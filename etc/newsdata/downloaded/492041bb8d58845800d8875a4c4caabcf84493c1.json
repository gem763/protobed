The experienced bushwalker broke his leg and wrist when he fell six metres down a waterfall at Mount Nebo in Queensland. 'My left foot just below my ankle, clean snapped in half,' he said. 'The whole bottom of my leg came loose.' Parker used hiking sticks to splint his leg, and took painkillers he had packed for an emergency, but said he had become emotional thinking about his family as he contemplated the possibility he would not survive", "description": "Neil Parker says he had to \u2018carry his leg\u2019 as he crawled 3km in two days after falling six metres down a waterfall at Mount Nebo, north-west of Brisbane", "authors": ["Source", "Qgair"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5e9454c626039c454929609bf8695a5e5303811/0_216_3736_2243/master/3736.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d70593805f65fb62ec26702abe0119ee", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
