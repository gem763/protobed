The utility said the second round of blackouts will mostly affect the Sierra Foothills and the northern part of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nPG&E pre-emptively turns off power in areas where there\u2019s the greatest risk of power lines or other infrastructure creating a wildfire. The utility was responsible for multiple wildfires last year, including the Camp Fire \u2014 the largest in state history \u2014 that killed more than 80 people.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized PG&E for the blackouts two weeks ago, which left as many as 2 million people without electricity. He said the utility should reimburse those affected who are inconvenienced \u2014 businesses that have to close and residents who have to stay in hotels and pay other costs of living.\n\nThe utility implemented the first of the planned blackouts on Oct. 9, anticipating strong wind gusts that it feared could damage power lines and start a fire. That plan included three phases of cutting power to more than 2 million residents in three dozen counties. The move was unprecedented in scale.\n\nThe new blackouts come after several new wildfires in California, including the Saddlebridge Fire near Los Angeles last week. It was then that PG&E CEO Bill Johnson first told the Public Utilities Commission more strategic blackouts may be necessary in the coming years, but said he doesn\u2019t expect major disruptions.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ll decrease in size and scope every year,\u201d he told the commission, which criticized the utility for its handling of the phased outages.\n\n\u201cYou guys failed on so many levels on pretty simple stuff,\u201d commission President Marybel Batjer said.\n\nDuring the last planned blackouts, PG&E\u2019s website crashed under the strain of residents seeking updates. The utility\u2019s call center was also overwhelmed. Newsom said he was \u201coutraged\u201d and the utility later said it wasn\u2019t adequately prepared for the planned outages.\n\nJohnson said Monday despite the inconvenience of the last wave of blackouts, they likely prevented a major wildfire.\n\n\u201cIf you look at where the damage occurred on the system, it was exactly in the area where we turned off the power,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might have turned it off a little quicker than we needed too, but the scope I think was correct.\u201d\n\nJohnson also warned that residents should get accustomed to these types of preventive measures \u2014 for the next decade, in fact, while PG&E makes its power lines and other infrastructure more resilient.\n\nThe utility\u2019s chief executive also suggested allowing state agencies the final say in the future on whether and when \u201cpublic safety power shutoffs\u201d are needed.", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 After millions of California residents were put in the dark two weeks ago by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state\u2019s largest", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
