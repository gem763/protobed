The employee, identified as Curtis Ewbank, filed the complaint after the second crash. He did not respond to messages left by The Associated Press.\n\nThe Max is the newest and most fuel-efficient version of the Boeing 737, a plane that dates to the 1960s. Earlier this decade, Boeing tried to push the Max into production and service as quickly as possible because rival Airbus was already selling a similarly economical plane called the neo. Requiring additional pilot training on new cockpit systems could have further delayed Boeing\u2019s ability to start selling the Max.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Aviation Administration said that it is requiring airlines to inspect versions of the 737 that preceded the Max for possible cracks in parts that tie the wings to the body of the plane. The order covers more than 1,900 planes in the United States, including 165 that must be checked within a week.\n\nThe FAA said it acted after learning this month that cracks were found on a 737 that had undergone maintenance work in China, and inspectors found similar cracks in other planes that were being converted from passenger jets to cargo freighters.\n\nJohndroe said Boeing has given airlines details for carrying out the inspections and reporting results to the FAA.\n\nThe new, visual inspections of Boeing 737s will focus on parts called pickle forks, which tie the wings to the body of the plane. The FAA said each examination should take about an hour, and airlines must repair all cracks before the plane flies again. They also must report the results of their inspections.\n\nPickle-fork assemblies are designed to absorb the torque created by movement of the wings during flight, and it has long been assumed that they would last for the lifetime of a plane. The urgency of carrying out the inspections will vary by the age of each plane.\n\nThe FAA said it has not received any reports of pickle forks breaking during a flight.\n\nA spokesman for Southwest Airlines LUV, -2.49% , which has an all-Boeing 737 fleet including some older planes, said the carrier began inspections Tuesday during overnight hours and expects to meet the FAA deadlines without disruptions to its schedule. Southwest hasn\u2019t found any cracks, he said.\n\nAmerican Airlines and United Airlines said none of their 737s are old enough to need immediate inspections, and they will meet the deadlines.", "description": "A Boeing engineer filed an internal complaint alleging that company managers rejected a backup system that might have alerted pilots to problems linked to...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF541_boeing_ZG_20190312154044.jpg"}
