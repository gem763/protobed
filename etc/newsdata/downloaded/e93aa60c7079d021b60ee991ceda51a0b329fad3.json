Bipin Rawat told reporters Sunday that two of its soldiers and one civilian were killed during the fighting.\n\nRawat said the military destroyed three terrorist camps and artillery, killing between six and 10 Pakistani soldiers in retaliation for Pakistan shelling India during the night to create an avenue for sending terrorists into the country.\n\n\u201cWe had picked up some definite information that some of the terror camps north of Pir Panjal are active,\u201d Rawat told reporters after the attack. \u201cThe terrorists have arrived at these camps and they\u2019re likely to infiltrate [India]. Last evening an attempt was made at Tangdhar in which we suffered two of our soldiers getting killed, one civilian also died and all this was to ensure that they can push in the terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe Pakistan Armed Forces called Rawat\u2019s claims \u201cfalse\u201d and that no terrorist camps were hit in the \u201cunprovoked\u201d attack.\n\nArmy spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor accused India of performing a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation in order to justify attacking Pakistan and targeting civilians.\n\n\u201cSuch false claims by Indian Army are being made to suit vested domestic interests,\u201d Ghafoor said via Twitter. \u201cThis is against professional military ethos.\u201d\n\nThe two nuclear-armed countries have repeatedly attacked each other over the Line of Control, which separates the two countries, despite having made a cease-fire agreement in 2003.\n\nTensions between the two countries have been climbing since February when terrorists based in Pakistan committed a suicide attack in India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, killing some 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel. India blamed Pakistan for the attack and conducted airstrikes on Jaish-e-Mohammed camps in Pakistan.", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 India and Pakistan exchanged fire across the de facto border of the disputed Kashmir region while blaming the other for instigating", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
