He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n\u201cMr Boyle manipulated [Coleman], exercised control over her, imposed his will on her and instilled fear in her,\u201d said prosecutor Jason Neubauer. \u201cHe did this through emotional and physical abuse \u2013 demeaning her and striking her.\u201d\n\nWearing an ash-coloured blazer and grey shirt, Boyle sat in court with his parents, taking notes on a pink legal pad. Coleman, who has previously testified by way of video link, did not participate in the court proceedings.\n\nLawyers for former Taliban hostage say he\u2019s \u2018not easy to like\u2019 but didn\u2019t abuse wife Read more\n\nBoyle and Coleman, set off on a trip to central Asia after they married in 2011. Soon after entering Afghanistan, they were kidnapped by militants and transferred into the control of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network. The couple had three children during their five-year captivity.\n\nIn November 2017, the family was freed by Pakistani forces in a rescue operation. After their release, the young family moved to Ottawa, where they lived in an apartment until Boyle\u2019s arrest on 31 December 2017.\n\nBoyle\u2019s defence on Monday cast him as an unlikable but honest witness, but the prosecution suggested Boyle\u2019s testimony was motivated by self-interest and included \u201coutright lies\u201d.\n\nThe crown pointed to instances in which Boyle\u2019s testimony shifted to evade incriminating behaviour, which Neubauer suggested \u201creflect[ed] poorly on his honesty as a witness\u201d.\n\nEarlier in the morning, Boyle\u2019s team spent much of their time working to undermine the credibility of the testimony of Coleman who has accused Boyle of physically and sexually abusing her, both during captivity and during their time living in Canada.\n\nDefence counsel Lawrence Greenspon told the court that Coleman\u2019s history of anxiety attacks rendered her memory inaccurate and unreliable.\n\nThe defence also asked Justice Peter Doody to consider that Boyle and Coleman had recently experienced freedom after five years of captivity. While their marriage was \u201cpeculiar\u201d, they were nonetheless \u201cparents in freedom\u201d for the first time and should be afforded a level of \u201ctolerance\u201d when assessing the accused\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u201cMr Boyle is unorthodox. Mr Boyle is unusual,\u201d said Eric Granger, one of Boyle\u2019s lawyers. But the court shouldn\u2019t judge the accused\u2019s credibility on the basis of how much Boyle \u201cdeviates from the norm\u201d, said Granger.\n\nThe prosecution rejected this characterization of Boyle, suggesting his testimony was \u201crooted in fiction, not fact\u201d and must therefore be rejected by the court.\n\n\u201cBoyle\u2019s evidence must be rejected not because he holds unorthodox views,\u201d said Neubauer. \u201cThe crown suggests his evidence is unbelievable \u2026 because it self-serving. It was argumentative, internally inconsistent and incompatible with common sense.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution will continue its closing arguments on Wednesday. Boyle has opted for the trial to be overseen by a judge only.", "description": "Canadian Joshua Boyle was described as manipulative and abusive to his American wife after they returned from Afghanistan", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91567b24422f1a3343ea60cfd19bf6389234a04a/0_73_4388_2634/master/4388.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=096a5dbdeff7af83a6cf35d953257719", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
