She refused to be questioned without her solicitor and was permitted to leave. In August, she was granted refugee status.\n\nRecalling the meeting, the woman, who did not want to be named, told The Independent: \u201cThe man had my file on the table. He started speaking to me in my native language. He said the British government and the Zimbabwean government had agreed to send some of the Zimbabwean people back to their country.\n\n\u201cI was frightened, and very angry. Why was the British government allowing this person to be in their office? We are hiding here and they bring someone who I\u2019m running away from. How can you say Zimbabwe is okay now when people are being kidnapped, tortured?\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He wanted to know about my parents and relatives in Zimbabwe,\u201d the man said.\n\n\u201cI refused to give him information about myself. I was afraid \u2013 if they confirmed it was me, what would they do with that information? He wasn\u2019t even concerned about whether I was an asylum seeker.\u201d\n\nThe claimant bringing the court case, a woman known only as AG, was refused asylum on the grounds that while the Home Office accepted she was an anti-government protester, she was not of sufficient profile to attract adverse attention from government officials if returned to the country.\n\nShe and her legal representatives argued that the alleged Home Office policy of sharing information about failed asylum seekers with the Zimbabwean authorities \u201cfundamentally undermined\u201d this, as it would alert authorities to their cases.\n\nHer barrister, Rowan Pennington-Benton, said that if successful the case could force the Home Office to reassess the cases of at least 2,500 failed asylum seekers, and called on the department to provide clarity on the policy.\n\n\u201cWe need a proper explanation and therefore appreciation of the nature and scope of the agreement actually reached between the UK and the Zimbabwean governments,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCertainly, there are a lot of failed asylum seekers from Zimbabwe whose cases were effectively believed in terms of being anti-government work that they were doing, but who have been told they can be returned because they will slip under the radar.\n\n\u201cYet this is a policy that appears to put them above the radar, or slap bang in the middle of the radar.\u201d\n\nPaul Blomfield, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, who raised concerns about the policy earlier this year, said the policy contravened the principle of fair treatment of those seeking refuge and put individuals at risk of persecution.\n\n\u201cI have received many disturbing reports from constituents over the way that the Home Office is coordinating with the Zimbabwean government, by allowing their officials to interview asylum applicants in the UK,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cAll removals to Zimbabwe should be to be postponed while this political situation continues, and there are real concerns about the safety of returnees. The current Zimbabwean government should not be given this access to vulnerable asylum seekers.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cRe-documentation interviews are a standard part of Home Office process where an interview is required by the receiving country to confirm identity and in order for a travel document to be produced.\u201d", "description": "The Home Office is to be challenged in court over its practice of inviting foreign\u00a0government representatives to interview political asylum seekers after The Independent exposed the \u201ccorrupt\u201d exercise.", "authors": ["May Bulman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/17/home-office.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
