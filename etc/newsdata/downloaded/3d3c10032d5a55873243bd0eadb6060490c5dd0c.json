(Frederic J. Brown/AFP)\n\nIf the fourth Democratic presidential debate goes anything like the last three, the candidates will spar vigorously tonight over how to get health coverage to more Americans.\n\nBut so far, in their fixation on how people obtain insurance, they\u2019ve spent little time debating the skyrocketing costs for premiums, deductibles and medications that affect tens of millions of people who already have health plans.\n\nThat could be a missed opportunity. New research shows that Democratic-leaning voters actually want to hear more from the 2020 candidates about how to lower health-care costs for everyone \u2014 not just get coverage to those who don't have it.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation poll released today.found majorities of such voters feel the candidates have spent too little time talking about health-care costs, surprise medical bills and reproductive health \u2014 and enough, or even too much, time discussing Medicare-for-all.\n\nAmong the poll\u2019s findings:\n\n58 percent of Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters said the candidates are spending too little time discussing women\u2019s health care\n\n52 percent said they\u2019re spending too little time on surprise medical bills\n\n50 percent said they\u2019re spending too little time on how to lower the cost of health care\n\n47 percent said they\u2019re spending too little time on the cost of prescription drugs\n\nAs 12 candidates take the stage at Otterbein University outside Columbus, Ohio, they\u2019ll have yet another chance. Health care is an issue that got more airtime than any other topic (21 percent of all words spoken in all three debates combined, according to this Bloomberg analysis). Candidates have spent the first half-hour of each debate debating various iterations of Medicare-for-all versus the public option approach and whether to trash or keep employer-sponsored coverage (check out our past Health 202s here, here and here).\n\nWhile the discussions have been unusually detailed for a televised debate \u2014 something that pleases your Health 202 author \u2014 the candidates have been criticized even by experts for having a relatively narrow focus despite a whole universe of ongoing and troublesome problems with how Americans access health care.\n\n\u201cThey are arguing endlessly about the subsidiary question of \u2018how\u2019 universal coverage would be achieved: with or without the availability of private employer-based insurance,\u201d Andy Slavitt, who oversaw the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama, wrote in a recent USA Today op-ed.\n\n\u201cAmericans need a bigger picture, and with President Donald Trump claiming that Democrats \u2018want to take away your health care,\u2019 they need a more accurate picture,\u201d Slavitt wrote.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) talk during the third Democratic primary debate. (Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDiscussions of Medicare-for-all and the public option are interesting and important, because they get at how to expand health coverage to the remaining 27 million Americans without it (although about half of them are already eligible for Medicaid or government subsidies to buy private plans).\n\nBut the polling reflects the ongoing struggle in the United States to make health insurance and prescription drugs affordable, problems Congress has said it wants to tackle this year. Both employer-sponsored plans, which cover 160 million Americans, and those available in the state-based marketplaces have suffered from rising premiums and increasingly steep deductibles.\n\nThose problems won\u2019t necessarily be solved even if universal health coverage is achieved. Even the 2010 ACA \u2014 the most sweeping health-care reform law in decades \u2014 didn\u2019t bend the health-care cost curve even as it expanded coverage to about 20 million people.\n\nSo some health policy experts are arguing the candidates would do better to focus on the cost of health insurance and prescription drugs for consumers and suggest ways to mitigate those costs.\n\n\u201cI tend to think the affordability point is more important than the coverage one,\u201d Bob Kocher, who worked on health policy issues at the National Economic Council under Obama, told me.\n\nIn his op-ed, Slavitt called on the Democratic candidates to lay out a vision for reforming health-care payments so they encourage better-quality care, improving lagging maternal health, combating opioid abuse and encouraging healthy behaviors that reduce the need for care.\n\nSeveral of the candidates, including South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) have laid out health-care proposals that go beyond just how to expand health coverage.\n\nBut whether the candidates go beyond their differences over Medicare-for-all in tonight\u2019s debate remains to be seen.\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy.

(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nAHH: The debate could also bring questions about the health of the candidates themselves.\n\nTwo weeks after his heart attack, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and his advisers know he'll have to prove he can be strong enough to take on President Trump in a general election. The campaign anticipates his heart attack will be addressed by the moderators, the New York Times\u2019s Sydney Ember reports.\n\n\u201cHis health issues have cast a degree of uncertainty over his campaign and left his aides rushing to reassure voters about his age and health, just as he was trying to improve his standing in a race that in recent weeks has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,\u201d Sydney reports. \u201cAides have said they expect Mr. Sanders to come across as energetic as ever and have rebuffed questions about whether he can handle standing for so long onstage.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, as the health and age of the candidates have become a critical yet sometimes unspoken issue, Warren has seemingly taken chances to show off her fitness on the campaign trail, the Los Angeles Times\u2019s Janet Hook reports.\n\n\u201cIn the now-famous selfie-photo lines that are the capstone of her campaign rallies, Warren stays on her feet for hours greeting voters individually. Opening her rallies, she typically jogs to the podium,\u201d she writes. \u201c\u2026 Warren has largely escaped questioning about her age, but she will be standing next to the youngest of her rivals, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who has campaigned on the need for generational change.\u201d\n\nPaul Farrell Jr., a West Virginia attorney driving a massive lawsuit against drug companies. (Maddie McGarvey for The Washington Post)\n\nOOF: Paul Farrell Jr. is a small-city lawyer taking on the nation\u2019s biggest drug companies over the opioid crisis. His hometown in West Virginia has been at the center of the epidemic, and he\u2019s now one of three attorneys leading the national legal challenge that\u2019s set to begin Monday in federal court in Cleveland, our Washington Post colleague Joel Achenbach reports in this profile.\n\nFarrell is \u201cone of the backstage masterminds of the litigation, which now includes more than 2,600 communities,\u201d Joel writes. \u201cThe plaintiffs argue that the nation\u2019s biggest drug companies \u2014 manufacturers, distributors and retailers \u2014 recklessly peddled opioid painkillers and fueled a wave of addiction.\u201d\n\nHe helped create a strategy around a state statute that says counties have the legal right to abate a public nuisance. Requiring abatement means the drug manufactures could be required to pay billions of dollars to help the communities ravaged by opioids.\n\n\u201cThey broke it. So they need to fix it,\u201d Farrell said of the pharmaceutical companies. \u201cI want them to stop killing people. I want mothers to stop giving birth to babies addicted to opium. I want my friends and my friends\u2019 children to stop overdosing. I want to stop going to funerals.\u201d\n\nA man uses a vape as he walks on Broadway in New York City. (Andrew Kelly/Reuters)\n\nOUCH: The federal government has allowed e-cigarette and vaping devices to boom as part of a mostly unregulated industry over the course of a decade, the New York Times\u2019s Katie Thomas and Sheila Kaplan report.\n\n\u201cIn dozens of interviews, federal officials and public health experts described a lost decade of inaction, blaming an intense lobbying effort by the e-cigarette and tobacco industries, fears of a political backlash in tobacco-friendly states, bureaucratic delays, and a late reprieve by an F.D.A. commissioner who had previously served on the board of a chain of vaping lounges,\u201d they write.\n\nIn 2009, a pair of e-cigarette companies successfully sued the Food and Drug Administration for attempting to regulate the products as drugs \u2014 the agency instead had to treat them as tobacco products. In the last year of the Obama administration, officials rejected a plan to ban flavored e-cigarettes. In 2017, the agency under then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb delayed regulations that may have limited the e-cigarette products on the market.\n\nNow, officials are grappling with an alarming spate of vaping-related lung illnesses that have been reported in nearly every state. \u201cIt has to get bad enough before you can actually get down to what needs to get done,\u201d Robert M. Califf, a former FDA commissioner, told Katie and Sheila. \u201cAnd I guess in a way this is an example.\u201d\n\nAGENCY ALERT\n\n\u2014 Gottlieb tweeted that vaping products that contain THC, the main psychoactive component of marijuana, should be banned.\n\nHardware marketed explicitly for vaping THC oils helped popularize consumption through vaping. Use of concentrates is now the second most popular way to consume THC, behind burning the flower. This vaping has dangerous consequences and should be prohibited https://t.co/6o3VQHpjgk \u2014 Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) October 14, 2019\n\nOfficials say many of the people who have been sickened with the vaping-related illness reported using vaping products containing THC.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC, Gottlieb said that \u201cno one should be vaping THC. Putting something into the lungs is inherently dangerous and we just shouldn\u2019t allow the vaping of these concentrates.\u201d\n\nHe also called for federal regulations of marijuana markets. Gottlieb said states can\u2019t do the regulating themselves because they \u201cdon\u2019t have the capacity to both police what\u2019s being sold in their so-called legal dispensaries as well as shut down the black market \u2026 I think you\u2019re going to need federal authorities in there to do that.\u201d\n\nHe suggested the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration \u201ccould regulate what\u2019s being sold for the potency, for the manufacturing, for the ingredients, for the claims that are being made.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In the same interview, Gottlieb also said he\u2019s not sure vaping nicotine causes cancer in people, responding to a New York University study released last week that found e-cigarette vapor that has nicotine causes lung cancer in mice, CNBC\u2019s Jessica Bursztynsky reports.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m skeptical that nicotine causes cancer,\u201d Gottlieb said in the interview.\n\nHe said nicotine \u201cmight be a tumor promoter, [researchers] have said that there\u2019s a potential that nicotine is a tumor promoter, but it doesn\u2019t cause cancer.\u201d\n\nBut he added that he would still believe that inhaling vapor from e-cigarettes would damage lungs. \u201cYou can\u2019t inhale something into the lungs that way on a repeated basis and not cause some damage to the lung,\" he said.\n\n\u201cOut of 40 mice exposed in the study to e-cigarette vapor with nicotine over 54 weeks, 22.5% developed lung cancer and 57.5% developed precancerous lesions on the bladder,\u201d Jessica reports. \u201cNone of the 20 mice exposed to e-cigarette vaper without nicotine developed cancer over the four years they studied the mice, the researchers said.\u201d\n\nINDUSTRY RX\n\nThe Amazon logo. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File)\n\n\u2014 Employers like Amazon are increasingly paying to have their employees travel to certain hospitals for care, shopping around for select services instead of relying on local providers.\n\nThe upside is competitive prices and better care, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Melanie Evans reports, despite the downside of extra costs for airfare, hotels and gas, as well as time away from home. At Amazon, 380,000 employees are eligible for a travel benefit - the company is paying for employees diagnosed with cancer to travel to Los Angeles to see top doctors at the City of Hope health system. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\u201cEmployer health plans, which cover roughly 153 million people in the U.S., struggle to command competitive prices and quality controls in some markets as health-care providers have consolidated and gained leverage in negotiations,\u201d Melanie writes. \u201c\u2026By paying employees\u2019 way to travel for medical care, Amazon hopes to increase workers\u2019 choices and curb health spending by getting workers to top specialists and reducing the chance of the wrong diagnosis or treatment, said Dene Sparrman, the company\u2019s director of global benefits.\u201d\n\nCity of Hope didn\u2019t say how many Amazon workers have traveled there since the program began in April.\n\n\u2014 And here are a few more good reads:\n\nVaping illness, deaths likely very rare beyond U.S., experts say E-cigarette or vaping-linked lung injuries that have killed 29 and sickened more than 1,000 people in the United States are likely to be rare in Britain and other countries where the suspect products are not widely used, specialists said on Monday.
