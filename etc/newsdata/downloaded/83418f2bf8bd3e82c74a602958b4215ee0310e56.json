But at the same time, I was mesmerised,\" he said.\n\n\"Fragile\" was the one word he would use to sum up his feelings, evoking the urge to preserve what we have.\n\nBut you do not have to be one of the just over 500 people who have gone into space to see things his way, he said.\n\n\"You all can have the world in your window if you want. Look at what you see when you think of putting your vision out through the pane of a spacecraft.\n\n\"You see this little thing, you see it in its entirety... Is it fragile? Oh lordy, lordy, yes.\n\n\"Can some of those manifestations of fragility be corrected? Yes they can, if we put our minds to it.\"\n\nCollins, who served as an assistant secretary of state after Apollo 11, added that the world tour he made after the mission helped him realise how the crew's accomplishments did not belong to the US alone.\n\n\"Wherever we went, I thought people would say, well, 'You Americans finally did it.'\n\n\"And instead of that, everywhere, people said 'We did it, we humanity finally got off this little dinky planet and set foot elsewhere.'\"\n\n\"I think the United States has to be a power in the world, but a very friendly power and not an overbearing power, not a power that tries to be dominant,\" he concluded, as he called for a new era of global cooperation in space.", "description": "On their journey to the Moon, the Apollo 11 crew had to rotate their spaceship so that one side didn't \"barbecue\" in the Sun while the other froze - meaning they couldn't see their destination until they were almost upon it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6994/4d16d8f574d0427ea302ac3a02a485b5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-21"}
