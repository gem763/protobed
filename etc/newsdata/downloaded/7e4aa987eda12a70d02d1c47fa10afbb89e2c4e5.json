The only question is how long it will take.\n\nA decision Wednesday by Denmark to allow the contentious pipeline to cross its waters removed the final administrative hurdle to the construction of the Russia-led project.\n\nThe European Commission, along with Central Eastern European countries vehemently opposed to the project, accepted some time ago they had no legal grounds to stop Nord Stream 2\u2019s construction. But while Danish approval was ultimately expected, the convoluted and years-long permit granting process threw the project\u2019s timeline into uncertainty.\n\nWednesday\u2019s approval is cause for celebration for both Moscow and the company behind the project, as well as the pipeline\u2019s backers in Europe. But its timing is also expected to delay completion of the pipeline well into next year or even longer, as the window of opportunity for construction closes for the winter season.\n\nGermany applauded the decision. \u201cWith this last permit \u2066@NordStream2\u2069 can finally move forward,\u201d tweeted Miguel Berger, director general for economic affairs at the German Federal Foreign Office.\n\nRussia\u2019s Gazprom is the sole shareholder of the project but has financial backing from five West European companies.\n\n\u201cIt would not be possible to complete [the pipeline] by 2019,\u201d said Mateusz Kubiak, an oil and gas analyst with the Warsaw-based consulting firm Esperis.\n\nNord Stream 2 is meant to ship 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year through a 1,200-kilometre-long pipeline from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, doubling the existing route capacity. About 87 percent of the pipes have been laid in German, Finnish, Swedish and Russian waters, the company said.\n\nRussia\u2019s Gazprom is the sole shareholder of the project but has financial backing from five West European companies \u2014 Austria\u2019s OMV, Anglo-Dutch Shell, France\u2019s Engie and Germany\u2019s Uniper and Wintershall. Italy\u2019s Saipem and Swiss-based Allseas are helping with pipe laying.\n\nProponents, which include Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, say the project makes economic sense and the EU will need the gas.\n\nBut its construction has come under fire from the U.S. and many Central and Eastern European countries, worried the pipeline will boost the Kremlin\u2019s influence and allow Russia to end gas transit via cash-strapped Ukraine.\n\nThe construction permit received from the Danish Energy Agency Wednesday is a victory for Nord Stream 2, which had grown increasingly frustrated over the process.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to have obtained Denmark\u2019s consent to construct the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline through the Danish continental shelf area,\u201d Samira Kiefer Andersson, the company\u2019s permitting manager, said in a statement.\n\nThe agency approved the company\u2019s third requested route application, which would see the pipeline going southeast of Denmark\u2019s Bornholm island in the Baltic Sea.\n\nDocuments the company submitted as part of its last application show the project could face at least a six-month delay under that route proposal. It\u2019s also expected to cost an extra \u20ac660 million on top of the original budget of \u20ac9.5 billion.\n\nSebastian Sass, EU representative for Nord Stream 2, said the construction of the pipeline in Danish waters will start in \u201cdue time.\u201d\n\n\"Therefore, the window closes by tomorrow and Nord Stream wouldn\u2019t be able to do that until mid-May 2020\" \u2014 Mateusz Kubiak, analyst with consulting firm Esperis\n\n\u201cThe actual start of construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors. This will take a few weeks,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s goal, he added, is to complete the project \u201cin the coming months.\u201d\n\nSeasonal issues\n\nAfter the Danish section is completed, the laid pipelines have to be connected to the German sections through a special procedure. That can only happen between mid-May and the end of October, according to the permit from German authorities, due to environmental concerns.\n\n\"Therefore, the window closes by tomorrow and Nord Stream wouldn\u2019t be able to do that until mid-May 2020,\" Kubiak said.\n\nThe permit granted Wednesday was Nord Stream 2\u2019s third attempt at getting approval for a route through Danish waters, after it submitted a new application in April at the request of the country\u2019s energy regulator.\n\nIt already had an application pending for a route through Denmark\u2019s exclusive economic zone northwest of Bornholm island, on which the regulator has not yet ruled. In June, the company withdrew its 2017 original route application through Denmark\u2019s territorial waters, which the foreign minister could have vetoed based on foreign and security concerns.\n\nWhen it submitted the third application, Nord Stream 2 said the regulator\u2019s request \u201ccan only be seen as a deliberate attempt to delay the project\u2019s completion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Ukraine policy having recently entered the domestic U.S. arena, there probably is not much appetite in Congress to engage in a policy related to the Ukrainian gas sector\u201d \u2014 Brenda Shaffer, Georgetown University adjunct professor\n\nDanish Climate and Energy Minister Dan J\u00f8rgensen in August pushed back against those accusations in an interview, saying \"we are not deliberately delaying anything.\u201d\n\nA further complication could come from the United States, where lawmakers have mulled sanctions against companies helping with Nord Stream 2\u2019s construction.\n\nKubiak confirmed successful sanctions would cause further delays, potentially leaving Russian companies to complete the project.\n\nHowever, a sanctions bill submitted by U.S. Republican Senator Ted Cruz is languishing in the Senate after gaining bipartisan support in committees. A similar bill in the House of Representatives has been stuck in committee for months. Asked whether time was running out for the U.S. to pass sanctions, Cruz merely responded \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nBrenda Shaffer, adjunct professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies, said the prospect of sanctions is becoming more distant \u2014 particularly given the pipeline\u2019s Ukraine connections.\n\n\u201cWith Ukraine policy having recently entered the domestic U.S. arena, there probably is not much appetite in Congress to engage in a policy related to the Ukrainian gas sector,\u201d she said, referring to the current impeachment procedures against U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAnthony Adragna and Ben Lefebvre contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Energy and Climate.
