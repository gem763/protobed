When it came to choosing a romantic partner, she advised Simon to \"marry up,\" Simon told NBC. \"You\u2019ve got to find somebody who's gonna make your lineage stronger, who's going to give you the best possible children, who's going to support you, who's going to have a great position in life in his workplace,\" the musician recalled Jackie saying.\n\nSimon didn't end up marrying a Jackie-approved man, though. \"I don't think she thought marrying an artist was such a good idea,\" Simon said, referring to her first husband, James Taylor. \"And when I got married to Jim [Hart], my second husband, she at first was not in favor of that because Jim was not a provider in the sense that she thought women should have a provider as their husband.\"\n\nView photos Photo credit: Santiago Felipe - Getty Images More\n\nStill, that didn't get in the way of their friendship. They'd still meet up for nights at the theater, where Simon always knew to find Jackie trying to stay under-the-radar by hiding out the bathroom. (Simon would identify her as the one \"with her little Gucci shoes sticking out from underneath the\" stalls.)\n\nThe pair were close enough that Jackie even spoke to Simon about JFK's affairs. \"In a cheerful but resigned way, she told me that of course she knew about them,\" Simon says Touched by the Sun. \"She just didn't mind their presence as much as she might have. Because she knew he loved her much, much more than any of his dalliances.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"You\u2019ve got to find somebody who's gonna make your lineage stronger, who's going to give you the best possible children, who's going to support you, who's going to have a great position in life in his workplace,\" she said.", "authors": ["Chloe Foussianes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pgKunLSnmDCq58YxfiLCCQ--~B/aD04ODY7dz0xNzY0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/bf36f74cf1d1729e4a3246c93b6d3162", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
