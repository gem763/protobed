Many delegates this year have no qualms about getting close to Saudi.\"\n\nATTENTION ON ARAMCO IPO\n\nGlobal banks and consultants are vying for business around the much-delayed initial public offering of state oil giant Aramco, the world's most profitable company.\n\nThe kingdom plans to list as much as five per cent of Aramco, which analysts say could be worth between US$1.5 trillion and US$2 trillion.\n\n\"I expect that many international observers as well as most attendees will pay more attention to the delayed Aramco IPO than to the Khashoggi legacy,\" said Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics.\n\nThe global fallout over Khashoggi's killing rendered Prince Mohammed a pariah, testing alliances with Western powers and casting a shadow on his ambitious reform agenda aimed at weaning the kingdom off its dependence on oil.\n\nThe CIA has reportedly concluded that the crown prince, who controls all major levers of power in the Saudi government, likely ordered the gruesome killing.\n\nPrince Mohammed has said that he accepts responsibility, because it happened \"under my watch\" - but denied having ordered it.\n\nSome global companies seeking to sidestep any reputational risks of doing business with Saudi Arabia will avoid the conference but are likely to pursue meetings on the sidelines, observers say.\n\nAs it attempts to draw a line under the Khashoggi scandal, the Saudi government has hosted Western musicians at dazzling entertainment events, eased restrictions on women's rights and started issuing tourist visas for the first time.\n\nBut Riyadh has struggled to attract the foreign investment it needs, especially since a 2017 crackdown when the palatial Ritz-Carlton hotel, the venue for the FII, was turned into a five-star prison for hundreds of Saudi business executives and some royal family members.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [RIYADH] Top finance moguls and political leaders are set to attend a Davos-style Saudi investment summit starting on Tuesday, in contrast to last year when outrage over critic Jamal Khashoggi's murder sparked a mass boycott. .
