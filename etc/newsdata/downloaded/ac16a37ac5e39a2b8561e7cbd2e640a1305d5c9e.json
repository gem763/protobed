Seoul will discuss the issue closely with the tour operator and come up with a response.\"When asked about the possibility of North Korea unilaterally destroying South Korean buildings at the resort should the two sides fail to reach an agreement, an unnamed unification ministry official said it's difficult to judge.Seoul says it will be discussing the issue with Hyundai Asan and decide whether to send a reply to the North.Oh Jung-hee, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
