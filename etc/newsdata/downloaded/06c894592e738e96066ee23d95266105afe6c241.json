For millennials, it feels more like a fantasy.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nA scene from \u201cHouse Hunters,\u201d HGTV\u2019s low-budget, formulaic crown jewel. (HGTV)\n\nWhen \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d premiered on Sept. 30, 1999, Kathleen Harward and Devon Mahallati were just 3 years old. They grew up watching the HGTV series with their parents in New Jersey, then obsessing over it with each other, and now the two best friends run a \u201cHouse Hunters Screens\u201d Instagram account, dedicated entirely to showcasing closed-captioned screen shots from the network\u2019s flagship show for their nearly 12,000 followers.\n\nTheir Instagram audience is mostly women in their early to mid-20s who appreciate the \u201cquotable\u201d nature of the series, says Harward, a graduate student at the University of Washington. Neither of the 23-year-olds actually has cable. When they shared a rental house post-college, they streamed episodes on Hulu, and they currently watch from opposite coasts on the HGTV app using Harward\u2019s parents\u2019 account.\n\n\u201cWe take screen shots of what we think is the funniest or most beautiful screen,\u201d says Mahallati, a Brooklyn-based photographer. \u201cThey have such beautiful, creative shots that we thought other people needed to see this and appreciate it like we do.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re not alone. Combined, millennial and Gen Z viewers make up a significant portion of HGTV\u2019s audience. The network\u2019s unscripted programming is decidedly uncool and yet endlessly appealing. And for generations coming of age post-recession (and possibly living on the brink of another), shows like \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d offer both an escape from global chaos and a window into the seemingly distant fantasy of homeownership.\n\n\n\nBuilding a predictable brand\n\nTwenty years after its debut, \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d is HGTV\u2019s no-risk crown jewel. What began as a 26-episode run in 1999 has since ballooned into hundreds of episodes per year across more than a dozen spinoffs. Low budget, incredibly formulaic and lacking any prestige or even a host, \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d consistently ranks among the top 10 of all cable shows, thriving largely on its predictability.\n\nLike most HGTV programming, it airs in blocks. Every weeknight at 10 p.m., then again at 1 a.m., night owls and insomniacs can get their soothing fix of \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d and its most popular spinoff, \u201cHouse Hunters International.\u201d\n\nEach 22-minute episode stands alone and follows an identical procedure: A home buyer, often a couple, searches for a new place to live that fits their price range and criteria. A local real estate agent shows them three houses. They choose one.\n\nAlong the way, there will be quibbles about open floor plans vs. heritage charm, lack of closet space, an outdated kitchen or atrocious commute times. One property is guaranteed to be beyond their budget. As the credits roll, they\u2019ll appear blissfully happy in their new abode, often toasting their good fortune over a cheese board.\n\nWhile prestige TV may attract the Emmys, the monotony of \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d attracts the entire household, says Shawn Shimpach, an associate professor of cinema studies at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportunity to spend low-stakes time peeking into other people\u2019s domestic lives,\u201d says Shimpach, who wrote the academic article \u201cRealty Reality: HGTV and the Subprime Crisis.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s some appeal in seeing how they interact with each other, how they interact with a [real estate agent] and the kinds of values they have when they\u2019re looking for homes. You play along by deciding, which would I choose? And so, am I like these people, or am I different from these people?\u201d\n\nQuirkier demands, such as the Texas man who would only consider homes featuring a castle turret (Season 165, Episode 13) or the \u201cHouse Hunters International\u201d family in Germany who listed \u201cno ghosts\u201d among their criteria (Season 133, Episode 7), keep things exciting.\n\nAt times, buyers\u2019 budgets are seemingly at odds with their job descriptions, a trend that helped launch a thousand memes and the \u201cHouse Hunters Plot\u201d Twitter account, which uses a bot to generate imagined show dialogue like: \u201cHUSBAND: I build fainting couches out of common walnut. WIFE: And I watch. BOTH, IN UNISON: Our budget is $2.4 million.\u201d\n\nWIFE: I make swimming costumes for turtles\n\nHUSBAND: And I'm a guinea pig clerk\n\nWIFE: Our budget is $1.2 million \u2014 House Hunters Plot (@HouseBudgets) September 24, 2019\n\nComing of age in a recession\n\nIn 2009, during the Great Recession, Time listed Burton Jablin, head of HGTV\u2019s then-\n\nparent company Scripps Networks, as one of its \u201c25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis,\u201d claiming that channels like HGTV \u201chelped inflate the real estate bubble by teaching viewers how to extract value from their homes,\u201d while shows like \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d gave \u201cthe housing game glamour and gusto.\u201d\n\nBut for millennial viewers just leaving school and entering the job market during the collapse, \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d offered an idealized glimpse into a rapidly receding dream.\n\n\u201cHomeownership has been an aspect of the American Dream for much longer than HGTV has been around. On television, it\u2019s been a feature at least since \u2018Leave it to Beaver\u2019 and \u2018Father Knows Best,\u2019 \u201d Shimpach says. \u201cBut what HGTV offers through its reality programming is the impression of demystifying the homeownership process: You\u2019ve heard that homeownership is the dream \u2014 here you can see it being made accessible.\u201d\n\nAround the same time that the housing bubble burst, HGTV ramped up the episode count on \u201cHouse Hunters,\u201d ensuring new clips were available multiple times a week throughout the year, an endless parade of properties to tantalize a rent-check-writing audience.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t own a home, so I was hooked on seeing what kind of houses are out there, what kind of houses these other people were getting,\u201d 28-year-old fan Jake Colvin says. \u201cIt gave me a sense of jealousy, sort of envy, like, man, I wish that could be me getting that house.\u201d\n\nFor the last decade, American real estate has been a seller\u2019s market, and the barrier to first-time homeownership continues to rise. The U.S. median home price reached a record high of $300,000 this March, per Realtor.com. Still, ownership remains a goal for most millennials, says Jessica Lautz, vice president of Demographics and Behavioral Insights at the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\u201cAll the research consistently says that non-owners do want to own homes in the future. But the biggest hurdle in obtaining homeownership is really the financial barrier,\u201d Lautz says. \u201cSo whether that\u2019s their own student loan debt or just saving up for a down payment when they have a high rental cost already, it becomes very difficult for that potential buyer to enter the market.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlorida homeowner Amanda Robinson, 29, sits on her front porch. Robinson appeared on \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d in an episode called \u201cLike Mother Unlike Daughter in Tallahassee.\u201d (Phillip Kelly)\n\nIt\u2019s difficult, but not impossible. In fact, millennials \u2014 identified by NAR as those born between 1980 and 1998 \u2014 currently make up the largest generation and the largest share of home buyers in the United States.\n\nBut since 1996, the net worth of Americans ages 18 to 35 has dropped 34 percent, and often, those with higher incomes who can afford to purchase still require some assistance.\n\nNearly one-quarter of first-time buyers move directly from a family member\u2019s home into homeownership, and more than one-third of first-time buyers receive a gift or loan from family or friends, according to NAR research.\n\nWhen Amanda Robinson, a 29-year-old athletic trainer at Florida State University, appeared on a February 2019 episode of \u201cHouse Hunters,\u201d she came armed with a $180,000 budget and down-payment assistance from her parents. With her mom in tow, Robinson found her dream first home in Tallahassee, complete with her desired front porch and a shed for DIY projects.\n\n\u201cMillennials are pretty uninformed on the whole home-\n\nbuying process,\u201d she says. \u201cI have so many friends who have reached out to me [since the show] saying, \u2018I\u2019m thinking about buying a house \u2014 what funding did you get?\u2019 We just don\u2019t talk about it because we don\u2019t even think it\u2019s within our reach.\u201d\n\nStaged to perfection\n\nWhile \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d may help demystify the buying process for viewers who\u2019ve never experienced it for themselves, it also presents a staged version of reality.\n\nIt\u2019s an open secret that most \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d buyers, including Robinson, have already closed on a home before appearing on the show. The two additional properties shown are usually chosen by producers, recycled from the buyers\u2019 now-\n\nfinished hunt or staged by obliging friends.\n\nDomestic buyers are typically paid $500 to film around 50 hours of footage, which is then edited down into a single, conclusive episode.\n\n\u201cTo maximize production time, we seek out families who are pretty far along in the process,\u201d a publicist for the series told Entertainment Weekly in 2012. \u201c . . . Showcasing three homes makes it easier for our audience to \u2018play along\u2019 and guess which one the family will select.\u201d\n\nAndromeda Dunker, the show\u2019s voice-over narrator since 2009, stresses that while the show, like any reality series, is produced, the only thing scripted is her commentary. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t produced, it would just be, like, you follow a couple around to see 90 different houses, and the shoot would be a year long for one episode,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would just be someone\u2019s home video of a house search. No one wants to see that.\u201d\n\nFor Colvin, watching \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d inspired him to become a real estate agent in his native Oregon, and, he says, many of his clients approached the home-buying process as if they were participants on the show.\n\n\u201cIt was interesting to have some really heart-to-heart conversations with people letting them know there\u2019s a lot of misconceptions from what\u2019s on TV versus reality,\u201d he says. \u201cThe show made it seem like just about anybody can place an offer on a home. But if it\u2019s a seller\u2019s market, your chances of getting the house you want are going to be a lot slimmer because there\u2019s way more competition. There are so many buyers making an offer on a home that the home ends up selling for $50,000 more than the asking price. There are more conflicts in the real world than were portrayed on the show.\u201d\n\nColvin himself became disillusioned with the risky nature of real estate, and he now focuses full time on his personal Instagram and TikTok accounts, where he\u2019s amassed 1.6 million followers. \u201cI\u2019m trying to eliminate the bad, negative stress in my life and come up with a healthier stress, I suppose,\u201d he says.\n\nAn on-screen utopia\n\nSince its inception, \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d has cast an array of buyers inclusive of age, race, sexual orientation and location. With little fanfare, it presents people from all backgrounds seamlessly achieving the same domestic goal of purchasing a home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the diversity of the house hunters we featured on the show \u2014 single, divorced, interracial couples, same sex couples \u2014 and yet we didn\u2019t point it out,\u201d original host Suzanne Whang, who appeared on the series until 2007, told The Washington Post in her final interview; she died this month after battling breast cancer for 13 years. \u201cI never said \u2018Interracial Sheila and Tom\u2019 or \u2018Gay Ron and Bryan.\u2019 Any contribution the show made to increasing acceptance, compassion and tolerance in this country is a very good thing.\u201d\n\nWhile on-screen representation is important, the show\u2019s lack of commentary ignores the substantial imbalance that exists across home-buying populations in the United States. Black homeownership rates are at record lows, for example, and research shows prospective buyers of color often face discrimination when attempting to secure a mortgage. While 72.9 percent of white Americans own a home, that number drops to 43 percent for African Americans and 46.2 percent for Hispanic Americans.\n\n\u201cThis is a show that is incredibly inclusive, and there are all sorts of people who historically have been excluded from the home-buying process who are now, without comment, just naturally included [on \u2018House Hunters\u2019]. You have to erase a lot of reality in order to not comment upon that,\u201d Shimpach says. \u201cAnd in certain neighborhoods and homeowners\u2019 associations, your sexuality, your ethnicity, even your gender can be a factor [in buying a home]. It\u2019s great that everybody is shown as sharing in this dream, but the reality is not quite the same.\u201d\n\nEscaping the noise\n\nIn 2017, Discovery purchased Scripps Networks Interactive for $11.9 billion, and last year, HGTV was the fourth most-watched cable network behind Fox News, ESPN and CNN.\n\nAs other channels splinter to attract viewers on shock value or breaking news, HGTV remains a haven in a time when millennials and Gen Z Americans report the highest levels of stress. \u201cHGTV used to refer to itself as \u2018shelter TV,\u2019 which has at least a double meaning,\u201d Shimpach notes. \u201cIt\u2019s shelter in that it\u2019s about homes and places that you stay, but it also feels like a kind of television that you can shelter in and protect yourself from some of the other things that are going on in the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a year full of tumultuous presidential election coverage, HGTV placed third in the ratings, beating CNN.\n\n\u201cPeople want to just relax from the violence in the world and what\u2019s on the news,\u201d says Dunker. \u201cIt\u2019s always on in doctors\u2019 offices and hospital waiting rooms because there\u2019s no bad news on \u2018House Hunters.\u2019 Maybe there\u2019s a disagreement about a shower head, but it\u2019s not life or death.\u201d\n\n\n\nA scene from \u201cHouse Hunters International,\u201d the most popular of more than a dozen \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d spinoffs. (HGTV)\n\nAnd then there\u2019s \u201cHouse Hunters International.\u201d While the Trump administration leans into an insular America, the globe-trotting spinoff, which debuted in 2006 and is now in its 147th season, highlights a subset of Americans moving abroad \u2014 \u00adeither relocating temporarily to work or have a second home, or emigrating permanently.\n\n\u201cI prefer watching \u2018International,\u2019 because Americans\u2019 expectations versus the reality of what they\u2019re getting into is always off,\u201d says \u201cHouse Hunters Screens\u201d co-creator Mahallati. \u201cThey expect a grand kitchen and a full bathroom with two sinks, and it\u2019s never that. And I really like that where they go internationally is not typically a capital city. You can really get a sense of what these other towns are like, and it\u2019s eye-opening.\u201d\n\nIn addition to \u201cHouse Hunters International,\u201d the juggernaut franchise now encompasses an ever-growing catalogue of spinoffs, including newer attempts at millennial-enticing fare like \u201cTiny House Hunters\u201d and \u201cRoommate Hunters.\u201d Still, the original reigns supreme. And for younger fans, perhaps it isn\u2019t dangling a lost hope but rather showing just one possible avenue to achieving hope anew.\n\n\u201cI thought I would be married and have kids when I bought a house because that\u2019s what our parents did, but now you see people like myself \u2014 a young, single female \u2014 buying a house and saying the American Dream has changed,\u201d says Robinson, the Tallahassee homeowner. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not so much having a family and a house and a car and everything; it\u2019s just making yourself happy.\u201d", "description": "The long-running HGTV series is an escape for younger viewers, as a well as a reminder of what they are unlikely to have.", "authors": ["Ashley Spencer", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gP0oyYf9rnl6KIQNmOQZx1uax_o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WWSVSSG73UI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
