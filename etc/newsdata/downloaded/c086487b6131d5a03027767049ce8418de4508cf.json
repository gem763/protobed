The remains of two more boys were found nearby.\n\nLocal media reported three other children from the area had been missing since the middle of the year and another child had disappeared late last week after the bodies were found.\n\n\u201cRecovering the three bodies from the same spot indicates that there might be a serial killer involved in this episode,\u201d regional police officer Zulfiqar Hameed told Reuters.\n\nDistrict Police Officer Zahid Nawaz told Reuters on Monday that DNA samples of the 20 suspects held in custody had been sent for testing.\n\nHundreds of people demonstrated about the killings last week, blocking off streets and damaging shops.\n\n\u201cI nurtured my child for eight years ... I cannot bear this, I want justice,\u201d Amtal Salam, the mother of Faizan, told Reuters on Thursday in the living room of her family home that overlooks the grave of her young son.\n\nChunian, where the bodies were found, is located in Kasur, a district just south of the city of Lahore, that has been hit by waves of sexual assault and violence against children, which many locals say has continued due to a culture of impunity and lack of action in finding perpetrators.\n\nVideos of hundreds of local children being sexually assaulted were found circulating in 2015, which a senior child protection official at the time called the worst child abuse incident in Pakistan\u2019s history.\n\nLast year, the body of a 7-year-old girl was found in a garbage dumpster, which police said was the 12th incident of a girl being abducted, raped and killed in Kasur in a year, and sparked violent protests. A man was convicted of the murder and executed.\n\nChild advocates say Pakistan has a serious problem with child abuse, with child protection watchdog Sahil reporting more than 3,800 cases of sexual abuse and violence against children cases in 2018.\n\n\u201cChild abuse is a huge, huge challenge, not just in Kasur, but these cases are coming in a lot and are being reported in Punjab on a daily basis,\u201d said Sarah Ahmad, chairperson of the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau for Punjab, the province in which Kasur is located.\n\nLocals say children are fearful of going outside.\n\n\u201cAnnouncements have been made that parents should escort their children to school,\u201d said Shehnaz Bibi, a woman from a village near Chunian. \u201cThe children are afraid to go to the mosques; they are afraid to go to school.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan has vowed law enforcement will be held accountable and said a major overhaul of district police was under way as well as an investigation into the incident.", "description": "Pakistani police have detained 20 suspects as they investigate the possibility of a serial killer being behind the suspected murder and sexual assault of three boys in a district which has a history of child abuse and abduction.", "authors": ["Mubasher Bukhari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433042923&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1QT", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
