REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis\n\nPrivate vehicles will only be allowed to use roads on alternate days during the period, Arvind Kejriwal told a news conference, depending on whether their registration plate ends in an odd or even number.\n\nThe city also aims to introduce 1,000 electric buses, Kejriwal said, as well as policies to promote other electric vehicles.\n\nNew Delhi is the world\u2019s most polluted capital city, according to several studies, plagued by vehicle and industrial emissions, dust from building sites, and smoke from the burning of rubbish and crop residue in nearby fields.\n\n\u201cPollution levels have come down in Delhi recently, and we\u2019re determined and committed to bring them down further and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to introduce these steps,\u201d Kejriwal said. The Delhi government has identified \u201cpollution hot spots\u201d it can target to help improve air quality in the city, he said.\n\nThe Delhi government would also distribute free face masks in the city, he said, as part of efforts to encourage people to reduce their exposure to polluted air. Unlike in other polluted cities in the world, it is still rare in Delhi to see people taking measures to reduce exposure to pollution, such as wearing face masks.\n\nAs winter approaches each year, wind speeds tend to drop after the monsoon season that ends in September, meaning smog and other pollutants hang in the air. The problem is exacerbated as people let off fireworks to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali in late October or early November.\n\nNorth Indian cities, including Delhi, top a list of places with the worst air in the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe WHO database of more than 2,600 cities shows that 14 of the 18 most polluted cities on the planet are in northern India, based on the amount of particulate matter under 2.5 micrograms in size found in every cubic meter of air.\n\nThese tiny particles, known as PM2.5, include dust, dirt, soot and smoke. They can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the blood. They have been linked to heart disease, strokes and cancer.", "description": "India's capital New Delhi will enforce strict restrictions on use of private cars from Nov. 4-15 to curb pollution, its chief minister said on Friday, in an effort to help improve air quality that tends to deteriorate sharply in winter months.", "authors": ["Alasdair Pal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429347434&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0HK", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
