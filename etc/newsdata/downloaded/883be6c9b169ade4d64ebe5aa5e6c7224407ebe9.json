So I thought, 'why not freeze it myself? It works amazingly well.'\n\nWhen freezing avocados, the trick is to peel the fruit, removed the pit and make sure you slice if first (stock image)\n\nWhile many believe that unpeeled avocados will continue to brown in the freezer this is not the case, as long as you follow her instructions.\n\n'I buy a fresh avocado, cut it in half, take the pit out and slice it. You can cut it into chunks too,' she said.\n\n'I lay it out on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze.'\n\nAfter a day of freezing she removes the individual slices, places them into one freezer bag so she can use them one slice at a time.\n\nBy freezing them first, it prevents the slices from sticking together in the bags.", "description": "An Australian chef and a cafe owner have spoken about whether or not they'd serve avocados which have been frozen to their customers.", "authors": ["Emilia Mazza", "Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/03/20233286-0-image-a-9_1572146640123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
