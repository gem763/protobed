That represents a rise from 41 percent in May, when the cable network last asked the question.\n\nAD\n\nBoth surveys come as Trump is coming under increasing scrutiny for a July phone call in which he urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter Biden at a time when the White House had suspended military aid to Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nHouse Democrats launched an impeachment investigation into Trump on Sept. 24. In the ensuing days, a rough transcript of the call and a redacted version of a complaint by an anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the controversy were released by the White House.\n\nOn Monday, pressure on the White House escalated as three House committees issued a subpoena to Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, demanding that he turn over all records pertaining to his contacts regarding Ukraine, the Biden family and related matters.\n\nAD\n\nOther recent polls have found Americans roughly divided over impeachment.\n\nThe CNN poll and the Quinnipiac survey found movement among political independents, a critical group that has consistently opposed impeachment.\n\nThe CNN poll shows an 11-point rise in support for impeachment among independents, from 35 percent in May to 46 percent. In the Quinnipiac poll, independents\u2019 support for impeaching Trump has grown from 34 percent a week ago to 42 percent through Sunday; a majority of independents, however, say Trump should not be impeached and removed from office.\n\nAD\n\nIn the Quinnipiac poll, another big reason for the shift appears to be that Democrats are increasingly united in their support for impeachment. Support among Democrats has risen from 73 percent a week ago to 90 percent in the survey released Monday. The CNN poll did not show a significant change among Democrats.\n\nAD\n\nDespite an apparent rise in impeachment support, the Quinnipiac poll shows no drop-off in Trump\u2019s job approval rating, which stands at 41 percent among registered voters, similar to his 40 percent rating a week ago. Trump\u2019s latest 53 percent disapproval mark is one of the lowest this year.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the CNN poll\u2019s finding of 47 percent in support of impeachment matches a previous high in CNN polling, from September 2018.\n\nOn a conference call with House Democrats on Sunday afternoon, one day before the release of the two latest surveys, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told her colleagues that public sentiment \u2014 something she had frequently cited as an obstacle to pursuing impeachment \u2014 had begun to swing around.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe polls have changed drastically about this,\u201d she said, urging a careful approach, according to notes taken by a person on the call. \u201cOur tone must be prayerful, respectful, solemn, worthy of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Friday through Sunday among a random national sample of 1,115 registered voters reached on cellphones and landlines. The margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. The previous Quinnipiac poll was conducted Sept. 19 to 23 among 1,337 voters and carried a 3.2-point error margin.\n\nThe CNN poll, meanwhile, was conducted among a random national sample of 1,009 adults reached Tuesday through Sunday on cellphones and landlines and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Both surveys found movement among political independents, a critical group that has thus far opposed impeachment.", "authors": ["Scott Clement", "Polling Director", "Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fbp-0wvuyk5-Ezr_31IdvM9DtQE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FVL7F5HBKMI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
