And it\u2019s going to take a while.\n\nThe \u201cStar Wars\u201d actor is currently filming the adventure documentary series \u201cLong Way Up\u201d with his friend Charley Boorman. The pair, who previously circumnavigated the globe on motorcycles in \u201cLong Way Round\u201d and rode across Africa in \u201cLong Way Down,\u201d have apparently undertaken the journey from the tip of South America to southern California for the latest installment, using vastly different bikes than before.\n\nAutoblog Argentina recently stumbled upon the production crew in Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fuego, and discovered that it is using all-electric Harley-Davidson Livewire motorcycles, customized for off-road use.\n\nThe $30,000 battery-powered bikes arent exactly a long-distance machine, with an urban range of 146 miles per charge -- under 100 miles on the highway. Nevertheless, they\u2019re not the only electric vehicles making the trip.\n\nThe team was also accompanied by prototypes for the upcoming Rivian R1T, a 4x4 electric pickup set to go into production next year with backing from Ford and Amazon and a range of more than 400 miles per charge.\n\nConsidering they have 10,000 miles or more to travel and not much of a charging infrastructure for much of the way, exactly how they\u2019re going to pull this off with electric vehicles is unknown.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA Harley-Davidson spokeswoman told Fox News Autos the company had no comment on the reports, while Rivian has not yet responded to a request for comment, but Boorman did say that there would be \"surprises\" and a \"twist\" on this trip, according to Motorcycle News.\n\nA date for the premiere of the series has not been announced.", "description": "Taking the long way to Los Angeles.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
