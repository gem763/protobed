He won the 1930s civil war and went on to rule Spain until 1975.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling, the court said it had decided to \"completely reject the appeal lodged by the family in relation to Francisco Franco's exhumation\".\n\nIn a tweet (in Spanish), Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez hailed the decision as a \"great victory for democracy\".\n\nMr Sanchez's deputy, Carmen Calvo, said the exhumation would be completed \"as soon as possible\". The government wants to carry it out before elections on 10 November.\n\nFranco currently lies in a huge mausoleum called the Valley of the Fallen, alongside tens of thousands of civil war dead.\n\nMany revile the complex - just outside Madrid - as a monument to the triumph of fascism, and it has become a shrine for the far right.\n\nThe government approved the exhumation in August.\n\nIt plans to put him next to his wife in El Pardo cemetery north of Madrid, where various other politicians are interred.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why Spain's government wants to exhume Gen Franco's remains\n\nMany descendents of Franco's victims support the move.\n\n\"The idea that people who were killed by Franco's troops are buried together with Franco, it's very absurd, and they're still glorifying him as if he was the saviour of Spain,\" Silvia Navarro, whose great uncle died in 1936, told the BBC.\n\nBut the family, who would rather he was not moved at all, wanted him to lie in a family crypt in the Almudena Cathedral - right in the centre of the capital.\n\nThe government argued that the former dictator should not be placed anywhere where he could be glorified. It also said there were potential security issues with the cathedral site.\n\nThe controversy comes at a time of political crisis in Spain, as the country prepares for its fourth general election in four years.\n\nPossible boost for the Socialists\n\nBy Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid\n\nThis was a resounding ruling in favour of the Spanish government, with the Supreme Court unanimously approving the exhumation.\n\nJust as noteworthy was the court's rejection of a claim by the Franco family that if the exhumation should go ahead, the remains should be reburied in a crypt beneath Almudena Cathedral in central Madrid.\n\nAlthough the family could now go to the Constitutional Court, many observers believe another appeal would not succeed. The government, which has seen its plan to exhume Franco repeatedly delayed, will now aim to carry it out as soon as possible.\n\nThere are some, relatively minor, hurdles still to overcome, such as securing the Catholic Church's co-operation, but if Franco's remains are moved by 10 November it would give the Socialists a boost in the general election to be held that day.\n\nWhat has been the reaction to the ruling?\n\nMr Sanchez said the government had always been guided by the determination to alleviate the suffering of Franco's victims.\n\n\"Today is a great victory of Spanish democracy,\" he said.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has endorsed the exhumation of Franco's remains and his transfer to El Pardo. Justice, memory and dignity.\"\n\nPablo Iglesias of the leftist Podemos party said the move was a \"very important step\" to remove a shame which had been present despite 40 years of democracy.\n\nBut Santiago Abascal, leader of the far-right Vox party, said he would oppose the Supreme Court decision \"because only Vox has the courage to defend freedom and common sense from totalitarianism and electoral propaganda tricks\".\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for the main opposition Popular Party said he did not intend to devote any time to the question.\n\n\"I have no opinion... I respect the procedures of the courts,\" Alfonso Serrano said, quoted by Efe news agency.\n\nHow has Spain dealt with the Franco era?\n\nUnlike in Mussolini's Italy and Nazi Germany, defeated in World War Two, Spain's transition to democracy in 1975 was more gradual.\n\nThough democracy is well established now, many believe the country has never faced up to its fascist past. There was an unwritten \"pact of forgetting\" during the transition.\n\nAn Amnesty Law adopted in 1977 prevents any criminal investigation into the Franco years.\n\nStatues of Franco were removed and many streets were renamed, to erase obvious signs of the fascist past.\n\nA Historical Memory Law, passed in 2007 by the socialist government at the time, recognised the war victims on both sides and provided some help for surviving victims of Franco's dictatorship and their families.\n\nBut the work to locate and rebury thousands of civil war dead has been slow and controversial.\n\nMore than 100,000 victims of the conflict, and the ferocious repression carried out afterwards, are still missing.\n\nWho was Francisco Franco?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images", "description": "Judges rule in favour of moving him from a state mausoleum to a less controversial site.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B9AC/production/_108923574_mediaitem108923573.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
