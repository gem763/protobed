Meghan McCain Rips Viewer Who Backs Pam Anderson In Assange Debate", "language": "en", "text": "Meghan McCain and former \u201cBaywatch\u201d star Pamela Anderson went head to head in a heated exchange over WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on \u201cThe View\u201d Friday.\n\nMcCain blasted Assange as a \u201ccyber terrorist\u201d while Anderson staunchly defended the man she has become close to. She instead attacked questionable actions by the American military that Assange exposed in 2010 in the first trove of classified information he released from former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.\n\n\u201cHe knows everything,\u201d Anderson said of Assange. \u201cHe\u2019s not stupid ... he\u2019s an interesting guy. He\u2019s obviously ruffled the feathers of some very powerful people, and powerful people want to keep him quiet.\u201d\n\nShe asked: \u201cYou know who put our national security at risk ... the military. How many people [has] the American government killed, innocently, and how many has WikiLeaks killed?\u201d\n\nWhen the audience applauded, an irritated McCain snapped at one member: \u201cOh, calm down, sir!\u201d\n\nJoy Behar suggested that Assange may have conspired with Russia to put Donald Trump in the White House. WikiLeaks released embarrassing Democratic Party emails before the presidential election \u2014 but never touched communications by the Republican Party.\n\nAnderson responded: \u201cHillary Clinton is responsible for Trump.\u201d\n\nCheck it out in the video above.", "description": "\"He\u2019s obviously ruffled the feathers of some very powerful people\" who \"want to keep him quiet,\" Anderson argued on \"The View.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7338103b0000956fd0c107.png?cache=saeyjun1hr&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
