Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a letter to colleagues last week. The hearing will not be public.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\n\u201cWe have to flesh out all of the facts for the American people. The seriousness of the matter and the danger to our country demands nothing less,\u201d Schiff wrote.\n\n\n\nAtkinson alerted Schiff and other congressional committee leaders to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint last month, but at the time, acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire would not allow Atkinson to share the full complaint with the committees.\n\nThe complaint, from an intelligence community employee, has since been released and alleges that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Democratic officials in what the whistleblower called a solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 elections. Biden is competing for the Democratic presidential nomination to run against Trump next year.\n\nAtkinson had reviewed the complaint and found that it was credible and met the statutory definition of an \u201curgent concern,\u201d which the law requires be shared with Congress.\n\nBut he was overruled by Maguire, who consulted with White House and Justice Department lawyers and determined that the complaint might be covered by executive privilege because it involved the president\u2019s communications with a foreign leader.\n\nThree committees, including Schiff\u2019s, are investigating the Trump administration\u2019s policy toward Ukraine and the role that his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, played in trying to get the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and his son.\n\nKurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, told House investigators on Thursday that he warned Giuliani that he was receiving untrustworthy information about the Bidens from Ukrainian political figures, according to two people familiar with his testimony.\n\nshane.harris@washpost.com", "description": "Michael Atkinson notified Congress about the whistleblower\u2019s claims but was blocked from sharing them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIgRUZ.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1615&y=502", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
