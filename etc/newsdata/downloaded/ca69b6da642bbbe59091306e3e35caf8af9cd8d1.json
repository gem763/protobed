Below is our annual list of ocean-going ships on order for major brands such as Royal Caribbean and Norwegian, updated to include two new vessels recently announced by industry giant Carnival.\n\nAs in the past, we only include ships from lines that market to North Americans, leaving out such operators as Germany-based Aida Cruises, which caters to the German-speaking market. We also have left off river cruise ships on order.\n\nFor the coming year, the big story in cruise-ship building is the development of new Princess and Norwegian vessels aimed at the Chinese market. Also notable is the arrival of the largest ships ever for MSC Cruises, Seabourn and Silversea (click through the carousel above for artist drawings of the vessels as well as others on order).\n\nAmong the most complex traveling machines built by man, ocean-going cruise ships take years to construct, so any new orders placed in the coming months likely won't be filled until 2020 at the earliest. We'll continue to update this page as new orders are announced.\n\n2016\n\nSeabourn Encore (Seabourn Cruise Line)\n\nPassengers: 604\n\nMaiden voyage: Dec. 4\n\nNotable: Seabourn's largest ship
