REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido\n\nThe IMF, whose fall meetings with the World Bank begin in Washington this week, also warned the main drivers of downside risks to the global economy remained ongoing trade tensions and policy uncertainty.\n\nA major geopolitical event, like Britain exiting the European Union without a new agreement in place, could trigger a sharp tightening of financial conditions, the IMF said in its bi-annual Global Financial Stability Report.\n\nThe IMF and other economic policymakers have expressed concern over high levels of risky corporate debt in the past. But the group said Wednesday that attempts by central banks worldwide to lower interest rates to combat immediate economic risks have exacerbated the situation, leading to \u201cworrisome\u201d levels of debt with poor credit quality and increasing financial vulnerabilities over the medium-term.\n\n\u201cWith rates staying lower for longer, financial conditions have eased, helping to address downside risks and support global growth for now,\u201d said IMF capital markets director Tobias Adrian. \u201cBut loose financial conditions have encouraged investors to take on more risk.\u201d\n\nThe IMF warned that 40% of all corporate debt in major economies could be considered \u201cat risk\u201d in another global downturn, exceeding levels seen during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\n\nInvestors may be \u201coverly complacent\u201d about downside risks this late in the economic cycle, the IMF cautioned. On Tuesday, the IMF cut its 2019 global growth projection to its lowest level since the financial crisis, largely due to ongoing trade feuds.\n\nThe IMF singled out rising risks in corporate and non-bank financial sectors as a source of concern. Investors, facing lower interest rates, are taking on more illiquid investments with weaker investor covenants in search of higher rates of return, it said.\n\n\u2018SEARCH FOR YIELD\u2019\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has cut rates twice this year amid concerns that slowing global growth and trade tensions could spill over to the broader economy. Meanwhile, central banks elsewhere, including the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, have kept interest rates in negative territory in a bid to spur lending.\n\n\u201cThe search for yield in a prolonged low interest rate environment has led to stretched valuations in risky asset markets around the globe, raising the possibility of sharp, sudden adjustments in financial conditions,\u201d the report said.\n\nSpecifically, the IMF said a global downturn half as severe as the one spurred by the last financial crisis would result in $19 trillion of corporate debt being considered \u201cat risk\u201d, which the IMF defines as debt from firms whose earnings would not cover the cost of their interest expenses.\n\nThe IMF also cautioned the low interest rate environment has driven up demand for debt in emerging and frontier economies, with external debt climbing to 160% of exports, compared with 100% in 2008. In a sharp downturn, it could become difficult to sustain or roll over those large debt obligations.\n\nTo guard against these risks, the IMF urged policymakers to maintain \u201crobust and rigorous\u201d financial regulation and supervision, and urged policymakers to activate broader macroprudential tools, such as countercyclical capital buffers. The IMF also said policymakers \u201curgently\u201d needed to develop better tools to monitor risks in the corporate sector.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund heightened its warnings for the corporate debt market on Wednesday, as investors search for richer returns in riskier assets after recent interest rate cuts by central banks.", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441501234&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F19Y", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
