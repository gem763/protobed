We now know that the same intelligence services who have been heroic in protecting us from those who want to attack our constitutional democracy from abroad are the same heroes who have stepped up to protect our constitutional democracy from within. Unlike you, they took seriously their oath to do both.\n\nAs for the future of the Middle East, let's not forget that ISIS was the Sunni Muslim jihadi organization that emerged after President Barack Obama's administration eliminated the previous holder of the worst-person-in-the-world title, Osama bin Laden. Al-Baghdadi's death \u2014 a very good thing in and of itself \u2014 is not the end of our troubles in and from the Middle East.\n\nTrump's effort to play down the significance of Obama's killing of bin Laden \u2014 while playing up his killing of al-Baghdadi as the key to creating the peace to end all peace \u2014 only shows how ignorant he is about the region.\n\nISIS emerged in 2014 as the product of three loose factions or movements.\n\nOne faction comprised the foreign volunteers. Some were hardened jihadis, but many were losers, misfits, adventure seekers and young men who had never held power, a job or a girl's hand, and they joined ISIS to get all three. ISIS offered a paycheck, power and sexual release to men and women coming from closed societies or cultures where none of that was available.\n\nISIS's second faction \u2014 its brains and military backbone \u2014 was composed of former Sunni Baathist army officers and local Iraqi Sunnis and tribes, who gave ISIS passive support. Iraqi Sunnis constitute about one-third of Iraq's population. They had ruled Iraq for generations, and many Sunnis in the Iraqi military were enraged, humiliated and frustrated by how the U.S. invasion of Iraq had overturned that order and put the Iraqi Shiite majority in charge.\n\nBut the U.S. keeps repeating the same mistake in the Middle East: overestimating the power of religious ideology and underappreciating the effect of bad governance.\n\nThe third ISIS faction was composed of the true religious ideologues, led by al-Baghdadi. They have their own apocalyptic version of Islam. But it would not have resonated so far and wide were it not for the first two factors listed above.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that leads us back to Trump and his foreign policy. Trump has never met a dictator he did not like. He is blind to the fact that the next al-Baghdadi is being incubated today in some prison in Egypt, where President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt, whom Trump once actually called \"my favorite dictator,'' is not only rounding up violent jihadis but liberal nonviolent journalists, activists and politicians.\n\nWhen Trump praises al-Baghdadi as his favorite victim and el-Sissi as his favorite dictator, all he is doing is walking in place. We're actually getting nowhere.\n\nAnd that brings me back to Syria. Syrian Sunnis supported ISIS for the same reason Iraqi Sunnis did. Iran, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia, the Shiite-Alawite Syrian regime of Bashar Assad and Russia have all collaborated to create a pro-Iranian Shiite minority government in Damascus, Syria. Of course they gave Trump a free pass to kill Baghdadi! His death just makes it that much easier for them to rule Syria without sharing power with the Sunnis. As long as that's the case, there will be no stability there.\n\nFinally, Trump kept going on and on in his news conference about how he, in his infinite wisdom, was keeping U.S. troops in Syria to protect the oil fields there so maybe U.S. oil companies could exploit them. He even boasted that while he was against the Iraq War, we should have taken over all of Iraq's oil fields to pay for it.\n\nThis is disgusting talk, and again, a prescription for trouble in the future. If America has any role in the Middle East today, it is not to protect the oil wells but to protect and enhance what I call the \"islands of decency.\"\n\nThese are places like Iraqi and Syrian Kurdistan, Jordan, the UAE, Oman, Lebanon and the frail democracies in Tunisia and Baghdad. None of these are developed democracies; Oman, Jordan and the UAE are monarchies. But perfect is not on the menu in the Middle East right now. And these countries do promote more moderate versions of Islam and religious tolerance, they do empower their women, and they do encourage modern education.\n\nBut the U.S. keeps repeating the same mistake in the Middle East: overestimating the power of religious ideology and underappreciating the effect of bad governance.\n\nOnly Trump would boast of defeating ISIS and thinking that all that needs to be done now is to protect the Middle East's oil wells and America's favorite dictators \u2014 and not its wells of decenc\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The US keeps on over-estimating the power of religious ideology and under-estimating the importance of good governance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1697%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/704738b896685a30a91cc944366e05978be716c8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
