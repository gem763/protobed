She is a law professor and presumably has a passing familiarity with the text of the Constitution. Yet, earlier this month she tweeted the following: \u201cOn my first day as president, I will sign an executive order that puts a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands. And I will ban fracking \u2014 everywhere.\u201d The president doesn\u2019t possess the power to ban fracking with the stroke of the pen. This would quite literally overturn an act of Congress. Nonetheless, she tells us, \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan to make sure that no President is above the law.\u201d\n\nAs a candidate, she is also above telling the truth about how she will pay for grandiose boondoggles like \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Tuesday night she appeared on the Stephen Colbert show, and he was presumptuous enough to ask where the all money was going to come from to pay for Medicare for All. She began yammering about her proposed \u201cwealth tax,\u201d which would impose a 2-percent annual tax on fortunes above $50 million and a 3-percent annual tax on those above $1 billion. This is very likely unconstitutional, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t pay for M4A. Colbert asked her several times if she would raise taxes on the middle class. She simply refused to answer the question.\n\nObviously, if she wins the Democratic presidential nomination, President Trump isn\u2019t going to be as gentle as Colbert.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Catron", "Spectator.Org Why-Trump-Will-Trounce-Biden-Or-Warren"], "top_image": ""}
