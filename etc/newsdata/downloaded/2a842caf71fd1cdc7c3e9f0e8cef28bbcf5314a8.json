We are focussing exclusively on things that don't provoke disagreements but that, on the contrary, unite people.\"\n\nThe group, which organised an all-singing, all-dancing Russian fair in Lyon, insists that it has no funding from Russian authorities.\n\nHowever experts say that Moscow is well aware that cultural clout does count.\n\nSpeaking of the diaspora, analyst Michail Suslov from Copenhagen University said: \"The Kremlin is tryng and has always tried to use this resource.\"\n\nHe said there are \"millions of people who can potentially be promoters of soft power,\" but added that \"the Kremlin's influence is certainly focussed on the former post-Soviet space\".\n\nIn other words, the West need not fear a hidden agenda in events like cultural fairs.\n\nNonetheless, opinions are firm.\n\n\"It is very important for us to preserve Russian langauage and culture,\" said Olga, a mother who has lived in France for 10 years..\n\n\"You know I am...such a patriot!\n\n\"I could say I am focussing more on the Russian-side,\" Olga said, adding that she would try to explain \"the Russian position,\" to her young son, in order \"to support it\".\n\nPatriotism aside, it seems there is no need to make a song and dance about Russian soft power, in the cultural realm at least.", "description": "At a time when the Kremlin is caught up in worldwide controversy, Russians abroad are pulling together to celebrate their cultural heritage", "authors": ["Lesley Alexander"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/12/74/56/1000x563_cmsv2_863517ff-f886-575a-bf7c-acf423c40fb0-3127456.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-13"}
