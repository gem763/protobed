(Sept. 13) AP, AP\n\nWhen 10 presidential candidates finished three hours of debating Thursday \u2014 covering weighty topics like gun control and health care \u2014 the biggest social media topics were Joe Biden\u2019s teeth.\n\nAnd an insult he may have suffered.\n\nThe insult came courtesy of Julian Castro, once the youngest member of Barrack Obama\u2019s cabinet, who, in a heated exchange, yelled at Biden, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nThe crowd gasped. Pundits tweeted. The question was perceived as a whack at Biden\u2019s age, which, at 76, exceeds Castro\u2019s by 32 years.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates former Vice President Joe Biden, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Andrew Yang talk Thursday, Sept. 12, 2019, after a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by ABC at Texas Southern University in Houston.

Well, as Biden started to answer a question about the NRA, he appeared to have an issue with his mouth, which led the internet to speculate on whether his teeth were about to \u201cfall out.\u201d\n\nNow, whether that gaffe was denture related, or whether Castro meant to poke at Biden\u2019s memory (Castro insists he didn\u2019t), there's a larger issue here. It's about age, perceived age, and judging someone by age.\n\nWhich is a much bigger problem in America than a couple of political debate moments.\n\n'Young people are just smarter'\n\nWhen Castro, whose resume mainly consists of three years as U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and five years as the mayor of San Antonio, seemed to mock the mental capacity of Biden, a longtime senator and two-term vice president, it no doubt resonated with older viewers.\n\nYoung people assuming their older counterparts can\u2019t keep up. Young candidates presuming they are better suited, despite less experience. Young workers being promoted as older workers are dismissed. This type of thing happens every day in American society, where, by next year, it is projected that 17% of our population will be over 65.\n\nSeventeen percent. That\u2019s a good deal larger than our African-American or Asian populations, and nearly the same size as the entire Hispanic population.\n\nYet the issue of age discrimination is only whispered about, as if part of that stupid assumption that older people can\u2019t hear. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s insulting. If you deride, don\u2019t hire, or dismiss people based on their age, it\u2019s a prejudice. Yet it doesn\u2019t seem to invoke the anger that other biases do.\n\nWhy? Well, let\u2019s face it. We live in a society that worships youth. Our entertainment chases teenage viewers (just count the comic-book movies). Advertisers have little interest in people over 50. Products to remove wrinkles or grey hair fly off the shelves. \u201cThe youngest to ever\u201d is a coveted title in work, politics, and law, while \u201cthe oldest to ever\u201d is usually reserved for human-interest stories, like an 80-year-old marathoner, or the 74-year-old Indian woman who recently gave birth to twins.\n\nMeanwhile, there's the increasing trend to lay off workers in their 50s \u2014 which is not exactly old in a world where life expectancies have increased to well beyond 80 \u2014 and not absorb those fired workers back into the workplace.\n\nThis should be a big issue for any presidential candidate. But do you ever hear it brought up? Virtually every form of discrimination is hashed and rehashed on the campaign trail. Yet with more than a third of our population over 50 \u2014 a third! \u2014 nobody seems to make this a topic.\n\nA recent AARP study showed that nearly two out of three workers 45 and older have experienced age discrimination on the job. Another study of 2,000 workers over 50 showed that more than half were forced to leave their jobs at some point due to \"layoffs, businesses closing, job dissatisfaction or unexpected retirement.\" Of these, only 10% found another job of equal pay or rank.\n\nIt seems like everyone can tell you of a former executive or high-level salesman who is now scrambling to find any kind of career, or driving for Uber to pay the bills.\n\nAmerica used to be a country where the longer you worked the more respected you were. We are becoming the opposite.\n\n\u201cYoung people are just smarter,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, once said.\n\nAnd now Facebook is considered, by many, to be kind of old.\n\nAging in an ageist world\n\nSo when a Julian Castro, used to being celebrated as \u201cthe youngest to,\u201d takes an apparent jab at an older man\u2019s memory, or the internet pokes fun at the old guy losing his dentures \u2014 or Biden\u2019s reference to \u201ca record player\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s more than just a tweet. It\u2019s all a subtle form of ageism that has crept into our culture, despite the very aging of that culture.\n\nIt\u2019s the reason older people today go to such great efforts to hide their years. Age once meant venerability. Gravitas. These days it\u2019s more about Botox, hair plugs and face lifts (all things, coincidentally, that Joe Biden has been rumored to have done).\n\nPeople say they need to worry about the age of a president. What if he loses his capacities on the job? What if he dies in office? But it\u2019s worth noting the infrequency of such things. Since the 20th century, only two presidents died in office who were not assassinated. Warren Harding died of a heart attack when he was 57. Franklin Roosevelt died of a massive stroke when he was 63.\n\nOld age wasn\u2019t the culprit. Today we have a cheeseburger-loving 73-year-old president, Donald Trump, who calls Biden, only three years older, \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d and 78-year-old Bernie Sanders, \u201cCrazy Bernie.\u201d\n\nSo ageism can come from senior citizens as well. It\u2019s built into our culture. For the life of me, I don\u2019t know why this isn\u2019t a bigger issue \u2014 among candidates and society in general \u2014 considering the enormous attention we give to other forms of discrimination.\n\nAfter all, we will never be a single race or gender.\n\nBut all of us, if we\u2019re lucky, will one day be old.\n\nEven Julian Castro.\n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com.
