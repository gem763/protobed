Didn't like the clothes she was wearing. Too short, too revealing. That I was a crap parent, encouraging Meg to go out on Saturday night, the only reason Meg was going out was for sex.'\n\nHe continued: 'She ranted at me for being a bad parent, calling me f****** useless. Called me limp and useless. Bit embarrassing - we have been having, I have been having, erectile dysfunction. I was not performing very well.\n\n'Marie was at this point raging, absolutely raging, finger pointing, screaming. She then slapped me across the face.'\n\nMr Pratt said: 'Then what happened?'\n\nPomphret replied: 'Er, I remember reaching out, grabbing her hood and... I don't remember.'\n\nOn November 2, Pomphret rang 999 claiming to have found his wife lying in a pool of blood at the stables in Warrington, Cheshire\n\nMr Pratt asked: 'What's the next thing you remember?'\n\nPomphret said: 'I was standing at the side of her body. There was blood on my hands and the crowbar. She was on the floor.'\n\nThe accused told the jury he had no recollection of attacking his wife with the crowbar.\n\nGiving evidence from the witness box on the sixth day of his trial, Richard Pratt QC, defending, asked him: 'You accept, on the second of November last year, you battered your wife to death. How do you feel?'\n\nPomphret said: 'Er, terrible. I killed the woman I love. A horrible thing to do.'\n\nHe said he then panicked and 'stupidly' decided to try to cover his tracks, burning his bloodied clothes and throwing the crowbar in a pond before returning home.\n\nThe couple met on Mrs Pomphret's 21st birthday and were 'happily married' with one daughter, Megan, 18, but, over the course of their 22-year marriage, his wife's physical and mental health deteriorated, the jury heard.\n\nPomphret, a technology expert with Barclays, struck her head more than 30 times at the stables (pictured) they owned near the home they shared with their daughter Megan\n\nPomphret said his wife could go from being happy to depressed 'in minutes' and become 'very angry, very quickly'.\n\nThe defendant said he and their daughter developed 'coping mechanisms', removing themselves, or his wife, from a situation and deciding to 'let her rant.'\n\nOn Monday's sitting, Carol Buckley, the victim's mother, said in a statement read to the jury: 'David was an angel. He deserved a medal for putting up with Marie.\n\n'I could not have wished for a better son-in-law or dad for Megan.'\n\nMs Buckley said her daughter married the defendant in 1997 and they shared an interest in horses, describing her daughter as the 'driving force' in the relationship.\n\nShe also said her daughter could easily 'take the huff', blocking her on Facebook over something she had said.\n\nKenneth Crane, Ms Buckley's partner, said in a statement: 'Marie, I would describe as a Jekyll and Hyde character.\n\n'She was like a volcano. She could erupt at any time without warning. I would describe David as a very quiet bloke. He would never talk or chat.'\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "David Pomphret, a tech expert with Barclays bank, bludgeoned his wife Marie more than 30 times at the stables they owned near their home in Winwick, Warrington after she hit him and mocked his penis.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali", "Alexander Robertson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/18/19407126-0-image-a-7_1570469817824.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
