We had a bit of a plan around the different pictures we wanted to produce. Reece (being) unavailable made us have to make another change.\n\n\u201cWe know that Wales are a very strong team. We\u2019re going to have to be on for 80 (minutes) to have success against them. We\u2019ve picked a team we think will do that.\u201d\n\nNic White and Christian Leali\u2019ifano came into the tournament as the incumbent halfback pairing after firing Australia to a thumping victory over New Zealand in Perth and both started the opening victory against Fiji last weekend.\n\nGenia made a big difference when he came off the bench to replace White in Sapporo, however, while Leali\u2019ifano took a battering from the Fijians as Australia came from behind to win.\n\nThere is bound to be concern in Australia that Cheika has picked a team to nullify the threat posed by Wales rather than to impose, but he insisted the changes had been long planned.\n\n\u201cNot form decisions at all. It\u2019s a different group of players and I\u2019ve spoken to the players about that. They know what their jobs are, with their piece of the puzzle throughout the World Cup,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAnd as much as they want to play - well, Kurtley is playing, he\u2019s going to have a role in it - they understand exactly where we\u2019re at and they\u2019ve got their roles to fill.\u201d\n\nFoley had enjoyed an almost unbroken run in the side for five years until he was dropped for Leali\u2019ifano this season and Cheika said he was sure the 30-year-old would take his opportunity.\n\n\u201cI obviously believe in him a lot. I\u2019ve got a lot of history with him, and I think that he\u2019s trying to fight against the challenge that Christian\u2019s brought to him, and Matty Toomua as well,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAt the World Cup you\u2019re not given anything, you\u2019ve got to take everything. Here\u2019s an opportunity, go and take it. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s in that mindset as well.\u201d\n\nTeam: 15-Dane Haylett-Petty, 14-Adam Ashley-Cooper, 13-James O\u2019Connor, 12-Samu Kerevi, 11-Marika Koroibete, 10-Bernard Foley, 9-Will Genia, 8-Isi Naisarani, 7-Michael Hooper (captain), 6-David Pocock, 5-Rory Arnold, 4-Izack Rodda, 3-Allan Alaalatoa, 2-Tolu Latu, 1-Scott Sio.\n\nReplacements: 16-Jordan Uelese, 17-James Slipper, 18-Sekope Kepu, 19-Adam Coleman, 20-Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, 21-Nic White, 22-Matt Toomua, 23-Kurtley Beale.", "description": "Australia coach Michael Cheika dropped a few selection bombshells on Friday when he brought scrumhalf Will Genia and flyhalf Bernard Foley into his team for Sunday's blockbuster Rugby World Cup Pool D clash against Wales.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434458031&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0IB-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
