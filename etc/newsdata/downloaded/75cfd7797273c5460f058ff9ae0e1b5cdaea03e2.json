trade deals and deregulation.\n\n\u201cAnd the US has made clear, since 2016, that its priority will be access for US agricultural goods produced to lower standards, as well as access for genetically modified goods.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email

She did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nThe controversy comes after a leaked document revealed the government is already exploring how the Brexit deal will allow it to slash standards in future.\n\nThe trade bill is one of no fewer than seven pieces of Brexit legislation now \u201cpaused\u201d unless Jeremy Corbyn drops his opposition to Mr Johnson\u2019s demand for a general election on 12 December.\n\nThe defeats were inflicted in the Lords in March, but the legislation was then put on ice rather than before MPs \u2013 before disappearing altogether when the session was curtailed.\n\nUntil it passes, the UK cannot trade on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules after a no-deal Brexit, which the prime minister insists remains a possibility.\n\nMr Johnson and Mr Trump talked up prospects for a rapid trade agreement when they met in New York last month, the US president hailing its \u201cmagnificent\u201d potential.\n\nThe prime minister has insisted the NHS will be \u201coff the table\u201d and that he will not \u201cprejudice or jeopardise our standards on animal welfare and food hygiene\u201d.\n\nHowever, Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, is among those arguing there will be no US trade deal unless the UK weakens its red lines \u2013 meaning No 10 will be under huge pressure from home and abroad to back down.\n\nThe key protections added to the previous bill in the Lords were:\n\n* A negotiating mandate must be approved by parliament for any trade deal, plus an impact assessment drawn up by a parliamentary committee.\n\n* Any agreement must be approved by the committee, with recommendations reviewed by both Commons and Lords.\n\n* No agreement can be ratified unless it has been approved by both Commons and Lords.\n\nBut the Department for International Trade defended its decision to start afresh on the grounds that the bill was not intended to \u201cdeal with future free trade agreements\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have been clear that we will maintain our high standards including on environmental standards as we leave the EU and negotiate new trade deals around the world,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe work of the House of Lords will be taken into account when preparing new legislation to we provide continuity for both businesses and consumers that trade across the globe. This will of course be subject to scrutiny in both houses.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson is paving the way for a quickfire\u00a0US trade deal after Brexit that would slash UK food standards by stripping out protections imposed by parliament earlier this year, critics are warning.", "authors": ["Rob Merrick"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/04/12/237346346346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
