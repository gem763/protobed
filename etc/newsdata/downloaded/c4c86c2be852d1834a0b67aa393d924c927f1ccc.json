No matter how much he campaigned, \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter. I had the \u2018R\u2019 next to my name,\u201d said Mr. Millar, whose district was partly in Gwinnett.\n\nHot-button issues, including President Trump\u2019s calls to limit immigration and a GOP-backed state abortion law, are driving people of color and women in suburban Atlanta to the Democrats, Mr. Millar said.\n\nThe county\u2019s shift from predominantly white and Republican to Democratic-leaning and diverse is part of a national trend that includes California\u2019s Orange County and two less populous Atlanta suburban counties, Cobb and Henry, said Andra Gillespie, an Emory University political-science professor. Minorities and immigrants are moving in large numbers to suburban areas where rents are often cheaper, she said.\n\n\u201cGwinnett is on the front line,\u201d she said.\n\nThose growing areas\u2014blue dots in what had been a sea of red\u2014are playing a larger role in elections across the South, including Georgia.\n\nGwinnett, northeast of downtown Atlanta, is a web of subdivisions, apartment complexes, shopping centers and single-family houses typical of the sprawling metro region. It is home to Atlanta commuters and those working across the northern suburbs, from executives to service workers.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s dominance in the county started to unravel in 2016 when an influx of minorities and immigrants delivered a surprise: Democrat Hillary Clinton won Gwinnett by 51% to 45% for Donald Trump, even as Mrs. Clinton lost the state. In 2018, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams carried Gwinnett by a wide margin as she narrowly lost her bid to Republican Brian Kemp. Several Democrats down-ticket in the county won, knocking out Republicans who had held office for decades.\n\nGeorgians waiting in line to cast their votes in the 2018 U.S. midterm election at a Gwinnett County polling place in Snellville, Ga.

Voter-registration data from the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office show how crucial Gwinnett, with 927,000 people and growing, could be in 2020. In July 2019, Gwinnett had more than 549,000 registered voters, a 40% increase from July 2016. In 2019, about 44% of Gwinnett\u2019s registered voters were black, Hispanic or Asian, up from about 37% three years earlier.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think Republicans can continue to appeal to the residents of Gwinnett County? Join the conversation below.\n\nMs. Abrams, who heads a group called Fair Fight Action pressing for changes in how votes are cast and counted, has made it clear Gwinnett will be a focus. When she announced a national campaign on vote counting in August, her first public event in Georgia was at a Gwinnett elementary school where voting machines malfunctioned in 2018.\n\nBoth parties see Atlanta\u2019s swelling suburbs as pivotal in 2020, not just for the presidential contest, but for the state\u2019s two Senate seats, both of which will be up for grabs. GOP Sen. David Perdue, a vocal Trump supporter, is up for re-election. GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson, 74 years old, who has Parkinson\u2019s disease, announced in August that he will retire at the end of this year. Gov. Kemp will appoint someone to temporarily fill the post and then hold a special election for the last two years of Mr. Isakson\u2019s term in November 2020.\n\nBianca Keaton, a former Abrams campaign staffer who now is the first woman to chair the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, said candidates and volunteers are clamoring to work on Democratic campaigns in her county.\n\n\u201cCountywide, it\u2019s not a good time to be a Republican,\u201d said Ms. Keaton, 36, who is African-American.\n\nMs. Keaton is the first woman to chair the Gwinnett County Democratic Party.

Democrats are confident they can win the remaining three next year, Ms. Keaton said.\n\nJulianne Thompson, a Gwinnett-based Republican strategist who serves on the national advisory board of Women for Trump 2020, said her party was caught off guard in Gwinnett during recent elections, but it will campaign aggressively in 2020, targeting conservative voters to make sure they get to the polls.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party has learned a lot of lessons, including about get-out-the-vote efforts in rapidly changing communities like Gwinnett County,\u201d she said.\n\nCharlotte Nash, the Republican county commission chairwoman, declined to comment. Danny Porter, the longtime Republican county prosecutor, told the Gwinnett Daily Post this year that he might switch to be a Democrat in the 2020 race to ensure a win. He didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nIn 2016, whites made up just over half of the registered voters in Gwinnett, according to secretary of state data. This year they make up just under 42%.\n\nThe county now is home to a large Korean population, one of the largest Hindu temples in North America and numerous other immigrant communities, from Dominicans to Chinese. It is also poorer. In 2017, 12.3% of the county lived in poverty, according to the census. In 2000, 5.7% of residents lived in poverty.\n\nDowntown Lithonia in Gwinnett County.

Netflix rented a portion of the mall to film its series \u201cStranger Things.\u201d Indian-American developers have proposed tearing the mall down and replacing it with a cricket stadium.\n\nShayla Walker, 42, an African-American who has lived in the county for 19 years, said Republicans haven\u2019t been listening to the needs of minority voters and are paying the price at the polls.\n\n\u201cYou have to give people some incentive to keep voting for you,\u201d she said.\n\nDwayne Menser, 59, a white retired finance executive, visited the mall recently with his family to see the \u201cStranger Things\u201d set. Mr. Menser, a longtime Gwinnett resident who described himself as \u201ca very conservative Republican,\u201d said he has noticed political tensions rising among neighbors in recent years.\n\n\u201cBoth sides have to find a way to ratchet down the rhetoric,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.com", "description": "Gwinnett County in Atlanta\u2019s suburbs has been a Republican stronghold since Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election, but an influx of minorities has created a possible Democratic juggernaut for 2020.", "authors": ["Cameron Mcwhirter", "Cameron.Mcwhirter Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109659/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
