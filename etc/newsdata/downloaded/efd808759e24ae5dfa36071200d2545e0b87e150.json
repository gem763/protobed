He also carried a navy blue windbreaker over his arm as they walked through the parking lot of Cora's Coffee Shoppe, which is just a stone's throw from Santa Monica Pier.\n\nSpecs appeal: Lauren appeared to go makeup-free for the early morning jaunt, accessorizing with some glasses, and a pair of diamond earrings\n\nTalk to the hand!
