Mr Trump took a hit at his predecessor Barack Obama for not leaving Syria after what was supposed to be a short period, and slammed political pundits who he said were calling for \u201cyet another American military intervention\u201d.\n\nGetting American troops out of costly wars in the Middle East has long been a promise of Mr Trump, but his latest decisions in Syria and other countries in the region may not be achieving much of that promise. Although the president withdrew a small number of troops from northern Syria, he is still planning to keep a military presence in that same region to \u201csecure\u201d the oil fields in the border area.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Ultimately, American military presence in the Middle East is not really decreasing, and experts argue that there are many chances for the US to get entangled in further conflict in the region.\n\nPouya Alimagham, a historian of the Middle East at MIT, says that Mr Trump\u2019s framing of the troop withdrawal from Syria is far from reality. \u201cSyria was never our war while Afghanistan was, and the Afghan war continues unabated. Furthermore, we have maintained our bases across the Middle East, and have increased our troop presence in Saudi Arabia\u201d he added.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Critics however see the sudden US withdrawal as a \u201cgreen light\u201d to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to move across the border and invade northern Syria. \u201cIn fact, it is a rare occasion for a US ally in the Middle East to commence a military operation without a US green light,\u201d Mr Alimagham said.\n\nThe alliance with Turkey, a member of NATO, has long been important to Washington and the Trump administration does not want to jeopardise the relationship. On the other hand, Kurdish fighters in Syria seem to be considered a disposable ally by the White House and are being treated as such. While the current situation in northern Syria has developed into a tragedy for Syrian Kurds, President Trump continues to stand by his sudden decisions and the subsequent events that have followed.\n\nAnother critical issue in Syria is the possibility of the re-emergence of Isis in one form or the other. Thousands of men, women and children have been in prisons and detention camps in northern Syria, run by Kurdish forces.\n\nMr Trump criticised European governments in his statement, for not having taken responsibility in the ensuing situation and urged them to take European members of Isis back to their countries for trial. While the caliphate has lost all of its territory and thousands of its fighters continue to be detained, there is growing fear that the chaos on the Turkish-Syria border would end up with dangerous ramifications.", "description": "President Trump defended his decision to withdraw troops from Northern Syria\u00a0in a statement from the White House, and reiterated his plan to get American troops out of \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Negar Mortazavi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/21/trump-syria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
