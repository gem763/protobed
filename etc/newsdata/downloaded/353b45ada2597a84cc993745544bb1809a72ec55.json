But two years after it started, the infrastructure bank has completed nothing.\"\n\nThe bank has so far committed $2 billion to a Go Train expansion in Ontario, $55 million to a high-speed rail project between Toronto and Quebec City, $128 million to expanding light rail in Montr\u00e9al and $20 million for the Mapleton Water and Wastewater facilities in Ontario.\n\nThe agency also has signed a number of agreements for other projects and in some cases is providing advisory services for infrastructure proposals.\n\nScheer also announced that, if elected, he would revamp the way infrastructure projects across Canada are prioritized. Projects that reduce congestion and result in faster commute times would be pushed to the top of the queue, he said.\n\n\"These are the kinds of projects that make a difference in people's lives by reducing gridlock and speeding up commute times,\" said Scheer.\n\nThe Conservative leader pitched the move as one that would allow families to spend more time with their loved ones and less time travelling. Examples of projects that would be approved under this police include:\n\nThe George Massey Tunnel Replacement Project in Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe Ontario Line Yonge Subway Extension in Toronto, Ont.\n\nThe third link across the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec City.\n\nUnlike the leaders of the Liberal, NDP and Green parties, Scheer chose not to attend any of today's climate change action protests across the country. Reporters asked him if announcing a measure to help reduce traffic congestion was tone-deaf in the circumstances.\n\nPeople hold signs depicting Ontario Premier Doug Ford, federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and U.S. President Donald Trump as they march in Ottawa as part of a Global Climate Strike Friday. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press)\n\nScheer said he's encouraged to see so many young people engaged with an issue they care about.\n\n\"I'm here making an announcement today that will lower commute times, which means people will be stuck in traffic less, which means a reduction of emissions,\" Scheer said describing the move as \"real concrete action\" that would lower emissions.\n\nThe Liberal Party responded to the announcement by saying that the Conservatives were \"cherry-picking projects.\"\n\n\"Scheer's infrastructure proposal is nothing short of a rollback of our commitment to building stronger communities,\" the Liberal statement said. \"Conservative cuts hurt, and it is Canadian families and communities who will be affected by Scheer's five-year cuts plan.\"", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said today a government led by him would bring transparency back to federal infrastructure spending by scrapping the Canada Infrastructure Bank.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5300868.1569617981!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/andrew-scheer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
