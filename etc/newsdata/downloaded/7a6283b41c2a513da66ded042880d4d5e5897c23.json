But over the past week, I\u2019ve begun to realise that the crackpot in the White House has much more in common with ancient Rome.\n\nMy former classics professor once told me \u2013 when I melodramatically called him on my mobile phone from the original Roman forum during the US occupation of Iraq under George W. Bush \u2013 that the Romans were a \u201cmanic\u201d people, but that they would have been pretty unimpressed with the American handling of the Iraqi campaign.\n\nHe was right. But I am now convinced that there is something distinctly \u201cmanic\u201d about the Trump presidency. The hatred, the threats, the fury, have much in common with both the Roman Republic (Rome\u2019s version of popular \u201cdemocracy\u201d) and the Roman Empire, when quite a number of emperors showed themselves to be just as insane as Trump.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Is this not exactly the language of Trump? Did he not say that he could have Afghanistan \u201cwiped off the face of the earth\u201d, that he could \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea, that Iran \u201cwill be destroyed\u201d if it attacks the US?\n\nCato got what he wanted. Carthage was indeed razed, its people sold into slavery, although its lands were not in fact sown with salt as English historians would later claim. So far, Trump has been more Cicero than Cato, Pompeo more Pliny than Pompey. So far.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The Goths, Ostrogoths and Visigoths did not just gobble up Italy over a weekend. The fall of the empire came slowly, over years, in small incremental pieces: legions forgotten, tribal allies unpaid \u2013 and then betrayed.\n\nOne of Rome\u2019s most troublesome provinces was Cilicia. It was always changing hands. Its people allied themselves to Rome \u2013 and were then abandoned when legions left or taxes ran out. Cilicia, by extraordinary mischance, lay almost exactly along the western border of what is today the Turkish-Syrian (Kurdish) frontier.\n\nThere are still a few Roman ruins in that ancient province to remind its present-day armies of what \u2013 they should have surely realised \u2013 would be their fate. I doubt if there is a single US soldier in Syria \u2013 who must, of course, negotiate their own way out of that equally ancient country \u2013 who knows of this. Institutional memory, let alone historical memory, has long ago been erased by the internet.\n\nThe Roman Empire fell in bits. The senators, living in the political wreckage of the old Roman Republic, knew that something was going wrong. The people understood their demise only in stages. The great Roman roads went unrepaired. The legions could not move so fast (even if they were still loyal to Rome). Then the imperial mail service from north Africa was impaired, even halted. The wheat for bread \u2013 often from what is today the Bekaa valley in eastern Lebanon \u2013 failed to arrive in Rome.\n\nAmid popular unrest in Rome, where rival leaders could and did physically threaten each other, these matters often went unnoticed. Impeachment, alas, was not an option in the ancient world.\n\nBut the sword (or poison) could do its work. Political enemies would be accused of treachery. \u201cCrucify them!\u201d But is that not what Trump says of the American press, the Democrats or anyone who dares to confront him with his abominable lies and his assaults on American democracy?\n\nNo, I am not suggesting that the American Empire will leave us quite like this. But last week\u2019s deplorable abandonment of the Kurds, Trump\u2019s wickedness in allowing the Turks \u2013 and their wretched \u201cArab\u201d allies \u2013 to slaughter their way into northern Syria, will have the same effect as it did in antiquity. If you can no longer trust Rome, to which other empire do you turn?\n\nWell, Putin\u2019s, of course. Tyrant he may be \u2013 but at least he\u2019s sane. And his legions stayed out of the war in Syria and saved the Assad regime. They cleared the highways of Isis mines \u2013 they restored the roads, sometimes (incredibly) what were once Roman roads \u2013 and they learned Arabic. Perhaps, indeed, Putin now plays the role of the later Roman Empire of the East, the Christian one which survived in Constantinople/Byzantium/Istanbul for hundreds more years after the fall of Rome itself. All the Middle East is now his empire, every capital welcoming the emperor: Tehran, Cairo, Ankara, Damascus, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, I was in Washington, seeking to find the missile-maker who manufactured the rocket which Israel fired into a civilian ambulance in southern Lebanon, killing all inside. And I was much struck at how Roman Washington looked. Its great palaces of state (save for the State Department itself, of course) were self-consciously modelled on Roman architecture.\n\nWashington was not built as the capital of a physical empire \u2013 more a philosophical one, I suspect, in my kinder moments \u2013 but it looks (like Vienna, Berlin, Paris, London) as if the early Americans of the independence era realised it might one day be the capital of the most powerful nation on earth. Well, it was.\n\nBut Trump has changed all that. To the despair of his few friends (of the non-\u201dmanic\u201d kind) and the delight of his enemies, he has laid America low. The Syrians, whose history goes back far longer than America\u2019s have played their old political policy again: Wait. And wait. And wait. And then drive into Manbij the moment the Americans leave. That\u2019s what Rome\u2019s enemies did when the empire\u2019s frontiers crumbled in Germania and then in Gaul and then in the Balkans \u2013 of all places \u2013 and then in Palmyra and in what is today Syria.\n\nAs for Washington\u2019s noble architecture, it now takes its place alongside the old capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire, where the fine Viennese buildings of state seem shamed by their majesty. The powerful and historical walls to study today are those of the Kremlin.", "description": "In days gone by, I used to compare the Trump presidency with the Arab dictatorships.
