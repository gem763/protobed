The one frame Gilbert won he scored a century. It was tough stuff.\u2019\n\nThe Rocket was right in his analysis, the Angry Farmer was 5-0 behind before he rolled in a break of 101, in what turned out to be his only frame of the match.\n\nSelby was thrilled with his performance and to get back to winning ways after a run of form that he was struggling to deal with.\n\nThe Jester from Leicester said after his first round win in Crawley on Monday: \u2018I won five tournaments one year, then anything less than that it seems like a failure which is obviously not the case because it\u2019s tough to win any tournament nowadays.\n\n\u2018Even if I was to lose in the final and it\u2019s still not good enough because of what I\u2019ve achieved in the game and when you\u2019ve set your standards so high. Until I win another tournament my confidence probably won\u2019t come back.\u2019\n\nNow it seems that his confidence will return, as he says he could not have asked for more from his week at the K2 Leisure Centre.\n\n\u2018Especially in a final,\u2019 said Selby. \u2018In any match if you play like that it\u2019s a good performance, but in a final against a class player like Dave, I can\u2019t really ask for much more than that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelby and O\u2019Sullivan will be back in action at the World Open in Yushan later this month.\n\nMORE: Mark Selby annihilates David Gilbert in English Open final to claim first title in over a year\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan stunned by Mei Xiwen and Tom Ford hits 147 on dramatic English Open night", "description": "Ronnie O'Sullivan believes Mark Selby might have already produced the best performance of the entire season in his 9-1 demolition of David Gilbert in the English Open final.
