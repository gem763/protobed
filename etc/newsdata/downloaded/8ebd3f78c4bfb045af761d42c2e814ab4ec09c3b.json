The HDP denies such links.\n\nWhile most of Turkey\u2019s opposition parties have backed the operation, the HDP has called for it to stop, describing it as an \u201cinvasion attempt\u201d. HDP says the operation was an attempt by the government to drum up support amid declining public backing.\n\nThe HDP said 151 of its members, including district officials, had been detained over the past week since Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies launched the assault.\n\nLast week, Turkish police launched criminal investigations into the HDP\u2019s co-chairs over their criticism of the military operation and started probes into more than 500 social accounts over \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d criticizing the offensive.\n\nAuthorities launched similar investigations after each of Turkey\u2019s two previous cross-border operations into Syria. More than 300 people were detained for social media posts criticizing Turkey\u2019s offensive into northern Syria in January 2018.", "description": "Turkish police detained four mayors from a pro-Kurdish party in dawn raids, widening a crackdown since Ankara launched an incursion into northern Syria a week ago, state media and the party said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
