He declined to provide names of the companies because they signed nondisclosures.\n\nCity officials maintain that the flock of businesses moving to Tennessee was years in the making, part of a campaign to position the city as the new (and more affordable) Austin or Denver.\n\nBut Tennessee Economic and Community Development Commissioner Bob Rolfe told FOX Business in June the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act raised new questions for businesses about whether they should relocate to a more business-friendly state.\n\nTennessee, meanwhile, boasts no income tax, one of nine states that does so, as well as lower property taxes, compared to states like New York and California (it does, however, levy a 6 percent hall tax on investment interests and dividends). Florida, Texas, Washington and Nevada are among the other states that do not levy an income tax on residents.\n\n\"It has driven, I think, a lot of good conversations for companies who are trying to lower their costs,\" Rolfe said.\n\nLikewise, a number of Wall Street companies are heading to Florida, which is quickly becoming a haven for financial firms.\n\nOver the past three years, more than 70 financial services companies moved into Palm County, the president of Palm County's Business Development Board told FOX Business in August.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n", "description": "The 83-year-old investor will close the Manhattan office at the end of March 2020 and open a new office near Miami one month later.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SJ7OTAk9pjWh.ZvBnsyr7Q--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/f9d3b2d0-d64c-11e9-af6f-a3c4c45d81b5", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
