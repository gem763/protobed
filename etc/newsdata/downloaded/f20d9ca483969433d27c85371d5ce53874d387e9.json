Another version is available for smartphones that use the Android operating system.\n\nAsked whether the Chinese government had asked Apple to remove HKmap.live from its online store, a foreign ministry spokesman said he had no information about that.\n\n\u201cWhat I can tell you is that these radical, violent crimes in Hong Kong have seriously challenged the legal system and social order in Hong Kong, threatened the safety of Hong Kong residents\u2019 lives and property, and undermined the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,\u201d said the spokesman, Geng Shuang.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has a conscience and justice should resist and oppose instead of supporting and indulging those actions,\u201d Geng said at a regular news briefing.\n\nThe demonstrations began over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include other grievances and demands for greater democracy.\n\nCriticism of Apple followed government attacks starting last weekend on the National Basketball Association over a comment by the general manager of the Houston Rockets in support of the protesters. China\u2019s state TV has canceled broadcasts of NBA games.\n\n\u201cApple jumped into this on its own and mixed together business with politics and commercial activity with illegal activities,\u201d People\u2019s Daily said.\n\nThe newspaper warned Apple might be damaging its reputation with Chinese consumers.\n\nBrands targeted in the past by Beijing have been subjected to campaigns by the entirely state-controlled press to drive away consumers or disruptive investigations by tax and other regulators.\n\nChina has long been critical to Apple\u2019s business.\n\nThe mainland is Apple\u2019s second-biggest market after the United States but CEO Tim Cook has said since 2013 it will eventually become No. 1. Sales in China declined 4% in the quarter ending in June, but that was an improvement over the 25% contraction in the first half of its fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThis recklessness will cause much trouble for Apple,\u201d People\u2019s Daily said. \u201cApple needs to think deeply.\u201d\n\nApple also is an important asset to China.\n\nMost of its iPhones and tablet computers are assembled in Chinese factories that employ hundreds of thousands of people. Chinese vendors supply components for Mac Pro computers that are assembled in Texas.", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 Apple became the latest company targeted for Chinese pressure over protests in Hong Kong when the ruling Communist Party's main newspaper", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/b6a983_hong-kong-protests-apple-02461-in-sept-24-2011-photo-an-apple-logo-is-displayed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
