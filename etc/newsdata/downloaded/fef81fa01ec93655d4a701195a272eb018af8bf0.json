Jasinski used to do keyword searches of the official school email accounts for the district\u2019s 2,600 students, looking for words like \u201csuicide\u201d or \u201cmarijuana\u201d. Then he would have to read through every message that included one of the words. The process would occasionally catch some concerning behavior, but \u201cit was cumbersome\u201d, Jasinski recalled.\n\nLast year Jasinski heard about a new option: following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, the technology company Bark was offering schools free, automated, 24-hour-a-day surveillance of what students were writing in their school emails, shared documents and chat messages, and sending alerts to school officials any time the monitoring technology flagged concerning phrases.\n\nThe automated alerts were a game-changer, said Jason Buck, the principal of the Missouri district\u2019s middle school. One Friday evening last fall, Buck was watching television at home when Bark alerted him that one of his students had just written an email to another student talking about self-harm. The principal immediately called the first student\u2019s mother: \u201cIs the student with you?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre they safe?\u201d\n\nGeneration Columbine: how mass shootings changed America's schools Read more\n\nBefore his school used Bark, the principal said, school officials would not know about cyberbullying or a student talking about hurting themselves unless one of their friends decided to tell an adult about it. Now, he said, \u201cBark has taken that piece out of it. The other student doesn\u2019t have to feel like they\u2019re betraying or tattling or anything like that.\u201d\n\nAlthough students at his school are aware they\u2019re being monitored, they were surprised at first at how quickly school administrators could follow up on what they had typed, Buck said. \u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018Hey, I sent this email two days ago,\u2019 [it\u2019s] \u2018You just sent this email three minutes ago, let\u2019s talk.\u2019\u201d\n\nBark and similar tech companies are now monitoring the emails and documents of millions of American students, across thousands of school districts, looking for signs of suicidal thoughts, bullying or plans for a school shooting.\n\nThe new school surveillance technology doesn\u2019t turn off when the school day is over: anything students type in official school email accounts, chats or documents is monitored 24 hours a day, whether students are in their classrooms or their bedrooms.\n\nTech companies are also working with schools to monitor students\u2019 web searches and internet usage, and, in some cases, to track what they are writing on public social media accounts.\n\nParents and students are still largely unaware of the scope and intensity of school surveillance, privacy experts say, even as the market for these technologies has grown rapidly, fueled by fears of school shootings, particularly in the wake of the Parkland shooting in February 2018, which left 17 people dead.\n\nDigital surveillance is just one part of a booming, nearly $3bn-a-year school security industry in the United States, where Republican lawmakers have blocked any substantial gun control legislation for a quarter century.\n\n\u201cSchools feel massive pressure to demonstrate that they\u2019re doing something to keep kids safe. This is something they can spend money on, roll out and tell parents, this is what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Chad Marlow, a privacy expert at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nUnlike gun control, Marlow said, \u201cSurveillance is politically palatable, and so they\u2019re pursuing surveillance as a way you can demonstrate action, even though there\u2019s no evidence that it will positively impact the problem.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tech companies are now monitoring the emails and documents of millions of American students, looking for signs of suicidal thoughts, bullying, or plans for a school shooting.

Privacy experts say pervasive monitoring may hurt children, and may be particularly dangerous for students with disabilities and students of color.\n\nDespite the lack of research evidence, tech companies are marketing school monitoring technologies with bold claims of hundreds of lives saved, mostly through prevention of youth suicide attempts.\n\nGaggle, a leading provider of school email and shared document monitoring, says its technology is currently used to monitor 4.5 million students across 1,400 school districts. The company claims that in the last academic year alone its technology \u201chelped districts save the lives of more than 700 students who were planning or actually attempting suicide\u201d.\n\nBark says it works with at least 1,400 school districts across the country, and claims its technology has helped prevent \u201c16 credible school shootings\u201d and detected \u201ctwenty thousand severe self-harm situations\u201d.\n\nSecurly, another leading provider, says its products are used to protect 10 million students across 10,000 individual schools. In the past year, Securly said it helped school officials intervene in 400 situations that presented an \u201cimminent threat\u201d.\n\nThe companies\u2019 statistics on lives saved are based on their own anecdotal data, and have not been independently evaluated.\n\n\u201cI heard from a lot of districts that in the weeks after Parkland, they were getting nonstop email solicitations from all sorts of brand new, or fairly new companies specializing in social media, that were saying, \u2018We can fix your problems,\u2019 and a lot of them were adopting it,\u201d America Vance, the director of education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum, said.\n\n\u201cSome people think that technology is magic, that artificial intelligence will save us,\u201d Vance said. \u201cA lot of the questions and a lot of the privacy concerns haven\u2019t [been] thought of, let alone addressed.\u201d\n\nHow it works\n\nIn Florence, South Carolina, school officials intervened after a middle school student started writing about suicide while working on an in-class English assignment. The phrases she typed in a Google document triggered an alert from Gaggle, the surveillance company working with the school district. \u201cWithin minutes\u201d, the student was pulled out of class for a conversation with school officials, according to Dr Richard O\u2019Malley, the district superintendent.\n\nIn Cincinnati, Ohio, the school district\u2019s chief information officer had to call the police in the middle of the night to conduct a wellness check on a student who had been flagged by Gaggle for writing about self-harm. The situation was serious enough that the student was hospitalized to receive mental health services, the chief information officer, Sarah Trimble-Oliver, said.\n\nIn rural Weld county, Colorado, a school official got an alert from GoGuardian, a company that monitors students\u2019 internet searches, that a student was doing a Google search for \u201chow to kill myself\u201d late one evening. The official worked with a social worker to call law enforcement to conduct an in-person safety check at the student\u2019s home, said Dr Teresa Hernandez, the district\u2019s chief intervention and safety officer. When the student\u2019s mother answered the door, she was confused, and said that her child had been upstairs sleeping since 9pm. \u201cWe had the search history to show, actually, no, that\u2019s not what was going on,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nFederal law requires that American public schools block access to harmful websites, and that they \u201cmonitor\u201d students\u2019 online activities. What exactly this \u201cmonitoring\u201d means has never been clearly defined: the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act, passed nearly 20 years ago, was driven in part by fears that American children might look at porn on federally funded school computers.\n\nAs technology has advanced and schools have integrated laptops and digital technology into every part of the school day, school districts have largely defined for themselves how to responsibly monitor students on school-provided devices \u2013 and how aggressive they think that monitoring should be.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In some cases, surveillance companies monitoring students may themselves directly contact local law enforcement to take action if they\u2019re concerned a threat is serious. Illustration: Guardian Design/The Guardian\n\nSchools have faced lawsuits by parents of students who have committed suicide and by parents of children who have been cyberbullied, said Vance, the student privacy expert.\n\n\u201cSchools are almost in a damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t situation. If they choose to be more privacy protective they could be sued, but on the other hand, they could be sued for over-surveilling,\u201d she said.\n\nBark\u2019s decision following the Parkland shooting to give away free email, chat and shared document monitoring to any school district that wanted it was partly altruistic, an effort to respond to a horrifying crisis, and partly strategic, with the hope that providing a free service for school districts would make it a trusted brand with parents, helping sales of its pro-profit parent surveillance products, which it markets for $9 a month, said Titania Jordan, the company\u2019s \u201cchief parenting officer\u201d.\n\nOther companies, some of which offer schools human analysts who help review the automated alerts, charge districts thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe amount American public school districts spend on email and document monitoring services appears to have increased sharply from 2013, the year after a mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, to 2018, from nearly $4m to more than $8m, according to an analysis of purchasing contracts between just two major monitoring companies, Gaggle and Securly, and roughly 250 school districts. These numbers appear to be an undercount of the full size of the market, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, the progressive advocacy group that compiled and analyzed the purchasing records.\n\nAs of 2018, at least 60 American school districts had also spent more than $1m on separate monitoring technology to track what their students were saying on public social media accounts, an amount that spiked sharply in the wake of the 2018 Parkland school shooting, according to the Brennan Center.\n\nValues at stake\n\nSome proponents of school monitoring say the technology is part of educating today\u2019s students in how to be good \u201cdigital citizens\u201d, and that monitoring in school helps train students for constant surveillance after they graduate.\n\n\u201cTake an adult in the workforce. You can\u2019t type anything you want in your work email: it\u2019s being looked at,\u201d Bill McCullough, a Gaggle spokesperson, said. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing kids to become successful adults.\u201d\n\nExperience with school monitoring is a \u201ctraining ground\u201d that might mean that students \u201cwon\u2019t lose their job for sharing inappropriate content\u201d, said Trimble-Oliver, the chief information officer for Cincinnati\u2019s public school district, which uses Gaggle.\n\nStudents \u201cneed to know that organizations can and probably are monitoring their content\u201d, she said.\n\nPrivacy experts called these arguments \u201cconcerning\u201d, and note that there are legal limits to how companies can monitor employees\u2019 work emails.\n\n\u201cThe idea that everything students are searching for or everything that they\u2019re writing down is going to be monitored by their school can really inhibit growth and self-discovery,\u201d Natasha Duarte, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said.\n\nFor black students, and students with disabilities, who already face a disproportionate amount of harsh disciplinary measures, the introduction of new kinds of surveillance may be especially harmful, privacy experts said.\n\nBoth machine-learning algorithms and human analysts are at risk of misunderstanding what students write \u2013 particularly if the human analysts are older, or from different cultural backgrounds than the students they are monitoring, experts said. If digital surveillance companies scanning students\u2019 emails and chats misinterpret their jokes or sarcasm as real threats, that \u201ccould expose students to law enforcement in a way they have not been in the past\u201d, said Elizabeth Laird, the senior fellow for student privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nThe consequences of involving law enforcement in responding to what students are typing on their school computers is a particular concern in a country where more than 40% of schools have police officers inside school buildings serving as dedicated \u201cschool resource officers\u201d, Vance said.\n\nIn some cases, surveillance companies monitoring students may themselves directly contact local law enforcement officials to take action if they\u2019re concerned a threat is serious, and if school officials have given them permission to do so. The data surveillance companies are collecting on students may also be shared with law enforcement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Parents and students are still largely unaware of the scope and intensity of school surveillance, privacy experts say. Illustration: Guardian Design/The Guardian\n\nSecurly, one of the leading educational surveillance companies, makes it possible for the human analysts who evaluate potentially troubling student messages to look back at the history of an individual student\u2019s internet browsing history and web searches, allowing them to connect the dots between what students are reading, writing, searching for, and, in some cases, posting on social media.\n\nSecurly will share information with law enforcement \u201cif there\u2019s a warrant or subpoena\u201d, Mike Jolley, the company\u2019s director of K-12 Safety, said. Data about individual students is deleted when the students graduate, or when schools request it, Jolley said.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, school surveillance technology has already been tested for use in counter-terrorism efforts. Impero, a British education software company, piloted its monitoring technology as a counter-terrorism tool, flagging children for using phrases like \u201cJihadi bride\u201d, \u201cWar on Islam\u201d, or \u201cYou only die once\u201d, the Guardian reported in 2015.\n\nThe company billed this as a \u201cde-radicalisation effort\u201d that would help teachers and other officials identify \u201cvulnerable children\u201d or \u201cchildren that may be at risk in the future\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly fair to ask to what extent we feel comfortable with technologies first developed for use in war being used against our children,\u201d Marlow, the ACLU expert, said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what kind of \u201cchilling effect\u201d the monitoring might have on students\u2019 self-exploration, their group conversations and their academic freedom, Marlow, the ACLU privacy expert, said. If students know their schools are monitoring their computer usage, will LGBTQ students in conservative school districts feel comfortable researching their sexuality? What about young Trump supporters in liberal school districts who want to do some political research?\n\n\u201cSchools don\u2019t post on a bulletin board outside the principal\u2019s office, \u2018Here are the words we\u2019re searching for,\u2019\u201d Marlow said. \u201cIt forces students to be careful. They might not write about things or talk about things that are not, in fact, being monitored.\u201d\n\nShifts in culture\n\nSchool officials say that their primary motivation for using surveillance technology is the chance to save a student\u2019s life. But schools are monitoring students\u2019 digital documents in real time for a wide range of content they see as problematic, from swear words to nude images and pornography to cyberbullying to evidence of drug and alcohol use.\n\nIn Weld county, Colorado, a student emailed a teacher that she heard two boys were going to smoke weed in a bathroom, Hernandez, the student services and safety director, said. Gaggle immediately alerted school officials: \u201cWithin four minutes of her sending this email, the troops had deployed,\u201d she said.\n\nGaggle also automatically sends students a scolding email any time they use a profanity.\n\nA few school districts have chosen not to send students Gaggle\u2019s warnings about swear words, some because they\u2019re concerned that if students are reminded that they\u2019re being monitored, \u201cthe children will then resort to other tools to communicate, and they\u2019ll miss the life-threatening issues they could have intervened in,\u201d McCullough, the Gaggle spokesperson, said.\n\nMcCullough said these fears were misplaced, and that the company had seen little evidence that the students being surveilled on school devices had switched to other forms of communication.\n\n\u201cKids who have used us in their districts for years and years still use these tools to communicate their innermost thoughts, because they\u2019re hoping that their cries for help are answered, and they\u2019re not comfortable communicating the way adults communicate, face-to-face,\u201d McCullough said.\n\nO\u2019Malley, the South Carolina superintendent whose district uses Gaggle, had a different impression of how kids in his district had reacted to the new surveillance.\n\n\u201cOnce the kids know they\u2019re being Gaggled, they\u2019re being watched 24-7, they tend to be more proactive in watching what they do,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\n\nHe said he had heard students in the district using Gaggle, the surveillance company\u2019s name, as a verb: \u201cWe can\u2019t do that. We\u2019re being Gaggled.\u201d\n\nDrawing the line\n\nWhile parents are often \u201cgrateful\u201d for the information that comes from an intervention, Buck, the Missouri principal, said, students can be \u201ca little bit upset sometimes. They feel like there\u2019s a little bit of that privacy issue. But over the course of time they see we\u2019re really trying to help, especially when we\u2019re talking about the issue of self-harm.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest School officials say that the technology is still far from perfect, and that they have received false alerts for the classic American novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Illustration: Guardian Design/The Guardian\n\nSome school surveillance companies defended their products as more sensitive to students\u2019 privacy than their competitors \u2013 or the students\u2019 own parents.\n\n\u201cSome parents want technology that will give them an exact record of every single text, every single email,\u201d Jordan, Bark\u2019s chief parenting officer, said. But Bark does not offer that, she said: \u201cWe only alert parents and schools when there is a real issue that they need to know about.\u201d\n\nFor Gaggle, McCullough said, the bright line was offering monitoring of only students\u2019 official school emails and school documents.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be looking at their private email. We shouldn\u2019t be looking at their private social media posts. But in the school, with school-issued tools, we should protect them,\u201d McCullough said.\n\nSecurly, in contrast, offers a free app for parents in the districts that use its technology that allows them to see exactly what websites their children have visited, what Google searches they have made, and what videos they are watching on YouTube, Jolley, Securly\u2019s safety director, said\n\nAt the moment, the company has no privacy protections for LGBTQ students who might need to search for information without their parents knowing about it, although Jolley said that was a concern the company was actively discussing.\n\nWhile school surveillance companies tout products informed by \u201cmachine learning\u201d, and \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, school officials say that the technology is still far from perfect, and that they have received plenty of false alerts, like getting red flags when students tell each other sarcastically to \u201ckill yourself\u201d, talk about the band Suicide Boys, or have to write a school assignment on the classic American novel To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nAn investigation into school surveillance by Education Week examined nearly 3000 alerts that Gaggle sent to one school district in Michigan. Most of these were \u201cminor violations,\u201d including a dozen students who stored or sent files that contained the word \u201cgay,\u201d and one who used the word \u201cbastard\u201d in a school assignment about the Odyssey.\n\nAfter he had received multiple alerts from the same group of middle school boys who were sending edgy memes to each other, sometimes as late as 3am, Buck, the Missouri principal, called the boys into the office and encouraged them to find another way to share their jokes \u2013 perhaps a group text message \u2013 that would not constantly alert their principal.", "description": "Fueled by fears of school shootings, the market has grown rapidly for technologies that monitor students through official school emails and chats", "authors": ["Lois Beckett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac25b2c9cae2aa6b4ad00f2f4a4732b752a9605e/0_128_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2f1ed5490e6ee54320f202d2a03d4977", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
