Then all of a sudden, they were on TV showing off their new Ferraris, and the music started going down hill. So as a young kid who took their music very seriously, I felt like they were selling out,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\n\u201cI didn't know I was going to swear or anything. I just knew I wanted to get on there and give them a piece of my teenage mind.\u201d\n\nFive Star had been on the show to promote their 18th single With Every Heartbeat, and were shocked to hear young Eliot\u2019s expletive-ridden question.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHowever, the adult Eliot insists he has nothing to apologise for.\n\n\u201cNo apologies. What\u2019s done is done. As an adult you kind of feel slightly different about it, but the child in me is like, \u2018No\u2019,\u201d he went on.\n\n\u201cNo regrets at all. It's funny listening to it now, because I do sound really, really angry. I think that's why it stuck in people's minds.\u201d\n\nHowever, a second man claiming to be Eliot Fletcher cropped up two weeks ago on Twitter to apologise for the outburst to Five Star singer Doris Pearson, who graciously accepted - and even asked him out for a pint to settle the matter.\n\nBut this Eliot\u2019s identity could not be verified - although Doris didn\u2019t seem to mind either way.\n\n\"You know, it was so many moons ago, and I'm a forgiving gal,\" she added to the BBC.\n\n\u201dAnd to be honest, all I thought at the time was, 'Well, we're actually not crap'.\"", "description": "Speaking more than 30 years on, the man says he holds no regrets about his savage outburst in the prank phone call", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530039.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_EMP_CHP_071019five-star_295fivestarJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
