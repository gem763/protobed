To travel along it is to experience the complexities of an area that may soon become a new frontline in Syria\u2019s war.\n\nThe road leads east from Jarablus, where Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies are currently preparing for battle. It crosses the Euphrates River, hugging the border until it reaches Kobani, a town where Kurdish fighters faced down one of the most intensive Isis assaults of the entire war. A giant statue stands in the main square as a monument to that resistance.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Further on, before the town of Ras al-Ayn, to where the US and Turkey recently started conducting joint patrols. Finally it arrives at Qamishli, a city of some 250,000 people and the heart of the Kurdish north east.\n\nTurkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called this stretch of road a \u201cterrorist corridor\u201d and argued that a Turkish-run safe zone is necessary to bring order. But to many of those who live within it, this zone is already safe.\n\nThe Syrian conflict presented the country\u2019s Kurdish population with something of a paradox: they were threatened with annihilation, but they also won new freedoms. For decades, the minority population had been treated as second class citizens by the Syrian government.\n\nWhen the war came, they armed themselves and kicked government forces out. They faced down a series of attacks from jihadists groups, Syrian rebels and eventually Isis.\n\nUnder Turkey\u2019s plans, all of these towns and villages along the border would be taken over by its armed forces and allied Syrian rebel groups. Ankara has justified its impending operation as a necessary measure to protect its border from the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) \u2013 the largest contingent of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which allied with the US to defeat Isis.\n\nIt argues that the group is little more than a branch of an outlawed Kurdish separatist group with whom the Turkish state has been at war for decades.\n\nThe safe zone may be aimed at weakening the SDF, but civilians who have endured years of war will also be in the firing line.\n\nOver the past few years, people in the towns and villages in the proposed safe zone have lived in relative peace. The YPG has not been without its critics in the areas it controls, and has been accused of forced recruitment into its ranks, but the cover given to it by the US military\u2019s backing afforded people in the region the space to build the foundations of an autonomous administration. And yet the project has always been on borrowed time. Even before the battle against Isis finished, Turkey was threatening to cross the border.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Gunfire had been exchanged between Kurdish forces and Turkish positions.\n\nAt that time, SDF positions sat a few hundred metres away from the border. Today, many of them have now been dismantled.\n\nA few months later I was in Qamishli, the largest Kurdish majority city Syria, where residents said they too are preparing for a Turkish incursion.\n\n\u201cRight now we are trying to save our money in case of an invasion,\u201d a man named Abu Amar said, shortly after Donald Trump announced that he would be withdrawing US troops. \u201cIf the Turks come here, it will be like when Isis controlled these areas. I will leave everything behind and go.\u201d\n\nSome said they feared a repeat of what happened in the mostly Kurdish enclave of Afrin, which Turkey invaded to force out Kurdish fighters. The rebel groups it left behind to control the area have been accused of a litany of human rights abuses since.\n\n\u201cIn Afrin, the people suffered massacres. That\u2019s what will happen here,\u201d said Sardar Khalil, a 60-year-old technician. \u201cRight now there is peace for us. But in Afrin no one is allowed to move.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations, which currently delivers aid to 700,000 people in the densely-populated north-east region, said it had already drawn up contingency plans to reach people who might flee the fighting. On Monday, it issued a stark warning of what lies ahead.\n\n\u201cFor us as the United Nations, the safe zone concept is one that we have a bitter history with and actually we never promote or encourage. We don\u2019t think it is something that had worked for the United Nations, keeping in mind Srebrenica and what had happened in the past,\u201d said Panos Moumtzis, UN regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis.\n\nBeyond the crisis, there are fears that Turkey plans to permanently alter the demographic balance of the area. Ankara has said it plans to resettle some two million Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey to the area. Many fear a repeat of a 1970s government policy of Arabisation under president Hafez al-Assad, which saw Kurdish farmland confiscated and handed to Arabs relocated from other provinces.\n\nEven if a deal is reached on the safe zone, the SDF faces another powerful foe in the form of the Syrian government, and its ally Russia. Damascus has made it clear that it intends to reassert its control over the entire country.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement that the US would not stand in the way of a Turkish operation to attack the SDF was just the latest sign that the White House was losing interest.\n\nAnd so, after years of conflict, Kurds in north-east Syria could soon face their biggest upheaval yet.", "description": "There is a road in northeast Syria that runs alongside the border with Turkey, so close in parts that the imposing wall which separates the two countries casts a shadow over it.\u00a0 It stretches for more than 200 miles through Turkey\u2019s proposed \u201csafe zone\u201d.
