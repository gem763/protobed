Jacqueline, who loves to garden, adds: \u201cYou can grow 365 days a year. It is a gardener\u2019s paradise.\u201d\n\n\u2018Our friends think we are crazy, but they also envy us. An alternative lifestyle can be going overseas, but you can also go overseas and be alternative. We do both.\u2019 Jacqueline Mackenzie\n\nThough Vilcabamba is small (the town and surrounding valleys are home to about 4,000 residents), plenty of expats, particularly Americans, Canadians and Europeans, live there: \u201cThere are a lot of aging hippies,\u201d Jacqueline jokes. Vilcabamba is particularly appealing to people who love an outdoorsy lifestyle \u2014 hiking and bird watching are popular here \u2014 and it, along with most of Ecuador, has a strong ecological bent. In 2008, Ecuador was believed to have become the first country in the world to extend constitutional rights to nature, with one passage of the document spelling out that nature \u201chas the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution,\u201d as the New York Times reported at the time.\n\nThis ecological leaning is one of the big reasons the Mackenzies moved to the country. They live in a so-called eco-village \u2014 residents here seek to have minimal impact on the natural environment and give back to the planet. \u201cWe do what we can in whatever way we can to live a life that\u2019s less consumerist,\u201d Jacqueline says.\n\nThat means they grow much of their own food, live in a home made of sustainable wood and stone, have a composting toilet, get their electricity from wind and water, and don\u2019t have a hot-water heater (the water is heated by the sun). Jacqueline explains: \u201cWe try to live a very simple life.\u201d\n\nJacqueline Mackenzie The Mackenzie home in the eco-village.\n\nIt\u2019s a life they say they adore \u2014 since 2013, Jacqueline has only been back to the United States once, and Don hasn\u2019t been back at all since then. Though this, of course, is not for everyone. The town is small, and some say it\u2019s too good to be true. Still, as Don points out, \u201cthe air is so clean, and I can\u2019t get over the intensity of the blue sky.\u201d And Jacqueline jokes that because even their grandkids are now grown, \u201cwe are just working at living.\u201d\n\nWhat do you spend each month?\n\nThe Mackenzies live on about $2,000 a month, most of that coming from Don\u2019s pension (he\u2019s retired from the military), they say. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford the States, but here we are rich,\u201d Jacqueline says \u2014 adding that they now live in a home with a \u201cmillion-dollar view.\u201d\n\nTheir biggest expense when they first moved to Ecuador was rent: They paid $400 a month for a three-bedroom house on a quarter-acre of land before they moved to the eco-village last year; now they don\u2019t pay rent, having built their home for about $38,000. They lease the land for free because they help out at the eco-village; when they die their home and most of its contents will go to the owner of the eco-village. They paid for the house through a combination of savings and loans.\n\nNow they spend the biggest proportion of their money on food \u2014 roughly $375 a month \u2014 in part because, as Jacqueline says, they are committed to eating organic whenever they can. Other significant expenses include transportation \u2014 they don\u2019t own a car but spend about $350 a month on taxis \u2014 and health insurance. That costs them about $100 a month, though they do have out-of-pocket health-care costs like doctor\u2019s appointments and prescriptions, which can add up. Internet service costs them a little over $80 a month, and a mobile-phone plan costs $28 a month. They also spend money on things like gardening tools, gardeners, seeds, trees and soil.\n\nIn addition to their simple lifestyle, they save money by not having a television \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019ve not had access to a TV for eight months, so we are entertained by nature\u2019s sunrises and sunsets,\u201d Jacqueline says \u2014 and by not traveling a lot and not eating out. \u201cWe like the rural lifestyle,\u201d says Jacqueline. \u201cEating out is not a big deal to us. We\u2019ve already been to bazillions of concerts and plays. Now we listen to music with a glass of wine on the patio.\u201d\n\nJacqueline Mackenzie The Mackenzies outside their home.\n\nWhat\u2019s health care like in Ecuador?\n\nThe Mackenzies say thus far they\u2019ve been impressed with Ecuador\u2019s health-care system. They both have insurance through Ecuador\u2019s government (which costs about $100 a month total), and their out-of-pocket costs haven\u2019t been too bad. When she had her hip replaced a few years back in Guayaquil, the second largest city in Ecuador, Jacqueline says the out-of-pocket costs were about $1,800. But because they live in a small town, they do have to travel about an hour for some surgeries (when Don had an operation a few years back, he did so in the nearby city of Loja).\n\nYou can read more about the costs of health insurance in Ecuador here and read expats talking about the quality and cost of care here.\n\nHow hard is it to get residency?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d Jacqueline says. \u201cIt is complicated.\u201d This resource can help you figure out what you might need if you want to stay for an extended period or become a permanent resident.\n\nWhat do you miss about the United States?\n\n\u201cNot the politics,\u201d jokes Jacqueline \u2014 who says it\u2019s her friends she misses most. \u201cI do my best to stay in touch but I do miss them.\u201d For Don, it\u2019s Home Depot HD, +1.31% \u2014 \u201cgetting parts for building is difficult here, it can take two to three months.\u201d\n\nBottom line:\n\nDespite the great weather and their simple lifestyle \u2014 both of which they embrace \u2014 Jacqueline and Don say it\u2019s the people they love most. Don gets together every Sunday with a group of about a dozen expats for brunch \u201cto resolve the world\u2019s problems,\u201d he jokes. And Jacqueline is a member of a \u201csister circle\u201d of roughly a dozen women where \u201cwe try to be as emotionally supportive as possible.\u201d Plus, young people from all over the world come to visit the eco-village, so sometimes \u201cthere might be five different languages spoken over one meal,\u201d Jacqueline says.\n\n\u201cOur friends [in the U.S.] think we are crazy, but they also envy us,\u201d Jacqueline says. \u201cAn alternative lifestyle can be going overseas, but you can also go overseas and be alternative. We do both.\u201d", "description": "They haven\u2019t been back to the U.S. in years, and say they don\u2019t miss it much (except for Home Depot and some friends).", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM323_jackie_ZG_20190627101319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-27"}
