Backbench eurosceptic Conservative MPs have, however, been won over to the deal.\n\nTheresa May's original 2018 deal included a range of specific enforceable common standards for the UK and the EU within the legally binding Withdrawal Treaty.\n\nSome of these standards were related to EU law, others referred to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), International Labour Organisation and the Council of Europe.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Business minister Kwesi Kwarteng said the leaked reports are \"completely mad\"\n\nThese were all removed, along with the backstop, and the only reference remaining in the overall deal was in the non-binding Political Declaration.\n\nThe memo shows that within Whitehall, weakening these provisions was a key part of the renegotiation.\n\nRegarded as an internal success, their removal paves the way for a \"much more open starting point for future relationship negotiations\" that allow for \"a range of landing zones\" for a future deal.\n\n'Exaggerated'\n\n\"The Political Declaration text provides us with a framework for negotiating FTA-style commitments on Level Playing Field,\" the memo concludes under the headline \"Next Steps\".\n\nThat is a reference to the fact that, unlike the original Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May, dispute settlement mechanisms have not applied to existing standard EU Free Trade Agreements.\n\nSam Lowe, trade fellow at the Centre for European Reform, said: \"The Level Playing Field commitments in the EU's Free Trade Agreements with Canada and Japan are unenforceable, because they are specifically excluded from the dispute settlement mechanisms. The government appears to be aiming for the same treatment.\"\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly rejected suggestions there are attempts to relax workplace rights or environmental protections.\n\n\"In many areas we have already gone further than the European Union,\" he said. \"We are making hard improvements on worker rights through an increase in the National Living Wage.\"\n\nThe government was also strengthening rules on maritime protection and animal welfare, he added.\n\nOn Saturday, ministers said stories about the leaked memo were \"not correct\" and \"way exaggerated\".\n\nThe government also said: \"The UK government has no intention of lowering the standards of workers' rights or environmental protection after we leave the EU.\n\n\"UK level playing field commitments will be negotiated in the context of the future UK-EU free trade agreement, where we will achieve a balance of rights and obligations which reflect the scope and depth of the future relationship.\"", "description": "Worker rights: UK negotiators remove \u201cadequate\u201d from employment and environmental standards enforcement.", "authors": ["Faisal Islam", "Economics Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/18282/production/_109264989_gettyimages-898438616.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
