There have been suggestions in the lead-up that Biden will attack Warren aggressively, hoping to blunt her momentum. \u201cShe\u2019s promised about $50 trillion worth of benefits in the last 30 days. Her economics are [a] fraud and at some point someone is going to point that out. She\u2019s a multimillionaire professor at Harvard. She can\u2019t rail against the one percent\u2014she is one of the one percent,\u201d Biden surrogate Dick Harpootlian told Politico, outlining a series of possible fronts. (These attacks are a bit rich coming from Harpootlian, who supported Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign.)\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that at the end of the day, the biggest criticism of Elizabeth Warren is her inability to make her plans actual reality. There are a lot of voters\u2014especially black voters\u2014who will say, \u2018A lot of this is pie in the sky and we want pie on the table,\u201d Harris surrogate Bakari Sellers told Politico. Given the ambitiousness of much of the policy work being done in the primary so far, these are attacks that will probably ultimately be lobbed at every Democrat, but they likely preview how Warren and Sanders will be targeted next month.\n\n\n\nFor fellow Democrats, attacking Warren and Sanders on policy grounds is foolish and self-defeating (though that alone practically guarantees that it will happen). The senators\u2019 agenda is popular and has revolutionized the party; voters are hungry for new ideas. Moreover, practically every candidate has an ambitious policy proposal or two of his or her own. The idea that Democrats shouldn\u2019t talk enthusiastically about improving people\u2019s lives in every way possible because of vague worries about \u201celectability\u201d makes little sense, particularly in this early phase of the primary.\n\n\n\nWhile there\u2019s clearly desire among the media to see a fight between Warren and the field, it still doesn\u2019t make sense for any of the other candidates\u2014with the exception of Biden. For the former vice president, attempting to halt the rise of the candidate who seems, at this juncture, to have the best shot of snatching the nomination from his grasp, is a calculated risk he might feel he needs to take. But for everyone else, it\u2019s premature. Although Warren is steadily rising, she still commands only a fifth of voters. Biden consistently polls much higher and remains the front-runner.\n\n\n\nBut he also remains the party\u2019s biggest liability, particularly after yet another gaffe-filled week. Surveys suggest his support is much shallower than it appears, and there are signs that there is little enthusiasm behind his candidacy. On policy, he\u2019s retrograde, an embodiment of a status quo that does not inspire voters. There\u2019s novelty in targeting Warren, so that\u2019s what many who need to boost clicks or ratings want. The candidates, however, might have a different metric in mind\u2014one measured in votes and delegates\u2014so for them, it\u2019s still Biden season.\n\n", "description": "The media are chumming the waters for a takedown of the senator in the next Democratic debate.
