But it was not long before he was back in business, growing weed in a hotel near Bristol.\n\nHe had earned nearly $19,000 - a small fortune compared with salaries back home - but accuses his boss of cheating him out of thousands more.\n\nForced labour\n\nMost migrants from Vietnam come from poor central provinces. Many head to the UK, sending cash home which is spent on new cars, motorbikes and home renovations.\n\nResearchers value the UK's annual marijuana trade at around US$3.2bn [File: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images]\n\nBut the journey is not cheap.\n\nSmugglers charge up to $40,000 for travel documents and a plane ticket, usually to eastern Europe where the overland trip to the UK begins.\n\nSome fall prey to traffickers; by the time they make it across the English Channel they are thousands of dollars in debt and forced to work in brothels, nail bars or cannabis farms.\n\nMore than 3,100 Vietnamese adults and children were identified as potential trafficking victims by the UK government between 2009 and 2018, according to a report by Anti-Slavery International, ECPAT UK and Pacific Links Foundation.\n\nCuong eventually headed to London, where he drifted for several years, selling drugs and training new cannabis farmers.\n\nBut in 2014 he was arrested for smoking cannabis. His fingerprints tied him to the Bristol grow house.\n\nCrown Court records show he was convicted for growing cannabis and sentenced to 10 months' jail. Eventually, he was deported.\n\nHe joined more than 1,600 returnees to Vietnam either by choice or by force since 2014, including at least 22 who were under the age of 14, according to Home Office data.\n\nHundreds of other children have been identified as potential trafficking victims by the Home Office.\n\nSome are back in Vietnam in debt and at serious risk of being retrafficked in what amounts to a \"merry-go-round\" of crime and poverty, according to independent trafficking expert Mimi Vu.\n\nAdjusting to life in Vietnam has been tough for Cuong, who returned broke and now lives in a bare house in Haiphong.\n\nBut he says he is reformed and hopes to open a salon to help provide for the baby he is expecting with his new girlfriend.\n\n\"In the past I had to be tough and aggressive,\" he says. \"Now I have to be soft and nice.\"", "description": "Gang members and migrants from Vietnam keep Britain's multi-billion dollar marijuana industry running.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/4f9083d9bda649fca2d3247095b6b405_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
