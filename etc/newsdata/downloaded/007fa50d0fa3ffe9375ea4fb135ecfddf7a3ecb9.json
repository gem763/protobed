Data from Reuters' Eikon predicted a loss of a \u00a319.2 million for the quarter. Barclays had posted a \u00a31 billion net profit in the same period last year.\n\n\"Third quarter for the markets business was overall reasonable. Many of the markets still have very little volatility such as certain parts of the foreign exchange market, Barclays' Chief Executive Jes Staley told CNBC's Squawk Box Friday.\n\n\"Overall on a dollar basis the U.S. investment banks' markets businesses were up roughly 6% as were we, so again we stayed in line with the U.S. banks. We did particularly well in the fixed income and the credit space, so it was a good quarter all things considered for us but we do look forward to a little more volatility in the markets down the road.\"", "description": "Barclays reported a third-quarter net loss of \u00a3292 million Friday, as difficult market conditions and concerns over Brexit continue to weigh.", "authors": ["Spriha Srivastava"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105023102-branch_of_Barclays_bank.jpg?v=1532563679", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
