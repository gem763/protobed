He told me that when he showed this old passport to his employer they told him that if the Home Office saw it they would deport him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I contacted Jackelin McKenzie [a solicitor]. Dexter and I went to see Miss McKenzie who told him he would have to apply for a Grenadian passport and supply records of early life in Britain to get a British passport.\n\n\u2018He got his Granadan passport. Throughout this period of his life he was stressed and depressed.\n\nShe added: \u2018I\u2019m hurt and upset that he had to prove his right to live in the UK, I don\u2019t think he would have died aged only 58 if he had not gone through the year of stress and worry.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
