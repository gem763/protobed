Sterling is now the best performing G10 currency over the last 30 days, with most of that upside coming since Boris Johnson lost control of Parliament.\n\nThe prime minister has now prorogued Parliament, effectively shutting down further debate until the middle of October. Johnson was again refused the prospect of an election in yet another defeat for the government in the Commons last night.\n\nTraders will be watching what the government does very closely. Sterling was also boosted by positive economic data which saw the UK economy grow by 0.3% in July.\n\nBanks up despite ongoing PPI impact fears\n\nThe opened down marginally this morning. Lloyds (LON: ) Bank, Barclays (LON: ) and HSBC were all in the green as they bounced back from news of a last minute rush of PPI claims in August. Banks like Lloyds and Co-op have already said they expect last minute requests to hit financial performance in Q2-3. Lloyds is still well down on its July levels following heavy selling in August.\n\nChina data pushes Asian and European markets down\n\nChina\u2019s blue chip share index, the CSI300, was down 0.41% overnight as more negative economic data emerged.
