(Photo by Hannah Foslien/Getty Images)\n\nThe point Minnesota added to increase its lead to 28-0 in the fourth quarter against Rutgers wasn\u2019t an ordinary extra point.\n\nThe kick marked the first college football action for Casey O\u2019Brien, a redshirt sophomore holder for the Gophers. O\u2019Brien\u2019s appearance is significant. He\u2019s a four-time cancer survivor who has held onto his role on the Minnesota football team despite multiple rounds of chemotherapy and 14 surgeries.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCasey O'Brien!\n\n\n\nThat's it.

He has been cancer-free for more than a year. He told the Athletic this summer that he was told football wouldn\u2019t be a part of his life after the diagnosis.\n\n\u201cWhen I was first diagnosed with cancer, I was told that I wouldn\u2019t play football again,\u201d O\u2019Brien told The Athletic. \u201cAnd I knew that I needed football in my life, that had been something that had been there my whole life, and I just wasn\u2019t ready to give it up. So I kind of had a back and forth with the doctors, like there\u2019s gotta be a way that I can still play. I ended up talking them into letting me move from quarterback to placeholder. This was after nine months of chemotherapy, and eight-and-a-half-hour knee surgery, they were like, you can\u2019t take a hit. I was like, OK, all I can either be a punter or I could be a place holder. I can\u2019t punt at all, so that narrowed it down to one position.\u201d\n\nAnd when Minnesota added another touchdown later in the fourth quarter, O\u2019Brien was back out on the field for a second hold to help his team go up 35-0.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Casey O'Brien, a four-time cancer survivor, saw his first college action on Saturday.", "authors": ["Sam Cooper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/44yChk5v5iyHTyVOrb8J6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PIBI_zP9xi4ihWMoeCnOjA--~B/aD0zMzU4O3c9NTAzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ea668260-f2c0-11e9-b44e-a504daa71fe1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
