To the broader community, who rallied in such passionate support for our daughter, we apologize for betraying your trust.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe understand there will be consequences and we\u2019re prepared to take responsibility for them,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe know that it will take time to heal, and we hope and pray that the boys, their families, the school and the broader community will be able to forgive us in time.\u201d\n\nMessages left for family members seeking additional comment were not immediately returned.\n\nAD\n\nThree boys accused of assaulting girl, cutting her dreadlocks at private Virginia school\n\nThe school\u2019s principal, Stephen Danish, also issued a statement and sent an email to parents and community members.\n\n\u201cWe can now confirm that the student who accused three of her classmates of assault has acknowledged that the allegations were false. We\u2019re grateful to the Fairfax County Police Department for their diligent work to investigate these allegations,\u201d Danish wrote. \u201cWhile we are relieved to hear the truth and bring the events of the past few days to a close, we also feel tremendous pain for the victims and the hurt on both sides of this conflict. We recognize that we now enter what will be a long season of healing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFairfax police launched an investigation into the incident last week after they were contacted by the girl\u2019s family. The department said that they cannot comment on developments because the subjects involved are all juveniles.\n\nAD\n\nThe Fairfax County NAACP issued a statement thanking Fairfax County police for quickly launching an investigation of the alleged incident and the school for \u201cbeing forthcoming and open\u201d throughout the process.\n\nThe civil rights organization acknowledged the sixth-grader\u2019s charge was false but cautioned against a rush to judgment about the validity of allegations of racial violence.\n\n\u201cToo often in these rare instances of fabricated hate crimes, critics use a broad brush to claim racially motivated crimes are virtually non-existent,\u201d the organization stated. \u201cThis is demonstrably wrong. Data from numerous sources, including the Anti-Defamation League, the FBI, and the Justice Department, shows bias motivated crimes are on the rise, year over year.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImmanuel Christian is a private K-10 National Blue Ribbon school with 469 students. Just under half the pupils are students of color, according to information provided by Immanuel officials. African American students account for 11 percent of the school population. Tuition for middle-school students is $11,500. Vice President Pence\u2019s wife, Karen Pence, teaches art part time at the school in grades one through five.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "Immanuel Christian principal says school is entering \u201ca long season of healing.\u201d", "authors": ["Joe Heim", "Reporter Covering A Range Of Topics", "Including Race", "Schools", "Student Culture", "White Nationalism", "Native American Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wPvewH2UCxkk0dGx84erhN2aCqM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7ZIZUIVIHII6NOSZU7MTCZOG2Q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
