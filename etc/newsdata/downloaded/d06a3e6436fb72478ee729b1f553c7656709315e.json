It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.\n\nMa said his menu paid tribute to a pivotal moment in Hong Kong's history, although some had warned him against poking fun at the violence.\n\nFor $17, his \"full gear\" menu - a nod to the equipment, including gas masks and shields, some frontline protesters carried - also features \"Five Demands\" rice balls, named for the changes sought by the protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Angie Teo; Writing by Poppy McPherson; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "description": "Pro-democracy protests that have roiled Hong Kong for more than three months are providing culinary inspiration for a restaurant that offers a themed menu with spicy wasabi-spiked \"tear gas\" eggs and a drink shaped like a bloodied eyeball.
