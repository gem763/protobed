And the Fed gets its , along with a host of other central banks, including Japan\u2019s. The question is, what will gold do?\n\nCompared to its scintillating run between May and August, gold\u2019s performance in recent days has been nothing short of anemic.\n\nEven after the European Central Bank\u2019s return to quantitative easing on Thursday, the yellow metal barely settled higher. The only consolation is that it got a huge pop early in the day that vanished on profit-taking before the close.\n\nHow High Will Gold Go; How Long Will It Last At Those Peaks?\n\nAll this makes gold\u2019s next breakout hard to predict\u2014from how high it will go, to how long the run-up will last.\n\nSo, to reprise the question: What will gold longs do if the Federal Reserve cuts rates on Sept 18, as widely expected, even if for a nominal 25 basis points?\n\nAnd what if that action is followed through by a rash of easing by the central banks of , and , all of which have policy decisions on Sept 19, just a day after the Fed\u2019s?\n\nWill gold longs reach for the stars then? Or will they be content to just land on the tree tops?\n\nTwo Schools Of Thought\n\nThere are two schools of thought on the direction for the world\u2019s favorite safe haven.\n\nOne is that the gold rally has reached exhaustion point, meaning there will be fewer of the kind of outsize gains seen over the past four months. Even if there are, those advances are likely to be returned quickly.\n\nThe other is that longs in the precious metal are virtually unstoppable, and could, if the stars align, rewrite the 2011 record high of above $1,900 per ounce.\n\nGold Weekly Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nRBC Calls For $1,500 Gold\n\nCanadian banking group RBC belongs to the first school of thought, forecasting on Thursday a modest assumption of $1,500 for the remainder of 2019 and 2020. It\u2019s previous call was $1,350.\n\nWhile the Fed\u2019s expected action will be the underlying driver for $1,500 gold, RBC said the precious metal\n\n\u201cat this point \u2026 appears to be pricing in a no-successful completion for a U.S.-China free trade agreement before year-end\u201d.\n\nIt added:\n\n\u201cWe expect a seasonal rally in the gold price in the December - January period.\u201d\n\nEven so, RBC had a more low-key projection for 2021 and above, forecasting an average price of $1,450, versus earlier estimates of $1,300. For the long-term, it put down a price of $1,400.\n\nRBC did not explain its restrained outlook.\n\nAfter hitting 6-year peaks of $1,565 in August, on Comex are holding just above $1,500 now, accruing a gain of 17% on the year versus a previous high of 20%. , which reflects trades in bullion, is hovering just under $1,500, with an annual gain of 15%.\n\nDisappointment In Fed May Prevent Outperformance, Says TD Group\n\nTD Securities, another Canadian financial institution, also expects the yellow metal to maintain its bullish tilt, although gold longs\u2019 disappointment with Fed cuts may prevent an outperformance.\n\nThe group said in a note:\n\nThe ECB\u2019s \u201cnotion of QE infinity, until inflation \u2018converges\u2019 to 2%, represents a dovish tilt \u2026 and will continue to see rates moving lower amid reach for yield, ultimately supporting gold.\u201d\n\nBut it also said that President Donald Trump\u2019s relentless push for the Fed to outdo its peers in cutting rates was unlikely to see corresponding action. Earlier this week, Trump called officials at the U.S. central bank \u201cboneheads\u201d for their tame rate cuts and praised the ECB on Thursday for \u201cacting quickly\u201d while the Fed \u201csits, sits and sits\u201d.\n\nOverall, TD Securities said that underlying economic weakness, dovish central bank tilt, and shortage of safe haven assets as the negative yielding debt pile surges \u201csuggests the path of least resistance for gold and friends is higher.\u201d\n\nCitihgroup Sees $2,000 Gold In The Next 2 Years\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street\u2019s investment bank Citigroup (NYSE: ) belongs to the school of thought that expects gold to reach for the stars.\n\nGold could hit historic highs and even break $2,000 per ounce in the next couple of years if recession risks and rate cuts continue, analysts at Citi said in a Tuesday note.\n\nThe group upgraded its fourth-quarter target for gold to $1,575, and its 2020 target to $1,675.\n\nIt added:\n\n\"We find it reasonable to consider an increasing probability that bullion markets can retest the 2011 to 2013 nominal price peaks and trade to $1,800-2,000 per ounce by 2021 and 2022, on the back of a U.S. business cycle turn towards slower growth/recession on top of election uncertainty.\"", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: XAU/USD, Citigroup Inc, Gold Futures.
