OxC-beta\u2122 Livestock is a proprietary product shown to be effective and economic in replacing the antibiotics commonly added to livestock feeds. OxC-beta\u2122 Livestock is currently registered and available for sale in the U.S. (GRAS), the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, New Zealand, Mexico and Australia.\n\nAvivagen\u2019s OxC-beta\u2122 Livestock product is safe, effective and could fulfill the global mandate to remove all in-feed antibiotics as growth promoters. Numerous international livestock trials with poultry and swine using OxC-beta\u2122 Livestock have proven that the product performs as well as, and, sometimes, in some aspects, better than in-feed antibiotics.\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThis news release includes certain forward-looking statements that are based upon the current expectations of management.
