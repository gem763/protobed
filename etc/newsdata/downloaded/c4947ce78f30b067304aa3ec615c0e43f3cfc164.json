Wealthily-married lady who lunches Simone (Sarah Kendall, the award-winning comedian who also wrote the show) learns this the hard way, when she is called to the hospital to identify her husband\u2019s body. \u201cWe\u2019d have called you sooner,\u201d says the doctor (Rufus Jones with his patented air of agony as a man caught in a dire situation not of his own making). \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t get the phone out.\u201d The action, by the way, is set in 1988, which makes both insertion and extraction of a mobile even more of a feat than it would be today. Respect all round.\n\nSo begins Frayed, the new six-part series produced by Sharon Horgan\u2019s company Merman for Sky 1. It\u2019s billed as a comedy but for the opening episode \u2013 at least after Jones\u2019 and then Robert Webb\u2019s shining turn as the lawyer who informs Simone that her husband died insolvent \u2013 the gags thin out. This leaves a drama leavened by the blackly humorous moments that arise as the fan of life continues to spray what\u2019s recently hit it all over you.\n\nHer husband\u2019s lies cause Simone\u2019s own to be brought into the light. All the trappings of her gilded life in London \u2013 from yachts to mansion \u2013 are sold from under her. The children are withdrawn from private school and she must return with them to her mother and her childhood home in Australia. Which turns out not to be the spiral-staircased pile on a large farm she had claimed, nor in Sydney, but a deeply ordinary suburban home in depressed Newcastle, a three-hour drive away. Nor did her father die in a plane crash; he wandered into the ocean drunk and drowned. And she has a brother, Jim, whom she\u2019s never mentioned. And her real name is Samantha. Apart from that and her resentful, recovering-alcoholic mother, everything is \u2013 as they were fond of saying in Home and Away at the time \u2013 bonzer.\n\nFrayed: the new comedy that sets out to burst the Home and Away bubble Read more\n\nKendall has deliberately created the antithesis of the world of Summer Bay that was the crucible in which my generation\u2019s image of Australia was immutably formed. Her beachside stretch of New South Wales is full of unemployment, overdosing heroin addicts and homeless men crapping on beaches when you attempt a moonlit stroll. \u201cThe toilets are filthy,\u201d one explains. The poor Antipodeans had to manage without the magic of Thatcherism transforming all, you see, dear children. The Fletchers \u2013 along with everyone on Ramsay Street, who in our minds lived next door to Summer Bay because we had no internet to educate us \u2013 sold us a pup.\n\nSimone \u2013 now Sammy \u2013 lucks out and after an abortive attempt to become a consultant radiologist (\u201cI thought it was someone who consults radiologists\u201d) gets a job with an old schoolmate who is now the local MP Chris George (George Houvardas). He has a sports car with a carphone (\u201cIf you ever want to call anyone \u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s really expensive\u201d) and big, possibly not wholly legal, plans for the town. He also re-introduces her to the former \u201ccoolest boy in school\u201d who was \u2013 we are given to understand \u2013 the Scott to her Charlene, the king-sized prawn to her barbie, the bushfire to her storyline finale and is now the football coach at the local school her children are about to join.\n\nSparks look set to fly, but the first episode was unquestionably a slow burner. Sammy herself is as yet an uncharismatic central figure, and the liveliest characters so far have hardly even amounted to cameo performances. Diane Morgan as George\u2019s Mancunian expat receptionist is underused and underwritten, but it is hard to believe she would have taken the part if that remains true. But there\u2019s certainly enough to bring you back for more to see how Sammy\u2019s new life takes shape. Jim (played with rough verve by Home and Away alumnus Ben Mingay) is a turn, and the immediate and flourishing return to sibling bickering (\u201cMuuuuum!\u201d) when Sammy comes back \u2013 the 20 years since they last met vanishing in an instant \u2013 is a joy, and the undercurrents of unresolved rage and shame between mother and daughter tug at the attention. Not quite bonzer then, but no dag either.", "description": "Samantha has a dream life in London.
