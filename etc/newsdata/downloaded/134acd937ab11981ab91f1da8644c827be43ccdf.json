Kennedy International Airport in New York on September 26, 2019.\n\nMore than 300 former U.S. national security officials signed a statement condemning President Donald Trump\u2019s alleged efforts \u2015 exposed by an anonymous whistleblower \u2015 to extort Ukraine into opening a politically motivated investigation into former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nIn the statement released by the group National Security Action on Thursday night, the officials called Trump\u2019s behavior \u201can unconscionable abuse of power\u201d and commended the House of Representatives for opening an official impeachment inquiry into the matter. They wrote that if the reports are true, Trump\u2019s misconduct represents \u201can effort to subordinate America\u2019s national interests\u2015and those of our closest allies and partners\u2015to the President\u2019s personal interest.\u201d\n\nYou can read the full statement below.\n\nNational Security Action, which is largely comprised of officials who served under former President Barack Obama, compiled the signatures and distributed the statement. National Security Action\u2019s website says the organization seeks to promote American \u201csecurity and prosperity ... through strong principled U.S. leadership\u201d in the world, aiming to compensate for what it calls Trump\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d foreign policy stances.\n\nThe signees of Thursday\u2019s statement included those who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, and civilians as well as retired members of the armed forces.\n\nThey \u201cdo not wish to prejudge the facts or Congress\u2019 deliberative process,\u201d but said that the information already available to the public warrants further investigation.\n\n\u201cThere is no escaping that what we already know is serious enough to merit impeachment proceedings,\u201d the former national security officials wrote.\n\nWith House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s formal announcement of an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, the Trump White House is facing its gravest political threat yet. On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee released the anonymous whistleblower\u2019s complaint to the inspector general, and heard testimony from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nThe whistleblower alleges that several people, including the president, Attorney General Bill Barr, and the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, engaged in an expansive campaign to extort Ukraine for political gain and cover up the evidence.\n\nNatSecStatement Final by Anonymous LGS4Ky on Scribd", "description": "The officials, many of whom served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, say Trump engaged in an \"unconscionable abuse of power.\"", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e37501e00003000748f0d.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
