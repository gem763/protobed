Where should I retire?", "language": "en", "text": "Dear MarketWatch,\n\nMy wife and I live in San Diego but find the cost of living too high. Our ideal retirement place would be a moderate cost of living, small- to- medium-sized city with shopping and so on. We also want a moderate climate, and lower danger of natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. Another requirement would be to stay in the U.S.\n\nAfter selling our home our net worth would be approximately $1 million. My yearly Social Security income is $18,000. Within two years my wife will receive her Social Security of $7,000 a year. (*Editor\u2019s note: Letters are edited for clarity and length.)\n\nDear Fleeing San Diego,\n\nCongrats on the sizable nest egg. That plus your Social Security will likely be enough for you to live somewhere great in America that meets most of your criteria. In fact, I have a few spots in mind for you to consider from different parts of the country. While they might not all be perfect fits \u2014 note that I point out their downsides, like summer humidity or higher crime \u2014 they should meet most of your needs and lead to a fun, good-weather retirement. And we\u2019re opening up the comments section below so readers can make their own suggestions to you, too. Good luck on your retirement adventures!\n\nWondering where to spend your golden years? Email Catey at chill@marketwatch.com with your wish list, and she\u2019ll recommend spots for you. Plus, look for MarketWatch reader suggestions below.\n\nWinston-Salem, North Carolina\n\niStock Winston-Salem, North Carolina skyline\n\nThis college town (it\u2019s home to the prestigious Wake Forest University) \u201cblends the past and the present nicely, creating a pleasant and low-key place,\u201d Fodors writes \u2014 with U.S. News noting that though it is \u201ctraditionally Southern in its friendliness, it has an international feel.\u201d And Where to Retire magazine recently highlighted the city, writing that though Winston-Salem gets overshadowed by popular hot spots like Asheville, it \u201chas caught the attention of many folks looking for a vibrant, affordable New South city with a climate that involves minimal snow-shoveling and 100-degree days.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in many ways Winston-Salem, which has a population of roughly 240,000, offers the best of both worlds: A small-town, know-your-neighbors feel with plenty of shopping, golf, arts, restaurants and more. On the shopping front, you can find everything from a large mall (Hanes Mall has about 200 stores) to local boutiques, antique shops and galleries in spots like the Downtown Arts District.\n\nAnd speaking of arts, this town delivers, with Southern Living writing that it has a \u201cthriving arts community.\u201d It is home to the well-known University of North Carolina School of the Arts, art museums, a symphony, a film festival and more. On the dining front, \u201cyou\u2019ll find restaurants serving everything from traditional North Carolina barbecue to Indian curries and Greek pastries,\u201d U.S. News highlights. And Annette Fuller, the editor of Where to Retire magazine, adds that is has good hospitals.\n\nWinston-Salem comes with a cost of living that is below average for the U.S. with median homes prices coming it at under $150,000. However, Winston-Salem does have its downsides, getting more rain that average in the U.S., and the area has been hit with tornadoes in the past (here is your risk of natural disasters).\n\nBy the numbers: Winston-Salem\n\nPopulation: 240,000\n\nMedian home price: $136,500\n\nAverage January low/July high: 28F/88F\n\nSource: Sperling\u2019s Best Places\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\n\niStock Panoramic image of the Albuquerque skyline.\n\nThis midsize, multicultural city is perhaps best known for its annual hot air balloon festival and as the setting for the hit show \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d but it\u2019s got far more to offer than just that (which is one reason Travel & Leisure put it on its list of best places to travel in 2018).\n\nFor one, the arts offerings are strong: There are hundreds of galleries and art studios, monthly arts crawls where you can see the works of local artists, and a robust performing arts scene with performances at spots like the New Mexico Philharmonic, Keshet Dance Company and the National Hispanic Cultural Center. Plus, you can hop over to nearby Santa Fe or Taos, which are also known for their arts scenes.\n\nYou\u2019ll also find all the shopping you could ask for here, from malls to independent boutiques selling everything from contemporary art to Southwestern jewelry. (Check out one of the four major shopping districts in the city, from Old Town to Nob Hill to Downtown and Uptown.) And there is \u201cincredible Southwestern food,\u201d says Where to Retire\u2019s Fuller.\n\nThe weather in this high-desert location has some big pluses (300+ days of sunshine, low humidity and a fairly low risk of many extreme weather issues), but we will admit that December and January temperatures can be pretty cold (in the mid-20s), you will see some snow and there is wildfire risk in the state. Plus, the crime rate is high, though Where to Retire\u2019s Fuller, points out that there is \u201cmuch less crime in the areas where active-adult communities are.\u201d (This map shows you the safer and less safe neighborhoods.)\n\nThe cost of living and property tax rates are slightly below average, according to Sperling\u2019s Best Places, and the outdoor offerings are strong too: Hiking and biking trails abound in the nearby Sandia and Manzano Mountains, where you can enjoy gorgeous pink sunsets.\n\nIf you\u2019re a biker, this city might be particularly appealing to you: Sunset Magazine named the Paseo del Bosque Trail \u2014 16-mile trail that looks out onto the Rio Grande \u2014 one of the 10 best bike trails in the West, adding that you should not miss \u201cthe Rio Grande Botanical Garden, a 20-acre desert oasis that includes a butterfly pavilion and is bordered by the world\u2019s largest cottonwood gallery.\u201d\n\nBy the numbers: Albuquerque\n\nPopulation: 557,000\n\nMedian home price: $196,800\n\nAverage January low/July high: 24F/92F\n\nSource: Sperling\u2019s Best Places\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMedford, Oregon\n\niStock A colorful pot of flowers line the downtown area of Medford, Oregon.\n\nThis small city just north of the California border is one that MarketWatch wrote about as being one of the 10 best spots to retire if you want good weather (it gets less rain than many parts of Oregon). And it\u2019s got far more to recommend it than just mild climate.\n\nFor one, it\u2019s got a plethora of outdoor options. There are more than two dozen parks in Medford, and Southern Oregon offers gorgeous hiking options. Among the hikes not to miss: Table Rocks, a series of gorgeous cliffs formed over seven million years ago from a volcanic explosion, and the Sterling Mine Ditch trail, which is great for seeing wildflowers and birds. You\u2019ll also enjoy other outdoor pursuits like fishing and golfing. And you\u2019re just 20 minutes from Ashland, which offers excellent restaurants and a popular Shakespeare Festival.\n\nWhile you won\u2019t get quite as many shopping options as the larger towns on this list, you aren\u2019t without good choices (see this description here) in this town of over 75,000 residents. That includes everything from the Rogue Valley Mall to independent boutiques and artsy shops.\n\n\n\nAnd if you like wine, you\u2019re in luck: This area is an up-and-coming wine region and artisan food scene. The San Francisco Chronicle recently noted that the area has \u201csome legitimately impressive wines\u201d and highlighted five of the area wineries that you don\u2019t want to miss, including Cowhorn Winery, a biodynamic vineyard that \u201cdelivers articulate, dialed-in, Rhone-inspired wines that speak quite well for themselves.\u201d\n\nHowever, the cost is higher than average for the U.S., but only slightly, with median homes under $300,000. Plus, property taxes are reasonable, there is no sales tax in Oregon, and Medford has an international airport. Still, some may be put off by the lack of diversity in Medford.\n\nBy the numbers: Medford\n\nPopulation: 79,200\n\nMedian home price: $279,000\n\nAverage January low/July high: 31F/90F\n\nSource: Sperling\u2019s Best Places", "description": "Wondering where to spend your golden years?
