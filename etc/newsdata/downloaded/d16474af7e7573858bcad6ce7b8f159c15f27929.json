Among other reforms, Moreno also announced this week that he would withdraw from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) so that Ecuador would no longer be beholden to that cartel\u2019s production limits, increasing oil supply and thus driving down the price of gasoline without government spending.\n\nTransportation professionals \u2013 drivers of buses, taxis, and trucks \u2013 led citywide strikes in the capital Quito, and Guayaquil, the nation\u2019s economic hub, to protest the gasoline price increase, which would adversely impact their businesses. The strikes rapidly turned into chaos as protesters threw Molotov cocktails, burned tires, and blocked major roads. Businesses also reported looting and vandalism.\n\nEcuador's president declares state of emergency following nationwide protests over elimination of fuel subsidies that have been in place for 40 years pic.twitter.com/myFZnbazI4 \u2014 TRT World (@trtworld) October 4, 2019\n\nEcuador decreta el estado de excepci\u00f3n ante las protestas por la eliminaci\u00f3n de los subsidios a los carburantes. @fabriciovelav (@radiomajestadfm) informa de la situaci\u00f3n https://t.co/MZXqfIi8bW pic.twitter.com/hs72uQ1RUA \u2014 24h (@24h_tve) October 4, 2019\n\nMoreno published a state of emergency decree on Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cRights are demanded without hurting that which is fundamental for the progress of the nation: work, education, and freedom of mobility,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe guarantee citizens\u2019 security, free movement, and protection of their property\u201d:\n\nLos derechos se exigen sin perjudicar aquellos que son fundamentales para el progreso del pa\u00eds: trabajo, educaci\u00f3n y libre movilidad.

Moreno\u2019s declaration stated that the strikes against his economic policies \u201calter the public order, impede the normal circulation of traffic, [and] provoke situations of manifest violence that put at risk the security and integrity of people.\u201d\n\nThe decree strips Ecuadorian citizens of the right to free assembly, giving police the authority to break up any group of people who appear to be preparing for violence. There is no curfew; Ecuadorians do not have the right of free assembly for 24 hours a day.\n\nThe Ecuadorian military, now deployed throughout the country to keep relative normalcy for civilians and businesses, will be offering transportation to those attempting to get to work and complete errands in lieu of the regular transport services that are on strike, Quito also announced.\n\nMoreno agreed to a deal with the IMF this year to boost Ecuador\u2019s languishing economy with a $4.2 billion loan. In exchange, the IMF demanded the imposition of austerity measures to cut the lavish government spending that had become a norm during the years of Moreno\u2019s predecessor, socialist Rafael Correa. Moreno ran his 2017 presidential campaign as Correa\u2019s handpicked successor, but quickly abandoned most of his policies and his government has issued a warrant for Correa\u2019s arrest. Correa is currently in exile in Belgium.\n\nThe IMF supported Moreno\u2019s proposed reforms in a statement published Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe reforms announced yesterday by President Lenin Moreno have as their objective improving the resiliency and sustainability of the Ecuadorian economy and creating solid and inclusive growth,\u201d the IMF statement read. \u201cThe announcement included important decisions to protect the poor and most vulnerable, as well as to generate employment in a more competitive economy.\u201d\n\nTaxi and bus drivers\u2019 unions responded with outrage to the end of the gas subsidy, which would take more money out of their pockets in the short term. Some drivers began using their cars to block roadways in protest, according to the country\u2019s El Tel\u00e9grafo, and were joined by leftist student protesters. When police arrived, protesters began to \u201churl rocks and burn tires,\u201d the newspaper noted. The violence forced businesses to shut down in Quito.\n\nThe Red Cross condemned protesters for violence against emergency personnel, publishing a video on Twitter showing protesters throwing blunt objects at an on-duty ambulance.\n\n\u201c[Red Cross Ecuador] rejects the aggression of those we have been victims of in the last few hours against humanitarian staff lending pre-hospital aid in our ambulances,\u201d the organization said on Twitter. \u201cWe are neutral, impartial, and independent\u201d:\n\nCOMUNICADO| @cruzrojaecuador rechaza las agresiones de las cuales hemos sido v\u00edctimas durante las \u00faltimas horas en contra del personal humanitario que brindaba atenci\u00f3n prehospitalaria en nuestras ambulancias. \u00a1SOMOS NEUTRALES, IMPARCIALES E INDEPENDIENTES!#NoSomosUnObjetivo pic.twitter.com/2dvxmzaqxD \u2014 CRUZ ROJA ECUADOR (@cruzrojaecuador) October 4, 2019\n\nMoreno traveled to Guayaquil on Thursday night to declare that the chaos was over, and thank Ecuador\u2019s police and armed forces for subduing the rioters. He accused the transit workers of \u201clittle seriousness\u201d in attempting to dialogue with the government and condemned rioters for attempting to \u201cdestabilize a democratically and legally constituted government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese coup plotters, as always, we will say no to, Ecuador is saying no to them, so they had better assess the consequences\u201d:\n\nHe venido a Guayaquil para evitar que quienes saquearon al pa\u00eds lo sigan haciendo desde otras instancias. Los focos de violencia se han controlado casi totalmente gracias a @FFAAECUADOR y @PoliciaEcuador. Quienes violen la ley deber\u00e1n ser detenidos. #NoAlParo #DecididosACrecer pic.twitter.com/etxjeSeESj \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno (@Lenin) October 4, 2019\n\nAs of Friday, police and military units arrested 275 people and counted 28 police officers injured. Interior Minister Mar\u00eda Paula Romo described the state of the country on Friday as one of \u201cnormalcy,\u201d which law enforcement will continue to maintain in place for the next two months. The government also announced the controversial arrest of the head of the transport union leading protests, Jorge Calder\u00f3n, on charges of paralyzing public transport. Local reports suggested that residents in Guayaquil were still struggling to find ways around the city given the lack of available transport and heavy military presence.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "President of Ecuador Lenin Moreno declared a 60-day state of emergency on Thursday after transportation workers began rioting.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1173508134-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
