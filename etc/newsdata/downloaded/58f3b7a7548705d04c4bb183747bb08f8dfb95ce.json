It was dismissed, but she escalated it to the Indian Supreme Court.\n\nPandey was among the activists including Swedish teen Greta Thunberg who criticized Germany, France, Brazil, Argentina and Turkey for failing to uphold their obligations to young people under the U.N.\u2019s Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\n\u201cIf we take this matter to the global level, I think that global leaders will not ignore us,\u201d Pandey said at New Delhi\u2019s airport on Thursday after arriving back in her home country.\n\nPandey spoke passionately about her experience in New York. She said people often tell her she is too young to be an activist, \u201cbut I am not wrong, because 15 other children are asking for the same . from different countries.\u201d\n\nShe said the best parts of her trip were filing the complaint and then attending a global climate strike last Friday. There were protests in several Indian cities including New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata that day.\n\nPandey is from Haridwar, a holy city on the Ganges River, which has been extremely polluted her entire life.\n\n\u201cThe government said they cleaned it but it\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. \u201cWe say the Ganga is matha (mother), that Ganga is a goddess for us, and we just pollute it.\u201d\n\nShe said she regularly finds statues, clothes and plastic on its banks.\n\nPandey\u2019s interest in the climate started in 2013, when huge floods devastated Uttarakhand state in northern India. Her father, Dinesh Pandey, a wildlife conservationist, began explaining issues like global warming to her because she asked endless questions about the natural disaster.\n\n\u201cWe (adults) just talk a lot,\u201d said Dinesh Pandey, who accompanied his daughter to New York. \u201cThis is not right. They are betraying the future generations. I am standing with my daughter, and I am proud that my daughter is standing with everyone on the global level in this mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our government is fulfilling all of its Paris agreement (climate) responsibilities,\u201d said Ridhima Pandey, pointing out India\u2019s continuing dependence on fossil fuels. \u201cIt makes me very angry . they shouldn\u2019t concentrate just on development. What will we do with all this development if we are not going to have a future?\u201d\n\nShe pointed to single-use plastics as an area in which ordinary Indians can make a difference.\n\n\u201cIf you want to help, I would say first of all support (our movement), and second of all stop using plastic products,\u201d she said. She marveled at the reusable steel straws that she saw people using in New York.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t use it, companies will stop making it,\u201d she said of plastics.\n\nThe Indian government is expected to announce a single-use plastics ban next week.\n\nPandey is starting her own nonprofit group for climate advocacy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to suffer, because it\u2019s our right to have cleaner water, to live in a healthy environment, to have cleaner air,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they\u201d - governments around the world - \u201care violating our rights.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An Indian girl who was among the 16 young activists filing a complaint at the United Nations accusing countries of inaction on climate change has taken that step before.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Krithika Varagur"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/india_child_climate_activist_07439_c0-256-5851-3667_s1770x1032.jpg?5ae0bf8c20bb4f4157353957623eaa4ec0c134ae", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
