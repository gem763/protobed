If that occurs, they would immediately ask for the court to reconvene and consider contempt proceedings.\n\nThe three campaigners, Dale Vince, the owner of the energy company Ecotricity, Jolyon Maugham QC and the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC, launched a legal action last month asking the court to enforce the Benn act provisions requiring Johnson to seek an extension if he failed to get a Brexit deal passed by 19 October.\n\nQ&A What does the 'Benn act' say? Show Hide The EU Withdrawal (No 2) Act, often referred to as the Benn act, is a law that was passed by MPs in an attempt to prevent Boris Johnson's government leaving the EU without a deal. It specifies that by 19 October the government must have either secured a deal that parliament has approved, or secured explicit approval from parliament to leave without a deal. If neither of those conditions are met \u2013 and if Johnson cannot get his deal passed on 'super Saturday' \u2013 it requires the prime minister to write to the EU to ask for a further Brexit extension. The form of the letter that the prime minister must send is set out in full in the act. The act says the extension should last until 31 January 2020, or longer if the EU suggests. Here is the full text of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019 Martin Belam\n\nThey have sought interdicts, or injunctions, forcing Johnson to honour the Benn act and also asked the court to use its unique nobile officium powers to write that letter on the prime minister\u2019s behalf if he failed to do so.\n\nBut Johnson could also fulfill the terms of the Benn act and avoid any further hearings of the legal challenge if he succeeds in getting a Brexit deal accepted and passed in the Commons and agreed by the EU in time to leave on 31 October.\n\nAidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer for the campaigners, told the court on Monday they accepted Johnson had met the first test of the Benn act by sending the extension letter but he said it remained far from clear whether he would act on an extension offer.\n\nO\u2019Neill said there was an open question whether the prime minister was already in contempt of court by sending a second, signed, letter to Donald Tusk telling the EU he did not believe an extension should be granted.\n\nO\u2019Neill read a transcript of undertakings by Andrew Webster QC, one of the UK government\u2019s lawyers, to the court on 9 October where Webster agreed that sending a second letter that tried to undermine the extension request \u201cwould be inconsistent\u201d with Johnson\u2019s pledges in court to uphold the Benn act\u2019s provisions.\n\n\u201cAt the very least, those words seem to be a very close sailing to the wind,\u201d O\u2019Neill told the court. Carloway said Johnson\u2019s letter to Tusk was \u201ca very carefully written letter\u201d.\n\nCarloway, the lord president, sitting with Lord Drummond Young and Lord Brodie, rejected a request from the UK government\u2019s lead lawyer, David Johnston QC, to throw out the legal action.\n\nJohnston said the prime minister had clearly fulfilled his statutory duties and met his obligations under the Benn act. \u201cThere is no reason for these proceedings to continue,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThe normal course in such circumstances would be to refuse [the request to continue the case].\u201d", "description": "Most senior judge says court needs to ensure PM does not try to block Brexit extension", "authors": ["Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad61fba36ffb8be62bcc9ca917e3301fbb0bfb59/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d700b7e50ae1ec48226f2985e07bd660", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
