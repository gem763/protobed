Not bad, not bad.'\n\nTV host Maria, 41, called the publication of the photographs 'the most embarrassing moment of my life' after the images emerged of her on the beach in Miami on New Years Eve in 2010.\n\nAfter one of her followers tweeted to tell her of the pictures days later she replied: 'No??!!!! Where did u see? Please tell me you're joking.'\n\nAnd she told Huffington Post: 'I finally came out [of the water] and I'm like, \"These people are not stopping.\" I'm like, \"Wow, is Britney Spears behind me? What's going on?\" Oh no, my vagina's out. That's it.'\n\nFarrow's new book, Catch and Kill, details that 'four colleagues said Griffin was known for making lewd or crass remarks in work emails'.\n\nMSNBC president Phil Griffin, left, waved around a zoomed-in photograph of Maria Menounos' crotch in a staff meeting after she suffered a bikini malfunction, according to explosive details in Ronan Farrow's new book. Maria was pictured on a Miami beach in 2010, right\n\nRonan Farrow's new book, Catch and Kill, details that 'four colleagues said Griffin was known for making lewd or crass remarks in work emails'. The book also contains more details of how Farrow was turned away by NBC - his then employer - when he started investigating Weinstein\n\nIt says that in one meeting after Menounos' wardrobe malfunction had been reported he 'waved around a printed page bearing a zoomed in image, smirking, and 'exhaled hard' as he looked at it.\n\nThe married dad-of-two is also said to have forced female producers to join him at a peep show in Times Square while a senior producer on Nightly News in the 1990s, Farrow claims.\n\nFarrow's book Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to protect Predators is scheduled for release on October 1\n\nGriffin has been the president of MSNBC since 2008 and has been with the network since its launch in July 1996. He worked previously for NBC News.\n\nAlong with NBC News President Noah Oppenheim and NBC News Chief Andy Lack, Griffin was known as the 'triumvirate' by those working for Harvey Weinstein because of how often the disgraced producer was calling them following accusations against him, according to Farrow.\n\nNBC News say they 'proactively released' NBC News executives 'limited communication' with Weinstein over a year ago.\n\nPart of a 12-page memo that Lack sent to staffers read: 'Weinstein and his representatives were repeatedly told only that, if and when NBC News was prepared to run a story, they would be given an appropriate amount of time to respond. Because Farrow never had a victim or witness willing to be identified, that became moot.'\n\nFarrow's new book has seen accusations leveled at a number of high profile names, including former Today show host Matt Lauer.\n\nBrooke Nevils claimed that Lauer anally raped her in 2014 while they were covering the Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\nHe strongly denied the notion that any of their sexual interactions were forced, writing a 1,400 word letter to describe the night of the alleged incident and subsequent liaisons they had, including one in his Today dressing room.\n\nIn a statement an NBC spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time.\n\n'That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.'\n\nThe book also contains more details of how Farrow was turned away by NBC - his then employer - when he started investigating Harvey Weinstein.\n\nThe journalist's expose against the disgraced media mogul was published by The New Yorker and helped, alongside a first piece in The New York Times, to bring down Weinstein.\n\nFarrow says he first took the reporting to NBC but that it was vetoed by NBC President Noah Oppenheim.\n\nNBC has said in the past that Farrow's reporting did not meet its editorial standards because he did not have enough women willing to on record to say that Weinstein assaulted them.\n\nDailyMail.com has contacted MSNBC for comment.", "description": "Phil Griffin, 62, left, reportedly\u00a0told others in the room: 'Would you look at that?'
