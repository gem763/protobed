No doubt that the China's Commerce Ministry said its trade team will hold talks with U.S. counterparts in mid-September in preparation for high-level negotiations in early October. But, the Gold futures have been constantly maintaining good strength since last few weeks as the bruising trade war between the world's two largest economies has sparked fears of a global economic slowdown and led to monetary easing by major central banks around the world. I find that the Nifty 50 look ready to take a decisive move before the weekly closing; which seems to be a step out of a \u201cDecisive Zone\u201d from 10,912 to 10,851.\n\nI find that the global equity markets have a vigil eye over the developments in Britain. The British parliament voted on Wednesday to prevent Prime Minister Boris Johnson taking Britain out of the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31, but rejected his first bid to call a snap election two weeks before the scheduled exit. Secondly, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward from a \"highly vulnerable and dangerous\" place and find solutions. Thirdly, Crude, which surged more than 4% in the previous session after strong data from China, opened lower after data late on Wednesday from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed U.S. crude stocks rose last week, against expectations. I find that this changing scenario at international level will continue to enhance volatility in global equity markets during the upcoming sessions.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the heavy build of open-interest in Nifty options, which is going to expire on September 5th, may enhance the volatility before closing; but a step out of this \u201cDecisive Zone will finally decide the further directional move till weekly closing. No doubt that the weekly closing level will define the upcoming direction of Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty.
