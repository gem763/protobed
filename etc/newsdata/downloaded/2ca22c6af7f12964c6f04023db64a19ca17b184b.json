They said other participants in the Oval Office were shocked by the request.\n\nTillerson immediately repeated his objections to then-Chief of Staff John Kelly in a hallway conversation just outside the Oval Office, emphasizing that the request would be illegal. Neither episode has been previously reported, and all of the people spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the conversations.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bloomberg.Com News Articles Trump-Urged-Top-Aide-To-Help-Giuliani-Client-Facing-Doj-Charges"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
