Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., came out swinging against the progressive plan to provide government health insurance for all Americans \u2013 and what has become a campaign mantra for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\n\u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d Klobuchar fired at Sanders, arguing that the plan would remove millions of Americans off their private health insurance. \"And on page eight \u2013 on page eight of the bill it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.\"\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold idea, I think it\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d she continued.\n\nThe line was a response to Sanders' oft-repeated line that he \"wrote the damn bill\" that would move to a Medicare-for-All health insurance system.\n\nMedicare for All means expanding benefits to include dental care, eyeglasses and hearing aids. I know that because I wrote the damn bill. #DemDebate \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 31, 2019\n\nHealth care, and the fight over whether to make adjustments to Obamacare or to scrap it for additional government coverage, has dominated the opening moments of virtually every Democratic primary debate this year \u2013 and it has widely split the field.\n\nKlobuchar has said she wants to build on the Affordable Care Act, and does not support the Medicare for All plan. She favors a universal health care system that would include a public option, but not mandate it.\n\nMore: Donald Trump says he's only going to watch highlights of the Democratic debate\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Democratic debate: Klobuchar slams Sanders' Medicare for All plan", "description": "\u201cAnd while Bernie wrote the bill, l read the bill,\" Sen.
