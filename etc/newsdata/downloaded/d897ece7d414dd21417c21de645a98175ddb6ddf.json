Her statement said the 95-year-old is in good spirits and looking forward to recovering at home.\n\nThis is the third time Carter has fallen in recent months. He first fell in the spring and required hip replacement surgery. Carter fell again this month and despite receiving 14 stitches, traveled the next day to Nashville, Tennessee to rally volunteers and help build a Habitat for Humanity home.\n\nCarter is the oldest living former president in U.S. history. He and his wife, 91-year-old Rosalynn, recently became the longest-married first couple. They surpassed George and Barbara Bush with more than 73 years of marriage.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former President Jimmy Carter is in the hospital again after falling and fracturing his pelvis Monday evening at his home in Plains, Georgia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/jimmy_carter_fall_93604_c0-0-4142-2416_s1200x700.jpg?aa0ac37646fda3f3e902b1cb0d3b3a346846066a", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
