(Photo by Tim Warner/Getty Images)\n\nThe Houston Astros came out swinging in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series, scoring four immediate runs against Tampa Bay Rays starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow.\n\nNow several former major league players are speculating that the Rays right-hander was unknowingly giving the opposition a major edge.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nKevin Frandsen, a nine-year veteran known primarily for his defensive versatility, and Trevor Plouffe, who hit 103 home runs over seven seasons with the Minnesota Twins, both immediately suggested that Glasnow was tipping his pitches in posts on social media.\n\nI had his pitches this Spring Training. Every one of em and it only took an inning. https://t.co/AmZ9cNuuPS \u2014 Trevor Plouffe (@trevorplouffe) October 10, 2019\n\nTo be clear, the suggestion is not that Houston was stealing signs. Instead, the feeling is that Astros batters were able to spot some of Glasnow\u2019s tendencies based on prior performances and then exploited them when their research proved valuable.\n\nTwo other former major leaguers, Preston Wilson and Danny Graves, also got on board with that theory after witnessing how locked in Houston\u2019s batters seemed to be against Glasnow right from the jump.\n\nIt\u2019s a bad feeling when a pitcher is tipping his pitches! Right @CliffFloyd30 @MarlonAnderson8 \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 Danny Graves (@dgravy32) October 11, 2019\n\nHouston opened the game with four straight hits, including a two-run double from MVP candidate Alex Bregman.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen Bregman came around to score later in the inning on a Yuli Gurriel RBI single, he was spotted having an animated conversation with his teammates outside the dugout. That fueled speculation that Bregman may have been sharing some tips on Glasnow\u2019s tendencies.\n\nPlouffe, who began the season with the Philadelphia Phillies, noted a specific outing in spring training where his teammates were able to clearly identify which pitch Glasnow would throw next based on those tendencies.\n\nFor those asking I don\u2019t really remember exactly what it was. @KevinFrandsen picked it up as well so maybe he can shed light. Here\u2019s the box score though: pic.twitter.com/t46JattOL1 \u2014 Trevor Plouffe (@trevorplouffe) October 10, 2019\n\nFrandsen\u2019s point seemed to be that Glasnow made no adjustments to his approach after facing Houston in Game 1 of the series. On that day, Glasnow allowed two runs on four hits over 4\u2154 innings.\n\nThe speculation surrounding Glasnow comes just days after baseball observers believed Clayton Kershaw was tipping pitches against the Washington Nationals. Kershaw downplayed the likelihood of that following his NLDS Game 2 loss, but did notably allow back-to-back home runs in Game 5 to essentially sink the Dodgers season.\n\nGlasnow did recover to escape the first inning with back-to-back strikeouts, but was ultimately pulled after 2\u2154 innings.\n\nOnly the Astros know for sure how much of their success was just pure good hitting on their part. But with hitters privy to more information than ever before, the possibility they are tipping pitches seems to be something pitchers need to be more aware of moving forward.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Was Rays Game 5 starter Tyler Glasnow tipping his pitches against the Astros?", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GXVPOC6QhbZxs.JKz0fd8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/13VQmP3G85NtmWn_3MjRsQ--~B/aD0yNDIwO3c9MzYzMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/69df9f00-ebbd-11e9-b7f0-5f2a7cf3d9f2", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
