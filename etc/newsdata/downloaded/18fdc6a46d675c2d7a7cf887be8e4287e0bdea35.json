Now, however, it is receiving plane-loads of Russian tourists instead. Locals have welcomed the wave of visitors, saying they have brought money and jobs during a deep economic downturn.\n\n1 / 8 Slideshow A couple walks through a park in Heviz, a spa town with a population of 5,000. It recorded more than one million guest nights last year, making it the second most visited destination in Hungary after the capital Budapest. Swimsuits are displayed in a shop window in the town, which benefits from two charter flights that come every Sunday from Moscow to nearby Sarmellek, where a derelict Soviet air base has been converted into a small commercial airport. A woman leans back and enjoys the sun at Heviz's thermal spa. Others swim in the water. A Hungarian man receives a mud treatment in the spa town. Men's suits hang at a luxury clothes shop in Heviz, where businesses have welcomed Russian visitors, many of whom are willing and able to spend big. Shop owner Agnes Kanizsai adjusts a dress at a clothes store. She has seen lots of demand at the high end of the market: \"It has happened many times that we dressed up (a lady) and we wanted to put beautiful ... jewellery on her neck and she said she would only wear diamonds.\" A sign in Heviz advertises Russian-language excursions. Gabor Papp, the town's mayor, said the surge in Russian visitors had helped boost tourism revenue despite the economic crisis.", "description": "A woman floats in the water in the western Hungarian spa town of Heviz.", "authors": ["Bernadett Szabo"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ0p6FqYketAwyr35g6wuTr90De_y2MjsxXw143-8d9hYqINVwsJdOsUKvqiaX-IISJ9REV3ks4bIoZTGXGEEhRw99CDcfslcBKtcy1WvHCjG", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
