The government said in late August that the case was ready for sentencing, after months of delays. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has set a Dec. 18 sentencing date, though it's unclear whether it could be pushed off again.\n\nPowell told Fox News on Wednesday that the Justice Department is currently in possession of Mifsud's phones.\n\nWhen asked whether she thought federal prosecutors would comply with her request, she said: \"I think the prosecutors in our case will look for them, but given their prior responses, I expect them to continue to say they are not relevant.\"\n\nPowell has said that Flynn's case is \u201cnot ready for sentencing,\u201d citing their timeline of receiving necessary files and documents that would be critical to the defense of her client. Powell also claimed in an earlier filing that the government \u201ccontinues to deny our request for security clearances\u201d needed to review classified material pertaining to Flynn, including transcripts and recordings of phone calls that \u201csupposedly underpin the charges against\u201d him.\n\nThe DOJ attorneys have argued, though, that Powell\u2019s requests \u201cseek access to classified information that may or may not exist.\u201d\n\nPowell, however, told Fox News Wednesday that Sullivan, the judge presiding over the case, would not rule on the motion until their hearing on Nov. 7.\n\nMifsud played a prominent role in the origins of the Russia investigation. It has long been suggested \u2013 in court documents filed by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, by Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the media \u2013 that Mifsud was connected to Russian intelligence, though others insist that he was more closely associated with Western governments and their intelligence agencies.\n\nWith regard to the special counsel probe, Mueller\u2019s final report stated that Mifsud told former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to making false statements as part of that investigation and served a short two-week prison sentence last year.\n\nThe false statements were made in January 2017 to FBI agents concerning his contacts with Mifsud. Papadopoulos, in his guilty plea, acknowledged that Mifsud shared the information that Russia could have \u201cdirt\u201d on the Clinton campaign.\n\nPapadopoulos met with several foreign individuals overseas, including Mifsud, and former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer. Papadopoulos told Downer about his meeting with Mifsud, and shared that the Russians potentially had incriminating information against Clinton. Downer later told Americans, which reportedly helped prompt the FBI\u2019s original Russia investigation.\n\nPapadopoulos, though, has suggested that the Downer meeting was part of the plot to lay the groundwork for the Russia probe.\n\nDURHAM INVESTIGATION INTO ORIGINS OF 2016 TRUMP CAMPAIGN SURVEILLANCE EXPANDS ITS SCOPE\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr, earlier this year, suggested that \u201cspying did occur\u201d early on in the Russia probe, and tasked U.S. Attorney in Connecticut John Durham with investigating any potential misconduct in that counterintelligence investigation and any improper surveillance of the Trump campaign in 2016, as well as whether the Democrats were the ones who had improperly colluded with foreign actors.\n\nFox News reported last week that Durham is probing a wider timeline than previously known. It was initially thought that Durham was reviewing the days leading up to the 2016 election through the inauguration. However, based on his findings, Durham has expanded his probe, adding agents and resources, multiple senior administration officials said.\n\nThe timeline has grown from the beginning of the probe through the election and now has included a post-election timeline through the spring of 2017, up to when Robert Mueller was named special counsel that May.\n\nBarr and Durham traveled to Italy recently to talk to law enforcement officials there about the probe and have also had conversations with officials in the U.K. and Australia about the investigation, according to multiple sources familiar with the meetings. The president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, is in Washington on Wednesday for meetings with President Trump.\n\nIt is unclear whether Mifsud\u2019s phones were uncovered as part of Durham\u2019s probe.", "description": "The lawyer representing Michael Flynn\u00a0in the case against the former national security adviser demanded federal prosecutors turn over two cell phones used by a shadowy professor whose role in the Trump-Russia investigation has long been shrouded in mystery.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
