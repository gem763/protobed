We went with the latter, and this new release date allows us to finish everything to our level of satisfaction while also reducing stress on the team\u2019.\n\nThe reference to stress levels is a reaction to increasing controversy across the industry about work conditions and the dreaded \u2018crunch\u2019, where many developers are expected to work extreme levels of overtime \u2013 often with little or no extra pay \u2013 in the final months of a game\u2019s development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat makes this one of the first examples of a company refusing to crunch to get a game finished and openly admitting that\u2019s one of the reasons why it will be delayed.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nSources claim that Naughty Dog\u2019s The Last Of Us sequel will miss its February release date, and Ghost Of Tsushima has been pushed back too.\n\nThe release date was only announced last month but it looks like it could be an even longer wait than expected for The Last Of Us Part 2, as rumours suggest it\u2019s already been delayed.\n\nKotaku claims it has two sources that verify the delay, while yesterday respected analyst Daniel Ahmad hinted at \u2018unexpected news\u2019 coming from Sony \u2018soon\u2019.\n\nThe game was supposed to be out on 21 February, but the rumours suggest it now won\u2019t be released until the spring, which is technically March through May.\n\nAs a knock-on effect Kotaku writer Jason Schreier claims that Ghost Of Tsushima, which Sony had apparently pencilled in for release in the first half of the year, has been delayed until later in 2020.\n\nBTW, Ghost of Tsushima doesn't have a public release date yet, but it'll also be bumped later into 2020 to account for this delay. Don't expect them to suddenly turn it into a PS5 game or anything, but it was originally planned for the first half of the year \u2013 not anymore \u2014 Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) October 24, 2019\n\nWhat is The Last Of Us 2 release date?\n\nIt\u2019s not a very long delay but the February date was one of the few quiet spots in what is an unusually busy first half of the year for major releases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs big a game as The Last Of Us is it will now have to fit itself somewhere in-between Final Fantasy VII Remake (3 March), Watch Dogs: Legion (6 March), Doom Eternal (20 March), Animal Crossing: New Horizons (20 March), and Cyberpunk 2077 (16 April).\n\nOf course, it all depends on how long the delay is for, and whether the rumour is actually true, but everything points towards an official announcement in the next few days.\n\nNone of this is unusual for Naughty Dog games, but it does also push the game\u2019s release even closer to the PlayStation 5\u2019s launch next Christmas.\n\nIt may now be that it will launch after the PlayStation 5 itself is officially unveiled, which could lead to some interesting announcements about backwards compatibility and/or remasters.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: The Last Of Us Part 2 does not have multiplayer, as Naughty Dog hint at spin-off\n\nMORE: The Last Of Us Part II release date is February 2020 \u2013 watch new trailer here\n\nMORE: The Last Of Us Part II update: new footage shown at GameStop managers event", "description": "UPDATE: It's been confirmed that The Last Of Us Part 2 will not now be out until May, as Naughty Dog refuse to give in to the crunch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tlou2_screen_ps4pro_e32018_00002_1528773869_1571933969.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
