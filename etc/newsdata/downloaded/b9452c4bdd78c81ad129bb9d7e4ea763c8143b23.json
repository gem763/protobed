Mbappe knew all the results of the second division in France.\n\n\"Nicolas Pepe is like that. He\u2019s another example of the importance of a player liking football.\n\n\"After a game he watches the whole game again two times, to make himself more perfect.\"\n\nPepe struggled in Arsenal's draw with rivals Man Utd last week, but had a better afternoon in their last clash with Bournemouth .\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nHe set up Arsenal's only goal of the game with an in-swinging left-footed corner onto the head of David Luiz.\n\nAnd Wenger feels there is more to come once Pepe can reproduce the performances he displayed in Ligue 1 last season.\n\n\"I like the player and I thought it was a good decision [to sign him],\" Wenger told OmniSport ( via Goal ).\n\n\"He's not yet completely adapted and you have to give him some time.\n\n(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHe looks a little bit to be playing not with the freedom he did in France at the moment.\n\n\"I see some characteristics of his game, especially off the ball, that don't happen at the moment.\"\n\nBut the Frenchman did warn that Pepe must start delivering soon, or risk losing his place in the starting XI.\n\nHe added: \u201cOn the other hand, I must say we have good young players who can play on the flanks, [and] that he will have a fight to keep his position.\u201d", "description": "The Ivorian winger has arrived to huge expectation at the Gunners but is yet to show why they spent \u00a372 million on him", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542076.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-v-Standard-Liege-Group-F-UEFA-Europa-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
