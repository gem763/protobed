Analysts polled by FactSet had expected a profit of SEK3.76 billion.\n\nSales rose to SEK62.57 billion from SEK55.82 billion, as previously announced, while net sales in September are estimated to have increased by 8% on the year in local currencies.\n\n\"Well-received summer collections and increased market share show that we are on the right track with our transformation work to meet customers' ever-increasing expectations,\" said Chief Executive Karl-Johan Persson.\n\n\"The continued development of more full-price sales and reduced markdowns contributed to a 26 percent increase in operating profit in the third quarter, all while maintaining a high level of activity in our transformation work.\"\n\nWrite to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 03, 2019 02:43 ET (06:43 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
