Sometimes called half-sheet pans, they are half the size of those found in commercial kitchens, which are too big for most home ovens. In this guide, we\u2019ll use the 18-by-13-inch pan as our standard, though the quarter sheet pan, measuring about 9-by-13 inches, is terrific for smaller ovens or kitchens as well as for cooking several ingredients in the oven at once without letting the flavors bleed into one another.\n\nYou can choose a pan that\u2019s either aluminum or stainless steel, but whatever you choose look for a pan with a heavy-duty gauge \u2014 this refers to the thickness of the metal used. The higher the gauge, the thinner the pan: Anything from 13 to 18 gauges will work well.\n\nWirecutter, a product recommendations website owned by The New York Times Company, has a guide to the best baking sheets.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the correlation between a metal\u2019s thickness and its gauge.
