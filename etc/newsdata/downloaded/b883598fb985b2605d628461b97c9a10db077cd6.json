Symptoms, causes, prevention and treatment", "language": "en", "text": "What is Meningitis\n\nMeningitis is an inflammation or swelling of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It can be caused by bacteria or a virus. Symptoms in the early stages can be flu-like, including a fever, headaches, vomiting, nausea and a stiff neck.\n\nThe consequences can be very severe and even life-threatening as the brain and spine are critical parts of the human body. Long term problems arising from a bout of meningitis can include deafness and mental decline.\n\nNow you know: What is influenza?\n\nPrevention\n\nCertain forms of the disease can usually be prevented with Meningococcal vaccines, according to the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection. They advise travellers to sub-Saharan Africa during the dry season and pilgrims to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, as well as travellers to other known outbreak regions to consider getting a vaccine.\n\nBacterial and viral meningitis can be transmitted by droplets via sneezing, coughing or direct contact.\n\nVideo of Meningitis - causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, pathology\n\nTherefore suggested forms of prevention include maintaining good personal and environmental hygiene, washing your hands, covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze, and keeping your surroundings clean.\n\nTreatment\n\nBacterial meningitis is usually treated with antibiotics and sometimes corticosteroids to suppress inflammation.\n\nViral meningitis cannot be cured with antibiotics so doctors will prescribe bed rest, plenty of fluids and pain medication to reduce possible fever.\n\n5 things you need to know about antibiotics\n\nWhy should you care\n\nThe organisms that cause the condition are sometimes already carried by people, but their normal immune system can fight off the infection. The most vulnerable are the very old, very young and the already ill. However, there have been outbreaks on college campuses overseas, leading to cases of multiple students falling ill.\n\nStudents in university should be particularly aware, as sharing personal items such as cups and water bottles and those in communal living arrangements such as dorms can increase the risk of infection.", "description": "The disease is an inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, and can be caused by bacterial or viral infection.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/17b3d680-eb39-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires163958.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
