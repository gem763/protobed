One thing was the size of the family,\" he said.\n\nHe said the king had taken action on his own to deal with the issue and compared the move to reports that the UK's Prince of Wales wanted to \"streamline the Royal Family\".\n\nHe also likened the new role of the five Swedish royals to that of princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who have pursued their own careers.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nSwedish historian Dick Harrison said the decision was likely made to meet the modern needs of the family, explaining that the Royal House had grown larger than it had been in 100 years and that many thought there was no need to pay so many members or to have them available for official duties.\n\nImage copyright Royal Court of Sweden Image caption Among the grandchildren being removed from the royal house are princes Alexander and Gabriel (R), sons of Carl Philip and Sofia\n\nBeing removed from the royal house would also allow the youngsters to \"live ordinary lives\", he said.\n\n\"They don't have to bother with being fenced in. They are made into ordinary people but still members of the royal club,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prince Carl Philip married Princess Sofia at Stockholm's Royal Palace in 2015\n\nHe added that the children, who are still princes and princesses, retained a \"theoretical claim to the throne\" and would likely continue to appear at social gatherings through their titles.\n\nMr Harrison said there was also ongoing controversy about the funding of the royal house in Sweden but that it had not yet focused on the young children. \"The king is preventing a discussion that otherwise would have taken place,\" he said.\n\nSweden is just one of several European countries to have a monarchy, along with the UK, Norway, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium. The traditions and number of people in royal roles vary between countries.\n\nThe move on Monday does not affect the position of the children's parents. Princess Madeleine, Prince Carl Philip and his wife Princess Sofia \"will continue their work in the non-profit foundations and organisations which they have founded or in which they are involved. In addition, they will perform official duties to the extent decided by His Majesty,\" the statement said.\n\nIt noted that King Carl XVI Gustaf and his wife Queen Silvia, and Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel were \"Sweden's highest representatives\".", "description": "The five children lose the status of royal highness and are not expected to perform official duties.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13936/production/_109128108_kungafamiljen_solliden_juli2016_foto_anna-lena_ahlstrm_kungahuset.se.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
