Authorities said some \"50, 60, 70 kids\" saw the fight go down, but most refrained from helping.\n\n\"They videoed his death instead of helping him,\" Detective Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick of the Nassau County Police Department told reporters at a press conference Tuesday, adding: \"This can't go on. Your friends are dying while you stand there and video it. That's egregious.\"\n\nRead more: 50 teenagers stood by watching and recording on their phones as a boy lay dying after a brawl\n\nThe people who knew Khaseen said he never would have demonstrated such callous treatment towards others, and that they were shocked by the social-media videos showing dozens of teenagers recording the brawl.\n\n\"It was like 20ish kids standing [in front] watching,\" one of Khaseen's acquaintances, Anthony Yepez, told Insider. \"Which is what bothers me the most.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Khaseen would always help someone in need\u2026 And only a few people who knew him jumped in to help.\"\n\nLong Island authorities have arrested one suspect and charged him with second-degree murder\n\nYepez said he wasn't particularly close with Khaseen but that the two were friendly and had similar interests.\n\n\"He always seemed like a great kid,\" Yepez said.\n\nPolice said they believed the brawl had started over a girl who had asked Khaseen to walk her home one day. Yepez and Khaseen's family members said they suspect the girl was trying to make her ex-boyfriend jealous \u2014 and it worked.\n\nRead more: 'High school now, it's a whole other level': 7 adults who posed as teenagers for a semester were shocked by how much things have changed\n\nKhaseen's older sister, Kedeemah Morris, told The New York Times her brother was a \"sweet\" and free-spirited boy.\n\n\"Him being so nice, that one good deed that he did got him killed,\" Kedeemah told The Times.\n\nBrother of Khassen Morris, Khaleem, in tie dyed shirt on right, stands with friends and family as they mourn Oceanside, New York teenager Khaseen Morris, 16, during a vigil in front of the strip mall where he was killed on Brower Ave. in Oceanside on September 18, 2019.

Flach's lawyer told Newsday that his client turned himself in to police \"to eventually clear his name\" and \"strongly maintains his innocence.\"\n\nOn Thursday, authorities again urged teenagers or other witnesses to come forward if they have information or videos regarding the brawl and condemned those bystanders who failed to help Khaseen.\n\n\"We can't sit idly by as 16-year-olds expire and bleed out on our streets here in Nassau County,\" Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas told reporters at a press conference.", "description": "Khaseen Morris, 16, died Monday after a brawl outside a strip mall in Oceanside, New York.
