Minutes after the central bank\u2019s ruling body had confirmed last month\u2019s monetary-easing package, which had been fiercely opposed by some eurozone central bankers, Draghi said that \u201ceverything that has happened\u201d since the September 12 announcement had \u201cshown that the decisions were justified.\u201d\n\nYet the big paradox of the Draghi presidency is that he saved the eurozone and delivered growth - not formally in the central bank\u2019s remit - but failed in his only official mission, keep inflation \u201cbelow but close to 2%.\u201d The central bank has missed the target every single year since 2013.\n\nSome will argue on the counter-factual, since both GDP growth and inflation would have sunk if the ECB\u2019s policy hadn\u2019t been so accommodating.\n\nBut others also point out, from opposite sides of the ideological divide, either that the inflation target should be changed, or that the ECB\u2019s official mission should also encompass some concern for economic growth and employment, on the model of the US Federal Reserve.\n\nThe next ECB leadership will be very different than the one Draghi lorded over. Term renewals and a resignation mean that within a few months, four of the six members of the executive board will have been replaced.\n\nChristine Lagarde is taking over as president on November 1, and Ireland\u2019s Philip Lane became chief economist in May. And in the next weeks, Italy\u2019s Fabio Panetta, a central banker, and Isabel Schnabel, a leading German economist, both nominated by their respective countries, should join the board.\n\nThe prospect of Schnabel\u2019s appointment could herald a new era in the debates about monetary policy, which became unusually fierce in the last weeks. A respected academic with a deep knowledge and interest for the eurozone and its problems, she can\u2019t be tagged with either of the traditional \u201cdovish\u201d or \u201chawkish\u201d labels.\n\nThat should help her to both convince German opinion that the ECB is doing its job - she already did this as an economist - and speak her mind on the need to care for growth without throwing fiscal caution to the wind.\n\nLagarde, a lawyer by training, has no experience in central banking and no training in economics. Schnabel will be, alongside Lane, a significant addition to the ECB\u2019s economic brainpower.", "description": "Departing central bank president insists economic developments justify negative rates and resumption of QE", "authors": ["Pierre Brian\u00e7on", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT904_Draghi_ZG_20191024050344.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
