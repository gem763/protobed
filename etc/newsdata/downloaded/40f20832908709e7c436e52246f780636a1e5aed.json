In 1993, Matador Records released Exile in Guyville, which won acclaim for its articulate mix of sexual candor and jibes at patriarchy. Ten years later, when she released Liz Phair on a major label, Pitchfork gave the album a rare 0.0 review, dismissing it as \u201chyper-commercialized teen-pop.\u201d But Phair has never put much stock in typical markers of success. In October, she\u2019ll release Horror Stories, the first of two planned memoirs that forsake rock-star gossip for keen, lyrical ruminations on key moments in her life. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell the truth about ourselves,\u201d Phair writes, but \u201cour flaws and our failures make us relatable, not unlovable.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with something you tweeted earlier this year: \u201cRemind me to tell you about the time I had no idea I had a two-month tour booked until my friend told me over lunch at the Chateau Marmont one day.\u201d\n\nThat really happened. When I\u2019m not working, I safeguard my time to go into a dream state and not have to think about the commercialization of my art or the commodification of myself. I take \u201cLiz Phair,\u201d I put her on a hanger, kind of like Mr. Rogers, and I put her away in a closet. I\u2019m not \u201cLiz Phair\u201d anymore. I become the observer rather than the observed.\n\n[In spring 2018], my friend Caroline had come into town, and we were having lunch. She said, \u201cI\u2019m coming to see you next month in Nashville.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not playing Nashville next month.\u201d She said, \u201cI bought tickets. You\u2019re playing Exile in Guyville in its entirety.\u201d I was like, \u201cWait. What?\u201d\n\nThis cold sweat went through my body. A couple of business calls must have come in and they wanted to book some shows, and I said, \u201cGood, just do it.\u201d No one actually told me when those dates were. It was two months of dates! I have stage fright anyway, and I had to go, in less than three weeks, from not having toured in years to playing the entire record of Guyville. When the tour started, I sobbed on my way to the first gig. I didn\u2019t remember how to be that person. It took a few shows before I could be onstage and not freak out.\n\nThe bifurcation you describe, where the artist is on one side and the public figure is on another, is that a defense mechanism?\n\nYes, against self-consciousness. I can\u2019t be an artist and think of myself as a star. I can\u2019t do the two at the same time. Some people are born with a theatricality that I don\u2019t have.\n\nThe Exile song that pops up in my head most often isn\u2019t one of the famous songs, but \u201cCanary.\u201d\n\nInteresting! That\u2019s one of the more personal songs. It\u2019s very revealing about the simmering repression I lived in, the soup I lived in, before I made music. I had a people-pleasing personality. And my older brother was in trouble so much that I was the designated good child. There wasn\u2019t much room for my resentments and rebellion. That built up until I exploded.\n\nHow did you explode?\n\nI stopped going to class in my senior year of high school. I\u2019d been an almost straight-A student. I remember being in geometry class, and I kept getting 100s. They graded on a curve, and a guy I had a crush on, who I thought liked me, wasn\u2019t doing so well in class. He turned around one time and looked at me with such resentment. He hated my guts.\n\nI felt like there was not going to be a payoff for being a good girl, or being smart, or going to an Ivy League school. I remember thinking, Fuck it, I\u2019m done with this.\n\nYou had an epiphany that being polite and industrious wasn\u2019t going to pay off for you?\n\nOr bring me fulfillment. Let\u2019s throw the complication in here: I had a 15- to 20-year regret period of wishing I\u2019d stayed on the straight and narrow. My life became getting onstage, when I was never someone who should\u2019ve been onstage to begin with. The one thing that I really didn\u2019t want to do became my whole job! And there was no way to get out of it.\n\nLiz Phair on tour for Exile in Guyville at the shuttered music venue Lounge Ax in Chicago, Illinois. Photo: Marty Perez courtesy of Matador Records\n\nOberlin was the best school that would take me after I stopped going to high school. My not going to class senior year was a huge red flag almost everywhere, but Oberlin will take smart kids with emotional problems.\n\nWhat were your emotional problems?\n\nMy brother had problems. So it made \u2026 [sighs]. I don\u2019t want to drag my family through anything, you know? So I\u2019m not gonna talk about it. But that was a stressor that was going on.\n\nWere your parents accepting of your rebellion against upper-middle-class values?\n\nNot at all. My mother went to Wellesley. My dad went to Yale. They\u2019re intellectuals. The life of the mind, literature, theater, the symphony are all very meaningful to them. They had a good life, and they wanted that for me. But because I was adopted, they took a somewhat hands-off approach. Had I been their natural-born child, would they have allowed as much freedom?\n\nOne way to describe Exile in Guyville is as a concept album about a smart young woman who\u2019s desperately trying to please these jerks who don\u2019t deserve her, even though she hasn\u2019t figured that out yet.\n\nThat\u2019s a take that I could see. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t deserve me \u2014 it\u2019s just \u2026 and I still find myself saying to men, \u201cYou\u2019re not listening.\u201d There\u2019s something about the society of men that thinks they have it all dialed in. \u201cWe made this. You\u2019re living in a world we made for you.\u201d\n\nGreat, but we made you. Right?\n\nExile was about believing in my perspective on life, against considerable pressure to conform to their takes on things. It\u2019s about showing them that I can play their game and do all right in it. I felt constrained and invisible, and I wanted to kick their asses. Because you\u2019re right, they were jerks. They acted smarter and more skilled than me.\n\nMy father was an infectious-disease doctor. Death, dying, and illness were things I knew about. It gave me a perspective that music is one of the good things in life. There\u2019s no need to parse it to death. If you like a song you can hear at TGIFs, that\u2019s fine. I was ahead of my time, in that sense. In the \u201980s, there were clear winners and losers. That doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Now there\u2019s more diversity in our culture.\n\nThe Guyville song that brings it into focus for me is \u201cHelp Me Mary.\u201d It\u2019s almost spooky how you predicted the future. \u201cWeave my disgust into fame / And watch how fast they run to the flame.\u201d\n\nVoil\u00e0.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like witchcraft. Did you know fame was gonna happen?\n\nIf you talk to Matador, yeah. I walked in there and said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make you a million dollars.\u201d I had been prepared for what was cool because I dated guys in bands at Oberlin. I looked more na\u00efve than I was. And I wrote those songs in a confessional way, as if I wasn\u2019t making art, when I was. It appeared like I was some ingenue.\n\nA brilliant primitive?\n\nYes. And I wasn\u2019t. I was a sophisticated artist at that point \u2014 but angry and depressed and unhappy.\n\nThere\u2019s a story that you cold-called Gerard Cosloy, who ran the indie label Matador, and said, \u201cYou should sign me; I\u2019ll make you a million dollars\u201d?\n\nI wanted money from him to do a record. John Henderson, who ran the label Feel Good All Over, had been my roommate in Chicago. He heard my Girly-Sound tapes, and I was stuck living at home. He\u2019s like, \u201cGive me $100 a month and you can stay in my second bedroom.\u201d And then he would sort of My Fair Lady me. \u201cListen to this music. Now listen to this.\u201d I spent a lot of time going to see cool bands, standing in the corner and smoking cigarettes, so I\u2019d look tougher and cooler. All the men who mansplained music to me made me better. But Henderson and [producer Brad Wood] were sort of fucking around \u2014 we couldn\u2019t decide if we were going to finish recording the songs.\n\nAnd this is very much me: I said, \u201cWhat phone call do we need to make?\u201d So yeah, I cold-called Gerard and said, \u201cI need money to make a record. You should sign me.\u201d I had one goal: to show these indie-rock boys that I had listened to all the music they gave me, and just because I liked the Police and R.E.M. and Madonna didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t make indie rock. That was my goal, to be like, \u201cShut the fuck up about Green River versus Fugazi. It\u2019s not that fucking hard!\u201d\n\nWhen you said you\u2019d make Matador a million dollars, was it because you saw that there was an unfilled niche?\n\nNo! I thought I\u2019d make a big splash in the indie-music scene. I didn\u2019t know national attention would follow. I wasn\u2019t thinking along gender lines. I wasn\u2019t thinking about branding. Ooh, good girl says dirty things.\n\nGood girl says dirty things is a fantastic concept.\n\nThat\u2019s my brand! At Oberlin, that was part of the activism, that the female voice is the least listened to and carried the least authority. I even sped up the tracks on Girly-Sound to make myself sound even more like a little girl. My theory was, if I say the dirtiest things in the world, but like a little girl, will anyone actually hear it? That was the game I was playing. The person I was as a human being and the person people expected to meet were really far apart.\n\nWhom did they expect to meet?\n\nSomeone taller. Tougher. Scarier.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I take \u2018Liz Phair,\u2019 I put her on a hanger, kind of like Mr. Rogers. I\u2019m not \u2018Liz Phair\u2019 anymore. I become the observer rather than the observed.\n\nWere there also assumptions about how easy it was to get you into bed?\n\nYeah. There was a period when everyone was saying I\u2019d slept with them, and I hadn\u2019t. That seems to be what I remember from my early 30s. And it pissed me off. Who are people going to believe on the witness stand, the girl who\u2019s a blow-job queen, or some guy? I get hit on a lot. Everybody sort of takes a shot.\n\nBecause men think you\u2019re game?\n\nNot just that. It feels like I understand the male mind better than some people. This whole idea that men just want sex, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think they\u2019re actually looking for intimacy. To them, sex equates to a moment when they can step out of their tough masculine mind and be in a really Technicolor vulnerability. I think that\u2019s more what they\u2019re craving.\n\nSo when your indie record Guyville became a phenomenon, was that difficult?\n\nYes. If I\u2019d only had success in the indie world, my music would have been contextualized more accurately. They would have understood a little more of the art project behind it. Rather than thinking that I was literally saying I wanted to be your blow-job queen, you know?\n\nOnce you\u2019re in a wider world, and People magazine picks it up, the nuance is gone. And of course, Matador was like, \u201cKeep going! We\u2019re doing great!\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep up the blow-job songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore blow-job songs!\u201d I was in no way prepared for the attention. I\u2019m shy. I\u2019m not trained or skilled in any of these things, so I was sucking at everything I was doing. Matador was great, but emotionally, I didn\u2019t have any help. Suddenly, the attention was national and my parents knew about it.\n\nWas that a surprise?\n\nI didn\u2019t think they would even hear the record. I believed that only Wicker Park and maybe Brooklyn and the Pacific Northwest would listen to it. I mean, I was also stoned a lot back then. So that explains some of it.\n\nYour parents never asked you to send them a copy of your record?\n\nNo. They were quite disappointed that I was going into entertainment. While everyone else was saying, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d my family was like, \u201cYou said what in public?\u201d Fame is a dirty word in my household. Fame is awful.\n\nSo it\u2019s not that you used the word cunt in a song \u2014\n\nNo, it was that too.\n\nBut mostly, they thought entertainment was dirty and undignified?\n\nYeah. And you know what? The truth is, they were right. [Laughs.]\n\nDid Exile have a cultural impact in the short term?\n\nA lot of people knew about me who never really listened to the record. But, yes. I was someone people could relate to. Because I was more mainstream than the people I was around. More mainstream than \u2026\n\nThe Jesus Lizard?\n\nYeah. And I had been a good girl for a very long time.\n\nYou said you were stoned a lot during this period. Was that to escape?\n\nProbably. When I get high, the world shuts up and I can focus on creativity. I have to write sober, have to perform sober. But when I get high, my guitar playing gets so much more interesting. Where someone else would reach for a drink, I\u2019d reach for marijuana because it would let that creative person come forward. But then I have to finish it \u2014 a song, my book \u2014 while I\u2019m sober.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your guitar playing, which is often overlooked and doesn\u2019t sound like anyone else\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019m very proud of that.\n\nWhat do you do that\u2019s different?\n\nI\u2019m weird. [Laughs.] I pursue wrongness if it excites me. In eighth grade, I learned the basic chords from a really wonderful guitar teacher. I was bored playing Dan Fogelberg and James Taylor, so she said, \u201cIf you bring me in two songs you\u2019ve written every week, I won\u2019t tell your mom.\u201d As a visual artist, I look at the neck of a guitar as a canvas. I like to add jazzy notes or weird, wrong notes. I like dissonance. Brad [Wood] will tell you I lean annoyingly toward jazz. When I perform now, no one hears my actual guitar playing because of all the other instrumentation.\n\nTell everyone else to turn down.\n\nI like the way we sound. I tour for one reason: the fans. I don\u2019t make a lot of money at all because I stage it to within whatever budget we\u2019ve got. I make some money, but not as much as you\u2019d think. If you\u2019re a rock star, you\u2019ve got fun money. I never seem to get to the fun money part, and I\u2019d like to.\n\nWhen you made Funstyle, you were already making fun of yourself as a has-been who\u2019d been forgotten by everyone. And that was eight years ago.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re getting at.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t you released an album since then?\n\nI was going to work with Ryan Adams, and you can guess how that turned out. I stuck around for three years trying to get that done. Up until then, I didn\u2019t want to make a record and tour while my son was in high school. It wasn\u2019t until he left for college four years ago that I really wanted to put a record out. During the puberty years, the teenage years, you have to be around more. That\u2019s when it gets very real.\n\nWhat are you going to do with the songs you made with Ryan Adams?\n\nNothing.\n\nDid you finish any songs?\n\nNo. Started a lot. We kept trying. But he was unreliable, and I wasn\u2019t willing to go along with his process.\n\nWhat was his process?\n\nI\u2019m not gonna go. Sorry.\n\nIn your book, there\u2019s a chapter called \u201cHashtag\u201d where you talk about working with him. You also detail the number of ways you\u2019ve been sexually harassed, both as a woman and as a musician. But I think the chapter says that it\u2019s not only harassment that affects women, it\u2019s less obvious things, like being ignored or discouraged.\n\nThat\u2019s very true. It goes back to being a child: \u201cSit still and look pretty.\u201d You want to have a voice, and if you\u2019re female, they block off your avenues to do that. When I think about #MeToo, I think about my determination to continue forward.\n\nYou also write about Adams, \u201cDid he hit on me and try to get me to sleep with him? Yes. Did I take him up on it? No.\u201d What happened when you didn\u2019t take him up on it?\n\nThat was a sentence that was flagged by my editor, and I\u2019m beginning to see why. That\u2019s nothing. Guys hit on girls all the time.\n\nCan I ask a question? Out of everything in the book, why is the Ryan Adams thing such an interesting topic?\n\nBecause he\u2019s been in the news, and it\u2019s a pithy way to discuss sex and power.\n\nIt worries me. There\u2019s an aspect that ends up being reductivist, and it contributes to the problem rather than solving it. It\u2019s gossip. The real aspect is, can women be heard? Can we work and be equal contributors?\n\nYou\u2019re not the only one singling out Ryan Adams as a hot talking point, and it\u2019s sad. It does need to be talked about, but so do the larger issues.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the Liz Phair album \u2026\n\nI want to talk more about Funstyle! [Laughs.] Nobody ever asks me about it. I love listening to those joke songs. I listen to Funstyle more than a lot of my other material. Those songs aren\u2019t gonna help you with your emotional problems. It\u2019s what we did in the studio when I was scoring television so I could stay home with my son. Funstyle was an example of me meeting plug-ins, which are effects you can use to manipulate sounds, like a filter on Snapchat. You can\u2019t help but want to fuck around with them.\n\nLiz Phair was an album some Guyville fans hated because you tried a mainstream sound. When you were co-writing with the Matrix, the production team who\u2019d worked with Avril Lavigne, what did they show you about how to write a pop song?\n\nPop songs are written very fast, which was a surprise to me. The lyrics had to be broad \u2014 I was always trying to put in specifics, and they\u2019d allow a few. But the language and the concept have to be broad.\n\nI get a big high out of throwing myself into something new. As my mom said, \u201cOh, great, something else you\u2019re not qualified to do.\u201d If there\u2019s something I\u2019m not qualified to do, it\u2019s a sure bet I\u2019ll jump right in and do it. I didn\u2019t consider Liz Phair the same as Whip-Smart or Whitechocolatespaceegg. I can compartmentalize. None of this is me. If you want to know me, come see my visual art. Meet me when I was 9. \u201cLiz Phair\u201d isn\u2019t me, so what does it matter if I\u2019m co-writing?\n\nIsn\u2019t Whitechocolatespaceegg a precursor to Liz Phair \u2014 a little bit of a warning that you would leave indie rock? With \u201cShitloads of Money,\u201d it\u2019s like you wanted to start scaring people off.\n\nNot really. If you listen to Girly-Sound, what do you hear? The songs are ridiculous. They\u2019re talking about money, about spending, about pop culture. The inconvenient truth, which no one wants to deal with, is that I was that person when I was doing Girly-Sound.\n\nThe anomaly was Guyville! My manager said, \u201cI want to know why you change styles so much.\u201d True me is me and a guitar. Anything else you put on it is an outfit, whether it\u2019s an indie-rock outfit, a mainstream outfit, a plug-in outfit, a co-write outfit \u2026 Maybe I\u2019m a little bit too adventurous for my own branding good. But that\u2019s what you fucking pay us for! This is what kills me. You pay us because we create realities for you. We create visions. And no one ever claps for that. They want it to be confessional, like it just dropped out of my ass. I should be paid for my ability to create what doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m really good at.\n\nWhen we consider your career as a whole, would it make sense to forget about music and consider you like you\u2019re a visual artist?\n\nI think like a visual artist, but I\u2019m aurally heavy \u2014 a lot of my information about the world comes in through my ears, probably because I had very bad eyesight when I was young and had to sonar my way around.\n\nMy theory was, if I say the dirtiest things in the world, but like a little girl, will anyone actually hear it? That was the game I was playing.\n\nYou need three things in art. It needs to be true to your soul. It needs to be resonant in the greater culture so a lot of people feel it. And it has to show a window into a future realm \u2014 to punch a hole so we can follow into a new way. Those are the things I\u2019m always searching for and failing to find, most of the time.\n\nPeople talk about your two Capitol albums as sellouts. Did it at least work? Did you get paid?\n\nI got a big check when Matador signed to Atlantic. And then when they went to Capitol, I got another big check. I made a good chunk off touring Liz Phair, which was hard-earned. I think it\u2019s impressive that I\u2019ve been able to keep a career going.\n\nHaven\u2019t you ever had the experience, as a fan, of hearing your favorite band change styles and make an album you hate?\n\nYeah. Skip that one. Go to the next band. It\u2019s no big deal. If you invested so much of your identity in someone else, you\u2019re not doing enough work on your identity. You\u2019re giving away too much power to a band.\n\nI feel like we\u2019re talking around Meghan O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2003 review of Liz Phair.\n\nYeah. The [review that called me a] sellout. She pissed me off because I thought she was taking cheap shots at me as a woman. I don\u2019t believe that even if I were 70 and wearing something hot that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. I want 70-year-olds to feel hot! You get a certain number of years on this planet, and you should have sex the whole time and party when you want.\n\nWhat she did was like a real public shaming. [She said] it was shameful and I was a terrible mother for doing that. I say, give me more freedom while I\u2019m here on this earth. Meghan ought to try wearing some hot clothes and having a good time. She might be happier. With record reviews, I don\u2019t even mind, if you write it well. I\u2019m kind of proud Pitchfork gave me a 0.0 for Liz Phair. But she was literally trying to shame me to not be sexual as a mother, and to make me feel sorry for trying to reach a broader audience.\n\nMim Udovitch wrote a Slate review that really summarized the reaction. She said the album didn\u2019t represent \u201cthe artist that Liz Phair fans thought they knew.\u201d People thought they knew you.\n\nThey didn\u2019t. They never did. I think they do now. I\u2019ve been more open, more myself. But you can\u2019t have ownership over a band. I have never gotten mad at a band. Ever. I do not relate to that.\n\nThat album was the first to come out after your divorce and your move from Chicago to L.A. Was the move related to the divorce?\n\nWe both wanted to go to L.A. After we split up, I said, \u201cIf I moved, would you still go?\u201d I couldn\u2019t get enough work in Chicago. There\u2019s a small sliver of pie, and if you get the pie, everyone hates you because they didn\u2019t get the pie. And L.A. has so much pie!\n\nI want to ask about your son, Nick, without being too intrusive about him, and \u2014\n\nHe gets so mad at me! He goes ballistic.\n\nYou wrote \u201cLittle Digger\u201d about him, which is one of the most heartbreaking parenting and divorce songs I\u2019ve ever heard. In the song, you worry whether he\u2019ll be okay. Is he?\n\n[Sighs.] Who knows? He\u2019s gone through some things that were difficult. I expect that when he\u2019s older, he\u2019ll air some of the dirty laundry and say some things that may not be flattering about me. He\u2019s going to be okay, I think.\n\nHe\u2019s proud of that song. But we don\u2019t talk about it \u2014 in his world, I\u2019m strictly mom.\n\nDid becoming a mom change the way you thought about your music?\n\nIt did for a while. You\u2019re listening to different stuff, you\u2019ve got Teletubbies on the television, and that converged with the pop period.\n\nI\u2019d been very self-involved. Oh, you don\u2019t understand what a burden it is that I got successful when I was young. I had all this angst about it. When I became a mother, I had a totally different perspective. I realized it was ridiculous: Oh, you poor thing. Your job is to get up onstage and sing, and people clap for you.\n\nDid motherhood make you more artistically conservative?\n\nNo. I think \u201cH.W.C.\u201d came in that period. Instead of complaining about life, I got more positive, I hate to say.\n\nWhen you were a teenager, who was your \u201cLiz Phair\u201d?\n\nDavid Bowie, who changed all the time. He always was, and still is.\n\nBowie is still in the back of your mind?\n\nSometimes. I just tried to do some Modern Lovers\u2013y songs. I enjoyed going into Jonathan Richman territory. His style of lyricism requires you to say the most embarrassing thing you can about yourself. I\u2019m gonna use him as a muse. All the record labels heard the new songs and were like, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like Guyville.\u201d\n\nPeople literally said that to you?\n\nThey say it all the time. For 25 years.\n\nDo you ever feel like, \u201cFuck Guyville\u201d?\n\nNo, because arguably my whole career is anchored by that record. But in the first ten years, I had a sense of being trapped by it, and fleeing from it. I suffer from moderate claustrophobia. Crowds are hard \u2014 I don\u2019t like being hemmed in. We were in a traffic jam going to see a show at the Greek [Theatre], and I got out of the car and walked. There\u2019s always an exit strategy in my mind.\n\nI was a sophisticated visual artist before I made Guyville. I was working for Leon Golub and Nancy Spero in New York, and Ed Paschke in Chicago. I was really talented. I was doing big, black charcoals about disease and identity. And when I got locked into this Guyville thing, I felt like, Fuck, it\u2019s a trap. Until Liz Phair, I was trying to get out. I will gnaw my own foot off to get out of any kind of trap.\n\nI grew up in fucking Winnetka, the preppiest suburb imaginable, and then suddenly I was identified with this downtown Wicker Park scene. Really? I\u2019m going to cleave off an entire part of myself and live in a world that isn\u2019t even mine? Exile in Guyville. Exile! Guyville was not my home. I wrote the whole fucking record about having trouble living in Guyville, and then Guyville became my home forever? No.\n\nGuyville fans want you to live in Guyville?\n\nTough shit. And I\u2019m not living in Winnetka either.\n\nThere\u2019s now a generation of young indie-rock women who admire or emulate Guyville. Does that give you a sense that the world is changing, and you played a part in it?\n\nI think I have played a part. It was always my aim to \u2026 This is a hard interview. The trouble at home was something I couldn\u2019t talk about, and I still don\u2019t want to. But I want people to say what\u2019s hard and what\u2019s hurtful for them. I want women to feel like they\u2019re not sluts if they want to have sex, and they don\u2019t want it with everyone if they say they want it sometimes. I wanted to change the world in certain ways, mostly for women and largely for myself.\n\nTo be my age now, 52, and see a huge music community of women that didn\u2019t exist when I was coming up is the best fucking thing. If I meant something to them, they mean a hell of a lot to me. It\u2019s why I want to get back out there. My \u201cLiz Phair\u201d now are these young women. They give me motivation, excitement, a sense of safety, and inspiration. Every day I follow a new female artist on Twitter, so I have more of that feeling I was so hungry for back then. Girlville is here.\n\nDo you have a piece of paper? I saw this Venn diagram on a young woman\u2019s Twitter page, the header.\n\n[Phair draws an illustration on a piece of paper.]\n\nPhoto: Liz Phair\n\nI want that on my epitaph. It\u2019s the fucking story of my life. That\u2019s the loneliness I live with, at all times. But all of a sudden I can see them.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve never read you talk about is the period after you graduated from Oberlin and before you moved back to Chicago, when you lived in San Francisco for a while. What did you do there?\n\nI burned through all my savings from summer jobs in three-quarters of a year. I lived in a SoMa loft with my friend Nora Maccoby. Chris Brokaw, who I knew from Oberlin because his band Pay the Man was so good, came to visit Nora. She bugged out, so he and I hung out together. He said, \u201cRecord your songs. Send them just to me, not to anyone else.\u201d\n\nWe did everything wrong in San Francisco. We partied all day long. We\u2019d go out and try to get men to buy us lunches and dinners. We had three outfit changes a day. We\u2019d be high for most of the day, or looking for weed. It was amazing. We tried to do everything on the cheap, so we\u2019d go to a club and tempt men that we would date them, and then not date them.\n\nWhy did you leave?\n\nI ran out of money and moved back home. Get your shit together. Get a job. I sold my art to people for $300 apiece. I had a safety net \u2014 I could go home and do laundry \u2014 but not much of one. My parents were fed up with the dilettante lifestyle I was leading.\n\nI was 22 when I graduated college, and 24 when I made Guyville. It felt like a long time \u2014 a two-year period of aimlessness and temp work, desperately poor, mooching off everybody.\n\nWhere did you make the Girly-Sound cassette tapes?\n\nIt happened over the course of a year. I was desperate to get out of the house, and I would house-sit for friends of my parents who were on vacation \u2014 water their plants, walk their cat, or whatever it was, in exchange for the ability to set up a little home [recording] studio. I\u2019d just spend all day recording these songs, with maybe a Scotch sitting next to me on the floor.\n\nDid you tell anyone you were making music?\n\nNo, not at all. It\u2019s ironic that now I\u2019m known for being frank and open \u2014 my whole career started because I was the opposite of that. I played guitar and wrote songs for years, and would never perform them in front of other people. Maybe that\u2019s why my style is so, what\u2019s the word? Exposing.\n\nI\u2019ll die a cat lady before I ever get in another relationship with someone who\u2019s threatened by my ambition.\n\nIn the \u201cSurf Therapy\u201d chapter of Horror Stories, you talk about being in love with a guy you call Rory, who wants to marry you, but suddenly confesses that he\u2019s just had a kid with another woman. And you write that you were unable to date for ten years after that. When was that?\n\nThat was ten years ago. I date, but I\u2019ve had trouble getting into a solid relationship. I\u2019ve been a serial monogamist my entire life. But the older I get, the harder it is to find a match.\n\nWhy?\n\nThey either like \u201cLiz Phair\u201d and are disappointed by the normal suburban girl, or they like the suburban girl and then are a little threatened by \u201cLiz Phair.\u201d It\u2019s hard to get someone who wants both. I\u2019ll tell you one thing, I\u2019ll die a cat lady before I ever get in another relationship with someone who\u2019s threatened by my ambition.\n\nThere\u2019s also a chapter in your book about having an affair while you were married. How does that square up with the part of you that\u2019s private?\n\nI had a lot of qualms about that chapter. I\u2019d been working on some music. After Prince died, and Bowie, and even Tom Petty, my manager said, \u201cIf this were the last record you ever made, would you want to put it out?\u201d I realized instantly, no.\n\nRight after the Rory episode, I was paralyzed in life. Just crying every night. And I read the Jonathan Tropper book This Is Where I Leave You. He talks about his wife leaving him, and how it felt like a gunshot. That was one of the things that pulled me back to the living. Honesty saves lives. I\u2019ve been saved so many times by other people\u2019s honesty. And I wanted to be that. I wanted to contribute.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in the Whitechocolatespaceegg song \u201cOnly Son\u201d?\n\nThat\u2019s brother. I\u2019m writing from the point of view of my brother. \u201cTable for One\u201d is also written from his point of view.\n\nThe things he expresses in \u201cTable for One\u201d about being adopted \u2014 are those also your feelings?\n\nThey must be. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s spent as much time thinking about it as I have. We come from the same adoption agency \u2014 we\u2019re not related [by blood]. A lot of my problems and his stem from being adopted. There\u2019s a testing of boundaries, like, \u201cWill you love me even if I\u2019m bad?\u201d There\u2019s insecure attachment \u2014 you\u2019re always expecting someone will give you away.\n\nHow awful.\n\nIt is hard. My parents loved us to within an inch of our lives. We had a secure and stable household. We were the disruptive elements. Mom and dad have it dialed in, which can give you a bad complex. You\u2019re like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me that I can\u2019t replicate this nice life?\u201d\n\nAnd you\u2019ve still never tried to find your birth parents?\n\nNo. I have enough people I love, never mind a whole other family I have to check in on. If I could peep into their lives and learn all about them without an interaction, I\u2019d do that instantly. I\u2019m very curious. But I\u2019m not ready, and probably never will be, to interact with them.\n\nYou don\u2019t think meeting them could help you resolve some issues?\n\nNo. Those things formed very young. Having been a mother, if a baby is put into a nice, little warming place and the parent isn\u2019t there for a week or two weeks, that\u2019s a hell of a developmental thing right there. Are you a parent?\n\nI am.\n\nSo you know about those first two weeks of bonding. Even if a nurse holds you, it\u2019s always a different nurse and they don\u2019t hold you all that often. And I didn\u2019t get that bonding. I just sat by myself. I think that does something.\n\nIt also makes me search for who I am. What is love supposed to feel like? What is healthy love? It made me sensitive to the deeper questions because the trauma was probably deep. Who knows, if I had been raised by my birth parents, what kind of a life I would have had?", "description": "A conversation with Liz Phair about being misunderstood; working with Ryan Adams; her memoir, \u201cHorror Stories\u201d; and \u201cExile in Guyville.\u201d", "authors": ["Rob Tannenbaum"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/05-liz-phair.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
