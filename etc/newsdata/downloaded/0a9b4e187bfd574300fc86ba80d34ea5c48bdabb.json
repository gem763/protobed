He is pictured with wife Xochi\n\nPolice have confiscated a shotgun from a fed-up resident who threatened to shoot building works in a village being renovated by a 'Bebo' billionaire.\n\nJohn Heath, 72, says he made the threat after becoming annoyed by noise, vehicles and disruption caused by super-rich Michael Birch in Wooslery, Devon.\n\nMr Birch, 49, helped set-up several social networking sites including Bebo - which he sold for $850 million in 2008.\n\nMr Birch and his wife have since bought the local pub, fish and chip shop, village store, manor house, several properties and 90 acres of farmland in the village of Wooslery.\n\nBut while many villagers have welcomed the investment and the restoration of numerous ageing buildings, others say it has caused far too much disruption.\n\nThe noise and heavy traffic even prompted him to scrawl the words 'Birch out of our lives' in paint on a corrugated tin shed.\n\nMr Heath says he approached someone from Mr Birch's local team and told them he 'felt like shooting the electrics' with his gun to stop the noise.\n\nHe said he made the comments after becoming 'angry and frustrated' with the noise and traffic problems.\n\nThe police were then called and Mr Heath's shotgun, which he has a licence for, was taken away from him.\n\nJohn said: 'I am surrounded by his properties - there's the shop garden to the front, a property next door but one and another properties garden on the other side.\n\n'The problems started about four-and-a-half years ago when he purchased a cottage in Back Street, where I live.\n\n'They dug out the garden to lower it which resulted in about 80 lorries worth of earth being transported down our single track lane. There was noise, constant vehicles outside and the whole house was vibrating.\n\n'The work at the manor has also caused a lot of disruption. Some days people can't get through for all the vehicles and it's resulted in parking problems which have been reported to both the police and parish council.'\n\nThe Woolsery Project declined to comment on the incident. The project employs 65 people - without including the numerous construction workers - 37 of who live in the village, amounting to almost 4 per cent of its population\n\nJohn Heath, 72, says he made the threat after becoming annoyed by noise, vehicles and disruption caused by super-rich Michael Birch in Wooslery, Devon. The village is pictured being renovated above\n\nThe noise and heavy traffic even prompted him to scrawl the words 'Birch out of our lives' in paint on a corrugated tin shed\n\nMr Heath also believes the project is affecting the opportunity for some people to own property in the village.\n\nHe added: 'The buying up of local housing to accommodate staff is reducing the chances of local youngsters getting on the property ladder and staying in the place they were born and brought up.\n\n'It is said that this is to regenerate the village, but Wooslery will not be a village when this development is finally finished, it's going to just be a holiday destination.'\n\nThe issue that brought Mr Heath to the edge of his sanity came when new fridges were installed at the village store.\n\nHe said: 'They have these huge industrial fridges in there and the vibrating can be heard and felt from our house and all hours of the night and day.\n\n'It's affected my sleep and the Environmental Health team have even come along to monitor the situation.'\n\nHe added: 'I didn't threaten anyone, just that I felt like shooting the electrics.\n\n'I have had to go to the doctors for an appointment to get my licence back and they said it was just an act of anger, nothing more than that.'\n\nDevon and Cornwall Police confirmed that Mr Heath's shotgun was confiscated. He is now in the process of reapplying for it.\n\nMr Heath added: 'I have no problem with the development but for those living nearby it has been overwhelming.\n\nJohn said: 'I am surrounded by his properties - there's the shop garden to the front, a property next door but one and another properties garden on the other side. 'The problems started about four-and-a-half years ago when he purchased a cottage in Back Street, where I live'. Back Street is pictured above\n\nWhile many villagers have welcomed the investment and the restoration of numerous ageing buildings, others say it has caused far too much disruption\n\n'The way we have been treated has upset me and some other people as well.\n\n'There are plenty of others who feel this way in the village, I know most of Back Street are unhappy about it.'\n\nThe Woolsery Project declined to comment on the incident.\n\nThe project employs 65 people - without including the numerous construction workers - 37 of who live in the village, amounting to almost 4 per cent of its population.\n\nMichael and his wife Xochi sold Bebo in March 2008 to AOL for around $850 million.\n\nBirch's great-great grandfather, built Woolsery village shop, which remained in the family until it was sold in 1961.\n\nHis grandmother Millicent Andrew was born in the village shop's premises in 1900, and his grandfather Joseph Burrow was born at Ashcroft Farm.\n\nIn a previous interview he said he wanted to act as he had a huge emotional attachment to the village having frequented during his summers as a child.", "description": "John Heath, 72, says he made the threat to shoot building works after becoming annoyed by noise, vehicles and disruption caused by 'Bebo' billionaire Michael Birch in Wooslery, Devon.", "authors": ["Joseph Laws For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/19/19899264-0-image-a-2_1571424926122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
