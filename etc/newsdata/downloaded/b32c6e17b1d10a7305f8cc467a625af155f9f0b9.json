In Europe, that pleasure could soon be denied. Interest rates are dropping ever deeper into negative territory. They will eventually have to be passed on to retail customers.\n\nBanks are wise to hesitate. Charges for basic services will not revive their abysmal profitability. They could damage their business models too. Better for them to tackle glaring structural inefficiencies instead.\n\nEurope has led the US in pushing interest rates lower. But President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars and Fed-bashing could yet result in sub-zero US borrowing costs, too. The European Central Bank\u2019s deposit rate fell last month to minus 0.5 per cent. The Swiss policy rate of minus 0.75 per cent may fall lower still.\n\nCharges on corporate deposits are already common. Wealthy private clients are next. Switzerland\u2019s UBS will from November impose a 0.75 per cent fee on balances above SFr2m ($3m). Germany\u2019s Commerzbank is mulling a similar move.\n\nSo far ordinary customers have been shielded. Mitigating action by central banks is one reason for this. The ECB\u2019s tiering of its charges for banks helps those with excess liquidity, especially in Germany. That lessens the urgency for billing retail clients.\n\nBanking is a free good for economic, not philosophical, reasons. Capital flight is a risk. Start-up online banks could undercut incumbents. So, too, could safes and mattresses \u2014 although the rise of electronic monies offers chances to limit such possibilities.", "description": "Persistently low interest rates have eroded European banks\u2019 margins.
