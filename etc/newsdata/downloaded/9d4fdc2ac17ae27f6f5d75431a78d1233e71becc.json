REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Friday that a lack of progress in implementing agreements made between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un cast doubt on prospects for a future summit, state news agency KCNA said.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has done nothing for implementing the joint statement\u201d from the first summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore last year, KCNA said, quoting North Korean Foreign Ministry advisor Kim Kye Gwan.\n\nThe official criticised the joint military drills between U.S. and South Korea, as well as strengthened sanctions and pressure on North Korea.\n\nNegotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs have stalled since a failed second summit between Trump and Kim in February. Pyongyang has said it is willing to restart working-level talks, but no date or location have been set.\n\nTrump said on Monday that he would want to know what would result from a third summit with Kim before agreeing to hold it.\n\nThe official\u2019s statement also pointed out that \u201cpoliticians in Washington are obsessed with\u201d the assertion that North Korea can get access to a bright future only when it abandons its nukes first, and the view that sanctions led North Korea to dialogue was \u201ctwisted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis makes me doubt whether a new breakthrough could be brought about in the DPRK-U.S. relations though another DPRK-U.S. summit talks may open,\u201d the statement said, using North Korea\u2019s official name, Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\nHowever, Trump is \u201cdifferent from his predecessors in political sense and decision,\u201d Kim Kye Gwan said, and so he would like to place hope on Trump\u2019s \u201cwise option and bold decision.\u201d", "description": "North Korea said on Friday that a lack of progress in implementing agreements made between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un cast doubt on prospects for a future summit, state news agency KCNA said.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434307826&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P235", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
