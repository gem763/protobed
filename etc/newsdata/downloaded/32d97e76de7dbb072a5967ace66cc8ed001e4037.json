One of those towns was Dunkirk, which is just 40 miles from the port of Calais where smugglers are known to prey on migrants seeking entry to the U.K.\n\n\u201cThis is a shocking tragedy. We express our deep condolences to the families and friends of the victims,\u201d the Chinese embassy in London said on Friday, adding that it expected the U.K. side would respect the dead and \u201cconduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation.\u201d\n\nREAD: Everything we know about the 39 dead bodies found in a truck outside London.\n\nHowever, Chinese state media were less flattering toward U.K. officials, criticizing them for failing to prevent a repeat of the 2000 tragedy when 58 Chinese stowaways died in a truck traveling by ferry from Belgium to Britain.\n\nIn an editorial headlined \u201cThe U.K. must bear responsibility,\u201d the state-run Global Times said: \u201cImagine what thorough measures European countries would take if dozens of Europeans died in the same way? Let me ask Britain and the European government why they failed to avoid a similar tragedy after the Dover tragedy? Did they take all the serious remedial action that they could have?\u201d\n\nCover: Police escort the truck, that was found to contain a large number of dead bodies, as they move it from an industrial estate in Thurrock, south England, Wednesday Oct. 23, 2019.
