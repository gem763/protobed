'It's something I'll always remember, particularly as I'm a United fan,' he says with a smile.\n\nAlex Tettey spoke exclusively to Sportsmail about his memories of beating Man Utd in 2015\n\nTettey's second half strike saw Norwich pull off a stunning 2-1 win over United at Old Trafford\n\nCameron Jerome put Norwich ahead back in 2015 before Tettey struck the winner late on\n\n'It was an amazing day. Our team talk was to get through the first 15 minutes and then get forward when we could. Cameron Jerome put us ahead, then I saw my opportunity to break and get a second.\n\n'You can't always outplay big teams but when you can hit on the counter, hit them. We knew that United team weren't in great shape so if we could get something going, we'd have a chance.'\n\nThe parallels to this afternoon's game at Carrow Road are obvious. Despite a narrow midweek success in the Europa League, Solskjaer's United haven't won an away game in the Premier League since February and sit deep in the bottom half of the table.\n\nTettey faces a Man Utd side on Sunday who face similar problems to those they had in 2015\n\nThough Norwich have also found it tough following promotion and have a crippling injury list, they do have the precedent of a stunning 3-2 win over Manchester City to inspire them.\n\nManager Daniel Farke has youth and the goals of Teemu Pukki at his disposal, but the experience of 33-year-old Tettey is vital.\n\nThe Ghana-born Norway international, who joined Norwich in 2012, suffered a muscular injury last month that coincided with his side's poor run. But he returned last weekend to help pick up a useful point at Bournemouth, starting the match in midfield and ending it in central defence.\n\nFacing United is always the most special date in his calendar. 'Growing up in Norway, I'd always go to the pub with my dad to watch their games,' he said. 'Andy Cole, Teddy Sheringham, David Beckham. I still support them now, when they don't do well, I'm like any other supporter, 'Oh, come on'.'\n\nAs for Solskjaer, Tettey is well aware of the popularity at home of his fellow Norwegian. 'He was always famous but it's gone crazy since he's been the United manager. People like him because he was a striker for Man United but stayed humble. 'I don't recall much about playing Cardiff but I do remember bumping into him and his agent in our team hotel because that's where he was living as well.'\n\nTettey is now Norwich's longest serving player having joined the club back in 2012\n\nLike many African-born footballers, the sacrifices Tettey made in early life are hard to comprehend for those who had a more orthodox childhood.\n\n'My dad left when I was very young to seek a better job in Europe. He travelled first to Germany, then to Norway and my mum raised three kids on her own in Accra in Ghana. When I was 12 my dad brought me and my sister to Norway. My mum didn't come \u2014 it would have been too cold.\n\n'I'd seen pictures of my dad and talked on the phone. I wouldn't say exactly he was a stranger at the start, but very close to a stranger.'\n\nSadly, Tettey's mother died on August 25, the day of Norwich's defeat by Chelsea. 'I am still trying to process it,' says Tettey. 'The funeral is next month and I will travel back to Ghana.'\n\nTettey's football career with small-town clubs Rosenborg and Rennes helped him settle in the relative geographical outpost of Norwich.\n\n'When I first heard about Norwich from my agent, I was like 'OK', because I knew they were in the Premier League. But I didn't know where the city was,' he says.\n\n'It is perfect for me though. There hasn't been a moment when I thought Norwich didn't give me what I required in life. It's also the best place to bring up children.'\n\nThe football has provided enough drama. Tettey has been through five different managers and a yo-yo existence between the top two divisions.\n\nHe catalogues his bosses. 'Chris Hughton brought me here, fantastic, you couldn't wish for a better guy to talk to. Neil Adams was a good guy. Alex Neil will go on to achieve a lot of things, a young manager who knows a lot. Alan Irvine made you feel so calm.\n\nTettey has described Norwich boss Daniel Farke as 'demanding' but praised his methods\n\n'And now, Daniel Farke. I didn't know anything about him when he came. But we needed a manager who was demanding, with his own way of doing things.\n\n'With him, you know if you get picked in the team, you've earned it because he demands a lot.'\n\nYou're also likely to bump into the occasional famous face at Carrow Road with former Chancellor Ed Balls and actor Stephen Fry both fans who have sat on the board.\n\nThere is also TV chef and majority shareholder Delia Smith of 'Let's be 'avin' you' fame. 'Delia is always around,' says Tettey. 'If I'm injured, she'll come over, 'Oh Alex, when are you back, we need you'. It's fantastic to have owners who care about the club so much.'\n\nTettey is in the final year of his contract at Carrow Road. Whatever happens, he is already a Canaries legend, just like Duncan Forbes, who passed away last week and will be honoured today with both sets of players wearing black armbands.\n\nThe perfect send-off for Forbes would be for Norwich to end a run of one point from 12 since slaying City. Tettey is crossing his fingers midfield rival Paul Pogba doesn't make it back from injury.\n\n'If he gets the ball and has three targets ahead of him, he can hit any of them; left, right or through passes,' he says. 'They are pushing to get him back but I hope he doesn't play against us.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY JOE BERNSTEIN: Alex Tettey will not be a welcome sight for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United as they try to halt their slide down the Premier League table", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/23/20227720-0-image-a-6_1572127868175.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
