That\u2019s fast enough to download a movie in under a minute.\n\nSpaceX launched in May the first batch of 60 operational satellites into low Earth orbit and plans to launch another 60 in November from an Air Force station in Florida.\n\nShotwell said the program, part of a $28 million Pentagon contract awarded to SpaceX in late 2018, is ongoing and expects to test Starlink with \u201ca number\u201d of additional military aircraft types. That contract also includes testing communications between satellites in orbit.\n\nThe U.S. military is increasingly dependent on satellites to determine what it does on the ground, guiding munitions with space-based lasers and satellites as well as securing such assets from satellite-jamming technology from Russia and China.\n\nThe head of the new U.S. Space Command, General John Raymond, told reporters in September that he visited SpaceX\u2019s Starlink factory in Redmond, Washington, but did not go into details about the Pentagon\u2019s plans.\n\nStarlink is competing with Softbank-backed OneWeb, which aims to give millions of people in remote and rural areas high-speed internet beamed down from space and has already launched a batch of six satellites. Raymond said he also visited OneWeb\u2019s new satellite production line in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\n(This story has been refiled to fix spelling of megabits in paragraph 4)", "description": "The Air Force is using SpaceX's fledgling satellite network to test encrypted internet services for a number of military planes, the space company's president said on Tuesday, detailing results for the first customer of Elon Musk's planned constellation of thousands of broadband-beaming satellites.", "authors": ["Joey Roulette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443900458&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L22G", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
