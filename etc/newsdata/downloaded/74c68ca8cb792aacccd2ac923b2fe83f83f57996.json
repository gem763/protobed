They\u2019re not very masculine, they\u2019re slightly ageing and they have lots of feelings of inadequacy. Delta males \u2013 it\u2019s a term that\u2019s very relevant to a lot of people in my life.\u201d\n\nIn State of the Union, the 39-year-old star of The IT Crowd and Bridesmaids plays just such a character. Tom is a London-based Irish music critic made redundant by the rise of social media. His last active engagement with the world was to get British citizenship in order to vote for Brexit and thereby annoy his wife\u2019s Guardian-reading remoaner friends.\n\nHis wife Louise, played by Rosamund Pike, has his number. \u201cYou were out long before Brexit,\u201d she says. \u201cFriends \u2013 out. Marriage \u2013 out. Life \u2013 out.\u201d He\u2019s withdrawn from everything, but saddest of all from sex, crashing out with no deal into unsplendid isolation.\n\nAbout to air on BBC Two, this unexpectedly funny, sweet and touching Emmy-nominated series, written by Nick Hornby and directed by Stephen Frears, takes place over 10 weeks, each 10-minute episode unfolding in a pub in Hammersmith, London, as the pair steel themselves for weekly couple-counselling. They\u2019ve started therapy because Louise had a brief, regretted affair. \u201cIn an ideal world,\u201d she tells Tom. \u201cI\u2019d only want to have sex with you.\u201d But this isn\u2019t an ideal world. At night, instead of making love, he scorns her choice of bedtime reading: \u201cHow many Scandinavian women are there left to kill?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018My mum really enjoyed it\u2019 \u2026 O\u2019Dowd, whose mother is a psychotherapist, with Rosamund Pike in State of the Union. Photograph: Marc Hom/SundanceTV\n\nTom is a man in arrested development, a theme Hornby has been writing about for decades in books that became films: the obsessed Arsenal fan of Fever Pitch, played by Colin Firth; the list-making record-shop geek of High Fidelity, played by John Cusack; the kidult of About a Boy, played by Hugh Grant.\n\nBut most of all, Tom is a reworking of the role O\u2019Dowd played last year in the film Juliet, Naked. His Duncan was professor of television studies who microanalysed The Wire for a living and was besotted with the lame oeuvre of a 90s indie rock star played by Ethan Hawke. No wonder his long-term girlfriend, portrayed by Rose Byrne, was so bored with their relationship.\n\nWhile O\u2019Dowd was funny, some felt the character he played was cartoonish and his predicament too fanciful to be believed. State of the Union is much more nuanced. Tom\u2019s no cipher and Louise is as culpable as him for their problems. You probably know a couple like them. You may even be them.\n\n\u201cI mean, she\u2019s Rosamund Pike, so she could clearly do better,\u201d says O\u2019Dowd self-deprecatingly, speaking by phone from California. \u201cBut could she be bothered?\u201d Actually, what\u2019s more likely is that Louise wants to rebuild a connection with the man with she loved and whose conversation she enjoys: their dialogue sparkles throughout, even as it expresses all their pain and resentment. \u201cI think that\u2019s right. These guys are better together.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sad-eyed basement geek \u2026 with Katherine Parkinson and Richard Ayoade in The IT Crowd. Photograph: Contract Number (Programme)/CHANNEL 4 PICTURE PUBLICITY\n\nWho will watch State of the Union? \u201cAnybody who\u2019s ever been in a relationship,\u201d says O\u2019Dowd, who was born in County Roscommon, Ireland, but has lived in LA for 10 years. \u201cThe interesting thing about it being short-form comedy is that one of the biggest audiences will be commuters. It\u2019s just the thing to watch on your phone for 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nIf Hornby\u2019s males are often boys trapped in men\u2019s bodies, his women are rarely so confined. Byrne played a museum curator, Pike is an NHS gerontologist (someone who studies ageing). In Hornbyland, women do grownup jobs while the men remain disappointing scions of the patriarchy, piggybacking on their spouses emotionally and, in State of the Union, financially.\n\nO\u2019Dowd believes that women aren\u2019t the only losers in a patriarchal society. \u201cI feel a lot of men haven\u2019t benefited either. I know that men have coasted too long in power \u2013 but come on! Having to be aggressive? Despising showing your feelings? All that\u2019s hopeless.\u201d Men will benefit from the #MeToo movement, he says. \u201cTo be elevated above our protective side is going to be really good for men. Equality is going to be great for everybody.\u201d\n\nIrish prosperity and peace are going to be completely usurped by Westminster \u2013 again\n\nCharm itself, O\u2019Dowd only gets cross once in our interview. With many Britons trying find enough Irish ancestry to qualify for a passport with a harp on it, Tom may well be the only Irish person who opted to become British to back Brexit. Is he like Tom in that respect? The line goes rather quiet.\n\n\u201cIt seems oddly fitting to the people of Ireland,\u201d he says finally, \u201cthat Brexit is coming down to the backstop. The suggestion that the British government is making \u2013 that they won\u2019t fuck us over \u2013 is laughable. That\u2019s what they have done for 800 years. People growing up in Britain won\u2019t have much sense of that. Their history books don\u2019t really dwell on the depraved way Britain has treated its closest neighbour. What do I think will happen? Irish prosperity and peace are going to be completely usurped by Westminster. Again.\u201d\n\nOtherwise O\u2019Dowd is very much like Tom, a delta male struggling towards middle age. \u201cI\u2019m turning 40 very soon. I was thinking the other day, \u2018I\u2019ll be middle-aged!\u2019 And then I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve felt middle-aged for a while.\u2019\u201d This year, he says, has been all about taking stock of his life: \u201cWhat do I want to do with the rest of it?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mob muscle \u2026 with Ray Romano in the TV version of Get Shorty. Photograph: Justin Lubin/AP\n\nHe loved playing sad-eyed basement geek Roy in The IT Crowd with his catchphrase: \u201cHave you tried turning it off and on again?\u201d And he got a Hollywood break as the sweet cop who puts out for troubled Kristen Wiig in 2011\u2019s Bridesmaids. He now has a regular turn in the TV adaptation of Elmore Leonard\u2019s Get Shorty as a mob muscle aspiring to become a movie producer. We will next see him alongside Melissa McCarthy in The Starling, the two playing a couple who have lost a child in what is billed as comedy drama.\n\nWhile he has thrived in LA, O\u2019Dowd is prone to misgivings. \u201cIt\u2019s easy just to follow the work and not think too hard about where you\u2019re going.\u201d He never had huge expectations of his career, but is keen to have \u201ca bit more creative control and more time at home\u201d. He hopes to write again following the success of his book Moone Boy: The Blunder Years, a spin-off from the Sky series of the same name, based on his childhood and filmed in his home town of Boyle.\n\nWhen O\u2019Dowd married the TV presenter and writer Dawn Porter in 2012, she changed her surname to O\u2019Porter. They have two sons, Art and Valentine. He recently tweeted something that Tom could do with taking on board: \u201cMarriage can be tricky and parenting is no walk in the park. What makes both easier is doing them with the best person you know. Happy anniversary my love.\u201d\n\nMaybe the idea that marriage is nothing but a joyous experience is nonsensical\n\nO\u2019Dowd is the youngest of five siblings. His dad Sean is a sign designer, his mum Denise a psychotherapist. What did she make of State of the Union? \u201cShe really enjoyed it \u2013 she saw a lot of very familiar troubles dramatised in it.\u201d Not least the fact that it\u2019s generally the man who is most sceptical about therapy. Upset that their shrink is a woman, Tom says to his wife: \u201cWhy do we have to do all our dirty washing in her launderette?\u201d The shrink\u2019s gender will, he says, make one thing inevitable: \u201cI\u2019m going to get slaughtered.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause of feminism.\u201d\n\nBy the end of season one, Tom and Louise may have worked out some of their problems but I suspect there\u2019s still more than enough material for a second season. \u201cMaybe,\u201d says O\u2019Dowd. \u201cThey both need to be stripped of their illusions if they\u2019re going to have a future together. She wants their marriage to be constant rapture. Maybe this idea that marriage is nothing but a joyous experience is nonsensical. I certainly think it is. The truth is that it\u2019s OK to be unhappy.\u201d", "description": "He\u2019s cracked Hollywood. Now he\u2019s playing a manchild in a warring couples comedy by Nick Hornby.
