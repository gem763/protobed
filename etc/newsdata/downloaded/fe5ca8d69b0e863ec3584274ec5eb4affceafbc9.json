The software maker just unveiled Windows 10X, a new variant of Windows 10 that\u2019s designed to run on dual-screen and foldable devices that are coming in the future, including the Surface Neo. There have been a number of tweaks to the operating system to make it more touch-friendly, but the Start Menu is perhaps the most obvious.\n\nMicrosoft is scrapping its Live Tiles, the animated and flipping icons from the Windows Phone days, in favor of a more simplified look. The Windows 10X Start Menu includes apps you can pin in place, and a list of recent documents. It looks like more of a task launcher than what exists in Windows 10 today.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising to see a new Start Menu on this Windows 10 variant. Microsoft accidentally revealed this exact Start Menu change earlier this year, after an internal version of Windows 10 was distributed by mistake.\n\nLive Tiles were originally part of Windows Phone, and Microsoft added them to Windows 8 in an effort to encourage developers to create apps that updated the information displayed on them. They were designed to be \u201cglance and go\u201d so you could quickly look at the front of a phone and see information, but that didn\u2019t translate well into the Windows 10 Start Menu and not every app even fully supports the animated tiles.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the regular version of Windows 10 will also be updated to include some of these Windows 10X Start Menu changes, but it\u2019s obvious that Microsoft doesn\u2019t see Live Tiles as part of its Windows future anymore.", "description": "Microsoft is changing its Windows 10X Start Menu and dropping Live Tiles.
