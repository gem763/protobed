EU officials said intensive talks had been \"constructive,\" but added further concessions would needed to be made by the British side if the prime minister is to avoid requesting a Brexit extension.", "authors": ["Ashley Cowburn", "Lizzy Buchan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/08/boris-johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
