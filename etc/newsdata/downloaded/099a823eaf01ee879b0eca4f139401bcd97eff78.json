Paul said after entering the Troxy to a chorus of boos. 'Winston Churchill would be ashamed.'\n\n'I might kill this man,' the American continued. He added: \u2018Y\u2019all may not know it but JJ\u2019s on his fifth abortion. His fifth. That\u2019s five babies dead.\n\n\u2018And I think I might return the favour. And I might kill you. I might end you. I\u2019mma light you on fire, bro.'\n\nPaul declared that he 'might kill' fellow YouTube star KSI with a 'first-round decapitation'\n\nHe added to KSI: 'You've got heart, I'll give you that, but that won't matter. I think you know that. You can work as hard as you like, but it doesn't matter. I respect you, but I'm going to have to end you, then I'm going to have to kiss your mom on the cheek, bro.'\n\nAsked for his prediction, Paul replied: 'First-round decapitation.'\n\nKSI, who found fame through his hilarious FIFA video game reactions, was also full of confidence looking ahead to the fight.\n\nKSI did his best to get under his rival's skin ahead of their highly-anticipated rematch\n\n'I have no respect for Logan Paul, I can't wait to finish you off,' he said. 'You used a dead dog for views, a dead guy for views; is there anything you wont use for views? Maybe your career once I'm done with it.\n\n'November 9th you'll see all your boxing ability is going to go out of the window and you are going to be finished. I'm going to finish him, I'm going to make him suffer slowly.\n\n'It's going to be five rounds of you suffering, then in the fifth round I'm going to end you.'", "description": "WARNING VIDEO MAY CONTAIN STRONG LANGUAGE: Logan Paul has declared that he 'might kill' fellow YouTube star KSI with a 'first-round decapitation' in their high-profile rematch.", "authors": ["Spencer Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/23/19416296-0-image-a-54_1570486460174.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
