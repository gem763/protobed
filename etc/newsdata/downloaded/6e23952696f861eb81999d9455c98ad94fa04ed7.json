The final death knell rang the year I could not get the tree into the stand and ended up trying to whittle the trunk with a screwdriver and a hammer. It was time to move to an artificial tree I could manage.\n\nMy first artificial tree rang true to its name. It looked fake from even 3 miles away. Fortunately, tree designers and manufacturers have gotten better at producing more realistic branches and needles. I've gotten savvier at selecting trees and have settled on the proper height and circumference for my living space.\n\nAfter a few years of attempting to wrangle lights onto my artificial tree, I opted for a pre-lit tree. With the selections offered today, you can have lights of any color, special effects ranging from flashing to dimming to changing colors. It is important to look for a pre-lit tree that is labeled \"with burn-out protection\" or \"continuous on.\" This means that if one bulb goes out, the rest of the strand will stay lit.\n\nAfter going through a series of trees, I've gained a bit of knowledge that allows me to help others make a good decision when buying a pre-lit artificial tree:\n\nMeasure the space where you plan to put the tree so you can purchase the height and diameter that works for you. Since artificial trees are so lightweight, you may be able to lift a shorter tree by placing it on a sturdy base (more room for gifts under the tree!).\n\nLook for trees with branches and needles that are molded as one, not attached by wires, to more closely resemble a real tree.\n\nChoose a tree with the highest tip count you can afford. More tips make an artificial tree look fuller and provide more spots to place ornaments.\n\nA higher light count means a brighter tree. A good rule is 100 light bulbs per every 1.5 feet of the tree.\n\nMost artificial trees have a life expectancy of around 10 years. Invest in a tree bag to help protect the tree from dust and insects while it's in storage.\n\nIf you crave the scent of a real tree, skip the artificial sprays and buy a fresh pine wreath or garland to bring the outdoors into your home.\n\nI have seen and researched many pre-lit artificial trees over the years. I'm always looking for the most beautiful, easiest to assemble, and the best value in products for myself and others.\n\nHere are the best pre-lit artificial trees you can buy:", "description": "Pre-lit artificial Christmas trees come in a variety of sizes, colors, and themes.
