We can make it our standard by impeaching and convicting President Trump as soon as possible.\n\nI am aware that our country is bitterly divided on this question. I am aware that many Democrats would impeach President Trump for jay walking. And I am aware that many Republicans would oppose impeachment if the President ran over and killed a jay walker.\n\nTo Democrats in the House, I urge you to shut down all further investigations.\n\nThey are taking up too much of your time. Worse, they are taking too much time of lawyers representing Americans you are calling as witnesses who then get to pay for the unpleasant experience of testifying to Congress.\n\nTo Republicans in the House and Senate, I urge you to imagine how you would feel if a President that did not like the way you vote asked a foreign nation to prosecute you or your family for anything that you can imagine.\n\nIt doesn't have to be legitimate. It simply has to make it more difficult for you to get reelected. You would hate it and you would be right.\n\nI do know from the personal experience of being in the Senate during the trial of President Clinton how partisan these moments can be.\n\nI do know how difficult, divisive and distracting it can be to debate this question.\n\nYou did not choose to enter public service for this purpose. You had other things in mind when you became a candidate for public office.\n\nHe advised that the impeachment of President Donald Trump (pictured) was taking too much of Congress's time\n\nI also know how difficult it can be to answer the question: What did the framers have in mind when they said the Congress could impeach for 'high crimes and misdemeanors'?\n\nThe genius of our founders was using language that gave us Americans the opportunity to debate the meaning of their words and decide our collective course of action.\n\nThat's why I believe strongly we Americans must unite to clearly declare that any President who asks a foreign power to prosecute an American citizen and who offers the assistance of America's chief law enforcement officer must be impeached in the House and Convicted in the Senate.\n\nFor now and into the future this must be our standard. To lower this standard for any reason threatens the stability of our republic.\n\nAccepting this our standard will be most difficult for Americans who like, admire and support President Trump. I hope you can find a quiet, calm place to consider this proposal.\n\nI do not doubt your love for our Country. I do not doubt that your love will help you see that this is something our love of America compels us to do.", "description": "Bob Kerrey, a Democrat who served as a US Senator for Nebraska from 1989 to 2001, says: 'Democrats in the House, I urge you to shut down all further investigations.'", "authors": ["Bob Kerrey For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/19/19309300-0-image-a-80_1570212154399.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
