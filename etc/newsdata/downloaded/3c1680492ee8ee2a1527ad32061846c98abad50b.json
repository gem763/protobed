Sow\u2019s name is not yet marked in the show, but her gaze is already arresting, singular. \u201cYou can watch a documentary and you can say: well, this is too bad,\u201d she says. \u201cBut at the end of the day, it\u2019s just something that you\u2019re watching on TV. And you can turn that off, and you can go about your life.\u201d\n\nLiving Undocumented review \u2013 the families ripped apart by zero-tolerance Trump Read more\n\nSow points to one of the great ironies of immigration coverage under Trump, for those not personally engaged with the system, documented or undocumented: you\u2019re frequently watching, maybe imagining, rarely engaging on a human-to-human level. Living Undocumented, executive produced by the Mexican-American pop star Selena Gomez, seeks to address this detachment, as best as a documentary can, through the focus on individual, day-by-day stories. The series follows eight families navigating life as undocumented people under the Trump administration, whose zero tolerance policy targets all non-citizens \u2013 men, women, children \u2013 in the United States.\n\nAmerica at large has certainly been watching the cruel impact of zero tolerance, which has cyclically dominated headlines since \u201cbuild the wall\u201d became the rallying cry of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Living Undocumented, meanwhile, stakes out a different territory than journalistic documentary \u2013 less necessarily blaring, more personal and sprawling. The series was intended as \u201ca more comprehensive story of immigration, but directly from the immigrants themselves\u201d, the director Aaron Saidman said in an interview with the Guardian.\n\nSaidman and his directing partner, Anna Chai, first conceived of the project in 2017, after receiving footage of the Nigerian chef Tunde Wey, who was detained for months in a Texas immigration facility. Wey\u2019s story \u2013 20 years and an acclaimed culinary career in the US yet still threatened with deportation \u2013 \u201cjust sparked a conversation internally at our production company\u201d, Saidman said. They started to wonder: what other stories were out there? \u201cHow much do people really understand about the complexity of the issue? And is there a series that we could make that would explore all of these different stories in all of their facets?\u201d\n\nSaidman, Chai and their production team began making inquiries, \u201cexhausting all options\u201d, said Chai, to find undocumented people who would participate in filming \u2013 Facebook groups and Twitter, news stories, immigration lawyers and advocacy groups. They deliberately sought a cast from across the US, with different socioeconomic, national and ethnic backgrounds. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been very easy to cast this primarily from people from Mexico and Central America,\u201d said Chai. \u201cBut the immigration situation is not just that. It\u2019s not a border issue; it\u2019s affecting people from all over the world.\u201d\n\nLiving Undocumented thus follows, over the summer of 2018, families from a range of backgrounds: Luis and Kenia, both from Honduras, seeking to be together after Ice detains a pregnant Kenia for deportation; Ron and Karen, who fled violence in Tel Aviv and have raised a family and run a business for 17 years in Los Angeles; Alejandra Juarez, who has spent 20 years in Florida with her husband, an ex-marine and Trump voter, facing deportation to Mexico. There\u2019s Vinny, a Laotian refugee in South Carolina whose regular Ice check-in is likely to separate him from his wife and young daughter. The Dunoyer family, refugees from Colombian narco-guerrillas in San Diego, California, whose two teenage sons, Pablo and Camilo, use social media to draw attention to their case \u2013 a direct result of protections stripped under Trump. Miguel and Maria, Hondurans in Baltimore seeking to be reunited with their 12-year-old niece, detained at the border. Eddie Fernandez, a Mexican immigrant and now businessman in Minnesota, permanently barred from US citizenship because of one false citizenship claim as a teen. And the Sow family, from Mauritania and now Ohio, whose father Amadou is trapped indefinitely in detainment and legal limbo.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Awa Sow in Living Undocumented.

Making the series was a crash course in confusion, said Chai. \u201cEnglish is my first language and I\u2019m lucky enough to have a college degree, and I found it super confusing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deeper that we got into research and the more we started preparing to shoot the show,\u201d Saidman said, \u201cthe more Kafka-esque the immigration system appeared to be and revealed itself to be.\u201d\n\nIn order to show, as Saidman said, \u201cthe immigration system itself, and how complicated and daunting and intimidating that system is for the immigrants who are going through it\u201d, Living Undocumented also features immigration attorneys, advocates and journalists to help contextualize and explain America\u2019s confounding immigration system, from legal asylum to personal stays to deportation hearings. The expert commentary gives the series the effect of an adapted longform article \u2013 personal narrative journey illuminating baffling bureaucracy.\n\nStill, despite the obviously political implications of the show\u2019s stories, Saidman, Chai and Gomez, in an op-ed for Time, maintain that the series is personal in intent and message. \u201cThis was specifically designed to not be a political story,\u201d said Saidman. \u201cThis is meant to be a human interest story where you can get a sense of what these people are really going through.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all hope that this can add to the conversation, and start a conversation about what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not working, what we could do to potentially improve it,\u201d said Chai.\n\n\u201cAs a Mexican-American woman I feel a responsibility to use my platform to be a voice for people who are too afraid to speak,\u201d Gomez wrote in TIME. \u201cAnd I hope that getting to know these eight families and their stories will inspire people to be more compassionate, and to learn more about immigration and form their own opinion.\u201d She wrote that she recently met with Camilo Dunoyer, now in hiding after his father was deported in August, whose greatest fear is not returning to Colombia, but being reduced to a statistic.\n\nIt\u2019s a concern Saidman and Chai said informed the entire intent of Living Undocumented, and the gap in conversation they hope to fill. \u201cPeople respond to personal stories,\u201d Saidman said. \u201cHopefully this series will help accomplish this, that they understand that these people aren\u2019t just statistics.\u201d", "description": "In Netflix docuseries Living Undocumented, executive produced by Selena Gomez, eight undocumented families navigate fear and deportation in the US", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6bc7866aa235f0d81542ea4d48a4c47d45af1ba/251_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eab2d360a0aa071d15c6139a2c28afcb"}
