The Panthers forward is in his eighth season with Florida after a record-breaking 2018-19 campaign. He set the franchise-record for single-season assists with 62.\n\nFlorida's lead was short-lived, when Barber tied the game at 11:23 to set the stage for Belzile's winner.\n\nThis is the 13th year of Hockeyville. The small community of Renous, N.B., won $250,000 for repairs and upgrades to their rink, and the chance to host the NHL game. Because of the high demand for tickets, it was decided to hold the game in the larger venue in Bathurst.\n\nLuongo in the house\n\nRoberto Luongo said he was happy to represent Florida at Hockeyville in New Brunswick, giving him a chance to visit Bathurst where he helped the Acadie-Bathurst Titan win the Quebec Major Junior League championship in 1998-99.\n\n\"It's fun to be back. It's been a while but just to see the people outside and their enthusiasm brings back some great memories,\" Luongo said.\n\nThe 40-year-old announced his retirement in June following a career 489 NHL wins as a goalie.\n\n\"I'm happy with my decision and think it was the right one for me,\" he said.\n\nLuongo said instead of working out all summer, he got to spend more time with family and enjoy a few extra slices of pizza.\n\nTkachuk's late empty-net goal lifts Senators over Leafs\n\nBrady Tkachuk's empty-net goal wound up the winner as the Ottawa Senators held on for a 4-3 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nConnor Brown, Tyler Ennis and Max Veronneau scored for the Senators as they beat Toronto for the second straight night to remain undefeated in the pre-season.\n\nCraig Anderson allowed one goal on 22 shots through two periods before Filip Gustavsson took over in the third giving up one goal on 18 shots.\n\nWATCH | Leafs' Matthews finds the net twice against Senators:\n\nAuston Matthews records 2 goals in pre-season debut but Toronto falls to Ottawa 4-3. 1:20\n\nAuston Matthews, making his pre-season debut, scored twice for the Leafs. Nick Shore also scored while Michael Hutchinson gave up three goals on 20 shots through two periods, before Brandon Halberson allowed two goals on seven shots.\n\nMatthews made it a one-goal game at the seven-minute mark of the third as he won a battle in the slot and batted a puck out of mid-air and past Gustavsson.\n\nThe Senators appeared to ice the game when Tkachuk put the puck into Toronto's empty net, but once again the Leafs were able to make it a one-goal game as Shore beat Gustavsson with 44 seconds remaining in regulation.\n\nPair of quick goals spark Jets\n\nAndrew Copp and Sami Niku factored into a pair of goals 38 seconds apart to spark the Winnipeg Jets to a 4-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild.\n\nCopp took a long cross-ice pass from the Finnish defenceman and fired a high shot past Wild goalie Kaapo Kahkonen 59 seconds into the game.\n\nNiku and Copp then drew assists on Blake Wheeler's one-timer at 1:37 for the 2-0 lead.\n\nWheeler also assisted on defenceman Josh Morrissey's power-play goal late in the third period, while forward C.J. Suess added an empty-net goal with 1:15 remaining.\n\nBackup goalie Laurent Brossoit stopped 20 shots for the Jets, who were playing the first of four exhibition home games. They lost 2-0 to the Oilers in Edmonton Monday.\n\nNico Sturm banged in his own rebound for Minnesota at 8:44 of the third period to make it 2-1.\n\nKahkonen made 18 saves for the Wild and Mat Robson started the third period and stopped 10.\n\nFlames beat Sharks in high-scoring tilt\n\nDillon Dube had a goal and an assist to lead the Calgary Flames to a 6-4 win over the San Jose Sharks.\n\nSean Monahan, Alan Quine, Adam Ruzicka, Derek Ryan and Johnny Gaudreau, credited with an empty netter when Tony Sund accidentally knocked the puck into his own net, also scored for Calgary.\n\nThe Flames improve to 2-1-0 in the pre-season.\n\nManuel Wiederer had a pair of goals for San Jose. Lean Bergmann and Ivan Chekhovich also scored as the Sharks fell to 0-2-0.\n\nConsidered one of the Flames top prospects, Dube got a chance to play on Calgary's top line. With Elias Lindholm sitting out, the 21-year-old lined up on his off wing, alongside left-winger Johnny Gaudreau and centre Sean Monahan.\n\nDube took advantage of the opportunity early. On his third shift, it was his touch-pass that sprung Gaudreau into the Sharks end and he slid the puck over to Monahan, who buried a wrist shot into the top corner.\n\nDube then scored a slick goal himself in the second period, although not with his high-profile line-mates. Halfway through a line change, Dube was set up in front by journeyman forward Byron Froese, and on a neat move to his forehand, he tucked the puck behind Antoine Bibeau making it 5-3.\n\nIt was a tough night for the two goaltenders. Bibeau and Jon Gillies, both 25, and with a combined nine years of AHL experience already, do not figure to be part of their club's NHL plans for 2019-20.\n\nBibeau made 16 saves, as did Gillies.", "description": "A short-handed goal by Alex Belzile with less than five minutes to play lifted the Montreal Canadiens to a 4-3 pre-season win over the Florida Panthers Wednesday night in the 2019 Kraft Hockeyville game in Bathurst, N.B.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5289260.1568857916!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hkn-panthers-canadiens-20190918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
