Many wonderful candidates,\" he said.\n\nTrump, who has made cracking down on legal and illegal immigration a signature issue of his presidency and 2020 re-election effort, said he and McAleenan had \"worked well together with Border Crossings being way down.\"\n\nDespite the praise, Trump never formally nominated McAleenan to run the agency.\n\nIn a statement, McAleenan said during his six-month tenure DHS had \"made tremendous progress mitigating the border security and humanitarian crisis we faced this year.\"\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said this week that arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border fell in September for the fourth month in the row.\n\nIt said there were just over 52,000 migrants either apprehended or encountered at the southwest border in September, down almost 65% from a peak in May of 144,000.\n\nThe bulk of arriving migrants are from Central America, many of them families, fleeing situations of violence and poverty at home and often seeking asylum in the United States.
