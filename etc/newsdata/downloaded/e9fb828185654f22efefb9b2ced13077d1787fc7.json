(Reuters) - A Chinese woman accused of hoodwinking U.S. Secret Service agents to gain illegal entry to President Donald Trump\u2019s Florida resort repeated her assertion that she \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d as her federal court trial was handed to a jury on Tuesday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club is shown ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., August 31, 2019. REUTERS/Joe Skipper/File Photo\n\nThe actions of Yujing Zhang, 33, at Trump\u2019s private Mar-a-Lago club in March sparked concerns that she might have been a spy, although she was charged only with trespassing and making false statements. Prosecutors have offered no explanation in court for her motives.\n\nThey focussed instead on trying to prove she used deception to gain unlawful access to private property.\n\nZhang, who prosecutors said was carrying multiple electronic devices when arrested, insisted she was entitled to admission to Mar-a-Lago because of a contract for which she had paid $20,000 to attend a U.S.-China economic development event at the resort.\n\n\u201cI made a contract to go to Mar-a-Lago and see the president and his family, and I do think it is the fact that I did nothing wrong,\u201d she told jurors in halting English as she delivered a brief summation of her defense on the second day of her trial.\n\nZhang took the unusual approach of serving as her own lawyer for the proceedings, with a public defender assigned to her in court acting as a legal adviser.\n\n\u201cI did not lie,\u201d she said. \u201cI went into Mar-a-Lago and had a visit, and that is what I wanted to say. Thank you.\u201d She delivered a similarly succinct denial of wrongdoing in her opening statement on Monday.\n\nIn closing arguments for the government, Assistant U.S. Attorney Rolando Garcia countered that Zhang had been notified in advance by the company sponsoring the event that it had been cancelled and that she had demanded her money back. He cited electronic messages retrieved by the FBI from her cellphone.\n\nRolando also detailed how Zhang allegedly bluffed her way through Secret Service and resort security checkpoints onto the club grounds in Palm Beach, Florida, in part by passing herself off as the relative of an actual club member of the same name.\n\n\u201cShe was bound and determined to get on that property,\u201d Rolando said. \u201cShe knew she wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d\n\n\u2018WEIRD AND STRANGE\u2019\n\nThe trial in a federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale was recessed for the day after U.S. District Judge Roy Altman instructed the 12-member jury. The panel was due to begin its deliberations on Wednesday morning.\n\nFront-desk Mar-a-Lago receptionist Ariela Grumaz testified earlier on Tuesday that Zhang \u201cwas acting very weird and strange\u201d during her March 30 visit.\n\nThe Chinese national ignored a \u201cno filming\u201d sign and, using her cell phone, captured video of the ornate lobby as she strolled inside, raising suspicions and prompting Grumaz to urge security personnel to watch her.\n\nZhang, wearing an evening dress in the early afternoon, began texting on her cell phone and Grumaz asked her to leave. She calmly walked outside and was immediately surrounded by Secret Service agents.\n\n\u201cThat is what struck me. She was totally in control,\u201d Grumaz told jurors.\n\nZhang, who at times appeared bewildered during her trial, faces up to six years in prison if convicted.\n\nShe had four cellphones, a laptop computer, an external hard drive device and a thumb drive in her possession at the time of her arrest, the Secret Service said in a court filing. Initial examination of the thumb drive determined it contained \u201cmalicious malware,\u201d the Secret Service said.\n\nA subsequent search of Zhang\u2019s Palm Beach hotel room reportedly uncovered a device meant to detect hidden cameras and nearly $8,000 in cash.\n\nTrump visited Mar-a-Lago the weekend Zhang was arrested but was playing golf during her time at the property.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry has said it had no knowledge of any connection between Zhang and the Beijing government and was leaving it to U.S. authorities to \u201chandle the case in accordance with the law, fairly and appropriately.\u201d", "description": "A Chinese woman accused of hoodwinking U.S. Secret Service agents to gain illegal entry to President Donald Trump's Florida resort repeated her assertion that she \"did nothing wrong\" as her federal court trial was handed to a jury on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Erik Bojnansky", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428431519&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8914Q", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
