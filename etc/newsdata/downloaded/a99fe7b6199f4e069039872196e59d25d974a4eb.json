It\u2019s not known what triggered the relapses. In some cases, patients had resumed vaping. It\u2019s also possible that initial lung damage made patients more vulnerable to other illness. Another possibility, she said, is that treatment with steroids, which many clinicians have been using to care for such injuries, may \u201cset you up for increased infection risk.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCDC did not reveal exactly how many cases of relapse have been reported, but Schuchat said they are aware of fewer than five such cases among the 1,299 that have been reported. At least 28 people have died in the vaping-related outbreak.\n\nA 17-year-old male from the Bronx who died from vaping-related injuries Oct. 4 had been hospitalized twice. He was first hospitalized in early September and readmitted later that month. New York officials reported his death Tuesday. New York health officials are investigating the products he vaped.\n\nIn Utah, there have been two cases where patients were readmitted after they resumed vaping, according to Dixie Harris, a pulmonologist and critical care physician with Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City. The health system has cared for more than 60 cases. Both patients resumed vaping and \u201cthey ended up with surgery and significant lung complications,\u201d she said. To protect their privacy, she declined to provide additional details.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDoctors and officials are particularly concerned about the young people who have fallen ill. Eighty percent are under 35 years old, and 15 percent are under 18. Of 80 patients under 18 for whom CDC has complete clinical information, 56 required intensive care and almost one in three needed mechanical ventilation to breathe, Schuchat said.\n\nIn many cases, doctors say, teenagers have told them they vaped as a way to deal with stress and anxiety. Doctors said those underlying problems need to be addressed.\n\n\u201cI think we miss the boat if we treat the lung disease and then send them home to high risk for recurrence,\u201d said Anne Griffiths, a pediatric pulmonologist at Children\u2019s Minnesota who has personally treated about half of the two dozen cases at the pediatric hospital and reviews all the state\u2019s vaping-related cases. Some of the teens have told doctors they rely on vaping THC to help them sleep, she said. \u201cMy response to them is, if you are sedated, that\u2019s not the same as healthy sleep,\u201d she said. The bottom line, she said: \u201cDischarging children home after this lung injury without counseling or therapy or addiction management, I think, is a big mistake.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo help clinicians better diagnose and treat these cases, the CDC released more specific guidelines Friday. The guidelines emphasize a close follow-up of patients because some with only mild symptoms experienced a rapid worsening within 48 hours. The CDC is also recommending that health-care providers strongly advise patients to stop using e-cigarette or vaping products. For those with addiction to nicotine or THC products, patients should consider cognitive behavioral therapy and consultation with addiction medicine services, the guidelines state.\n\nWith the start of flu season, the CDC is also stressing the importance for health-care providers to ask patients about their use of e-cigarette or vaping products \u201cin a nonjudgmental way.\u201d Vaping-related injuries and respiratory viral illnesses, such as influenza, have similar symptoms: cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. In the vaping-related cases, nearly 80 percent also have gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea, officials said.\n\nOfficials still don\u2019t know the cause of the injuries. Schuchat said there may be more than one cause. The most recent data confirms earlier information that most patients used products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCDC on Friday backed away from its earlier, broader recommendation against using all vaping products and narrowed its recommendation instead to warn individuals against using e-cigarette or vaping products that contain THC, especially those bought off the street.\n\nBut a small proportion of patients have reported exclusively using nicotine-containing products, and many people with these lung injuries have reported combined use of THC- and nicotine-containing products. The CDC said that agency officials cannot exclude the possibility that nicotine-containing products play a role in this outbreak.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has collected over 725 samples from roughly half the states with reported cases. But the agency\u2019s forensics lab in Cincinnati has only been able to initiate testing for about 300 samples because many samples contain little or no liquid, said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. Of 225 products tested that contain THC, nearly half contained vitamin E acetate, a cutting agent used to stretch the amount of THC in vape cartridges, he said. Experts in the legal marijuana industry have said vitamin E acetate has been used on the marijuana black market because it is colorless and odorless, has similar viscosity to THC oil, and is much cheaper.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVitamin E acetate, which is sold legally, is commonly used as a nutritional supplement and in skin-care products. It\u2019s not harmful when ingested or applied to the skin. But health officials have warned it could be hazardous when inhaled, potentially causing the sorts of symptoms many patients have reported: cough, shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The relapses are a disturbing new development in the ongoing national outbreak that has spread to every state except Alaska.", "authors": ["Lena H.
