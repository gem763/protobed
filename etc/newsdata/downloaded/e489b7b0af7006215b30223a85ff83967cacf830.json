The index is on track for a 1.2% decline across the week, after a 1.2% gain the week previous.\n\nMiners are a noticeable drag on the UK index following dismal reading from China. Economic growth in China slowed to just 6%, the weakest level in almost 30 years, putting on full show the impact of the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute.\n\nDominating the upper reaches of the FTSE are the no-deal Brexit vulnerable stocks, such as the house builders and domestically focused banks as investors look ahead to tomorrow\u2019s Parliamentary Brexit vote.\n\nThe is proving to be neither a help or a hindrance to the FTSE on Friday.
