After this you can then save up to a maximum of \u00a3200 each month.\n\nThe idea is that you then use the money you build up to purchase your first home.\n\nAnd as long as the property costs no more than \u00a3450,000 in London, or \u00a3250,000 elsewhere in the UK, you will receive a 25 per cent bonus on top of what you have saved.\n\nThe maximum bonus you can earn is \u00a33,000 on savings of \u00a312,000. The minimum is \u00a3400 so you need to build up at least \u00a31,600 in your account.\n\nIf you are planning to buy with your partner, you can each open an account and qualify for up to \u00a36,000 in bonuses.\n\nYou can continue saving into your Help to Buy Isa until November 2029 after which time you have another 12 months to claim your bonus.\n\nInterest rates are low at around 2 per cent or 2.5 per cent as the big attraction is the tax-free top-up.\n\nAnother small stumbling block with the scheme is you can\u2019t use the bonus as part of the deposit you put down on your home.\n\nThis is because the Government does not pay out the bonus until you complete the buying process.\n\nAt the deposit stage, you normally need to put down about 10 per cent of the house price.\n\nIf you tell your solicitor from the start you are relying on your Help to Buy bonus Isa for the down payment, they may be able to negotiate the deposit down to 5 per cent.\n\nBest rates come from small building societies such as Penrith at 3 per cent, Vernon at 2.85 per cent and Newcastle at 2.56 per cent, but the accounts are on offer to local residents only.\n\nAmong the big providers, Barclays pays 2.58 per cent and NatWest, Nationwide and Virgin 2.5 per cent \u2014 worth \u00a332 interest a year on savings of \u00a3200 a month.\n\nFirst-time buyers who miss out on a Help to Buy Isa still have the chance to save with the newer Lifetime Isa.\n\nThese too pay a 25 per cent government bonus if you use the money to buy your first home or to put towards your retirement.\n\nBut the accounts are more complicated than the Help to Buy Isa, and only a handful of providers offer them. They could suit those who can afford to save more than \u00a3200 every month.", "description": "For, this type of Isa will be withdrawn from sale on November 30.
