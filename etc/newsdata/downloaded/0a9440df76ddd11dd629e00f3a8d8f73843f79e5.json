A human-sized \"classic grey\" alien model stood in the lobby, the cardboard creature\u2019s silver boots being sporadically nuzzled by a tortoiseshell cat. About 10 Kaokala members wearing swirly galaxy design shirts overloaded sofas, nodding as Wassana discussed her 21-year relationship with beings from beyond.\n\nThere was much detail to digest, such as how the aliens don\u2019t have defined sexes, and eat just energy capsules \u201cbecause they have small mouths.\u201d I didn't see a hint of a wink or nod among the group members present, whose ages range from their 20s to 60s. The 50 or so people comprising the core Kaokala group, plus thousands following them online, take aliens seriously. This is because rather than destroying us, Independence Day-style, the Kaokala group believes they\u2019re planning to save us from annihilation.\n\nWassana, 47, dedicates her life to listening to her ET pals and awaiting their plans to save mankind, but recently the conversation was rudely interrupted. Last August the sacred rural location the Kaokala group used to channel the aliens\u2019 messages was raided by local authorities.\n\nThe Kaokala members were forced to regroup, but were keen to take me to the scene of the raid to show me that they\u2019ll survive the setback. After all, the fate of our species depends on it. \u201cI want to inform the public that aliens will be here for people on Earth,\u201d said Wassana, under the black-eyed gaze of a painting of two grey aliens.\n\n*\n\nWassana and her sister Somjit Raepeth, 60, claimed to have been communicating with aliens from Pluto and a planet named Lokukatapakadikong since 1998. According to them, aliens from Lokukatapakadikong are your standard humanoid large-headed greys: super-intelligent The X Files sorts. Those from Pluto aren\u2019t in solid form: they\u2019re more like gas.\n\nTwenty-one years ago, out of the blue the sisters\u2019 father claimed to have received alien contact whilst meditating. Initially sceptical, they tried meditating alongside him. \u201cMy father received the wave and it passed to me\u2014it was like a phone line being switched,\u201d Wassana said. \u201cI felt a kind of \u2018motivational energy\u2019 pushing me.\u201d\n\nUkrin Thaonaknathiphithak by a lake near Khao Kala mountain.

The sisters heard how ETs wanted to speak to humans so they could one day provide them with technology to survive this, before forging a \"new generation\" of humans. This inspired the duo to build a community of believers to help get the message out.\n\nDespite the unlikeliness of their yarn, their straight-faced sincerity proved convincing. After gaining traction by word of mouth in Nakhon Sawan, Kaokala expanded its online presence and held public meet-ups, earning nationwide attention through the media.\n\nA community crystallised. Manop Ampan, 65, is a former local government communications officer who now helps run the group\u2019s social media. Krittaya Ketkaewsuwan, a 30- year-old graphic designer from Bangkok, joined because she loved sci-fi and really wants to see a UFO. She said she believed in \u201cabout 50 percent\u201d of the group\u2019s claims.\n\nPloy Buranasiri, 29, another designer, said that spirituality was her gateway to Kaokala. According to Wassana the aliens chose Thailand as their contact point because the country had many Buddhists, who could use meditation to communicate with them. As well as talking to aliens through such meditation, Ploy believes she can \u201csee people\u2019s karma,\u201d and has been active with Kaokala for nine years. \u201cAt first my mom thought it was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I explained that we don\u2019t do anything bad. We\u2019re just trying to help people.\u201d\n\nAnn Thongcharoen, a core UFO Kaokala member, in Nakhon Sawan. Image: Jamie Fullerton\n\nOthers have rocketed deeper into the wormhole. Ann Thongcharoen, 28, who works at her family\u2019s restaurant in Bangkok, casually pointed out alien sighting locations as if they were historical buildings on a tour. \u201cHere\u2019s where we saw aliens from Pluto\u2014they use synthetic suits to walk on Earth,\u201d she said as we trudged up Khao Kala mountain: a precipice covered in lush forest located a half-hour drive from Wassana\u2019s house.\n\nUFO Kaokala\u2014Kaokala Coordination for Disasters Warning Group, to give the full title\u2014took its name from Khao Kala mountain after aliens apparently told Wassana that there was a portal to another dimension there. For the past six years members have been meeting by the Buddhist statues on the peak to camp, meditate and spot UFOs.\n\nTheir UFO evidence didn\u2019t extend far beyond blurry photos of what looked like saucepan lids flung into the sky above the mountain\u2019s golden Buddha statue. As we climbed higher, Ann remained insistent. \u201cHere\u2019s where someone saw an alien robot,\u201d she said, as the forest got denser and mosquitos began dive-bombing. She told me to take photos of the sky, so we could zoom in and check for spaceships later.\n\n*\n\nKhao Kala mountain, with its jagged rock formations and fluttering butterflies, was calming and pretty on my visit, but was recently the scene of high drama. In mid-August police and Forestry Department officials raided the peak. Officers said the Kaokala group was impinging on protected forest area by building bathroom and storage buildings by the statues, and illegally camping there. \u201cIf a UFO descends and parks here, that\u2019s even better,\u201d one officer told local media. \u201cWe\u2019ll capture them all.\u201d\n\nCharoen Raepetch, a Kaokala member identified by cops as the man behind the structures on the mountain, was told to expect charges soon, and the group is braced for a fine of up to 150,000 baht ($4,900). Wassana said that the core members will probably try and club together to pay the fine, if it comes to that. They haven\u2019t slept on the mountain since the raid, and much of their equipment has been shifted out by authorities.\n\nWalking up to the peak of Khao Kala mountain.

Some Thais have used the group\u2019s social media channels to accuse them of insulting Buddhism by linking it with wacky claims about aliens. Others have cast suspicion on Charoen taking donations to fund structures on the peak. Ann points out that it is free to be a Kaokala member. There was little evidence of decadence among the group leaders I met.\n\n\u201cSome people think Buddhism doesn\u2019t have anything to do with other civilizations,\u201d Ann said. \u201cBut Buddhism is about the universe, right? Some think it\u2019s only about praying and meditation, but it\u2019s more about outer space. I see comments, but I try to avoid them. I don\u2019t fight people.\u201d\n\nThe fallout from the raid didn\u2019t stop the group traipsing back up the mountain the weekend after the officers visited. At the peak, Manop waved his hands over images of spaceships etched into a stone slab they\u2019d placed next to the imposing golden Buddha. Small black pyramid models were scattered on the ground and balanced among tree branches. Wassana cleaned up detritus around the raid area; Ann and Ploy relaxed in the shadows of more Buddhist statues, embedded among tranquil forest.\n\nThe vibe was more \"weekend bus tour\" than \"doom cult,\" and local businesses unaffiliated to the group were taking advantage of the stream of alien obsessives. After visiting the mountain we hit a Nakhon Sawan market to load up on baggy t-shirts plastered with garish alien designs, seemingly teleported from a 1990s rave.\n\nSome Kaokala touches remained on Kha Kala mountain, despite authorities forcing the removal of much equipment. Image: Jamie Fullerton\n\nThe convoy continued to a dessert parlor, where graffiti-covered walls prompted more selfies. As wafers penetrated plump ice cream balls, the sisters said that with Kaokala group spirit still strong, they weren\u2019t worried by the raid. Communicating with ETs was not, they explained, reliant on one location\u2014portal or no portal. \u201cWe can stay in our homes and receive contact,\u201d Ann said. \u201cYou never know where you\u2019ll be at the time of World War III.\u201d\n\nTheir plan was to continue meditating until the aliens tell us how to tool up and survive Armageddon. \u201cThey\u2019ll visit us over different generations,\u201d Wassana said. \u201cBefore the nuclear disaster, during the disaster, after the disaster and for a restoration period. When it will begin, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nUntil then the Kaokala weekend fun trips will continue. The caf\u00e9 staff plonked six heavily laden ice cream bowls on our table, causing scrambles for spoons and smartphones.\n\nFollow Jamie Fullerton on Twitter and his website .", "description": "The \u2018space portal\u2019 where they supposedly chat to aliens was raided, but they aren't giving up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d924c33d68627000b9b2cfc/lede/1569870786636-6.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.749xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
