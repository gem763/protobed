Gains for the euro were capped, since the German economy is still likely to slip into recession as the U.S.-China trade conflict and Brexit bite, the Ifo economic institute said.\n\nThat followed Monday\u2019s euro zone composite flash Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) on Monday, which sank to 50.4 in September from 51.9 in August, lower than all forecasts in a Reuters poll, which had predicted a reading of 51.9.\n\n\u201cThe (European) data was quite negative but I think the euro has stabilized for now and we see it heading up to $1.12 versus the dollar in the coming months,\u201d said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole in London.\n\nThe euro was up 0.11% at $1.1003.\n\nThe dollar found little support from safe-haven flows as concern about trade talks between Washington and Beijing eased after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for talks in early October.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. one hundred dollar notes are seen in this picture illustration taken in Seoul February 7, 2011.
