(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nTrump officials will notify California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Thursday that the state is \u201cfailing to meet its obligations\u201d to protect the environment, just days after the president mocked its biggest cities for their \u201ctremendous pollution.\u201d\n\nThe unusual move by the Environmental Protection Agency ratchets up the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing battle against the nation\u2019s most populous state, a multi-pronged assault that Newsom has described as \u201cweaponizing\u201d the federal government. The fight extends from immigration to environmental policy and involves agencies ranging from the Justice Department to the Department of Homeland Security and EPA.\n\nIn an oversight letter, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler cites multiple instances of California failing to meet federal water-quality standards, attributing this in part to the state\u2019s homelessness problem.\n\n\u201cThe agency is aware of the growing homelessness crisis developing in major California cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the impact of this crisis on the environment,\u201d wrote Wheeler, who gave Newsom 30 days to respond. \u201cBased upon data and reports, the agency is concerned that California\u2019s implementation of federal environmental laws is failing to meet its obligations required under delegated federal programs.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Newsom and other top California officials have denounced Trump for targeting the state on several fronts. In the past month alone, the administration has moved to revoke the state\u2019s long-standing right to limit air pollution from cars, began investigating an agreement with four automakers for possible antitrust violations and threatened to withhold federal highway funds if California does not do more to clean up its air.\n\nCalifornia has emerged as one of the Democrats\u2019 most potent counterweights to the White House in the Trump era, advancing liberal priorities on everything from climate change to abortion rights. Its attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has sued the administration 62 times in federal court, blocking policies such as the White House plan to end protections for young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump talks with then-Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, left, on Nov. 17, 2018, as California Gov.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nSpeaking to reporters Tuesday in New York City, Newsom said California is promoting a shift to clean energy that threatens Trump\u2019s embrace of fossil fuels. In response, Trump and his deputies have started to retaliate, he said, by probing the state\u2019s deal with automakers to build cleaner cars and taking away its right to curb tailpipe emissions.\n\n\u201cThat paradigm is now challenged by an EPA that\u2019s been weaponized by the Trump administration,\u201d Newsom said, adding that his state and others are still pressing ahead. \u201cThey\u2019re losing; states are winning.\u201d\n\nEPA officials said the notice to California reflects the agency\u2019s broad policy priorities, rather than an attempt to single out the state. But while California has significant amounts of air and water pollution, so do other states.\n\nLast year, the EPA estimated that 3,508 community water systems were out of compliance with health-based standards. In its oversight letter, the agency cited 202 water systems in California that have recently reported drinking water problems. The state has 82 areas that don\u2019t meet air standards for six pollutants, and most of its plans to clean them up are still not approved by the EPA. But about three dozen other states also had counties that did not meet those national benchmarks.\n\nNewsom, who said Tuesday that the EPA was engaging in \u201cpure retaliation,\u201d has made no secret of his opposition to the White House. This spring, he said, \u201cI also see my role as not just the center of the resistance, but a positive alternative to Trump and Trumpism.\u201d\n\nTrump, for his part, has routinely criticized California officials for failing to protect their citizens from a range of threats, including wildfires and criminal acts by those in the country illegally.\n\nAt times, the president and Newsom have hurled insults at each other via Twitter. Just last week, Trump blasted California\u2019s environmental record as he flew back from the state to Washington on Air Force One.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous pollution being put into the ocean because they\u2019re going through what\u2019s called the storm sewer that\u2019s for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don\u2019t have to discuss pouring into the ocean,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cYou know, there are needles, there are other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation that\u2019s in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be giving San Francisco \u2014 they\u2019re in total violation \u2014 we\u2019re going to be giving them a notice very soon.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco officials reject the idea that they have failed to capture objects such as needles because they send sewage and street runoff to the same pipes. This combined discharge is treated at one of the city\u2019s sewage treatment plants, where pollutants are captured or treated before being released to the San Francisco Bay or the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\u201cWe have our challenges in San Francisco around homelessness,\u201d San Francisco Mayor London Breed\u2019s communications director, Jeff Cretan, said in response to Trump\u2019s comments aboard Air Force One. \u201cBut in terms of needles flowing into the bay, it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\n[From plastic straws to discarded syringes, San Francisco\u2019s complex problems]\n\nAfter Trump declared last week that the EPA would put California on notice, officials were unsure what statutes would be used to do so, and there was no specific plan in place, according to two White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nTrump regularly brings up California\u2019s homelessness problems in meetings, telling aides that the government needs to highlight what he sees as bad, liberal governance \u2014 and to step in.\n\nBut that fixation does not extend nearly as much to other cities, such as New York. Homelessness in California has been featured on Trump\u2019s preferred cable news network, Fox News, with 10 segments in August alone.\n\nEarlier this month, officials from several agencies, including the EPA, traveled to Los Angeles to examine homelessness and visited spots such as skid row. And some administration officials have said they believe homeless people in California are even spreading leprosy, according to current and former White House officials.\n\nBut last week, the administration rejected a request from California officials for more federal funds to expand programs aimed at addressing the problem.\n\n[Trump officials tour FAA facility in California to possibly house homeless]\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, the national co-chair for Women for Trump, said the president does not hold a particular animus toward the state, even though he could.\n\n\u201cIt is a state that has sued him 60 times,\u201d said Dhillon, who spent time with Trump during his California visit last week and said she welcomes his attention. \u201cI think the president shows remarkable good humor and grace when California has its hand out for support of fires or whatever the state needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president wants to take over these issues,\u201d she said of homelessness or environmental issues, but added, \u201cIt is appropriate for the federal government to have scrutiny on California.\u201d\n\n\n\nTents and tarps erected by homeless people are seen along sidewalks in the skid row area of downtown Los Angeles on June 28. (Patrick T. Fallon/Reuters)\n\nEarlier this week, EPA officials suggested California authorities are doing an inadequate job of curbing air and water pollution and ranked the state toward the bottom in the nation. On Monday, Wheeler notified the California Air Resources Board that it risks losing billions in highway funding if it did not offer updated plans on how it plans to meet federal health-based standards for soot, smog and other pollutants.\n\nSince Trump took office, EPA leaders have emphasized that they hope to improve water quality across the United States, identifying it as a priority in a long-term strategic plan last year. \u201cMany communities need to improve and maintain both drinking water and wastewater infrastructure and develop the capacity to comply with new and existing standards,\u201d the agency wrote.\n\nThe agency set a goal of reducing the number of community water systems out of compliance from over 3,500 to 2,700 by Sept. 30, 2022.\n\nWhile the EPA routinely forges consent decrees with state and local governments to address sewer and stormwater issues, it is rare for the agency to send an oversight letter suggesting that state officials are failing to enforce federal pollution standards on a broad scale.\n\nThis is the first letter of its kind that the Trump administration has sent out, EPA officials said. They pointed to a similar letter sent to Wisconsin in 2011 under the Obama administration, which identified numerous deficiencies in the way the state managed water pollution problems. That 26-page letter gave the state three months to reply and came after half a dozen meetings and calls with state officials.\n\nSan Francisco is one of the few major cities with sewers that combine stormwater and sewage flows that is not operating under a federal consent decree.\n\nDrawing on public databases and press reports \u2014 including a NPR report in August that \u201cpiles of human feces\u201d are now visible on sidewalks and streets in San Francisco \u2014 Wheeler noted that even California\u2019s own government has posted studies noting that human waste can increase bacteria levels in water off its beaches.\n\nHe detailed a litany of federal water quality violations across the state, saying California \u201chas not acted with a sense of urgency to abate this public health and environmental problems.\u201d\n\nThe examples include a \u201cyears-long practice\u201d of San Francisco routinely discharging more than a billion gallons of combined sewage and stormwater annually into San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean without treating it for biological contaminants.\n\nIn addition, the letter says during the most recent reporting quarter, more than 200 water systems across the state reported 665 instances of exceeding health-based levels of arsenic and other regulated contaminants.\n\n\u201cThese exceedances call into question the state\u2019s ability to protect the public and administer its [Safe Drinking Water Act] programs in a manner consistent with federal requirements,\u201d the letter states.\n\nSan Francisco is currently spending billions to upgrade its aging infrastructure, including $4.8 billion to improve regional and local water systems that 2.7 million use. It has also launched a 20-year, multibillion-dollar sewer system upgrade.", "description": "The warning from the federal government comes after President Trump criticized the \u201ctremendous pollution\u201d in the state.", "authors": ["Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs", "Brady Dennis", "Reporter Focusing On Environmental Policy", "Public Health Issues", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "September At Am", "Juliet Eilperin Is The Washington Post'S Senior National Affairs Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xrmUtfrUA2soohDDIwp3stA6A24=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A2TXUCXABQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
