It is unclear how the gang was able to order the cab and whether a stolen card was used.\n\nHe said during the trip he saw them flashing numerous credit cards, delivering dodgy packages to various addresses and boasted of spending \u00a340,000 at an 18th birthday party.\n\nHe said: 'I was scared the whole time. At one stop they said: 'That's another gang, this is dangerous, we have to move.\n\n'I thought there was going to be fight. Another gang member shone his motorbike lights into the car to see who was inside and they said: 'Let's go, let's go.'\n\nAn Uber spokeswoman said that it takes 'a zero tolerance approach to any illegal activity on our app'\n\n'They are dangerous people. If they started fighting I would get hurt. I don't want to witness this kind of behaviour.'\n\nThe gang ordered the Uber at 3pm, for a short one mile trip. But after arriving at their destination, they demanded he head to another address.\n\nThis continued for the next eight hours until they all got out at a petrol station and he managed to drive away.\n\nThe driver said when he complained to Uber, he did not get any response more than a week later.\n\n'It was dangerous, I was driving for eight-and-a-half hours without a break,' the driver said. There needs to be better safety for drivers.'\n\nAn Uber spokeswoman said: 'We take a zero tolerance approach to any illegal activity on our app.\n\n'If we are made aware of any allegations of this nature we reserve the right to immediately terminate access to the app and we work closely with police authorities across the UK.'\n\nAccording to the National Crime Agency, County Lines drug dealers often use app-based minicab companies.\n\nA spokesman said: 'An emerging trend around the use of app-based taxi companies to transport both offenders and potential victims of exploitation to supply areas has been identified.'\n\nCounty Lines gangs traffic drugs from big cities, such as London, Birmingham and Manchester to rural areas to sell.\n\nEssex and other Home Counties have been identified as target areas.\n\nThe gangs groom youngsters to deal drugs in the rural areas through phone lines.\n\nPolice estimate there are 1,000 branded County Lines phone numbers across the country.", "description": "The terrified cabbie spent over eight hours ferrying three boys around east London, starting from Romford, and travelling as far as Clacton in Essex and back again.", "authors": ["Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20028992-0-image-a-14_1571737588579.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
