The Constitution grants the House \u201csole power of impeachment,\u201d and the chambers set their own rules. The White House claims the House must hold a full vote to render the inquiry operative, but this is simply baseless.\n\nSo let\u2019s focus on something else in the letter: It unequivocally declares that in his phone call to the Ukrainian president, Trump did nothing whatsoever wrong.\n\nIn the letter, White House counsel Pat Cipollone claims that Trump heroically released the rough transcript of that call, even though this came only under extreme political duress. \u201cThe record clearly established that the call was completely appropriate,\u201d Cipollone insists, adding that \u201cthere was nothing wrong with the call.\u201d\n\nThe rough transcript of the July 25 call released by the White House reveals that Trump directly pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate likely general-election opponent Joe Biden, and to try to invalidate our intelligence services\u2019 conclusion about the Russian attack on our political system on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nThe first of these is based on a fabricated narrative about the Bidens. The second is based on an absurd conspiracy theory designed to delegitimize the genesis of the Russia investigation.\n\nBut, putting aside the fact that Trump\u2019s demands were based on nonsense, what\u2019s notable here is that the White House\u2019s official position is that the conduct itself, that is, Trump\u2019s act of pressing Zelensky to do these things, is perfectly okay.\n\nBut the White House itself knows this is nonsense. Here are five facts that demonstrate this:\n\nWhite House officials tried to bury the call. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint says White House officials were so alarmed by the call that they stashed it on a super-top-secret computer system ordinarily used only for the most sensitive information in the government\u2019s possession.\n\nAs Glenn Kessler demonstrates, not only has much of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint been confirmed via outside sources; the White House itself has confirmed that this particular stashing of the call did occur. This wouldn\u2019t have been necessary if the call was completely kosher.\n\nTrump keeps saying the events in the transcript didn\u2019t happen. Trump just tweeted that the whistleblower\u2019s claim of \u201cpressure\u201d on Zelensky is false. He has made this claim on other occasions.\n\nBut the transcript simply does show pressure: After Zelensky made it clear that Ukraine badly needs U.S. support for its military defenses, Trump says he wants \u201ca favor, though,\u201d making this a condition, and then states his demands, stressing that it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d that Zelensky implement them. If the events depicted were perfectly appropriate, Trump wouldn\u2019t have to keep lying to obscure what happened.\n\nThe texts show Trump is lying about pressuring Zelensky. The texts released by Democrats show that the call was part of a systematic, long-running plot carried out in part by two U.S. ambassadors (Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland) to pressure Zelensky to carry out Trump\u2019s demands.\n\nJust before the call, Volker texted a Zelensky aide to say that the White House had indicated to him that carrying out those investigations was conditional for getting a White House meeting. Some time after the call, Sondland described those investigations as the \u201cdeliverable\u201d needed in exchange for that meeting.\n\nCrucially, the White House isn\u2019t defending this quid pro quo. Instead, Trumpworld has claimed there isn\u2019t one. You don\u2019t need a quid pro quo for this to be impeachable, but the texts simply do establish one \u2014 and raise further questions about whether military aid was also dangled. If the call were kosher, the White House would be able to defend what actually happened, including the surrounding events that illuminate it.\n\nThe White House won\u2019t release the full call transcript. Experts have said the White House transcript likely reflects material omissions, and Democrats have subpoenaed the full transcript. The White House\u2019s current position of zero cooperation means it won\u2019t be released unless the courts force it.\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be necessary if there were \u201cnothing wrong with the call.\u201d Surely the White House could at least release most of the transcript in a way that avoided revealing sensitive information.\n\nThe White House blocked Sondland from testifying. This came just hours before Sondland was set to appear. The texts show that Ambassador William Taylor repeatedly confronted Sondland, asking him why the military aid was conditioned on helping Trump\u2019s political campaign. Sondland denied that particular quid pro quo.\n\nNotably, Trump himself keeps citing that denial from Sondland as exonerating. Yet the White House is blocking him from scrutiny. We now know one obvious reason: Sondland talked directly to Trump before telling Taylor there was no quid pro quo. If the call were fine, there\u2019d be no reason to block Sondland from shedding more light on events illuminating how Trump himself intended his ongoing demands.\n\nTo sum up: The White House\u2019s position is now that everything on the call was perfectly appropriate, but also, the most conspicuous confirmed misconduct on the call didn\u2019t happen, the White House won\u2019t release the full transcript of it, and the one witness to surrounding events whom Trump himself cites as exonerating him must not be allowed to face questioning.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump is betraying his oath of office.
