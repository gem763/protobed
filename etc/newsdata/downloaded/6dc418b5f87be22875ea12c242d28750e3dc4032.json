When ICE seeks custody of an illegal alien it is almost always because the alien has a criminal past or is a known gang member. Roeland Park is now going to be releasing those illegal aliens onto the street. The Roeland Park policy severely restricts its officers from sending this information. The city is breaking federal law by adopting this policy, but unfortunately federal law doesn\u2019t include penalties for cities that disobey it. As Senator, I will push to restrict federal funds to sanctuary cities that put American lives in danger. Many lives have been taken by illegal aliens in Kansas. This sanctuary policy increases the chances that more lives will be lost.\n\nKobach detailed recent cases where Americans have been killed by illegal aliens in the Kansas City metro area, including a March 2016 quadruple homicide allegedly committed by illegal alien Pablo Antonio-Vitorino, the September 2016 killing of Johnson County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Brandon Collins by illegal alien Adrian Espinosa-Flores, and the death of Amanda Bixby in February 2007 at the hands of illegal alien Ricardo De-Leon.\n\nAngel Dad Dennis Bixby said he is forever separated from his daughter Amanda because of illegal immigration in Kansas:\n\nThere will be no more birthdays, no holidays, no wedding for me to give her away, and no grandchildren. City council members should ask themselves how they would respond to a grieving parent or family when they are asked why they so callously approved this policy.\n\nFor years, Kobach has sought to ban sanctuary cities in Kansas. One of Kobach\u2019s opponents in the GOP primary Senate, Susan Wagle \u2014 who has been Kansas Senate President since 2013 \u2014 previously blocked his 2017 effort to outlaw sanctuary cities in the state in 2017. The legislation passed out of committee with majority support, but Wagle failed to ever bring the bill to a vote.\n\nFull Disclosure: Kris Kobach writes a weekly column for Breitbart News.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
