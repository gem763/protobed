REUTERS/Robert Galbraith\n\nHBO Max, scheduled to be launched next year, will combine the network\u2019s acclaimed programming such as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with Warner Bros movies, classic TV shows including \u201cFriends,\u201d and original programming. The goal is to compete with companies such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for a broad audience.\n\nWarnerMedia will be able to market the service to the tens of millions of customers of AT&T\u2019s wireless, DirecTV and television services and introduce them to the programming, Robert Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment and Direct-to-Consumer, said late on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIn this new world we live in, I think unless you can get the scale, and unless you can reach millions and millions of people, I don\u2019t think you really have a chance,\u201d Greenblatt said.\n\n\u201cWe need a company of this size and scale and this enormous customer base,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cThe whole thing is just a big advantage to us.\u201d\n\nNetflix reported nearly 152 million paid memberships as of the end of June. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to offer its TV service, Apple TV+, for free for one year to anyone who buys a new Apple device, putting the programming in front of potentially 130 million or more iPhone users alone, according to Wall Street estimates.\n\nHBO boasts 140 million subscribers globally, mostly through pay television services such as DirecTV and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), the company has said. At least 5 million of its subscribers are digital customers in the United States.\n\nGreenblatt said AT&T would offer \u201cincentives for customers that will bring them into HBO Max, hopefully right away.\u201d He said details would be announced later.\n\nAT&T has said it has more than 170 million direct customer relationships through TV, phone and broadband services. It also operates 5,500 retail stores.\n\nWarnerMedia is the company previously known as Time Warner, the owner of HBO, CNN, the Warner Bros TV and movie studios, and other entertainment properties. AT&T purchased Time Warner last year.\n\nElliott Management Corp, which disclosed a large stake in AT&T earlier this month, has argued that AT&T has \u201cfailed to articulate a clear strategic rationale\u201d for the purchase.\n\nAT&T executives remain committed to a big push into entertainment under Chief Operating Officer John Stankey, Greenblatt said.\n\n\u201cI have nothing but 100% confidence from my management and AT&T that this is the direction to go,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe company used to be very siloed,\u201d he added. \u201cNow with John Stankey running the whole show, now that we are all one company, there is an enormous amount of collaboration.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: The company logo for AT&T is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nHBO Max will debut in the United States. The company has plans to expand to international markets over the next few years, Greenblatt said.\n\nWarnerMedia plans to unveil more details about its strategy at an Oct. 29 event for investors.\n\n\u201cYou will see at that point the real depths to which this company has gone and committed to this,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cThey\u2019re really in it to win it.\u201d", "description": "The forthcoming HBO Max streaming service needs the reach of its parent company AT&T Inc to compete in the streaming video wars, a senior WarnerMedia executive said in an interview, as the company faces pressure from an activist investor to explain its media strategy.", "authors": ["Lisa Richwine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433856766&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1R4", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
