Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders to release health records by end of year Warren faces tough choices on funding 'Medicare for all' Saagar Enjeti dismisses Buttigieg over policies: He 'really is a neoliberal shapeshifter' MORE (I-Vt.) the most honest of the Democratic presidential candidates when it comes to how their health care plans would affect individuals\u2019 costs.\n\nThe Morning Consult poll finds that 49 percent of all voters rate Sanders as honest on the question, compared to 20 percent who don\u2019t know and 31 percent who say he\u2019s dishonest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs the debate over \"Medicare for All\" rages in the primary, Sanders has been upfront about the fact that taxes will have to go up for the middle class to pay for his plan, but he argues middle-class people will save money overall once the elimination of premiums and deductibles is factored in.\n\nWarren, meanwhile, has taken heat for declining to directly answer the middle-class tax question. She has now said she will soon release a plan for how she will pay for Medicare for All.\n\nAll of the candidates rate higher among only Democratic voters, but Sanders still comes out on top on honesty, at 75 percent for Sanders, 67 percent for Biden, 62 percent for Warren and 51 percent for Buttigieg.\n\nThe poll also had a warning sign for Medicare for All. It found that just 31 percent of voters would support a plan \u201cthat would require the middle class to pay higher taxes, where the increased taxes were offset by overall savings on individual health care costs.\u201d\n\nFifty-one percent of voters were opposed to such a plan.", "description": "Voters rated Sen.
