When the company was founded, it took pride in not being a \u201ctheater.\u201d (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nBack when I was a young thespian at Rockville High School, the highest praise we drama nerds could offer after seeing an amazing play or a stellar performance was, \u201cAnd that is the difference between \u2018theatre\u2019 with an -RE and \u2018theater\u2019 with an -ER.\u201d\n\nIt was obvious to us which was preferable. We might have been doing high school theater, but we aspired to high school theatre.\n\nBut why?\n\nI\u2019ve been pondering that lately. When the Americans kicked out the British nearly 250 years ago, we spared ourselves from a lot of things: warm beer, driving on the left and using such words as \u201ccolour,\u201d \u201chonour\u201d and \u201cdiarrhoea.\u201d\n\nAnd \u201ctheatre.\u201d\n\nExcept, apparently, we didn\u2019t. \u201cTheatre\u201d is everywhere, even here in the capital of the country that threw off the yoke of Anglo oppression. Studio Theatre. Signature Theatre. Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company. Ford\u2019s Theatre. Even National Theatre.\n\n\n\nWe should probably cut the Shakespeare Theatre Company some slack. But if it\u2019s in the Lansburgh Theatre, why isn\u2019t it the Harman \u201cCentre\u201d for the Arts? (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nWhatever is the mattre, er, matter?\n\nDavid Muse, artistic director of Studio Theatre on 14th Street NW, said when Joy Zinoman founded Studio in 1978, \u201cthe place actually took pride in \u2018theatre\u2019 -RE as opposed to \u2018theater\u2019 -ER.\u201d\n\nThe organization even produced a T-shirt that had \u201cStudio Theater\u201d on it, the -ER crossed out and replaced with -RE, he said.\n\nTwo years after Studio\u2019s birth, Howard Shalwitz and the co-founders of what became Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company were kicking around names.\n\n\u201cWe got very drunk one night and just did all the names we could think of,\u201d he said. \u201cI still have the actual handwritten pages in the archives. There are about 100 names on there: all the planets, all the Greek gods, about 20 different characters in Shakespeare.\u201d\n\n\n\nA bike rack in front of Woolly Mammoth on D Street NW leaves no doubt how the theater spells its name. \u201cOur idea of a company was much more of a European idea,\u201d said co-founder Howard Shalwitz. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nThe first part of the name might have been in question, but the last part never was: Theatre.\n\n\u201cOur idea of a company was much more of a European idea,\u201d Shalwitz said. \u201cI think that our mental orientation was toward the more English form.\u201d\n\nEric Schaeffer, co-founder of Signature Theatre in Arlington, sent an email from South Korea, where he is directing a production of \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d Wrote Schaeffer: \u201cI remember we thought we should use the British spelling of \u2018theatre\u2019 so that people would take us more seriously.\u201d\n\nMike Litterst of the National Park Service said they go with Ford\u2019s Theatre because that was the name in 1865, \u201cso we keep the historic spelling today,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nSome people make a distinction between theater the building and theatre the art form.\n\nStudio\u2019s Muse said \u201c-RE\u201d feels more refined to some people. \u201cIt signals maybe theater as art. It\u2019s indebted to the British and grand tradition of theater that stretches back centuries,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, it feels maybe a little pretentious,\u201d Muse said. And is it now a little uncomfortably Anglophilic? Because, you know, one can bristle at the notion that the Brits do it better or have the lock on sophistication.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of the Brits, Simon Godwin is one. He just took the helm at the Shakespeare Theatre Company. He\u2019s never worked at a theater, only theatres. Even his U.S. productions were at New York\u2019s Roundabout Theatre and the Theatre for a New Audience.\n\nWhen Michael Kahn founded the company, Godwin said, \u201cThe spelling deliberately mirrored the British as a kind of, I guess, way of celebrating the British tradition that Shakespeare was in.\u201d\n\nSince the Bard\u2019s texts celebrate language, Godwin thinks audiences understand the difference between a Shakespeare Theatre and a Shakespeare Theater.\n\nI get it. Theater is about illusion and if arranging letters a certain way plants a suggestion in an audience\u2019s mind, so be it. But even as a hardcore Anglophile, I wish we were confident enough in our native talents to proudly embrace theater.\n\nOur city\u2019s oldest resident theater company isn\u2019t a \u201cTheater.\u201d It\u2019s a \u201cStage\u201d: Arena Stage, founded in 1950. Today, the official title is Arena Stage at the Mead Center for American Theater.\n\n\u201cWe use the American spelling because our mission is producing American plays with American artists,\u201d artistic director Molly Smith said in an email. \u201cWe are the largest theater in America focused in this way because we believe in the range and talent of American artists. Being situated in our nation\u2019s capital, we are at the crossroads of American ideas.\u201d\n\nTheater! Theater! USA! USA!\n\nI couldn\u2019t find many other \u201ctheaters\u201d in town. There is the Eisenhower Theater at the Kennedy Center. Dwight D. Eisenhower was a great American, and even though he was instrumental to the history of Europe \u2014 helping to save it during World War II \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine going to see a show at the Eisenhower Theatre.\n\nPlus, if you had Eisenhower Theatre, you\u2019d have to have Kennedy Centre. And that just looks weird.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Is it a wee bit pretentious for American theaters to adopt Shakespeare\u2019s spelling?", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/82engM9mqTIqSvIs4w52SSv4qtg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CMGCLQHBHUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
