Such a move would allow the EU27 to agree without holding a summit.\n\n\u201cFollowing PM\u2019s decision to pause the process of ratification of the withdrawal agreement, and in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit, I will recommend the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension. For this I will propose a written procedure,\u201d he tweeted.", "description": "Irish PM Leo Varadkar and head of European parliament support three-month extension", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "The Civil Servant"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad426423ff90297135a7e8c36a8003f480e310a/0_38_3363_2018/master/3363.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b52c46529c3f86464725ab536c0e7913", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
