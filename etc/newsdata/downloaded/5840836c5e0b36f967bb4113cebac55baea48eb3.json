Mitie reviewed its strategy and accounts after a string of profit warnings in 2016.\n\nThe collapse of rival Carillion and Interserve\u2019s slide into administration have hurt sentiment towards UK contractors and outsourcing groups, but Bentley has been optimistic that Mitie would emerge well placed from the shakeout.\n\nMitie, which provides cleaning, security and healthcare services, said Woolf would leave on Jan. 28. He joined the company in 2017.\n\n\u201cPaul has been hugely supportive in the turnaround of Mitie, bringing in new financial disciplines and helping restore investor confidence,\u201d Mitie Chairman Derek Mapp said in a statement.\n\nMitie, which manages and maintains London\u2019s landmarks, high- street buildings and homes, reported a rise in first-quarter revenue in July, boosted by new contracts and a recent acquisition in its security business, but said higher-than-planned costs weighed on profits.", "description": "British outsourcing firm Mitie Group Plc said on Wednesday Chief Financial Officer Paul Woolf had resigned to join intellectual property management company CPA Global as its finance boss.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
