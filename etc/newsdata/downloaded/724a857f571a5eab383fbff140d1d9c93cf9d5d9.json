Brian Babin (R-Texas) and signed by 25 GOP lawmakers \u2014 sent to Pelosi on Wednesday, the members argued while they disagree with Democrats position on impeachment, it will be \u201cone of the most serious and profound votes any of us will ever cast.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs you know, there is no requirement for a roll call vote in the House to be conducted by electronic device and tabulation.

Out of 330 million Americans, we are the 435 elected and trusted to make this decision on their behalf. They deserve to hear from our own voices rather than from a spreadsheet on the Clerk\u2019s website.\"\n\nHouse Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) unveiled the resolution on Tuesday, which directs the House Oversight and Reform Committee, House Intelligence Committee and House Committee on Foreign Affairs to move forward with their probes and lays the groundwork for the House Intelligence Committee to hold open hearings.\n\nDemocrats argue bringing the measure to the floor will increase transparency in the impeachment process. But Republicans have slammed the resolution as too little too late, alleging it codifies the process that was already taking place.\n\n\u201cEven my colleagues who disagree with me on that should agree with what we are trying to accomplish with this letter: accountability and transparency for the American people on this incredibly serious matter and important vote,\u201d Babin said in a statement.\n\n\u201cInstead of quietly casting our votes on the electronic system before leaving town for another recess week, we should all stand before our colleagues and the country to answer the question when our name is called one at a time - all 432 of us currently in office from Abraham (A) to Zeldin (Z).\u201d\n\nWhile the Senate regularly takes roll call votes, the House \u2014 which has 435 members \u2014 traditionally reserves roll call votes for electing a new speaker.", "description": "A group of House Republicans is calling on Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to have members cast their votes vocally instead of electronically on a resolution on impeachment procedures slated to come to the floor on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pelosinancy_101719gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
