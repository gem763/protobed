It will be presented to European leaders at a two-day summit in Brussels that begins on Thursday.\n\nREAD MORE: pound set for biggest rising streak in more than three decades\n\nHowever, even if it is approved by European leaders, the deal faces a difficult path to ratification. The deal must be approved by the UK\u2019s parliament, which rejected former Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal three times.\n\nThe pound was under pressure earlier Thursday after Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) rejected a draft text of the deal.\n\nSupport from the DUP is crucial for getting any deal through parliament given the ruling Conservative Party\u2019s lack of majority in the House of Commons. The DUP said they stood behind their earlier statement following the publication of the draft deal.\n\n\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Where there is a will, there is a #deal - we have one! It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions. I recommend that #EUCO endorses this deal. pic.twitter.com/7AfKyCZ6k9 \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU) October 17, 2019\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn also criticised the deal, saying in a statement: \u201cIt seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s, which was overwhelmingly rejected.\u201d\n\nJo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the fourth biggest party in the House of Commons, said the deal \"would be bad for our economy, bad for our public services, and bad for our environment.\"\n\n\"When this deal comes to Parliament we will use every possible opportunity to give the public a People's Vote on the Brexit deal that includes the option to remain in the European Union,\" Swinson said in a statement.\n\nMarkets reaction\n\nThe DUP\u2019s rejection and the parliamentary arithmetic kept a lid on sterling. Analysts had said that a deal between the EU and UK could see the pound rise as high as $1.35.\n\n\u201cIf [Boris Johnson] manages to get it through parliament, we should see a wave of \u2018risk-on\u2019 trades coming into UK market,\u201d Artur Baluszynski, head of research at investment manager Henderson Rowe, said.\n\n\u201cHowever, let us wait and see all the details and then let the markets decide how likely it is for the UK parliament to accept it. For now, expect some positive momentum in sterling and domestically focused asset classes.\u201d\n\nThe FTSE 250 index (^FTMC), which is weighted towards UK-facing businesses, was up 1% shortly after the deal was announced. The index had been down 0.5% in earlier trade.\n\nThe European Commission has published the full details of Boris Johnson's deal. You can find the revised Withdrawal Agreement here.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nMPs will hold an extraordinary sitting of Parliament on Saturday to vote on the deal if it is approved by EU leaders.\n\n\n\n", "description": "\"We\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control,\" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7KTTOph3zR_8l.GsVBSF0g--~B/aD0yMzYyO3c9MzUzMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/3a596a50-ef63-11e9-ba71-46454df9183a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
