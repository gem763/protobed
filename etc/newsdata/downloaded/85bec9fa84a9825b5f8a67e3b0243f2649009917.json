On that scoreboard is a list of statistics about your body\u2019s health and vitality. And a simple blood test can be an effective way to stay on top of your heart health game.\n\nThough blood tests are easy to get, the results aren\u2019t always easy to understand. And that\u2019s a problem when those scores and statistics are essential to your present and future health. I don\u2019t want this frustration to prevent you from taking action on your blood test results. Or worse, I don\u2019t want it to prevent you from getting a blood test.\n\nYour blood test results have several indicators specific to your heart health. I want to single out a few important ones and explain what they mean and what you can do to stay within healthy ranges. Please read on.\n\nC-reactive Protein (CRP)\n\nInflammation is your body\u2019s response to injury or infection. Your liver dispatches C-reactive protein (CRP) to that infection or injury via the bloodstream. It\u2019s a neat and efficient immune response, but chronic inflammation can lead to atherosclerosis, which is when blood passage through your arteries is narrowed by the accumulation of plague.\n\nBlood tests can show you exactly how much CRP is in your blood. But, it won\u2019t show you where your body is inflamed. And it can\u2019t tell you why you have inflammation. Elevated CRP will simply give you an idea of how much internal inflammation you have. And when combined with other blood test results and risk factors for heart disease, it colors in some of the gray areas of your overall heart health picture.\n\nYour CRP level can vary so, if you test high, I recommend you have it measured again a couple weeks later. You may see it labelled \u201chs-CRP\u201d on your test results which simply means \u201chigh sensitivity CRP\u201d. Levels consistently above 2.0 milligrams per liter of blood indicate a higher risk of heart disease.\n\nIf you have consistently elevated CRP, you should talk with your doctor about ways to lower it. And I suggest supplementing those interventions with daily curcumin. Many studies show that curcumin has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer superpowers[i]. Research shows 500 mg, three times daily, as a way to cool down chronic inflammation. Look for a supplement with enhanced bioavailability (either added piperine or gamma cyclodextrin \u2013 both which are safe and natural) so that your body absorbs the curcumin better.\n\nP.S. And that\u2019s just a preview of the many ways that curcumin is good for your heart health.\n\nHomocysteine\n\nHomocysteine is an amino acid in your blood that\u2019s produced by your body\u2019s metabolization of protein. High levels of it is called hyperhomocysteinemia, and it\u2019s often the result of:\n\nEating too much animal protein\n\nNot eating enough fruits and vegetables\n\nLow levels of folate and vitamins B6 and B12\n\nKidney disease\n\nHyperhomocysteinemia is closely associated with heart disease and neurological disorders in several studies. It\u2019s believed that those amino acids attach to blood platelets, increasing the risk of clot formation.[ii]\n\nBut the medical community isn\u2019t certain if elevated homocysteine levels are a possible cause of heart disease or the result of heart disease. While the science isn\u2019t settled on whether it was the chicken or the egg, one thing is certain: Heart disease and homocysteine often go hand in hand.\n\nTherefore, I think it\u2019s wise to play it safe and keep homocysteine levels within a healthy range \u2013 which is between 4.4 and 10.8 micromoles per liter of blood.\n\nResearch on homocysteine is still in its infancy compared to other heart health indicators. For now, the best intervention for high homocysteine levels is to counter it by consuming more folic acid, B vitamins (found in green, leafy vegetables) and consuming less animal proteins. Reducing your overall stress levels could help, too.\n\nCalcium\n\nCalcium is vital to your bone health. And about 99% of your body\u2019s calcium is stored in your teeth and bones \u2013 where it should be.\n\nBut when too much calcium is in your bloodstream\u2013 called hypercalcemia \u2013 it can lead to abnormal heart rhythm and even cardiac arrest. And that\u2019s on top of other symptoms such as abdominal pain, bone pain, depression, and kidney stones.\n\nCalcium can infiltrate your bloodstream a few ways:\n\nOveractive parathyroid glands\n\nBody acidity and mineral imbalance releasing calcium from your bones\n\nExcessive absorption of calcium by your intestines\n\nInadequate calcium excretion by your kidneys\n\nChronic immobility causes bones to release calcium into the blood\n\nExcess amounts of calcium and vitamin D supplements (Vitamin D stimulates your digestive tract to absorb calcium)[iii]\n\nNormal blood calcium levels, for adults, range from 8.5 to 10.3 mg/dL. There may be a subset reading of ionized calcium. If so, anything above 4.6 mg/dL is considered normal.\n\nIf you have hypercalcemia, or if your levels are too low, it\u2019s important to work with your doctor and specialists to find the cause(s) and determine the best way to treat it.\n\nCholesterol/Triglycerides\n\nCholesterol levels are divided between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein LDL. The simpler version is HDL is the good cholesterol and LDL is the bad cholesterol. While HDL is converted into vitamin D3 and other hormones, LDL is more likely to clog your arteries and plays a more significant role in heart disease.\n\nHDL levels between 50 and 60 mg/dL are considered good. Generally speaking, anything above 60mg is great\u2014anything below 50 is insufficient.\n\nMeanwhile, the range for healthy and unhealthy LDL levels is a little more nuanced so here\u2019s a handy chart.\n\nLDL cholesterol\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nOptimal Less than 100 mg/dL Good 100 to 129 mg/dL Borderline high 130 to 159 mg/dL High 160 to 189 mg/dL Very high Above 189 mg/dL\n\nFinally, a note about triglycerides. After foods are broken down and converted into sugar, any sugar that isn\u2019t used as fuel is converted into triglycerides. They\u2019re the main form of fat stored in our bodies. And, thanks to our ancient genetics where we used to live through periods of feast and famine, triglycerides are stored as an energy reserve for when there is no food available.\n\nObviously, we no longer live like our hunter/gatherer ancestors, so we rarely need those energy reserves. Instead those fats can build up to dangerous, heart-threatening levels. Here are some ranges to look for on your blood test results.\n\nTriglycerides\n\nHealthy Below 150 mg/dL Borderline 150-199 mg/dL High 200-499 mg/dL Very high Above 500 mg/dL\n\nI recently wrote extensively about HDL, LDL and triglycerides, including ways you can achieve healthy levels of each.\n\nOther Tests Important to your Heart Health\n\nThere are two other tests not associated with your blood that are critical markers of your heart health: blood pressure and EKG.\n\nYou\u2019ve likely had hundreds of blood pressure (BP) tests in your lifetime. It\u2019s standard procedure at nearly every doctor visit. Your local pharmacy may even have a self-service blood pressure machine in its waiting area. That goes to show how important it is to keep tabs on your BP.\n\nBlood pressure is simply a measure of the force of blood pushing against your artery walls. Systolic pressure measures the pressure during a heartbeat. Diastolic pressure is the measure of pressure, between beats, when your heart is at rest. These two numbers make up your BP reading, expressed as systolic over diastolic (for example, 120/80 mmHg).\n\nAnywhere between 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg is considered a healthy BP. If your systolic pressure falls between 120-130, your BP is considered elevated. If your overall BP ranges from 130/80 to 139/89, it\u2019s considered Stage 1 Hypertension. A BP at or above 140/90 is considered Stage 2 Hypertension.\n\nOver time, high BP puts undo stress on your artery walls, creating microscopic tears, nooks and scar tissue \u2013 ideal locations for plaque to build and cause blockages.\n\nYour age and family medical history can significantly influence your BP. But so does your lifestyle. BP can be significantly reduced by improving your diet, drinking plenty of water every day, exercising regularly, getting good sleep every night, getting a handle on stress, and putting an end to bad habits like smoking and excessive drinking.\n\nNattokinase is a fantastic natural way to help get BP under control, especially if lifestyle changes aren\u2019t giving you the results you hoped for. Nattokinase has been shown, in research, to be safe and effective for lowering BP in as little as eight weeks[iv]. Plus, it\u2019s natural and side-effect free! I recommend that you take 2,000 FU/day (fibrinogen units) of nattokinase.\n\nFinally, I want to mention EKG tests and how they relate to your heart health \u2013 especially if heart disease runs in your family.\n\nAn EKG (Electrocardiogram) records the electrical activity of your heart. It can detect arrhythmia in real time. It can also show if current chest pain is caused by an inadequate blood and oxygen supply to the heart, or if you have structural abnormalities.\n\nEKGs are routinely recommended if you have hypertension or if your PCP detects signs of arrhythmia. It can also be ordered if you suddenly experience heart palpitations, chest pain, rapid pulse, or shortness of breath.\n\nYour blood is vital to your heart health, but so is your body\u2019s wiring. If your circuits aren\u2019t firing they way they should, EKGs can help pinpoint the reason. They can also detect early signs of \u201cthe big one\u201d so you can prevent a heart attack or stroke instead of spend months or years recuperating from one.\n\nKeep Your Ticker Ticking\n\nBlood test results will show vital markers of nutrients, waste, indications of disease, and more. For doctors, it\u2019s all very basic. For you, the acronyms and medical lingo can look like somebody spilled alphabet soup all over the paper.\n\nBetter-informed patients are more likely to be healthier patients. I hope this information helps cut through the confusion of blood tests and helps you keep your ticker ticking.\n\nReferences\n\n[i] Deguchi A., \u201cCurcumin Targets in Inflammation and Cancer.\u201d Endocrine, Metabolic, and Immune Disorder Targets. 2015;15(2):88-96.
