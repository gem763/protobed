PG&E said customers could be affected by a shut-off even if they aren\u2019t experiencing extreme weather conditions in their specific location. The utility filed for bankruptcy in January as it struggled with billions of dollars in potential liabilities from its role in sparking wildfires in California, triggering one of the largest corporate-reorganization cases in years. And earlier this month, PG&E agreed to pay a penalty and fund a $60 million program to resolve accusations that its employees violated state law at least 170,000 times from 2012 to 2017 by falsifying records showing how workers handled requests to mark underground equipment before excavations. The utility has been under nearly constant investigation over the past decade for safety violations that authorities allege have led to scores of deaths and injuries.\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
