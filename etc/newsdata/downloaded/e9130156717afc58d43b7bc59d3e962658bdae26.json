It tells the story of the Bone cousins (Fone Bone, Phoney Bone, and Smiley Bone) as they\u2019re run out of their hometown of Boneville and into a mysterious (and dangerous!)

Hell\u2026 after decades of existing purely on the page, just finding the \u201cright\u201d voices for the Bone cousins seems like quite the task. Studios have been trying since the late 90s to adapt Bone for the screen, only for efforts to fall apart over the years.
