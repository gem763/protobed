But it's never too early to start looking ahead. And it's already fair to wonder whether any Liberal or Conservative minority government would be able to satisfy the New Democrats or Greens.\n\nThen again, that question assumes the New Democrats or Greens would end up holding the balance of power in a minority Parliament.\n\nThe latest jockeying involves the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.\n\nSpeaking to CBC News on Wednesday, May said she would not support a government that was committed to building the expansion. Though he wasn't quite as categorical as May, Singh later said he would remain opposed to the project.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says he will continue to fight the Trans Mountain pipeline, even if there is a minority government. 2:13\n\nThe question of who would support what has become a significant subplot in the NDP-Green fight for third place.\n\nIt began in July, when May said she would support any government that was willing to take sufficient action against climate change. A month later, after the Liberals unearthed video of Andrew Scheer condemning same-sex marriage in 2005, Singh declared that he would never prop a Conservative government.\n\nSingh then tried to use his position to draw a distinction between his party and the Greens.\n\n\"We strongly believe that we should not be putting Mr. Scheer in the prime minister's seat, unlike Ms. May and the Green Party, who believe that's the right choice,\" Singh said at the first leaders' debate in September.\n\nMay called that claim \"absurd\" and clarified that she would not support any government that failed to present a climate plan in line with the goal of limiting further global warming to 1.5 C.\n\nA Conservative minority in a tight corner\n\nThat line in the sand has now been extended to include the Trans Mountain expansion.\n\nAndrew Scheer's available options for winning the confidence of the House in a minority scenario would thus seem to be limited \u2014 not only because the NDP has categorically ruled itself out, but also because May's conditions seem particularly unlikely to be met by a minority Conservative government.\n\nAs Chantal H\u00e9bert wrote this week in the Toronto Star, it appears the Conservatives will need their own majority to follow through on their promises to repeal existing climate policies.\n\nBut it's also fair to wonder whether Justin Trudeau would be at all willing to satisfy the conditions being thrown up by the NDP and the Greens.\n\nSpeaking in Montreal Thursday, Green Leader Elizabeth May says her party is prepared to defeat a government that priorities industry over the environment. 0:47\n\nThe Liberals might be persuaded to implement more aggressive climate policies \u2014 but would Trudeau walk away from the Trans Mountain expansion? After expending a lot of political capital and committing significant public funds to the project \u2014 and knowing how Albertans would react to its cancellation \u2014 it seems unlikely, at least.\n\nSingh's words on Thursday might suggest some room to negotiate. Perhaps the NDP leader could remain opposed to the expansion without without demanding that it be cancelled.\n\nThe electoral reform wild card\n\nBut Singh has laid out another condition already. Back in 2017, he told Fair Vote Canada that he would \"consult with our caucus and advocate for the inclusion of proportional representation as a condition of any alliance or support for a minority government.\"\n\nGiven Trudeau's publicly stated objections to proportional representation (and his misgivings about referendums), he might be just as unwilling to meet a demand for electoral reform.\n\nIt would be somewhat curious if the two parties that are most loudly in favour of proportional representation \u2014 the NDP and Greens \u2014 turned out to be rather uncompromising in their demands on a minority government.\n\nPart of the argument for moving to a system of proportional representation is that it typically would result in two or more parties having to work together to pass legislation. A campaign card recently distributed in the riding of Ottawa Centre by Fair Vote Canada, for instance, promises that proportional representation would mean \"co-operative decision making.\"\n\nIn the current circumstances, the prospect of a minority government seems instead to be producing a contest to decide which of the smaller parties can make the hardest demands.\n\nAbsent some post-election compromises, someone would be left having to explain why another election was necessary.\n\nBut all of this pre-result posturing for post-election negotiations might ultimately be for nothing.\n\nIt's still possible that one party will end up with a majority in the House of Commons. But there is also the distinct possibility that neither the Greens nor the New Democrats will be in a position to deliver pivotal votes to a minority government.\n\nAdvantage: Bloc\n\nBased on the latest polling, the Liberals would \u2014 if an election were held today \u2014 end up with 160 seats, 10 short of a bare majority. The Greens, with four seats, would be unable to offer a Liberal government a sufficient number of votes.\n\nThe New Democrats, with 16 seats, would be able to put the Liberals over the top. But so would the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, currently projected to win 17 seats.\n\nIndeed, while the Greens and New Democrats have been battling for position in British Columbia and Ontario, the BQ has quietly put itself in a position where it could have real influence in the next Parliament.\n\nSingh and May are no doubt free to stake out their negotiating positions now. But they might not even get invited to the table.", "description": "Current polls point toward the 2019 election delivering a minority government. How would that work?
