But if he doesn\u2019t want to fight he\u2019s calling out the likes of Frankie Edgar,\" Gaethje told ESPN.\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\n\"No disrespect to Frankie Edgar but he\u2019s 30 pounds lighter than us and that\u2019s a coward move.\n\n\"The man is a coward deep down. I know that, he knows that, some of us know that. And if I fight him I get to show the world that, and that\u2019s what he doesn't want.\"\n\nMcGregor is desperate to earn a rematch with Nurmagomedov but must first plot a route back into title contention.\n\nBut Gaethje has been left unimpressed by the Dubliner.\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\n\"He keeps tweeting he\u2019s gonna fight,\" said the American in an interview with TMZ Sports .\n\n\"I wrote him a message like f**king seven months ago just trying to be his friend.\n\n\"I\u2019ve tried every route. I\u2019m trying reverse psychology. I\u2019m trying to be his friend.\n\n\"I\u2019m trying every f**king route that there is to draw this man out and I can't draw him out.\"", "description": "McGregor has not fought since he was choked out by Khabib Nurmagomedov last October", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Zuffa Llc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20225987.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILE-Conor-McGregor-Retires-From-MMA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
