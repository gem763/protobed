At Gypsy Sport\u2019s out-of-office themed show, it was all about a beach body, with a glitter that would break the Kira Kira app. Several lucky models looked like beautiful aliens and were covered in ombre glitter from their head to their chunky Teva-ed toes. As Emilia Petrarca, our Fashion Writer said, \u201cEuphoria is shaking.\u201d\n\nModel and drag queen West Dakota opened the show with a sunset-inspired gradiant sparkle made of several tones of warm twilight. Sure to please the ecoconscious (and Sparkle Pony Burners), the glitter from company Bioglitz is biodegradable and even comes with a special algae-based glue for application. It only took about an hour and a half to brush on the glitter (which was set with hairspray). \u201cI found that it cleaned off easier than regular glitter. Regular glitter is plastic and has a lot of static which causes it to stick. It washed off pretty easily, with just soap and water. I have a little on me, but not as much. It\u2019s mostly in my bathtub,\u201d Dakota said. Shine responsibly.\n\nEbonee Davis Photo: Masato Onoda/WWD/Shutterstock\n\nWest Dakota Photo: JASON SZENES/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock", "description": "A review of the Spring 2020 Gypsy Sport runway beauty and makeup look, which was head-to-toe glitter courtesy of biodegradable glitter company Bioglitz.", "authors": ["Kathleen Hou"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/10/10-gypsy-sport-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
