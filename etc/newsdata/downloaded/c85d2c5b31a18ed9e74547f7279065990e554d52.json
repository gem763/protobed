He\u2019s full MAGA. He and the host, Garret Lewis, sneer at Paul Ryan and \u201cMartha\u201d for their repugnant RINO-ism. I\u2019ll support Trump on the border in whatever he wants to do, McCarthy stresses, even standing for days on end on the Senate floor in a filibuster if it\u2019ll help somehow. He\u2019s all for the border wall too. America First.\n\n\u2026but once we get done with the wall, he adds at 41:00 or so of the clip below, maybe we should think about inviting Mexicans to seek annexation by the United States.\n\nYeah.\n\n\u201cThere is a process to become states for the United States,\u201d McCarthy said Tuesday morning on an Arizona radio station. \u201cClearly 30 million Mexican illegal immigrants want to be United States citizens, probably half the country wants to be United States citizens.\u201d And so, the aspiring lawmaker from a border state would like the citizens of Mexico to turn their attention to Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution. It stipulates that \u201cnew states may be admitted by the Congress into this union.\u201d \u201cI want to speak above the Mexican government. Okay? When you\u2019re talking to the Mexican citizens, \u2018Rise up in your communities and petition to become states for the United States.\u2019 That\u2019s how that process works,\u201d he said, before adding that \u201cby the way, it\u2019s not that challenging.\u201d\u2026 \u201cListen, you think anybody wants to live like that?\u201d the wannabe senator told the show\u2019s host.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously joking,\u201d you\u2019re thinking. \u201cHe\u2019s mocking the left\u2019s attitude on immigration that we can and should absorb entire national populations with no unwelcome economic or cultural consequences.\u201d\n\nMy dude, he is not joking.\n\nThe campaign of Arizona Republican Daniel McCarthy tells RCP he is serious and that annexing Mexico is in line with an America First immigration policy.https://t.co/y35YJKYwsk \u2014 Philip Wegmann (@PhilipWegmann) September 18, 2019\n\nThe idea, I guess, is that annexation is a constitutional process and therefore allowing Mexicans to petition Congress for annexation would be a way to steer them towards *legal* immigration \u2014 of a sort. We dislike illegal immigration from Mexico, don\u2019t we? We\u2019re forever telling them to get in line, right?\n\nWell, what if 10 million or so got in line all at once, all on the same immigration \u201capplication\u201d?\n\nMaybe the idea is that if we convert parts of Mexico into U.S. states then the locals won\u2019t want to travel north anymore. They\u2019ll already be Americans! They can stay put. But of course, that\u2019s not why Mexicans cross the border. They do it chiefly for economic opportunity; so long as most of that opportunity continues to reside north of the Rio Grande, they\u2019ll want to reside north of the Rio Grande too.\n\nSo \u2026 what is he thinking? Ask the average MAGA fan why he opposes amnesty for illegals and he\u2019ll tell you that handing citizenship to millions of Mexicans would end up as a massive net electoral benefit to Democrats. Now here comes McCarthy with a bold new twist on that claim: Let\u2019s just hand electoral votes to entire Mexican provinces by converting them into U.S. states. No need to worry about Texas gradually turning blue anymore. We can simply gift-wrap a few dozen EVs for the Dems via annexation and let newly-minted Americans from former Mexico offset Texas\u2019s electoral power that way.\n\nOh, and as a cherry on top, McCarthy stresses that the border wall should be built before any discussions about \u201cMexit\u201d take place.\n\nWhy the hell would you want to spend money walling off a border that won\u2019t be a border anymore if annexation happens?\n\nI need a drink. I\u2019ll say this for the guy, though: There are all sorts of ideas that were anathema to the right just a few years ago that are now perfectly orthodox, mainly because Trump happens to back them. Look no further than the conundrum facing the country on how to handle Iran and its attack on Saudi Arabia. Five years ago, having the White House hold itself open to Tehran for talks after the regime bombed Saudi oil facilities would be seen by Republicans as one of the cuckiest displays of weakness in American history. Today, under the MAGA-in-chief, it\u2019s seen as cool-headed diplomatic prudence at a dangerous moment. There\u2019s probably some convoluted populist argument for why annexing Mexico is perfectly sensible too. And if there isn\u2019t yet, there will be.", "description": "Mexit?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/m-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
