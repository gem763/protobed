In comments to The Hollywood Reporter, NBC spokesperson Hilary Smith said the network is \"very confident\" in the 2018 report that resulted from an internal corporate investigation.\n\nMore: Ronan Farrow says NBC\u2019s alleged cover-up of sexual misconduct is \u2018bigger\u2019 than Matt Lauer\n\nMore: NBC releases Matt Lauer investigation, finds 'no evidence' leadership knew of misconduct\n\n\"This was a company where accusers with sexual harassment complaints were being paid out to sweep the problem under the rug,\" Ronan Farrow says of NBC's alleged cover-up. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY)\n\n\"We fired Matt Lauer within 24 hours of learning what he did, and promptly launched a corporate investigation,\" Smith told THR. \"Based on our investigative findings, we have swiftly taken appropriate actions to address the situation and improve workplace culture. It is also worth noting that this was a corporate investigation that was conducted by an almost entirely female team, none of whom are part of the News division.\"\n\nMore: Brooke Nevils says Matt Lauer is victim-blaming; second accuser calls his words 'triggering'\n\nThe investigation, led by NBCUniversal general counsel Kimberly Harris, found \"no evidence indicating that any NBC News or Today Show leadership,\" human resources or others \"in positions of authority in the News Division received any complaints\" about Lauer's workplace behavior until Nov. 27, 2017, just two days before his termination.\n\nIn his new book, Farrow, who won a Pulitzer for his reporting on the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct scandal, said NBC had received multiple complaints about Lauer before the one that resulted in his firing. Farrow, who took his Weinstein story to The New Yorker after NBC declined to run it, told USA TODAY that NBC has engaged in a cover-up and that the story is \"bigger\" than the allegations against Lauer.\n\nMore: Megyn Kelly calls on NBC to allow outside investigation into accusations against Matt Lauer\n\nNBC News President Noah Oppenheim disputed Farrow's allegations and says the author has an \"ax to grind.\" Lauer denied a rape allegation made in Farrow's book.\n\nBoth Kelly, who hosted an hour of \"Today\" before her departure last October, and former NBC News correspondent Vester called for an outside investigation during appearances on Fox News.\n\n\"The question is open to whether they put dollars ahead of decency. Were they more interested in protecting their star anchor over the women of the company?\" Kelly said. \"There needs to be an outside investigation in this company. They investigated themselves, that doesn\u2019t work.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/17/nbc-wont-authorize-outside-investigation-matt-lauer-allegations/4015268002/", "description": "NBC, which conducted an internal investigation of accusations against fired 'Today' host Matt Lauer, won't conduct a new investigation.", "authors": ["Bill Keveney", "Published P.M.
