In fact, City and United were meeting for the 21st time in a rivalry that dates back the best part of 30 years. But it was their first of the Women\u2019s Super League era and the first to be played in front of a crowd of anything like 31,213 people.\n\nThat attendance figure \u2013 nearly six times the previous WSL record \u2013 was greeted by almost as many cheers as the only goal of the game. Caroline Weir\u2019s spectacular drive at the start of the second half broke United\u2019s resolve and handed City all three points. The title contenders start with a win, their newly-promoted rivals can take hope from their display.\n\nBut for the women\u2019s game at large, that record figure of 31,213 is the most significant takeaway from the day.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But every last one of the thousands in attendance here at the Etihad were paying customers, suggesting that the surge in interest since Women\u2019s World Cup can be sustained.\n\nThe crowd were treated to a tight contest. United may be new at this level but Casey Stoney\u2019s squad possesses enough talent to finish in the top-half and shaded the opening 45 minutes. After recovering from an early injury scare to goalkeeper Mary Earps, United found a rhythm which unsettled their well-fancied opponents.\n\nLeah Galton\u2019s crossing posed particular problems, no more so than when she served the ball right at the feet of Jane Ross inside the six-yard box. Any kind of authoritative finish would have put United ahead but Ross\u2019 timid poke was easily saved, pushed away one-handed by Ellie Roebuck.\n\nThat was the chance, you felt, even after new signing Jackie Groenen and Jess Sigsworth came close to converting another Galton delivery a few minutes later. City were surprisingly sub-par and were still struggling to shift through the gears as the half went on, but they had at least seen off United\u2019s most dangerous attacking spell.\n\nWeir\u2019s goal, out of nothing, changed the dynamic of the game for good. It was a clean, pure strike by the Scotland international, still rising as it passed Earps\u2019 hand and found the far corner, but it was equally impressive for her clever reading of the play which preceded it, intercepting a slack Katie Zelem pass out from the back.\n\nCity asserted themselves from thereon and were comfortable, save for a comical late United chance. Groenen, a World Cup runner-up with the Netherlands this summer, spoiled one brilliant burst through City\u2019s ranks by tripping over her own feet. Aoife Mannion\u2019s attempted clearance then rebounded off Groenen, hit the post and trickled into Roebuck\u2019s arms.\n\nIt was a moment that could easily have turned this closely-contested derby on its head and an example of the drama we can expect to see on a weekly basis in an increasingly competitive division. The hope, now, is that many among the 31,213 who were here to witness it will return.", "description": "From the pre-match billing, you might have thought this was the first ever women\u2019s Manchester derby.
