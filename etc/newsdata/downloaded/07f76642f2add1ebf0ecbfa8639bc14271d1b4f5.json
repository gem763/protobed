(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nNormal presidents begin their terms by attempting to appear as if they represent the whole country. Trump has never made any effort in this regard.\n\n\u2018Without the ILLEGAL Witch Hunt, my poll numbers, especially because of our historically \u2018great\u2019 economy, would be at 65%,\u201d President Trump tweeted last week.\n\nIn all likelihood, the president believes what he wrote. It\u2019s a strongly held sentiment among many of Trump\u2019s ardent supporters that if he hadn\u2019t been stabbed in the back by the Deep State, the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller, and a complicit media, people would have realized by now that Trump is, as the actor Jon Voight recently put it, \u201cthe greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.\u201d Or at least they would give him a fairer shake than he\u2019s gotten.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it true that the president\u2019s poll numbers have suffered largely because of what he calls a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d?\n\nThe shortest and most accurate answer for this and all counterfactuals is, \u201cWe can never know.\u201d Still, there\u2019s ample reason to conclude the answer is, \u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\nThere are two mutually reinforcing reasons for this conclusion, one structural, the other specific to Trump. The structural explanation is that the electorate has been growing more polarized for decades, and the presidency had become a symbol in the culture war long before Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have been only a handful of times in recent decades when any president has enjoyed a supermajority of public approval. During wartime, for example, the rally-around-the-president effect often swamps partisanship. George H.W. Bush hit 89 percent after the first Iraq war, and after 9/11, his son reached 90 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther events can also goose approval ratings. Bill Clinton\u2019s highest approval numbers were reported on the day he was impeached (a fact House speaker Nancy Pelosi probably is thinking about as the House considers impeaching Trump). It\u2019s widely believed the bump in Clinton\u2019s polling was less a referendum on the president than on the effort to remove him. Barack Obama\u2019s best performance (67 percent) came four days after his inauguration, when many Americans were hopeful that his presidency could deliver on his campaign promise to put the culture wars behind us.\n\nIn all of these cases, however, the entropic effect of polarization reasserted itself as Americans divided back into Red and Blue teams. Obviously, events mattered. If, say, the second Iraq War had gone swimmingly, things might have been different, but there\u2019s little reason to believe the larger trend wouldn\u2019t have manifested itself again in time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the specific case. Trump won in 2016 by picking the lock of the Electoral College while losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. According to Gallup, he took office with an approval rating of 45 percent. His highest approval rating in Gallup\u2019s polling was achieved last month: 46 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe notion that the public would have come around to Trump but for the Mueller probe presupposes that the investigation is what made him unpopular, when all of the evidence suggests that the investigation was merely something that people who already disliked the president put their hopes in. When Mueller\u2019s finding that there was \u201cno collusion\u201d was released, Trump\u2019s approval rating went down, not up. Also, the fact that Trump enjoys majority approval for his handling of the economy even as his overall disapproval ratings stay high demonstrates that voters don\u2019t look only to economic indicators when judging presidents.\n\nThere is, however, one way in which the Mueller probe may have hurt him: his reaction to it. When impeachment loomed for Clinton, however much he was privately obsessed with it, his public position was to ignore it and at least seem like he was focused on the people\u2019s business. Trump went a different way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNormal presidents begin their terms by reaching across the aisle and attempting to at least appear as if they represent the whole country. They try to build on the coalition that elected them. Trump has never made any sustained effort in this regard. From his inaugural address onward, Trump has catered to his biggest fans and most ardent supporters.\n\nThis is a defining feature of Trump\u2019s character. The only people who matter are the ones who love him. And since his election, he\u2019s routinely mocked the idea that he should be \u201cpresidential,\u201d because his fans would find it \u201cboring.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine a world where the Mueller probe never happened. It\u2019s harder to imagine one where Trump isn\u2019t Trump, which is why 65 percent approval was never in the cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "description": "The economy may be good, but Americans look at many factors when rating the president.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
