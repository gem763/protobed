Sisak)\n\nThe revenue from the tax would be put toward creating new, union jobs (in green energy, health care and education), and \u201cworkers displaced by automation would go to the front of the line for these new positions,\u201d according to de Blasio\u2019s press release for the plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe de Blasio plan proposes several initiatives, including the creation of a new agency to regulate automation and oversee its impact, by requiring permits from companies increasing automation. Previously, the proposed \u201crobot tax\u201d has been discussed by business leaders such as Bill Gates.\n\nAndrew Yang is another 2020 Democratic candidate who has focused on this issue, proposing a national universal basic income ($1,000 a month for every U.S. adult citizen) to react to the negative impacts of automation.\n\n\"I don't care about what folks in Silicon Valley who are trying to justify that technology is somehow going to save us all,\" de Blasio told Carlson. \"You know, they're resting their laurels on the universal basic income.\"\n\nDe Blasio said while a universal basic income (UBI) may be part of the solution in some form, he sees it as a \"crutch\" to make the rich feel better. \"What it's going to lead to is a future without work. And the last thing we need-- I'm a progressive, I'm a Democrat, I believe in work. And I believe work gives people a lot of value, a lot of meaning. And we need to protect work in this country,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe de Blasio campaign claims the NYC mayor's policy is the farthest-reaching proposal of any 2020 candidate to address technology-related job losses.", "description": "A new \"robot tax\" is part of Mayor Bill de Blasio's plan to curb negative effects of automation if elected president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/615afb24de8ff410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____-China-Robots-Rising-3-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
