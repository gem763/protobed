Please sign it if you wish to repel the snivelling snowflakes & keep me in my job.\"\n\nIn another post, he added: \"Spread the word, my people\u2026 Sign, RT, and save me as your voice against the shriekingly illiberal liberals who want to cancel everyone who dares challenge them\u2026\"\n\nHe then followed on with another message thanking his followers.\n\nIt read: \"BREAKING NEWS: The petition to #SavePiers has reached 10,000 signatures & just overtaken the petition to have me fired. Took just 3hrs. See you on @GMB tomorrow & thank you, my p-p-p-p-people!\"\n\nThe petition already had 31,327 supporters on Monday morning, and is described as: \"Keep Piers Morgan for his common-sense approach to life. He\u2019s also funny!! \u2018He\u2019s not afraid to speak out and says what a lot of us are thinking.\"\n\nIt comes after he slammed the petition calling for him to be sacked from GMB after saying he identified as a penguin.\n\nHe made the claim as a reaction to a BBC film that says there are more than 100 genders.\n\nIn a tweet publicising the online petition, his view was called \"dangerous and dehumanising\".\n\nIn response Piers tweeted: \"You can't remove me, I'm currently identifying as a penguin so it would be animal cruelty.\"\n\nPoking fun at the petition he also shared a gif of a penguin adding: \"Memo to all those trying to get me thrown off TV for refusing to accept there are 100 genders.\"\n\nPiers said while he was a supporter of trans rights the film \"is doing more harm than good\".\n\nTransgender broadcaster India Willoughby joked: \"If the petition succeeds, @PiersMorgan should be replaced by a trans woman #NoLoyaltyInThisBiz #PiersMorgan .\"\n\nThe petition was launched by Liam Austen who wrote: \"In being an award-winning breakfast programme with a worldwide reach, one could presume that Good Morning Britain would act as an effective platform to educate the masses on these issues.\n\n\"In keeping Piers Morgan as the programme\u2019s main draw, however, ITV are actively choosing to promote an insidious agenda against transgender people (and minorities in general), as through his choice of language he regularly berates and mocks those who do not identify in a way he is willing to comprehend.\n\n\"Hate crimes are on the rise, transphobia and discrimination over gender identity is becoming commonplace both upon social media and in the real world, and ITV continue to sit idly and let it play out in the name of entertainment.\"\n\nPiers claimed he was a penguin after it was revealed a gay penguin couple had adopted a gender neutral penguin at a London aquarium.\n\nHe said: \"The world has gone nuts. I'm going to say that now I am identifying as a penguin and I demand to be allowed into the penguin enclosure at the aquarium and live with the penguins.\n\n\"This is the way the world is going, when I talk about this people go, 'You are so intolerant' and if you dare challenge these people they want you fired, expunged, sacked.\"\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs from 6am on weekdays on ITV", "description": "The outspoken host has begged his fans to help him keep his breakfast TV job by lending their signature to an online petition", "authors": ["Sara-Aisha Kent", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569187.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Screen-Shot-2019-10-13-at-003202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
