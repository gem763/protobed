The photograph was taken during a department open day. \u201cWe had issued such a police car and spread the contents next to it. Two policemen then had the idea to join in as well. The photo was finally taken with a drone.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Feuerwehr Thusis fire brigade take up the Tetris Challenge and layout all the content of their emergency vehicle. Here is what\u2019s inside a Swiss fire truck. Photograph: Instagram\n\nSoon other Swiss emergency response organisations, like the Thusis fire department, mimicked the Lego-set layout, in what has become known as the Tetris Challenge.\n\n\u201cWe were immensely happy and encouraged others to join us. It was followed by rescue services, fire departments, other police departments, but also private companies participated,\u201d Tilen says. From there, the challenge spread to the Netherlands, Hungary, Austria and Germany.\n\nThen, it went global with Singapore\u2019s civil defence force posting a gallery of emergency response teams in taking the challenge.\n\nFirst responders in Mexico and Taiwan also participated. Tilen says she had no problem convincing the original officers to take the photograph. \u201cIt is a self-runner. The different departments all over the world try to constantly confront each other with even more funny ideas.\u201d\n\nAlex Carmona (@Alexcarmonar) Para este 15 de Septiembre 2019 #TetrisChallenge #TetrisChallengeMexico un Fraternal Saludo\u00a1\u00a1 @DavidLeonRomero @rescateurbanomx @alertasurbanas @SASEMEP_IPN pic.twitter.com/BEGMwviMLy\n\nIn New Zealand, the police department created a near identical image in November 2018.\n\nThey subsequently reposted the image in response to the Tetris Challenge. In June, a review of the New Zealand police\u2019s social media use found that New Zealand police should post fewer memes and \u201cpuppy pics\u201d. In the audit, posts such as the #flatlay image above, were praised as \u201cgreat for viral pick up\u201d.\n\nTilen says: \u201cSince the challenge, our number of followers has once again increased and so our prevention campaigns and our witnesses searches have more reach, which is good for us.\u201d", "description": "From Switzerland to Singapore, police, fire and ambulance departments are laying down their tools, and their bodies, to take part in a new craze", "authors": ["Alyx Gorman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/116fc7ce33e0c44be9c309fe15298f23b13cc5f3/0_184_1559_935/master/1559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96e2fc93966041867da9845b5841169e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
