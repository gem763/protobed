Reno\u2019s new book, Return of the Strong Gods: Nationalism, Populism, and the Future of the West, is the dust-jacket photograph. It\u2019s a classical statue of a warrior-angel, sword in his hand. The message seems unmistakable: This is a heavy book about fearsome themes.\n\nYet anyone thinking\u2014or hoping\u2014that this book will be a hymn of praise for, say, the Roman god Mars, or Conan the Barbarian, will be disappointed.\n\nAs Reno writes, \u201cBy \u2018strong gods\u2019 I do not mean Thor and the other residents of the Old Norse Valhalla.\u201d Instead, he lauds the strong gods of \u201clove and devotion, the sources of the passions and loyalties that unite societies.\u201d Continuing in that irenic vein, Reno adds, \u201cTruth is a strong god that beckons us to the matrimony of assent,\u201d adding that strong gods \u201ccan be traditional\u2026the American Founding is a strong god worthy of our devotion.\u201d\n\nYet at the same time, Reno concedes that \u201cstrong gods\u2026can be destructive. In the twentieth century, militarism, communism, racism, and anti-Semitism brought ruin.\u201d So we can see that in the author\u2019s view, strong gods are prime movers\u2014the demiurges that inspire us to take action, for good or ill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus while Reno\u2019s strong gods are beneficent, that\u2019s not true of all strong gods\u2014and none of them should be trifled with.\n\nSo as we weigh risk and reward, we might be tempted to ask: Do we want strong gods in our midst? Would weak gods be preferable?\n\nAnswering that question is the task Reno takes up, and it provides, yes, a brooding, even primordial, backdrop to his tome. Indeed, World Wars I and II serve as his cataclysmic predicate:\n\nThe violence that traumatized the West between 1914 and 1945 evoked a powerful, American-led response that was anti-fascist, anti-totalitarian, anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist, and anti-racist. These anti imperatives define the postwar era. The End of American Public Virtue\n\nWhat is Classical Liberal History?\n\nIndeed, the world wars, and their associated isms, were so horrible that it evident that some sort of collective postwar course-correction was needed. And yet at the same time, we must remember that not everyone in the first half of the 20th century was guilty; there were plenty of good guys, as well as bad guys.\n\nThus we come to the heart of Reno\u2019s argument: The Western elites went from correction to over-correction. And in that over-correcting, the virtues of the strong gods were lost, or at least exiled. Reno sums up the thinking, after 1945 and to this day, of the great and the good:\n\nTheir aim is to dissolve the the strong beliefs and powerful loyalties thought to have fueled the conflicts that convulsed the twentieth century.\n\nAnd how will the elites go about dissolving the strong beliefs? The strong gods? With openness, that\u2019s how.\n\nReno thus warms to his theme: He starts with the emigre philosopher Karl Popper, who, in 1945\u2014even as the embers of war still burned\u2014published The Open Society and Its Enemies. Popper\u2019s two-volume work is an extended attack on \u201cclosed\u201d thinking, going back all the way to Plato. Such closedness, in Popper\u2019s view, was the prelude to intolerance, even totalitarianism. Comments Reno on Popper\u2019s gist: \u201cThe imperative is bracingly simple: Never again.\u201d Indeed, given the enormity of the wars and the death camps, we can detect a note of sympathy in Reno\u2019s voice.\n\nYet there\u2019s no sympathy when Reno sums up Popper\u2019s prescription: \u201cWe must banish the strong gods of the closed society and create a truly open one.\u201d\n\nIn fact, to Reno\u2019s distress, Popper went further, applying a materialist understanding to the course of events. \u201cAlthough history has no meaning,\u201d wrote Popper, \u201cwe can give it meaning.\u201d And here\u2019s where Reno draws his brightest line, because he is an unabashed\u2014albeit, at the same time, measured\u2014defender of Western Civilization and the Judeo-Christian tradition. Thus words such as \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201ctruth,\u201d and \u201ctranscendence\u201d dot his text.\n\nYet in the meantime, Reno chronicles Popper\u2019s dolorous influence: \u201cBy the late 1960s and early 1970s, Popper\u2019s open society had evolved to include open marriages, open drug use, and a general conviction that open discussion of the most intimate details of life would bring greater happiness and self-acceptance.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, Reno is fully mindful that Popper\u2019s ode to the open society inspired one of his students in London in the early \u201950s, George Soros. Upon leaving the academy, Soros became a speculator and made many billions; he is has since transferred much of his wealth to his many-tentacled Open Society Institute.\n\nReno further walks us through a terse but concise guide to other champions of openness, deftly weaving together such disparate figures as Albert Camus, Milton Friedman, Jacques Derrida, Friedrich Hayek, and Norman O. Brown. Of these, perhaps the most impactful has been Friedman, because the Nobel Prize-winning economist helped apply Popperian philosophy to the international economy. Reno argues that the result has been high economic growth\u2014but at an even higher societal price.\n\nTo clinch the case that Popper\u2019s ideas have had consequences, Reno cites President George H.W. Bush, speaking to the United Nations on October 1, 1990: \u201cI see a world of open borders, open trade, and, most importantly, open minds.\u201d Those words might seem woozily utopian today, and yet at the time, Bush 41\u2019s rhetoric seemed perfectly unobjectionable and normal\u2014and that\u2019s Reno\u2019s point: in the postwar era, the radical had been made to seem normal.\n\nIndeed, in the three decades since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the radical has become even more radical. As Reno describes today\u2019s zeitgeist: \u201cThe one-sided extremism of the open-society consensus\u2014punitive political correctness, undiluted liberalism, and unfettered free markets\u2014has done great damage.\u201d\n\nAs one can gather from his disdaining reference to \u201cunfettered free markets,\u201d Reno is an old-line conservative. Such paleoconservatism is quite distinct from the liberalism and libertarianism that has predominated in the open era, even if the distinctions have oftentimes been fudged over. In fact, using vivid language, Reno has been at pains to disentangle conservatism from the fusionism that has sought to blend hawkish foreign policy and libertarian economic policy\u2014along with, somewhere back in the caboose, conservative social policy. Fusionism might have made sense during the Cold War era\u2014Reno writes favorably, in fact, of William F. Buckley in his fusionist heyday\u2014and yet in the decades since, it has become a counterproductive god.\n\nYet while some paleocons might hanker for the truly old times, Reno inclines toward a distinctly mid-20th century policy vision, which he defines as \u201cmarkets moderated by government intervention and backstopped by social programs.\u201d Here we see the hand of Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, not Thomas Aquinas or Opus Dei.\n\nOf course, Reno is ultimately less concerned about policy; he is more interested in the metaphysical than the physical. He yearns for a return of \u201cthe Western tradition [that] has championed as fitting objects of our love\u2014not only God, but the nation and our cultural inheritance, even truth itself.\u201d\n\nIndeed, putting all his cards on the table, Reno adds, \u201cI am a Catholic. I\u2019d like to see a widespread revival of Christianity in the West.\u201d He argues that traditional faith \u201ccan make religious believers stable and stalwart citizens, less likely to be inflamed by ideological causes that are surrogates for true religion.\u201d\n\nIndeed, so true is Reno to his vision that he scorns not only the openness of liberals and libertarians, but also the certitudes of some others on the right. He derides those who draw their conservatism from \u201cthe perverse gods of blood, soil, and identity,\u201d seeing them as a throwback to the pre-1945 era. And he also rips those who are \u201ctoo likely to reduce classical questions of truth, beauty, and justice to the play of economic interests or to speculate about the blind cleverness of selfish genes.\u201d\n\nYet here it\u2019s possible to note a problem for Reno\u2019s argument. Yes, he\u2019s obviously right in his basic thesis: that the openness of the postwar era has become an emptiness. And yet at the same time, there are plenty of strong gods still on the scene, albeit many of them of a new kind. These Reno acknowledges when he writes of the \u201cparadoxically totalitarian culture of openness and weakness.\u201d\n\nYes, there\u2019s that strong god of political correctness, and alongside it, all the associated devils of domineering and dictatorial thinking, made all the stronger by new kinds of technology. Indeed, this author has speculated that the next wave of tyranny will be rooted not just in the human mind, but also in the computer mind.\n\nCan Reno\u2019s strong gods withstand the onslaught of the cyber gods? Can the old gods repel the assault of the new gods of Silicon Valley? And beyond the fight against American techsters, will the old truths be able to thwart, say, the Chinese Social Credit System?\n\nFor the faithful, there\u2019s hope eternal. Yet between today and eternity, a great struggle looms. So as the tech hordes amass their might, believers must gird their loins, because the 21st century will bring trials to rival the 20th century.\n\nJames P.
