Five-hundred thousand customers had their power switched off Tuesday but a later set of cuts to around 250,000 additional customers was delayed, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe precautionary approach \u2014 which has been met with outcry about its scope \u2014 came after a massive blaze, thought to have been sparked by downed power lines, ravaged parts of Northern California last year.\n\nThat fire was the deadliest and most destructive in the state\u2019s history.\n\nSouthern California Edison, another one of the state\u2019s main electricity providers, said it planned to cut power for more than 100,000 customers, CNN reported.\n\nOn Monday, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo told residents to be prepared to go without power for much of the week, according to CNN.\n\n\u201cGiven the prolonged period during which the wind event will unfold, and the large number of power line miles that will need to be inspected before restoration, customers are being asked to prepare for an extended outage,\u201d PG&E said in a news release. \u201cPG&E will work with state and local agencies to provide updated restoration timelines following the conclusion of the severe weather event.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Heartbreaking Photos Show Devastation of Camp Fire in California as Death Toll Rises to 71\n\nFirefighters work on a controlled burn at a wildfire, in Magalia, Calif. in 2018 | John Locher/AP/REX/Shutterstock More\n\nNews of the outages struck a chord among affected residents. State Sen. Jerry Hill of San Mateo told the L.A. Times that he believed the utility company was being unreasonable with the number of areas it planned to cut.\n\n\u201cI think it is excessive,\u201d Hill told the newspaper. \u201dPG&E clearly hasn\u2019t made its system safe. These shutdowns are supposed to be surgical. But shutting down power to 800,000 people in 31 counties is by no means surgical.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Daring Rescues and Devastating Destruction: See the Most Shocking Photos of the California Fires\n\n\u201cThis cannot be something that can be acceptable nor long-term,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is Third World, and we are not.\u201d\n\n#PSPS: Additional proactive shutoffs for safety will begin later this afternoon and into early evening in portions of these counties (see table).

Many schools and businesses closed down in anticipation of the cuts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable. There\u2019s no wind. It\u2019s nothing. There\u2019s no reason why they should shut the power off,\u201d Joseph Pokorski, a retiree living in Sonoma, told ABC. \u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 closing everything down so they don\u2019t get sued. They don\u2019t trim the trees, so we suffer.\u201d\n\nRELATED: See the Moment a Nurse Drives Through Flames to Help Patients During Deadly California Wildfire\n\nIn its release, PG&E advised residents to plan for medical needs, identify backup charging methods for their electronics and to restock emergency kits with flashlights, fresh batteries, first aid supplies and cash.\n\nOn Tuesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom voiced his displeasure with the company\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cNo one is satisfied with this,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one is happy with this.\u201d", "description": "Californians Lose Power in Outages to Prevent Wildfire", "authors": ["Jason Duaine Hahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wn12KSDt69.Ez2b8R9S0Hw--~B/aD0xMzgwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/e1fa571a41341aa83aab29b9f1570462", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
