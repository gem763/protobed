Senator Sanders, I want to start with you,' co-moderator Erin Burnett directed to the progressive candidate as she moved on from the issue of medical marijuana.\n\n'I'm healthy. I'm feeling great,' Sanders interrupted, which was received with laughter and cheers from the audience.\n\n'And Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana. I want to make sure that's clear as well,' Booker jested.\n\n'I'm not on it tonight,' Sanders insisted and went on to share his views on medical marijana and the opioid epidemic.\n\nBernie Sanders took the debate stage Tuesday night in his first campaign-related event since his heart attack earlier this month\n\nQuestions emerged over Sanders' age and ability to handle the office of the presidency after he admitted a packed campaign and rally schedule had him more 'fatigued' than usual ahead of his heart attack.\n\nIn his first interview after his surgery, Sanders said he 'misspoke' when he said he was fatigued and said he would be returning the the campaign trail 'soon' and run an even more 'vigorous' campaign than before.\n\n'Senator, we are all very glad you're feeling well,' Burnett responded after he concluded his answer on opioids.\n\n'As you just said. But there is a question on a lot of people's minds, and I want to address it tonight,' she continued. 'You're 78 years old, and you just had a heart attack. How do you reassure democratic voters that you're up to the stress of the presidency?'\n\n'Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we're having in Queens, New York,' he said, and then prompted supporters to visit his campaign website for details. 'We're going to have a special guest at that event, and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.'\n\n'But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes,' Sanders continued. 'And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.'\n\nHe appeared fit and reinvigorated alongside the 11 other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates in Westerville, Ohio Tuesday night as he attempted to shift the conversation away from the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump\n\nSanders (left), Joe Biden (center) and Elizabeth Warren (right) are the three front-runner candidates, but also the oldest of the 20 Democrats running for the primary. Sanders in 78, Biden 76 and Warren 70. All three, if elected, would be the oldest president inaugurated for their first term in U.S. history\n\nBurnett also asked former vice president Joe Biden whether he could handle the office of the presidency being inaugurated at the age of 80 and Elizabeth Warren at the age of 71.\n\nSanders, Biden or Warren, if elected, would all be the oldest president ever inaugurated in their first term in U.S. history.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, a more longshot candidate and Hawaii representative, is 38-years-old and would be the youngest candidate ever elected to the White House if she succeeds in 2020.\n\nEven though Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, said Democrats have 'no choice' but to impeach Donald Trump, he made it clear he didn't want to make combatting the current president the focus of his campaign.\n\n'I think it's absolutely imperative we go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached,' Sanders said. 'But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump.'\n\n'We cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country,' he added.\n\nHe also asserted that it would be a mistake for Democrats to forget about issues million of Americans face like those who have insufficient health insurance or are uninsured and those who are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\n'We cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country,' Sanders said.\n\nSanders admitted he felt more 'fatigued ' than usual ahead of his heart attack, but walked back on that claim saying he would run a more 'vigorous' campaign than before. Here he is pictured with his wife Jane Sanders following a surgery earlier this month where he had two stents implanted to clear a clogged artery in his heart\n\nSanders has also used his heart attack scare to promote his Medicare for all proposal, which he claimed during the fourth debate Tuesday night that his plan would be 'better than the Canadians.'\n\nIn a video released last week, where the candidate appeared more muted than his usual fired-up self, he said he couldn't imagine going through what he did in Las Vegas, Nevada earlier this month if he wasn't insured by both his healthcare through the Senate and Medicare.\n\n'As somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I said, let's be clear. Under the Medicare for All bill that I wrote, premiums are gone. Co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone,' Sanders said. 'We're going to do better than the Canadians do. That's what they have managed to do.'\n\n'At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills,' he continued in his answer that was limited to a one minute and 15 second response. 'I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They will go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody, the tax increase will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out of pocket expansions.'\n\nSanders is one of a dozen Democratic candidates who appeared on the debate stage in Westerville, Ohio Tuesday night for the fourth primary debate. The first questions of the night allowed each of the 12 on stage to address the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump.\n\nOhio is a swing state that voted in favor of Trump in 2016, with 51.3 per cent for Trump and 43.2 per cent for Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe House announced it was launching an impeachment inquiry at the end of September after it was revealed Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings there.", "description": "Bernie Sanders returned to the debate stage Tuesday night - just a little over two weeks after suffering a heart attack - hoping to deflect the message away from impeaching Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com In Westerville"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/03/19768802-0-image-a-14_1571192180139.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
