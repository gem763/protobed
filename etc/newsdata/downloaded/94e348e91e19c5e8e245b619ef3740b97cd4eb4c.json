That means the cities on our list saw many more people move out since 2010 than move in.\n\nRead more: The 20 US cities where everyone's moving to \u2014 and they're nearly all in Florida\n\nWhile these cities saw big hits to their population from people moving out, many had much lower levels of overall population loss, and a few actually saw their populations increase between 2010 and 2018. Those offsetting increases came from the other main source of population change: natural change, or net births minus deaths. While many people left these cities, plenty of those who stayed kept having kids.", "description": "Using US Census data, we found metro areas with the most negative net migration between 2010 and 2018.
