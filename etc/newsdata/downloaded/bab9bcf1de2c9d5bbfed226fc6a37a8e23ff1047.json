The judge wants to know how many acres burned, what buildings were damaged or destroyed, the exact cause of the fires and when they happened.\n\nPG&E has a week to respond to the judge\u2019s order.\n\nAdmitting to causing the damage could be costly for the beleaguered PG&E, which already agreed in June to pay $1 billion to local governments in parts of California that were affected by a series of wildfires started by downed power lines.\n\nThe company also reached an $11 billion settlement last month over claims related to 2017\u2019s northern California wildfires and the 2019 Camp Fire, which killed 85 and was the deadliest wildfire in state history.\n\nBill Johnson, PG&E\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement that the settlement was \u201canother step in doing what\u2019s right for the communities, businesses and individuals affected by the devastating wildfires.\u201d\n\nAlsup was already overseeing a case with PG&E related to a 2010 pipeline explosion when The Wall Street Journal published an investigation in July that found the utility company knew power lines in northern California could start wildfires, but delayed repairs for years.

The company listed assets of $71.39 billion and liabilities of $51.69 billion.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "A judge has ordered PG&E to provide specifics about fires it may have caused.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/11/0/0/campfire3-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
