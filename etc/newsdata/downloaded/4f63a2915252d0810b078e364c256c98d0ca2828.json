I don't agree with the verdict.\"\n\nJohnson said the government would respect the ruling, adding that the \"most important thing\" is that the UK leaves the EU on October 31, \"come what may.\"\n\nJohn Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, addresses reporters after the Supreme Court ruled that Boris Johnson's decision to prorogue Parliament was unlawful.\n\nFollowing the judgment, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, said Parliament would resume on Wednesday from 11:30 a.m. local time (6:30 a.m. ET).\n\nWith Johnson in New York, Bercow said there would be no Prime Minister's Questions -- normally held on Wednesdays -- but that there would be opportunities for urgent questions, ministerial statements and emergency debate applications.\n\nThe House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, will also resume on Wednesday, at 3 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET).\n\nContentious decision\n\nJohnson's decision to suspend parliament until mid-October was hugely contentious. Opposition lawmakers accused him of trying to shut down political efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit on October 31.\n\nThe government insisted the prorogation was constitutional, and normal procedure when a government wants to restart the parliamentary session with a new legislative agenda.\n\nREAD LADY HALE'S FULL SUMMARY OF THE COURT'S DECISION HERE:\n\nUK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn called for Johnson to reconsider his position \"and become the shortest serving Prime Minister that has ever been.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Labour conference in Brighton, Corbyn added that Johnson must \"obey the law, take no deal off the table and have an election to elect a government that respects democracy that respects the rule of law and brings power back to the people, not usurps it.\"\n\nTuesday's decision follows last week's high-stakes hearing in the Supreme Court, at which the justices were asked to decide between competing decisions of Scottish and English courts.\n\nThey upheld a case brought in Edinburgh by a cross-party group of more than 70 lawmakers led by Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry. They agreed with the Court of Session that Johnson's suspension of Parliament was motivated by the \"improper purpose of stymying Parliament.\"\n\nAt the same time, they overturned a ruling by the High Court in London, which found against the anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller. The High Court had earlier ruled that the decision to suspend Parliament was a political matter, and not one that could be reviewed by the courts.\n\nMiller's legal action was joined by John Major, treating Britain to the extraordinary spectacle of a former Conservative prime minister suing his successor.\n\nSpeaking outside court following the ruling, Cherry told reporters that she was \"absolutely delighted that the UK Supreme Court has agreed with Scotland's Supreme Court.\"\n\nSNP MP Joanna Cherry speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court in central London.\n\nShe added: \"This is a huge victory for the rule of law for democracy and it's very much in keeping with Scottish constitutional traditions that neither of the governments nor indeed the monarch are above the law.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Brexit coordinator for the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt tweeted that \"the rule of law in the UK is alive and kicking\" after the decision.\n\n\"Parliaments should never be silenced in a real democracy,\" he added. \"I never want to hear Boris Johnson or any other Brexiteer say again that the European Union is undemocratic.\"\n\nAt least one big relief in the Brexit saga: the rule of law in the UK is alive & kicking. Parliaments should never be silenced in a real democracy.\n\n\n\nI never want to hear Boris Johnson or any other Brexiteer say again that the European Union is undemocratic. \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) September 24, 2019\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify what the ruling said about the reasons Boris Johnson gave to Queen Elizabeth II for the prorogation of Parliament.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's controversial five-week suspension of Parliament was unlawful, the UK Supreme Court has ruled, in a landmark decision that will have far-reaching constitutional implications.", "authors": ["Bianca Britton", "Sheena Mckenzie"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190924085245-boris-johnson-0920-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
