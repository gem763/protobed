I wish the NBA would acknowledge that,\u201d Pompeo said Friday.\n\nThe NBA's starts and coaches have been uncomfortable, unwilling or unable to discuss the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and mainland China's human rights abuses, and now the league is shutting down discussion altogether.\n\nSTEVE KERR SAYS HE HASN'T BEEN ASKED ABOUT US 'HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES' WHEN ASKED ABOUT CHINA\n\nThe league announced Friday it will not hold any media availability for the rest of its Chinese jaunt, a day after Beijing prohibited any kind of news conference before or after a preseason exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets.\n\n\u201cWe have decided not to hold media availability for our teams for the remainder of our trip in China,\u201d the league said in a statement. \u201cThey have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real-time.\u201d\n\nThe NBA made the decision independent of the Chinese government, ESPN reported.\n\nANDREW YANG RIPS CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S 'RIDICULOUS' DECISION NOT TO BROADCAST NBA GAMES\n\nThe tension between the league and China started earlier this week after Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager Daryl Morey tweeted from his personal account a pro-Hong Kong message ahead of the Rockets' own preseason trip to Japan.\n\nThe NBA has tried to do damage control but instead has only caused more outrage by appearing to abandon western values to placate China.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe league took more heat Thursday after a Rockets official shut down a CNN reporter\u2019s question --about the fallout from the tweet --to stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook.
