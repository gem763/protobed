Bush and slated to start in the new year, would have all but ended the era of the incandescent bulb invented more than a century ago. Eliminating inefficient bulbs nationwide would save electricity equivalent to the output of at least 25 large power plants, enough to power all homes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, according to an estimate by the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nThe Trump administration said the changes would benefit consumers by keeping prices low and eliminating government regulation.", "description": "In 2007, a bipartisan Congress said that requiring energy efficient light bulbs was the right idea.
