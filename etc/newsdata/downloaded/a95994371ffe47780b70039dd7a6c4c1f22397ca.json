Dr Queloz also works at the University of Cambridge in Britain.\n\nUsing custom-made instruments at their observatory in southern France in October 1995, Dr Mayor and Dr Queloz were able to detect a gaseous ball similar in size to Jupiter, orbiting a star around 50 light years from our own Sun.\n\nHarnessing a phenomenon known as the Doppler effect, which changes the colour of light depending on whether an object is approaching or retreating from Earth, the pair proved the planet, known as 51 Pegasus b, was orbiting its star.\n\nThe Nobel jury noted that the discovery \"started a revolution in astronomy\" and since then over 4,000 exoplanets have been found in our home galaxy.\n\n\"Strange new worlds are still being discovered,\" challenging our preconceived ideas about planetary systems and \"forcing scientists to revise their theories of the physical processes behind the origins of planets.\"\n\nIn a statement, the two astronomers hailed their win as \"simply extraordinary\", saying the discovery was \"the most exciting of our careers\".\n\nThe prize consists of a gold medal, a diploma and the sum of about US$914,000.\n\nThe trio will receive the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.\n\nIn 2018, the honour went to Arthur Ashkin of the US, Gerard Mourou of France and Donna Strickland of the US for laser inventions used for advanced precision instruments in corrective eye surgery and in industry.\n\nThis year's Nobel prize season kicked off on Monday with the Medicine Prize awarded to Americans William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza, and Britain's Peter Ratcliffe.\n\nThey were honoured for research into how human cells sense and adapt to changing oxygen levels, which opens up new strategies to fight such diseases as cancer and anaemia.\n\nThe winners of this year's Chemistry Prize will be announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe Literature Prize will follow on Thursday, with two laureates to be crowned after a sexual harassment scandal forced the Swedish Academy to postpone the 2018 award, for the first time in 70 years.\n\nOn Friday the action moves to Norway where the Peace Prize is awarded, with bookies predicting a win for Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg on betting sites such as Ladbrokes.\n\nThe Economics Prize will wrap up the Nobel prize season on Monday, October 14.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Life & Culture - [STOCKHOLM] Canadian-American cosmologist James Peebles and Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz on Tuesday won the Nobel Physics Prize for research that increases the understanding of our place in the universe. .
