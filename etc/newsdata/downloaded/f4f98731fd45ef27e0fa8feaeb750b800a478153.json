If one team hoards too many good players, as Golden State did while reaching the last five NBA Finals, it leaves a lengthy list of clubs who have no realistic hope of contending for a title.\n\nBut if it only takes a pair of All-Star players, that opens the door for teams who already have two, or have one and the assets to get another.\n\nThe Big Three model kept some of those teams from going all in, but that era appears over.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the way the league just went,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it was done purposefully, but I think this is maybe the most exciting the league ever has been in a while. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\n\nJames won rings with two versions of a Big Three, teaming with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh for back-to-back titles in Miami, and then rallying Cleveland to the 2016 championship along with Irving and Kevin Love. Now he\u2019ll try to do it with one fewer, which might be enough if the Lakers put the right pieces around him and Davis, who are two of the top players in the league.\n\nSo are Leonard and George. Doc Rivers coached a Big Three to the 2008 title in Boston with Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, and the Celtics might\u2019ve won another if not for the Heat building a younger one two years later.\n\nNow he\u2019ll try to win with two, with a Clippers team that George thinks looks like many other teams in today\u2019s NBA.\n\n\u201cI think what Boston did was special. I think what Miami did was special,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it goes back to you have two guys that are the guys and then you have a group around them that supports them to the highest level, and that foundation is around a lot of guys in this league.\u201d\n\nThough the focus has been on the tandem of twos, George said a number of teams could point to a complementary player and say they have a Big Three. Houston is one of them, coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said when asked the reason for the trend.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is media-driven in the sense of we\u2019ve got Eric Gordon. He\u2019s a superstar,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cEric Gordon\u2019s as good as anybody in the league. So you focus on, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve only got two,\u2019 because that\u2019s the named two. But probably money and cap does create an equal system for everybody.\u201d\n\nTrying to afford three top players and keep them for long became even more challenging only a year after James and Bosh went to Miami, with the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement implementing severe penalties for teams who exceed the luxury tax. Short of players sacrificing salary, as Tim Duncan repeatedly did in San Antonio when the Spurs kept him, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili together long enough to win four titles, it\u2019s almost impossible to get three stars and a competent cast around them.\n\nEven if the salaries work, the personalities might not. It\u2019s hard to keep three alpha dogs happy, as Irving showed by asking out of Cleveland, especially because one of them usually has to give up so much of his game so three isn\u2019t a crowd.\n\n\u201cYou have a guy that\u2019s used to being a focal point of the offense - take Bron\u2019s teams in Miami,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cThere\u2019s more sacrifice I think probably to be had if it\u2019s a Big Three versus a Big Two, but that would be my two cents on it.\u201d\n\nAnd his two cents on the two-man trend?\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got the best of them, of all the duos,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Brian Mahoney on Twitter at https://twitter.com/briancmahoney\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In today's high-stakes NBA, a powerful pair beats three of a kind.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/lakers_warriors_basketball_59156_c0-139-3322-2076_s1200x700.jpg?0b684fdbb1d9ad7d37c3fa5347eff77594992855", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
