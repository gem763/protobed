Has it intensified in recent years due to harsher sanctions being imposed on North Korea?\n\nA still image taken from video footage shows a boat with Russian border guards sailing toward a North Korean vessel to detain it and crew members for poaching in waters that Moscow considers its exclusive economic zone, released by Russia's Federal Security Service on September 27, 2019. Federal Security Service/Handout via REUTERS\n\nArtyom Lukin: North Korean poaching in Russian coastal waters in the Sea of Japan dates back decades, but over the past two or three years the scale of this practice has increased remarkably, leading to a small crisis in the waters of the Russian Far East.\n\nSince June, hundreds\u2014by some accounts even thousands\u2014of North Korean schooners and motorboats have illegally entered Russia's exclusive economic zone to fish, mostly for squid. Apart from fishing without authorization from Russian authorities, the North Korean flotillas use destructive fishing methods like drift nets, which severely harm the marine environment by indiscriminately catching and killing many different species.\n\nTo top it all off, local Russian fishermen also accuse the North Koreans of damaging or stealing their fishing gear in the process.\n\nThere are several reasons for the recent dramatic increase in North Korean marine poaching.\n\nThe harsh sanctions that have been imposed on North Korea since 2016, combined with bad weather conditions, have resulted in poor harvests in 2018 and 2019. While not nearly as severe as the famine of the mid-1990s, which killed hundreds of thousands or perhaps even millions of people, North Korea seems to be experiencing another period of food shortages.\n\nThis raises demand for whatever food can be brought in from the sea, but the country's own coastal waters are largely depleted, so North Korean fishermen head east across the maritime boundary into nearby Russian waters where fish stocks, especially squid, are relatively plentiful. Most of the squid that the poachers catch in Russian waters is meant for the North Korean domestic market, but some portion of it may also be sold to China.\n\nWhile North Korea officially remains a socialist country with no private property, it has developed a quasi-capitalist economy in which some sectors, such as fishing, heavily rely on de facto private enterprises. This partial marketization of the economy has accelerated under North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who came to power in 2011.\n\nThe boats that poach in Russian waters are officially assigned to state entities, but in fact they are privately owned. Their crews risk their lives, venturing out into Russian waters in rickety wooden boats, because for them it is probably the only way to earn income and support their families.\n\nNorth Korean authorities are perfectly aware of the large-scale poaching by their fishermen in Russian waters, but so far they have done nothing to stop it, partly because they can't offer alternative sources of income\u2014and thus, survival\u2014to fishing communities on North Korea's northeastern coast. The state also stands to benefit, as government officials are known to take a cut from the poachers' revenue.", "description": "Russia is detaining North Korean fishermen for poaching squid, and while it may not affect their broader ties, it's not clear they'll find a solution.", "authors": ["The Editors", "World Politics Review"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9df83c3b33a727b5389c65?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
