Harry, the iconic figurehead of Blondie, tells her tumultuous tale in Face It.\n\nHarry\u2019s book attempts to look at what it is to understand yourself, to grow up and make sense of a confusing world, a quest that is also apparent in the new autobiography from comedian Lenny Henry and in the fictional journey of Lyra Belacqua, the central character in Philip Pullman\u2019s latest novel The Secret Commonwealth.\n\nRacism is another theme linking some of the leading books this month. One of Smith\u2019s stories is about an immigrant who is brutally murdered in the late 1950s. Henry grew up in that Windrush era and he discusses bigotry in modern Britain, including the issues raised by the treatment of Grenfell Tower residents. Former teacher Pullman names a character after GCSE student Nur Huda el-Wahibi, one of the victims of that tragic fire.

Shape Created with Sketch. 25 books that should have never been made into films 1/26 Warner Bros Pictures/Universal Pictures/New Line Cinema 2/26 Dune (1984) Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie \u2013 and David Lynch\u2019s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director's adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It's the only one of Lynch's films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year\u2019s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better. Universal Pictures 3/26 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma's preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production's many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon's follow-up book, The Devil's Candy. Warner Bros 4/26 Billy Bathgate (1991) 1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow's beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character's narration \u2013 a huge reason behind the novel's success. Buena Vista Pictures 5/26 The Scarlet Letter (1995) The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as \u201ca perfect work of the American imagination,\" the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joff\u00e9 strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne's pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama. Buena Vista Pictures 6/26 Battlefield Earth (2000) To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard\u2019s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in \u201cWorst Movies Ever\u201d infamy, effectively ending Travolta\u2019s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper\u2019s before it even started. Warner Bros Pictures 7/26 Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001) Louis de Berni\u00e8res's Captain Corelli's Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version \u2013 from the same British company that made Notting Hill \u2013 lost all traces of the novel's heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake. Miramax Films 8/26 The Time Machine (2002) The beauty of HG Wells\u2019s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells's great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce's lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story. Warner Bros Pictures 9/26 Dreamcatcher (2003) There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film's late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful. Warner Bros Pictures 10/26 Enduring Love (2004) Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u2019s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig\u2019s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed \u2013 the man who becomes obsessed with him \u2013 are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it. Path\u00e9 Distribution 11/26 The Perfect Catch (2005) Nick Hornby adaptations don\u2019t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby\u2019s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a 'girlfriend\u2019 role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby\u2019s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing. 20th Century Fox 12/26 The Da Vinci Code (2006) The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels & Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn't have existed had this one not been so successful. Sony Pictures Releasing 13/26 Eragon (2006) 20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation \u2013 one where all of the source materials' sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen. 20th Century Fox 14/26 Running with Scissors (2006) Augusten Burroughs\u2019s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy\u2019s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It\u2019s no wonder this sunk without a trace. TriStar Pictures 15/26 The Golden Compass (2007) In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman\u2019s superb His Dark Materials trilogy \u2013 or rather, the first book Northern Lights \u2013 was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007's The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising. Entertainment Film Distributors 16/26 The Time Traveller's Wife (2009) Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger\u2019s The Time Traveller's Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there's nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. New Line Cinema 17/26 Cloud Atlas (2012) Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it's meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell's sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it's an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it. Focus Features 18/26 The Hobbit (2012-2014) Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson \u2013 but that\u2019s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book's material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three. Warner Bros Pictures 19/26 The Book Thief (2013) The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn't help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent. 20th Century Fox 20/26 The Great Gatsby (2013) No adaptation of The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann's 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald\u2019s delicate story-telling. Warner Bros Pictures 21/26 The Giver (2014) Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein\u2019s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Katie Holmes) very little to do. The Weinstein Company 22/26 Kill Your Friends (2015) John Niven's Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can't be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows \u2013 the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox. StudioCanal 23/26 The Girl on the Train (2016) Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn\u2019s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance \u2013 and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. Universal Pictures 24/26 Me Before You (2016) The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn't help, either. Clarke's performance as the paid companion to Claflin\u2019s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated. Warner Bros Pictures 25/26 The Dark Tower (2017) While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King's finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared \u2013 but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel's 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Sony Pictures Releasing 26/26 On Chesil Beach (2017) Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in \u2013 the Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007). Lionsgate 1/26 Warner Bros Pictures/Universal Pictures/New Line Cinema 2/26 Dune (1984) Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie \u2013 and David Lynch\u2019s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in \u2013 the Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007). Lionsgate\n\nPullman\u2019s fantasy novel reflects the chaos of modern times. The fractured 21st-century world continues to offer inspiration to acclaimed writers such as John le Carr\u00e9, whose new novel Agent Running in the Field features controversial topics such as Brexit, Donald Trump and the growing threat from Moscow.\n\nHere\u2019s our review of five books published in October 2019.\n\nFace It by Debbie Harry \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had one f**k of an interesting life,\u201d says Debbie Harry in her memoir, which is truly a tale of sex, drugs and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Given some of the revelations about heroin and cocaine use in Face It, one can only be thankful that it isn\u2019t a scratch and sniff publication.\n\nAs Blondie, singer and actress Harry was one of the most original and successful female singers of the 1970s. Her tales of stardom are amusing \u2013 Phil Spector\u2019s idea of showing a girl a good time was doing impressions of comedian WC Fields and then running a gun down Harry\u2019s thigh-high leather boots and saying \u201cbang, bang\u201d \u2013 but the most affecting parts of her autobiography are about growing up. She was a child in an era of \u201cfewer distractions\u201d, with time for day-dreaming.\n\nHarry had to endure creeps from an early age, whether that was strangers flashing at her (when she was just eight), or when she and a friend were hit on (as pre-teens, mind) by two strangers in their late thirties. One turned out to be the acclaimed jazz musician Buddy Rich, the hero of many drummers Harry would later get to know. Although Harry describes the first penis-waving flasher as a \u201cpervert\u201d, she is more forgiving about the time a coked-up David Bowie \u201cpulled out his cock\u201d, adding, \u201che loved to pull it out with both men and women. It was so funny, adorable and sexy.\u201d\n\nThere are other oddities in a ghost-written book which is \u201cbased on a series of recent exclusive interviews\u201d. Harry repeats the claim that she had a lucky escape from a car driven by serial killer Ted Bundy. \u201cMy story has been debunked since, because Bundy is said to have been in Florida at that time and not NYC. But it was him,\u201d she insists.\n\nFor Blondie fans, Face It is rich in interesting snippets, fan art and even Harry\u2019s poem about the 9/11 tragedy. The singer admits to \u201cmood swings\u201d, says she is \u201cpro-ecology and anti-Trump\u201d and defends her choice of plastic surgery because it \u201cmakes you feel better\u201d. She adores wrestling. It is well documented that Harry worshipped Marilyn Monroe, but few would have guessed that this new wave/punk singer\u2019s favourite soundtrack album is the bluegrass O Brother, Where Art Thou?. She also writes with genuine passion about her love of the jazz musicians Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, Fats Waller and Ornette Coleman. The singer admits she only appeared on The Muppet Show because Dizzy Gillespie had done so before her.\n\nHarry is admirably candid about her flaws and failings \u2013 \u201cwe got taken\u201d she admits, about the time she ended up broke, owing the IRS thousands \u2013 and ponders wryly on the \u201coften-boring openness\u201d of the digital age. \u201cToday it\u2019s all about being famous. But in those days it was about making things happen,\u201d says Harry, who was a bona fide trailblazer.\n\n\u2018Face It\u2019 by Debbie Harry is published by HarperCollins, \u00a320\n\nGrand Union by Zadie Smith \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nZadie Smith, the author of White Teeth, has been writing short stories since she was at university, but Grand Union, a collection of 19 stories, is the first published collection in that format. Smith\u2019s dialogue crackles with mordant wit \u2013 \u201cyou turn everything into a funeral\u201d an adolescent girl says to her mother in the opening story \u201cThe Dialectic\u201d \u2013 and even minor characters are dissected with great skill. A \u201cpissy\u201d sales assistant in the tale \u201cMiss Adele Amidst the Corsets\u201d, \u201cmoved with an angry slouch, like a prisoner\u201d. Everything has \u201cstopped making sense\u201d for the outdated Miss Adele, who is sick of millennials. She mocks twin brother Devin for his \u201cthree-kids-and-a-labradoodle, don\u2019t-panic-it\u2019s-organic\u201d existence. Even when the subject matter is bleak, Smith is fun to read.\n\n\u201cBig Week\u201d, about a disgraced American cop called Mike McRae, captures the poignant truth of this flawed man through the insights offered in a piercing short finale to the story. In a moving segment, 56-year-old Marie reflects on bringing up a family and why she did not settle anymore for living with her ex-husband. \u201cTime began to cautiously reshape itself around her broken body, and she found she wanted to be alone with it once more,\u201d writes Smith. In \u201cWords and Music\u201d, two old dames are \u201clong freed of useless men\u201d.\n\nSmith casts a humorous and unsentimental eye on characters throughout Grand Union. Middle-aged dread seeps into \u201cSentimental Education\u201d. \u201cNext stop Canonbury. Next stop menopause and no more denim,\u201d Monica thinks to herself while on a train journey. The special wit in Smith\u2019s writing is that she makes the end of denim the point of no return. She is an author who is in tune with the melancholy of modern life, whether that is through young adults owing vast sums in student loans, or the \u201cgeneral malaise\u201d of people addicted to \u201cexhausting\u201d social media.\n\nThe memorable \u201cThe Lazy River\u201d slices through the Brexit mess (\u201cthat bad-faith moon of 2017\u201d) in one biting, amusing story about the class divisions revealed on a package holiday to Spain. The minority, who warn their children off the endless chips and who apply the highest-possible factor of suncream, are swimming against the current. But they are not immune from Smith\u2019s droll mockery. \u201cEven in the water they like to maintain certain distinctions. They will not do the Macarena,\u201d the narrator notes.\n\nLondoner Smith always writes interestingly about her home city and in the deceptively simple final story, \u201cGrand Union\u201d, which is only around 930 words long, she explores family emotions against the backdrop of a canal near Ladbroke Grove.\n\nThe saddest tale is \u201cKelso Deconstructed\u201d. Smith\u2019s mother Yvonne reminded the author about the real-life murder of Antiguan immigrant Kelso Cochrane, who was 32 when he was knifed by drunk white youths in Notting Hill in May 1959. They were out to make trouble for \u201cspades\u201d. The account of Kelso\u2019s final day, which ends at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in Paddington, is delicate and mournful.\n\n\u201cKelso had no final thoughts,\u201d writes Smith. This dazzling collection of stories will leave you with plenty to think about.\n\nGrand Union is published by Hamish Hamilton, \u00a320\n\nWho am I, again? by Lenny Henry \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nLenny Henry was only nine-months-old when Kelso Cochrane was stabbed and the comedian grew up in our sometimes tawdry post-war racist culture, where insults such as \u201cnig-nog\u201d and \u201ccoon\u201d were depressingly familiar. It was also a time when landlords could display with impunity the sign \u201cNo Blacks, No Irish, No Dogs\u201d. \u201cYou were buggered if you were a black Irish wolfhound\u201d, jokes Henry (faithfully crediting Kim Fuller with the line).\n\nThe memoir, which recounts Henry\u2019s life up to around 1980, is reflective and depressing. Henry discusses how black comedian Charlie Williams would tell jokes against himself. The survival method of the time was to \u201cget all the dodgy racist jokes in before they did\u201d. As Who am I, again? makes clear, humour was Henry\u2019s default \u201carmour\u201d against prejudice, although he did once brawl with a fellow welder apprentice who called him a \u201cblack c**t\u201d.\n\nHenry admits that he \u201cburied his head in the sand\u201d by appearing on The Black and White Minstrel Show for five years. \u201cThe BBC doesn\u2019t like to acknowledge its involvement with The Black and White Minstrel Show now that it has turned out to be an embarrassment,\u201d he adds. His affable public persona did not guarantee freedom from abuse. After photographs of the house he shared with his wife Dawn French were printed in a tabloid newspaper, the racist symbol \u2018NF\u2019 was smeared in excrement on their front door. Reflecting on the ongoing effects of the Windrush scandal and treatment of Grenfell Towers victims, Henry notes sadly that \u201cI wish I had stood up to racism more\u201d.\n\nSome interesting subjects are left unexplored, though. Expressing admiration for 1960\u2019s Bill Cosby is understandable \u2013 and would have been a common emotion for rising comedians back then \u2013 but Henry offers no thoughts on the subsequent vile revelations about one of his heroes.\n\nThe most entertaining aspects of the book, which includes graphic novel-style strips illustrated by Mark Buckingham, are Henry\u2019s touching memories of his upbringing and the potent language he heard as a child, including the exclamation \u201cwha\u2019 kinda raas clart fuckery is dis?\u201d. Although he grew up in Dudley in the West Midlands, he says that \u201cfor all intents and purposes I was a little Caribbean kid\u201d, although probably the only one doing impressions of a Jamaican Scooby-Doo.\n\nHe writes openly about discovering that his father Winston (a man who let his nails grow \u201cCatweazle long\u201d) was not his biological parent. Some of the grimmest parts of Who am I, again? are about his mother Winnie. She was a woman with \u201cpowerful hands\u201d who was a \u201cbrutal\u201d disciplinarian. \u201cI grew up with beatings\u2026 my mother hit me in the face with a frying pan,\u201d reveals Henry. Sometimes slapstick is just not funny.\n\nWho Am I, Again? is published by Faber & Faber, \u00a320\n\nThe Secret Commonwealth: The Book of Dust Volume Two by Philip Pullman \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nLyra Belacqua, the fearless, truth-seeking heroine of the fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials, is one of Philip Pullman\u2019s most appealing characters and one he returned to after his famous trilogy was completed in 2000. Lyra was most recently seen as a baby in 2017\u2019s La Belle Sauvage: The Book of Dust Volume One. In the gripping second instalment of this planned trilogy, Lyra reappears as a 20-year-old Oxford student who is going by the name Lyra Silvertongue.\n\nThe publishers state that The Secret Commonwealth \u201ccan be read as a standalone\u201d, but the 686-page novel will clearly provide more riches to those familiar with the past of the bold Lyra (\u201clike a half-wild cat\u201d), who is played by Dafne Keen in the forthcoming BBC adaptation of His Dark Materials.\n\nThe Lyra at the heart of The Secret Commonwealth is a troubled, uprooted young woman, who is worried that she is a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d after falling out with her daemon Pantalaimon. Pullman presents a vivid portrait of an anxious young woman, who is journeying towards a mysterious desert in Central Asia. \u201cShe trembled on the edge of vertigo,\u201d is how Pullman puts it.\n\nThe novel contains more daemons, witches and alchemists than you can wave a magic stick at, but although it is fantasy, the novel is also, says Pullman, an exploration of the struggle between a despotic organisation, which wants to stifle enquiring minds, and those who believe thought and speech should be free.\n\nThe tension is kept tight. Lyra is in danger and fearful of a world \u201cbecoming more unstable by the day\u201d. As you would expect from part two of a trilogy, the book ends with everything still in the balance.\n\nThe Secret Commonwealth is published by David Fickling Books in association with Penguin, \u00a312.30\n\nTwas The Nightshift Before Christmas by Adam Kay \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nAdam Kay follows up his bestseller This Is Going to Hurt with a book of festive tales from his career as a junior doctor. It seems Christmas is also a time when objects that should be left in the pantry end up in the orifices of people who then rush to A&E.\n\nTwas The Nightshift Before Christmas is probably not a book to read aloud to your granny, although the account of what happened to the hip-hop singer who paid a sex worker to stick pins in his penis is enough to make anyone\u2019s mince pies water. Life lessons from Kay abound. It is wise to save tinfoil for cooking the Turkey rather than sexual mummification \u2013 and definitely don\u2019t use candy cane as a dildo or peanut butter as a lubricant. The book should make even the hardest heart melt in respect for the poor night-shift nurses who are left to clean up these messes while working absurdly unsociable hours for small pay.\n\nAnd who knew about the middle-class pastime of Christmas Eve granny-dumping? Kay says it\u2019s common for people to \u201cbring elderly or infirm relatives into hospital with some vague, fabricated medical complaint, so the dumpsters can dedicate their next few days to partying.\u201d\n\nKay\u2019s book is amusing, engagingly written and strangely cheery. It\u2019s certainly informative. I now live in hypochondriac dread having learned that \u201cfainting while having a piss is surprisingly common in men\u201d.\n\n\u2018Twas The Nightshift Before Christmas is published by Picador on 17 October, \u00a39.99", "description": "Roberta, a character in Zadie Smith\u2019s captivating new collection of short stories, says she knew Debbie Harry back in the old New York East Village days. \"Whatever happens to old punks?\" she muses.\u00a0\"Enquiring minds want to know.\u201d Well, they go on to publish their life stories.", "authors": ["Martin Chilton"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/15/indybest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
