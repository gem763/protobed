It was enough to torpedo her finances and before long the heating was off, vegetables were dropped from meals and the house grew filthy because she could not afford cleaning products.\n\n\u201cIt is designed to make it difficult so that they can get as many people off it as they can,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lucy Morris failed to check a box on the universal credit online form and lost a \u00a3400 payment.

He showed wage slips that proved the pay was reported wrong, but jobcentre staff could do nothing. Food ran low, he broke down mentally and ended up homeless and estranged from his family.\n\n\u201cThe DWP staff appeared to be in thrall to the UC computer, allowing it to make all the decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing able to tackle the computer beast that had made this decision wasn\u2019t within their capability.\u201d\n\nMary Blyde, a 61-year-old with incontinence and learning difficulties, was discovered by a charity worker lying in her unheated home in Gateshead on a urine-soaked sofa after her benefit was cut. She had missed a note on her online account warning her she needed to take action. When a charity worker found her, all that was left in her cupboard were three potatoes, a can of meat and a carton of orange juice.\n\n\u201cSometimes I get scared the money won\u2019t come into my bank,\u201d she said.\n\nThese are some of the lives that campaigners warn risk being forgotten as the government and its technology industry partners pour millions into automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning in the benefits system.\n\nCruel and chaotic? No, in the DWP\u2019s fantasy land, universal credit is a huge success | Polly Toynbee Read more\n\nThe strategy might seem inevitable, welcome even, given its spread to other walks of life. How we use transport, watch TV and use email are all increasingly shaped by AI. Many UC claimants welcome the ability to communicate digitally rather than waiting on hold on the phone. Ministers argue digitisation will make claiming benefits more straightforward, reduce fraud and save money.\n\nThe DWP\u2019s last annual report claimed investment in digital technology \u201cimproved the experiences of people who rely on our services, making us more effective and efficient, and enabling us to personalise delivery for customers and claimants\u201d.\n\nThe ministry tries to create an atmosphere that will attract programmers to develop technologies for a welfare system that is used by 20 million people. There is an \u201cinnovation dojo\u201d to investigate new technologies, and its \u201cintelligent automation garage\u201d \u2013 an echo of Google\u2019s Digital Garage training centres which began in sunny California \u2013 is looking for ways to leverage the \u201cDWP data lake\u201d for \u201cimproved citizen outcomes\u201d, albeit based in a grey government building in north Newcastle.\n\nBut many see the reforms as erecting digital walls around the welfare state which are now only scalable by the computer literate. A further digital transformation with robotic automation and machine learning will only make things worse, they fear.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Abraham was denied a month\u2019s benefits because an automated system linking salary data from HMRC with the DWP misreported his previous income.

The waste from the mistakes is many times more [than the savings]. We are seeing more and more people because they have tried online and can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nShe recalled a released prisoner who dropped in recently for help signing on for UC, could not cope with the system and said he wanted to go back inside. \u201cHe kicked off, the police came and he was arrested,\u201d she said.\n\nCharities are trying to help. Blyde, for example, relies on Gary Fawcett at the Your Voice Counts in Gateshead. He has spent 155 hours on her case, remarking: \u201cIt almost broke our project.\u201d\n\nA recent exchange on her online journal was telling. She had already lost almost \u00a31,000 in benefits because she did not know she needed to input more data, so he asked the DWP to tell her about future problems by post.\n\n\u201cMary CANNOT read or access her journal in any way,\u201d he wrote on her journal. \u201cI can no longer be sorting this out for her.\u201d\n\nThe reply came: \u201cWe do not communicate by letter \u2026 this is an online service.\u201d\n\nFawcett said again she could not access, read or input into the journal. He asked: \u201cWho is supposed to do this?\u201d\n\nThe DWP replied simply that the online system needed updating, signing off: \u201cPlease do this ASAP.\u201d\n\nFawcett is also trying to help Julian Jennings, 65, who cannot read or write, has learning difficulties and does not even know he is on UC.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Julian Jennings: \u2018I used to go to the dole. It was much easier.\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\n\u201cI have never used a computer in my life,\u201d he said as he sat at Fawcett\u2019s desk with his UC account screen open. \u201cI used to go to the dole. It was much easier. You talked about it and signed it. If there were any problems they used to sort it.\u201d\n\nThere is a message from a UC official: \u201cHello Julian. Please read the attached letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t read none of that,\u201d he said, peering at the screen. \u201cHow are you supposed to get your money?\u201d\n\nBlyde and Jennings are among 1.5 million people in the UK with learning difficulties and are not alone in struggling with the system. Tears filled the eyes of Danny Brice, 47, in London when he showed the Guardian how difficult he has found negotiating the UC programme with learning difficulties and dyslexia.\n\n\u201cI call it the black hole,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel shaky. I get stressed about it. This is the worst system in my lifetime. They assess you as a number not a person. Talking is the way forward, not a bloody computer. I feel like the computer is controlling me instead of a person. It\u2019s terrifying.\u201d\n\nNine million people in the UK are functionally illiterate and 5 million adults have either never used the internet or last used it more than three months ago.\n\nAnd yet many of these people rely on a \u201cdigital by default\u201d welfare system.\n\nThe DWP said that humans remain available to help: \u201cWe continue to invest in frontline colleagues, from phone lines to work coaches to front of house staff,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cThis means people who struggle with digital services, or are worried about a wrong decision, can get the help they need. And because we know that, for whatever reason, some people don\u2019t want to come into a jobcentre, we are funding Citizens Advice to help support people with their claims.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nathalie Nasor at Oasis Community Housing has been helping a client with mysterious benefits cuts which seem to be the result of the system combining different databases. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nNathalie Nasor, a crisis case worker at Oasis Community Housing in Gateshead, has been helping Gary Warburton, 56, a former industrial cleaner who has been on UC since 2017. They have struggled with mysterious cuts to his benefits which seem to be the result of the system combining different databases.\n\nHe recently lost sums which turned out to be repayments for a crisis loan which dated back to 1997, an overpayment of tax credit five years ago, magistrates court fines and council tax arrears.\n\n\u201cIt drives you absolutely cuckoo,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are things from 1998. They control you and don\u2019t give a hoot what happens to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis anxiety and mood went to an all-time low,\u201d said Nasor.\n\nThe digital system has been very good for fraudsters. Staff have already made 42,000 referrals for fraud, the government has said. Kasim Mahmood, 32, a supermarket worker with Asperger\u2019s in Manchester, was one victim.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kasim Mahmood, who was defrauded by someone via Snapchat. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nIn July he was approached on Snapchat by someone offering him extra cash. As asked, he provided his address, national insurance number and driving licence, and \u00a31,525.44 landed in his account. The fraudster had applied for a UC advance payment \u2013 essentially a loan \u2013 and it had arrived fast. He threatened Kasim with violence if he did not send half. So now Mahmood was in debt and his existing benefits were stopped because the DWP computer thought he was receiving universal credit.\n\n\u201cI would struggle to get any benefit, yet there are people out there who get it at the click of a finger as long as they know their way around the digital system,\u201d said his mother, Rucksana Mahmood. \u201cThere are some things we have to move forward digitally and others keep in the old fashioned way.\u201d\n\nLast year the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, Philip Alston, warned that the postwar British welfare state was disappearing \u201cbehind a webpage and an algorithm\u201d and that the impact on the human rights of the most vulnerable would be \u201cimmense\u201d. The then chancellor Philip Hammond said his report was \u201cnonsense\u201d.
