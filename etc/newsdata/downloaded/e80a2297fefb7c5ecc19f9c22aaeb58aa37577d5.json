And, in some cases, gathering data for Facebook\u2019s researchers.\n\nThe researchers aim to create smarter, more intuitive A.I. that understands human beings the way human beings really talk. We don\u2019t say, \u201cHalt and await further command.\u201d We say, \u201cHey, hang out here a minute.\u201d And by that we don\u2019t necessarily mean one actual minute .\n\nResearchers call this kind of communication \u201cnatural language.\u201d\n\nIf the Minecraft project works out, it could feed into a wide-ranging effort across industry, academia, and government to develop computer assistants that seamlessly integrate into people\u2019s daily lives.\n\n\u201cAt a high level, what we care about is how can A.I. agents understand what people want them to do, especially communicated in natural language,\u201d Arthur Szlam, head of the Minecraft project at Facebook Research, told The Daily Beast.\n\nMinecraft is both simple and complex. Its graphics are crude on purpose. The basic actions a player can take also are fairly simple. Walk. Dig. Craft. Hit.\n\nBut the ways in which a player can interact with the game\u2019s endlessly-generating world essentially are limitless. In Minecraft you can build almost anything you can imagine, from underground lairs to castles in the sky. You can grow crops, raise animals, tame fire, and channel water.\n\nThat makes Minecraft a great proving ground for A.I. agents, Szlam said. \u201cBecause the players are so creative, the space of tasks a player might want a bot to accomplish in Minecraft is huge,\u201d Szlam told The Daily Beast. \u201cOn the other hand, the game world is relatively simple in terms of physics and state representation, et cetera.\u201d\n\nThe game\u2019s simplicity makes it easier for Szlam and his team to translate an A.I.\u2019s interactions with the player and the world into code. It\u2019s \u201cscriptable,\u201d Szlam said, \u201cand it simplifies perception.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that Minecraft, which Swedish developer Mojang launched in 2009, seems ready-made for A.I. experimentation. Microsoft bought Mojang and Minecraft in 2014. The software giant didn\u2019t just want Minecraft for its commercial potential.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Research has thrown a lot of support behind Minecraft as an A.I. research tool,\u201d Matthew Guzdial, a Georgia Institute of Technology gaming researcher, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThus there are many tutorials and competitions to help structure research.\u201d\n\nMojang didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message seeking comment for this story.\n\nGuzdial said he expects Facebook\u2019s Minecraft bots to learn fairly quickly to understand many basic commands from most players. \u201cIt could certainly [understand], \u2018Go fight that zombie,\u2019 or, \u2018Build a tower 15 blocks high.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut complex tasks might prove impossible with today\u2019s code. \u201cFor example, I expect an A.I., even given years of training data, to struggle with a command like, \u2018Make a statue of Iron Man and the Hulk fighting,\u2019\u201d Guzdial said.\n\nEven if the Minecraft bot doesn\u2019t quickly learn to understand complex commands and complete big tasks, as it listens and interacts with more and more players, it just might surprise people. \u201cWe hypothesize that these interactions can lead to emergent effects,\u201d Szlam said.\n\nIn other words, the bot just might learn to really understand what players want when they shout, vaguely and with less than perfect grammar, \u201cTake out that dang baby zombie over there!\u201d\n\nAnyone can download the bot here. For everyday players, the A.I. runs on the game\u2019s own servers. Szlam said his team doesn\u2019t gather any data from those players. \u201cWe can\u2019t even detect someone running it.\u201d\n\nBut the whole point of the project is to gather data that can help Szlam and his fellow researchers code smarter A.I. To that end, Facebook Research pays some players to run a version of the bot that resides on Facebook\u2019s own servers. Szlam and his team periodically harvest the data from those players\u2019 interactions with the bot and use it to improve the overall code for the A.I.\n\nThat bifurcated scheme could change, Szlam said. \u201cEventually, if we can make the bot good enough, we would like to open servers to the public. If and when we do that, we plan to give players control over whether or not their playing data is logged and used for this research, and we do not plan to pay players to interact with the bot.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict how smart Facebook\u2019s Minecraft bot will become. And Szlam said it\u2019s too soon to say what Facebook eventually might do with the underlying code. \u201cWe have just put together the scaffolding for this project,\u201d he told The Daily Beast, \u201cnow we have to do the actual work.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that a whole lot of entities\u2014from corporations and universities to government agencies and even the military\u2014are eager to develop intuitive A.I. for a wide range of applications. And consumers remain interested in smart computer assistants that understand the way people really talk.\n\nGuzdial sees a long road ahead. The Minecraft bot might take us just a few steps farther. \u201cI expect that no A.I. trained in Minecraft will make it into a product,\u201d Guzdial told The Daily Beast. \u201cInstead this project is about developing ways of training A.I. that can be tested in Minecraft, but will have to be retrained and deployed in other real-world domains.\u201d\n\nThere is one possible immediate benefit, Szlam pointed out. \u201cOutside of our research goals, we very much hope that people will have fun playing with the bots.\u201d", "description": "The social media giant turned to the blocky, endless virtual world for research into natural language processing.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568144841/190910-axe-facebook-minecraft-hero_s65tzg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
