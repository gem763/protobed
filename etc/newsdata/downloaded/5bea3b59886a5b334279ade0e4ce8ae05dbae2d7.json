Protectionism detracts from growth and punishes consumers and business.\n\n\"But protections are different. They are the insurance we take on to reduce uncertainty, strengthen confidence, manage risk and support enterprise.''\n\nCarr calls policy shift 'spin'\n\nMr Albanese also used the speech to recast Labor's climate change pitch towards one of job creation by heralding a manufacturing boom that could emanate from the transition towards renewable energy.\n\nThe shift in policy emphasis is starting to rankle internally with senior Senator and Left factional figure Kim Carr openly questioning the post-election epiphany of Mr Albanese and senior shadow ministers. He called the message shift \"spin\".\n\n\"Not one of those senior people argued against the policies at the time, not one of them,'' said Senator Carr, who believes Labor should keep the policy agenda it took to the election.\n\n\"Not one of them in the shadow cabinet spoke or voted against them. No one opposed the spending on schools, on hospitals, on childcare workers, on the environment, on the defence policies or any of the other commitments that we made.\n\n\"You can argue that we\u2019ve got to spend less, that\u2019s a reasonable proposition, but you\u2019ve got to say where we should spend less, and how that would then end up defining the Labor Party.\"", "description": "Accepting workforce casualisation was here to stay, the Labor leader said the industrial relations system needed to protect those who chose to work multiple jobs, such as those in the gig economy, as well as those who did not..", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3077%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_33%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f2a367de50288ce251f721c6c0e573980a67bff4", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
