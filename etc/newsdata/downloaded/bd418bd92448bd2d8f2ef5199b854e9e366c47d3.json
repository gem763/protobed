I\u2019m Martin Farrer and it\u2019s my pleasure to bring you the top stories this morning.\n\nBoris Johnson and Donald Trump were all smiles yesterday as they gave a joint media conference in New York. But neither the British prime minister nor the president of the United States has much to laugh about today as they face mounting domestic political crises that threaten their positions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson and Donald Trump in New York yesterday.

The humiliated prime minister has been forced to cut short his visit to the United Nations in New York and return home after the Speaker, John Bercow, said the ruling by the 11 judges meant that parliament would be reconvened today. Jeremy Corbyn was consulting with fellow opposition leaders last night about how to ensure the PM cannot escape the legal obligation passed earlier this month to delay Brexit if he hasn\u2019t reached a deal by 19 October. MPs want Johnson to face questions on this in the Commons today, although a Downing Street source said it was not clear if the PM would do so and it\u2019s not clear what happens next in parliament. Johnson, who maintains he will not seek a Brexit extension even he can\u2019t push a deal through parliament, tried to strike a defiant tone after the ruling, saying that he disagreed with the judges but that \u201cwe respect the court\u201d. Tory Brexiters rallied around their leader, as did some newspapers.\n\nJeremy Corbyn tried to capitalise on the government\u2019s predicament by bringing forward his Labour conference speech by a day and issuing a rallying cry to the party to \u201cwin an election for the people of this country\u201d. Here are the five key takeaways from his rousing address in Brighton.\n\n\u2018No one is above the law\u2019 \u2013 Back across the pond, Trump faces perhaps the most serious threat to his presidency yet after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she would begin a formal impeachment inquiry. Amid allegations that the president tried to engage Ukraine to smear Joe Biden, Pelosi said: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Democrats, who control the House, said they had no choice after the White House refused to comply with requests for information and testimony about the reports.\n\nThe move comes in the wake of whistleblower allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate the business dealings of the son of Joe Biden, the former vice-president and the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential election. Trump dismissed the possibility of impeachment as a \u201cwitchhunt\u201d and his allies now plan to use the inquiry to their advantage. The increasing calls for impeachment will focus on electoral rules that prevent any party receiving a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign government. Tom McCarthy explains how the impeachment process might work and what happens next.\n\nThe computer will see you now \u2013 Artificial intelligence is on a par with human experts when it comes to making medical diagnoses based on images, according to a new study that will add to the growing excitement about the capability of computers in healthcare. AI interpretation of medical images relies on feeding information into algorithms and has shown promise in diagnosis of diseases from cancers to eye conditions. But the authors of the study from Birmingham university cautioned it was a reality check for the hype around AI.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Michael Buckner/BMA2015/Getty Images for dcp\n\nBeauty myth \u2013 The advertising watchdog has banned two beauty salons from using ads on Instagram that imply their products can make customers look like Kylie Jenner. AKJ Aesthetics and Queen of Aesthetics used images of Jenner, the youngest of the Kardashian reality TV clan, to promote cosmetic filler products. But the Advertising Standards Authority says the ads \u201cmisleadingly suggested their packages would give customers lips, cheeks and jawline\u201d like Jenner, a cosmetics billionaire who has 150 million Instagram followers.\n\nMental health concerns \u2013 Psychiatrists have called for a public inquiry after inspectors found 28 privately run mental health units to be \u201cinadequate\u201d in the past three years. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has rated 16 independently run mental health units as inadequate so far this year. It put four others in the same category last year, and eight in 2017.\n\nFleaing the nest \u2013 Two days after her stunning triple triumph at the Emmys, Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge has announced that she has signed a deal to produce exclusive content for Amazon Prime. The actor and writer says she is \u201cinsanely excited\u201d to continue working for the entertainment arm of the global shopping site, which already screens Fleabag in 200 countries. But her decision bears out warnings by Channel Four boss Alex Mahon and former BBC boss Mark Thompson about the loss of homegrown British talent to overseas rivals.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: \u2018The effect on democracy was extreme\u2019\n\nPhilippe Sands QC on the decision by the supreme court to rule against the government on the suspension of parliament.

Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images\n\nLouis Tomlinson says he wasn\u2019t ready for the breakup of One Direction and a solo career outside the boyband bubble. The death of his mother Johannah from leukaemia a year later and his sister from an accidental overdose in March this year has left him facing a \u201cdark side\u201d, he tells our interviewer Emine Saner. But the personal tragedy he has suffered \u201cgives me strength everywhere else in my life\u201d, he says, and \u201cit makes everything else, not feel easier and not less important, but \u2026 you see things for what they are\u201d. His solo career is blossoming with a new single and, if not yet as successful as his former bandmates Harry Styles and Niall Horan, he is philosophical: \u201cI\u2019ve never been competitive like that, but, naturally, you think: \u2018If they\u2019re getting this then I deserve that.\u2019\u201d\n\nSport\n\nPlans by the IOC to introduce stricter guidelines for transgender athletes before the Tokyo 2020 Games have run into the sand because its panel of scientists is struggling to reach agreement on the issue. Tottenham are out of the Carabao Cup after being beaten 4-3 on penalties by Colchester United, whose giantkilling exploits left a subdued Mauricio Pochettino wondering when his underperforming side will rediscover their sense of unity. There were no such upsets for Manchester City, Arsenal and Southampton. Eddie Jones has bristled at the suggestion he is taking a risk by naming Billy Vunipola to start for the second time in five days against the USA at the Rugby World Cup, and issuing a stark warning to the 10 new faces in his England side. At the Road World Championships, the women\u2019s time trial, won by Chloe Dygert, and the men\u2019s under\u201123 event, won by Mikkel Bjerg, were both hit by extreme weather that made conditions in Harrogate \u201clike riding into a lake\u201d. Manchester United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has offered Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r his long-term backing in response to the manager\u2019s mixed results at the start of the season. And Andy Murray claimed his first ATP Tour singles victory since January by beating Tennys Sandgren in the opening round of the Zhuhai Championships.\n\nBusiness\n\nThomas Cook directors could face legal action in the wake of the collapse of the travel company which left more than 150,000 Britons stranded abroad. Investigations will focus on the conduct of the board and the last three chief executives, who were paid a total of \u00a335m in the years before the firm went bust with debts of \u00a31.7bn. The auditing firms responsible for signing off the company\u2019s accounts will also face scrutiny. There are also fears that Wrightbus, the Northern Ireland bus maker, could follow Thomas Cook into administration today. The US impeachment threat and Trump\u2019s own anti-China rhetoric at the UN gave the markets in Asia a fright overnight, leading futures trade to point to a 0.25% drop on the FTSE100 this morning. The pound is buying $1.246 and \u20ac1.299.\n\nThe papers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nFleet Street has ruled unanimously that the best story in town is the supreme court ruling. The Guardian\u2019s headline is \u201cHe misled the Queen, the people and parliament\u201d, while the Times says the \u201cPM flies back to chaos\u201d. The FT goes with \u201cJohnson faces calls to resign as judges rule parliament\u2019s closure \u2018unlawful\u2019\u201d. The i picks up on the calls to quit as well, saying \u201cHumiliated PM refuses to resign\u201d. The Scotsman has a striking front page, with a full-page photograph of Johnson\u2019s face in black and white with the headline in red text: \u201cUnlawful\u201d. The Mirror also prefers a slightly different approach and announces, below a gallery of the shortest-serving PM\u2019s in history: \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in history waiting for you, Prime Minister\u201d.\n\nHowever, not all papers paint such a bleak picture for Johnson. The Telegraph\u2019s headline quotes the prime minister\u2019s defiant words \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s be in no doubt, there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit\u2019\u201d, while the Mail says \u201cBoris blasts: who runs Britain?\u201d and the Express asks rhetorically: \u201cUnlawful? What\u2019s lawful about denying 17.4m Brexit!\u201d The Sun, meanwhile, summons the catchphrase of 70s comedian Dick Emery to try to capture the national mood: \u201cOoh, you are lawful\u2026 but we don\u2019t like you!\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
