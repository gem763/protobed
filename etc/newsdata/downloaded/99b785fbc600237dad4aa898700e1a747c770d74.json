OK?\u201d said Rep. Max Rose, D-N.Y., about when House Democrats need to begin public hearings in the impeachment inquiry. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you could get much more out of me than that.\u201d\n\nRep. Max Rose, D-N.Y. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: house.gov) More\n\nRose is among a small band of centrist House Democrats whose views are thought by many to be key to the fate of the impeachment inquiry. A 32-year-old veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Rose last year knocked off a Republican incumbent in a conservative, Trump-friendly district that encompasses the GOP stronghold of Staten Island. He is precisely the sort of precarious freshman who Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been trying to protect for much of the year by resisting calls for impeachment.\n\n\u201cThere was a point in time, not very long ago, I said, \u2018Look, with the facts that we have today, I do not think impeachment is the correct road to go on,\u2019\u201d Rose said in an interview for the Yahoo News \u201cSkullduggery\u201d podcast. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that when new facts present themselves that we shouldn\u2019t consider an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nRose is now trying to walk a fine line: He made waves recently by announcing his support for the inquiry, but won\u2019t commit to actually voting for impeachment itself. Still, he was struck by Taylor\u2019s powerful testimony this week that an \u201cirregular\u201d foreign policy driven by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani led the president to demand that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cgo to a microphone\u201d and publicly announce investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as one into supposed Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, as a condition for the reinstatement of $391 million in U.S. military aid.\n\nBut Rose says he wants to reserve judgment on whether to vote in favor of impeaching Trump. \u201cWe are not jumping to any conclusions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an investigation. This is an inquiry and we are looking to rise above politics.\u201d\n\nWhile Rose wants the hearings to begin a public phase very soon \u2014 precisely the argument being used by GOP critics of the investigation \u2014 he still believes his Republican colleagues are playing politics with the issue.\n\n\u201cWe could have selected ... Mother Teresa to lead this inquiry and I guarantee you [House Republicans] would still be parroting the same exact talking points,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThis is about deflection. This is about trying to distract the American people. So they distrust the process to the point that they do not even believe in facts. ... They are choosing to take the route that in my book is not patriotic and that is absolutely wrong.\u201d\n\nDownload or subscribe on iTunes: \u201cSkullduggery\u201d from Yahoo News\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Rep.
