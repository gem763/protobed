As a food writer, I\u2019ve certainly endorsed things like bulk-buying grains, roasting sheet pan after sheet pan of vegetables on a slow Sunday afternoon, and relying on prepared foods like rotisserie chicken when you just don\u2019t have time to cook. The (mostly white, mostly middle-class) food reformers who sell the idea that a return to home cooking will solve many of our health problems insist that healthy, budget-friendly cooking is absolutely in reach for everyone, so long as you plan, prioritize and make time.\n\nThe often overlooked reality is that it\u2019s actually not simple for many people, especially low-income parents and other caregivers. Obstacles like unpredictable shift work, unreliable appliances, lack of easy access to fresh food and the very high expectations of modern parenting can make budget cooking (and thus, any fresh home cooking) downright unreachable. For those folks, there\u2019s simply not enough time to prep inexpensive staples from scratch, and not enough money for time-saving market solutions afforded to others.\n\nAdShooter via Getty Images\n\n\u201cA lot of cooking advice, even budget cooking advice, makes assumptions about what a person\u2019s life and home looks like.\u201d\n\nIn March, sociologists Sarah Bowen, Joslyn Brenton and Sinikka Elliott published a book, \u201cPressure Cooker: Why Home Cooking Won\u2019t Solve Our Problems and What We Can Do About It,\u201d based on a five-year observational study to better understand the challenges of feeding a family. The study focused on about 120 low-income mothers from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds living in central North Carolina. The researchers spent time in the women\u2019s homes and followed them on trips to grocery stores and to social service organizations that provide food for families with low incomes.\n\n\u201cEven \u2018chop a bunch of vegetables\u2019 assumes that you have a sharp knife, a cutting board, a working oven. And a lot of the recipes assume bigger things, like having a Crock Pot or other specialized equipment.\u201d - Sarah Bowen, sociologist\n\nThe researchers chose to focus on mothers for a reason: \u201cIt\u2019s women that are mostly tasked with feeding families,\u201d Brenton told HuffPost.\n\nResearch backs this up: A 2018 study published in Nutrition Journal found that while women spend nearly an hour a day in the kitchen, men spend just 20 minutes. This is especially problematic when you take into account that in 2018, 76% of women worked outside the home in addition to being the primary homemakers. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that while the struggles outlined below in general take the greatest toll on mothers (and primary caregivers or homemakers, regardless of gender), they still apply broadly to low-income families and individuals.\n\nOverall, the study found that these mothers cared deeply about providing healthy food for their families and understood what that entailed \u2014 they just didn\u2019t have the time or resources to do it.\n\n\u201cA lot of cooking advice, even budget cooking advice, makes assumptions about what a person\u2019s life and home looks like,\u201d Bowen told HuffPost. \u201cEven \u2018chop a bunch of vegetables\u2019 assumes that you have a sharp knife, a cutting board, a working oven. And a lot of the recipes assume bigger things, like having a Crock-Pot or other specialized equipment.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of brainstorming and planning meals that will work for a given family, and then grocery shopping for those items. Bowen pointed out that many mothers in the study didn\u2019t have cars or easy access to a grocery store. They would either take the bus to the store and a taxi home with all of their grocery bags, or they would rely on another friend or family member to drive. For this reason (and to keep closer track of their budgets), many women participating in the study shopped just once a month, which meant they could purchase fewer fresh foods and more inexpensive convenience foods like boxed mac and cheese.\n\n\u201cPeople will say time and money are excuses, that home cooking is really not that hard. We want to emphasize that it is hard, and that it involves a lot of invisible labor.\u201d\n\nAnyone who feeds a family can likely attest to the fact that a lot of work goes into cooking before you turn the knob on the stove. Much of the research and advice surrounding time spent cooking doesn\u2019t really grasp the full picture, Elliott said.\n\nIn examining the challenges of home cooking and offering solutions, food reformers and researchers often \u201cdon\u2019t take into account the invisible labor: planning meals and grocery lists, thinking about less expensive substitutions, knowing what you have at home,\u201d Elliott told HuffPost.\n\nAdditionally, the shift work in retail, fast food and other service jobs that many low-income parents hold usually comes with an erratic and unpredictable schedule that often isn\u2019t finalized until the week of, which makes planning especially hard, Elliott added. Even mothers in higher income brackets struggled to find time to cook and felt guilty about it, she said, though many were able to take advantage of market solutions like meal kits or prepared foods.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason parents are spending so much time investing in their children is because they\u2019re worried about their children\u2019s future, worried about them going down the mobility ladder instead of up.\u201d - Sinikka Elliott, sociologist\n\nElliot also argued that there is emotional labor in trying to make cooking and mealtime a happy, positive experience for one\u2019s family, even during times of struggle, and that it is nearly impossible to quantify. All three co-authors pointed to an increased pressure for this generation of parents to be involved with their children\u2019s lives and prioritize quality time.\n\n\u201cSociological research shows part of the reason parents are spending so much time investing in their children is because they\u2019re worried about their children\u2019s future, worried about them going down the mobility ladder instead of up,\u201d Elliott said. This emphasis on more quality time, plus the fact that parents generally have less free time than they did in previous generations, is yet another obstacle to making time for budget-friendly, healthy cooking.\n\n\u201cHow can we make it possible for more families to feel like they have the time to enjoy dinner? One way is to give them more control over their time by raising wages and providing more predictable schedules.\u201d\n\nIn terms of actionable solutions, it\u2019s complicated.\n\n\u201cHow can we make it possible for more families to feel like they have the time to enjoy dinner? One way is to give them more control over their time by raising wages and providing more predictable schedules,\u201d Bowen said.\n\nSmaller community initiatives can also make a big impact. A library in Lee County, North Carolina, for example, allows people to loan out appliances, such as Crock-Pots, Bowen said. While that doesn\u2019t solve every problem, it\u2019s a good place to start. Other communities have begun using school and church kitchens to cook bulk meals during off-hours, then selling them on a sliding scale.", "description": "Not everyone has time to prep meals or money to buy Instant Pots.", "authors": ["On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8b96421e0000300071fbcf.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
