Many were not live, but were still in their testing phase when we suspended them,\" the company said in a Friday blog post.\n\n\"It is not unusual for developers to have multiple test apps that never get rolled out. And in many cases, the developers did not respond to our request for information so we suspended them, honoring our commitment to take action.\"\n\nFACEBOOK'S ZUCKERBERG SAYS THERE 'CLEARLY WAS BIAS' IN CONTROVERSY OVER 'CENSORSHIP' OF PRO-LIFE GROUP LIVE ACTION\n\nFACEBOOK EXPANDS RESOURCES AND TIGHTENS POLICIES TO PREVENT SUICIDE\n\nThe company also said it has taken legal action in some instances.\n\nEarlier this year, Facebook filed a lawsuit in California against Rankwave, a South Korean data analytics company that would not cooperate with the company's investigation. And it filed an action against two other companies, LionMobi and JediMobi, that used their apps to infect users\u2019 cellphones with malware in a sort of profit-generating scheme.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., told The Washington Post: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t some accident. Facebook put up a neon sign that said, \u2018Free Private Data,\u2019 and let app developers have their fill of Americans\u2019 personal info. The FTC needs to hold Mark Zuckerberg personally responsible.\u201d\n\n\"And now, barely 24 hrs after insisting to my face that Facebook takes personal privacy more seriously than anything else, FB reveals potentially massive data breaches,\" said Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican, on Twitter.\n\nFacebook is facing pressure on several fronts.\n\nFACEBOOK TO BATTLE EXTREMISM BY TRAINING AI WITH POLICE VIDEOS\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe social network's new Federal Trade Commission (FTC) agreement requires developers to annually certify compliance with the company's policies or face consequences.\n\nDuring CEO Mark Zuckerberg's round of Capitol Hill meetings over the last two days, he's been asked whether he intends to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp over antitrust concerns (he does not), and he's admitted that the company's handling of a recent controversy about abortion reflected bias.\n\nThe ubiquitous social platform is also facing an antitrust probe led by state attorneys general -- in addition to a separate FTC inquiry.", "description": "Facebook has suspended tens of thousands of apps that have in some way mishandled user data as the company faces a range of U.S. investigations and potential regulatory actions.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/zuckerberg-getty-images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
