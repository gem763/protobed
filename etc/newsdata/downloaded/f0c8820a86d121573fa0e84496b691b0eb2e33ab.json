(AP) - Ricardo Allen hopes to return to pro football after spending last Sunday back in the Big Ten.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what it felt like to Allen, a fifth-year free safety whose Atlanta Falcons gave up 172 yards rushing on 38 carries in the opener.\n\nThat\u2019s way too many running plays to face in an NFL game. Allen knows it can\u2019t happen again.\n\n\u201cIt took me back to my college times,\u201d Allen, a former Purdue standout, said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those games, if you don\u2019t stop the run, one of the easiest plays in football is to just hand it off. If you can do that, you can control the clock. You can control the ball. You\u2019ve got better chances just handing the ball off and going.\u201d\n\nAllen can only hope the Falcons (0-1) don\u2019t dig another early hole Sunday night against Philadelphia (1-0). Atlanta trailed 21-0 midway through the second quarter at Minnesota, and the Vikings used the early advantage to play old-school offense.\n\nIt was an embarrassment for a defense that last year ranked second worst in third-down percentage, third worst in yards per carry, fifth worst in yards per game, and eighth worst in scoring.\n\nWith Allen, Keanu Neal and Deion Jones back at full strength after all three sustained major injuries in last year\u2019s 7-9 season, the Falcons had hoped for a quick turnaround, particularly after coach Dan Quinn made himself defensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do what we needed to do,\u201d nose tackle Grady Jarrett said. \u201cThey executed well and kept getting outside. We need to address that if we want to have a good defense. We want to get better because teams will put that on film and attack that against us.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s challenge will likely be tougher. The Eagles have a dangerous run-pass option in quarterback Carson Wentz, whose offense piled up 436 yards in rallying Philadelphia from a 17-0 deficit to beat Washington.\n\nReceiver DeSean Jackson, tight end Zach Ertz, receiver Alshon Jeffrey and running backs Darren Sproles, Miles Sanders and Jordan Harris give Wentz abundant options, but the Falcons\u2019 first concern is to try and contain the trio of running backs.\n\nThey can\u2019t afford another letdown on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe understand what we have to do,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat was one of the first times I\u2019ve seen a team being able to come out and do that to us. We know what we\u2019ve got to do. We\u2019ve got to fight.\u201d\n\nQuinn, as he\u2019s done since he arrived in January 2015, keeps harping on takeaways, but there\u2019s been no evidence over the last two years that his message is getting through. The Falcons forced just eight fumbles last season and ranked second worst with four fumble recoveries. They were ninth in interceptions, but seven of the picks went to Damontae Kazee, who has moved to nickel cornerback after filling in for Allen last year.\n\nAtlanta was minus-3 in turnover margin last week.\n\n\u201cIt was hard on us to have a performance like that when we have really high expectations for one another,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cBut like I said, as the teacher in me, if there\u2019s a way for us to have this lesson, I\u2019d rather get hit right now, to get this lesson learned and applied, not seven or 10 weeks later.\n\n\u201cThat lesson about the ball, it\u2019s real. We didn\u2019t get any to put ourselves into the plus.\u201d\n\nNotes: Quinn said rookie RG Chris Lindstrom underwent successful surgery on his broken left foot. Lindstrom, the 14th overall draft pick, isn\u2019t expected to return until November. \u2026 Return specialist Kenjon Barner (ankle) was added to the injury report. He joined OT Matt Gono (back), G Wes Schweitzer (shoulder) WR Russell Gage (concussion) in being limited at practice. \u2026 DT Deadrin Senat (back) was a full participant.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ricardo Allen hopes to return to pro football after spending last Sunday back in the Big Ten.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/falcons_vikings_football_99476_c0-155-3692-2307_s1770x1032.jpg?9fad77e783b057fd979e562cec7c6769b3522b06", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
