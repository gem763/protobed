Maybe he is even talking to Biden\u2019s staff,\u201d the former official said. \u201cMaybe it is innocent, maybe not.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Crilly Etal", "Washingtonexaminer.Com News Joe-Biden-Worked-With-Whistleblower-When-He-Was-Vice-President-Officials-Reveal"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
