And yet, the filmmakers behind Frozen and the upcoming Frozen II say making a sequel wasn\u2019t their first instinct and the road to get there was more than a little bumpy.\n\n\u201cWe hadn\u2019t been talking about [a sequel] at all,\u201d Frozen II writer and co-director Jennifer Lee told Gizmodo at a recent press day. \u201c[But] by the time we started talking about it all we had to say was \u2018We actually have an idea for Frozen...\u2019 [and they interrupted us] \u2018What do you need? Go ahead. Spend some time in the story room. Take a month. Just enjoy yourselves.\u2019 So we had no plans at all.\u201d\n\nSix years after the release of the first Frozen, the film has become a part of our cultural DNA. The characters, the songs, many of us know them as well as we know ourselves. Because of that, it\u2019s easy to forget that when the movie came out in 2013, it wasn\u2019t instantly a hit. It didn\u2019t even win the box office in either of its first two weekends (one limited, one wide).\n\nBut word got around, the buzz grew, \u201cLet It Go\u201d played everywhere, and the film stayed in the top 10 for 18 consecutive weeks of an unheard-of, 35-week theatrical run.\n\nIt ultimately became the highest-grossing animated film worldwide... that is, until Disney\u2019s own remake of The Lion King took the spot this past year.\n\nProducer Peter Del Vecho, writer and co-director Jennifer Lee, and co-director Chris Buck earlier this month at a Frozen II press day at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Burbank, CA, (Photo: Disney Animation)\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, with that kind of success, Disney probably would have made a Frozen sequel no matter who was involved. Thankfully, before that could happen, Lee and her co-director Chris Buck\u2019s faint first ideas were enough. Those ideas came from Buck and Lee continuing to think about the characters long after the movie was released and was successful.\n\n\u201cIt was really just pressure on ourselves,\u201d Buck told Gizmodo about building up to making the sequel. \u201cIt was more about [us] falling in love with the characters when we did the short and then realising there\u2019s so much more story to tell. These characters are just starting their lives.\u201d\n\nThe first Frozen ended with Elsa, the woman with magical ice powers, becoming the queen of Arendelle after her love saved her sister, Anna, from being an icicle. And while that\u2019s an ending, the filmmakers realised it was also a beginning.\n\n\u201cNow that Elsa is back, she\u2019s the queen of Arendelle, but what does that mean?\u201d Buck continued. \u201cShe\u2019s always been hiding, or in fear of, that. Now people have accepted her. Great. So what\u2019s next. We went from there\u201d\n\nAnna with Olaf, who doesn\u2019t need that cloud anymore because Elsa gave him a permafrost. Olaf also has a new song in Frozen II about misunderstanding things with age. (Image: Disney Animation)\n\nWhile making the first film, Lee, who is now also the Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios, said she never could have anticipated how big of an impact Anna and Elsa would have on people. Those reactions also became part of the formula that inspired the sequel.\n\n\u201cWe kept hearing people related to [Elsa] a lot and for all different reasons,\u201d Lee said. \u201cSome of that is she would carry a lot of people who feel high expectations or felt different... Then it would always be followed up with, \u2018Why does she have powers?\u2019 I\u2019d never thought past her being different and that, in the end, she could be accepted for who she was. But she\u2019s never been able to live with herself, accept herself. What is her destiny? What is she meant to do? And all of those things were spinning.\u201d\n\nAnd so, in early 2015, the then jumbled collection of broad ideas known as Frozen II, was officially in the works. Things really began to come into focus, though, when the research began. On the first film, Lee and Buck were so crunched for time (a year of their production schedule was trimmed off at one point and Lee was only on the film for the final 18 months) they never got to go to the countries that inspired their story: Norway, Finland, and Iceland. That became a priority for the sequel and the trip happened in 2016. However, they never could have guessed just how important the trip would be.\n\nThis isn\u2019t from the finished film. It\u2019s a piece of concept art that informed how the forest would look in the film. (Image: Disney Animation)\n\n\u201cIt was shocking for me when I look back on my notes,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI have literal documentation of the moments we have breakthroughs in the story. We [came] back with the main arc of our story and we [stayed] with it.\u201d\n\nFrozen II begins with a flashback of Anna and Elsa as young girls as we finally get to spend time with their parents (their mother is voiced by Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood).\n\nThe story then shifts three years after the end of the first film when everything seems to be going fine for the sisters, Kristoff, Sven and Olaf. That is until Elsa begins to hear a voice in her head. Something calling her \u201cInto the Unknown,\u201d as an early song is titled.\n\nTurns out that voice ties into the trip Anna and Elsa\u2019s parents were on when they perished in the first film. Eventually, it also takes them deep into an enchanted forest, far away from Arendelle, where questions about Elsa\u2019s destiny will be answered.\n\nWhere the first Frozen was all cold, like winter, Frozen II is warmer, like autumn. Mythology plays an even bigger role this time around, especially with new creatures like a water horse called the Nokk and a wind character named Gale. Those ideas of a forest setting, of it taking place in the autumn, of bringing in even more mythology, all of that came from the filmmakers spending several weeks immersing themselves in Norway, Finland and Iceland.\n\n\u201cThere were just stunning moments of standing behind a waterfall, inside the volcano. There was one on a glacier and in the forest when I fell under the rocks, being with wild reindeer. Each time there were moments that you see that are in the film because they created such an emotional experience,\u201d Lee said.\n\nConcept art of the wind spirit, Gale, who is literally just wind. It can mimic things, such as Olaf. (Image: Disney Animation)\n\nStepping back even further, Buck added that the general environments of the countries spoke to the differences between the sisters. \u201cIt was kind of a stark contrast between Norway and Iceland that framed the concept for us,\u201d he said. Anna felt at home in Norway with its fairytale settings, but Elsa felt strangely at home in this dark, mythic Iceland.\u201d\n\nThat juxtaposition of dark, mythic stories, personified by Elsa, versus the simpler, fairytale life, personified by Anna, also became a through-line in the film, though the filmmakers were quiet on specifics of how it plays out. It will likely, however, have to do with exploring some of those unanswered questions from the first film.\n\nElsa and the Nokk, another new character in Frozen II. (Image: Disney Animation)\n\n\u201cThere were some questions people had that we wanted to answer,\u201d Lee said. \u201cFor me, particularly, in terms of understanding the parents a little more and what motivated the girls emotionally as children. I love to ask those questions and [had] them myself.\u201d\n\nFinding the answers to those questions meant the filmmakers began to look at Frozen and Frozen II as two parts of a single story. A second chapter needed to be told to complete the first. It seems like, if they hadn\u2019t come to that realisation, Frozen II may not have ever happened. At least not with Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck at the helm.\n\n\u201cIt was a breakthrough,\u201d producer Peter Del Vecho told Gizmodo. \u201cThat idea of Frozen II to Frozen one making it one journey. Seeing parts of Frozen one from a different vantage point...\u201d and, just like the song from the first movie said, Buck stepped in to finish his producer\u2019s sentence sandwich.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting to us as filmmakers,\u201d he said, of melding the movies.\n\nFrozen II opens November 28 and we\u2019ll have much more on the film in the coming weeks.", "description": "The idea of making a sequel to one of the biggest animated films of all time somehow seems more than just \u201cobvious.\u201d \u201cEssential\u201d is likely a better word.
