But it could also be the first step toward creating a new weapon for monetary authorities rapidly running out of traditional firepower.\n\nThe ECB said last week that it would both pay a higher rate of interest on deposits and charge a lower fee for lending, both under strict conditions. On the deposit side, the introduction of what the ECB calls \u201ctiering\u201d allows banks to avoid the penalty rate of minus 0.5% on deposits of excess reserves\u2014high-powered central bank money\u2014of up to six times the reserves they are required to hold by regulators. Given that the region\u2019s banks hold \u20ac1.8 trillion ($1.99 trillion) of excess reserves and the figure will keep rising now the ECB has resumed buying bonds, this is a big deal for banks. Frederik Ducrozet, global macro strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, estimates the tiering alone will save the banks \u20ac3.1 billion a year.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should central banks reward banks that lend to the real economy with access to cheap money? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nAt the same time, the ECB is restarting special long-term loans to banks, designed to encourage lending to businesses and consumers. If a bank meets the conditions for increased lending to the real economy\u2014excluding mortgages\u2014the interest rate on the loan from the ECB can be as low as minus 0.5%.\n\nPut these together, and a bank might be able to borrow from the ECB at less than it deposits with the ECB, if it keeps its excess reserves down and its lending up.\n\nAt one level, this is bonkers. Back in 2008, I was one of a small group of lucky borrowers with a mortgage tied to central bank interest rates; after rates were slashed I was able to earn more on deposits than I paid on my mortgage with the very same bank. But this reversal of financial reality was a sign of poor planning by my bank combined with the most serious crisis in generations. The ECB is doing the same at a time when banks are functioning fine, unemployment is back to the lows of 2007, and inflation, while below its target, is still positive.\n\nAt another level it might be a sign of Mario Draghi \u2019s genius. The ECB president warned last week that he was out of ammo. His press conference on Thursday could be summed up as handing over responsibility for boosting inflation to governments, calling on them to spend more, while telling the banks it was their own fault that they were so unprofitable and there was no need for the ECB to help.\n\nYet, underneath the rhetoric\u2014reasonable in both cases\u2014the ECB has put in place something that could be expanded indefinitely in future, and directly affects both banks and the real economy.\n\n\u201cYou could push this to a 10-year permanent facility at minus 1%, to take a very extreme example,\u201d said Mr. Ducrozet. \u201cIt would be helicopter money \u00e0 la ECB.\u201d\n\nThe brilliance of the arrangement as currently designed is that banks can only benefit from it if they increase their lending to the real economy, not if they lend to property or financial speculators. That should draw the political sting of what is, looked at dispassionately, free money for banks.\n\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi at a news conference in Frankfurt, Germany, Sept. 12.

Cut the rate on long-term loans to banks further, and the conditions on the lending mean it is likely to quickly be passed through to the economy. The political downside is that unlike simple rate cuts, bank profits are partially shielded by the tiering scheme. The political upside is that it doesn\u2019t directly make the rich richer by boosting asset prices the way buying bonds has in the eurozone.\n\nThere are side effects, chief among them that the ECB or eurozone national central banks might make a loss. Last year the ECB made a \u20ac1.6 billion profit, paid out to central banks in eurozone countries and potentially supporting their countries\u2019 budgets. Central banks can ignore losses, and run with negative equity on their balance sheets, and many have in the past. But the ECB has been disapproving of such an approach, warning that negative equity \u201cmay affect the credibility of the Eurosystem\u2019s monetary policy.\u201d Losing money isn\u2019t a good look for the guardian of the printing press.\n\nThe ECB doesn\u2019t want to have to do more, and would much prefer that governments step up spending and tax cuts. But it showed last week that\u2014despite Mr. Draghi\u2019s warnings\u2014it still has the capability to act in the future, if it can muster the will.\n\nWrite to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.com", "description": "If you think negative interest rates are weird, brace yourself: The European Central Bank is about to start lending to some banks at less than it pays them for putting money on deposit.", "authors": ["James Mackintosh", "James.Mackintosh Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107727/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
