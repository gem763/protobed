However, innuendo in the Sunday Times article in reference to me, [Anti-Gang Unit head Andre Lincoln] and Lieutenant General Peter Jacobs as part of 'a clique of coloured stalwarts', who were 'controversial figures for several years', is indicative of a much more divisive racist agenda peddled by the Sunday Times in their article.\"\n\nMohamed did not respond to questions, the report said. Modack also did not give the publication permission to publish any recording with his voice.\n\nAccording to the article citing an affidavit, Modack lodged a complaint with the police in April. He and his bodyguards had driven to the scene where the bodyguard of alleged gang boss Colin Booysen was murdered in Belhar in September last year.\n\nThere, Modack and his men were reportedly arrested and briefly held at Ravensmead police station. Upon their release, their confiscated guns had not been returned.\n\nThis is ostensibly what led to the recorded conversation, according to the report.\n\nNational Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila confirmed to News24 that the docket had been sent to SAPS' Anti-Corruption Unit by the director for public prosecutions in the Western Cape for further investigation.\n\nVearey, a favourite to take over as Western Cape police commissioner after the transfer of Khombinkosi Jula to KwaZulu-Natal, had lodged an official complaint with police commissioner Kehla Sitole after he failed to make the shortlist for the province's top job.\n\nAccording to his letter, this was supposedly because he had allegedly not included proof of his qualifications.\n\nBut the Sunday Times quoted a source close to the selection process as saying that Vearey had not made the shortlist as he did not meet the minimum requirements.\n\nPolice did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n*This story has been updated pending more comment.", "description": "One of the Western Cape\u2019s top cops has denied he was the voice in a recording allegedly soliciting a bribe from Cape Town underworld figure Nafiz Modack.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7448/5887580608de4c4b94bdb5b40ef1c1f8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
