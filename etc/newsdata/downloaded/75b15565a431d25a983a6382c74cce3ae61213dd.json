This would suggest the Turks have provided their Syrian proxy fighters with equipment.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Syrian allies, largely drawn from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) group that was once touted as a \u201cmoderate\u201d rebel faction by the Obama administration, are accused of repeatedly violating the cease-fire agreement:\n\nSDF officials in the area have told Rudaw that Turkish-backed groups do not honor or respect international laws or agreements, a claim also made by relief organization the Free Burma Rangers. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is the Free Syrian Army is [conducting] a ground attack. There never was a ceasefire. Everyday they\u2019ve been fighting, and the Turkish military [attack] with airstrikes and drones. Two days ago tanks and armored cars attacked people, chasing the civilians out,\u201d David Eubank, head of Free Burma Rangers told Rudaw in Tel Tamr on Monday. \u201cWe have been moving patients and casualties from the front line everyday. We ourselves were attacked and almost killed,\u201d Eubank added.\n\nThe SDF said it has withdrawn from the Syria-Turkey border in accordance with the Turkey-Russia agreement, but accused the FSA of unilaterally deciding to add more areas to the \u201csafe zone\u201d and launching surprise attacks against SDF forces in those areas.\n\nSome SDF members accused Turkey of supporting these attacks with artillery fire and expressed disappointment with the Syrian army for responding slowly to the cease-fire violations, even though Syrian soldiers and civilians have been injured in the attacks. Syrian military units are supposed to be moving into the safe zone and taking up positions formerly held by Kurdish militia.\n\nThe head of the SDF media office in northern Syria, Mustafa Bali, described Turkey\u2019s proxy fighters as \u201cjihadists\u201d and said Turkey has \u201cno intention to stop fighting despite the announced agreement.\u201d He said the Turkish assaults included drones and other \u201cheavy weapons.\u201d\n\nBali also posted a video of Free Syrian Army fighters surrounding an injured female SDF fighter and shouting curses at her.\n\nNew footage showing a TSFA fighters' gathering shouting and cursing at female SDF fighter \"Chichak Kobani\", while she seems to be injured and shouts of pain pic.twitter.com/NvmHzZTjM8 \u2014 Mustafa Bali (@mustefabali) October 28, 2019\n\nThe ceasefire technically expires at 6:00 p.m. local time on Tuesday, at which time Russian and Turkish forces are scheduled to begin jointly patrolling the Syrian side of the Turkish border. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Tuesday that Kurdish forces have not fully withdrawn from the safe area as agreed.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the YPG terror organization is still in the area of Operation Peace Spring. This fight is not over. We are aware that it will not end,\u201d said Akar. The YPG is the main Kurdish militia group in Syria. Operation Peace Spring is the name given to Turkey for its latest incursion into Syria.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, on the other hand, said on Tuesday that Kurdish withdrawal from the \u201csafety corridor\u201d has been \u201ccompleted ahead of schedule,\u201d as confirmed by both Syrian border guards and Russian military police.\n\nRussia and Turkey are currently holding discussions to work out the logistics of joint border patrols. According to a spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the patrols will \u201cestablish whether or not the terrorists have actually withdrawn,\u201d by which he meant YPG forces.", "description": "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Monday that clashes with Turkish-backed militia groups in Syria continue.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178651352-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
