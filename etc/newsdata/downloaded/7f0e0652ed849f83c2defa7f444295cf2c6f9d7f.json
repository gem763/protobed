But in Poland, where the nation is engaged in a bitter and consequential battle over the question of what it means to be Polish, the prize has led to controversy, instead.\n\nWhen Olga Tokarczuk of Poland won it on Thursday, the reaction was as divided as is the country itself. To some, she is an eloquent writer who captures Poland\u2019s tragic and inspiring 20th-century history. To others, she is a traitor.\n\nMs. Tokarczuk has documented Poland\u2019s long history of pluralism and ethnic mixing at the same time as her government has cast migrants as a mortal danger to the nation. She has denounced attacks on gays and globalists, even as leaders in Poland\u2019s governing Law and Justice Party have sought to convince voters that a \u201crainbow plague\u201d backed by decadent Western leaders presented an existential threat to both families and the nation itself.\n\nSo with national elections scheduled to take place in Poland on Sunday, perhaps it was not surprising that Poland\u2019s competing factions sought to use the prize announcement to bolster their own sides.", "description": "When Olga Tokarczuk of Poland won the prize, the reaction was as divided as is the country itself.
