The Clinton impeachment fight gave us a President\u2019s memorable hairsplitting over what the meaning of \u201cis\u201d is. The Trump impeachment fight is already giving us its own disputes over the very nature of language and power, intent and action. With Trump, impeachment will end up being about more fundamental questions of executive authority in a democracy: Was there a quid pro quo or not in the call? What is extortion? Abuse of power?\n\nWe can now look forward to endless, circular, partisan, and highly unsatisfying debates on those questions, in the coming weeks and months. There will be much more shouting. There will be more facts to emerge, subsidiary plotlines to follow, spinoff scandals, new characters. The whistle-blower\u2019s complaint has already made its way to Capitol Hill, where leaders and members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have been reading it\u2014and giving all the signs that it contains alarming new revelations. Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell said it was a \u201cfive-alarm concern for me.\u201d Even a Republican senator, Ben Sasse, of Nebraska, suggested that the information contained in the complaint was significant and \u201cvery troubling.\u201d Clearly, there will be more revelations, and soon. But we have already learned a lot this week. This is the forty-eight hours that finally answered one of the enduring mysteries of the Trump Presidency: yes, we can now say, a Democratic House of Representatives will move forward with impeaching this most unusual of Presidents. We don\u2019t know who it will benefit politically, or where the investigation will end up. We don\u2019t know which scandals will make the final cut in the articles of impeachment and which will be left out. But it is happening. The next season of the Trump show has begun.", "description": "", "authors": ["Susan Glasser", "Newyorker.Com News Letter-From-Trumps-Washington Do-Us-A-Favor-The-Forty-Eight-Hours-That-Sealed-Trumps-Impeachment"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
