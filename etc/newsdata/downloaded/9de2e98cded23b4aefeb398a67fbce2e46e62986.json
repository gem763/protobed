There is so much on the line. Egos, subscribers, the crown of \u201cThe YouTube King\u201d,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018The last match was a draw. If the W is secured in a monumental way, something similar to when Conor McGregor knocked out Jose Aldo, if something like that happens, it is going to be long-lasting form of stardom.\u2019\n\nLogan and KSI will be taking to the ring in November (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe YouTube star added that boxing helps to get rid of the \u2018stigma\u2019 of being a YouTuber.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, after the pair fought last year, with the match ending in a draw, he thinks he\u2019s spotted one of KSI\u2019s weaknesses.\n\n\u2018I think the head gear saved him last time,\u2019 he said at his workout showcase in LA. \u2018I like throwing hooks and with the headgear, you can\u2019t get to that button.\u2019\n\nLogan\u2019s best friend Mike Majlak previously told Metro.co.uk about the YouTuber\u2019s grueling training regime, explaining: \u2018There are no distractions, there are no girls at the house\u2026He\u2019s in bed by 10, no questions asked.\u2019\n\nThe last fight ended in a draw (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nThe co-host of the Impaulsive podcast added that his trainer Shannon Briggs wanted him going to extremes.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s [eating] 8000 calories of meat, and Shannon wants him literally eating the brains of animals,\u2019 Mike revealed. \u2018There\u2019s stuff we won\u2019t do that Shannon wants us to do. This guy is a monster.\u2019\n\nHowever, KSI\u2019s definitely not slacking, after he filmed himself training with heavy-weight champ Anthony Joshua, before his trainer Viddal Riley showed him dunking himself in a freezing ice bath.\n\nDefinitely rather them than us.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
