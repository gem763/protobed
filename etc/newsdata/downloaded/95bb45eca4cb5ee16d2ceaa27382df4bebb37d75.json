(NYSE:TSLA) into competition only for the would-be rivals to falter in their pursuit.\n\nPlus, the company\u2019s Chairman Robyn Denholm, who succeeded its founder and CEO Elon Musk in that role last December after serving as an independent director on the company\u2019s board since 2014, provided an update on Oct. 25 at the annual Baron Investment Conference in New York before thousands of the mutual fund firm\u2019s clients. Ron Baron, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at Baron Funds, is an avowed fan of Tesla and its visionary leader Elon Musk.\n\nKey points offered by Denholm included Tesla rapidly developing new vehicles, becoming an unquestioned world leader in battery production and cutting the price of a battery from more than $100,000 per car 10-15 years ago to less than $10,000 now. Those new vehicles included a Tesla Semi tractor-trailer for long-haul transportation, a pickup truck and a second-generation Roadster, which the company expects to start selling next year as the \u201cquickest\u201d car in the world with record-setting acceleration, range and performance.\n\nIs Tesla One of the Electric Car Stocks to Buy?\n\nTesla turned in its second consecutive profitable third quarter to show staying power, while its rival start-up electric car companies hit the proverbial skids. In its recently closed third quarter, Tesla\u2019s earnings per share of $1.86 fell from $2.90 in the prior year but finished well above the 46-cent loss predicted by a consensus of Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe company\u2019s third-quarter revenue of $6.3 billion almost matched analysts\u2019 $6.4 billion estimate. The company\u2019s shares jumped 9.49 percent on Oct 24 and 17.67 percent on Oct. 25 after posting a surprising profit after the closing bell on Oct. 23, when Tesla also announced it was well ahead of schedule in readying its new factory in Shanghai, China.\n\nTesla\u2019s share price soared to reach its high mark in 2019 before dipping after analysts noticed that part of the company\u2019s improved results stemmed from warranty adjustments. In fact, Tesla booked almost $50 million in its latest third quarter due to a change in how it accounts for warranty costs. Overall, Tesla\u2019s shares show scant growth overall since the start of the year.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockcharts.com\n\nTesla Seeks to Become One of the Electric Car Stocks to Buy\n\nBob Carlson, who heads the Retirement Watch advisory service, cautioned that Tesla has a history of reporting a quarter of positive surprises only to be unable to sustain the progress. That tendency is likely to be the case again, he added.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe third-quarter earnings report had an opaque nonrecurring items line that went unexplained,\u201d Carlson said. It remains to be seen how much one-time events fully helped the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings, he continued.\n\n\n\nInvestors should focus on 12-month results, Carlson said. Tesla\u2019s sales are down 8 percent during the past 12 months for the first time in seven years, he added.\n\nFurther, Tesla\u2019s operating profit dropped 37 percent from a year ago, Carlson said. The company\u2019s gross profit margin is down 3 percent from 12 months ago.\n\n\u201cNone of those fundamentals make Tesla look like the hyper-growth technology company that management touts,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nConsider Risks When Eyeing Electric Car Stocks to Buy\n\nHilary Kramer, whose 2-Day Trader service has notched 18 out of 21 profitable trades with an average return of 11.99 percent and a hold time of less than a day since its launch, advised that there are reasons to remain cautious about Tesla. Reduced selling and administrative expenses also aided the company\u2019s return to profitability, but such an occurrence will not be ongoing for a growth company, she added.\n\nWith operating income of $261 million barely covering interest expense of $185 million in the third quarter, Tesla exhibits \u201cfinancial stress,\u201d Kramer said. Tesla picked up some \u201clow hanging fruit,\u201d but it still has far to go to be on a solid track to consistent profitability.\n\n\u201cElectric car stocks are in trouble because Elon Musk has already triggered what amounts to a global lithium arms race,\u201d said Kramer, who leads the GameChangers advisory service, which has booked 21 profitable trades among its last 25 transactions. \u201cGigafactories are going up all over the world, removing what was once the capacity constraint that was supposedly keeping millions of battery vehicles off the road. For consumers, it could easily become a utopian situation.\u201d\n\nBattery Market Could Affect Electric Car Stocks to Buy\n\nFor manufacturers such as Tesla that have invested billions of dollars to make the batteries, profitability may be elusive, Kramer said.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re the market leader in a deteriorating market, you have the most to lose,\u201d said Kramer, who leads the Turbo Trader, High Octane Trader and Inner Circle advisory services. \u201cYou just won\u2019t be the first to feel the pain.\u201d\n\nIf Musk drowns all his competitors in lithium batteries and wrecks his own profit margins to maintain his share of the battery market, it would be \u201ctime to buy Tesla,\u201d Kramer said. Until then, investors may be wise to avoid the shares unless buying them for the long term, she added.\n\n\u2018A lot can go wrong in the meantime,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cDemand for the Model 3 doesn\u2019t seem to be expanding at anything like the exponential rate we were promised. Overall, revenue isn\u2019t expanding at all as subsidies expire. While Tesla might well be the last Western electric car maker standing, the stock may well be broken.\u201d\n\nGeneral Motors May Be Among Electric Car Stocks to Buy\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM), which finalized a four-year contract on Oct. 25 with employees represented by the United Auto Workers at 55 of the company\u2019s work sites to end a strike, has achieved $2.4 billion in transformation cost savings since 2018 and is on track to reach its 2019 target. The company\u2019s decision to invest in its Detroit-Hamtramck plant to build an all-electric pickup truck was not part of the original transformation plan and led GM to adjust its year-end 2020 cost savings target to $4.0-$4.5 billion.\n\nInvestors responded to GM\u2019s results by boosting the price of its shares the day after the company also announced its third-quarter earnings. GM also significantly improved its cash position by the end of the third quarter, reporting adjusted automotive free cash flow of $3.8 billion, up from the same quarter last year mainly due to the timing of working capital flows, reduced capital expenditures and its joint ventures to build cars in China. The auto manufacturer\u2019s liquidity totaled $37.2 billion, jumping $3.4 billion from year-end 2018 and $3.2 billion compared to second-quarter 2019.\n\nGM also showed its capabilities as an established automaker by readying its mass-market Chevrolet Bolt for sale and partnering with Honda to develop a self-driving electric vehicle. The Detroit-based company caught major flak from President Trump when it announced plans last December to cut 14,000 jobs. Investors seem to be liking its direction, based on its rising share price.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockcharts.com\n\nPorsche, Ford and Others Advance Their Electric Vehicles\n\nPorsche is making inroads by introducing its luxury Taycan electric car, which is designed to offer high-performance capabilities. Ford (NYSE:F) is teaming up with Volkswagen to use the latter company\u2019s platform to offer electric vehicles in Europe.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockcharts.com\n\nBankruptcies Complicate Which Electric Car Stocks to Buy\n\nJia Yueting, an entrepreneur who amassed billions of dollars in debt to build a business empire in China, filed for bankruptcy in the United States and agreed to turn over his electric vehicle startup venture to creditors. In a proposed debt-restructuring plan filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, Jia opted to use his ownership stake in Los Angeles-based Faraday Future Inc. to set up a creditor trust to repay his debts.\n\nFaraday Future, a global shared intelligent mobility company, announced its latest equity financing in the form of a planned initial public offering (IPO) within the next 12-15 months. The company announced its projected funding needs for its next stage have been significantly reduced to $850 million from an original estimate of $2 billion.\n\nSince the start of the decade, a partial list of electronic vehicle failures includes Bright Automotive, AMP, Aptera, Coda, Detroit Electric, Fisker Automotive and LeEco. Some of the companies were woefully underfunded, while others produced or raised plenty of cash. In fact, Fisker raised more than $2 billion in cash.\n\nVacuum maker Dyson halted its electric vehicle program, after its founder James Dyson advised he could \u201cno longer\u201d see a way to attain commercial viability.\n\nFederal Subsidy Raises Questions about Electric Car Stocks to Buy\n\nA critic of the federal government subsidy of electric car sales is Dr. Mark Skousen, who heads the Forecasts & Strategies advisory service. He asked Tesla\u2019s Chairman Denholm to respond to \u201ccriticisms of Tesla\u201d that taxpayers pay billions of dollars to help wealthy Americans buy expensive sports cars.\n\n\u201cNow that Tesla is profitable, would you favor discontinuing this tax break for the wealthy?\u201d Skousen asked to scattered applause from some of the attendees at the Baron Investment Conference.\n\nDenholm responded that Tesla doesn\u2019t receive the subsidy, only car buyers do. Plus, she noted that every nation offers a variety of subsidies or tax credits, but she stopped short of answering the query directly.\n\nRon Baron commented that the $7,500 tax credit per vehicle will be phased out in December.\n\nInvestors must weigh economic uncertainty, international disputes, Europe\u2019s negative interest rates, rising U.S. government debt, China\u2019s refusal to halt its unfair trade practices and U.S. House Democrats seeking to impeach President Trump without Republican input. Electric vehicle stocks to buy appear limited and even Tesla still must prove it has the financing and operational capabilities to stave off established automakers such as GM and Ford that are drafting off early gains achieved by Musk and his colleagues.\n\nPaul Dykewicz, www.pauldykewicz.com, is an accomplished, award-winning journalist who has written for Dow Jones, the Wall Street Journal, Investor\u2019s Business Daily, USA Today, the Journal of Commerce, Seeking Alpha, GuruFocus and other publications and websites.
