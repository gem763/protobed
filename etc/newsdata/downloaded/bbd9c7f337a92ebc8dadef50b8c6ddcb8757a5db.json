(AP) - A painting seized by the Nazis from a Jewish family in 1933 has been recovered from a museum in upstate New York by the FBI.\n\nThe work, \u201cWinter\u201d by American artist Gari Melchers, was part of the collection at the Arkell Museum in Canajoharie until Sept. 10, according to federal court documents. The recovery is part of an international effort to find artwork that was stolen after the Nazis\u2019 ascension to power.\n\nGerman publisher and philanthropist Rudolf Mosse first acquired the painting from the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in 1900. The Nazi government seized control of the family\u2019s art collection after Mosse\u2019s family members fled Germany in 1933. The Nazis had persecuted the family because they were Jewish and because of their affiliations with Berliner Tageblatt, a newspaper critical of the party, according to court documents.\n\nBartlett Arkell, the first president of the Beech-Nut Packing Company, brought the painting from a New York City gallery in 1934 for his personal collection and it later became part of the collection at the museum 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Albany that bears his name.\n\nSuzan D. Friedlander, the museum\u2019s executive director and chief curator, said in an emailed statement that the museum \u201cwas of course very upset to learn the history of the painting\u2019s seizure from the Mosse family by the Nazis in 1933.\u201d The museum waived all rights to the painting, which is also known as \u201cSkaters\u201d or \u201cSnow.\u201d\n\nThe painting will remain at the FBI\u2019s Albany office until it is reunited with the Mosse family.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A painting seized by the Nazis from a Jewish family in 1933 has been recovered from a museum in upstate New York by the FBI.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
