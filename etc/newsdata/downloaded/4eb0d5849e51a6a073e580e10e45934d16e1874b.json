Now, Democrats are firing back directly at the platforms and their rules, rather than simply running counter ads.\n\nThe controversy came to a breaking point on Saturday when Elizabeth Warren challenged Facebook\u2019s political advertising policies, exposing the platform\u2019s unwillingness to remove false or misleading ads from politicians. Warren\u2019s ad falsely said that Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed President Donald Trump for reelection in 2020. The ad includes an image of Zuckerberg shaking Trump\u2019s hand in what appears to be the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cWe intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook\u2019s ad platform to see if it\u2019d be approved,\u201d Warren tweeted. She said that the ad was quickly approved and allowed to run. Warren continued, \u201cFacebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They\u2019ve decided to let political figures lie to you.\u201d\n\nWe intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook\u2019s ad platform to see if it\u2019d be approved. It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook.

That could favor conspiratorial populists like Trump, whose rhetoric often veers into the realm of conspiracy and disinformation. And since platforms like Facebook can be every bit as important as TV buys, Democrats are starting to realize it\u2019s time to take on Facebook\u2019s policies directly.\n\nWarren has been butting heads with Facebook for some time. Shortly after she put out her big policy plan to break up big tech companies like Facebook and Google, she ran an ad on Facebook showcasing the position. Facebook took down that ad, initially saying that it violated the platform\u2019s advertising policies. After criticism mounted over the move, Facebook reinstated the ad.\n\nIn response to Warren\u2019s ad, Facebook tweeted from its PR Twitter account, saying \u201cLooks like broadcast stations across the country have aired this ad nearly 1,000 times, as required by law. FCC doesn\u2019t want broadcast companies censoring candidates\u2019 speech. We agree it\u2019s better to let voters\u2014not companies\u2014decide.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s Saturday ad play was the climax after a week of attacks from the Democratic National Committee and Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign dunking on social media platforms. The Biden campaign penned letters to Facebook and Twitter requesting that they remove an ad placed by Trump\u2019s reelection campaign making baseless claims that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was facing a corruption probe in Ukraine when the former vice president was intervening to fire a prosecutor there.\n\nNone of the ads placed on Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube have been removed as of publication, and the three platforms have all said that they do not violate their advertising policies.\n\nFacebook was the most transparent about their policies, with their public policy director for global elections Katie Harbath writing, \u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus, when a politician speaks or makes an ad, we do not send it to third party fact checkers,\u201d she continued. (Harbath served as a deputy campaign director for Rudy Giuliani in 2008, which has raised eyebrows in some Democratic circles.)\n\nOver the past year, social media sites (primarily Facebook) have faced an onslaught of criticism from Republicans in Washington over baseless concerns that the platforms are unfairly censoring conservative speech. This has forced tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg to spend more time on Capitol Hill and speak directly with these lawmakers. On Monday, Politico reported that Zuckerberg has hosted a handful of \u201cinformal\u201d talks with conservative pundits and lawmakers like Ben Shapiro and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC).\n\nDemocrats are forcing this conversation in public, rather than behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cThe DNC in 2020 is running a campaign process to make sure that every single person has an opportunity to demonstrate that they are most qualified to be president, and I don\u2019t believe it would be our role to be airing ads every time there is misinformation,\u201d DNC chair Tom Perez told C-SPAN\u2019s Newsmakers last week.\n\nIf a campaign wants to run ads countering misinformation, they\u2019ll have to do it themselves, Perez said.\n\nThe DNC\u2019s strategy is to attack the institutions and platforms that are proliferating the ads riddled with mis- and disinformation. Some news outlets like CNN and MSNBC have vowed not to run these ads, so it\u2019s working on that front. However, with how Facebook and Twitter are responding, the Democrats\u2019 calls may fall on deaf ears.", "description": "The fight began after President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign flooded Facebook with ads spreading misinformation about Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and the Ukraine scandal that has dominated the news cycle.", "authors": ["Makena Kelly", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O3t-YbUpkAz9E1kFH_L2s4mUUUY=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12742467/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
