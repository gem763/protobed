Coach Markus Babbel said on Friday they might have to wait until the January transfer window before finding a quality replacement.\n\nThe Mariners reached the semi-finals of the FFA Cup under former Matildas coach Alen Stajcic, who accepted their head coaching job on a permanent basis after doing it for the final six rounds of last season.\n\n\"We know we can compete against anyone; we're not really scared of anyone,\" Stajcic said on Friday.\n\n\"I think we've just started seeing the green shoots of a little bit of belief and confidence and the ability to back themselves.\"\n\nBabbel said he thought the Mariners were the better team in their FFA Cup semi-final loss to Adelaide United, until captain Matt Simon was sent off, earning him a suspension which would keep him out of Saturday's game.\n\n\"You saw there's a team who is fighting 90 minutes, who give everything they have on the pitch,\" Babbel said.\n\n\"I believe, if we bring our performance on the pitch, we are better than Central Coast. If not, then it's a tough game.\"\n\nCentral Coast will be without South Korean midfielder Kim Eun-Sun and defender Ruon Tongyik due to leg injuries.\n\nStajcic said he had a potent mix of players capable of causing havoc, including former Socceroo winger Tommy Oar, Daniel De Silva - back from a season-long loan to Sydney FC - and highly regarded youngster Sam Silvera.\n\n\"Sammy has had a good pre-season and has shown that he can compete at this level, but he's just a young player and he's obviously got a lot to learn and a lot to grow from,\" Stajcic said.\n\nBabbel was optimistic captain and forward Mitch Duke, who was sidelined for several weeks of the pre-season, could play on Saturday, but suggested German defender Patrick Ziegler might not be ready yet, after recovering from a knee injury which had kept him out since January.", "description": "Two of the NSW also-rans in last season's A-League will be out to justify higher expectations when they clash on Saturday in the opening round.Western Sydney...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
