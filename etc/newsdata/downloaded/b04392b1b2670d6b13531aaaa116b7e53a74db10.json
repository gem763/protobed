The sense of the performance doesn\u2019t so much unfold as slowly seep into the audience\u2019s consciousness with growing horror \u2013 it\u2019s a study of grief, trauma and addiction based on a tragic event in Young\u2019s own life. The subject matter in itself carries enormous emotional clout, but it\u2019s the craft that elevates this piece to genius levels.\n\nBetroffenheit is not entirely typical of Canadian choreographer Pite\u2019s work, being a co-creation with writer and actor Young, a genuine integration of dance and theatre (a partnership they have continued in a new work, Revisor). But it makes sense that Pite would seek to synthesise with another artist, because when she creates she is always in conversation with something or someone. Whether that is mirroring the structure of Gorecki\u2019s music in Flight Pattern (2017), getting behind Shakespeare\u2019s text in The Tempest Replica (2011), responding to an article she has read or a conversation she\u2019s had, or collaborating with dancers on the creation of material. The ultimate conversation is with the audience. Pite wants to connect with the viewer. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important thing for me,\u201d she told me a few years ago. \u201cI really care about it so much. I don\u2019t know how to think about it any other way.\u201d\n\nPite wants to communicate something real, something legible, something meaningful. That doesn\u2019t mean serving up the obvious; she likes a \u201ccolossal, impossible subject\u201d. It energises her to work with content that she thinks is beyond her. So there is richness, complexity and texture, and playing with linear structure but never the wilful obfuscation of an artist proving their cleverness. Her work feels undeniably human, even when it veers into experimental territory.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest How many ways can bodies intertwine?

Some of her work connects to the problems of the real world. Flight Pattern, for example, made for the Royal Ballet, was a response to the refugee crisis that avoided cliche and clobbering you over the head with the issues and used a journalistic technique of zooming in on one person\u2019s experience to give power to the story of the masses.\n\nThen there\u2019s one-to-one connection between two people dancing. The pas de deux is one of the most common and most challenging templates in dance. How many ways can those bodies intertwine? How many ways can they say \u201cI love you,\u201d or maybe, \u201cI don\u2019t\u201d? But great choreographers can make even the most hackneyed setup blindingly new and essential again. Pite has the ability to turn these intimate conversations of limbs into something fresh, or sublime or crushingly real \u2013 like the man desperately chasing a woman, who when he finally gets her attention, can find nothing to say to her (from 2008\u2019s Ten Duets on a Theme of Rescue).\n\nThere is another strand to Pite\u2019s work, that on the surface seems to distance itself from personal connection. Works that use large groups of dancers en masse, as a morphing whole, rather than individuals; a reinvention of the corps de ballet. You can see this in The Seasons\u2019 Canon, for Paris Opera Ballet (2016), and perhaps most strikingly in Polaris (2014), created in London for an evening of dance set to the music of Thomas Ad\u00e8s. Pite found that the only way to match the vastness of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s eponymous composition was to flood the stage with 64 dancers, who moved like the galaxy itself expanding \u2013 a fractal of bodies, their impact multiplied to something almighty.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Predatory \u2026 Emergence by Crystal Pite at the Edinburgh festival in 2016. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian\n\nPolaris was a progression from a piece Pite made for the National Ballet of Canada in 2009, Emergence (later performed by Scottish Ballet), again harnessing the corps de ballet but turning them into something altogether more insectoid and predatory, moving in tightly orchestrated swarms. It\u2019s a work that could be seen as a stepping stone from William Forsythe\u2019s Artifact, the same celebration of ballet\u2019s precision and geometry, but with a more organic otherworldliness. (Pite danced with Forsythe\u2019s Ballett Frankfurt before moving into choreography and launching her company, Kidd Pivot.)\n\nThis mass movement seems like a simple idea, bodies moving in unison and canon, but it is deceptively difficult to achieve. Pite steps back to see the stage from the audience\u2019s point of view and the connection she makes here is with something innate in the viewer \u2013 the concord and inner logic of these large-scale configurations firing primal pleasure centres in the brain, as well as intellectual ones.\n\nPite comes across much like her work: thoughtful, intelligent, honest, warm, curious, with no trace of egotism. She is exactly the sort of person you want to have a conversation with.", "description": "Betroffenheit, our best dance show of the 21st century, takes the breath away \u2013 and reveals the Canadian trailblazer\u2019s superb craft", "authors": ["Lyndsey Winship"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe72a7c997c90967c5e985c9ea5ce413a1ef9811/0_170_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a4a9c288cbcf24ced25e1c15d35229cf", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
