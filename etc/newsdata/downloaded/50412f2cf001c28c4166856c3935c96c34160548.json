At that time, Trump was enraged by leaks that disclosed tough conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia on paying for the border wall and abiding by an Obama administration deal on asylum-seekers.\n\nThe White House\u2019s handling of Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders is now at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. A whistleblower alleges the White House tried to cover up Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s new president in which Trump asked Volodymyr Zelenskiy for help investigating Trump\u2019s Democratic rival Joe Biden, as well as other calls.\n\nThe former White House official confirmed there was an effort to limit access to Trump\u2019s calls, but offered an alternative explanation: The White House was trying to limit leaks of private conversations. CNN first reported on the White House effort.\n\nThe whistleblower is accusing Trump of using his office to \u201csolicit interference from a foreign country\u201d to help himself in next year\u2019s U.S. election.\n\nThe call came days after Trump ordered a freeze to some military assistance for Ukraine, Trump prodded Zelenskiy to dig for potentially damaging material on Biden, the former vice president who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and volunteered the assistance of both his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and his attorney general, William Barr.\n\nThe White House has acknowledged that a record of that call was sealed away in a highly classified system at the direction of Trump\u2019s National Security Council lawyers.\n\nThe former official noted that even some of Trump\u2019s calls with American allies were restricted due to the classified matters that arise during the discussions.\n\nAfter the disclosures about Trump\u2019s calls to the Australian and Mexican leaders, a White House adviser raised the possibility of lie detector tests for the small number of people in the West Wing and elsewhere with access to transcripts of Trump\u2019s phone calls.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "An ex-White House official says the administration is limiting access to memos of Trump calls with leaders amid his impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Zeke Miller"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19271008526207.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
