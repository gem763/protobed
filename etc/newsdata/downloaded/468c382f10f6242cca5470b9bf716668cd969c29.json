We\u2019ve been thinking about going back to school and finishing our degrees, because our employer is willing to pay for up to 10 credit hours, plus books, per semester with no strings attached. My parents think we should get student loans instead, so we can finish faster. We both have less than two years to go to complete our degrees, so what do you think?\n\nJanet\n\nDear Janet,\n\nWow, this is a fantastic opportunity! How many times does someone offer to pay for a college degree with no financial strings attached?\n\nI\u2019m sure your folks want what\u2019s best for you, but the truth is you probably couldn\u2019t take more than nine or 10 hours per semester, work full-time jobs, and keep your relationship and marriage healthy. If you\u2019ve both got less than two years of school left, it\u2019s not going to take that long, anyway. You\u2019re still young and have plenty of time to make this happen.\n\nI don\u2019t think your parents mean any harm, but they\u2019re wrong on this one. I\u2019ve got a feeling they\u2019re like most people in America today. They\u2019ve spent most of their lives swimming in debt, and they\u2019ve reached a point where they\u2019ve just accepted it and think there\u2019s no other way. To me, that\u2019s sad.\n\nIf you and your husband really want to finish your degrees, I\u2019d say the two of you need to march into work tomorrow morning, and take advantage of that wonderful offer. Stay away from debt!\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,My husband and I are in our twenties, and .10/25/2019 19:48:54PM EST.", "authors": ["Dave Ramsey", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/293/e1c1be77-6434-4a9d-93e6-942ee6282a4a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
