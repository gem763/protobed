At one time, it seemed like they had one of the best groups in the league. But the release of Antonio Brown and the team's decision to trade Demaryius Thomas left them a bit weaker at the position. And in recent weeks, they have been thin at the position due to injuries.\n\nPhillip Dorsett (hamstring), Josh Gordon (knee/ankle), and Julian Edelman (chest) have all been dealing with various maladies over the course of the first six weeks of the season. Additionally, first-round rookie N'Keal Harry has been on IR since just after the team's final cuts.\n\nWith these absences, some unexpected contributors have been able to step up. And one of them is Gunner Olszewski. The undrafted rookie out of Bemidji State has earned a big role as a return man and has recently seen an increase in offensive action. And so far, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has been impressed with his energy and effort.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\"Gunner works really hard,\" Belichick told reporters at Saturday's media availability. \"He gives a lot of effort to do, again, whatever we ask him to do. Whether that's return kicks, cover kicks, block, catch \u2013 he works really hard. Just gives his best all of the time, so you can't ask for anything more than that. He keeps getting better, so we'll see where it goes. But, yeah, he's a good, hard worker.\"\n\nBrady blasts media in Netflix cameo flap\n\nOf course, hard work is only part of the equation. In the Patriots' offense, it's important to have chemistry with Tom Brady. Has Olszewski done enough to earn Brady's trust so far?\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Yeah, definitely,\" Brady said when asked about his level of trust in Olszewski. \"I think they're \u2013 like I said, those guys are \u2013 when you're young, you gain trust in practice, and a lot of it's doing the right thing over and over and over again. Those guys are working at it. I mean, they've been here a short period of time, so try to get as many reps as you can and talk about things. You get coached up, and any young player, they're trying to earn the trust of the coach and the players every day.\"\n\nThis is seemingly the most positive Brady has felt about his young receiving weapons this year. Perhaps the team's success against the New York Giants despite being limited to only one formation because of their lack of healthy personnel had an impact on Brady. And maybe that helped him to become more confidence in Olszewski and fellow undrafted rookie Jakobi Meyers.\n\nEither way, Brady will likely have to look Olszewski's way a bit more than usual on Monday night against the New York Jets. Josh Gordon is out for the game and so too are tight ends Matt LaCosse and Ryan Izzo. That should afford Olszewski a good opportunity to make his presence felt.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
