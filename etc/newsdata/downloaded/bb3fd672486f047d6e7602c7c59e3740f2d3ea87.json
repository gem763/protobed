It's not just affecting one person, it's affecting the team.\u201d\n\nAbraham saw the scenes in Montenegro and they only hardened his resolve to tackle the matter.\n\nHe said: \u201cTo know what those guys were going through out there, it's not acceptable. No-one wants to see that. You just want to see the beautiful game.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAnd that\u2019s why he thinks racial abusers should not be given a second chance, saying: \u201cFor me personally, I think it's just one strike because it gives people excuses.\n\n\u201cOne time, twice, three times - it gives silly people excuses. Like we were all saying yesterday, if it happens and let's say there's a warning or whatever in the stadium, then it happens again, we have to make a decision as a team and with the staff.\u201d\n\nSterling has previously said that he is against walking off the field, saying how he would prefer to stay on and beat the opposition as a way of showing his defiance.\n\nBut he also explained how players are effected differently by the abuse and need support.\n\nAnd it is clear if just one of England\u2019s players feels too distressed or angry to carry on, the whole team will unite behind him.\n\nIf England did walk off in protest at any racial abuse without following UEFA protocol, they would face severe sanction.\n\nBut such is the strength of feeling within the squad, they would be prepared to risk punishment themselves.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nAbraham said: \u201cI think if that happens and we do decide to leave the field, obviously it's serious.\n\n\u201cWe'd let the FA or whoever deal with whatever's next, the scores or what happens with the points.\n\n\u201cAt the time, it's about making sure we're a team. We don't stand for it and we want the world to see that, that we don't stand for the silly abuse.\u201d\n\nWell said, Tammy.", "description": "England's players were racially abused in Montenegro back in March and are prepared to take a stand if it happens again", "authors": ["Andy Dunn", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542322.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILE-PHOTO-Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-England-v-Bulgaria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
