Am I the poo jogger?\u2019\u201d Jackie O revealed on air. \u201cMy own mother! She thought someone was starting a smear campaign against me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jackie O saw some of the news articles, she texted Jacenko and was \u201ckinda hoping maybe she would put it to bed and say to everyone, \u2018Listen, it\u2019s not Jackie O!\u2019\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not what happened when Jacenko appeared on The Project last night.\n\nSpeaking on the Channel 10 program about why she decided to delete the CCTV videos of the poo jogger from her Instagram account, Jacenko explained: \u201cI also don\u2019t want to put the person in the position where people are throwing around names on social media, one of them was Jackie O.\u201d\n\nA surprised Waleed Aly said to Jacenko, \u201cCan we just clarify you\u2019re not saying it\u2019s Jackie O, because you kind of went out of your way to say that was one of the names being mentioned on social media there.\u201d\n\nBut again, the PR Queen failed to rule the radio star out as a culprit.\n\n\u201cOne of them was Jackie O,\u201d Jacenko said on The Project. \u201cI was like, my goodness, this is terrible!\u201d\n\nJacenko then told The Project\u2019s Carrie Bickmore, \u201cIt\u2019s lucky you don\u2019t live in Sydney being a blonde and thin and nimble, it could have been you as well!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the controversial fitness trend that\u2019s sweeping the nation but it\u2019s leaving many Aussies poo-plexed. So in a world full of perfectly flushing toilets, why are people squatting one out on the street? pic.twitter.com/E0qoZHpAVn \u2014 The Project (@theprojecttv) October 15, 2019\n\nThis morning Kyle Sandilands played the audio of Jacenko\u2019s interview on The Project to Jackie O, and she was less than impressed.\n\n\u201cRoxy, what are you doing to me?!\u201d Jackie O said on air. \u201cCan I confirm it myself then? I am NOT the poo jogger, OK, it\u2019s not me!\u201d\n\nAs Kyle and Jackie O were discussing the brouhaha on radio this morning, Jackie O received a text from Jacenko which she read out on air.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I know you\u2019re not the poopinator!\u2019\u201d Jackie O revealed.\n\nKyle laughed and said to Jacenko who was listening at home, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you say it on television, for god\u2019s sake!\u201d", "description": "Jackie O wants everyone to know that she is not the poo jogger who has been defecating outside Roxy Jacenko\u2019s office.", "authors": ["Andrew Bucklow"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0b7de5f1694641f937608b5699f96c22?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
