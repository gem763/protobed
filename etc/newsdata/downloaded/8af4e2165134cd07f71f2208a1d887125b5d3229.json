Photo: Sophie Giraud/Hulu\n\nIn early 2017, Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale saw a renewed period of popularity. The year before, Hulu had announced that it would be adapting the 32-year-old dystopian novel for the screen, inspiring many readers to either return to the work or read it for the first time \u2014 an experience that became significantly more distressing after Donald Trump was elected president, lending the novel\u2019s themes around reproductive freedom and patriarchal oppression new relevance. (The novel\u2019s second period of popularity also inspired some shockingly ill-conceived Handmaid\u2019s-branded products.)\n\nWhen Atwood announced last November that she would be releasing a sequel called The Testaments, fans old and new celebrated, albeit cautiously. \u201cEverything you\u2019ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings will be the inspiration for this book,\u201d Atwood wrote in a social-media video. This book, she said explicitly, would be \u201cinspired by the world we\u2019ve been living in.\u201d\n\nTo say that The Testaments is highly anticipated is an understatement: One reviewer called it \u201cone of the most anticipated sequels of the modern age.\u201d Furthermore, despite being under strict embargo, it has already been nominated for major literary prizes, and is scheduled to be adapted for the screen.\n\nBelow, here\u2019s everything we know about the book so far: the plot, the critical response so far, and the upcoming TV adaptation.\n\nIt\u2019s set 15 years after The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale was set in the totalitarian Republic of Gilead, where all women are subjugated to men; the lowest-ranking women are forced to become handmaidens, who solely exist to procreate. Atwood left the first novel on a cliffhanger, with handmaiden Offred getting into a mysterious van that would either liberate her or take her to meet her death. In the sequel, which is set 15 years past where Handmaid\u2019s Tale left off, Offred doesn\u2019t personally figure into the plot. Her legacy, however, looms.\n\nGilead is still an oppressive patriarchal republic, and the main narrative of the sequel is centered on a mole who is \u201cworking with the Mayday resistance to help bring down the evil empire,\u201d per the New York Times\u2019s review of the book. But in lieu of one narrator, this book is told from the perspective of three women, whose identities are revealed to be Offred\u2019s two daughters, as well as the infamous Aunt Lydia, the brutal antagonist who instructs women before they become handmaids. (While Hulu has characterized Aunt Lydia as an unforgiving villain in their adaptation, multiple reviews of the book say that Atwood humanizes her, treating her as a more \u201ccomplex\u201d character.)\n\nThe book is under strict embargo, though early reviews are coming out.\n\nIn the past week alone, publications including the New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, and the Washington Post have published early reviews of The Testaments. Just today, the Guardian published the first excerpt of the book, which leads with an incredibly dark opening line: \u201cOnly dead people are allowed to have statues, but I have been given one while still alive. Already I am petrified.\u201d (The narrator later refers to herself as \u201can Aunt,\u201d so this excerpt is presumably from one of Aunt Lydia\u2019s sections.)\n\nIt\u2019s already up for literary awards \u2026\n\nIt is among five other titles shortlisted for the 2019 Booker Prize, and is on the long list for Canada\u2019s 2019 Giller Prize.\n\n\u2026 and will be adapted for the screen.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Time, Hulu and MGM announced that they are working to develop the sequel for the screen. As of now, though, Time reports that it is unclear \u201cwhether it will be folded into the existing Hulu series or developed as a separate work.\u201d\n\nThe response has been largely positive.\n\nOverall, the critical reception has been mostly positive: Entertainment Weekly, which gave the sequel a B+ rating, praised Atwood\u2019s prose as \u201clean, mean, and charged,\u201d and her pacing as \u201cflawless.\u201d Furthermore, Michiko Kakutani called the book \u201ccompelling\u201d in her review for the Times, and the Post\u2019s Ron Charles wrote that it\u2019s a \u201cbrisk thriller.\u201d\n\nBut the lack of substantive criticism \u2014 something expected in even the most positive of reviews \u2014 has been slightly peculiar. Though Kakutani does offer a critique, writing that the plot is \u201ca contrived and heavily stage-managed premise\u201d (though \u201cin a Dickensian sort of way with coincidences that reverberate with philosophical significance\u201d), it\u2019s difficult to infer whether she believes the book to be worthy of the immense amount of attention it has already received.\n\nPraise be, we hope!\n\nStay in touch.
