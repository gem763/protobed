As the nation\u2019s most important state economy, I believe NSW should have a greater say in how the system should work and part of that is helping drive a national conversation.\n\nWhat shape reform could take is clearly a matter for much debate, and the path to change is marked by battles which result in ideas reshaped and proposals cast aside. Such is the nature of politics.\n\nAs a small government Liberal, I have no interest in providing the government with more of other people\u2019s money. Simply increasing taxes is not tax reform.\n\nThis is not a hollow statement. In NSW we have cut more than $5 billion in taxes since 2016-17, including reducing payroll tax and indexing stamp duty brackets to the CPI.\n\nThe Terms of Reference for the Federal Financial Relations Review explicitly include the call that taxes need to be lower, simpler and fairer - as well as more efficient.\n\nThe question is not so much the amount of tax but the type and mix of taxes our revenue is raised from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, payroll tax can inhibit firms from expanding in size and creating jobs - it\u2019s a drag on activity. Stamp duty can stand in the way of families getting the keys to their first home or moving to where the jobs are.\n\nGiving people better access to jobs and increasing property ownership are key pillars of the Liberal aspiration agenda and initiatives we should promote. This stands alongside sensible fiscal management.\n\nThe commitment of the Morrison government to return the national budget to surplus is to be applauded. The low taxing agenda is a breath of fresh air compared to the high taxes and heavy regulation Labor proposed.\n\nThere is also little doubt big gains lie in reforming industrial relations, company tax cuts, expanding our resources sector and opening up our energy markets.\n\nI believe it is just as important to examine reforms which can boost productivity, lessen the burden of taxes and promote investment and growth.\n\nHawke, Keating, Howard, Costello - each bit the bullet, put the good of the nation above politics, and left our nation better than they found it.\n\nThat\u2019s our challenge too. Our entire nation\u2019s future prosperity is at stake - we are all invested, so let\u2019s hear all the arguments and decisively chart the course.\n\nThis is the conversation we have to have. Let\u2019s have it.", "description": "The only choice we face is whether we embrace reform and shape it, or ignore it until we are dragged kicking and screaming into the future we know is coming.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.363%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_101%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0a0167f50620d0bb72a0efe75859fb0c23f7df3b", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
