He was 95.\n\nDeclared a national hero within hours of his death by the long-serving aide who succeeded him as president, Mugabe was one of the most polarising figures in his continent\u2019s history - a giant of African liberation whose regime finally ended in ignominy when he was overthrown by his own army.\n\nHe died in Singapore, where he had long received medical treatment.\n\nGranting him the status of national hero in a televised address, President Emmerson Mnangagwa praised Mugabe an icon and a \u201cremarkable statesman of our century.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the backdrop and solid foundation of the first republic which he moulded as its leader, we today recover and grow,\u201d he said.\n\nMnangagwa, Mugabe\u2019s one-time security chief who helped oust him from power, had returned home earlier in the day after cutting short a trip to a World Economic Forum summit in South Africa.\n\nTributes poured in from African leaders. South Africa\u2019s government mourned a \u201cfearless pan-Africanist liberation fighter\u201d. Kenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta hailed a \u201cman of courage who was never afraid to fight for what he believed in, even when it was not popular\u201d.\n\nAt home, even foes paid respects.\n\n\u201cHe was a colossus on the Zimbabwean stage and his enduring positive legacy will be his role in ending white minority rule & expanding a quality education to all Zimbabweans,\u201d tweeted David Coltart, an opposition senator and rights lawyer.\n\nOthers said his legacy was overshadowed by the harm he did to his people.\n\n\u201cWe of course express our condolences to those who mourn, but know that for many he was a barrier to a better future,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Boris Johnson, prime minister of former colonial power Britain. \u201cUnder his rule the people of Zimbabwe suffered greatly as he impoverished their country and sanctioned the use of violence against them.\u201d\n\nOn the streets, the response was mostly more generous.\n\n\u201cHe was iconic, he was an African legend. His only mistake was that he overstayed in power,\u201d said Harare resident Onwell Samukanya. Another, Sellina Mugadza, said: \u201cOf course we know that you cannot do good to everyone, but to me he was good.\u201d\n\nRECONCILIATION AND DEATH SQUADS\n\nMugabe was feted as a champion of racial reconciliation when he first came to power in 1980 in one of the last African states to throw off white colonial rule.\n\nBy the time he was toppled to wild celebrations across the country of 13 million, he was viewed by many at home and abroad as a power-obsessed autocrat who unleashed death squads, rigged elections and ruined the economy to keep control.\n\nMugabe called his departure an \u201cunconstitutional and humiliating\u201d betrayal. Confined to his sprawling Harare mansion, he stayed bitter to the end.\n\nMugabe took power after seven years of a liberation war, with a reputation as \u201cthe thinking man\u2019s guerrilla\u201d. He held seven degrees, three earned behind bars as a political prisoner of then-Rhodesia\u2019s white minority rulers. Later, he would boast of another qualification: \u201ca degree in violence\u201d.\n\nJust three years after independence, he sent the army\u2019s North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade into the homeland of the Ndebele people to crush loyalists of his rival, Joshua Nkomo.\n\nHuman rights groups estimate as many as 20,000 people died in a two-year purge the opposition referred to as genocide.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe watches a video presentation during the summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Johannesburg, August 17, 2008. REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/File Photo\n\nVillages were destroyed wholesale, according to \u201cBreaking the Silence\u201d, a 1997 report by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, with some victims forced to dig their own graves.\n\nMany years later, he acknowledged the episode was \u201cvery bad\u201d and blamed it on renegade soldiers. Researchers say the evidence shows he knew what was happening all along.\n\nECONOMIC CRISIS\n\nIn fiery speeches throughout his rule he painted his actions as a just response to a racist colonial legacy, with his most important priority the redistribution of land held by whites.\n\nWhen he failed to change the constitution to allow seizure without compensation, his followers stormed farms. His enemies called it a lawless grab for power and wealth. Output cratered and southern Africa\u2019s breadbasket could barely feed itself.\n\nGDP fell by 40% and inflation reached 500 billion percent; he blamed a Western conspiracy.\n\nAs his health declined, his foes suspected a plan to pass control to a much younger wife they called \u201cGucci Grace\u201d for her lavish lifestyle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife,\u201d Chris Mutsvangwa, leader of Zimbabwe\u2019s influential liberation war veterans, told Reuters after Mugabe\u2019s removal.\n\nBorn on Feb. 21, 1924, on a Roman Catholic mission near Harare, Mugabe was educated by Jesuit priests and worked as a primary school teacher before going to South Africa\u2019s University of Fort Hare, then a breeding ground for African nationalism.\n\nReturning to then-Rhodesia in 1960, he entered politics and was jailed for a decade for opposing white rule. After his release, he rose to lead the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army guerrilla movement.\n\n\u201cYou have inherited a jewel in Africa. Don\u2019t tarnish it,\u201d Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere told him during the independence celebrations in Harare.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nJust under two years after his departure, Zimbabwe has yet to recover its lustre.\n\nBeset by triple-digit inflation, rolling power cuts and shortages of basic goods, the economy is mired in its worst crisis in a decade, while political opponents say a clampdown on dissent by Mnangagwa\u2019s government has revived memories of the Mugabe era.", "description": "Robert Mugabe, the bush war guerrilla who led Zimbabwe to independence and crushed his foes during nearly four decades of rule as his country descended into poverty, hyperinflation and unrest, died on Friday.
