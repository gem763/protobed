Kamala Harris speaks during the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention on Saturday. | Scott Eisen/Getty Images 2020 elections 'I didn\u2019t hear the words': Harris apologizes for response to mental disabilities slur\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris on Saturday apologized for her response to a rallygoer calling President Donald Trump's actions \"mentally retarded\" at a campaign event, saying that she didn't hear the slur.\n\nAs Harris addressed a crowd of voters at a town hall in New Hampshire on Friday, an attendee brought up Trump's potential impeachment before asking Harris, \"What are you going to do in the next one year, to diminish the mentally retarded actions\" of the president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe California senator drew ire from disability rights activists when she appeared to laugh at the remark, responding, \"Well said.\"\n\n\u201cWhen my staff played the video from my town hall yesterday, it was upsetting. I didn\u2019t hear the words the man used in that moment, but if I had I would\u2019ve stopped and corrected him. I\u2019m sorry. That word and others like it aren\u2019t acceptable. Ever,\u201d Harris wrote on Twitter on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"Let me just be really clear. I would never condone that kind of language being spoken by anybody about anybody,\" Harris said at the New Hampshire Democratic Party State Convention on Saturday when asked about the incident by an NBC News reporter. \"It is offensive. I have worked my entire career to do a number of things including insure our disability community the dignity and rights that they deserve.\"\n\n\"I would never condone anyone using that word in any way shape or form, even against the guy I am running against. Period,\" Harris continued.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Harris told Caitlin Huey-Burns of CBS that she had not \"processed\" that particular line.\n\n\"I heard him talk about the other stuff. And then that came later. And it was not something that I really heard or processed,\" Harris said.", "description": "\"That word and others like it aren\u2019t acceptable.
