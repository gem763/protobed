'My reaction was: Oh, God. I don't want to see those two things combined.'\n\n'Why did you wince and what did you mean by 'those two things combined'?' Todd asked in regards to the senator's previous comment, which set Johnson off on a seemingly-unrelated rant.\n\nIn his response, the 64-year-old senator issued a strong defense of the president before claiming Democrats and media should instead be focused on questioning former CIA Director John Brennan about then-CIA agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page's conversation about bias against Trump.\n\n'You've got John Brennan on,' Johnson said, referencing that Brennan would be appearing on NBC following his interview, 'you ought to ask Director Brennan, what did Peter Strzok mean when he texted Lisa Page on December 15, 2016, quote\u2014.'\n\nTodd attempted to cut off Johnson, but the two ended up just shouting over each other.\n\n'What does this have to do with Ukraine?' Todd demanded.\n\n'It has everything to do with Ukraine,' Johnson said.\n\nSenator Ron Johnson (right) and Chuck Todd (left) got into a 10-minute spat Sunday where the NBC news anchor accused the lawmaker of peddling 'Fox News propaganda'\n\nJohnson said instead of focusing on the Ukraine scandal, the Democrats and media should still be looking at then-CIA director John Brennan when 'lovebirds' Peter Strzok and Lisa Page exchanged text messages where they admitted to bias against Trump\n\nInstead of explaining why the former agents' texts that showed bias against Trump had to do with Trump's current scandal involving Ukraine, Johnson instead continued to read some of the messages and peddling a narrative that the CIA planted a false story that Russia was supporting the Trump campaign.\n\n'Who planted that false story? Who leaked? I have my third letter into the Inspector General of the intelligence community asking just to confirm, to just confirm: are you investigating those leaks that Peter Strzok talked about in the text to Lisa Page?' Johnson said.\n\nThe anchor audibly groaned and sighed several times during Johnson's response.\n\n'I have no idea why Fox News propaganda stuff is popping up on here,' Todd said. 'I have no idea why we're going here.'\n\n'Because this is underlining exactly why President Trump is upset, and why his supporters are upset with the news media!' Johnson said.\n\nJohn Brennan (pictured left) appeared on Meet the Press shortly after Johnson and said Trump is a 'bully' that has Republicans 'running scared'\n\n'Senator Johnson, please!' Todd said. 'Can we please answer the question that I asked you, instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you're not criticizing him?! I'm just trying to ask a simple question of what made you wince?'\n\n'Because I didn't want those connected,' Johnson said of the potential probe and military aid the Trump administration froze days before his call with the Ukrainian president.\n\n'When I asked the president about that, he completely denied it. He adamantly denied it. He vehemently, angrily denied it. He said, 'I'd never do that.'' Johnson said.\n\nThe exchange between Todd and Jonhson lasted nearly 10 minutes, and after that, Brennan was up for an interview with the already hyped-up for the Obama-era CIA director.\n\nBrennan said he became the 'boogey-man,' and caused such an uproar in Johnson's interview because of Trump.\n\n'Well I think it all goes back to Mr. Trump and his dishonesty,' Brennan started.\n\n'He has continued to fabricate information and clearly Senator Johnson is running scared of Donald Trump as are the other Republican Senators, because if they say anything against him, he comes after them with a vengeance,' Brennan said.\n\n'So he is the typical bully. And so now I have become being pilloried as an example of the deep state.'", "description": "A Republican senator was accused on Sunday of trying to push 'Fox News propaganda' while appearing on NBC for an interview.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/22/19371242-0-image-a-5_1570397254330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
