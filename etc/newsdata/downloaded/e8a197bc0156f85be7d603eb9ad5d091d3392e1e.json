He held the drone aloft rather than trying to fly it and handed himself in to police at Terminal 2.\n\nHeathrow Pause said it had completed one flight with a toy drone but other attempts had been less successful. It posted a live stream of its early-morning activities near the airport online, and said its drones had suffered from signal jamming.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a little technical glitch. The drone isn\u2019t flying,\u201d an unidentified campaigner says in the video, as another holds a drone in the air.\n\nA police vehicle is seen parked near Heathrow airport after climate activists said they planned to fly drones near the airport, in London, Britain, September 13, 2019. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nDetermined to avoid disruption, police invoked extra powers to move people away from the area around the airport until Sunday morning.\n\n\u201cThe order has been implemented to prevent criminal activity which poses a significant safety and security risk to the airport,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nOn Friday, they arrested two men at the airport on suspicion of conspiracy to commit a public nuisance, and said seven others had been arrested since Thursday.\n\nHeathrow Pause is a splinter group of Extinction Rebellion, which blocked streets in central London this year. It had said it would fly the drones no higher than head height and had no wish to endanger life.\n\nAir travel accounts for just 2.5% of global carbon emissions, but the industry is attempting to reconcile airlines\u2019 growth plans with a pledge to cut carbon emissions.\n\nA study by the International Council on Clean Transportation said in a report on Thursday that the increase in emissions from U.S. airlines was overtaking improvements in fuel efficiency.\n\nHeathrow Pause opposes the expansion of Heathrow, whose proposed third runway was approved by lawmakers last year after decades of delays and policy U-turns.\n\nA drone is pictured near Heathrow Airport in London, Britain, September 12, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nA spokesman for the group said it did not need to disrupt flights to achieve its goal.\n\n\u201cThe real objective was always to trigger a sensible, honest conversation, throughout society, on the dangerous folly of Heathrow expansion, with the ultimate objective of cancelling the third runway,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat conversation is now happening.\u201d", "description": "Climate-change activists who had hoped to bring Europe's biggest airport, London Heathrow, to a standstill on Friday found instead that it was their drones that struggled to get off the ground.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429368659&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0EX", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
