But there\u2019s a catch: there are more shovels than hands.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man cleans debris in the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis in Yanagawamachi district, Date City, Fukushima prefecture, Japan October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun/File Photo\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s government has agreed to use $6.5 million for immediate disaster relief, looks set to tap into budget reserves of $5 billion, and may request more money to finance construction after Typhoon Hagibis tore through much of Japan\u2019s main island this month, killing 79 with seven still missing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take fiscal steps, including a supplementary budget if necessary, so that disaster-hit local governments can do the utmost on rebuilding,\u201d Abe said.\n\nBut however much Abe spends, a severe labor shortage means his government will struggle to repair levee breaks and other damage across a broad swath of the country.\n\nConstruction is one of the most squeezed industries in the nation\u2019s tightest job market since the 1970s.\n\nAs Japan\u2019s population greys and shrinks, the supply of construction workers has slumped by 28% from its peak in the late 1990s to around 5 million. Yet demand remains robust amid a nearly seven-year economic expansion and the approach of next year\u2019s the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe construction industry has 5.3 job openings for every applicant, latest government data show, a ratio second only to that of security guards and far above the overall ratio of 1.6, which is the highest in decades.\n\nLABOR CRUNCH\n\nThe scale of Hagibis, in which 71 rivers burst 140 levees and other embankments over vast areas from Nagano, central Japan to Iwate in the far northeast of the main island, means the job of fixing the damage is vast.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely short of workers,\u201d said Yoshiaki Suzuki, president of the six-man construction firm Suzuki Kenzai Kogyo in Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo, which flooded three times since early September.\n\nTateyama, where Suzuki lives, was still recovering from massive flooding and long power outages caused by Typhoon Faxai last month when Hagibis hit on Oct. 12-13. On Friday and Saturday, a third storm inundated the city, killing 10 in Chiba Prefecture and dumping as much as 283.5 millimeters (11 inches) of rain on some areas over 12 hours.\n\n\u201cOur top priority is to restore lifelines, repair roads and cover the damaged roofs with blue plastic sheets,\u201d Suzuki told Reuters. \u201cThere\u2019s no time for removing the heaps of rubble caused by the last two typhoons.\u201d\n\nDestabilized soil from earlier storms has led to fresh landslides, making work hazardous for people still digging out, he said.\n\nThe shortage of construction workers is most pronounced in rural Japan, where the population and construction projects are in steep decline. Highly skilled workers tend to head to bigger cities, said Fumitaka Miura, director at the Research Institute of Construction and Economy, a private think-tank.\n\nGOING HIGH-TECH\n\nTo address the worker shortage, some construction companies are embracing technology.\n\nFor example, some companies fly drones over construction sites for three-dimensional measuring. The data is fed into machines that design, plan and implement projects, say officials at the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry. These \u201ci-Construction\u201d techniques can cut working hours by 30%, they say.\n\nTechnological solutions like these are deployed in 60% of large-scale construction projects, the officials say.\n\nBut most of the disaster recovery will be done with bricks, mortar, equipment and manual labor.\n\nSpeculation is mounting that Abe may ask for more funds in an extra budget at the end of the year, as the longest postwar economic boom sputters amid global trade wars and the government watches the impact of a sales tax increase this month.\n\nYasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities, says the government is likely to earmark $5 billion-$10 billion for infrastructure rebuilding, while longtime Japan strategist Jesper Koll forecasts something more like $20 billion-$30 billion, given the \u201cneed for fast and decisive government action.\u201d", "description": "Ravaged by a series of storms, including the worst typhoon in decades, Japan is ramping up spending on rescue, repair and clean-up.
