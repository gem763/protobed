He may not be of Tongan heritage \u2013 despite what too many pundits were appearing to claim on Sunday evening \u2013 but a chance to play against a Polynesian side still meant an awful lot to the 28-year-old, such are his Samoan roots.\n\nAnd, while the rest of the 35,923 in attendance at the Sapporo Dome watched a terrifying Sipi Tau before kick-off, Tuilagi merely stood there, taking it all in and using that Tongan display of aggression to fuel the fire within him.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It was brilliant.\n\n\u201cIt definitely fired us all up for that game. It definitely fired me up watching that. It was good to be standing in front of it. It\u2019s an unbelievable experience. I haven\u2019t done that before. I\u2019ve only played Fiji before \u2013 where they perform the Cibi \u2013 but the first time against Tonga was unreal.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s performance had been a long time coming on the biggest stage, given Tuilagi was forced to miss the 2015 World Cup through injury and ill-discipline. Eight years ago, he made headlines for the right reasons with tries against Georgia and Romania, before making headline for the wrong reasons after jumping off a ferry into Auckland harbour soon after England\u2019s quarter-final elimination.\n\nThis is a different Tuilagi now, a father who took delight in receiving messages from his wife, daughter and family after the game, rather than any boozy celebrations. But the aspects of his game remain the same as they ever were: unmatchable power, brute strength and the ability to inflict damage on the opposition time after time that not only opens opportunities for him, but for his teammates too.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to use Manu in the right way,\u201d said his club and country colleague George Ford. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a case of just giving him the ball and saying \u2018go on Manu, run into five blokes\u2019. You\u2019ve got to use him wisely to try to get him one-on-ones because ultimately he\u2019ll break that tackle for us and get a line break or quick ball at the very least.\n\n\u201cThat was probably what we were trying to do in terms of being patient and strike at the right time. Elliot [Daly] gave a brilliant ball to Jonny [May] and Manu had a great support line, so it\u2019s just using him in different ways. You saw he carried the ball a lot as well, particularly from first phase as he broke some tackles, but you can use him as a decoy as well which is great.\u201d\n\nPlayers like Tuilagi bring the best out of others on his side, both through their performance and knowing that the man standing next to them is genuinely world class. It is hard to think of another centre quite like him currently in world rugby \u2013 perhaps the closest is New Zealand\u2019s Sonny Bill Williams or Australia\u2019s Samu Kerevi, but even they cannot match his strength in the collision.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s is showing everyone what a great player he truly is,\u201d added Maro Itoje. \u201cThis is going to be the longest period he\u2019s been healthy for a couple of years. Day by day he is getting better. Over the last two years, in camp, he\u2019s been amazing to watch because he has upped his preparation with getting his body right and I think that is paying dividends.\u201d\n\nThe same message emitted from Billy Vunipola \u2013 the other man in white with roots in the Pacific Islands.\n\nVunipola found himself targeted by the Tongans in what felt like a pre-construed message to remind him of what being a Tongan really means. The difference was that, where Vunipola had to ride the rough treatment before getting the better of the opposition, Tuilagi simply gave it back to them \u2013 and then some.\n\nHis walloping tackle on the left wing Viliami Lolohea was on the limit of being legal, while his ability to skittle defenders like a bowling ball brought huge success. There are not many players who would have finished his first try, breaking the tackle of Leicester Tigers teammate Sione Kalamafoni and carrying two others across the line with him.\n\nTo put that into comparison, Kalamafoni smashed Anthony Watson into next week with a bone-crunching tackle, but there was nothing he could do about Tuilagi.\n\n\u201cThe guy is a machine,\u201d said Vunipola. \u201cThe way he scored that first try, shrugged off two or three people and got over was pretty awesome to watch. We are very lucky to have him on the team.\u201d\n\nWith Tuilagi, it is impossible not to fear that the worst could be looming just around the corner. A man who is built to what essentially is breaking point will every now and then \u2026 break, and unfortunately his career shows that happens more often than not.\n\nBut he is being managed correctly by both Leicester and England these days, and if Eddie Jones and his side can find the optimum way to get the most out of him while using his talents sparingly, he undoubtedly has the tools to be England most valuable player at Japan 2019.", "description": "If it was unclear just how important Manu Tuilagi is to England\u2019s Rugby World Cup assault, then Sunday\u2019s double-try salvo made it crystal clear.
