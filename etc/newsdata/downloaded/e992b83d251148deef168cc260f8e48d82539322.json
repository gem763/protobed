The Sierra Club then filed a lawsuit Wednesday in the D.C. District Court.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re essentially arguing that the public does not have a right to know what, if anything, is supporting his claims,\u201d said Matthew Miller, an attorney for the Sierra Club.\n\n\u201cThe EPA either needs to admit there is in fact no support for the administrator\u2019s statement and they need to set the record straight that he was misleading and inaccurate,\u201d Miller said. \u201cOr they need to provide us with whatever unknown basis of support they are relying on \u2014 which is apparently none \u2014 and which would be contrary to the overwhelming scientific consensus and his own agency\u2019s scientists' research.\u201d\n\nAn EPA spokesman said in an email Thursday that while the agency would not comment on pending litigation, \"experts from EPA and other organizations like the [United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] regularly measure climate change impacts, including the effects of regulation, in multi-decadal time frames, not year-to-year variations.\"\n\nWheeler\u2019s April statement contradicted numerous government reports which call for a sense of urgency in battling climate change.\n\nAlmost all climate scientists have concluded that the effects of human-caused climate change are already taking place.\n\nThe FOIA process has previously been used by environmental groups to challenge EPA statements about climate change.\n\nIn August 2018, a suit forced the EPA to acknowledge that now-former Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittEPA on 'forever chemicals': Let them drink polluted water EPA moving ahead with science transparency rule by 'early next year' Overnight Energy: Trump administration to repeal waterway protections| House votes to block drilling in Arctic refuge| Administration takes key step to open Alaskan refuge to drilling by end of year MORE failed to back up his reasoning with science when he claimed humans are not the central cause of climate change.\n\nPruitt told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\" in 2017 that humans were not a \"primary contributor to the global warming that we see.\"\n\nPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility filed a FOIA request, and after a lawsuit secured Pruitt\u2019s preparation notes, none of which referenced climate change.", "description": "The Sierra Club sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday after the agency refused to turn over any documents to back up Administrator Andrew Wheeler\u2019s claim that climate change \u201cis 50 to 75 years", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/wheelerandrew_040219sr4_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
