They are included now in a book of his photographs called The End of Industry, but at the time Myers had no sense that the foundries and yards they depicted would shortly join many other iron and steel and metal-bashing companies in the region and be gone for good.\n\nMyers, born in 1944, a student and then lecturer in fine art, had during the 70s been taking sly social realist photographs of his suburban neighbourhood in Stourbridge, and of more urban Dudley and beyond. \u201cWe spend a lot of our lives blocking out the world that we live in, just how awful it is, just how boring it is,\u201d he says. His photography, inspired equally by the pioneering documentarist Eug\u00e8ne Atget and the urban American geometries of Ed Ruscha, was all about looking, about not blocking out. Some of the pictures that have become known as \u201cthe boring pictures\u201d were careful series of dual carriageways, electricity substations and idle televisions in the corners of neat, pinched sitting rooms.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Controlled Heat Treatments factory, 1983.

He was involved in Labour politics, but the pictures were not intended to be polemical in any narrow sense, rather to show the industrial landscape as it was. The pace of factory closures that struck the Black Country was impossible to predict, even at the closest quarters. He had no sense that what he was photographing would look in retrospect like a final chapter. \u201cCompanies folded and factories were demolished at an unbelievably rapid rate in the couple of years after these pictures,\u201d he says now, looking back. \u201cPeople in that area had got used to that way of life since the Industrial Revolution \u2013 good employment, reasonable wages \u2013 and then that was all just clobbered overnight.\u201d\n\nUnlike the shipyards and docklands of the north-east or the mills and textile factories of Manchester, the relatively small-scale chain-making operations of Cradley Heath, the foundries of Brierley Hill and the brickworks of Kingswinford did not lend themselves to being recast as warehouse apartments. Many were simply flattened; others emptied out as goods yards and storage facilities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A mould maker at Higgins & Son, in Lye, 1985.\n\n\u201cThe big shock,\u201d Myers says, \u201cwas the new landscape that emerged from that clearance, of warehousing and logistics and retail parks and enterprise zones and tarmac.\u201d Local people, he suggests, are still living with the abrupt loss of human scale.\n\nMyers made the portraits in this series, like all the work of that time, with a \u201ccloth-over-the-head\u201d Gandolfi camera. The long exposure perhaps added to the air of resignation in the foundry worker\u2019s face, or in the shoulders of the woman beside her table piled with muck in the brick factory, or the concentration in the posture of the lathe operator.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lathe operator, Higgins & Son, Lye, 1985.

The foundry worker in his beret is impossible to isolate from any of the objects that surround him; the looped chain, and the sluice and the metal pail and the corrugated doorway and the pile of steel moulds are as essential to the scene as he is. The effect Myers was hoping for was to render the people as simply another element in spaces that they had probably known all of their working lives, \u201cas if it was their living room\u201d.\n\nMyers stopped taking photographs in 1990, and has devoted much of his subsequent creative life to painting, while continuing to work in higher education in Stourbridge. He had sent some of his photographs out to galleries in the 1980s but there was no interest. \u201cAt the time,\u201d he says, \u201cpeople looked at them but, as it were, didn\u2019t see them.\u201d Most of the photographs in the current book were not even printed up. His work \u2013 the \u201cboring photographs\u201d first \u2013 was rediscovered by the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, and featured at Martin Parr\u2019s national photography archive in Bristol. There was a significant exhibition of these industrial photographs in Bologna last year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cradley Foundry, Quarry Bank, 1983.\n\nMyers is somewhat amused, but also gratified, by the sudden late exposure. \u201cThe fact was,\u201d he says, \u201cyou didn\u2019t get that many international art dealers hovering around in Stourbridge.\u201d He does not think that the new interest has come entirely by chance, however. We are at a moment in British political life in which we are trying to understand how on earth we got here. The legacy of those brutally abrupt changes in the years of Myers\u2019s photographs are still unravelling in the places they depict. \u201cWhat was happening to Britain in 1985 perhaps explains a lot of what is happening in 2019,\u201d he says.\n\nThe End of Industry by John Myers, published by RRB PhotoBooks, \u00a375, is out now", "description": "Photographer John Myers documented the industry of the West Midlands as it collapsed under Thatcherism", "authors": ["Tim Adams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/259d827165c037ee6cb5b078567889168a3804e9/0_375_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1eaf0daa75259fa3b2d7eab9151806cd", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
