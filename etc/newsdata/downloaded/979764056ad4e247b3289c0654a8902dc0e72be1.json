Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) leaves a courthouse in New York after a pretrial hearing on his insider-trading case on Sept. 12. (Seth Wenig/AP)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Rep. Chris Collins is resigning from Congress and expected to plead guilty to insider-trading charges on Tuesday, following allegations last year that the Republican from New York schemed with his son to avoid significant losses on a biotechnology investment.\n\nCollins, President Trump\u2019s first congressional supporter, allegedly tipped off his son to confidential information about an Australian biotechnology company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, that he learned as a member of its board. Collins and several others used the information to avoid more than $700,000 in losses, according to prosecutors.\n\nHe is scheduled to change his plea Tuesday afternoon in a Manhattan federal court.\n\nCollins\u2019s son, Cameron; and another family member are scheduled to change their pleas on Thursday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) received a letter of resignation from Collins on Monday, a senior Democratic aide said. The resignation will be effective when the letter is officially filed at a scheduled House session Tuesday.\n\nCollins\u2019 attorney did not respond to an email and phone call seeking comment.\n\nCollins, who once called the charges against him \u201cmeritless,\u201d has since 2013 represented New York\u2019s 27th Congressional District, which encompasses suburban and rural areas stretching east of the Buffalo metropolitan area.\n\n[Rep. Chris Collins charged with insider trading, federal prosecutors announce]\n\nCollins won reelection last year after initially suspending his campaign, then reversing that decision despite pressure from Republicans to step aside and allow another GOP candidate on the ballot. Collins was sworn in for a fourth term in January but was not seated on any House committees pending resolution of his indictment.\n\nSeveral candidates have announced campaigns to challenge Collins in 2020, including GOP state Sens. Chris Jacobs and Rob Ortt as well as Democratic lawyer Nate McMurray, who came about 1,000 votes shy of unseating Collins last year. Should Collins resign, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) would set a special election for the coming months.\n\nDespite Collins\u2019s close reelection race, the 27th District is considered reliably Republican \u2014 Trump won it by 24 points in 2016.\n\nCollins was among Trump\u2019s earliest endorsers and continued speaking out on his behalf after being indicted \u2014 including as recently as last week, when the congressman issued a statement criticizing Democrats\u2019 announcement of a formal impeachment investigation of Trump. The White House and fellow Republicans, however, have kept their distance from Collins.\n\nCollins was indicted in August 2018 and had been fighting the charges. Innate Immunotherapeutics was developing a new therapy for multiple sclerosis. Collins served on the company\u2019s board of directors and was its largest shareholder, according to a federal indictment.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, while at the June 2017 congressional picnic at the White House, Collins received an email from Innate Immunotherapeutics' chief executive alerting the company\u2019s board that an eagerly anticipated drug trial had been a failure. Minutes later, Collins responded to the email: \u201cWow. Makes no sense. How are these results even possible???\u201d\n\nCollins immediately tried to contact his son, who owned millions of Innate Immunotherapeutics shares, according to the indictment. Within a few minutes, Collins and his son called each other six times before connecting and talking for six minutes. During that call, Collins told his son about the failed drug trial, according to the indictment, which cites phone and bank records as well as texts.\n\nWith that insider knowledge, Collins and his family were able to avoid significant losses before the news became public and the company\u2019s stock price fell more than 90 percent, prosecutors allege.", "description": "The Republican from New York, among Trump\u2019s earliest endorsers, had called the charges against him \u2018meritless\u2019 but is scheduled to change his plea Tuesday afternoon.", "authors": ["Renae Merle", "Reporter Covering White-Collar Crime", "Wall Street", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "September At Pm", "Renae Merle Covers White-Collar Crime", "Wall Street For The Washington Post.
