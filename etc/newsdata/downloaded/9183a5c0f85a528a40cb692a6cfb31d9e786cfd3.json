It can be completely overwhelming especially if you\u2019re used to a regular schedule,' she said.\n\n'Since I\u2019ve become a mom, I\u2019m always putting my son, Chase\u2019s needs first which is completely normal when you\u2019re a parent. When it comes to working out, each day is a gamble when you have a baby.\n\n'As much as I\u2019d like to be organized throughout my week with my exercise schedule, things always change last minute. Chase might have difficulty sleeping, teething or he could just need a bit more attention. When that happens, it definitely becomes a struggle to fit a good workout into my day.\n\n'When you feel ready to begin your fitness journey, it will be more enjoyable and you\u2019ll most likely stick to it. Sometimes, I even incorporate Chase into my workouts (for instance, doing squats while holding him straight out with my arms) and he loves it!'\n\nThe lifestyle blogger, who writes about beauty, fashion and fitness at Chasing Maria , said that you should be kind to yourself when you've had a baby\n\nMaria, who is also a qualified yoga teacher, started off slowly with her fitness routine and did just two days of exercise per week and now she has built it up to a minimum of four times per week\n\nStart slow\n\nMaria admits that her body changed a lot after her pregnancy: 'I was discouraged about my new body type because before pregnancy I was quite skinny and worked out every single day. But now, when I look at myself in the mirror, I feel curvy, strong and powerful. I think becoming a mom has created a new form of confidence in me and I\u2019ve never felt stronger!\n\nMaria, who is also a qualified yoga teacher, started off slowly with her fitness routine and did just two days of exercise per week and now she has built it up to a minimum of four times per week.\n\n'My diet was also important for getting my post-baby body back into shape. In the beginning, I only ate foods that were high in protein and lots of vegetables. As long as you\u2019re eating moderately clean, you should bounce back in a timely manner!\n\nHowever Maria, who is married to actor and model Nick Bateman (left), said that you should still have cheat days and admits that she loves to eat pasta\n\nHer 'cheat' workout\n\nMaria, who also shares her workout videos on her blog, admits that she loves her resistance band as you can just use it at home and when she travels: 'For most of my exercises, I usually start off by placing a resistance band one inch above my knees.\n\n'Then, in a squatting position, side-step back and forth across the room a few times keeping as low as you can to the ground without coming up.\n\n'Always be mindful of not allowing your knees to go forward over your toes. This exercise is a great cardio warm up and it\u2019s good for your glutes.'\n\nShe went on to say that the workouts which work the best for her are ones which she knows are helping her towards her fitness goals: 'Right now my fitness goal is to grow a muscular booty!\n\n'So, I find jump squats, lunges, burpees, and deadlifts to be super effective for strengthening and toning my quads and glutes.'\n\nMaria, when she was pregnant, she said that she loves her resistance band to get back into shape - as you can just use it anytime at home, and she uses it when she travels too\n\nMaria, who is a busy mother, says that children grow up so quickly. Pictured: Feeding Chase in bed with their two dogs\n\nBe careful not to over due it\n\nThe mom-of-one admits that she didn't workout at all for two and a half months because as she had to recover from her postpartum.\n\n'At first, I was so wrapped up with Chase and juggling this new title of becoming a mom. But after taking some time off to just enjoy becoming a parent, I slowly started to get back into a light workout routine.\n\n'I think every parent should take their time with their little one because they honestly grow up so fast! My little guy just turned one-year-old and I don\u2019t know where the time went!\n\nHowever, even when she was cleared to exercise she struggled with core exercises. 'I had a hard time doing planks or any sort of abdominal exercise and it was very frustrating because prior to pregnancy, my core was extremely strong and my ab muscles were very prominent.\n\n'A year later, I\u2019m still building my core strength back up and I know this will take some time and patience!\n\nThe mom-of-one admits that she didn't workout at all for two and a half months because as she had to recover from her postpartum. Pictured: with Chase in the park\n\nMaria admits to have cheat days - however she has reduced her wine consumption to a glass or two on weekends\n\nAvoid saturated fats but have a CHEAT day\n\nA typical weekly diet for Maria means eating foods that are high in protein and low in carbs. 'I also eat a LOT of vegetables and avoid foods that are high in saturated fats. My husband and I have a \u2018cheat day\u2019 once a week, usually on the weekend, where we'll go carb-happy and have Italian pasta dishes!\n\nBut if you have that pasta, have it earlier on in the day: 'If I want a heavy meal like pasta, I\u2019ll have it for lunch instead of dinner so I can use the remaining hours in your day to burn off those extra calories.\n\n'I also found that staying hydrated was extremely helpful as well as not eating three hours prior to sleeping.'\n\nThe lifestyle blogger and Instagram star, also admits she saw drastic changes after cutting out both dairy and sugar\n\nPictured: Maria with one-year-old Chase. She said that after a month of giving up sugar she shed inches off her abdominal area\n\nDiet swaps\n\nThe lifestyle blogger and Instagram star, also admits she saw drastic changes after cutting out both dairy and sugar.\n\n'Cutting out dairy to help me shed stored fat in my body and I also reduced my wine consumption to a glass or two on weekends. Plus, adding three cups of green tea per day (if you\u2019re not breastfeeding) to your diet will also help speed up your metabolism.'\n\n'The biggest change I\u2019ve seen in my body came from cutting out sugar for a month. It was an extremely hard self-challenge because I have a massive sweet tooth, but I did it!\n\n'Since sugar can cause weight gain and mood swings (not to mention it\u2019s extremely addictive) I found the first 10 days to be really hard. But I powered through and after the month was up, I had shed inches off my abdominal area!'", "description": "Maria Bateman, 33, from Los Angeles, who has 194,000 followers on Instagram, said that her trick is to carry a resistance band so that you can fit in a workout wherever you go.", "authors": ["Sarah Finley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19292564-0-image-a-12_1570185327673.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
