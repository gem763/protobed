In 2017 she wore a burgundy leather coat over her shoulders at the Invictus Games, while she was first seen sporting the trend in 2014.\n\nShe joins other celebrities, such as Anna Wintour, Victoria Beckham, Kim Kardashian and Princess Diana, who have championed the look.\n\nTonight, as Meghan attended the WellChild Awards, was no exception, as she showed off her style credentials by draping, or 'shrobing' her \u00a31185 camel coat by Sentaler, over her fitted green wool dress by P.A.R.O.S.H.\n\nShe was spotted in a burgundy leather shrobe while supporting Prince Harry during the Invictus Games in 2017\n\nWhile the 'shoulder-robe' - shortened to shrobing by fashion insiders - is more typically seen on fashion editors on the front row than the likes of senior royals, Meghan isn't the first member of the royals to adopt the draping technique.\n\nThat accolade goes to her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, who was doing it as far back as 1981.\n\nMeghan was first pictured with her jacket draped over her shoulders back in 2014.\n\nJust a month before her wedding, Meghan accompanied Harry to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and sported a Camilla and Marc blazer artfully draped over her shoulders, rather than putting her arms through the sleeves.\n\nMegan watches Prince Harry during the presentations at the Audi polo Challenge, Coworth Park, Ascot in July 2018\n\nJust a month before her wedding, Meghan accompanied Harry to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and sported Camilla and Marc blazer artfully draped over her shoulders, rather than putting her arms through the sleeves (left).

Just like Victoria Beckham has perfected turning every single handbag, no matter how big, into a clutch, she has been a pioneer of the jacket drape too.\n\n'Fashion editors have been doing it for decades. You only have to Google pictures of Anna Wintour or Diana Vreeland to see.\n\nMeghan embraced the trend around the same time as it hit the front rows of fashion week first pictured with her jacket draped over her shoulders in 2014 (pictured)\n\nShe continued to rock the style throughout her time as an actress seen at fashion week in 2014 (left) and on the Today Show in 2016 (right)\n\n'There is something effortlessly chic about 'caping' your jacket. A leather jacket draped over a form-fitting dress is Meghan's favourite look.\n\n'Think of it as the new version of tying a preppy jumper round ones neck.
