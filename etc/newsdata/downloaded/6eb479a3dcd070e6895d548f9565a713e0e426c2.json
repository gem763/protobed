(The number commemorates the year of Lamborghini's founding, 1963.) The name, Si\u00e1n, means \"bolt of lightning\" in the traditional Bolognese dialect of Lamborghini's northern Italian home, according to Lamborghini.\n\nInstead of batteries, as in most hybrid cars, the Si\u00e1n uses a supercapacitor.\n\nThe Si\u00e1n is a \"mild hybrid,\" meaning it will still rely mostly on its gas-powered 774 horsepower V12 engine. Combined with a 34 horsepower electric motor, the car will be capable of producing a total of 808 horsepower\n\nThe car will be able to go from zero to more than 60 miles an hour in under three seconds and will have a top speed of more than 217 miles an hour. The car's hybrid system adds 10% to its speed, according to Lamborghini. The small electric motor will also smooth out power flow as the car shifts gears, minimizing the jerking sensation felt as it shifts\n\nInstead of using a lithium-ion battery of the sort used in most hybrid cars, the Si\u00e1n has a lightweight supercapacitor mounted just behind the passenger compartment. Similar to other hybrid cars, the Si\u00e1n will charge its supercacitor while the driver is braking, then use that stored energy at low speeds and during acceleration.\n\nRead More", "description": "Lamborghini will unveil its first hybrid car at the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany next week.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190903111552-01-lamborghini-sian-super-tease.jpg"}
