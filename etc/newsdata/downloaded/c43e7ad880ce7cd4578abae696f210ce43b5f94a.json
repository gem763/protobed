What\u2019s more, it\u2019s far simpler and cheaper to make than the batteries currently in use in millions of electric vehicles around the world \u2013 and, unlike them, it can easily be recycled.\n\nThis might sound like a science-fiction fantasy. But it\u2019s not. Last Friday, the battery\u2019s inventor, British engineer and former Royal Navy officer Trevor Jackson, signed a multi-million-pound deal to start manufacturing the device on a large scale in the UK.\n\nThe father-of-eight battery inventor engineer, Trevor Jackson, 58 from Tavistock, Devon, who has signed a multi-million-pound deal to start manufacturing the device on a large scale in the UK\n\nAustin Electric, an engineering firm based in Essex, which now owns the rights to use the old Austin Motor Company logo, will begin putting thousands of them into electric vehicles next year. According to Austin\u2019s chief executive, Danny Corcoran, the new technology is a \u2018game-changer\u2019.\n\n\u2018It can help trigger the next industrial revolution. The advantages over traditional electric vehicle batteries are enormous,\u2019 he said.\n\nFew will have heard of Jackson\u2019s extraordinary invention. The reason, he says, is that since he and his company Metalectrique Ltd came up with a prototype a decade ago, he has faced determined opposition from the automobile industry establishment.\n\nIt has every reason not to give ground to a competitor that may, in time, render its own technology obsolete. Car industry sceptics claim Trevor\u2019s technology is unproven, and its benefits exaggerated.\n\nBut an independent evaluation by the Government agency UK Trade and Investment said in 2017 that it was a \u2018very attractive battery\u2019 based on \u2018well established\u2019 technology, and that it produced much more energy per kilogram than standard electric vehicle types.\n\nGame-changer: the aluminium-air fuel cell stores far more energy than a conventional battery\n\nTwo years ago, Jackson claims, motor manufacturers lobbied the Foreign Office to bar him from a prestigious conference for European businesses and governments at the British embassy in Paris, which was supposed to agree a blueprint for ensuring all new cars are electric by 2040. The bid to exclude him failed. Now, with the signing of the Austin deal, it seems he is finally on the road to success.\n\nHe has also secured a \u00a3108,000 grant for further research from the Advanced Propulsion Centre, a partner of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. His technology has been validated by two French universities.\n\nHe says: \u2018It has been a tough battle but I\u2019m finally making progress. From every logical standpoint, this is the way to go.\u2019\n\nJackson began working on new ways of powering electric vehicles after a distinguished engineering career. He worked for Rolls-Royce in Derby, helping to design nuclear reactors, then took a commission in the Royal Navy, where he served as a lieutenant on board nuclear submarines, managing and maintaining their reactors.\n\nBefore founding his own firm in 1999, he was working for BAE Systems, where he first started looking at alternative, green ways to power vehicles. By then he and his partner, Kathryn, were married. The couple have eight children, aged 11 to 27, and live in Tavistock, on the edge of Dartmoor in Devon.\n\nIn 2001 he began to investigate the potential of a technology first developed in the 1960s. Scientists had discovered that by dipping aluminium into a chemical solution known as an electrolyte, they could trigger a reaction between the metal and air to produce electricity. At that time the method was useless for commercial batteries because the electrolyte was extremely poisonous, and caustic.\n\nAfter years of experimentation at his workshop in the Cornish village of Callington, Jackson\u2019s eureka moment came when he developed a new formula for the electrolyte that was neither poisonous nor caustic.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve drunk it when demonstrating it to investors, so I can attest to the fact that it\u2019s harmless,\u2019 Jackson says. Another problem with the 1960s version was that it worked only with totally pure aluminium, which is very expensive.\n\nBut Jackson\u2019s electrolyte works with much lower-purity metal \u2013 including recycled drinks cans. The formula, which is top secret, is the key to his device.\n\nTechnically, it should be described as a fuel cell, not a battery. Either way, it is so light and powerful that it could now be set to revolutionise low-carbon transport, because it supplies so much energy.\n\nJackson gave me a demonstration. He cut off the top of a can of Coke, drained it, filled it with the electrolyte, and clipped electrodes to it, powering a small propeller. \u2018The energy in this will keep the propeller spinning for a month,\u2019 he said. \u2018You can see what this technology could do in a vehicle if you scale it up.\u2019 Following last week\u2019s deal with Austin, that is exactly what is about to happen. Three immediate projects are about to go into production.\n\nThe first is to manufacture for the Asian market some \u2018tuk-tuks\u2019 \u2013 the three-wheeler taxis used by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last week during their Royal visit to Pakistan. The second is to make electric bikes, which will be cheaper and run for much longer than those made by rivals.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the firm is to produce kits to convert ordinary petrol and diesel cars into hybrids, by fitting them with aluminium-air cells and electric motors on the rear wheels.\n\nA driver will be able to choose whether to run the car on fossil fuel or electricity. The cost of each conversion, Jackson says, will be about \u00a33,500, and they will be available early next year. This, he adds, will be the stepping-stone to a full-blown electric vehicle powered by aluminium-air fuel cells. The car industry has already poured massive investment into a very different type of battery, lithium-ion.\n\nAlso found in devices such as computers and mobile phones, lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable. Almost every electric vehicle on the road uses them. But they have big drawbacks. As well as lithium, they contain rare, poisonous substances such as cobalt. They can explode or catch fire, as seen with the spate of incidents that forced Samsung to recall tens of thousands of Galaxy Note 7 phones in 2016.\n\nWith repeated charging, car-sized models eventually become spent. Recycling them to recover the cobalt and lithium is extremely expensive \u2013 about five times as much as the cost of disposing them and starting from scratch.\n\nAluminium, on the other hand, is the planet\u2019s most abundant metal. Many of the factories that refine it from ore or recycled junk are powered by green, renewable energy, such as hydro-electric dams.\n\nAnd once an aluminium-air fuel cell is spent, it can be recycled very cheaply. According to Jackson, the cost of recycling means the running costs of an aluminium-air powered car would work out at 7p per mile. The cost of a small hatchback\u2019s petrol comes to around 12p per mile. More important, lithium-ion batteries are heavy.\n\nAccredited tests have shown that, weight for weight, Jackson\u2019s fuel cell produces nine times as much energy as lithium-ion: nine times as many kilowatt hours of electricity per kilogram. The luxury electric car maker Tesla says its model S has a range of 370 miles from one charge. Jackson says that if you drove the same car with an aluminium-air cell that weighed the same as the lithium-ion battery, the range would be 2,700 miles. Aluminium-air cells also take up less space.\n\nJackson claims that if the Tesla were fitted with an aluminium-air fuel cell that was the same size as its current battery, it could run non-stop for 1,500 miles \u2013 almost enough to get from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats and back again. An average British family \u2013 whose car will travel 7,900 miles annually \u2013 would need to change their fuel cell only a handful of times each year.\n\nScientists call the weight-to- energy ratio \u2018energy density\u2019. According to Jackson, because aluminium-air fuel cells have a much greater density than lithium-ion batteries, they could be used in buses or big trucks. If powered by lithium-ion, such vehicles would be unfeasibly heavy, with the battery weighing as much as the freight.\n\nHe says: \u2018You could easily stack numerous cells in this type of vehicle \u2013 after all, getting rid of their diesel fuel tanks will give you plenty of space.\u2019 Jackson adds that aluminium-air cells could also be used in aircraft. \u2018We are in discussions with two aircraft manufacturers. It\u2019s not going to be suitable for jets. But it would work in propeller planes, and be suitable for short-haul passenger and cargo flights.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the raw cost of a new aluminium-air cell is much lower.\n\nIn a Tesla, Jackson says, the battery costs about \u00a330,000. An aluminium-air fuel cell that would power the same car for longer would cost just \u00a35,000.\n\nDrivers with cars that depend on lithium-ion have to charge their batteries from the mains when they are spent \u2013 a process that takes a long time, often overnight. But when an aluminium-air cell became exhausted, the driver would simply exchange it for a new one.\n\nInstead of a vast network of charging points, all that is necessary are stores where cells can be swapped, just as people already swap propane gas bottles.\n\nSwapping a battery, says Jackson, takes about 90 seconds.\n\nHe and Corcoran say they are in \u2018advanced discussions\u2019 with two major supermarket chains to provide this facility.\n\nLast week, Sir James Dyson announced he was scrapping his plans to make electric cars because he had come to the conclusion they were not commercially viable, even though he had invested millions.\n\n\u2018The problem is,\u2019 says Jackson, \u2018he was using lithium-ion. If his cars had been based on aluminium-air fuel cells, the outcome might have been different.\u2019\n\nIronically, Jackson\u2019s story so far bears more than a passing resemblance to Dyson\u2019s.\n\nDyson developed his bagless vacuum cleaner at a workshop at his home, supported by his wife.\n\nAnd just as Jackson has had to battle the vested interests of the big motor companies, it took Dyson ten years to break through commercially, because no distributor or existing manufacturer was prepared to upset the lucrative market for dust bags.\n\n\u2018Everyone knows that if we are really going to hit the Government\u2019s target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the hardest nut to crack is transport,\u2019 Jackson says. \u2018We\u2019re just not going to do that with lithium-ion. Apart from anything else, it\u2019s no use for trucks, which burn vast amounts of fossil fuel.\n\n\u2018I know we are battling ferocious vested interests but the technological and environmental advantages of aluminium-air are overwhelming \u2013 and Britain has a chance to become the world leader in it.\u2019\n\nCorcoran adds: \u2018If you want to do something about the environment, you can. You can do it now, with this product.\u2019", "description": "British engineer and former Royal Navy officer Trevor Jackson, signed a multi-million-pound deal to start manufacturing the battery on a large scale in the UK.", "authors": ["David Rose For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/00/19941226-0-image-a-67_1571528755679.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
