Rand Paul (R-KY) got into a heated discussion after Paul said Maduro was a socialist and that is why people in the country are suffering.\n\n\"Come on. Don\u2019t do that. Maduro is not a socialist. He\u2019s a corrupt, murderous thug who is starving his people,\" Navarro interjected.\n\nIn response to the video that was posted online, some Venezuelans said Navarro was dead wrong. Daniel Di Martino, who is a college student in the United States but was born and raised in Venezuela, said on Friday Navarro has \"no idea what she is talking about.\"\n\n\"Maduro is evil but starvation and death came because of his socialist policies,\" he added.\n\nVenezuela is the most socialist you can get out of North Korea. \u2014 Daniel Di Martino (@DanielDiMartino) October 11, 2019\n\nYou should know better @ananavarro. Maduro is evil but starvation and death came because of his socialist policies. To name a few of these policies: Government ownership of most industries, price and currency controls, and expanded welfare programs and government jobs. https://t.co/kzE4gszb8L \u2014 Daniel Di Martino (@DanielDiMartino) October 11, 2019\n\nConservative Venezuelan activists who were attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Brazil responded to Navarro in a video on Saturday.\n\n\"Let me tell you something Ana, Maduro is a die-hard socialist. He's so socialist because he steals private property, he destroys the economy, he kills everybody. Everybody's dying from hunger there. Everybody is dying from political persecution,\" said Rafael.\n\n.@RandPaul is right about Maduro's destructive socialism in Venezuela. @ananavarro should stop yelling and start standing with the Venezuelans who fight for freedom in their country. @TheView pic.twitter.com/R8HH1Wel1q \u2014 CPAC 2020 (@CPAC) October 12, 2019\n\nWhen Paul said it is not true that \"Maduro is not a socialist,\" Navarro interrupted and asked, \"That\u2019s not true? Maduro is not a thug and murderer who is starving his people? It\u2019s not socialism.\" Paul tried to explain he was referring to her comment about him not being a socialist, but Navarro accused him of trying to mansplain to her.", "description": ".10/14/2019 19:22:34PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/284/0bf1510a-1bbd-4e80-9a06-bd7dcffcd6b8.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
