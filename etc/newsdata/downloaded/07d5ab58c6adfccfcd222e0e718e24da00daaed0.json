Chile was a pressure cooker, and it exploded in the worst way,\u201d said a civil servant who gave her name only Maria, waiting to catch a bus amid the detritus of Friday\u2019s protests.\n\nSoldiers patrolled some parts of the city Saturday in their first such deployment since Chile returned to democracy in 1990 after the Augusto Pinochet rightwing dictatorship. But there was no sign of them outside the presidential palace.\n\nConservative President Sebastian Pinera called them out in the wee hours of the night after the worst violence the city has seen in years.\n\nThroughout Friday, rampaging protesters clashed with riot police in several parts of the capital, and the subway system was shut after attacks on stations. A total of 41 stations were destroyed, some completely charred.\n\nThe system was closed altogether on Saturday, and no one knows when it will reopen.\n\nThe Santiago Metro, at 140 kilometers (90 miles), is the largest and most modern in South America and a source of great pride for Chileans.\n\nThe general placed in charge of security, Javier Iturriaga, said some 500 soldiers are patrolling the streets. Things calmed down in Santiago, a city of seven million, overnight, he said.\n\n\u201cThis morning, the city is quiet,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 300 people were arrested, and 156 police were injured, as were 11 civilians.\n\nThe state of emergency is initially set for 15 days and restricts freedom of movement and assembly. Due to the emergency, the National Football Association has suspended matches this weekend.\n\n\u2013 Government \u2018perplexed and dazed\u2019 \u2013\n\nIturriaga said the military would patrol major trouble spots but would not impose a curfew at present.\n\nViolent clashes escalated as night fell, and the headquarters of the ENEL Chile power company and a Banco Chile branch \u2014 both in the city center \u2014 were set on fire.\n\nSeveral metro stations also hit with Molotov cocktails.\n\nThe ENEL tower blaze was put out with no one injured, firefighters said.\n\nBarricades were erected in several parts of the city, and masked protestors armed with sticks and stones clashed with riot police, who repelled them with water cannon and tear gas.\n\nResidents in many districts of Santiago banged their pots in a show of support for the protestors.\n\nThe unrest started as a fare-dodging protest mainly by students against the hike in metro ticket prices, which increased from 800 to 830 peso ($1.13 to $1.17) for peak-hour travel, following a 20 peso rise in January.\n\nThe fare hike was blamed on rising oil prices and a weaker peso.\n\nThere had been several fare-dodging actions in recent days, organized on social media, but the protests escalated Friday, tapping into general discontent among many Chileans.\n\nChile has the highest per capita income of Latin America at 20,000 dollars, with expected economic growth this year of 2.5 percent and just two percent inflation.\n\nBut there is an undercurrent of frustration with rising health care and utility costs, low pensions and social inequality.\n\nThe metro fare hike served to wake up a society that was averse to violence after the horrors of the Pinochet dictatorship from 1973-1990, which left more than 3,200 people dead or missing, sociologists say.\n\nHowever, tech-savvy younger Chileans, who did not live through that dark period, are leading the current protests.\n\n\u201cI think social media explains the coordination and synchronized nature of the actions that destroyed infrastructure yesterday,\u201d said Santiago Marcelo Mella, and analyst at the University of Santiago.\n\nHe said the government was \u201cperplexed and dazed\u201d by the eruption of violence, and this \u201cmust make us think about the quality of the intelligence services.\n\n\u201cOne gets the feeling that the government reacted too slowly,\u201d he said.", "description": "Santiago (AFP) \u2013 Residents of Chile\u2019s capital awoke Saturday to a ravaged city as burned-out buses, bikes and garbage littered the streets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/2bc63c_view-chilean-electric-company-enel-building-burned-mass-protests-on-18-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
