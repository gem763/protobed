Jody Hice (R-GA) and Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) that limits a president\u2019s post-office taxpayer-funded perks.\n\nThe House passed by voice vote Rep. Jody Hice\u2019s (R-GA) legislation, H.R. 1496, the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2019, Wednesday, sending the bill to the Senate.\n\nThe legislation would put limits on taxpayer-funded benefits for former U.S. presidents, which include their travel, personal staff, office space, and communications after they leave office. The bill would put a president\u2019s pension at $200,000 per year.\n\nRep. Hice said he was \u201cthrilled the House took an important step to reform this outdated pension and ensure responsible use of taxpayer money.\u201d\n\nThrilled the House took an important step to reform this outdated pension & ensure responsible, measured use of taxpayer money. I look forward to continuing to work with @SenJoniErnst to get this forward-thinking legislation across the finish line. More: https://t.co/jE6CeHY40K https://t.co/6D9cvBS4oO \u2014 Rep. Jody Hice (@CongressmanHice) October 17, 2019\n\nSen. Ernst, along with Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), sponsored the Senate version of the legislation in February.\n\nThe Iowa senator noted that former presidents receive generous speaking engagements, and even Netflix deals in the case of former President Barack Obama.\n\nFor instance, former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton made tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees since Bill left office, while former President Obama made a deal with Netflix in the \u201chigh-8\u201d dollar figures, as well as a joint book deal reportedly worth $65 million.\n\nSen. Ernst said that the American taxpayer should not need to keep funding former presidents\u2019 luxurious lifestyles.\n\nErnst said in a statement Thursday:\n\nFormer presidents rake in millions from speaking engagements, Netflix deals, and other big money windfalls once they leave office; but, believe it or not, taxpayers continue to foot the bills for the unlimited perks they still benefit from, like travel expenses and office space. That\u2019s simply ridiculous. My bipartisan bill would put a stop to these unlimited perks for future presidents, saving taxpayers millions.\n\nThe bill moves to the Senate, where it passed out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in May. Now that the legislation passed through the House, Republicans and Democrats could seize upon the momentum to pass it through the Senate and send it to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk to sign.\n\nSen. Ernst first sponsored the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act in 2015. The bill passed through both the House and Senate; however, then-President Obama vetoed the bill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled we have growing bipartisan and bicameral momentum behind my commonsense legislation, and I\u2019ll continue the push to get it signed into law,\u201d Ernst said.", "description": "The House passed a bill spearheaded by Jody Hice and Joni Ernst that limits a president's post-office taxpayer-funded perks.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/Joni-Ernst.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
