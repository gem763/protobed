Although Ireland currently top the world rankings, there\u2019s no doubt the side has blown hot and cold this year. A record defeat by England this summer set alarm bells ringing before a sense of normality was restored with back-to-back wins over Wales.\n\nAs for Scotland, the disappointment of their 2019 Six Nations was offset by that thrilling 38-38 draw against England in which Gregor Townsend\u2019s men showed that they possess the means to challenge the game\u2019s biggest and best sides.

BRB. And here they come, folks. Five minutes until kick-off! Schmidt gave this response when asked how the mood is in the camp right now: \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit anxious, a little bit quiet ... but they know the opportunity they have. We need to do the simple things really well.\u201d\n\nMaybe not what the fans wanted to hear, Joe. The teams are currently being read out and it's the Irish lot who drawing the biggest cheers from the crowd. There were A LOT of green shirts on view for the walk to the Nissan Stadium, many of which seemed to be worn by the locals. Advertisement Just under 15 minutes to go until kick-off! The players are out on the pitch going through their last-minute preparations as the stadium slowly fills up. It's looking pretty grey overhead with a slight breeze in the air. The players will be hoping it's stays like this, but with Typhoon Tapah currently making its way along the Japanese south coast we're expected to receive some of its peripheral effects. As mentioned earlier, Ireland are missing a lot in attack with both Keith Earls and Rob Kearney unavailable for today\u2019s clash. Andrew Conway and Jordan Larmour have stepped in as replacements, and will no doubt find themselves under pressure today as the Scots look to target their opponents for any potential weak spots.\n\nJacob Stockdale, who completes the back three alongside the pair, isn\u2019t worried, though. \"They are the kind of guys that are going to want to run onto the ball and attack which as a winger is very exciting,\u201d he said of his teammates.\n\n\"It hasn't really changed how we prepare, we prepare pretty much exactly the same as we would every other week for every other Test match.\" Oh! Just realised I walked past that Scottish trio on the way here to the stadium. They were singing something about the English being bastards (obviously). Time and a place, lads. Focus on today's enemy. *Generic fans-posing-for-the-camera pics incoming* Advertisement Scotland's Greig Laidlaw also threw his support behind skipper Stuart McIlally this week, backing the 29-year-old to enjoy a lengthy stint as captain of the Dark Blues. Scotland coach Gregor Townsend named McInally as his captain when announcing his 31-man squad for the World Cup, arguing the Edinburgh hooker had a calming influence which brought the best out of his teammates. \"He has been an excellent leader. He does his leadership on the field, he has the full backing of the team and we respect him,\" Laidlaw, who has led the national team a record 39 times, said. \"It is good to have a fresher voice, someone newer to the role. He is going to do a fantastic job, both now and for years to come. \"It is up to the leaders around him - myself included - to give him the support he needs.\"\n\nSo, what's been said ahead of today's match. Speaking on Saturday, Peter O'Mahony backed playmakers Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton to \"look after themselves\" against whatever strong-arm tactics Scotland might attempt.\n\nScotland have continually tried to unsettle Ireland's stellar British and Irish Lions playmaking duo over the years - and O'Mahony fully expects more of the same.\n\n\"Look, it hasn't come into our thinking. It's a Test game, half-backs are always targeted,\" O'Mahony said. \"So Johnny and the boys are well able to look after themselves.\" Some more stats and facts to set the scene. Gotta love 'em. - Ireland lost their only previous World Cup encounter with Scotland. On 12 October 1991, Scotland emerged victorious 24-15 at Murrayfield. - This will be the 136th test match between Ireland and Scotland, Ireland have won 63, Scotland 67 with five draws. Scotland have only faced England more often (137 times).\n\n- Since 1 January, 2000, these teams have met 24 times, with Ireland winning 18 of those and Scotland winning six. Five of those six Scotland victories took place at Murrayfield, and the other came at Croke Park.\n\n- On 9 February of this year, they met at Murrayfield in the Six Nations Championship, with the visitors winning 22-13.\n\n- Rory Best will be facing Scotland for the 15th time in test matches, equalling the Ireland record shared by Brian O'Driscoll and Ronan O'Gara. Ireland head into this game without the talents of Rob Kearney and Keith Earls. With 92 caps to his name, full-back Kearney brings a wealth of experience to this side as well as a calm head in those moments of pressure. Earls, meanwhile, has scored three tries in his last four games against Scotland. Both players will be sorely missed for today's clash. Advertisement As for Ireland, their recent record against Scotland will give them plenty of cause for optimism today. In Joe Schmidt's six games coaching Ireland against the Scots, he was won five, scoring 21 tries and conceding just nine. Nonetheless, the Irish will be hoping that the performance rolled out by the Scots in their 2017 victory at Murrayfield won't be repeated today. If it is, we should be in for a storming afternoon of rugby. History certainly isn't on Scotland's side for today's game. If the statistics are anything to go by, Gregor Townsend's men have it all to play for. Indeed, the Scots have won only five of their last 10 World Cup games. They haven't beaten a Tier One nation in the competition since defeating Italy a dozen years ago. And they haven't won a try count in this fixture since 2001. Gulp. Ireland winger Jacob Stockdale will miss having the experience of Keith Earls and Rob Kearney beside him in today's World Cup opener but is relishing the prospect of playing in a new look back three who love to attack.\n\nKearney and Earls, two of Ireland's most senior players, ran out of time to prove their fitness ahead of the with Scotland, opening the door for Leinster's Jordan Larmour at fullback and Munster's Andrew Conway on the wing.\n\nBoth are born runners and have scored some spectacular tries for their respective provinces, potentially handing Ireland's usually exact attacking game a more unpredictable edge.\n\n\"Obviously it's a loss to not have Rob and Earlsy in the back three with their experience but I think Andrew Conway and Jordan have played a lot of rugby with Ireland and I've played a lot with them,\" Stockdale said.\n\n\"They are both really exciting players to get to play with. They're the kind of guys that are going to want to run with the ball and attack which, as a winger, is really exciting.\" Hello all and welcome to The Independent's live coverage of this morning's Rugby World Cup clash between Ireland and Scotland.
