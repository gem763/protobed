Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe offering includes limited-time offers of 5% cash back on purchases using the card from Target, Sephora, Papa John's, and Chevron, and 4% back from Dunkin' and Sam's Club, and it will add new perks from retailers as the original ones expire, per a company blog post.\n\nRewards will be deposited into a consumer's Venmo account and can be used for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and purchases using the debit card or Venmo directly, or they can be transferred to a bank account or debit card. Cardholders can track the rewards they earn in their own personal feed and share them to their general feed.\n\nAdding rewards and giving users cash back with a number of potential uses could boost adoption and usage of Venmo's debit card. The number of Venmo cardholders hasn't been reported \u2014 the entire platform had 40 million users at the end of Q1 2019 \u2014 but PayPal has claimed that the product has seen strong interest from consumers, per TechCrunch.\n\nRegardless of its current popularity, adding rewards should make it more appealing since they provide additional value, and they could be particularly impactful since rewards are the most influential factor in card choice. Consumers might be especially interested in the cash-back opportunity since Venmo Rewards deposits it directly into consumers' general Venmo balance, potentially making it easy for users to transfer their earnings to a bank account or make a P2P payment, which is something many Venmo cardholders likely already do.\n\nVenmo Rewards could be key to PayPal's efforts to monetize Venmo, both with its debit card and its forthcoming credit card.\n\nBoosting usage of its debit card with rewards would help Venmo better monetize its business. Venmo offers a number of monetizable features, including its debit card, fee-based instant transfers, and Pay With Venmo, leading 35% of users to take monetizable actions as of Q3 2019, but it may still not be profitable. If Venmo card usage and adoption takes off because of Venmo Rewards, it should capture more revenue and raise its performance.\n\nVenmo can also use the response to its rewards program to inform the rewards it'll offer for its credit card when it launches in 2020. The credit card, which will be issued by Synchrony, could also bolster Venmo's monetization efforts if it proves popular. Venmo will need to ensure its card offers rewards that are appealing enough to attract consumers in a crowded marketplace, and Venmo Rewards' initial run could help it determine what perks will be most effective.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
