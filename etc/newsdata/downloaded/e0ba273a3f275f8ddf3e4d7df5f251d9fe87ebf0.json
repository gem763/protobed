I really didn\u2019t anticipate cellphones, camcorders and everything else.\u201d\n\nWednesday was already expected to be a particularly good day for Goodenough \u2013 he is to receive the prestigious Copley medal at the Royal Society in London in the evening.\n\nProf Mark Miodownik, a materials expert at University College London, said it was right that lithium-ion batteries were celebrated. \u201cThey are one of the most influential pieces of materials science that influence the modern life of everyone on the planet,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is remarkable too that although 30 years old, they have not been eclipsed by a better battery technology even now, which makes you realise what a remarkable discovery they are.\u201d\n\nBatteries work by turning chemical energy into electricity. A typical battery is made up of two electrodes, an anode and a cathode, which are usually separated by a liquid that can carry charged particles.\n\nBoth electrodes are connected to an electrical circuit. When the battery is powering an electrical device, electrons travel from the anode to the cathode through the electrical circuit, while positively charge ions move through the electrolyte. In a rechargeable battery, energy can be put into the device to reverse this process.\n\nWhile rechargeable batteries were around in the 1970s, they had drawbacks, not least in the amount of energy they could store. Lithium, it was thought, could be an answer since it is a very light metal and easily loses an electron. However, lithium\u2019s reactivity also made it tricky to harness.\n\nIn the 1970s Stanley Whittingham cracked the problem when looking to develop approaches for fossil-free energy in light of the oil crisis. His device, the first functional lithium battery, used lithium metal in the anode and lithium ions tucked into titanium disulphide for the cathode. Unfortunately, when this battery was repeatedly recharged, it ran the risk of exploding \u2013 a situation the local fire brigade were, apparently, none too pleased about. To improve safety, Whittingham combined metallic lithium with aluminium in the anode.\n\nGoodenough picked up the baton at the University of Oxford, and replaced the titanium disulphide in the cathode with cobalt oxide \u2013 an approach that doubled the voltage produced.\n\nYoshino used the cathode developed by Goodenough to create the first commercially-viable lithium-ion battery in 1985, with the anode in his battery composed of lithium ions and electrons housed within a carbon material called petroleum coke.\n\nThe upshot was a lightweight, compact battery that could be recharged many, many times \u2013 the bedrock of modern technology. The battery continues to be developed, not least to improve its environmental impact.\n\nProf Dame Carol Robinson, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said battery technology remains an exciting field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the journey, as lithium is a finite resource and many scientists around the world are building on the foundations laid by these three brilliant chemists,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Monday, William Kaelin, Sir Peter Ratcliffe and Gregg Semenza won the 2019 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their work on understanding how cells adapt to low levels of oxygen, and on Tuesday the physics prize was shared between James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz for their work on cosmology and the discovery of the first exoplanet.\n\nTwo literature awards will be announced on Thursday after last year\u2019s prize was postponed, the peace prize winner will be announced on Friday, followed by economics on Monday.", "description": "John B Goodenough, M Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino honoured for development that sparked portable technology revolution", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/562affa359cbe92872816437365299dbf1802002/26_94_741_445/master/741.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3bb97042a5555240e52ae638fd24f1cb", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
