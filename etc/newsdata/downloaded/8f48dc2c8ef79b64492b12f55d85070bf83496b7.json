Last year it signed a preliminary agreement to use half of the Padur reserve.\n\nAhuja said Aramco would have to keep some of the 4.6 million barrels for India's strategic needs, but could sell the rest to Indian refiners.\n\nIndia, which relies on imports for about 80 percent of its oil needs, has underground emergency storage in three locations to protect against any supply disruption. The reserves can hold 36.87 million barrels.", "description": "Global oil producers are eager to gain a foothold in India, where fuel demand is expected to keep rising.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/30/d8336fa2c63e4a4e8691c73273564837_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
