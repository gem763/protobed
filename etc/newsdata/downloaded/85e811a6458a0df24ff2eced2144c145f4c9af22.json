USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 It\u2019s not often a rookie pitcher with almost no postseason experience steps into the October spotlight and has the game of his life. But that\u2019s exactly what Houston Astros right-hander Jos\u00e9 Urquidy did.\n\nTrailing two games to one, the Astros pinned their World Series hopes on the right arm of a 24-year-old from Mexico on Saturday night. And he responded like a seasoned veteran.\n\n\u201cThe man took the ball tonight and put on a great performance. I feel like it was the best performance from an Astro this year in the World Series,\u201d Correa said. \u201cHe exceeded every expectation, he gave us a huge chance to win the game. He was perfect.\u201d\n\nOnly the third native of Mexico to ever start a World Series game, Urquidy admitted he was a little nervous when he got the official word he\u2019d be starting Game 4.\n\nAstros rookie pitcher Jose Urquidy tossed five scoreless innings.

After a single by Anthony Rendon, Juan Soto lined the next pitch into the glove of third baseman Alex Bregman for the third out.\n\nThat scoreless first inning was followed by another and another as Urquidy allowed only two hits in five shutout frames.\n\nJos\u00e9 Urquidy is just the fourth rookie in the last 30 years to throw a scoreless start in the World Series. pic.twitter.com/FZO2eWqLeo \u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just fearless. His stuff was electric tonight and he was so much fun to watch,\u201d said Astros reliever Brad Peacock. \u201cHe was just attacking everybody with all his pitches, throwing strikes with all his pitches. That\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen him this year.\u201d\n\nWhen the Astros offense exploded and the rest of the bullpen finished off an 8-1 victory, Urquidy joined the great Fernando Valenzuela to become only the second Mexican pitcher to earn a World Series win.\n\n\u201cThat means a lot to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is now history, right? I feel very special for that.\u201d\n\nWhat was also special is that he was able to share the moment with his mother, Alma. The two talk a lot during the season and she was able to make the trip to Washington to see her son on the game\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nThe two had coffee earlier in the day, and she was able to share some final words of encouragement. But even with all the attention from his home country, his family and Astros fans back in Houston, Urquidy reacted on the mound just the way he is in the clubhouse.\n\nIn Peacock\u2019s words: \u201cChill.\u201d\n\nThat was exactly what the Astros needed as they tried to stay calm and focused on their goal of evening the series.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a quiet kid. He doesn\u2019t talk a lot,\u201d said catcher Robinson Chirinos. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to go out there when your team\u2019s 2-1 down and give a chance to win a game. But I think his personality \u2013the way he is \u2013 allows him to perform on this kind of stage.\u201d\n\nDropping in a variety of sliders and changeups, then mixing them with a fastball that topped out at 96 mph, Urquidy flustered the Nationals hitters by pitching backwards.\n\n\u201cHe went against his percentages, which was smart,\u201d Nationals right fielder Adam Eaton said as Urquidy ditched the changeup he usually throws to lefties in favor of his slider.\n\n\u201cWhen you go in with a game plan working off the scouting report and he goes the complete opposite with it, by the time you make the adjustments it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nSPECIAL DELIVERY: Bregman delivers grand slam in Game 4 win\n\nDECISIONS: Nats manager on bullpen: 'You don't chase wins'\n\nIt\u2019s been quite a year for Urquidy, who missed the entire 2017 season recovering from elbow surgery and, until this spring, had never pitched above Class A.\n\nA good, but not elite prospect, Urquidy was the opening day starter at Class AA Corpus Chiristi. He rose through the minors not only on the strength of his ability to make hitters swing and miss, but also on his excellent control.\n\nHe made his debut in early July when the Astros needed a spot starter due to injuries. The five starts he did make weren\u2019t terribly impressive, but he did show enough promise with 24 strikeouts and only four walks in 23 innings.\n\nAfter going back to the minors, Urquidy rejoined the team as a September call-up \u2013 with markedly better results. In 18 innings over four appearances down the stretch, he pitched to a 1.50 ERA with 16 strikeouts and three walks. That was good enough to earn a spot on the Astros\u2019 postseason roster.\n\n\u201cHe's evolved to being a very, very confident, very calm, very poised pitcher. And I noticed that during the Division Series in Tampa,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cWe asked him to do something he had rarely done; come out of the bullpen, middle of an inning, kind of the high stakes of postseason baseball, and he was up for the challenge.\u201d\n\nDespite pitching just 4 \u2153 innings in the Astros\u2019 first two playoff series, he got the call from Hinch to start Game 4 because his manager liked his \u201cdemeanor\u201d and his \u201capproach.\u201d\n\nThat decision was validated Saturday night when he outpitched the Nationals\u2019 starter, $140 million free-agent signee Patrick Corbin.\n\n\u201cEverything for him was working tonight. His fastball. Changeup was unbelievable,\u201d catcher Robinson Chirinos said. \u201cHis slider got so much better the last four weeks. That was the pitch he was struggling to when he was with us in July ... What a day for him.\u201d\n\nThanks in part to Urquidy\u2019s efforts, the Astros may have taken back control of the World Series. Even though the teams are tied 2-2, the Astros have aces Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander on the mound for Games 5 and 6.\n\nBut for now, the night belonged to a 24-year-old rookie from Mexico.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know who he was,\u201d Hinch said, \u201cI think this stage will make sure everybody knows who he is now.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s not often a rookie with almost no postseason experience steps into the spotlight and has the game of his life.
