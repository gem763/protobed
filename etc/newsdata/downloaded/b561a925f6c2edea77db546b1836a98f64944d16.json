It\u2019s based on an Indiana tour that Deb Fallows and I made this spring, co-organized by New America Indianapolis and Indiana Humanities.\n\nInstallment No. 1 was about an innovative, inclusive job-training program called Build Your Future. This one is about the topic on which Deb and I have most changed our minds\u2014or, really, had our eyes opened\u2014during our travels over the past few years.\n\nThat topic is the role of public arts, \u201cplace making,\u201d cultural festivals, and other arts-based means of generating civic connections and promoting economic development.\n\nHalf a dozen years ago, before we began these city-by-city travels, if you\u2019d asked me about \u201cthe role of the arts,\u201d I would have said something like: \u201cYeah, sure, arts are great! Everyone should like art [etc.].\u201d Now we have a vivid place-by-place sense of the difference that ambitious public-arts programs can have. For instance:\n\nThe film below is about one of Indianapolis\u2019s (many) answers to the question of how arts can renew a community.\n\nThe video focuses on the Big Car Collaborative, which is a multibuilding art space and civic-engagement organization in Indianapolis. Among its events are its First Friday gatherings and art tours. Check out the video for more.\n\nThanks to the videographer and editor Michael Jensen, the executive producer Fuzz Hogan, plus our other friends at New America.", "description": "", "authors": ["James Fallows"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/notes/2019/10/Kids/facebook.png?1570035652"}
