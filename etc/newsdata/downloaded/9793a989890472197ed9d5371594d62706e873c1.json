There\u2019s plenty that\u2019s going on right now with regards to the Ukrainian involvement in a variety of aspects,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), told The Daily Beast. \u201cMr. Giuliani going there, I don\u2019t know if that actually will speed up any investigation that has already started.\u2026 I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s being helpful or hurtful. The investigation is going to go on at a pace that does not take into account his travel to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe comments from Meadows represented a soft rebuke of the president\u2019s lawyer. But it was a rebuke nonetheless, made all the more notable considering that the congressman counts himself among the top backers of the administration.\n\nOther congressional Republicans took a different approach to news that Giuliani was planning to travel to Ukraine in hopes of unearthing information on the origins of the Mueller probe and the involvement of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, with an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. Instead of weighing in on the efficacy of the president\u2019s lawyer asking a foreign country for dirt on his potential opponent, they insisted they\u2019d missed the story entirely.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), another Trump booster, told The Daily Beast he had not read the New York Times report on Giuliani, though he had read another Times story\u2014last week\u2019s report that the FBI sent an investigator posing as a private citizen to meet with Trump campaign officials during the 2016 race.\n\nRep. Will Hurd (R-TX), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he too had not seen the Giuliani story and referred The Daily Beast to his office. As of press time, Hurd\u2019s office did not say if he had since caught the story, or offered comment on it.\n\nAccording to the Times, Giuliani is making the trip to Ukraine in hopes of persuading the country\u2019s incoming president to keep pursuing investigations opened by the previous administration and to gather intel on whether Joe Biden tried to push for the ouster of a prosecutor looking into the company on whose board Hunter Biden served. Bloomberg has reported that the timeline of the events\u2014and official documents pertaining to it\u2014undercut the idea that the former VP intervened on his son\u2019s behalf.\n\nGiuliani was upfront about the motivations for his trip and event acknowledged that it could be seen as ethically dubious.\n\n\u201cSomebody could say it\u2019s improper,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cI\u2019m asking them to do an investigation that they\u2019re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I\u2019m going to give them reasons why they shouldn\u2019t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.\u201d\n\nWhile few Republicans were willing to question Giuliani\u2019s decision to go to Ukraine, Democrats exhibited no such reservations. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) said at an Axios event on Friday morning that the news \u201cjust takes your breath away.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine in an ordinary world, the lawyer of the president going to a foreign power and trying to encourage them to investigate the family of a political opponent,\u201d said Schiff. \u201cHe said some people might think it's improper. Arguably everyone thinks it's improper. But that's not stopping them.\u201d", "description": "Mark Meadows expressed his doubts about the president\u2019s lawyer needing to go to a foreign country to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1557517357/190510-brodey-trump-rudys-tease_vztwjw", "published_at": "2019-05-10"}
