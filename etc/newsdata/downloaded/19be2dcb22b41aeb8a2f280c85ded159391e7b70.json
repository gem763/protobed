Hope Cronin told Warrior Maven earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe updated weapon will include improved safety, security and reliability,\u201d Cronin said.\n\nThe B61-12 adds substantial new levels of precision targeting and consolidates several different kinds of attack options into a single weapon. Instead of needing separate variants of the weapon for different functions, the B61-12 by itself allows for earth-penetrating attacks, low-yield strikes, high-yield attacks, above surface detonation and bunker-buster options.\n\nThe latest version of the B61 thermonuclear gravity bomb, which has origins as far back as the 1960s, is engineered as a low-to-medium yield strategic and tactical nuclear weapon, according to nuclearweaponsarchive.org, which also states the weapon has a \u201ctwo-stage\u201d radiation implosion design.\n\n\u201cThe main advantage of the B61-12 is that it packs all the gravity bomb capabilities against all the targeting scenarios into one bomb. That spans from very low-yield tactical \u201cclean\u201d use with low fallout to more dirty attacks against underground targets,\u201d Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project, Federation of American Scientists, told Warrior Maven.\n\nAir Force officials describe this, in part, by referring to the upgraded B61-12 as having an \u201cAll Up Round.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe flight test accomplished dedicated B61-12 developmental test requirements and \u201cAll Up Round\u201d system level integration testing on the B-2,\u201d Cronin said.\n\nThe B61 Mod 12 is engineered with a special \u201cTail Subassembly\u201d to give the bomb increased accuracy, giving a new level of precision targeting using Inertial Navigation Systems, Kristensen said.\n\n\u201cRight now the B-2 carries only B61-7 (10-360 kt), B61-11(400 kt, earth-penetrator), and B83-1 (high-yield bunker-buster). The B61-12 covers all of those missions, with less radioactive fallout, plus very low-yield attacks,\u201d he added.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Thank god it was not live, but the point is clear: the nuclear age is not over.", "authors": ["Kris Osborn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KGh1hVx7AS4dT8CEvw76Pg--~B/aD05NDE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/b21d23df6f8a428c5e0bd515e7fbf23a", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
