The researchers explained that this might be due to only a small number of studies investigating this aspect, or because major depressive disorder is a chronic disease which requires long-term treatment and \"it is difficult to obtain improvement in quality of life measures in several weeks.\"\n\nNo major side effects were observed from taking anti-inflammatory agents, although those who took statins and NACs did experience some gut symptoms. The team added that as most trials lasted only four to 12 weeks, it was not possible to track possible long-term side effects.\n\nAlthough they note that more research is needed, the team concluded, \"The results of this systematic review suggest that anti-inflammatory agents play an antidepressant role in patients with major depressive disorder and are reasonably safe.\"", "description": "New Chinese research has found that taking anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin, paracetamol, statins and antibiotics could help to reduce the symptoms of major depression.
