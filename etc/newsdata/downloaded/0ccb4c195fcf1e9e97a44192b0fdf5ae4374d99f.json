Tlaib to committee witness: \u2018Why were you winking at one of my colleagues\u2026?\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "A House Oversight subcommittee held a hearing on vaping today. Republicans invited a witness named Vicki Porter who testified that vaping had helped her quit smoking after many years of trying and failing:\n\nPorter shared that switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes nine years ago likely saved her life. \u201cQuitting smoking is very, very, very hard. Nobody tells you that. \u2026 Vaping is a health miracle to me because without it I would probably be on my way to a lung cancer diagnosis,\u201d Porter told members of Congress. She said flavors are important to keep adult smokers using e-cigarettes instead of backsliding to tobacco. She said she has never been healthier since switching to e-cigarettes.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib decided to question Porter but the questioning quickly turned odd. \u201cMs. Porter, I was reading because I want to know more about you and your beliefs, and I respect that we all have different beliefs, but you call yourself a converted conservative and reformed Marxist. Are you a conspiracy theorist?\u201d Tlaib asked.\n\n\u201cI think my politics are entirely irrelevant to this hearing,\u201d Porter replied.\n\n\u201cOh, okay. Why were you winking at one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle? You winked,\u201d Tlaib said.\n\n\u201cBecause I know Glenn Grothman,\u201d Porter replied, referring to the Republican congressman from Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s what it\u2026So the winking\u2026Did he\u2026\u201d Tlaib fumbled.\n\n\u201cHe introduced me. He\u2019s a friend of mine,\u201d Porter clarified.\n\n\u201cOkay, understand,\u201d Tlaib replied. She continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what the winking was. Cause I thought maybe there was something, like a conspiracy thing going on there. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think there\u2019s a conspiracy in this hearing ma\u2019am?\u201d Porter asked.\n\n\u201cNo, no. I actually think people are speaking truth here\u2026\u201d Tlaib said.\n\n\u201cMay I address the truth?\u201d Porter asked.\n\n\u201cWell the truth for you is very different from the majority of people in this room who do believe that children are being targeted by vaping,\u201d Tlaib said.\n\nPorter replied, \u201cThe truth for me is I quit smoking with these cigarettes and so did 8 million other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still smoking, ma\u2019am. You\u2019re still smoking,\u201d Tlaib said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not smoking and I\u2019m not lying under oath,\u201d Porter said.\n\nHere\u2019s the full, weird exchange. I guess Tlaib was trying to make Porter look bad but her effort backfired. Tlaib herself looks unprofessional and a bit unhinged, albeit not for the first time in her brief career:", "description": "\"I thought maybe there was...a conspiracy thing going on...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tlaib-winking.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
