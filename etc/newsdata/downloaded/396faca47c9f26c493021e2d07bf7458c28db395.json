Matrafailo III was fired in May from the Fayetteville Police Department, according to his dismissal letter, a copy of which was obtained by TIME.\n\nThe letter notes that the police department received a complaint in March accusing Matrafailo of reaching out to a sexual assault victim on Instagram and starting a conversation that she later said felt inappropriate. He is alleged to have made a second attempt to contact the woman a few days later.\n\nMatrafailo handled the woman\u2019s sexual assault case in September 2016, the letter says.\n\n\u201cAlthough detectives sometimes follow up with victims, you had not spoken with this victim since shortly after her trial and she had never provided you with her social media contact information,\u201d police chief Gina V. Hawkins wrote in the letter.\n\nFollowing an investigation into his actions, Matrafailo was fired. Cumberland County District Attorney William West tells TIME there are no current charges against Matrafailo. The case is under investigation by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, he says. The agency could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nMatrafailo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He told the Fayetteville Observer, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say regarding that,\u201d when reached for comment about the matter.\n\nErin Scanlon tells TIME she met Matrafailo in Sept. 2016 when he became the investigator in her rape case. The case ended in a trial in June 2018, with her perpetrator acquitted. In March 2019, she says she got a message from an unknown person on Instagram.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s me, Matrafailo from FPD,'\u201d she says. \u201cHe kept messaging, like \u2018How are you?\u2019 I would just answer politely. I didn\u2019t ask him any questions.\u201d\n\nThen, she says, Matrafailo asked her about her Amazon wishlist, and commented on \u201csome interesting things on there,\u201d and adding things like winky faces and emojis with the tongue sticking out.\n\n\u201cIt was very gross,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was when I realized he was making it sexual, and I was not about that.\u201d\n\nWhile the dismissal letter mentions one victim toward whom Matrafailo is accused of making inappropriate comments and advances, at least two other women have come forward with similar stories about his conduct. Deanne Gerdes, executive director of the Rape Crisis Volunteers of Cumberland County, tells TIME a total of three alleged victims of sexual assault, including Scanlon, told her that the former detective, who handled their cases, had sent them inappropriate messages on social media.\n\n\u201cAll three of them had the same thought process when they started receiving the messages. They were shocked and questioning themselves, like, \u2018Am I reading this right?\u2019 \u2018Is he saying what I think he\u2019s saying?'\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be boundaries for him.\u201d\n\nGerdes says Matrafailo\u2019s conduct was particularly shocking because she\u2019s worked with Fayetteville police on a daily basis in the 11 years she\u2019s served as director of the rape crisis volunteer group. She had previously worked with Matrafailo, she says.\n\n\u201cWe all worked very well together. They have led a very victim centered approach in our community,\u201d she says. \u201cIf that group of people couldn\u2019t see the red flags, I don\u2019t know that there is a perfect solution for this to not happen again.\u201d\n\nScanlon says Matrafailo betrayed her trust after getting to know her from the time he spent working on her rape case.\n\n\u201cIt was really disappointing to be sexualized by someone who you\u2019re supposed to be able to trust,\u201d she says. \u201cHe knew everything about me at that point in my life.\u201d", "description": "Paul G.
