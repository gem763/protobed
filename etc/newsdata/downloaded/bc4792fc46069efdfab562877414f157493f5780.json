But the report\u2019s authors, Roland Rajah, Alexandre Dayant and Jonathan Pryke, argue China\u2019s global infrastructure plan presents a more \u201cnuanced picture\u201d than the accusation of \u2018debt-trap diplomacy\u2019 and sovereign risk to small nations unable to service their debts.\n\nPapua New Guinea asks China to refinance its national debt as Beijing influence grows Read more\n\n\u201cThe evidence suggests China has not been engaged in problematic debt practices in the Pacific as to justify accusations of debt trap diplomacy, at least not to date. Still, the sheer scale of Chinese lending and the lack of strong institutional mechanisms to protect the debt sustainability of borrowing countries mean a continuation of business as usual would pose clear risks.\n\n\u201cChina will need to substantially restructure its approach if it wants to remain a major player in the Pacific without fulfilling the debt trap accusations of its critics.\u201d\n\n\u201cDebt-trap diplomacy\u201d, broadly defined, is where a creditor country intentionally lends excessive credit to a smaller debtor country, with the intention of extracting economic or political concessions when the smaller country cannot service the loan.\n\nBecause of small populations, fragile economies prone to external shocks (like oil price hikes) or uncontrollable events such as natural disasters, and weak institutions of government, Pacific states are acutely vulnerable to debts becoming unsustainable. Economic growth in Pacific states is \u201cmore volatile than it is fast\u201d, and that unpredictably can make repaying large loans unsustainable, the Lowy report says.\n\nChina\u2019s massively increased aid and development presence in the Pacific is made starkly apparent by its contrasting style to traditional aid donors in the region, such as Australia.\n\nChina has backed infrastructure development \u2013 usually large, landmark constructions such as bridges or significant public buildings \u2013 and usually through loans rather than through grants.\n\n\u201cChinese assistance is perceived to be faster, more responsive to the needs of local political elites, and have fewer conditions attached,\u201d the Lowy report says. \u201cAs one senior Pacific bureaucrat put it: \u2018we like China because they bring the red flags, not the red tape\u2019.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s development presence was acutely apparent when the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, visited Fiji last week. In order to meet with the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, Morrison\u2019s motorcade had to drive over the Fiji-China friendship bridge, and past the construction site of a Chinese-financed 30-storey tower, soon to be the tallest building in the Pacific islands.\n\nBut the nature and quality of Chinese infrastructure projects have been criticised.\n\nThe former international development minister, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, accused Beijing of \u201cduchessing\u201d the Pacific, building \u201cwhite elephant\u201d infrastructure, \u201croads to nowhere\u201d and \u201cuseless buildings\u201d.\n\n\u201cTied financing, little due diligence, outsized projects, weak project oversight, and fraudulent and corrupt practices are among the many criticisms that have been directed at Chinese projects,\u201d the Lowy report said.\n\nBut a 2014 study analysing the impact and quality of Chinese projects in the Pacific found some performed far better than others.\n\n\u201cThe evidence suggests that, if left alone, Chinese state firms will cut corners and inflate prices. If managed properly, they can deliver good quality infrastructure,\u201d the Lowy report says.\n\nThe case of Hambantota port in Sri Lanka is held up as an exemplar of a \u201cdebt-trap\u201d diplomacy.\n\nAfter China\u2019s Export Import Bank financed, and Chinese companies built, a new inland port in Hambantota \u2013 the home district of the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who greenlit the port, and after whom it is named \u2013 the Sri Lankan government ran into debt-related problems and a debt-for-equity swap was proposed, giving a state-owned Chinese firm a majority equity stake in the strategically located port from 2017.\n\nSimilarly, Tonga, a country of 100,000 people, still owes China\u2019s Exim Bank $108m \u2013 about 25% of Tonga\u2019s GDP \u2013 for loans taken out in 2008 and 2010 and since deferred twice.\n\nIn 2018, the then Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said Australia wanted to ensure Pacific states were not \u201ctrapped into unsustainable debt outcomes\u201d by Chinese loans. \u201cThe trap can then be a debt-for-equity swap and they have lost their sovereignty.\u201d\n\nAnd in August this year, the US Defence Secretary, Mark Esper, accused China of destabilising the region through \u201cpredatory economics and debt-for-sovereignty deals\u201d.\n\nChina has fiercely rejected the accusations.\n\n\u201cRather than pointing fingers at China\u2019s good deeds, those who keep on making groundless accusations and speculations might as well do more themselves to provide help to the Pacific island countries,\u201d Beijing\u2019s ambassador to Samoa, Chao Xiaoliang, wrote in the Samoa Observer.\n\nWhat is China's Belt and Road Initiative? Read more\n\n\u201cSome people questioned the purpose of China\u2019s aid, even disregarded the facts and fabricated the so-called \u2018China debt trap\u2019 \u2013 this is either out of prejudice or ignorance of China\u2019s foreign aid policy.\u201d\n\nThe Lowy paper argues that in order to avoid its Pacific infrastructure projects becoming debt traps for small nations, China should reform its lending practices to be closer to those of the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, \u201cthe standard-bearers for international good practice\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf China wants to remain a major development financier in the Pacific without fulfilling the debt trap accusations of its critics, it will need to substantially restructure its approach, including adopting formal lending rules similar to those of the multilateral development banks.\u201d\n\nDespite a significantly decreased aid budget \u2013 currently a historic low 0.21% of GNI \u2013 Australia remains the dominant aid provider to the region. But, as part of the Pacific Step-Up it announced in November 2018, Australia is seeking to move more into providing loans, alongside aid grants, with the $2bn Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) \u2013 $1.5bn in loans, $0.5bn in grants \u2013 as well as another $1bn in callable capital for Export Finance Australia (EFA).\n\nThe Lowy paper warns against an infrastructure \u2018arms race\u2019 with China in the Pacific, arguing it could worsen the risk of debt traps for island nations.\n\n\u201cThere are concerns that in seeking to compete directly with loans from China, Australia might simply exacerbate existing debt sustainability problems in the Pacific.\u201d", "description": "Lowy Institute warns Australia an infrastructure \u2018arms race\u2019 could exacerbate debt sustainability problems", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adafcd7935e4014a65c97735a8adc7422973ad6c/0_249_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0755b66a5707af00cbe6b538c3a3d6d3", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
