Still inside - more details to come,\" tweeted congressman Matt Gaetz, a fierce Trump defender.\n\n- Complaint filed -\n\nThe House Homeland Security Committee chairman, Bennie Thompson, wrote the sergeant at arms complaining that lawmakers blatantly breached security by \"intentionally\" bringing their electronic devices into the SCIF.\n\n\"As such I am requesting you take action with respect to the members involved in the breach,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nThe sit-in delayed the deposition of Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense responsible for Ukraine policy, for several hours.\n\nCooper began testifying later in the afternoon, a staffer told AFP, and that evening Schiff tweeted she \"did her lawful duty and answered questions from both parties.\"\n\n\"She did so notwithstanding efforts by the President to stop her, and when those failed, efforts by his GOP allies in Congress to do the same,\" he wrote.\n\nSteve Scalise, the number two House Republican who joined the protest, said lawmakers were being denied access as Democrats were \"trying to impeach the president of the United States with a one-sided set of rules.\"\n\nAll members of the three House committees conducting the investigation, including more than 40 House Republicans -- among them Vice President Mike Pence's brother, congressman Greg Pence -- are permitted to attend the depositions and question witnesses.\n\nSeveral of those with full access to the hearing joined other Republicans in the protest, arguing that the impeachment process deserves more transparency.\n\n- 'Freaked out' -\n\nRepublicans opposed to the impeachment process have settled on the new strategy of attacking the process itself, claiming it is invalid because the House has not taken a floor vote to launch an impeachment inquiry, and that it lacks transparency.\n\nTaylor delivered a withering deposition Tuesday that some Democrats have described as the most damning testimony yet.\n\nNumber two Senate Republican John Thune acknowledged that the picture painted by the envoy according to reports was \"not a good one.\"\n\nIn a 15-page opening statement to lawmakers, Taylor provided extensive details of how Trump sought to withhold US military aid to exert pressure on his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to launch an investigation of his political rival Joe Biden and his son.\n\nTaylor said in his statement that the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told him that \"'everything' was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance.\"\n\n\"Bill Taylor gave a devastating opening statement yesterday, they're freaked out, (and) they're trying to stop this investigation,\" Democratic congressman Ted Lieu told reporters.", "description": "Furious about being left out of the Donald Trump impeachment process, US congressional Republicans stormed a closed-door witness deposition and refused to leave for several hours in an escalation of the showdown over the investigation of the president.
