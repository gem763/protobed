Sendeniz was ousted from her job at the Igdir University for signing the petition.\n\nCalling themselves \u201cAcademics for Peace,\u201d the 1,128 initial signatories of the letter published in January 2016 included Turkish scholars and prominent overseas academics such as American linguist Noam Chomsky.\n\nThey said Turkey was condemning residents of towns in the southeast to hunger through the use of curfews, and also called for a solution to the conflict that included talks with the Kurdish political movement.\n\nAfter the ceasefire ended in 2015, the Turkish government had put large parts of the southeast under curfew and some largely Kurdish areas were bombarded by heavy weapons.\n\nThe government says its measures were necessary to root out Kurdish militants who had dug trenches and laid explosives. The United Nations has estimated the security operations left 2,000 people dead and up to half a million displaced.\n\nThe PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency against the state since the 1980s that has killed more than 40,000 people.\n\nA total of 785 signatories were put on trial in separate cases and more than 200 had been sentenced so far, according to Academics for Peace.", "description": "A Turkish court for the first time ruled on Friday to acquit one of nine academics who were charged with \"propaganda of a terrorist organization\" for signing a 2016 letter calling for the end of a conflict in the country's southeast.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
