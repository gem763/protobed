Smith is not leaving to take another job in journalism, he said during his final broadcast.\n\nIn addition to working as chief news anchor, Smith had been managing editor of the network's breaking news unit. He had worked at Fox News since its launch.\n\nAt a network known for its often full-throated support of President Donald Trump, Smith stood out for his criticisms of the president and for his fact-checking of claims by Trump and his supporters.\n\n\"Is he leaving? Oh, that's a shame,\" Trump quipped to reporters on the heels of the announcement of Smith's exit.\n\nSmith's departure follows a report that he was warned last month by Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and network president Jay Wallace not to criticize the network's evening anchor Tucker Carlson again.\n\nSmith had said on the air that it was \"repugnant\" that Carlson had not spoken up in defense of Fox News contributor Andrew Napolitano after a Carlson guest, attorney Joseph di Genova, called Napolitano a \"fool\" for saying that Trump had broken the law. Di Genova is a legal advisor to Trump.\n\nSmith also has been criticized repeatedly by Trump \u2014 as recently as Thursday \u2014 after not lavishing praise on the president, as a number of other hosts on the network routinely do.\n\n\"Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News and begin a new chapter,\" Smith said in a prepared statement.\n\n\"After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many,\" Smith said.", "description": "Shepard Smith's afternoon show on Friday was his last appearance on Fox News.
