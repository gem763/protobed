The display left football fans drooling and calling on their favorite teams to give her a shot in the NFL. In a recent appearance on ESPN's \"Laughter Permitted\" podcast, Lloyd revealed that she's seriously \"entertaining\" the idea of doing just that.\n\n\"I want to try it,\" Lloyd told former USWNT player Julie Foudy, who hosts the podcast. \"I want to put a helmet on, and I want to put pads on, but first and foremost, I want to play soccer for as long as I can.\"\n\nLloyd said she has a history of hitting chip shots on the gridiron. She first gave it a try after the 2015 World Cup when she was on \"Hard Knocks\" with the Houston Texans. She kicked against then-Texans nose tackle Vince Wilfork and managed to knock in some easy field goals from 35 yards out.\n\nRead more: USWNT captain Carli Lloyd said the 2019 World Cup was 'absolutely the worst time of my life'\n\nShe upped the ante when the USWNT took a trip to Dallas for training, hitting some 45- and 50-yard kicks through the uprights with relative ease. Then she hit her stride in front of the Eagles, her favorite NFL team.\n\n\"I just started hitting them. I didn't warm up, just went for it,\" Lloyd said. \"Started at 25 and kept moving back. It was in the narrow uprights, so it was nine feet wide. So I actually hit a 57-yarder, but it only would've hit in a real 18-foot upright.\"\n\nCarli Lloyd celebrates at the 2019 World Cup.

Shortly after her big boot briefly took over the world of American football, Lloyd revealed that some teams had contacted her with real interest. She was even invited to join a few rosters for the final preseason game of the year, a detail she elaborated on during her interview with Foudy.\n\n\"Two teams wanted me to play in a preseason game,\" Lloyd said. \"But we [the USWNT] had a game in Philly that same night.\"\n\nLloyd said she thinks she received \"more media coverage\" after her big day in Philadelphia than she has in her entire soccer career and joked that \"at least I have a plan B,\" but she seemed sincere when she told Foudy that she would consider a second life as an NFL placekicker after her illustrious USWNT and National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) careers come to a close.\n\n\"Why not?\" she said. \"There's a first for everything, right?\"", "description": "\"I want to try it,\" Carli Lloyd said on ESPN's \"Laughter Permitted\" podcast. \"I want to put a helmet on and I want to put pads on.\"", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da75f92cc4a0a19574a3684?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
