And honestly, I don\u2019t have the answers for you.\n\nYep, instead of dealing with important issues like the deportation of the Tamil family, Peter Dutton has decided to star in a fucking rap video. A man with priorities, I like it.\n\nThis is the first time the Home Affairs Minister has shown any interest in DMX, an American rapper who has a string of charges and jail stints for everything from drug charges to stealing a dog. Is Pete a secret rap fiend? We don\u2019t know. Probably.\n\nAccording to Eddie, the owner of SCD, the video is \u201cnot a parody or a joke\u201d, 10 Daily reports. It may not be a parody, Eddie, but this is absolutely a big fucking joke.\n\n\u201cMost people hang s**t on Mr Dutton, but he\u2019s actually a really good guy,\u201d Eddie said.\u201dWe turned what would be a normal politician\u2019s visit into a fun video. You go through our history on Facebook, that\u2019s what we do. A lot of older companies are in this business, but we\u2019re a young fresh company, so we made something interesting out of it. We were proud of him coming to our business.\u201d\n\nYep, a fresh, young company that is using a not-very-good song from 2003 for their weird political advertisement. Sorry, but the early noughties called and they want their So Fresh Hits of Autumn 2003 CD back, \u201cbro\u201d.\n\nThe video also declares Peter Dutton as the \u201cbaddest MP\u201d, which in hindsight probably isn\u2019t the best campaign slogan. But Eddie cleared it up, reminding us that \u201cbaddest\u201d is quite the compliment in the rap world. Thanks Eddie.\n\n\u201cBy \u2018baddest\u2019, we mean that he\u2019s not afraid to make the tough decisions,\u201d the owner said.\n\nThe video has received nearly 200 comments since it went live on August 30, so uhhh I hope it at least increased business for them because it sure as hell made Dutton look like a fuckwit.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/dutton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
