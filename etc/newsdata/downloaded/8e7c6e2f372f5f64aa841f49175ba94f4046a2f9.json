Walmart WMT, -0.58%, meanwhile, charges $10,000 a month per product for toy brands to get their items on November and December \u201cBuyer\u2019s Picks\u201d toy lists, the report said, quoting a consumer watchdog\u2019s concerns about toy companies\u2019 concealed financial involvement in a list apparently curated by experts.\n\nJim Silver, the CEO and editor-in-chief of the product-review site Toys, Tots, Pets & More, says that while not all retailers engage in this practice, he has heard about it for years. \u201cI just shrugged my shoulders and said, \u2018Well, it took a long time for it to finally hit the media, but it\u2019s been around a long time,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nAn Amazon spokeswoman told MarketWatch in an emailed statement: \u201cEvery product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favorites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys,\u201d she added.\n\nA Walmart spokeswoman told MarketWatch cited a separate \u201cTop Rated by Kids\u201d list and said that suppliers can\u2019t pay for inclusion on that list, which is the retailer\u2019s official holiday-season toy list and features toys tested by kids. Asked specifically about the \u201cBuyer\u2019s Picks\u201d issue reported by Bloomberg, she replied, \u201cWe have many different lists on Walmart.com \u2014 some curated by celebrities like Ellen [DeGeneres], Bobbi Brown and Drew Barrymore, some by influencers, and even the Buyer\u2019s Picks list.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a parent, grandparent or any other consumer on the hunt for age-appropriate toys that kids will use for longer than a week, here are some tips for independent recommendations:\n\nThe best intel comes from the child. \u201cA hot toy might be a hot toy, but it might not be hot for your child,\u201d Silver said. He recalled his older and younger daughters being \u201cBarbie-crazy,\u201d but his middle daughter being more interested in tech and electronics. Ask the parent or care giver how the child\u2019s interests may have changed over the last year, he said.\n\nRead independent toy-review sites. Among such sites is TTPM, which reviews 2,500 toys a year and draws millions of eyeballs to its YouTube GOOG, -0.60% GOOGL, -0.67% toy reviews. \u201cWe pan items \u2014 you\u2019ll find negative reviews on our site,\u201d he said. Silver said his team seeks to identify toys with \u201cgood play value\u201d that kids won\u2019t simply abandon after one use, thus helping parents avoid wasting money.\n\nAlan Fields, co-author of the baby-gear guide \u201cBaby Bargains\u201d and a website by the same name, recommended the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio, which says award-winning products featured on its site were selected by child-development, education and children\u2019s literature experts, in addition to being kid-tested. \u201cUnlike most other groups that rate products, we do not charge entry fees from manufacturers,\u201d the site adds.\n\nAnd in case you\u2019re in the market for baby gear or toys, Baby Bargains vows on its website that it does not take money from the brands it reviews.\n\nThe American Specialty Toy Retailing Association (ASTRA), a trade group that represents independent retailers, manufacturers and sales representatives, leverages the expertise of independent toy-store owners to compile an annual Best Toys for Kids list.\n\nASTRA does not require manufacturers to pay to submit products for consideration, said the association\u2019s president, Kimberly Mosley. However, the retailers and manufacturers obviously have a vested interest in people buying the toys they recommend and make/sell.\n\nVisit local toy stores, which are known for customer service representatives who give you both their expertise and their time, Silver said. Owners and staff know how the products work, might be willing to take toys out of their boxes to let parents and/or children interact with them before buying, and can help you track down a hard-to-find item elsewhere, Mosley said. Local toy stores will often allow shoppers to buy products online and pick them up in-store, and some even gift-wrap for free, she added.\n\nPatronizing these stores supports your local economy, Mosley said, and often leads to your finding a superior product: \u201cWhen a toy store puts products on their shelves, it\u2019s a carefully curated selection,\u201d she said. Check ASTRA\u2019s online store finder to locate your nearest local toy store.\n\nWhen in doubt, try a board game. Board games represent a growing category in the toy business, Silver said: Hobby board-game sales rose 13% from $305 million to $345 million between 2016 and 2017, according to 2018 estimates by the geek-culture trade publication ICv2. Board games exist for all ages, Silver said, and often involve social interaction and thinking.\n\n\u201cIf I had a child and I had no idea what they liked, I\u2019d buy [board] games,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that is the safest thing you can do, because rarely do you meet people who don\u2019t like games.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Experts are toy-store owners with their feet on the floor.\u2019", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT647_amazon_ZG_20191018173112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
