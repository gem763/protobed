Madonna's best songs, according to Independent staff 1/9 \"Don't Tell Me\" (2000) While the Stetson she appeared in for the Music era of 2000 is just one of many hats worn by Madonna, the message of its best single, \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Me\u201d, is one she has practiced her entire career. I was fairly independent as a child and my colleagues would likely agree I\u2019m even more stubborn and wilful as an adult \u2013 Madonna\u2019s defiant lyrics on this track could certainly have had something to do with that. The twangy guitar loop of this electronic-country-pop number provides one of the most recognisable intros in music, as she instructs the listener: \u201cTell the leaves not to turn/ but don\u2019t ever tell me I\u2019ll learn, no, no/ Take the black off a crow/ but don\u2019t tell me I have to go.\u201d \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d, \u201cVogue\u201d and \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d might be more iconic among Madonna fans, but for this one, \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Me\u201d eponymises who she is as an artist, and as a person. (Roisin O'Connor) Rex 2/9 \"Into the Groove\" (1984) Although \"Into the Groove\" isn\u2019t technical musical feat like some of Madonna\u2019s later dance work, such as the electro masterpiece \"Ray of Light\", or pretty much anything on the Confessions album, it encompasses Madonna\u2019s less filtered earlier work, complete with a signature spoken introduction. All of Madonna\u2019s spoken introductions prelude her best work, as if to serve as a siren to dash to the dancefloor before the bassline kicks in. \"Into the Groove\" is the literal finest example of this: when her vocals pop up over a drum and synth intro (\u201cAnd you can dance/For inspiration/ Come on\u201d) I will always want to hit that floor. (Chloe Hubbard) 3/9 \"Papa Don\u2019t Preach\" (1986) Hunting around my parents\u2019 house when I was 10, I found my mum\u2019s Immaculate Collection VHS, the pastel blue box signalling something exciting. Slotting it into the machine, I waited for a song to finish and a fade to black. More than just a story of a young pregnant woman having to break the news to her protective father, \u201cPapa Don\u2019t Preach\u201d is a coming-of-age story. It felt relevant to me even at that age, contrasting with the numerous songs I\u2019d heard telling men\u2019s stories. The impossible-not-to-dance-to beat, the catchy lyrics and that feeling of a song capturing the female experience have stayed with me ever since. And it\u2019s not just me. Put this track on at a wedding and the dance floor will be alight in moments with women shouting the lyrics, dancing like Madonna \u2013 feeling empowered. If that doesn't qualify as an iconic song, I don\u2019t know what does. (Harriet Hall) REUTERS 4/9 \"Like a Virgin\" (1984) From the minute the unmistakable beat of \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d begins to play, you can\u2019t help but start rocking your head from side to side and tapping your feet in sync with the music in true 1980s fashion. Not only is the song undeniably catchy, but it also epitomises several aspects of Madonna\u2019s identity, namely her openness with sexuality and erotica. Some of Madonna\u2019s most iconic moments have come from her performances of the track, such as at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1984 when she appeared on stage wearing a white wedding dress. It\u2019s playful, upbeat and impossible to resist dancing to. What\u2019s not to love? (Sabrina Barr) REX/Shutterstock 5/9 \"Like a Prayer\" (1989) \u200bIs \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d the favourite Madonna song of every lapsed Catholic out there? Maybe it\u2019s over speculation, but there\u2019s some primal part of my Catholic childhood that can\u2019t help but claw to the surface on each listen of the 1989 pop classic. Madonna made no secret of the fact her work was heavily influenced by her own upbringing surrounded by Italian Catholicism and, as she told Rolling Stone in 1989: \u201cOnce you\u2019re a Catholic, you\u2019re always a Catholic - in terms of your feelings of guilt and remorse and whether you\u2019ve sinned or not\u201d. But with \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d, there\u2019s a sense of freedom: an intimate, personal rewriting of religion that breaks the taboos of intermixing sex and religion. Add to that, the radical nature of the track\u2019s video making a sincere statement about racism and police brutality - a message often buried by the hysteria surrounding the Vatican\u2019s own condemnation of it. (Clarisse Loughrey) Getty 6/9 \"Vogue\" (1990) \u200bTo strike a pose is to \u201cVogue\u201d. So much more than a glitzy disco track, Madonna\u2019s \u201cVogue\u201d cements its rank as a pop culture phenomenon thanks to the flamboyant New York City subcultures it celebrates. The dance itself originates in 1980s drag culture and Madonna\u2019s eponymous track is an homage to the sexual freedom and flagrant theatrics that the routine evokes to this day. With its liberal roots and non-binary rhetoric (\u201cit makes no difference if you\u2019re black or white, if you\u2019re a boy or a girl\u201d), \u201cVogue\u201d is the ultimate empowerment anthem, fuelled by grandeur, old-school glamour, and an insatiable appetite for fun. It\u2019s a corker. (Olivia Petter) ITV/REX/Shutterstock 7/9 \"Beautiful Stranger\" (1999) Madonna\u2019s enjoyably psychedelic \u201cBeautiful Stranger\u201d was the perfect selection as main soundtrack single for Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me. Co-written by William Orbit, the man behind Blur\u2019s \u201cCoffee and TV\u201d as well as All Saints belter \u201cPure Shores\u201d, the song draws instrumentally from unexpected places (The Beatles, The Doors) with its drum-free guitar-backed opening verse setting the stage for that roaring chorus: \u201cYou\u2019re everywhere I go! And everybody knows!\u201d It\u2019s a flawless slice of late-1990s pop that\u2019s as good as anything Madonna\u2019s ever recorded. Groovy, baby. (Jacob Stolworthy) Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images 8/9 \"La Isla Bonita\" (1986) On the very rare (two) occasions I\u2019ve done karaoke, it says something that the song I\u2019ve picked both times was \"La Isla Bonita\". I\u2019m a sucker for melody \u2013 and especially one that\u2019s uptempo yet loaded with a melancholic yearning to be on a mysterious tropical island. From the opening Cuban drums, followed by castanets, it\u2019s the winning blend of Latin rhythms and Spanish guitar with 1980s synths, and the sweetness of Madonna\u2019s cooing vocals, that makes \u201cLa Isla Bonita\u201d stand out \u2013 and it was the first Spanish-tinged track that Madonna released. It\u2019s so distinctive that it\u2019s impossible to imagine this on Michael Jackson\u2019s Bad album, for which the track was initially written. Romantic, evocative and always alluring. (Elisa Bray) 9/9 \"Material Girl\" (1984) While some may criticise \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d for being shallow, it is in fact a feminist anthem. Sure, prioritising money and shiny things over personality may not be the best approach when looking for a partner, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with appreciating fashion and the finer things in life \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re frivolous, vain or superficial, as Madonna points out. Because the thing is, some boys may kiss you and some boys may hug you (consensually, one would hope), but if they don\u2019t give you proper credit, you really should just walk away. (Rachel Hosie) Rex 1/9 \"Don't Tell Me\" (2000) While the Stetson she appeared in for the Music era of 2000 is just one of many hats worn by Madonna, the message of its best single, \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Me\u201d, is one she has practiced her entire career.
