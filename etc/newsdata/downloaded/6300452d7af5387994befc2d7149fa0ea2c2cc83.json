Speaking to Joe Scarborough, O\u2019Rourke said Wednesday that non-compliance will result in law enforcement coming to your home to take your guns.\n\n.@BetoORourke says if someone refuses to turn in their AR-15s then \u201cin that case I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm\u2026\u201dhttps://t.co/i0eRK7w63H pic.twitter.com/QdxsBV7Kyr \u2014 Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) October 16, 2019\n\nHow would law enforcement know who owns banned firearms? Beto doesn\u2019t say, because Beto doesn\u2019t know. Instead, he just keeps repeating his claim that most Americans would abide by the ban and confiscation plan, because most Americans follow the law.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s rapid response director also chimed in on Twitter to try and salvage her boss\u2019s bad idea.\n\nIf someone is publicly, flagrantly stating that they refuse to comply with the law, as in Joe\u2019s scenario, of course there will be legal consequences. This is how it works with any law. Republicans are usually pretty in favor of that concept. https://t.co/iWagmZxQ7h \u2014 Lauren Hitt (@LaurenHitt) October 16, 2019\n\nIf Beto really believed that, then why isn\u2019t he calling for federal enforcement of cannabis laws in states that have legalized it despite a federal prohibition? He\u2019s not, because he believes that federal prohibition to be a bad law (for the record, I do too). But Beto can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nSpeaking of having it both ways, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign can\u2019t seem to decide if it\u2019s going to double down or back away from his \u201cHell yes we\u2019re taking your AR-15\u201d proclamation from a few weeks ago.\n\nBeto would not send officers door to door to collect weapons \u2013 just as we do not send the IRS door to door to collect taxes. \u2014 Lauren Hitt (@LaurenHitt) October 16, 2019\n\nHitt also tried to tie Beto\u2019s plan back to Australia\u2019s \u201cbuyback\u201d of firearms in 1996, but had to engage in an outright lie to do so by claiming that Australia \u201ceffectively\u201d ended mass shootings with its confiscation program. That\u2019s simply not true. There was a mass shooting in Darwin, Australia earlier this year, as a matter of fact.\n\nO\u2019Rourke is getting a lot of attention for his comments, but it\u2019s not the kind of attention he needs at the moment. When even Joe Scarborough and Anderson Cooper are questioning the practicality of your proposals, and your campaign\u2019s only answer is \u201cI think people will follow the law if we make it\u201d, you\u2019re not helping your cause.\n\nWith any law in this country, there are a few people who may not comply, but the overwhelming majority of Americans do voluntarily comply with our laws, even when they don\u2019t like them, and we have every reason to expect that Americans would do the same with a buyback program. \u2014 Lauren Hitt (@LaurenHitt) October 16, 2019\n\nIf you really believe that you have every reason to expect that Americans would go along with a buyback program, you really don\u2019t know American gun owners very well. In fact, you don\u2019t know Americans very well. There are plenty of laws that millions of Americans choose not to follow. As I previously noted, O\u2019Rourke wants to legalize cannabis in part because millions of Americans are choosing to disobey that federal statute. What would lead Beto think that millions of Americans would voluntarily hand over their firearms just because the government says so?\n\nFor weeks now, Beto O\u2019Rourke has been asked variations of the question \u201cwhat will you do if people don\u2019t comply?\u201d and he still has no good answer. He\u2019s talked about fines for those who don\u2019t turn their guns in, but can\u2019t say how much the fine would be. Now he says law enforcement would come to your door if you don\u2019t hand over your gun, but he can\u2019t tell you how law enforcement would even be aware of who owns what guns absent a federal gun registry. He can\u2019t even tell you what law enforcement agencies would be tasked with going to homes and telling people to hand over their firearms.\n\nO\u2019Rourke doesn\u2019t have a serious plan. He has a vision, and it\u2019s time he takes off his rose-colored glasses and views things as they are, not how he wishes them to be.", "description": "Beto O'Rourke is still trying to explain how his gun ban and mandatory compensated confiscation plan would work, but he doesn't have any good answers.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/df70e45d-db25-4f5c-adf4-10277a1f7f10.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
