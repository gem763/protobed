From Chelsea\u2019s dogged pressing up front it was clear they were still stinging from being denied Champions League football after a third-place finish in the WSL last season and losing 5-0 to the Gunners at home.\n\n\u201cIf you get it right you\u2019re an unbelievable manager, if you don\u2019t you\u2019re a pile of s----. I got it right today\u201d, said Chelsea manager Emma Hayes. \u201cYou can lose a season at the beginning of the year but you don\u2019t necessarily win it. So I can say that we are not out of the title race, which this time last year we were, that\u2019s the difference.\u201d\n\nYet again it was Chelsea that were to be Arsenal\u2019s undoing, a late winner from Maria Thorisdottir securing the win for the home side in a tense finish in front of a record crowd for a league game at Kingsmeadow.
