Matthew O. Williams, 38, was previously awarded the Silver Star for his actions that day in the Shok Valley in Afghanistan\u2019s Nuristan Province. On Oct. 30, that decoration will be upgraded to the Medal of Honor at the White House, officials said.\n\nMaster Sgt. Williams was a weapons sergeant in the 3rd Special Forces Group when his Green Beret A-Team, known as Operational Detachment Alpha 3336, was assigned to capture of kill high-value members of the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin militia group. Because of the inaccessible terrain, the Green Berets and a larger Afghan Army commando force inserted into the region by helicopter.\n\nGunfire erupted as Master Sgt. Williams and the others began climbing their way up the ice-covered mountain.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of quiet and then all of a sudden everything exploded all at once,\u201d he said in a statement released by the Army. The insurgents \u201chad some pretty good shooters and a lot of people up there waiting for us.\u201d\n\nWhen he found out the lead element had sustained serious injuries, Master Sgt. Williams quickly gathered the Afghan soldiers and led a counterattack across a 100-meter long valley of ice-covered rocks and a fast-moving, waist-deep river.\n\n\u201cAfter leading his commandos up the mountainside to the besieged element, Williams arrayed his Afghan commandos to provide suppressive fire to keep the insurgents from overrunning the position,\u201d Army officials said in a statement.\n\nMaster Sgt. Williams also braved enemy fire to rescue wounded U.S. and Afghan troops and move them down the mountainside to a casualty collection point.\n\n\u201cRealizing the danger to the wounded, Williams again led the Afghan commandos in a counterattack and fought for several hours against the insurgents, keeping them at bay until helicopters arrived to evacuate the wounded,\u201d Army officials said in a statement.\n\nArmy officials said his actions saved \u201cnumerous\u201d lives and prevented his element from being overrun. \u201cThat day was one of the worst predicaments of my life at that point (but) the experience from that has helped me through my whole entire career,\u201d Master Sgt. Williams said.\n\nHe is from Boerne, Texas, and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree from Angelo State University in San Angelo, Texas. Master Sgt. Williams enlisted in the Army in September 2005. He remains in the Army and is assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, N.C.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
