A person can invest weeks getting to know someone via phone and cyberspace, only to experience a first date that couldn\u2019t end fast enough. Or, there might be something they looked forward to for decades \u2014 maybe landing a particular job or moving to a certain city \u2014 only to learn that the reality isn\u2019t close to their fantasy.\n\nBut in sports, the reward is often sweeter the longer the delay.\n\nThe Cubs went 108 years between World Series wins, and no one in Chicago felt unfulfilled after the wait. The Red Sox won World Series 86 years apart, and New Englanders toasted the drought along with the trophy. If the Cleveland Indians eventually break through (they haven\u2019t won a title in 71 years), their fans would be overcome with too much joy to fret about the lag.\n\nSuch is the case for Washington baseball fans today. The Nationals have won the pennant. The D.C. team has advanced to the World Series. The pain endured in the 86 years along the way no longer matters. All is well; all is forgiven.\n\nRemember when the Nationals won the NL East, in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017, but failed to win a playoff series in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017? That was an awful feeling, right? It made you wonder if the Nats would ever advance \u2026 assuming they ever reached the postseason again, after missing it altogether last year.\n\nThe first round had become an albatross that threatened to choke belief. But, now, that notion causes hysterical laughter. Raise a glass to whoever looked at the record and said the Nationals fall apart in October.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a misconception,\u201d first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said Tuesday after Washington completed a sweep in the NL Championship Series against St. Louis with a 7-4 victory. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s easy to win in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s really hard to get to the playoffs, and second of all, you\u2019re playing against the elite teams of the elite league. You\u2019ve got to catch some breaks. \u2026 I think we caught some breaks this year, but more importantly, we took advantage of those breaks,\u201d he said.\n\nReaching the playoffs might not be easy, but the Nationals have made it expected, with five trips in eight seasons. That feat alone almost atones the franchise\u2019s first seven seasons in D.C., which featured 91 losses on average and five last-place finishes.\n\nThe Nationals had replaced the Washington Senators all too well, including the noncompetitive disposition. The Sens were mostly lousy through their 71 years and two incarnations dating to 1901. But even bad baseball beat none at all, which was the case in D.C. for 34 years after the Senators became the Twins and the Senators II became the Rangers.\n\nWashington\u2019s designation as a baseball desert created double agony for fans. There was the heartache of what was lost and the false hope of what was rumored. We no longer had a team, but the Padres would be here soon. When that never materialized, the Giants were on their way. Attempts to relocate the Orioles fizzled.\n\nTwo rounds of expansion provided openings that were filled by Florida and Colorado, and then Tampa Bay and Phoenix. The Astros were supposed to move and play in Virginia near Dulles Airport, which for D.C. would\u2019ve been a wound more than a salve.\n\nBefore this postseason run to the Fall Classic, everything about Washington baseball hurt, except the World Series victory in 1924.\n\nNow, 95 years later, nothing since then is relevant.\n\nLosing to the Houston Astros or New York Yankees wouldn\u2019t change a thing about our feelings toward this Nationals club. Reaching the Series isn\u2019t the ultimate goal, but it\u2019s the next-best-thing. Of the NL\u2019s 15 clubs, 14 must look up and bow down to the Nats.\n\nThose NLDS against St. Louis, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles? They don\u2019t sting so much anymore. The dreadful record in elimination games at Nationals Park? It\u2019s no longer an issue? The 19-31 record, #FireDaveyMartinez tweets, and calls for a fire sale? They\u2019re just logs on the fire, fuel for an unbelievable story that continues next week.\n\nWhen outfielder Victor Robles settled under a fly ball Tuesday night in the top of the ninth, the final out was recorded.\n\nAnd just like that, the pain of a long wait was erased.\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
