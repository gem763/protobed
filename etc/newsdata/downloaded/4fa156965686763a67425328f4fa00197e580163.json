However, talks have been at a standstill for nearly two years, with frequent diplomatic provocations souring efforts to build goodwill.\n\nThe United States and the EU see tensions between Serbia and Kosovo as a major threat to regional stability and are pushing for a normalisation of relations.\n\nOn Thursday, US President Donald Trump appointed Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Germany, as special envoy to try to inject new energy into the talks between Belgrade and Pristina.\n\nTariff move ' amateur'\n\nOne of the core obstacles to resuming talks is the 100 percent tariff that Haradinaj slapped on Serbian goods a year ago.\n\nHaving resisted heavy Western pressure to remove the tariff, the former commander is hoping voters will reward his tough stance by re-electing him.\n\nAll the other top candidates, however, have shown a willingness to reconsider the tariff for the sake of dialogue.\n\n190821131927415\n\nKadri Veseli, leader of the Democratic Party of Kosovo, which was part of the outgoing coalition with now-rival Haradinaj, has condemned the tariff move as \"amateur\", and said he would honour Washington's calls to remove it.\n\nOpposition party candidates Vjosa Osmani, from the centre-right Democratic League of Kosovo, and Albin Kurti, from the left-wing and nationalist Vetevendosje, also seem willing to lift the trade barrier to resume talks.\n\nThe pair has also left open the possibility of joining forces after the polls, an alliance that could remove the so-called \"war parties\".\n\nHowever, with no camp expected to take home an absolute majority, coalition talks could drag on for weeks.", "description": "Winner likely to face pressure to renew dialogue with the EU, which continues to reject Kosovo's independence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/6/1512711a3c4540279af8a03235578a62_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
