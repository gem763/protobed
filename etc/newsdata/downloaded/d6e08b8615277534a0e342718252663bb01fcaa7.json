Steven Spielberg is writing a horror series for short-form streaming service Quibi, and bringing \u201cMasters of the Air\u201d \u2014 his second follow-up to \u201cBand of Brothers\u201d \u2014 to Apple\u2019s new platform.\n\nBen Stiller \u2014 who has shot hit movies including \u201cTropic Thunder,\u201d \u201cZoolander\u201d and \u201cThe Cable Guy\u201d \u2014 returned to his television roots this year behind the camera, directing Showtime\u2019s prison break drama \u201cEscape at Dannemora.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never done anything quite like this,\u201d he told journalists at a Los Angeles TV summit. \u201cI knew I always wanted to do more serious stuff and work in different areas as a director.\u201d\n\n\u201cTelevision has changed,\u201d he added.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 From Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep to Reese Witherspoon and Michael Douglas, Hollywood movie stars are being lured to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/bb4b06_jennifer-aniston-reese-witherspoon-are-reportedly-earning-million-per-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
