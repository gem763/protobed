This Should Be a National Scandal.", "language": "en", "text": "The census is usually a dull affair. But thanks to the Trump administration, it\u2019s now a slow-boiling controversy that might take down Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department administers the census, and who appears to have lied under oath to Congress.\n\nThe reason is a single question that the administration has sought to add to the census: whether the respondent is an American citizen. On the surface, this may seem innocuous, but based on several studies, it will almost certainly lead to under-participation by communities of color, especially Latinos. As a result, some states will have less representation in the House of Representatives than they otherwise should and will get less money from the federal government. \u201cBlue states\u201d like California and New York would be hardest hit, as would Texas, which is increasingly Democratic.\n\nIn other words, the citizenship question is another tactic of voter suppression.\n\nSecretary Ross approved the question on March 26, but there are now six lawsuits over the change. One of them is headed to the Supreme Court, in what will likely be Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s first politically contentious case.\n\nFrom the start, the proposal was controversial, and opposed by nearly every expert on the census who voiced an opinion about it. Independent experts all agreed it would deter Latinos from answering the census for fear of exposing themselves or family members to deportation or investigation. But whose idea was it?\n\nIn March, Secretary Ross testified under oath that the Department of Justice asked him to make the change in a December 2017 letter, so that they could better enforce the Voting Rights Act.\n\nBut emails uncovered in one of the lawsuits revealed that that was a lie. In fact, Ross had requested that DOJ send the letter to justify the policy change that he\u2019d already decided to make. So if not the Justice Department, then who?\n\nTurns out, Ross also lied under oath about whether he\u2019d talked with presidential advisers Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach. Ross testified that he had not\u2014but now we know that he had discussed the issue with them in the spring of 2017, and that Kobach proposed the specific language for the citizenship question.\n\nKobach was the architect of voter suppression in Kansas, where as secretary of state he suspended more than 36,000 Kansas voters, disproportionately people of color. Then he was unable to prove any cases of fraud in a federal lawsuit. Kobach then went on to head Trump\u2019s discredited \u201cvoter fraud\u201d commission, which disbanded before finding a single instance of fraud. He is now the Republican nominee for the governor of Kansas, having won the primary under suspicious circumstances.\n\nPhil Sparks, co-director of the Census Project, a coalition of around 200 stakeholder organizations \u201ccommitted to a fair and accurate census,\u201d told The Daily Beast that the citizenship question was a \u201cblatant political move.\u201d\n\n\u201c The census is one of the few government functions that\u2019s embedded in the Constitution. \u201d \u2014 Phil Sparks, the Census Project\n\nRoss even lied about the \u201cfact-finding\u201d meetings he held in early 2018 with civil rights and community organizations. But now we know that his mind was already made up.\n\n\u201cThose were sham interviews!\u201d Sparks said.\n\n\u201cWe were\u2014to put it mildly\u2014totally dismayed by his actions in March 2018,\u201d Sparks said, \u201cbut also confounded and confused by his misleading statements to stakeholders a year earlier when he initiated the process.\u201d\n\nSparks noted that the Census Project is a non-partisan coalition, including business, labor, trade organizations, and several chambers of commerce.\n\nThe six lawsuits allege that the citizenship question is unconstitutional\u2014\u201cthe census is one of the few government functions that\u2019s embedded in the Constitution,\u201d Sparks observed\u2014as well as adopted without the necessary administrative review. The leading suit is taking place in New York and joined by 18 state attorneys general.\n\nThe question now is whether Secretary Ross can be compelled to give a sworn deposition in the lawsuit. The federal judge in the New York case has ordered him (as well as John Gore, the official from the Justice Department who allegedly came up with the pretext for the change) to do so, but the Trump administration has appealed that decision straight to the Supreme Court.\n\nA decision from the Court is expected any day now. Justice Ginsburg, who was assigned the appeal, temporarily halted the order last week. She may decide the matter herself, or all the justices may rule immediately, or the Court may request full briefing and oral argument. In any case, the Court is expected to act quickly, since the printing of 2020 census forms is set to begin in just a few months.\n\nIf the matter is referred to the full court, it will be Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s first politically contentious case.\n\nEven without Ross\u2019s and Gore\u2019s depositions, the documents unearthed already led Republicans and Democrats alike to demand answers from Secretary Ross.\n\n\"The Trump administration has never told the American people the truth about the citizenship question, and it is increasingly clear that DOJ engaged in pretextual exercise to justify a political decision that could have serious consequences for the accuracy of the census,\" said Austin Evers, Executive Director of American Oversight, said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have vowed to nix the citizenship question entirely if they retake control of Congress in 2019.\n\nAs is often the case though, at this point the cover-up may be bigger than the crime, so to speak. Regardless of who said what to whom about the citizenship question, Ross clearly misled Congress in his sworn testimony, and that may have its own set of consequences. Making a false statement to a government agency is a felony, and the FBI could launch a criminal investigation, especially if directed to do so by a newly Democratic House committee.\n\nGiven the clear contradiction between Ross\u2019s testimony and the email record, the investigation should be an open and shut case.\n\nThat is, if this \u201csilent scandal\u201d can command anyone\u2019s attention in a year of 15-minute news cycles, Russia probes, Supreme Court nomination fiascoes, foreign policy snafus, and midterm elections.\n\nSparks said that it should. The Census Bureau\u2019s goal is to \u201ccount everyone once, only once, and in the right place.\u201d Yet Ross has undermined that goal by transparently playing politics. \u201cThe census data will be used to reapportion Congress,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cThat\u2019s the jewel in the crown.\u201d\n\nDeeper still, the question is profoundly un-American.\n\n\u201cThe Founding Fathers understood the importance of the decennial census,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they mandated it in the Constitution. They knew that political power should shift every ten years as states gain or lost population... These are not normal political times.\u201d", "description": "The commerce secretary lied under oath about a new policy that could rob Democratic states of power: asking people if they are American citizens.", "authors": ["Jay Michaelson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1539839452/181019-michaelson-wilbur-ross-census-hero_rv0eiy", "published_at": "2018-10-18"}
