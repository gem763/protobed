Because I really do believe that Bob Iger\u2019s guidance and decency is exactly what the country needs right now.\u201d\n\nActress Jennifer Garner was also adamant that Iger would make a great presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cMr. Iger is everything you could want in a leader,\u201d Garner said. \u201cI dare to say he is presidential. He\u2019s dignified, he\u2019s a risk-taker, he is down to earth, he is wise, and he has integrity. I would hand him any job I possibly could,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cIs it too late?\u201d Garner added.\n\nFor his part, Iger invoked Ronald Reagan from the dais.\n\n\u201cOprah, I am reminded of something that Ronald Reagan said to Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential debate, \u2018There you go again.\u2019 Please, I am not about to become the 25th or the 30th person seeking the presidency in 2020,\u201d Iger joked.\n\nHe went on to say that he hopes whoever becomes president in 2020 will \u201cmake the safety and well-being of children their number one priority.\u201d\n\nIger was rumored to have been considering a run for the Democrat nomination early this year and even took a meeting with former President Barack Obama on the issue.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "It appears that Oprah Winfrey has found one person who she thinks could make a good president: Disney CEO Bob Iger.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/oprahbobIger1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
