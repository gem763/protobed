Take a look at America\u2019s golden crop, , which is enticing investors to go long, just as other commodities are wilting under the weight of the mighty .\n\nDelayed plantings and a political bear hug from President Donald Trump to ethanol producers could combine in the second prize bonanza since summer for corn, the largest U.S. crop.\n\nFreeze And Inclement Weather Hit Corn Crop\n\nU.S. corn futures are on track to a fifth straight weekly gain as rapidly changing weather brings a hard freeze to much of the western and northern reaches of the corn/soy belt. In the Northern Plains and Minnesota, there\u2019s even the likelihood of snow\u2014yes, this early into fall\u2014on Saturday.\n\n\n\nDan Hueber, a veteran agricultural analyst, sounded a caution on Monday on the production squeeze expected for corn from cooler temperatures and inordinate moisture, running from Minnesota to the Northwest and the Great Lakes across the Northern Plains to eastern New Mexico.Said Hueber:\n\n\u201cCertainty neither is welcome news for crops that are behind average for this date.\u201d\n\nHeavy Shorting In Corn Signaling Long Rebound\n\nHe and other analysts watching fund managers\u2019 positioning in corn also noticed something else: Too many were still shorting futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nAccording to the weekly Commitment of Traders report from Friday, large speculators were still short on 376,055 contracts versus longs at 362,049. The net short of 14,006 could be flipped in a week and there\u2019s potential for a long and lasting rally.\n\nAfter settling Monday\u2019s trade at under $3.88 per bushel, corn futures are likely to breach $4 if they maintain their present trajectory, charts show.\n\nCorn Daily Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nThe last time that happened was in the course of a nine-week stretch between late May and July, when prices reached a five-year high above $4.64.\n\nThat breakout came after a similar pattern of under plantings in spring. However, the early-summer explosion in corn prices turned out to be a bull trap, with net losses of nearly 17% for longs in the three months to August.\n\nThere is no certainty yet how the current round will end.\n\nAdvice To Corn Bulls: Plan Trade Stops To Avoid Summer Disaster\n\nEric Scoles, commodity market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, however, said those nimble with well-positioned stops should be able to avoid getting crushed in price collapses.Scoles urged traders to closely follow crop progress reports by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the next of which falls on Thursday. The pre-USDA report breakdown for corn is estimated at 13.636 billion bushels, derived from a harvested acreage of 81.57 million and a yield of 167.1 bushels per annum. Said Scoles:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen already stocks could be far below previous estimates. Crop maturity is well behind normal, and the previous USDA reports were suspicious at best.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis summer\u2019s dramatic (market) rise and fall has left many traders and farmers frustrated. It\u2019s possible that if the bull case is proven accurate in upcoming reports, there could be a buying frenzy from those who got burned this summer.\u201d\n\n'Fair' Upside [[0|Target]] At $3.98?\n\nScoles also pointed out that the front-month December corn contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was exhibiting what appeared like \u201ca classic bull flag on the daily chart, after a gap-filling rally sparked by bullish news.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typical for a market to pause or pull back slightly before making its next move with fundamental support and I think that is what we are seeing here now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a fair target for the next leg up could be about $3.980.\u201d\n\nInvesting.com\u2019s Daily Technical Outlook has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendation for December corn, with top-end resistance pegged at $3.9038.\n\nWhite House Help For\n\nAnother unexpected boon for corn could come from the White House, with Trump bowing to pressure from ethanol millers and Midwestern corn farmers to raise the biofuel\u2019s mandated quantity in gasoline blends ahead of next year's presidential election.\n\nEthanol is primarily made from corn, a major crop and industry in the Midwestern states that proved crucial to Trump's 2016 victory. Under a plan announced on Friday, oil refineries would be required to blend at least 15 billion gallons of ethanol into the nation's fuel supply beginning next year, up from what in practice was less than 14 billion.\n\nCrude oil refiners across Texas were reportedly fuming at the decision, as they had lobbied the president for more than a year to reduce the ethanol additive in gasoline, which they say adds unnecessarily to costs. Ethanol was originally mandated to reduce the amount of imported required by local refiners when processing gasoline\u2014but now refiners argue it has become redundant, after the boom in shale oil production has made the United States the world\u2019s largest producer, away from crude.\n\nGasoline\u2019s Loss Is Corn\u2019s Gain\n\nAccording to Scientific American, roughly 40% of U.S. corn is used for making ethanol. Scott Segal, a Washington-based attorney for the refining industry, didn\u2019t miss the significance of this, as he remarked in a weekend story in the Houston oil publication, Chron:\n\n\"With the ethanol industry, too much is never enough. The administration really has no assurance that agribusiness won't demand more and more, just as they always have.\"\n\nGasoline\u2019s loss in this case seems to be the gain of ethanol\u2014or, more precisely, corn.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: XAU/USD, US Dollar Index Futures, Gold Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
