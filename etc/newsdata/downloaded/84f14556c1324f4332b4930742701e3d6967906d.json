Walk us through your thought process. Why you would think this was an appropriate thing to do?'\" she said.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau responds to questions on his campaign plane after a picture of him wearing brownface in 2001 were published by Time magazine on Sept. 18, 2019. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\n\nWhile there is no recent study of newsroom diversity in Canada, a 2006 study of 37 Canadian newsrooms found that just 3.4 per cent of their journalists were Indigenous or people of colour, compared to 16.7 per cent of the general population.\n\n\"The newsrooms are totally not reflective of Canadian society whatsoever,\" said Tanya Talaga, Toronto Star columnist and author of Seven Fallen Feathers. \"We see the lack of our voices, meaning the lack of coverage on everything.\"\n\nLi said that led to stories like the Trudeau blackface scandal being covered in a reductive way that focused on \"outrage and reactions,\" without enough context of the underlying issues behind the story.\n\n\"The Canadian public isn't even primed to understand [the story] because there wasn't ongoing coverage of race in a consistent way,\" Li said. \"And we can't cover these issues in a vacuum.\"\n\nBeyond this story, Talaga said since the start of the election campaign, she had seen a general lack of coverage on political issues affecting Indigenous people, like the impact of climate change on their communities, or missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nTrudeau is shown in this 2001 photo published in the yearbook of West Point Grey Academy, a private school where Trudeau was teaching at the time.

They need to be at the table,\" she said.\n\nAnd for the rest of the election, Krishan had this advice for white reporters who might be intimidated to talk about race: \"Educate yourself.\"\n\n\"We are reporters. That's our job, is to do research,\" she said. \"It's pretty straightforward. You just have to do that work.\"\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
