Fuel was poured over it and a lit cigarette thrown in. The court heard that if it had exploded it would have caused a devastating firebomb and killed or injured at least 60 people in a nearby bar.\n\nBut the women had chosen diesel \u2013 much less flammable than petrol \u2013 and, despite several attempts, the car did not catch fire. The state prosecutor said that only this mistake avoided \u201ccarnage\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A court sketch of In\u00e8s Madani, 22, who posed online as a male Isis fighter.

Pretending to be a man, she attracted several women into online courtships, in which they pledged themselves in marriage. Each time, Madani disguised her voice on the phone.\n\nPosing as \u201cAbou Soulayman\u201d, a jihadist just back from Syria, Madani had approached Gilligmann through social networks and an online religious quiz. Gilligmann quickly entered into an \u201cintense virtual relationship\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A court sketch of Ornella Gilligmann, who entered an \u2018intense virtual relationship\u2019 with Madani.

Gilligmann said they \u201ctalked about marriage, the future, children\u201d and she sent nude photos of herself.\n\nThe court heard that Madani had liked the attention of the women who fell in love with her fake male personas online. She said it filled an \u201cemptiness\u201d, telling the court: \u201cI didn\u2019t have much to do with my days.\u201d\n\nThe court heard that Madani, the fourth of five daughters of a bus driver, had turned to both drugs and religious study after being sexually assaulted aged 17. A close female friend had left for Isis\u2019 self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria and Madani\u2019s father had warned the authorities his daughter was also susceptible to leave for jihad.\n\nThe court heard that Madani spent \u201c80% of her time in her room, under the duvet, the blinds closed \u2026 on her computer or phone. She lived like a recluse.\u201d\n\nWhen Madani and Gilligmann finally met in a burger bar in the Paris suburbs a few weeks before the failed Notre Dame attack, Madani said she was the sister of \u201cAbou Soulayman\u201d who had come in his place. Later, in prison awaiting trial, Gilligmann was said to have continued to struggle to accept that Abou Soulayman had never existed.\n\nThe court psychiatrist who assessed the women said each had been radicalised before they came together and \u201ceach wanted to show the other they were the greatest jihadist\u201d.\n\nThibault de Montbrial, a lawyer representing civil parties to the case, told the court the \u201csocial and economic excuses\u201d should be set aside. He said Madani was \u201ca major figure in jihadism in France and expert in manipulation\u201d, and that Gilligmann had also been extremely radicalised \u201cbefore meeting her virtual prince charming\u201d. He said they had both belonged to a terrorist network.\n\nThe state prosecutor called the women \u201cthe face of female jihad\u201d, saying they had sought to cause maximum death.\n\nWhen the car bomb failed to ignite, the women fled. Gilligmann was arrested in the south of France. Madani, following the advice of her Isis handler, went to Boussy-Saint-Antoine, a small town south-east of Paris, where she joined other women who were said in court to have become radicalised.\n\nFearing they were being watched by police, Madani and the women she was with fled the flat armed with a kitchen knife. One woman attempted to stab a plainclothes officer and Madani was shot in the legs by police officers as she fled.\n\nIn total, five women were on trial accused of involvement in a terrorist group or terrorist activity. The court, made up of professional magistrates without a jury, was told that two of the women had suffered sexual assault or rape, others had experienced weight issues or an eating disorder. Many had had troubled relationships with their family.\n\nAnother woman and man were accused of failing to report a terrorist crime.\n\nRachid Kassim, an Isis fighter who was said in court documents to have coordinated the failed Notre Dame attack as well as other attacks in France from his base in Syria, was also on trial in absentia. He is believed to have been killed in Iraq, but without proof of his death he was tried.\n\nA verdict is expected on Monday or Tuesday.", "description": "Two women are at centre of trial exposing role of female jihadists in French terrorism", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12ab316eac8414ec9ac9ea43069daed521512fff/0_120_4486_2692/master/4486.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac7ccf12d712c037fb0066db1fd126bb", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
