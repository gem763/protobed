The Dutch boxer had initially been awarded a 3-2 victory, but it was overturned on appeal.\n\nIt equals the achievements of Nicola Adams and Savannah Marshall, who won the world crown in 2016 and 2012 respectively.\n\nPrice\u2019s gold was the highlight of a great week for Great Britain\u2019s women which saw them win three medals as Karris Artingstall and Demie-Jade Resztan claimed bronze at featherweight (57kg) and light-flyweight (48kg).\n\nPrice, 24, said: \u201cIt all feels like a bit of a dream at the minute. I have dreamt of being world champion for most of my life, so to finally achieve it feels unreal.\n\n\u201cIt was a close fight and I did think I had won it with my work in the second and third rounds so once it went to review I thought there was a good chance it would go in my favour.", "description": "Lauren Price was crowned world amateur champion in dramatic circumstances at the AIBA Women\u2019s World Boxing Championships in Russia, after the judges\u2019 overturned the result of her final against Nouchka Fontijn of Holland.", "authors": ["Gareth A Davies", "Boxing Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000210909948-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNoGXySPv9M1Jbe0Fc3Bi1Fk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
