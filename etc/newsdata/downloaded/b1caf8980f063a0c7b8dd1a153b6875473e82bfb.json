Kenneth Feinberg, who wasn\u2019t involved in the Las Vegas deal, said he oversaw $7.1 billion in victim compensation after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and $6.5 billion following the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe amount of the settlement depends on the number of plaintiffs who take part, according to a statement from Las Vegas law firm Eglet Adams, which represents nearly 2,500 victims.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to resolve these matters so our community and the victims and their families can move forward in the healing process,\u201d said Jim Murren, chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts.\n\nAn independent administrator will be appointed by a court to dole out money from the settlement fund, attorneys and MGM said. They expect to wrap up the work by late next year, a timeline that Feinberg called \u201cvery realistic.\u201d\n\nMGM\u2019s insurers will put a minimum of $735 million into the settlement fund. Depending on the number of victims who participate, the company will contribute more, up to $800 million, according to victims\u2019 attorneys.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s agreement marks a milestone in the recovery process for the victims of the horrifying events of 1 October,\u201d Robert Eglet, a lead plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, said in the statement. \u201cWhile nothing will be able to bring back the lives lost or undo the horrors so many suffered on that day, this settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their families.\u201d\n\nA country music festival became a killing ground when a 64-year-old retired accountant and high-stakes video poker player fired out the windows of his hotel room into the crowd.\n\nStephen Paddock killed himself as authorities closed in, and they found 23 assault-style weapons in his room, many equipped with bump stocks that allow firearms to fire rapidly like machine guns.\n\nPolice and the FBI found that Paddock meticulously planned the attack and theorized that he may have sought notoriety. But they said they never determined a clear motive.\n\nAs legal claims piled up, MGM drew outrage when it filed lawsuits last year against more than 1,900 victims in a bid to avoid liability. The company argued that it didn\u2019t owe anything to survivors or families of slain victims under a federal law enacted after 9/11.\n\nAttorneys for victims are planning news conferences on Thursday in Las Vegas and San Diego.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two years after a shooter rained gunfire on country music fans from a high-rise Las Vegas hotel, MGM Resorts International reached a settlement that could pay up to $800 million to families of the 58 people who died and hundreds of others who were injured, attorneys announced Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Ritter"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/las_vegas_shooting_anniversary_50023_c0-68-5184-3090_s1770x1032.jpg?31a1a9bdd70fdb09d6f013c76efd8cfe31355f48"}
