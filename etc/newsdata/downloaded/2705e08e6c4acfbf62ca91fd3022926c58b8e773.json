Nor was it Rice\u2019s \u201cIX\u201d formation, for Title IX, to mock a sexual assault investigation at Baylor. It was not even Yale\u2019s pants-dropping incident.\n\nNo, the sin that caused the banishment of the Columbia University marching band for the entire 2019 football season was \u2026 late paperwork.\n\nIt had nothing to do, the Columbia administration explained, with the band\u2019s tradition of bursting into the library, trumpets blaring, on the eve of the organic chemistry final. It wasn\u2019t on account of bawdy routines and occasionally crude chants at football games, or fears of what might be in store when Robert K. Kraft, the New England Patriots owner and a Columbia football benefactor , turned up at a game.\n\nNo, the university said, the hammer had to come down because the band had failed to submit its application for funding on time. And if these impressionable young people are not held to account, then a deadline becomes nothing more than a two-syllable word, creating a loose thread that threatens to unravel the social fabric .", "description": "The university has prohibited its scramble band, often irreverent and sometimes funny, from performing at athletic events, and plans to form a more traditional band after the football season.", "authors": ["Billy Witz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/sports/01columbiaband-1/merlin_161752470_a6602d0c-f650-4896-870b-4320dd5a719c-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
