Putin of Russia would not be made public \u2014 a disclosure that would likely generate far more attention.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s conversations with Mr. Putin have been an enduring mystery and a subject of intense interest, given the evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Mr. Trump, who has adopted a friendlier stance toward Moscow than his predecessors.\n\nTwo days after the White House released a reconstruction of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov was asked if he worried about the confidentiality of the American president\u2019s contacts with Mr. Putin.\n\n\u201cWe would like to hope that we would not see such situations in our bilateral relations, which already have plenty of quite serious problems,\u201d he said in a conference call with reporters.", "description": "The contents of conversations between the two leaders have been of intense interest and speculation given the evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.", "authors": ["Ivan Nechepurenko"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/world/27russia/27russia-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
