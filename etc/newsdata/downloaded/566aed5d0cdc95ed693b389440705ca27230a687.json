September 8, 2017 was the date of the inaugural encounter in La Liga - which saw it become the first and only derby to be played out in every Spanish league.\n\nApart from Betis and Sevilla, no two teams are closer than Leganes and Getafe anywhere in Spain.\n\nJust three miles separate the clubs in neighbouring towns on the fringes of the capital - Leganes' Burtaque stadium can even be seen from Getafe's on the other side of the Toledo motorway.\n\nGetafe and Leganes have always been competitors on and off the pitch, their rivalry dating back as early as the 1920s, when both sides were playing in the regional divisions.\n\nLeganes fans display a banner behind the goal ahead of their derby match last season\n\nThis was very much a local affair back then that dominated the talk in local shops and factories.\n\nIt was a game that was sometimes brutal and would literally be played on gravel pitches between players with day jobs.\n\nThe thought that both clubs could ever reach the heights of Spain's top division, and be there at the same time, was always seen as fanciful.\n\nGetafe were founded in 1923 (although they were twice refounded, in 1946 and 1983) and Leganes in 1928, but only in the last decade has the idea become plausible.\n\nSince Getafe were refounded 36 years ago, the two clubs have largely been operating on different levels.\n\nGetafe climbed from the lowest tier to reach La Liga for the first time in 2004, while Leganes were relegated to the Segunda B division - Spain's third tier - the same year.\n\nGetafe and Leganes have risen up the leagues and understand what the derby means to fans\n\nThe fact Leganes had even got to the second division was seen as a huge achievement in itself - they hadn't got that high until 1993.\n\nGetafe remained in the top-flight for 14 years and were playing Bayern Munich in Europe while Leganes' south Madrid derby for that season was against Getafe's B team.\n\nThey had played each other in Segunda Regional, Primera Regional, Tercera, Segunda B, and Segunda, but La Liga always seemed off the cards.\n\nEspecially when fate intervened in 2016. As Leganes secured their first-ever promotion to the top-flight, Getafe were relegated after 14 years in the league.\n\nBut the following season, Leganes staved off relegation by the skin of their teeth while Getafe earned promotion back to La Liga.\n\nAnd so, in 2017, the match dubbed the el derbi historico finally graced the top-flight, ending in a 2-1 win for Getafe.\n\nLeganes's Ivan Cuellar and Getafe CF's Amath Ndiaye clash during the south Madrid derby\n\nThere was no derby at all for 13 years between 2004 and 2017, yet somehow it was always there.\n\nLike any derby, it has grown into something more meaningful than a rivalry derived on geographical coincidence.\n\nAfter all, there is no rivalry in Spain that has come this far - Getafe and Leganes hadn't even crossed paths in the second division until the 1990s.\n\nOn paper, Saturday's clash is a lower mid-table clash with Getafe currently in 12th and Leganes sitting rock bottom.\n\nIt may not be the biggest derby in La Liga, or even in the vicinity of Madrid, but the supporters of these two clubs knows what this game means to them.\n\n'The derby is one of the most important matches of the year for us,' a Leganes fan told Sportsmail.\n\nLeganes will travel three miles to Getafe for their fifth top-flight meeting on Saturday\n\n'We've seen this game grow and grow and we feel lucky to watch it in the first division now.\n\n'The rivalry is real and people from both places love to go to this game. Both cities are separated by just for one road. We will have 1,000 people heading to the Coliseum on Saturday. This game always has a special atmosphere.'\n\nIt is one of those derbies that even resonates with the players. 'Two cities separated by a few meters; it is beautiful,' Leganes captain Unai Bustinza said this week.\n\n'In everyday life people live in harmony, but on Saturday everyone will defend their colours.'\n\nAnd on the grandest stage again, where it belongs.", "description": "JORDAN SEWARD: The south Madrid derby is a clasico like no other.
