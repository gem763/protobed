I did report it and made my feelings clear. There were rooms facing on to the pool so there was no respite for these poor animals.\n\n\u201cWe walked along one night just to see if we could hear them and were stunned when the security guard was going to let us in. He gestured that he would tap the water and they would come. Of course we declined and again left in tears for these poor animals.\u201d\n\nDolphinariums say they invest in conservation, but the amount spent is often less than 1 per cent of profit, and dolphins bred in captivity are never released into the wild, WAP claimed.\n\nNick Stewart, of WAP, described the industry as \u201csinister\u201d, saying: \u201cDolphins being used as live surfboards, facing large crowds of people day in, day out with loud music and cheering, and enduring a never-ending stream of tourists seeking that perfect selfie is not education, nor is it humane entertainment.\n\n\u201cWhether bred in captivity or captured from the wild by being torn from their mother\u2019s side, these sociable, intelligent animals are imprisoned for life and are reduced to begging clowns performing circus tricks.\n\n\u201cWe need to make this the last generation of dolphins in captivity. The greedy dolphinarium industry has spun a web of lies, portraying themselves as carers, not captors.\u201d\n\nIn the wild dolphins swim in at least 100sq km of ocean, but in tiny barren tanks they may self-mutilate from stress, Mr Stewart said.\n\nWe need to make this the last generation of dolphins in captivity Nick Stewart\n\nAn Expedia spokesperson said the company had taken steps to remove certain wildlife interactions from its sites both in reaction to \u201cquestionable and unsafe\u201d practices but also to feedback from travellers.\n\n\u201cAnd as this cannot be done alone, we continue to work with five global, industry-leading wildlife and animal protection groups to grow our wildlife tourism education portal,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are grateful for the close coordination with these organisations and our goal for the wildlife tourism education portal is to help better inform travellers about animal welfare and wildlife tourism.\n\n\u201cThe portal includes information as to whether an activity involves animal interactions, with a direct link to learn more about wildlife tourism and animal welfare; and broader education around animal welfare and links to participate in the conversation and take action if a traveller is interested.\u201d\n\nThe findings came on the day that WWF revealed the development of dams and illegal gold mining that uses mercury are threatening the survival of river dolphins in the Amazon.\n\nAll samples taken from mammals with satellite tags had high levels of mercury, which pollutes waterways and threatens species, WWF said.", "description": "Travel giant Expedia is profiting from the suffering of hundreds of captive dolphins forced to entertain holidaymakers, a report has claimed.
