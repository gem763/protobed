(AP) - The Oakland Raiders have brought back undrafted rookie receiver Keelan Doss to fill the spot on the roster created after Antonio Brown\u2019s release.\n\nDoss was signed off Jacksonville\u2019s practice squad on Monday, just hours before the Raiders played their season opener against Denver.\n\nDoss grew up just minutes away from the Raiders facility in Alameda and had an impressive training camp and preseason after being undrafted out of UC Davis. But he didn\u2019t end up making Oakland\u2019s 53-man roster and chose to sign with the Jaguars practice squad instead of the Raiders.\n\nBut after Brown was released Saturday following a series of confrontations with the team, the Raiders brought Doss back to the organization.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Oakland Raiders have brought back undrafted rookie receiver Keelan Doss to fill the spot on the roster created after Antonio Brown's release.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
