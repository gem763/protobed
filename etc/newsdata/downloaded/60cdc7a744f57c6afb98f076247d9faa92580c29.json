We are however sympathetic to animal welfare and environmental concerns with a number of the guideline panel members having eliminated or reduced their personal red and processed meat intake for these reasons.\u201d\n\nHowever, some health professionals have raised concerns about the study, saying it\u2019s sending the wrong message. \u201cWe\u2019re collectively appalled that this is being pushed in the way that it\u2019s being pushed. It just adds to the confusion for patients,\u201d Elizabeth Klodas, a cardiologist and member of the American College of Cardiology\u2019s nutrition group, told The Washington Post. \u201cThe conclusions are not the conclusions of the medical community. They were selective in the studies included and the weight they gave them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe eat 220 pounds of meat per person per year in this country,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s 15 servings a week. And you\u2019re going to tell Americans, just keep going? Today we\u2019re spending $315 billion per year treating heart disease; on our current trajectory, it will be nearly $800 billion by 2035.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at The Washington Post", "description": "A new study suggests there's no need for people to cut back on their red meat consumption, but some doctors and nutritionists disagree.", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/meat-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
