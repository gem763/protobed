The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump\u2019s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country.\n\nIn an interview, WinRed's president, Gerrit Lansing, said the Democrats\u2019 moves to ramp up impeachment efforts against Trump \u201chelped a lot,\u201d saying fundraising numbers \u201cspiked\u201d after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement of a formal inquiry last week.\n\nWinRed has raised over $11.8 million from over 237,000 contributors since the announcement from Pelosi, D-Calif., he said.\n\n\u201cIt just poured gas on the situation where there is a ton of money being raised in all levels and all campaigns,\u201d Lansing said.\n\nThe platform has been off to a stronger start than the Democrats\u2019 version which launched in 2004. FEC records indicated the $30 million raised through WinRed was more than what ActBlue -- the Dems' big online fundraising platform -- raised in its first three and a half years. The records showed that ActBlue raised $99,000 in its first quarter of operations from June to August 2004.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN, GOP RAKE IN MILLIONS IN 24 HOURS AFTER PELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\n\u201cThey were starting in a position that didn\u2019t have all the party behind it,\u201d Lansing said of ActBlue. \u201cThe DNC wasn\u2019t on ActBlue until several years ago. Hillary and Obama weren\u2019t on ActBlue,\u201d he said, referring to former President Obama and ex-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut, ActBlue has grown into a fundraising behemoth since then: it raised $246 million in the second fundraising quarter of this year.\n\nLansing said WinRed has benefitted from top Republican campaigns and organizations embracing it from the beginning. WinRed launched in late June, and this was the platform\u2019s first full fundraising quarter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting off with a big bang where everyone\u2019s on it, everyone\u2019s excited about, and I think it reflects in that big number in our first three months,\u201d he said.\n\nThose running WinRed were hoping to raise $20-25 million this quarter but blew through it after last week\u2019s impeachment drama. The days leading up to the end of the quarter \u2013 when campaigns would ramp up fundraising appeals \u2013 also could see increases in donations. WinRed had over 601,000 donations this quarter.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cImpeachment helped a lot with that,\u201d Lansing said.\n\nRepublicans have boasted of increased fundraising in the wake of the impeachment inquiry announcement. Officials said the Trump campaign, along with the RNC, brought in $5 million in the 24 hours after Pelosi\u2019s announcement. National Republican Congressional Committee officials also said its online fundraising soared by 608 percent on the day Pelosi announced the inquiry.", "description": "WinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete with Democrats\u00a0in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations, has raised over $28 million since launching three months ago, with top officials crediting the Democrats\u2019\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b impeachment push for a big spike in fundraising over the last week, Fox News has learned.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/30/694940094001_6090747435001_6090742312001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
