Really I think we created more chances than them, the better chances, but tonight we didn\u2019t achieve the efficiency to win that match.\n\n\u2018We conceded more corners to them than we wanted, and from one they scored. Also, when they are pushing and they are taking a lot of corners, they can do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We created more corners, 12 [compared to] seven or eight for them, and also we had the chances and had a very clear penalty to Sokratis.\u2019\n\nOdds on which teams will finish in the top four of the Premier League According to Betfair Exchange, the odds are: Man City \u2013 1/100 Chelsea \u2013 4/6 Arsenal \u2013 6/5 Tottenham \u2013 15/8 Leicester \u2013 12/5 Man United \u2013 4/1 Wolves \u2013 21/1 Everton \u2013 33/1 West Ham \u2013 39/1\n\nSince the Arsenal vs Sheffield United match, Ian Wright has criticised head coach Unai Emery\u2019s choice to drop Dani Ceballos to the bench, telling Premier League Productions: \u2018I think he\u2019s got to come here and Ceballos has to play. He\u2019s played the youngsters and I\u2019m pleased to see them in there, with Saka.\n\n\u2018But Saka, for an 18-year-old, if you\u2019re leaving Ozil totally out of the squad, then we have to see more from him [Saka], we have to see more from Joe.\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, it was a game where it passed them both by and then it comes down to the manager and his choices.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMeanwhile, former Manchester United captain Patrice Evra slammed the team, called the Gunners \u2018my babies\u2019 after the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, Evra said: \u2018Sheffield United deserved the win, but I\u2019m not surprised about Arsenal. I said before the game that they had to make sure they didn\u2019t fall into the trap.\n\n\u2018I used to call them \u2018my babies\u2019 10 years ago, and they are still when I look at them and think they are \u2018my babies\u2019 and that\u2019s the truth \u2013 I\u2019m not being disrespectful when I say that.\n\n\u2018They look pretty, but they don\u2019t look like a winning team. They like playing good football, but I was so happy to play against them, because I knew I was going to win.\n\n\u2018Even when Robin van Persie came, and on the first day I shook his hand, and I said \u201cWelcome to a man club\u201d. At the beginning he was upset, but after one month he said \u201cYou were completely right Patrice.\u201d\n\n\u2018Guuendouzi was paying in midfield, but before he was playing in the French second league and he was not even playing regularly \u2013 and he\u2019s the best player in this team.\n\n\u2018I respect Aubameyang and Lacazette, but if those two guys don\u2019t score, they\u2019re in trouble.\u2019\n\nWhen asked about Evra\u2019s comments, Arsenal team captain Granit Xhaka replied: \u2018A lot of people speak too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have a lot of respect for him because he was a great player, but you have to be careful what you say.\n\n\u2018He knows what these situations well, but it\u2019s not only him. A lot of people speak a lot of bulls*** and it\u2019s always the same.\n\n\u2018For me it\u2019s strange because they [ex-footballers] have been in the same situation as us \u2013 maybe it was sometimes good, sometimes not so good.\n\n\u2018But like I said, if you speak bulls*** like this every weekend, then what they say doesn\u2019t get respected.\u2019\n\nMORE: Sheffield United 1-0 Arsenal: Lys Mousset strikes from close-range to down Gunners", "description": "The latest odds on who will make it into the Premier League top four after Arsenal's defeat against Sheffield United Monday night...", "authors": ["Aidan Milan"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177451857_1571747875.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
