Issues that may also be unnerving consumers include the debate around the lack of response of fiscal policy to the deteriorating outlook.\"\n\nDomestic economy a concern too\n\nConsumer expectations for the economy recorded big falls. Expectations around what the economy would be like in the next 5 years plunged 9.1 per cent, while expectations of what the economy will be like in the next 12 months dropped by 6 per cent.\n\nOne of the key readings - whether it is time to buy major household items fell by 4.2 per cent, while the time to buy a dwelling index dropped 5.4 per cent.\n\nThe only households to show an increase in consumer confidence during the month was those with incomes of between $40,000 to $60,000 whose index picked up marginally from 90.6 points to 91 points.\n\nThere were also some positive signs in the labour market with consumers\u2019 job loss fears receding slightly. The unemployment expectations index declined 1.3 per cent to 131.8 in October.\n\nA lower readings indicate that more consumers expect unemployment to fall in the year ahead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd expectations on house prices also continued to lift, rising 5.9 per cent in October, up 54.4 per cent since May.\n\nShadow Treasuer Jim Chalmers said the poor consumer confidence reading meant the government was out of touch on what it needed to do to boost economic growth.\n\n\"This shows that Australians are worried about economy. Scott Morrison and Josh frydenberg are out of touch. Australians are losing confidence rapidly. We call on the government to do something about this floundering consumer confidence.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning Mr Chalmers met with Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe and APRA chairman Wayne Byres to discuss the economy.\n\n\"I met with Phil Lowe and Wayne Byers and [have been] dealing with some of these issues on consumer confidence. I don't want to go into the details of those private conversations. But my view is that the government should not be leaving the heavy lifting to the Reserve Bank.\"\n\n\"If Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg had a plan for the economy the Reserve Bank wouldn't have had to cut rates to below 1 per cent.\"\n\n\"We have played a constructive role in suggesting how the government could lift the economy.\"\n\n\"We have suggested the government could bring forward part of its own tax cuts, or infrastructure spending, business investment, a wages policy and a settled energy policy.\"\n\nCommonwealth Bank economist Belinda Allen said that while consumers had been subjected to negative newsflow on the economy, their lack of confidence could create a downward spiral.\n\n\"Persistently weak consumer sentiment does raise the risk that we do not see an ongoing lift in consumer spending,\" Ms Allen said.\n\n\"The mortgager has experienced the largest fall in sentiment despite being the largest beneficiary of lower interest rates.\"", "description": "Consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level in more than four years as people start to worry about why the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates three times this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3285%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_428%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/56a045afdc5d7a510d4f729e5419a203ca4f4d03", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
