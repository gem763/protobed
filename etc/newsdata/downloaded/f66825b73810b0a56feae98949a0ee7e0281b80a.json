However, this increase in privacy would likely make it more difficult for researchers and, crucial to the U.S. Department of Justice, law enforcement to analyse the information being sent across Zuckerberg\u2019s vast digital empire.\n\n\u201cRisks to public safety from Facebook\u2019s proposals are exacerbated in the context of a single platform that would combine inaccessible messaging services with open profiles, providing unique routes for prospective offenders to identify and groom our children,\u201d the draft reads, according to Buzzfeed. \u201cSecurity enhancements to the virtual world should not make us more vulnerable in the physical world.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department and other U.S. law enforcement agencies have long sought to limit the spread of strong encryption or force tech firms to build in \u201cbackdoor\u201d access, which would effectively negate the privacy and security the technology provides because a \u201cbackdoor\u201d is just a weakness anyone who finds the vulnerability can exploit.\n\nThe war over encryption percolated into the mainstream in 2015, when the FBI demanded Apple break the encryption on a terrorist\u2019s iPhone. This time, as the reported Barr letter exemplifies, the Justice Department is pushing the simplistic narrative that \u201cencryption is dangerous for kids.\u201d\n\nIn its present form, the letter \u2014 which was reportedly co-signed by the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, UK Home Secretary and Australian Minister for Home Affairs \u2014 asks Facebook to put a pin in end-to-end until it can alleviate these agencies\u2019 concerns.\n\nIn response to the leaked draft letter, a Facebook spokesperson told Gizmodo that the company will still comply with applicable laws, but that it \u201cstrongly oppose[s]\u201d efforts to build backdoors into its encryption technology. The full statement reads as follows:\n\n\u201cWe believe people have the right to have a private conversation online, wherever they are in the world. As the US and UK governments acknowledge, the CLOUD Act allows for companies to provide available information when they receive valid legal requests and does not require companies to build backdoors. We respect and support the role law enforcement has in keeping people safe. Ahead of our plans to bring more security and privacy to our messaging apps, we are consulting closely with child safety experts, governments and technology companies and devoting new teams and sophisticated technology so we can use all the information available to us to help keep people safe [...] We strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.\u201d\n\nEncrypted messaging is the second major Facebook announcement the U.S. government has raised serious concerns about \u2014 the first being Libra, a digital currency announced in June, which was met with almost immediate scepticism from lawmakers.\n\nThe DoJ is in the midst of a wide-reaching antitrust probe against major tech firms, Facebook chief among them. Linking its platforms through interoperable messaging \u2014 encrypted or not \u2014 is widely believed to be a strategy meant to resist potential antitrust enforcement.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth considering how much longer Barr might hold his current office, given his level of involvement in Trump\u2019s recent activities with Ukraine (and Italy? And China???), which triggered an impeachment inquiry.", "description": "U.S. Attorney General and Droopy Dog impersonator William Barr is set to request Facebook halt its expected expansion of encrypted messaging through its networks, according to a draft of a letter obtained by Buzzfeed and expected to publish tomorrow....", "authors": ["David Nield", "David Tracy"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/upxvc5dlkylfgk1nw1hd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
