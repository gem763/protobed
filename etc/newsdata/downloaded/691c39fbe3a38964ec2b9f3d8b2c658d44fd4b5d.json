But protesters remained defiant, and at about 9.30pm police fired the first round of tear gas.\n\nThat led to a game of a cat-and-mouse, with protesters splintering off as police advanced and regrouping after officers moved away.\n\nTear gas used to disperse anti-government protesters in Yuen Long.

A No 1 alarm occurred at the committee\u2019s address at around 10.30pm, according to the fire service. At about 11.45pm, riot police fired tear gas as a protester threw a suspected petrol bomb on the ground near Hong Lok Road Light Rail stop.\n\nA cardboard box with wires and a device on the top was left on Light Rail tracks, but police said they had no information on any reports of suspected bombs in Yuen Long by midnight.\n\nDozens of riot police remained on the streets into the early hours of Tuesday for a dispersal operation. Several people were detained over the course of the evening, including a white-clad man who was bleeding from the head.\n\nSenior Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah, of the organised crime and triad bureau, denied police had been dragging their feet in the investigation. Li said on Monday that 34 men, aged between 18 and 60, had been arrested in connection with the July 21 attack. Six had been charged with rioting.\n\nMinor scuffles also reportedly broke out between protesters and some pro-government residents on Monday night. Riot police stepped in and separated the two groups.\n\nThe chaotic scenes in Yuen Long contrasted with a largely peaceful \u201ccommemorative\u201d sit-in at Yoho Mall, a shopping arcade linked to the Yuen Long MTR station.\n\nProtesters take part in a rally at Yolo Mall in Yeun Long marking the third month anniversary of the Yuen Long attack on 21 July 2019.

But the station closed at 2pm, with riot police starting to take over.\n\nThe mall also closed early, at 5pm, and shops shuttered. Scores of protesters, many of whom were dressed in black and wore masks, sat on the floor of the mall\u2019s atrium from 7pm. One protester sprayed graffiti on the floor, reading: \u201cDo not forget July 21. In three months, how many have been arrested?\u201d\n\nElsewhere, protesters staged sit-ins in the evening to mark the attack, including at Tuen Mun, Causeway Bay, Tseung Kwan O, Mong Kok and Tai Koo MTR stations. They were largely peaceful.\n\nAnti-government protesters gathered in Causeway Bay.

They also chanted slogans and sang protest songs, including Glory to Hong Kong. A passer-by who supported their action told them: \u201cAdd oil, be careful and please stay safe.\u201d\n\nChan, 35, who works in the education sector and joined in the sit-in after work, said she had not trusted the police force since the attack in Yuen Long. \u201cWe want to send a message to police, that Hong Kong citizens haven\u2019t forgotten about what happened on July 21,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat are the 5 demands? What do protesters want?\n\nAnother protester, in his 30s, said he had planned to join the sit-in at Yuen Long station but since it was closed, went to the one in Causeway Bay instead. He said he wanted to express anger towards the MTR\u2019s handling of the incident, as well as its recent early closure of stations.\n\n\u201cThe MTR had changed its stance towards protesters since July 21,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had a 180-degree change and became a tool for the government after state media slammed them [for helping protesters].\u201d\n\nAt Mong Kok station, nearly 100 people joined the sit-in. Many wore masks. A passer-by gave them a thumbs-up as some chanted slogans including \u201cTake the bus, boycott the MTR\u201d.", "description": "Meanwhile, peaceful sit-ins also took place in other areas of the city, such as Causeway Bay and Mong Kok.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/fed291e0-f3ff-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires073152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
