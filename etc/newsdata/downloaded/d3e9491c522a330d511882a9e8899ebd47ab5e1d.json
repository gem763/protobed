The White House and State Department had ordered them not to appear.\n\n\n\nKent also said that acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, picked the officials who would handle Ukraine policy after the sitting ambassador had been abruptly recalled.\n\n\n\n\"Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine, who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of US policy in promoting the rule of law in Ukraine. And that was wrong. He used that word, 'wrong',\" Connolly said of Kent.\n\n\n\nTwo of those officials, US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, a special representative for Ukraine, worked with Giuliani to pressure Ukrainian officials to launch investigations that could benefit Trump, according to communications provided to the committee. Volker resigned his post in late September. Sondland is due to testify later in the week in response to a congressional subpoena. Kent said yesterday he was told to \"lay low\" and allow Sondland, Volker and energy secretary Rick Perry to handle Ukraine, the men known by the nickname \"The Three Amigos\", according to Connolly.\n\nJohn Bolton, were also alarmed by Giuliani's interference. Hill said Bolton characterised Giuliani as Lawmakers had already heard from Fiona Hill, Trump's former Russia adviser, who said on Monday she and her then-boss, former national security adviserwere also alarmed by Giuliani's interference. Hill said Bolton characterised Giuliani as \"a hand grenade who is going to blow everybody up\"\n\n\n\nGiuliani had faced a Tuesday deadline to produce the requested documents. His lawyer, Jon Sale, said the documents were protected by legal principles that shield attorney-client communications and presidential communications. \"This appears to be an unconstitutional, baseless, and illegitimate 'impeachment inquiry,'\" Sale wrote, echoing language the White House used last week.\n\n\n\nPence's lawyer, Matthew E Morgan, has also cited the White House's response, saying the House had not voted to authorise the inquiry.\n\n\n\nHere's more on the refuseniks.", "description": "Donald Trump\u00a0has raged about the \u201ctotally illegal & absurd\u201d impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine\u00a0a day after he hosted\u00a0the Stanley Cup-winning ice hockey team the\u00a0St Louis Blues\u00a0in the White House Rose Garden and asked them\u00a0sarcastically: \u201cWe just hit the greatest economy we\u2019ve ever had.
