Viewers cheered for Honey when she eventually confronted Habiba last night but as the pressure mounted on her, some worrying signs came to light which made viewers fear that Honey could be struggling with an eating disorder.\n\nAs well as having a crisis of self confidence and image issues, thinking that she isn\u2019t good enough due to Adam\u2019s behaviour, she left her meal half way through and was seen anxiously brushing her teeth while trying to bottle up her true feelings during a family dinner.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly where the storyline will go but a recent trailer showed Mariam telling Billy that he is the right man for Honey, suggesting that Adam\u2019s infidelity might soon become public knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has been confirmed that Stephen is leaving the show as the cheating dentist in coming scenes so it is inevitable that Honey\u2019s relationship will fall apart. But will this serve to impact her self esteem more and make her symptoms worse?\n\nEastEnders are not currently commenting on the storyline speculation but fans have taken to social media to share their fears for Honey.\n\nanyone else think honey may have an eating disorder? #EastEnders \u2014 \u0142 (@janinesbutcher) October 8, 2019\n\nI think theyre doing an eating disorder storyline with Honey.
