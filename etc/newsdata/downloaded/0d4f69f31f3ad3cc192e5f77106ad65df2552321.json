The report alleged some NRA members used a 2015 NRA trip to Moscow for their own personal business reasons rather than for tax-exempt purposes. Misuse of tax-exempt funding for private gain would violate tax laws.\n\n\u201cGiven this report\u2019s concerning findings and other allegations of potential violations of tax exempt law by the NRA, it is incumbent on the IRS to fully investigate the organization\u2019s activities to determine whether the NRA\u2019s tax exemption should be disallowed,\u201d Schumer and Wyden wrote.\n\nThe issue also matters for U.S. elections and national security, they said.\n\nThe NRA refuted the findings in Wyden\u2019s report, as did Senate Republican investigators who said none of the material calls into question the NRA\u2019s tax exemption.\n\nAn attorney for the NRA said today that the report \"is being used to justify yet another politically motivated investigation into the NRA.\"\n\n\u201cThe exercise should raise concerns about an abuse of government power and waste of taxpayer funds,\" said William A.
