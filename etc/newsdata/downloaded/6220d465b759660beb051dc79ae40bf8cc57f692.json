The phone can be purchased in a veritable rainbow of colors; why hide it under a leather or plastic case that hides it?\n\nIt's also available for the larger, pricier iPhone 11 Pro, which doesn't come in the same array of flashy colors, but might still be worth showing off anyway.\n\nThe case retails for $39 and can currently be ordered online for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nThe cases are made from a blend of flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) materials and clear polycarbonate with a scratch-resistant coating, both of which should prevent yellowing, according to Apple.\n\nThe back of the case is designed to be firm, but the sides are flexible to fit over the buttons and improve grip, also according to Apple.\n\nCheck out Apple's clear iPhone case in action, on every color of iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro:", "description": "The cases are made from a blend of flexible TPU materials and clear polycarbonate with scratch-resistant coating, according to Apple.", "authors": ["Rebecca Aydin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d78114b2e22af1d96202cd8-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
