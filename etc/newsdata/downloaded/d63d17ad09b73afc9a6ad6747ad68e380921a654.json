She may not know much about the conversation.\n\nTrump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky triggered the unfolding impeachment investigation.\n\nIt is unclear if the White House will block Hill, now a private citizen, from testifying.\n\n\u201cThe White House has opted to use executive privilege to stop officials from testifying before Congress, but it remains legally unclear if the president can force former officials who are now private citizens from testifying,\u201d the Hill noted.\n\nIn a recent letter to House Democrat leaders, the White House said it would not cooperate with the impeachment probe. The move suggests the White House may try to block current and former officials from testifying.\n\nHill, described as a staunch anti-Russia hawk, was not viewed as a Trump loyalist. She worked with former British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the infamous, largely discredited anti-Trump dossier that detailed the president\u2019s alleged ties to Russia.\n\nThe controversial Fusion GPS firm hired Steele to compile the \u201cpee dossier\u201d on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNS) and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Steele\u2019s dossier was reportedly at the center of the Russia collusion hoax investigation by Robert Mueller.\n\nIn late September, Politico reported:\n\nHill also hailed from the Brookings Institution, the epitome of the D.C. establishment Trump had pointedly rejected. And she was recruited by K.T. McFarland and Michael Flynn, who were out as Trump\u2019s top two national security officials before Hill even formally started. She had even worked with Christopher Steele, the British ex-spymaster behind the salacious dossier that rocked the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency. National security insiders were shocked when she took the job\u2014she was anything but a Trump loyalist (her colleagues weren\u2019t even sure whether she was a conservative) and the Trump-Russia probe was gaining steam and in the headlines daily.\n\nStill, the former top Russia aide left the administration on \u201cgood terms,\u201d Politico noted.\n\nShe \u201chelped craft responses to Russia\u2019s malign behavior that, to many experts, are arguably even tougher than those imposed by the Obama administration,\u201d it added.\n\nHill will testify Monday that \u201cshe was unaware of some aspects of the escalating Ukraine scandal,\u201d CNN reported Friday, citing an anonymous source.\n\nShe is expected to tell congressional investigators that Trump\u2019s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and his associates pursued a \u201cshadow policy on Ukraine,\u201d bypassing the NSC, NBC News added, noting:\n\nFiona Hill, who was until recently President Donald Trump\u2019s top aide on Russia and Europe, plans to tell Congress that Rudy Giuliani and E.U. ambassador Gordon Sondland circumvented the National Security Council and the normal White House process to pursue a shadow policy on Ukraine, a person familiar with her expected testimony told NBC News. Hill\u2019s appearance next week before Congress has stoked fear among people close to the president, said a former senior White House official, given her central role overseeing Russia and Ukraine policy throughout most of the Trump administration.\n\nThe House Democrat chairmen conducting the impeachment inquiry have not subpoenaed Hill, NBC News pointed out.\n\nIn a letter sent to Hill on October 9, the Democrat committee chairmen pursuing the impeachment probe reportedly warned the former Russia aide:\n\nYour failure or refusal to appear at the deposition or produce the requested documents, including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against the president.\n\nThe House panel chairmen \u2014 Adam Schiff (D-CA), Eliot Engel (D-NY), and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) \u2014 are requesting Ukraine-linked documents from Hill dating back to January 20, 2017, the day Trump was inaugurated as president.\n\nThe chairmen subpoenaed Sondland after Trump blocked him from testifying. Sondland is expected to give his deposition next week.", "description": "Trump's former top aide on Russia and Europe, Fiona Hill, is expected to appear Monday for a private deposition in an impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Fiona-Hill-Apr2-2019-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
