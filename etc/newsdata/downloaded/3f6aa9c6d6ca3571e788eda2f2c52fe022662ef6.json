The vote was 403 to 16, with 15 Republicans and one Democrat, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, voting against the legislation.\n\nThis month, two-thirds of House Republicans joined with Democrats to censure his withdrawal of troops from Syria in a 354 to 60 vote. It was, at the time, the most significant bipartisan repudiation of Mr. Trump since he took office.\n\nThe top Democrat and Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee \u2014 Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the chairman, and Representative Michael McCaul of Texas \u2014 sponsored the legislation that passed Tuesday, which is an attempt by lawmakers to add teeth to what they consider an insufficient response from the Trump administration to Turkey\u2019s bloody offensive into Syria. If enacted, it would prohibit the sale of arms to Turkey for use in Syria, impose sanctions on senior Turkish officials for their role in the military offensive against the Kurds, and require the administration to impose additional sanctions for the Turkish government\u2019s purchase of surface-to-air missile systems from Russia.", "description": "House Republicans broke from President Trump en masse for a second time this month to condemn his foreign policy in Syria.", "authors": ["Catie Edmondson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/us/politics/29dc-sanctions/29dc-sanctions-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
