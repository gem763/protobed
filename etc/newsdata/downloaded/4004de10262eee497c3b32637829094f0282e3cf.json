So discovering that I could sew my own was profoundly freeing \u2013 and led me to help curvy women all over the world\n\nIf you had told me when I was 29 that in 10 years time I would have made my entire wardrobe, run a sewing pattern company and finally found peace with my body, I would have said that was impossible. But learning to sew a simple pillow started a journey that blossomed into a total life transformation.\n\nEver since I was a toddler in ballet class being told off for having a sticky-out tummy, I have been on the bigger side. No matter how many diets I tried, or sit-ups I did, I stayed stubbornly chubby, even if I had brief forays into being a smaller clothes size. By the time I was a teenager, I was resigned to it: not only did I feel like an unattractive failure for being a size 16 at 16 years old (how I laugh now at the idea that that is huge), but there was also no way I would be able to dress as I wanted to, despite the fact I loved clothes, because there simply weren\u2019t clothes I liked in my size in the shops.\n\nOf course, my size wasn\u2019t the only thing that defined me. An enthusiastic adopter of hobbies, I was creative from a young age, always starting up a new art or craft. So, when I was looking for a new challenge when I turned 30, I thought I would learn to sew. I vividly remember the first lesson I took, making a \u201crustic\u201d pillow \u2013 as I sewed the first seam, I caught the bug. Before long, I was spending every evening and weekend learning new techniques; soon I was trying to make my own clothes, as I had the exciting idea that maybe I could make things that fitted.\n\nImagine my disappointment, then, when I found out that, just as so many clothing shops ended at a size 16, so did most sewing patterns. Plus, they tended to be made for a B-cup bra and I was much bigger than that. So, I had to learn to alter patterns to fit me, mastering the complex \u201cfull bust adjustment\u201d and learning how to make a single garment with different sizes at the bust, waist and hips. It took a long time to refine my alteration skills, but once I did I could create any garment, in any fabric, in any style \u2013 and it would fit me.\n\nLearning this skill of changing my clothes to fit my body, rather than changing my body to fit my clothes, was profoundly freeing: from the constant internal narrative I had when I was in a changing room willing a size 14 to fit; from having to wear what other people had decided was suitable for someone my size; from being assigned a number that was meant to dictate my worth as a person. I realised I had been tormenting myself to fit into an \u201caverage\u201d that had never existed. It became evident that, contrary to what I had always believed, anyone can wear anything, as long as it fits. There is no magic rule that says when women hit a size 16 they no longer want to wear silk dresses, biker jackets, swimsuits or crop tops. All you need is enough fabric and sewing and fitting skills \u2013 then anything is possible. I learned that there was nothing inherently wrong with my body, and trying on only clothes that were custom-made for me was total bliss.\n\nSewing my clothes is an escape from fashion\u2019s dictates. I no longer hate my body | Jenny Rushmore Read more\n\nStill, I was frustrated that I had to make so many alterations to every sewing pattern \u2013 and I knew I wasn\u2019t alone, because the average UK woman is a size 16 and a DD cup size. So, one night, about four years after I learned to sew, I had an idea that would change my life again: I was going to help other curvy women experience the body positivity transformation I had, by creating sewing patterns that were designed for our size and body shape \u2013 no adjustments required.\n\nA year later, I launched Cashmerette Patterns with the Appleton dress, a wrap dress that doesn\u2019t gape at the bust, that comes in sizes 16 to 32 and in cup sizes C to H. It turned out I was right: so many other women felt alienated by sewing patterns, and being able to whip up a dress \u201cstraight out of the packet\u201d was not only convenient but also liberating. Since then, I have quit my job to run Cashmerette full-time. We have more than 20 patterns, from simple T-shirts and a swimsuit with a full underwired bra inside, to a shirt that doesn\u2019t gape at the buttons. They are sold all over the world.\n\nMy 29-year-old self would be astonished to see what my life looks like now, but I know she would be proud and perhaps a little overwhelmed to know how much I have changed and how I have been able to help other women like me. Learning to sew changed almost every facet of my life, and I will always be grateful to the small cushion that opened my mind to what was possible.", "description": "As a teenager, the styles I liked never came in my size.
