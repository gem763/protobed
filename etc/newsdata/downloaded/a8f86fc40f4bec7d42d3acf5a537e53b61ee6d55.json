However, he denied any \u201cbusiness relationship or friendship\u201d with Epstein, who died by suicide while in jail awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. Gates also denied he was ever \u201cat any parties or anything like that\u201d with Epstein, with a spokesperson also saying that Epstein never \u201cdirected any programmatic or personal grantmaking for Bill Gates.\u201d\n\nNow, per the Times, sources and documents say that Gates met with Epstein on \u201cnumerous occasions \u2014 including at least three times at Mr. Epstein\u2019s palatial Manhattan townhouse, and at least once staying late into the night.\u201d The Times also reported that Gates\u2019 employees went on \u201cmultiple visits\u201d to Epstein\u2019s property and that Epstein pitched Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and JPMorgan Chase on a \u201cmultibillion-dollar charitable fund,\u201d which could have resulted in Epstein picking up \u201cenormous fees\u201d in the tens of millions.\n\nBill Gates Explains He Met With Jeffrey Epstein Because Epstein Knew 'a Lot Of Rich People' On Tuesday, CNBC reported that Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates met with late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2013 after Epstein \u201cunleashed an aggressive lobbying campaign\u201d to secure that meeting. In an interview published on Wednesday, Gates offered his explanation of why to the Wall Street Journal: Epstein knew a lot of rich people! Read more\n\nThe first meeting was on Jan. 31, 2011, when Gates met with Epstein, former Miss Sweden Dr. Eva Andersson-Dubin (spouse of billionaire hedge funder Glenn Dubin), and the Dubins\u2019 15-year-old daughter. At the time, Epstein\u2019s reputation was a convicted sex offender was well-known. That gathering started at 8pm and lasted hours, with the Times reporting that Gates wrote to colleagues the next day, \u201cA very attractive Swedish woman and her daughter dropped by and I ended up staying there quite late.\u201d That year, Gates was also seen talking privately with Epstein at a TED conference in California and visited Epstein again at his New York mansion with others, including then-senior JPMorgan exec James E. Stanley and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.\n\nAround that time, sources told the paper, Epstein was pitching both the Gates Foundation and JPMorgan on beginning a charitable fund to operate in tandem with the two institutions\u2019 Global Health Investment Fund. In late 2011, Gates\u2019 employees met with Epstein at Gates\u2019 instruction, with sources telling the paper he said his shady 2007 plea deal and conviction was no worse than \u201cstealing a bagel.\u201d\n\nAt one point in 2011, Gates wrote in an email that Epstein\u2019s \u201clifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me,\u201d the Times wrote.\n\nIn March 2013, Gates flew on Epstein\u2019s jet from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to Palm Beach, Florida, and six months later met Epstein in New York for dinner and a discussion on philanthropy. Finally, in October 2014, Gates donated $US2 million ($3 million) to the MIT Media Lab, whose director Joichi Ito resigned this year after his extensive financial ties to Epstein became public news. The New Yorker reported that Media Lab staff recorded the donation as directed by Epstein, but kept Epstein\u2019s name anonymous, writing in records that \u201cGates is making this gift at the recommendation of a friend of his who wishes to remain anonymous.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s proposed charitable fund never became reality, and Gates seemed to have stopped engaging with him after 2014, though former foundation employees told the Times that \u201cat least two senior Gates Foundation officials\u201d remained in contact with the financier until 2017.\n\nNote that one of the Gates Foundation\u2019s biggest missions is gender equality and empowering women and girls. Earlier this month, Melinda Gates announced that she was committing $US1 ($1.5 billion) billion over the next 10 years towards \u201cexpanding women\u2019s power and influence in the United States.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Times, a spokesperson for Gates said \u201cBill Gates regrets ever meeting with Epstein and recognises it was an error in judgment to do so. Gates recognises that entertaining Epstein\u2019s ideas related to philanthropy gave Epstein an undeserved platform that was at odds with Gates\u2019s personal values and the values of his foundation... Over time, Gates and his team realised Epstein\u2019s capabilities and ideas were not legitimate and all contact with Epstein was discontinued.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson also said the email Gates wrote was, of course, only \u201creferring only to the unique d\u00e9cor of the Epstein residence.\u201d", "description": "Billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates had a much closer relationship with late financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein than Gates has previously stated, the New York Times reported on Saturday, including multiple visits to Epstein\u2019s now-infamous New York townhouse....", "authors": ["Sam Rutherford", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/mqng9dczteli2rbeavmc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
