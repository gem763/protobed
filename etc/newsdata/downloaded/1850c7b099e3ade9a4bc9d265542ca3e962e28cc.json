As it is, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the data from U.S. Energy Information Administration to show total gas in storage at 106 billion cubic feet at the close of last week, versus the previous week\u2019s tally of 98 bcf.\n\nFleeting Joy For Gas Bulls As Upcoming Weather Not Cold Enough\n\nBut even if gas prices don\u2019t collapse by Friday, the joy for bulls may be fleeting. This is because weather forecasts down the line show temperatures could get milder before they turn colder. That could mean more storage builds and potentially weaker prices.\n\nYet, even in such bearish situations, Henry Hub futures may not break below the key $2 support gas bears are counting on. That\u2019s because intermittent cold over the next couple of weeks could soften the impact of the current highs in gas production. U.S. gas output hit a near record high of 93.1 bcf per day just last week, data showed.\n\nThe surge in gas production has been both delightful and frustrating to bears who shorted the market at around $2.50, hoping for a steady crumble to under $2.\n\n'Strong Sell' Recommendation, But With A Low Above $2\n\nWhile Investing.com has a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d recommendation for natural gas in its Daily Technical Outlook, the near-term bottom it predicts is also above $2, at $2.149.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s settlement, the benchmark contract on Henry Hub settled at $2.303. Barring further slides, the contract could finish up 3.7% on the week.\n\nDan Myers, analyst at gas consultancy Gelber & Associates, laid out the conflicting supply-demand themes in a report he wrote on Wednesday:\n\n\u201cA developing colder-than-normal pattern in the central to eastern U.S. late in October, which will finally bring meaningful heating demand, has led to a corresponding increase in prices this week.\u201d \u201cMeanwhile, futures for December through March haven\u2019t shown as strong of a response as storage still looks to reach comfortable levels before winter truly hits.\u201d\n\nMyers warns that the next two weeks in particular could feature storage additions higher than last year and the five-year average, before stronger heating demand kicks in from late autumn chill.\n\nGas Market In Reverie; 'Major Curveball' Needed\n\nScott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina, makes a similar point:\n\n\u201cBottom line\u2026.production is growing, as is demand, which is why the market isn\u2019t reacting to it.\u201d \u201cThe focus will be on weather until the data throws a major curveball as the current supply-demand suggests that prices should be weaker than $2.50 but not in a free fall under $2.\u201d\n\nShelton estimated that Commodity Trading Advisors, which include hedge funds, were nearing a 80% short position and were closer to covering than adding to their bearish holdings.\n\nHe said prices should be firming soon on the back of a cooler outlook for November. \u201cThe true driver will be CTA short rolling,\u201d he added.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Barani Krishnan/Investing.com covering: Natural Gas Futures.
