Transportation to English-language Catholic schools will be cancelled as a result.\n\nSchools belonging to the two French school boards, the Conseil des \u00e9coles catholiques du Centre-Est (CECCE) and Conseil des \u00e9coles publiques de I'Est de l'Ontario (CEPEO), will remain open Monday.\n\nThat's because, according to statements from the two boards, the strike will not compromise student safety. However, the situation will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOutside of Ottawa, the Upper Canada District School Board (UCDSB) and the Catholic District School Board of Eastern Ontario (CDSBEO) will close their schools should a strike occur, while the Renfrew County District School Board and Renfrew County Catholic District School Board will keep their schools open.\n\nCUPE has given notice that the 55,000 education workers it represents in Ontario will go on strike Monday if no contract deal is reached by midnight on Sunday. (@joetigani/Twitter)\n\nWhat happens to classes if a strike occurs?\n\nThe union bargaining with the province does not represent teachers, so classes are expected to operate as usual at schools that will be staying open.\n\nCUPE represents educational assistants, early childhood educators, office administrators, library technicians, learning technology technicians, full-time adult English-as-a-second-language instructors and a number of central OCSB employees.\n\nHow would a strike affect community groups that use schools?\n\nCatholic school facilities, such as gyms, libraries, cafeterias and classrooms, will remain open to community groups who have a permit to use them.\n\nThe Renfrew County District School Board, however, said it will cancel all community-use permits.\n\nA group of people that included union leaders and parents rallied outside the Toronto venue where Sunday's last-minute contract talks were taking place. (Keith Burgess/CBC)\n\nWhat about child-care programs?\n\nThe OCSB, CECCE, CEPEO and the UCDSB will cancel extended day programs and all child-care programs for kindergarten and school-age children.\n\nHowever, all toddler and preschool programs operated by the Ottawa Catholic Child Care Corporation will not be affected in case of a strike.\n\nWhen will parents be notified?\n\nSchool boards will notify parents through the media, email and their voicemail systems whether or not an agreement is reached.\n\nThe two sides have until midnight Sunday to reach an agreement.\n\nParents have been encouraged to find child care for their children Monday in case of a strike.", "description": "Here's what Ottawa-area parents and students need to know about the looming work stoppage.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311163.1570392130!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ont-cupe-strike-20190916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
