In this special feature, Times Opinion writers rank the candidates on a scale of 1 to 10: 1 means the candidate probably didn\u2019t belong on the stage and should probably drop out; 10 means it\u2019s on, President Trump. Here\u2019s what our columnists and contributors thought about the debate.\n\nSee rankings for the debates on July 31 and Aug. 1.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nGail Collins (9/10) \u2014 Great at bringing things back to the corruption issue and talking about being a public school teacher.\n\nRoss Douthat (6/10) \u2014 Another solid performance overall, but she lost the opening exchange on health care and disappeared entirely for the first hour.\n\nMaureen Dowd (6/10) \u2014 More free stuff and Aunt Bee! Warren\u2019s expertise is appealing in the age of Trump, though, like President Obama, she tends to lecture.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (7/10) \u2014 She\u2019s so good at this, but still hasn't figured out how to address the anxieties a lot of people have about Medicare for All. And it was disappointing that she didn\u2019t get to engage more with Biden, especially on issues like the 2005 bankruptcy bill.\n\nDavid Leonhardt (8/10) \u2014 No Democratic politician today, on that stage or not, is better at communicating economic ideas. She makes them personal and political. Still she\u2019s vulnerable on Medicare for All.\n\nMiriam Pawel (9/10) \u2014 Consistently strong across a range of issues, unruffled by Biden\u2019s attacks on health care, she got stronger as the debate went on \u2014 with points for fortitude and versatility.\n\nMelanye Price (9/10) \u2014 She feels more emotionally authentic and accessible than any other candidate. She gets to the heart of things about educational costs and what it feels like to claw for opportunities when the odds seem stacked against you. While most of the candidates tonight seemed battle weary, she came off as roaring to fight more.\n\nMimi Swartz (7/10) \u2014 She did fine, and maybe that\u2019s all she had to do.\n\nPete Wehner (5/10) \u2014 She was highly evasive on her health care plan and overall she was completely forgettable. Invoking Jay Inslee as a trailblazer mean you\u2019ve by definition had a subpar night. After several good debate performances, she lost altitude in Houston.\n\nWill Wilkinson (8/10) \u2014 She excelled in her allotment with a typical blend of folksy charm, masterful lucidity and passionate corporation bashing.\n\nTanzina Vega (8/10) \u2014 Warren may have a plan for everything but she continued to skirt the question about how much her health care plan would raise taxes on American families. But she is consistent, and at a certain point maybe Democratic voters will also agree that she \"knows what's broken\" and \"how to fix it.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris\n\nGail Collins (5/10) \u2014 Nothing she did made me forget how bad she was last time around.\n\nRoss Douthat (5/10) \u2014 No terrible moments, a few good ones, but nothing to stop her slow fade out of the top tier.\n\nMaureen Dowd (5/10) \u2014 She went all Brechtian and broke the fourth wall to talk directly to President Trump. But it\u2019s hard for her to be commanding while she\u2019s still trying to calibrate her prosecutorial record. She still doesn't have the Vision Thing.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (8/10) \u2014 The direct address to Donald Trump in her opening statement was pretty satisfying and also a clever gambit to get him to attack her. As someone who has kids in elementary school and can\u2019t bear seeing them traumatized by active shooter drills, I found her riff on the subject genuinely powerful and suspect it will resonate with a lot of parents.\n\nDavid Leonhardt (8/10) \u2014 Best opening statement. Her goal was obvious, but it worked: We could imagine her on a stage debating Trump, and doing it well.\n\nMiriam Pawel (5/10) \u2014 She avoided strategic errors (if not factual ones) and avoided weak defensive answers by turning questions into an attack on Trump. She was relaxed and well coached, and laughed a lot at her own jokes.\n\nMelanye Price (6/10) \u2014 She basically focused on Trump all night. Bold, but she\u2019s not running in the general. She can't make that pivot until she quells criticism about her criminal justice record.\n\nMimi Swartz (8/10) \u2014 She was warmer and more relaxed than in previous debates. \u201cSmall dude\u201d joke won the night.\n\nPete Wehner (6/10) \u2014 She decided to cozy up to Barack Obama and aim her fire on Donald Trump. She got off some good lines against him, but it doesn\u2019t help that she laughs a little too hard at her own jokes (especially about \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d).\n\nWill Wilkinson (6/10) \u2014 She was appealingly loose, warm and human \u2014 which made her inability to adequately offer direct answers to her record as a prosecutor all the more notable.\n\nTanzina Vega (6/10) \u2014 She might know how to work the system from the inside but that's exactly what makes left leaning Democrats worried about her. They\u2019re still trying to understand whose side she's really on.\n\nCory Booker\n\nGail Collins (7/10) \u2014 So intense he kind of runs you over.\n\nRoss Douthat (7/10) \u2014 He continues to be the most consistently eloquent and engaging figure on the stage. Maybe one of these days it will help his poll numbers.\n\nMaureen Dowd (4/10) \u2014 Not much of a presence.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (8/10) \u2014 He\u2019s terrific in these debates. During the health care portion, he was able to combine support for the goal of Medicare for All with openness to incremental reform without seeming slippery. I remain baffled about why he hasn\u2019t been able to break out.\n\nDavid Leonhardt (6/10) \u2014 He looked like he was enjoying himself, no small thing in a televised debate. Too many meta comments about what the debate conversation was about.\n\nMiriam Pawel (4/10) \u2014 Again showed himself an articulate, passionate debater and stepped in well to unify the group, but this isn\u2019t going to give him the breakthrough he needs.\n\nMelanye Price (7/10) \u2014 He positions himself as the principled voice of reason, a moral visionary who can preach us into a brighter future. He seemed more like a visionary than anyone might have expected or than his opponents who got bogged down in arguments of the minutiae of health care plans. The problem with his performance is that Democratic voters who want a visionary have already chosen Sanders or Warren.\n\nMimi Swartz (5/10) \u2014 He was eloquent and inspiring, but somehow his message of love and togetherness doesn\u2019t quite elevate him into the first tier.\n\nPete Wehner (7/10) \u2014 He\u2019s been the Democrat\u2019s most consistently impressive debater. He is less angry and more knowledgeable than a lot of the other candidates. He rarely slips up and has the most consistently uplifting message.\n\nWill Wilkinson (7/10) \u2014 He\u2019s tightening his game. He offered excellent answers on gun control and criminal justice. His \"greatest setback\" came off like a humblebrag.\n\nTanzina Vega (5/10) \u2014 He came across as likable but much of his rhetoric was light on actual policy.\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nGail Collins (7/10) \u2014 Not much impact, except when he talked about the military and his personal story.\n\nRoss Douthat (4/10) \u2014 Meh.\n\nMaureen Dowd (5/10) \u2014 Petering out.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (6/10) \u2014 He seemed a little less sharp than in previous debates, but his answer on coming out of the closet as mayor during an election year was humanizing for a candidate who often seems coldly technocratic.\n\nDavid Leonhardt (7/10) \u2014 He makes the best case against the primary\u2019s worst ideas: The problem with mandatory Medicare is that \u201cit doesn't trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you.\"\n\nMiriam Pawel (4/10) \u2014 He had a great finish and it will endure as a memorable moment of the 2020 campaign, but it won\u2019t push him into the top tier.\n\nMelanye Price (3/10) \u2014 His light is fading. There were no real standout moments from him tonight and Castro seemed more like the young wunderkind than Mayor Pete. As a middle-of-the-road candidate, he's in a political vacuum.\n\nMimi Swartz (9/10) \u2014 He acquitted himself extremely well \u2014 gravitas with a sense of humor.\n\nPete Wehner (6/10) \u2014 He needed a breakthrough debate; he didn\u2019t get it. He had some good moments, including making the best case against Medicare for All (trust Americans to choose what\u2019s in their best interest) and his closing statement. But he never found his stride on a night he really needed to.\n\nWill Wilkinson (7/10) \u2014 Mayor Pete seemed low-key, but delivered one impressive answer after another. That still didn't stop his studied gravity and teacher's-favorite mien from putting me off. It's probably just me.\n\nTanzina Vega (8/10) \u2014 Buttigieg\u2019s moving personal account of being a soldier during the era of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and his subsequent coming out, felt like an authentic moment younger voters in particular might empathize with.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\n\nGail Collins (6/10) \u2014 He had one great moment with his passion about gun regulation.\n\nRoss Douthat (4/10) \u2014 Extremely woke, coming-for-your-guns Beto might be an improvement on pointless-waste-of-campaign-dollars Beto. But only a marginal one.\n\nMaureen Dowd (6/10) \u2014 Thank [expletive] God someone finally said it: \u201cHell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nMichelle Goldberg (8/10) \u2014 The other candidates praised his response to the El Paso massacre because they don\u2019t see him as competition, but he had by far his best debate. His impassioned answer on guns was thrilling \u2014 \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15!\u201d That was the version of O\u2019Rourke that made his Senate campaign so inspiring.\n\nDavid Leonhardt (6/10) \u2014 Extra credit for saying that, yes, he wants to take away guns that are designed to kill people.\n\nMiriam Pawel (5/10) \u2014 The home-state favorite found his voice after the El Paso shooting, but one issue gets you only so far \u2014 a strong performance for a Senate launch.\n\nMelanye Price (4/10) \u2014 The biggest fear of N.R.A. members is that the government is coming for their guns. Beto said he would take AK-47s and AR-15s from homes, and that admission will be his undoing. It also makes him unlikely to win a campaign for Senate against John Cornyn. Many hoped he would make the shift. He cannot now.\n\nMimi Swartz (8/10) \u2014 He got so much praise from his fellow candidates! Beto is back!\n\nPete Wehner (4/10) \u2014 He was praised by everyone because he\u2019s viewed as a threat by no one. He\u2019s cloyingly opportunistic and radical, saying out loud (confiscating guns) what Democrats were once unwilling to say.\n\nWill Wilkinson (8/10) \u2014 Beto is coming on strong. The appeal of his Jimmy Carteresque transparency and moral earnestness shined through in his moving and honest answer on gun control.\n\nTanzina Vega (7/10) \u2014 After the El Paso shootings in early August, O'Rourke was forced to take a stand on racism and gun violence and he hasn't backed down on either. He was also the only candidate to say he would support a bill calling for reparations for African Americans.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nGail Collins (8/10) \u2014 Started to garble in the third hour, but nothing terrible happened, so I guess he wins. Sigh.\n\nRoss Douthat (6/10) \u2014 He won the early rounds, but instead of fading his energy spiked too high and he sounded incoherent by the end of the second hour. But any night that offers a chance to talk about grief and setbacks will end up okay for the front-runner.\n\nMaureen Dowd (6/10) \u2014 Status quo is hard to make sexy. The garbled record player remark was a throwback, like Biden himself. But then, vinyl is chic again.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (7/10) \u2014 He tripped over his words several times, but he was clearer and more energetic than in past debates. His \u201cresilience\u201d answer was a reminder of how much suffering he\u2019s endured and his big heart. I hate to say it, since I still think he\u2019ll be weak in a general election, but my guess is he solidified his front-runner status.\n\nDavid Leonhardt (5/10) \u2014 A strong, energetic opening statement, and some good moments, especially the personal reflection. But he also told parents to educate their kids by turning on the record player. And Castro was right that Biden tries to take credit but no blame for Obama policies.\n\nMiriam Pawel (7/10) \u2014 His best performance, though like a 78 r.p.m. on the record player he began to skip a little by the end.\n\nMelanye Price (4/10) \u2014 He was asked about race and racial segregation. Here is what we learned: He married two teachers, is willing to stare down dictators and has seen racial policies change over his long career in politics. We never learned his views on race. This will be his undoing in the African- American electorate.\n\nMimi Swartz (5/10) \u2014 He started out with guns blazing, but by mid-debate he seemed to run out of ammunition.\n\nPete Wehner (6/10) \u2014 He\u2019s never been a great debater, and he\u2019s more gaffe prone now than ever. He started out strong but he faded as the night went on. He\u2019s utterly incomprehensible on Iraq and Afghanistan. Even I\u2019m not sure I remember what a record player is and I worked in the Reagan administration. But Biden\u2019s last answer, speaking about the grievous losses he experienced, was poignant and human.\n\nWill Wilkinson (5/10) \u2014 His defensive aggression obscured his usual genial charm. As the debate stretched on, he became embarrassingly incoherent, and simply lied about his record on Iraq.\n\nTanzina Vega (6/10) \u2014 When it came to race, Biden focused on criminal justice reform, which is only one part of the institutional racism that black and brown Americans are facing today.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nGail Collins (6/10) \u2014 Good health care rant but still too much like a cranky old uncle at Thanksgiving.\n\nRoss Douthat (6/10) \u2014 I keep waiting for him to tweak his pitch a little and try to broaden his appeal, but he's just running as Bernie Sanders \u2014 hoarsely but effectively.\n\nMaureen Dowd (4/10) \u2014 Face it, Elizabeth Warren has stolen your act.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (6/10) \u2014 He seemed shoutier than usual, but I\u2019m glad he got a chance to articulate what he means by democratic socialism.\n\nDavid Leonhardt (6/10) \u2014 We know Bernie by now. He has many charms. I\u2019m not sure how he grows his support among primary voters.\n\nMiriam Pawel (6/10) \u2014 The hoarseness didn\u2019t help and he suffered by being in Warren's shadow, but his message was consistent and health care is still a winning issue\n\nMelanye Price (5/10) \u2014 He seemed exhausted, and it wasn\u2019t his night. But I don\u2019t think he will lose any ground because Bernie loyalists will continue to support him.\n\nMimi Swartz (4/10) \u2014 The hoarseness didn\u2019t help his angry old uncle act.\n\nPete Wehner (5/10) \u2014 Even when he\u2019s tired, even when he\u2019s hoarse, he has a nearly supernatural ability to yell at people. And how does he stay perpetually agitated? He also showed again that he\u2019s a democratic socialist through and through.\n\nWill Wilkinson (7/10) \u2014 His hoarseness demonstrated that one may not continuously yell at high volumes with total impunity. Still, America's favorite democratic socialist turned in a typically solid performance. He's the most take-it-or-leave-it guy up there.\n\nTanzina Vega (8/10) \u2014 In typical style, Sanders tussled with Warren and Biden on healthcare reform. He gets extra points for reminding Biden that he voted against the Iraq war and all three of Trump's military budgets.\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nGail Collins (6/10) \u2014 Some great one-liners and finale, but that\u2019s her only star turn.\n\nRoss Douthat (6/10) \u2014 She was more interesting, intense and combative than in previous debates. But she still needs a Biden collapse to have a rationale.\n\nMaureen Dowd (5/10) \u2014 She has good ideas and makes sense, but it\u2019s just not going to happen. The middle lane is occupied.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (5/10) \u2014 She did fine, but given where she is in this race, fine isn\u2019t enough.\n\nDavid Leonhardt (5/10) \u2014 She was at her best when making the pitch for electability. At her worst when she lapsed into senatorial detail.\n\nMiriam Pawel (4/10) \u2014 She needed a breakthrough, and her most memorable line may have been the one everyone should have avoided: \u201cHouston, we have a problem.\u201d\n\nMelanye Price (3/10) \u2014 She wants to represent the people in the middle of extremes \u2014 a losing argument, as she is one of the few moderates left standing \u2014 but barely. Her Midwestern sensibilities are key to how she positions herself, but like Buttigieg, she is out of step with the rest of the party.\n\nMimi Swartz (6/10) \u2014 She\u2019s perfecting her one liners but not sure it moved the needle.\n\nPete Wehner (6/10) \u2014 She was fine, somewhat better than in the past but not nearly good enough. She appealed to unity, but came across as thoroughly uncharismatic.\n\nWill Wilkinson (6/10) \u2014 She continues to cleverly escape withering media attention through sedately relatable but otherwise invisible performances.\n\nTanzina Vega (5/10) \u2014 She wasn\u2019t able to compete with the energy of many of the bigger names on the stage either on policy or in personality.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\n\nGail Collins (6/10) \u2014 He\u2019s still playing smartest boy in the class.\n\nRoss Douthat (3/10) \u2014 He decided to play the Eric Swalwell role, as the also-ran trying to goad Joe Biden about his age. It did as much for him as it did for Swalwell.\n\nMaureen Dowd (4/10) \u2014 Hyperfocused on Biden, trying to get him on the age issue, he snottily taunted him after an exchange on health care: \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d Castro may find, as Harris did after the first debate, that this kind of attack leaves a sour aftertaste for many Dems.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (4/10) \u2014 There needs to be an open discussion of Biden\u2019s mental prowess, because he often seems old, unsteady and incoherent. But Castro\u2019s taunts \u2014 \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d \u2014 backfired, because they were both harsh and wrong.\n\nDavid Leonhardt (3/10) \u2014 Try to imagine Obama, J.F.K. or F.D.R. making the memory crack in a debate. Castro repeated it, to make sure we all understood. It ruined his good moments.\n\nMiriam Pawel (2/10) \u2014 He had nothing to lose by going after Biden, but in the end, nothing to win, either.\n\nMelanye Price (7/10) \u2014 I know some people will say Castro was disrespectful. I disagree. He was a pugilist whose strategy was to go down fighting everybody. He was memorable because he challenged the old guard and because he told stories about his life and career that countered the false narrative Trump has created about Latinos and their place in America. He seems perfectly poised to be a running mate who will fight for the nominee.\n\nMimi Swartz (8/10) \u2014 He bordered on smart-alecky but once again held his own.\n\nPete Wehner (2/10) \u2014 He came across as intensely unlikeable and self-satisfied. Apparently he felt like someone needed to pick up the baton from Bill de Blasio.\n\nWill Wilkinson (6/10) \u2014 I fear his sniping didn't help him, and he clearly screwed up in accusing Biden of forgetting what he had just said about health care. But it's a debate, and I'm firmly on the side of argumentative aggression against the debate's obnoxious civility cops.\n\nTanzina Vega (6/10) \u2014 He leaned a bit more into his Latino identity this time, using Spanish in his opening line and citing racial violence in El Paso Texas against \"people who look like me.\" And yet on immigration he shied away from talking about his plan to decriminalize border crossings and focused more on DACA.\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nGail Collins (1/10) \u2014 Lost me from his \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d plan to give 10 families $1,000 a month.\n\nRoss Douthat (5/10) \u2014 A fine night generally, but the Yangbucks pilot program played as too much of a gimmick when he needs to be getting more voters to take him seriously.\n\nMaureen Dowd (4/10) \u2014 Quirky was fun in debates one and two but he doesn\u2019t seem relevant now.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (3/10) \u2014 His scheme to give 10 families $1,000 a month is gimmicky and gross \u2014 the last thing we need is another game show president.\n\nDavid Leonhardt (4/10) \u2014 The \u201cI\u2019m giving away $1,000\u201d gimmick made me yearn for the future debates that he won\u2019t qualify for. His stirring answer on campaign-finance reform almost changed my mind.\n\nMiriam Pawel (1/10) \u2014 He started out with a gimmick, and went downhill from there.\n\nMelanye Price (5/10) \u2014 In the last debate, he was memorable for his discussion of the robots and mechanized labor that are taking jobs from human beings. Last night, he dropped the robots and simply offered voters cash. It was unexpected and comical to his opponents, who openly laughed.\n\nMimi Swartz (2/10) \u2014 Andrew, the Democratic debates are not a game show with you supplying the grand prize.\n\nPete Wehner (3/10) \u2014 He\u2019s \u201cpro-good school.\u201d He\u2019s signed a pledge to \u201cend the forever wars.\u201d He also advocated for his gimmicky Freedom Dividend idea. He said some other things, too, but I honestly don\u2019t remember them.\n\nWill Wilkinson (5/10) \u2014 He wants to give every American $1,000 a month and has a good gimmick for building his mailing list. At this point, the mailing list sort of seems like what he's in it for.\n\nTanzina Vega (4/10) \u2014 He criticized American politics focus on the \"almighty dollar\" but then turned around and offered \"freedom dividends\" offer came across as a stunt.
