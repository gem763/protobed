Rather, he limited his few evidentiary responses to robotic acknowledgments about what was and was not in the report, which he testified he had never read.\n\nHe largely kept his cool and limited his obvious contempt with the majority to clenched-jaw glares and snide asides. (\u201cUnlike you, Congressman, I don\u2019t live in town.\u201d) When committee counsel Barry Berke took over the questioning at the end, he did knock Lewandowski off balance, and sharply undercut Lewandowski\u2019s testimony that he didn\u2019t think Trump had instructed him to do anything wrong. The half-hour gave us a glimpse of how the past several months could have been very different had professional counsel been doing the questioning, as in Watergate and Iran-Contra\u2026\n\nWhen Trump rode down the golden escalator in June 2015, he was a joke; as president, he has seemed the ultimate one-off, bizarre and singular. But Lewandowski presents the concrete possibility of Trump\u2019s influence extending past his tenure, into a cadre of proudly \u201cTrumpian\u201d political figures. Pugnacious, contemptuous, indifferent to law or fact, Lewandowski is a perfect model for a sustained Trumpian legacy in U.S. political life.", "description": "", "authors": ["Harry Litman", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Lewandowskis-Behavior-Fits-Right-With-Sycophancy-Trumpism"], "top_image": ""}
