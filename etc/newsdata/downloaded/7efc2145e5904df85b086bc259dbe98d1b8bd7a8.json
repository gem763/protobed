He had served 19 months of a 29-month jail sentence for money laundering.\n\nChan Tong-kai, whose case sparked the city\u2019s extradition bill crisis, made a public apology after his release. He bowed twice and said he was willing to surrender to Taiwanese authorities.\n\n\u201cI am willing, for my impulsive act and things I did wrong, to surrender myself to Taiwan to face sentencing,\u201d he said, adding that he would have to accept the consequences for the \u201cworst mistake\u201d he had ever made.\n\nWhat are the 'five demands'? What do protesters want?\n\nReverend Canon Peter Koon Ho-ming, an Anglican priest who had been visiting Chan weekly in jail and played a major role in convincing the Chan to turn himself in, said it was unlikely the former inmate would leave for Taiwan yesterday.\n\nChan is suspected of murdering his pregnant girlfriend, Poon, in Taiwan last year. Her body was found after Chan\u2019s return to Hong Kong.\n\nBut Chan could not be sent to Taiwan despite requests from Taipei\u2019s authorities, because there is no formal extradition agreement between the two places.\n\nA guide to the key words you see in protest news\n\nThe city is now arguing with Taiwan about Chan\u2019s fate. Taipei authorities first refused to take Chan, then changed their decision and requested the Hong Kong government allow their police to escort him to the island. Hong Kong officials have rejected the offer.\n\nA local spokesman said the Taiwanese authorities\u2019 plan to send law enforcement officers to Hong Kong showed disrespect \u201cfor Hong Kong\u2019s jurisdictional power and is totally unacceptable\u201d.\n\nThe extradition bill was officially withdrawn yesterday afternoon, with Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu fulfilling the formal procedures in the Legislative Council.\n\nEdited by M.
