(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday excoriated an unidentified whistleblower and the White House aides who informed their complaint as \u201calmost a spy\u201d and likened their work to treason \u2014 part of a scorched-earth strategy he is directing for the Republican Party at the outset of an impeachment showdown.\n\nTrump has acted impulsively and indignantly as he wages an all-out political war to defend himself from allegations that he abused his power to solicit foreign interference in his 2020 reelection bid.\n\nAnd in a testament to how completely he controls the Republican Party, many GOP officeholders and conservative media figures have followed Trump\u2019s cues by joining his attempts either to attack the anonymous whistleblower, discredit the explosive accounts in their complaint, or malign the media for covering it.\n\nThe coming weeks will test whether Trump\u2019s familiar blame-the-accuser-and-counterattack playbook \u2014 while floating dark conspiracies to divert attention \u2014 will be successful in the face of mounting evidence that he asked Ukraine to dig up dirt on potential 2020 Democratic opponent Joe Biden.\n\nTrump\u2019s own appointed intelligence chief testified Thursday to the whistleblower\u2019s credibility, and some of the allegations in the complaint were confirmed by the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the White House released Wednesday.\n\nLong indifferent to the norms that restrained his predecessors, Trump shattered another one Thursday by alluding to violence and possible death for the whistleblower\u2019s sources in an apparent warning to witnesses inside the government who might be asked to testify against him.\n\nAddressing employees of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations during a closed-door meeting in New York, Trump said, \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now,\u201d Trump said, according to an audio recording published by the Los Angeles Times. An attendee confirmed the comments to The Washington Post.\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) enters her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump has been setting the tone for his party, driving news coverage as ever with a blizzard of provocative comments and dashing any hopes Republican leaders may have had for a more measured impeachment strategy.\n\n\u201cI took a long walk around the [House] floor tonight, talking to dozens of members, and I haven\u2019t seen this level of intensity of support for the president since the 2016 campaign,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a Trump loyalist, said late Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re with him and ready to go.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers said they envision a \u201csplit screen\u201d strategy in the coming weeks. The president is considering stepping up his fall schedule of campaign rallies at arenas across the country to galvanize his supporters outside of Washington and portray House Democrats as liberal insiders who are focused on impeachment instead of governing.\n\nCurrent and former White House officials summed up the mood inside the president\u2019s inner circle as battle-scarred but determined, taking some solace that the president has survived past battles \u2014 from the special counsel Russia investigation to the federal probe of hush-money payments \u2014 that had been considered political death knells.\n\n\u201cThis has been a presidency defined by fights and battles and fending off attacks and attacking back, so in a sense this is the next phase,\u201d said a former senior White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. \u201cThere\u2019s been a bunker mentality. That has come to be the normal state of affairs.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Trump talks to others as he walks back to the Oval Office after sheriffs presented him with an appreciation plaque at the South Portico of the White House on Thursday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump has informally discussed with aides whether to establish a war room inside or outside his understaffed White House to manage the impeachment inquiry, as President Bill Clinton had in the late 1990s. Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s controversial former campaign manager, has been mentioned as a possible hire, but no decisions have been made.\n\n\u201cI have had no conversation with anyone at the White House regarding this,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cIf the president asks me to push back on the fake impeachment narrative, I will do that in any way I can.\u201d\n\nTrump is single-handedly shaping his party\u2019s emerging impeachment response strategy, reflecting the calculation among Republicans on Capitol Hill that his political base is required to carry the party through the 2020 elections, even if some lawmakers privately disapprove of his conduct.\n\n\u201cHe remains the leader of the party, period, and the party is even more with him than ever,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n\nDuring his questioning of acting director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire at Thursday\u2019s House Intelligence Committee hearing, ranking Republican Devin Nunes (Calif.) badgered Democrats over what he termed an \u201cinformation warfare operation against the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, the Democrats, their media mouthpieces and a cabal of leakers are ginning up a fake story with no regard to the monumental damage they\u2019re causing to our public institutions and to trust in government \u2014 and without acknowledging all the false stories they propagated in the past,\u201d Nunes said.\n\n\n\nRepublican Reps. Michael R. Turner (Ohio), from left, K. Michael Conaway (Texas) and Devin Nunes (Calif.), right, wait for the arrival of acting director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire at a House Intelligence Committee hearing Thursday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nYet the hearing exposed some cracks in Trump\u2019s support. Rep. Michael R. Turner, a rank-and-file Republican from Ohio, said, \u201cI want to say to the president: This is not okay. That conversation is not okay. And I think it\u2019s disappointing to the American public when they read the transcript.\u201d\n\nStill, most GOP lawmakers unwilling to parrot the president\u2019s lines Thursday simply strove to stay silent. In the halls of the Capitol, \u201chaven\u2019t read the report\u201d was a common refrain. That was the answer to reporters\u2019 questions about the whistleblower complaint from at least five Republican senators: Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Rob Portman (Ohio), Tim Scott (S.C.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.).\n\n\u201cIf you do want to talk about ethanol, I am happy to talk about ethanol,\u201d Ernst offered.\n\nWhen Sen. Ted Cruz was asked whether he was ready to be on the \u201cfront lines\u201d to defend Trump, the Texas Republican deflected the question and said flatly that he was working for \u201cthe people of Texas.\u201d\n\nAfter making critical comments of Trump\u2019s conduct with Zelensky earlier in the week, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters Thursday, \u201cNothing to add.\u201d\n\n\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) speaks to journalists before votes on Monday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter a splashy warning Wednesday about Republicans \u201crushing to circle the wagons\u201d around Trump, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) rendered himself mute Thursday. He navigated the Senate halls with a phone pressed to his ear, always talking and making himself unable to field any questions.\n\nIf the Democrat-controlled House votes to impeach Trump, Senate Republicans will have to decide whether to form a bulwark protecting Trump or to convict him, which would require a two-thirds majority vote in the upper chamber.\n\n\u201cRepublicans will be judged by history on whether they were judicial and operating on behalf of the United States or just rubber-stamping Trump\u2019s behavior,\u201d historian Douglas Brinkley said. \u201cIt puts Republicans in the Senate in a moral conundrum.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s intraparty foes are actively working to take advantage of this juncture. GOP strategist Stuart Stevens, who supports former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld\u2019s long-shot primary challenge to Trump, said he and other Trump critics want to \u201celevate this issue\u201d among Republicans, despite appearing futile at times.\n\n\u201cDo you want to drop down into the sewer to defend Donald Trump?\u201d Stevens said of fellow Republicans. \u201cNobody gets out of that sewer smelling the same as when they dropped into it. He\u2019d do nothing for these people, cares nothing for them. It\u2019s all transactional. Why are they putting their political lives on the line for someone they wouldn\u2019t have had dinner with three or four years ago?\u201d\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) appear at a news conference at the Capitol on Tuesday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nWhite House advisers said they have high confidence that Senate Republicans will have the president\u2019s back. They cited the political bond Trump has built with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as they have installed scores of conservatives in the federal judiciary.\n\nWhen asked about Romney\u2019s latest expression of alarm, one White House official mocked him as the \u201cjunior senator from Utah.\u201d But the group of lawmakers West Wing aides see as most susceptible to turning on Trump are retiring Republicans in the House and Senate, because they may not fear the president\u2019s wrath as much as their colleagues standing for reelection.\n\nA key element of Trump\u2019s strategy has been to try to shine an uncomfortable light on Biden by making unsubstantiated claims of corruption about the former vice president and his son Hunter. Nearly every set of public remarks Trump has made this week has been heavy on Biden references and insinuations.\n\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, said it was smart for Republicans to \u201cfocus on Biden and make the Democrats look ridiculous.\u201d\n\nA legislative pursuit is also in the works: Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, told reporters this week that he has \u201csome real legitimate questions\u201d about the Bidens\u2019 connections to Ukraine and is exploring a formal investigation.\n\n\u201cListen, I want to get to the truth,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in show trials.\u201d\n\nPaul Kane contributed to this report.", "description": "The coming weeks will test whether Trump\u2019s familiar blame-the-accuser-and-counterattack playbook will be successful in the face of mounting evidence that he asked Ukraine to dig up dirt on potential 2020 Democratic opponent Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress", "Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HivFvfJS-mqjEsR3QF2LMu3QkE4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LMJCTDXAQ4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
