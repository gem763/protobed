He was later reprimanded by the school\u2019s principal, who told him \u201cYou know what you do to diffuse a situation like that? You say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I meant to say him\u2019\u201d.\n\nHowever the incident appeared to have been the final straw after several concerns were raised with school officials relating to his treatment of the student in December. The following day Mr Vlaming was suspended, before being removed from his post after a five-and-a-half-hour hearing.\n\nNow his legal representation claims the government has forced Mr Vlaming \u201cto express ideas about human nature, unrelated to the school\u2019s curriculum, that he believes are false\u201d, and to \u201ctake sides in an ongoing public debate about gender dysphoria\u201d.\n\nThe teacher is being represented by lawyers from the Alliance Defending Freedom \u2013 a legal advocacy operation identified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Centre. The ADF refute the claim.\n\nThe complaint adds: \u201cDefendants gave Mr Vlaming an ultimatum: use male pronouns for this female student or lose your job.\n\n\u201cMr Vlaming could not violate his conscience, and it cost him his job\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for West Point Schools told The Washington Post it would \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the claim.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Trans man loses court fight to be called father instead of mother", "description": "A Virginia high school teacher has filed a lawsuit after being fired for refusing to use a transgender student\u2019s pronouns, arguing he is being discriminated against for his faith.Peter Vlaming, who worked as a French teacher at West Point High School, Virginia, said he would use the student\u2019s chosen", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1pcrM6GXmlzfhluH6IpJew--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/3396d36d79ef0740495c4c3750cfab66"}
