It also fuels doubts about nuclear\u2019s future in France, where the government has been reluctant to approve new projects before Flamanville-3 is online.\n\nEDF (PA: ) has increased its estimated bill for the project by 1.5 billion euros in the latest assessment, it said Wednesday in a statement. The almost-completed plant, which is already seven years behind schedule, won\u2019t be able to load nuclear fuel before the end of 2022 as EDF needs to repair 66 welds, it said.\n\n\u201cThe market was already anticipating some additional cost for the weld issue,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note. \u201cHowever, these costs, in our opinion, are slightly higher than what would have been anticipated.\u201d\n\nEDF (PA: ) shares fell as much as 1.6% in Paris, and were down 0.8% at 9.47 euros as of 10:23 a.m. local time.\n\nEDF\u2019s preferred scenario for repairs, which includes using remote-operated robots to conduct high-precision operations inside piping for eight welds, would push net investment to 15.5 billion euros in 2020, a 500 million-euro increase. It would trim net income by a projected 400 million euros next year, EDF (PA: ) said.\n\nThe utility aims to secure approval from the French nuclear-safety authority for its repair plan by the end of next year. It also has a fallback option, which would entail extracting the piping to repair the welds, but that would \u201cprobably lead to a extra delay of one year and an extra cost of 400 million euros,\u201d EDF\u2019s head of nuclear new-build, Xavier Ursat, said on a conference call.\n\nThe budget for Flamanville-3 has more than tripled since construction started in 2007. The repeated setbacks, which have forced EDF (PA: ) to sell assets to curb debt in recent years, contrast with tumbling costs for solar and wind projects. While nuclear energy can provide low-carbon electricity around the clock, spiraling costs may make it harder for EDF to convince the French and British governments to provide the support needed to help it fund new atomic plants.\n\nThe French government has asked EDF (PA: ) to prove by the middle of 2021 that it can build competitively priced nuclear plants to replace some of its 58 aging reactors. Competition from other clean-energy sources is stiff. France, like Britain, is working to step up the pace of building offshore wind farms.\n\nThe new setback at Flamanville also comes at a critical juncture, with EDF (PA: ) seeking to sell as many as six similar reactors in India. It\u2019s competing with Russian, Chinese and U.S. builders in other markets such as Saudi Arabia.\n\nEDF (PA: ) has repeatedly blamed the delays at Flamanville on a lull in reactor construction in France at the turn of this century, saying that led to a loss of knowhow. Two similar reactors built by a venture between EDF and China General Nuclear Power Corp. in southwest China successfully started up in recent months.\n\nThe delay in starting the 1.6-gigawatt Flamanville project is likely to put some strain on France\u2019s power supply in the event of unexpectedly cold winters. The government is forcing EDF (PA: ) to close two 900-megawatt reactors along the German border next year, and it also wants utilities to shutter 3 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity in 2022.\n\n(Updates with analyst comment in fourth paragraph, shares in fifth)", "description": "EDF Cost Overrun at French Plant Piles Pressure on Nuclear Giant", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
