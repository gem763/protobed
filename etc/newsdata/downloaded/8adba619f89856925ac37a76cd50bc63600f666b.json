And rural states in the Midwest and south seem to have given Republicans an enduring edge in the Senate.\n\nBut why?\n\nYahoo Finance recently asked Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat who\u2019s in his second term in an otherwise red state, why Democrats bomb with rural voters. \u201cWe don\u2019t even show up in those areas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don't necessarily have to say, okay, I'm going to win all of rural America. But you have to be able to get the votes out of it that we need, ultimately, to win. And you can't just do that by ignoring these areas.\u201d\n\nBullock is running for president, and on paper he ought to be a strong contender. Trump won Montana by 20 percentage points in 2016, yet in the same year Bullock beat his Republican opponent by 4 points. That means he has already won some Trump voters, which is what Democrats need to take back the White House next year. Yet Bullock lacks the name recognition of a front-runner and his centrist policies alienate left-leaning Democrats who back Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. He didn\u2019t qualify for the latest Democratic debate.\n\nBullock\u2019s strength among rural voters in his home state isn\u2019t an anomaly. Up until 2009, rural voters were about evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Today, however, Republicans have a 16-point advantage in rural areas, according to Pew Research. Many rural voters, who tend to be white Christians, see the Democratic party as urban elitists obsessed with multicultural causes foreign to them. Barack Obama didn\u2019t help when, at a 2008 fundraiser in San Francisco, he patronized small-town Americans as \u201cbitter\u201d people who \u201ccling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren\u2019t like them.\u201d\n\nThe urban-rural gap\n\nOne difference between urban and rural voters is that many big cities have growing populations fueling growing economies, while the majority of rural areas are losing population. But rural residents aren\u2019t ready to write off their communities. \u201cJust like in urban areas,\u201d Bullock says, \u201cfolks are saying, I want to be able to stay in my community, have a decent living.\u201d\n\nThe urban-rural gap comes through in some of the Democrats\u2019 policy priorities. Sanders and Warren, for instance, favor free college for most or all students, along with forgiveness of student debt. Many rural voters are unimpressed. \u201cWhen over two-thirds of Americans don't even have a two-year degree,\u201d Bullock says, \u201cif all we're talking about is free college, then they're saying, what are you doing for my lives?\u201d\n\nThere ought to be opportunities for Democratic gains in at least some rural areas. Trump\u2019s trade war has hurt farmers who are losing access to China and other foreign markets. Twenty percent of rural hospitals are at risk of closing, a problem that will get worse if the Trump administration succeeds in a lawsuit meant to kill the Affordable Care Act. Rural voters may be even more exposed than urbanites to rising health care costs, since there are fewer big companies offering coverage in those areas.\n\nDespite his gaffe in San Francisco, Obama showed up in Montana and other rural states while campaigning in 2008. He lost Montana by 2 points, but did win Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. In 2016, Hillary Clinton focused less on rural areas, and paid the price. She didn\u2019t even visit Wisconsin, assuming it would fall her way. It didn\u2019t. The next Democratic nominee should probably get out a little bit more.\n\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
