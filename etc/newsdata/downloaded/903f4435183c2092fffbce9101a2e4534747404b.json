Wade decision, to not have a functioning abortion clinic, if the last standing clinic in the state is shut down.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region had its license officially expire at the end of May. A court ordered the clinic to continue providing abortions until the dispute with the state health department is resolved.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has been fighting the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services for months to keep the clinic open after state health officials announced it would not renew the license, citing alleged violations of state laws.\n\nThe state alleges that during an inspection in March, investigators cited three \u201cfailed abortions\u201d that required additional surgeries and life-threatening complications for the mother, according to the AP.\n\nThe Administrative Hearing Commission was set to take up the case in August, but it was pushed back to begin this week. The hearing is expected to last five days, the AP reported. A ruling isn\u2019t expected until February at the earliest, according to AP.\n\nThe health department said the renewal of the abortion license is contingent on interviews with doctors who have worked at the clinic. Planned Parenthood said the doctors were not considered official staff of the organization and could not be compelled to interview.\n\nBut the department would not budge and said it needed to complete the interviews as part of the ongoing investigation into the alleged violations.\n\nThe dispute over the lone clinic comes as Missouri joined several states this year to pass restrictive abortion bans. Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed a bill in May banning abortion after eight weeks with no exceptions for rape and incest.\n\nA federal judge temporarily blocked the abortion ban in August. Similar bills in Kentucky and Mississippi have also been blocked by courts this year.\n\nA Planned Parenthood clinic opened earlier this month just over state lines in Fairview Heights, Ill., that can provide abortion services to around 11,000 women per year.", "description": "A hearing over Missouri\u2019s last standing abortion clinic\u00a0will begin on Monday to determine whether it can keep its license to provide abortions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/planned-parenthood.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
