The parade continues on Thursday with Accenture Plc ( ACN ) , a company he was bullish on.\n\nLet's check out the charts and indicators of this consulting and technology company.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of ACN, below, we can see a big rally from late December around $135 to above $200 earlier this month. Prices have been testing the rising 50-day moving average line a lot the past seven weeks and the daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has rolled over the past seven weeks suggesting a shift from aggressive buying to aggressive selling.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been weakening since the middle of July and is now close to crossing below the zero line.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of ACN, below, we see some mixed signals. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line and based on just the past three years ACN looks extended above this indicator.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been stalled the past three months even as prices have made new highs. This is a bearish divergence and could be significant. The MACD oscillator has crossed to the downside for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of ACN, below, we can see a potential upside price projection of $276 but we can also see that a trade at $186 is likely to weaken this chart.\n\nBottom-line strategy: We can find bullish and bearish signals on ACN ahead of earnings this week. I would not favor either direction but a breakdown under support at $185 would be bearish.", "description": "With Mixed Signals on Accenture Ahead of Earnings, Tread Carefully...ACN", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "With Mixed Signals On Accenture Ahead Of Earnings", "Tread Carefully", "We Can Find Both Bullish", "Bearish Signals On Acn Ahead Of Earnings This Week.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Peter Tchir", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/accenture.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
