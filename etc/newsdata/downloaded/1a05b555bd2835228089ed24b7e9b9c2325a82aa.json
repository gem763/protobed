This shop window will encourage young Canadian players to keep playing and be the next Tyler (Ardron).\n\nBut the pathway to professional rugby is \u201cbroken\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe domestic game in Canada, until recently, was amateur. We do have the Toronto Arrows now taking part in the MLR (Major League Rugby), which is a pathway for players to get an opportunity to be in a daily training environment.\n\n\u201cBut it is becoming more difficult for our players to get a chance (in Europe).\u201d\n\nCanada will have a last opportunity to pick up a win on Sunday in Kamaishi against fellow Pool B minnows Namibia, coached by fellow Welshman Phil Davies.\n\nDespite the heavy scorelines against Canada, which has seen them concede 177 points in three matches, the most of any side in the competition, Jones believes he will be able to call the tournament a success if they can leave Japan with a victory.\n\n\u201cIt would be considered, from my point of view, very successful if we do get a win. But it is about performance, we will have to play very well,\u201d he said.", "description": "Victory over Namibia would mark a successful World Cup for Canada, although giving rugby a \"shop window\" outweighs the results, coach Kingsley Jones said on Tuesday after losing 66-7 to South Africa in Kobe.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438490590&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9716S-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
