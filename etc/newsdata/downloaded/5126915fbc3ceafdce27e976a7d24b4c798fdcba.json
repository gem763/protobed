No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nImpeachment is a rare and dramatic escalation that will reshape Trump\u2019s already norm-shattering presidency as he seeks re-election. It is also freighted with political risks in a nation deeply divided over this president.\n\nTrump delivered a bellicose response on Twitter, accusing Democrats of \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d.\n\n\u201cSuch an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage,\u201d Trump tweeted from New York as he attended the UN general assembly there. \u201cSo bad for our Country!\u201d\n\nAfter months of resistance in the face of calls from many fellow Democrats in Washington, Pelosi appeared to have determined that Trump\u2019s alleged conduct and his administration\u2019s refusal to comply with congressional requests for information and testimony had forced the House\u2019s hand, leaving members no choice but to move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nImpeachment: how does it work and what happens next? Read more\n\nDuring a meeting with the Democratic caucus on Tuesday, Pelosi said that they must \u201cstrike while the iron is hot\u201d as she laid out her case for an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThis is a national security issue,\u201d she said, according to a senior aide in the room. \u201cAnd we cannot let him think that this is a casual thing.\u201d\n\nShe vowed to move ahead \u201cexpeditiously\u201d.\n\nIn her official announcement, Pelosi noted that the chairs of six key House committees already involved in investigating Trump and his administration would make recommendations to the House judiciary committee, which has the authority to handle impeachment. Their reports could help form articles of impeachment brought against the president.\n\nLaunching an impeachment inquiry does not necessarily mean that the House will vote to charge the president with \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d, though that is the likely outcome of such a process. If the House does charge the president, the articles of impeachment would then be sent to the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans who rarely break with Trump.\n\nPelosi\u2019s announcement follows allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a July phone call to investigate the son of Joe Biden, the former vice-president and the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to compete for the White House in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump on the sidelines of the UN general assembly on Tuesday. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nTrump has admitted that he discussed Biden on a call with Zelenskiy but has denied any suggestion of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d, even as it was reported that he ordered his staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid to Ukraine days before his call with Zelenskiy.\n\nThe allegations came to light after a whistleblower working in US intelligence filed a formal complaint reportedly related to the phone call. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to release the details of the complaint.\n\nMaguire is due to testify on Thursday, his deadline for turning over the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\n\u201cIn light of recent reporting on the whistleblower complaint, I want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,\u201d Maguire said in a statement on Tuesday evening. \u201cI look forward to working with the Administration and Congress to find a resolution regarding this important matter.\u201d\n\nTrump on Tuesday ordered the unredacted transcript of his summer call with Zelenskiy to be released on Wednesday, the same day the pair are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNo pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!\u201d There\u2019s no evidence to support Trump\u2019s repeated claim that Biden improperly used his position as vice president to fire a Ukrainian prosecutor to help his son.\n\nThere is really no other remedy other than impeachment Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal\n\nLater, Trump added: \u201cThey [the Ukrainian government] don\u2019t know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking earlier on Tuesday, Pelosi said Trump did not have to explicitly threaten aid to be guilty of an impeachable offense. \u201cThere is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,\u201d she said, adding that the \u201csequence\u201d of events suggested that the president acted improperly.\n\n\n\nLater that afternoon, the Senate, in a rare act of bipartisanship, unanimously approved a resolution calling for the DNI to turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\nPelosi\u2019s change of heart came as Democrats from across the party amplified their calls from impeachment after revelations of the whistleblower complaint, which the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog, Gen Michael Atkinson, deemed credible and an \u201curgent concern\u201d. The White House has refused to share the complaint with Congress as typically required by law, arguing that the allegations do not fall within the intelligence community whistleblower statute.\n\nFor months, Pelosi had stubbornly resisted calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment, telling colleagues at various points that the president was \u201cnot worth\u201d impeaching and that she would rather see him \u201cin prison\u201d than impeached.\n\nThe House judiciary committee had been conducting an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d that centered on the revelations contained in the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, as well as several other allegations against Trump, his administration and his financial ties. But now the inquiry has the full support of the speaker, as well as several once reluctant members of Congress.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The rising sun illuminates the US Capitol Building in Washington.

Only two presidents have ever been impeached \u2013 Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither were convicted by the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned before a vote on impeachment in the full House could be taken.\n\nIn the 24 hours preceding Pelosi\u2019s formal address, dozens of Democrats, including those in districts that voted for Trump, endorsed a plan to move forward with impeachment. Pelosi informed a Democratic caucus meeting on Capitol Hill on Tuesday afternoon of her plans.\n\n\u201cThere is really no other remedy other than impeachment,\u201d said the congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, a Washington progressive and an early backer of impeaching the president.\n\nBut not all Democrats support impeachment. Congressman Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said an impeachment inquiry would distract from Democrats\u2019 legislative priorities and deepen the political divides in the country.\n\n\u201cI want to do what\u2019s right. I don\u2019t want to tear the country apart,\u201d he told reporters after the closed-door meeting. \u201cThe majority of Americans, at this point in time, do not want to see this.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Investigation will cast a dark cloud over Trump\u2019s already norm-shattering presidency as he faces re-election", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b12354d156471e2e5288dbd7275de02d25c0a5f/0_289_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=01e2d83109a17db6effe3cca0a6f13bc", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
