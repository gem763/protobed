(AP) - Matthew McKay has handled himself well since replacing Ryan Finley as North Carolina State\u2019s quarterback. Now the sophomore gets will find out what it\u2019s like to start on the road.\n\nThe Wolfpack (2-0) have outscored opponents by a combined 75-6 and travel Saturday to face West Virginia, which might have been a formidable opponent a year ago had the teams\u2019 matchup not been canceled by Hurricane Florence in Raleigh, North Carolina. This year, the Mountaineers (1-1) are struggling especially on offense.\n\nMcKay isn\u2019t. He\u2019s completing 66 percent of his passes and has yet to throw an interception.\n\nNC State coach Dave Doeren wants to see how McKay handles playing before a hostile crowd.\n\n\u201cYou just smile when you start hearing that, people yelling at you,\u201d Doeren said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it fun to me. There\u2019s nothing more rewarding in my opinion than going into someone else\u2019s stadium and all that against you and playing really good football. That\u2019s a tribute to your focus and your preparation if you can pull that off.\u201d\n\nThe Wolfpack\u2019s young backfield also includes freshmen Zonovan Knight (161 yards) and Jordan Houston (108), who have combined to adequately replace departed top rusher Reggie Gallaspy.\n\nWest Virginia went the transfer route after losing its star passer and most of its receiving production, adding Austin Kendall (Oklahoma) at quarterback and Sean Ryan (Temple) and George Campbell (Florida State) at receiver.\n\nBut the Mountaineers have serious blocking issues on the offense line. They are dead last in the Bowl Subdivision with an average of 1.1 yard per rush.\n\n\u201cI think this is our first real test, the first real adversity this football team has had and how do we handle it?\u201d coach Neal Brown said. \u201cHow do we respond? I think this week will be a good indication of where we\u2019re at as far as being able to respond to things that don\u2019t necessarily go our way.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know about the Wolfpack\u2019s first visit to Morgantown since 1979:\n\nOLD FRIENDS RETURN\n\nNorth Carolina State defensive co-coordinator Tony Gibson spent 13 seasons on the Mountaineers\u2019 staff, including the past five as defensive coordinator.\n\nAmong the inductees into West Virginia\u2019s Sports Hall of Fame before Saturday\u2019s game is Steve Dunlap. He was defensive coordinator and worked other positions for the Mountaineers from 1984-2000 and again from 2008-14. He was NC State\u2019s defensive coordinator in 2006-07. The former linebacker still holds WVU school records with 190 tackles as a junior in 1974, including 28 against Boston College.\n\nTOUGH AT HOME\n\nWest Virginia is 20-1 in nonconference home games since 2010. Some of its marquee matchups over the past decade have been played at neutral sites.\n\nDIFFERING DEFENSES\n\nN.C. State held East Carolina to 41 rushing yards and FCS Western Carolina to 106 total yards. The Wolfpack and Wisconsin are the only teams in the country that have not allowed a touchdown this season.\n\nWest Virginia held FCS James Madison out of the end zone in the second half of a 20-13 win two weeks ago but got shredded by Missouri, which compiled 232 rushing yards. West Virginia coaches counted 22 missed tackles.\n\n\u201cWe are way more capable than what we showed,\u201d defensive coordinator Vic Koenning said. \u201cWe have to have more courage to make plays.\u201d\n\nSTEADY KICKER\n\nNC State\u2019s Christopher Dunn has made 19 consecutive field goal attempts, the longest streak in the nation.\n\nCOACH vs. COACH\n\nWhen Brown was the head coach at Troy, the Trojans lost 49-21 to Doeren\u2019s Wolfpack in the 2015 opener in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Matthew McKay has handled himself well since replacing Ryan Finley as North Carolina State's quarterback.
