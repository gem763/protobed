But even Susanna Reid may have reached her limit this morning when Piers asked viewers if they\u2019d had sex in Pizza Express.\n\nThis was, of course, all in the effort to aid the struggling food firm, which many fear is about to fold amid urgent talks with creditors.\n\nThe former Britain\u2019s Got Talent judge seemed to take the news badly, openly lamenting the business\u2019 fate and pleading with viewers to help him save the Italian food chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPiers is not happy about Pizza Express possibly folding (Picture: ITV/REX)\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t let Pizza Express go under,\u2019 he pleaded. \u2018Please, tell me your stories. Did you fall in love in Pizza Express? Did you get divorced in Pizza Express? Did you have a fight in Pizza Express?\u2019\n\nThings took a turn for the worst when Piers made another bizarre request, asking audience members to relay intimate acts they may have performed in the restaurant.\n\n\u2018Did you have sex in Pizza Express?\u2019 Piers asked, giggling as co-host Susanna looked on even more mortified than usual. The former newspaper editor couldn\u2019t resist taking the joke even further, though.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s not bring Boris into it,\u2019 he added with a smirk.\n\nSusanna Reid was shocked to say the least at Piers\u2019 latest outburst (Picture: ITV/REX)\n\n\u2018Piers\u2026\u2019 Susanna groaned after the X-rated question. \u2018[It\u2019s] always up to the line\u2026and Piers is over it!\u2019\n\nThis comes less than 24 hours after Piers and Susanna interviewed Jennifer Arcuri on the show yesterday. During the grilling, the model and businesswoman refused to confirm claims that she had slept with the Prime Minister.\n\nSpeaking of takeaways, however, the GMB also welcomed this morning a man who lost 20 stone after being \u2018fat-shamed\u2019.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6.30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
