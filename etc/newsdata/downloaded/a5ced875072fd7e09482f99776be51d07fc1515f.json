Advice was given that the dogs needed cooked pasta into their dog food. It was advised that the dogs should be taken to the vets.\u2019\n\nOne of the dogs, referred to in court as HM1, was so badly starved his hips were visible (Picture: BPM)\n\nSome of the dogs were covered in deep scratches and that had not been treated by a vet (Picture: BPM)\n\nBut by March this year the couple had failed to take the dogs to the vets with Wood saying it was because they were \u2018very busy\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspectors from the RSPCA visited in March but could not get access until May 24 when police attended with Helen Mead from the charity.\n\nButt warned that Bear, six, was aggressive, but Ms Mead could see he was lethargic with his hip bones visible.\n\nRio was also grumbling and had scabs.\n\nMr Purchase said: \u2018The fear was that it had a fight with one of the other dogs. The scratches were deep and the dog had not had any treatment.\n\n\u2018Mr Wood said the dogs were fed a lot of food. Ms Mead asked there was any dog food but Mr Wood said no.\n\nLaura Butt, 33, and Timothy Wood, 53, were banned from keeping animals for three years (Picture: BPM)\n\n\u2018The concern was that the dogs were not being fed on dog food but scrap food from the local takeaway. It would appear the dogs were so thin because of their diet. All four dogs were seized.\u2019\n\nMr Purchase added : \u2018Advice was ignored between December and May. Ms Mead tried to work with the defendants without the need for legal action.\u2019\n\nThe court heard that Miss Butt had \u2018found herself in a situation nobody would ever want to find themselves in\u2019.\n\nHe added that Molly has since put on weight as well as Bear. All dogs are still with the RSPCA.\n\nThey were ordered to pay \u00a31,240 and banned from keeping dogs for three years.", "description": "A couple have been told they cannot have animals after leaving their dogs to starve for months and failing to take them to the vets.
