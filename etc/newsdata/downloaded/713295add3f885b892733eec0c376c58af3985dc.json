(AP) - Melvin Gordon called Los Angeles Chargers coach Anthony Lynn on Wednesday night to let him know he was ending his holdout.\n\nLynn wasn\u2019t ready to believe it until the fifth-year running back walked through the door at the team\u2019s complex. That happened Thursday morning as Gordon took part in his first practice since the final day of minicamp on June 13.\n\nGordon missed training camp and LA\u2019s first three games as he held out for 65 days in the vain hopes of getting a new contract.\n\nLynn said he wasn\u2019t concerned about Gordon\u2019s frame of mind after their long conversation.\n\n\u201cThat was the biggest concern, but I\u2019m telling you that he\u2019s in a good place right now. He just wanted to play football,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nGordon did not appear during Thursday\u2019s media availability. He is expected to take questions after Friday\u2019s practice.\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) - Nigel Bradham picked off Aaron Rodgers\u2019 pass in the end zone with 20 seconds left, Jordan Howard gashed Green Bay for his second career three-touchdown game and the Philadelphia Eagles ended a two-game losing streak with 34-27 victory over the Packers on Thursday night.\n\nHoward finished with 15 carries for 87 yards with two touchdowns rushing and one receiving, Carson Wentz went 16 for 27 for 160 yards, three scores and no turnovers, and the Eagles (2-2) rebounded after losing back-to-back games by a combined seven points.\n\nRodgers started 10 for 10 and finished 34 for 53 for 422 yards, two touchdowns and a fumble that set up a short Philadelphia scoring drive.\n\nDavante Adams had a career-high 180 yards on 10 catches for Green Bay, but he wasn\u2019t on the field for the Packers (3-1) on the last drive because of a toe injury.\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) - Hall of Fame broadcaster Marty Brennaman called his final Cincinnati Reds game Thursday.\n\nBrennaman\u2019s move ended a 46-year career that\u2019s featured so many big stars and historic moments - Hank Aaron, the Big Red Machine, Pete Rose - and more than a few verbal tiffs with fans and players who weren\u2019t exactly endeared to his tell-it-like-it-is style.\n\nThe Reds\u2019 voice since 1974, the 77-year-old Brennaman intended to quietly retire after the season. He agreed to a farewell season that would allow fans and teams to show their appreciation and celebrate a career with so many calls: Aaron\u2019s 714th homer that tied Babe Ruth, three World Series titles and Rose\u2019s record-setting hit No. 4,192 among the most memorable.\n\nFor one more time, Brennaman was nearly as big as the game itself.\n\nNFL\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) - Nigel Bradham picked off Aaron Rodgers\u2019 pass in the end zone with 20 seconds left, Jordan Howard gashed Green Bay for his second career three-touchdown game and the Philadelphia Eagles ended a two-game losing streak with 34-27 victory over the Packers on Thursday night.\n\nHoward finished with 15 carries for 87 yards with two touchdowns rushing and one receiving, Carson Wentz went 16 for 27 for 160 yards, three scores and no turnovers, and the Eagles (2-2) rebounded after losing back-to-back games by a combined seven points.\n\nRodgers started 10 for 10 and finished 34 for 53 for 422 yards, two touchdowns and a fumble that set up a short Philadelphia scoring drive.\n\nDavante Adams had a career-high 180 yards on 10 catches for Green Bay, but he wasn\u2019t on the field for the Packers (3-1) on the last drive because of a toe injury.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Jennifer Lopez and Shakira are going to bring the heat to the 2020 Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show.\n\nNFL, Pepsi and Roc Nation announced Thursday that the superstar performers, who have released music in Spanish and English since the 1990s, will perform on Feb. 2 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nLopez and Shakira both posted a photo of them standing side by side on social media to announce the news. \u201cGoing to see the world on fire,\u201d Lopez wrote.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any bigger than this! So excited about getting on that #SuperBowlLIV #PepsiHalftime stage!\u201d Shakira wrote.\n\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL\n\nATLANTA (AP) - Georgia Tech\u2019s basketball team was banned from postseason play for the upcoming season and slapped Thursday with four years of probation for major recruiting violations committed by a former assistant coach and an ex-friend of head coach Josh Pastner.\n\nThe sanctions handed down by the NCAA also included a reduction in scholarships, limits on recruiting and a fine of $5,000 plus 2% of the program\u2019s budget - a major blow to Pastner\u2019s efforts to rebuild the struggling Atlantic Coast Conference program.\n\nThe NCAA said former assistant coach Darryl LaBarrie gave $300 to a highly touted prospect for a visit to an Atlanta strip club and arranged for him to meet with a former Georgia Tech athlete who played for the NBA\u2019s Atlanta Hawks, including a visit to the player\u2019s home and a free meal at a lounge owned by the player.\n\nThe NBA player was not identified, but Jarrett Jack was on the Hawks\u2019 roster in 2016. He never played for Atlanta, which waived him during training camp as he struggled to return from a serious knee injury\n\nSWIMMING AND DIVING\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Terry Bassett has been hired as CEO of USA Diving, taking on the role nearly a year after his predecessor left having served 16 months on the job.\n\nUSA Diving said Thursday that Bassett will begin his duties Oct. 1.\n\nHe succeeds Lee Walsi Johnson, who came over from USA Gymnastics where he was vice president of marketing. Jack Perkins had been acting CEO.\n\nBassett most recently worked at Nitro Circus, Travis Pastrana\u2019s action sports company where Bassett was vice president of partnership marketing and sales.\n\nBassett has had other stints with the Miami Dolphins, NASCAR/International Speedway Corp., and the Professional Bull Riders.\n\nSPORTS BROADCASTING\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Fox\u2019s cable sports networks and some local Fox stations have gone dark for customers of satellite TV provider Dish because of a dispute over the networks\u2019 cost.\n\nDish says the broadcast network was pulled in 17 markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. Fox News remains on Dish.\n\nCustomers of the Sling streaming service are also affected.\n\nThese types of blackouts have become increasingly common as broadcasters seek to charge cable and satellite TV providers more. Those costs eventually show up on customers\u2019 bills.\n\nDish is offering affected customers antennas for the Fox network. It\u2019s also recommending the Locast streaming service. Those won\u2019t work for cable. It suggests watching NFL games using the TV antenna or the NFL app for mobile.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "NFL", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
