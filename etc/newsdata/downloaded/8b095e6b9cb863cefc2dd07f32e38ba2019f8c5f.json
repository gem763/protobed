It said it also has tax records \u201crelated to parties not named in the subpoenas but who may constitute \u2018immediate family\u2019\u201d of individuals named in the document request.\n\nMessages were left with a Deutsche Bank attorney seeking comment on the filing.\n\nDeutsche Bank has lent Trump\u2019s real estate company millions of dollars over the years. Lawmakers have said they are seeking the banking records as they investigate possible \u201cforeign influence in the U.S. political process.\u201d\n\nTrump and three of his children sued to stop the House Financial Services and Intelligence committees from getting the records on the grounds that the requests were overly broad and unconstitutional.\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals indicated last week it would take a hard look at the legality of the subpoenas.\n\nThe court is considering an appeal from a lower court\u2019s decision this year to allow the subpoenas to proceed. U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos said in that case that Trump and his companies are \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to succeed in challenging them.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "President Trump's longtime bank revealed Tuesday that it has tax records Congress is seeking in its investigation of the president's finances.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/27/Trump_Bank_Subpoenas_62461.jpg-cf06e_c0-413-5400-3561_s1770x1032.jpg?42742e66d978ea0dbbfdd17c4a036e6523330d36"}
