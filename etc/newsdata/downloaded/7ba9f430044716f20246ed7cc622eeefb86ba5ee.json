Johnson wants to leave the EU by the end of October, whether there's a deal or not.\n\nEarlier, Parliament approved a bill by a vote of 327 to 299 to prevent Johnson from pulling out of the EU without a deal. After the result was announced, Johnson slammed the legislation, saying it could extend the already delayed Brexit process for \"many more years to come.\"\n\nThe Benn Bill, named after Member of Parliament Hilary Benn, of the opposition Labour Party, would compel Johnson to seek an extension until next year if Parliament doesn't OK a no-deal exit.\n\nThis is the second consecutive day Johnson has suffered a political setback. A defection on Tuesday robbed the prime minister of his single-seat majority. On the same day, 21 Tory members joined with the opposition to hand Johnson a stinging parliamentary rebuke by taking control of the chamber's agenda.\n\nYouTube\n\nExplaining his bill, Benn said it \"gives the Government time either to reach a new agreement with the European Union at the European Council meeting next month or to seek Parliament's specific consent to leave the EU without a deal.\"\n\nIf neither of those conditions is met by Oct. 19, Benn says, Johnson must ask the European Council to add another Brexit extension, setting the new date for Jan. 31, 2020.\n\nThe current Brexit deadline of Oct. 31 is itself an extension of the original March 29 date.\n\nJohnson also criticized the bill by saying it seeks to \"force the prime minister, with a pre-drafted letter, to surrender in international negotiations\" with the EU.\n\n\"I refuse to do this,\" Johnson said of that requirement. He then said there is only one way forward: to hold a general election on Oct. 15.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party, criticized Johnson for not having a detailed plan to carry out Britain's complex divorce from the European Union.\n\n\"This prime minister claims he has a strategy, but he can't tell us what it is,\" Corbyn said.\n\nHe then accused Johnson of wanting to enter a \"deeply unpalatable\" deal that would push Britain \"into the arms of a trade deal with Donald Trump that will put America first and Britain a distant second.\"\n\nThe measure now heads to the House of Lords, Parliament's upper chamber, where it faces scores of amendments but is expected to pass.\n\nSupporters of Benn's plan hope to get the bill passed into law quickly, perhaps by week's end. They hope to do so before Johnson moves to suspend Parliament, a move approved by Queen Elizabeth II last week.\n\nIf it takes place, the suspension would go into effect next week through Oct. 14, the day before Johnson had hoped to hold national elections.\n\nNPR's Frank Langfitt contributed to this report from London.", "description": "The prime minister failed to garner the two-thirds of members necessary for an election he wanted to hold on Oct. 15.", "authors": ["Bill Chappell", "Brakkton Booker"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/04/ap_19247549531287_wide-e28c5b047b11ff186c838ed1c1a3ea8b918b165d.jpg?s=1400"}
