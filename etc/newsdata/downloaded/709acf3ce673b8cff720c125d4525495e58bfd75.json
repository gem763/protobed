As a result, without explanation, Crockford was ousted from her position at the university.\n\nIn an interview with Crockford this week for Breitbart News, I ask: \u2018Do you think you\u2019ve been blacklisted for telling inconvenient truths?\u2019\n\nShe replies:\n\n\u201cOh I absolutely do.\u201d\n\nCrockford\u2019s \u201ccrime\u201d was to point out that contrary to environmentalists\u2019 computer projections, polar bear populations have increased, not decreased \u2014 despite \u201cglobal warming\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was that in 2007 there was a prediction that when sea ice declined to about 42 per cent below what it would have been in 1979 that two-thirds of the polar bears in the world would be gone. That would be 10 out of the 19 sub populations that exist. But what has happened, we find from research, is that bear numbers have not gone down but in fact have gone up by at least 16 per cent and probably more. So the bears are thriving despite the fact that sea ice has declined dramatically.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cpolar bears starving because of melting sea ice\u201d story has been a staple of the green scare narrative.\n\nIn 2017, for example, footage of an emaciated polar bear rummaging pitifully through trash cans became a huge international story.\n\nThe video for National Geographic attracted over two million views. It was set to tear-jerking music and accompanied by the utterly dishonest and misleading message \u201cThis is what climate change looks like.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as Crockford explains, this was the purest green #FakeNews.\n\n\u201cStarving is the leading natural cause of death for polar bears. It just happens.\u201d\n\nIf the polar bear was starving to death, it was likely the result of its being old or sick \u2014 not because of melting summer sea ice.\n\nCrockford says:\n\n\u201cPolar bears do most of their feeding in the spring time, not the summer. Starving polar bears don\u2019t tell us anything about populations.\u201d", "description": "A Canadian university has frozen a zoologist out of her post as punishment for saying the unsayable about polar bears.", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/polar-bear-thrives-in-canada-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
