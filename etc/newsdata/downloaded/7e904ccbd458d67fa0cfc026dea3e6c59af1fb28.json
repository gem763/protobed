He said Petersen sounded depressed and distraught during the last call, and brought up Trudeau's name after no previous mentions of politics.\n\nSveinson recalled Petersen's exact words as being: \"Between you and me, I'd like to take a shot at Trudeau,\" and, \"I don't want to be the guy that goes and blows up Parliament.\" Sveinson said the sad, quick demeanour of Petersen's voice caused him concern for Petersen's well-being. Sveinson then contacted a department manager.\n\nSveinson also testified the call had initially been about Petersen's life insurance, and that caused Sveinson to believe it was a suicide call.\n\nHarradence said there was a hole in the evidence about how Trudeau and the Parliament Buildings came into conversation.\n\n\"Context is critical,\" Harradence said.\n\nThe trial also saw video of Const. Tanner Gillies from the Saskatchewan National Security Enforcement Section interviewing Petersen.\n\nPetersen told Gillies during the interview the \"take a shot\" comment meant he would punch Trudeau in the nose if he was in front of him, not shoot him. He said he wouldn't shoot Trudeau due to a moral belief that killing another human is wrong.\n\nGillies said in court that while Petersen appeared stressed and was sober, he didn't think he was a threat to Trudeau.", "description": "A Saskatchewan man accused of threatening to shoot Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and blow up Canada's Parliament buildings earlier this year has been acquitted.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5278609.1568159081!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/sask-trudeau-threat-20190910.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
