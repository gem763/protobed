That all comes to an end on Sunday.\n\nThe Raiders are the last NFL team sharing a stadium with a baseball team, and this is their last season playing on the same field as the Oakland Athletics. Sunday\u2019s home game against the Chiefs will be the Raiders\u2019 last game in Oakland during baseball season, and therefore the NFL\u2019s last game on a baseball infield.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s game against the Chiefs, the Raiders are on the road Weeks 3-4, have a \u201chome\u201d game in London Week 5, their bye Week 6 and on the road Weeks 7-8. By the time they play in Oakland again, Week 9, baseball season is over.\n\nPlayers have never liked having to play on dirt, and NFL teams don\u2019t like having to share their stadium with MLB teams. On Sunday the NFL will forever say good riddance to the days of playing on baseball fields.", "description": "For most of the NFL's 100 seasons, some NFL teams have shared stadiums with Major League Baseball teams, which means some games are played on dirt infields.
