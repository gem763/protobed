But the only way of finding it would be to examine the DNA of the pre-colonization populations. On this tropical island, ancient DNA, which degrades rapidly in heat and humidity, is hard to come by. But Nieves-Col\u00f3n has spent the past decade looking for it, and her work backs up the counter-narrative.\n\nThere was already some genetic evidence to support the idea of Ta\u00edno survival. In 2001, Juan Carlos Mart\u00ednez-Cruzado of the University of Puerto Rico analyzed modern Puerto Ricans and found substantial amounts of Native American ancestry in their mitochondrial genomes\u2014a subset of DNA that\u2019s inherited from mothers. \u201cThe Ta\u00edno contribution to the current population is considerable,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRead: Scientists can now pull the DNA of ancient humans out of cave dirt\n\nBut such ancestry can be hard to interpret because European colonizers moved people around. \u201cIn contemporary populations, when indigenous ancestry is found, you can only say that it\u2019s indigenous to the Americas,\u201d says Jada Benn Torres of Vanderbilt University, who studies the genetic ancestry of indigenous Caribbean peoples. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint it to one particular area.\u201d That\u2019s why the ancient DNA is necessary.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Nieves-Col\u00f3n has been working to wrest tiny fragments of DNA from ancient remains. From three archaeological sites on the island, she and her colleagues acquired 124 skeletal remains, which all dated between A.D. 500 and 1300. They then searched teeth, bones, and dental plaque for genetic fragments\u2014a difficult task, since DNA breaks down quickly and readily in tropical conditions.\n\nStill, the team managed to completely decipher the mitochondrial genomes from 45 precontact people, and partial nuclear genomes from two of them.\n\nThese hard-won sequences confirmed that indigenous Puerto Ricans were strongly connected to Amazonian groups from Venezuela and Colombia, and likely originated from that region. They also contained genetic evidence connecting pre-colonial populations with modern ones.\n\nThe team found that the 45 ancient mitochondrial genomes fell into 29 distinctive clusters. Most of these have never been detected in modern-day people across the Caribbean, and may well have disappeared. But three of them did survive: They\u2019re still around in the genomes of today\u2019s Puerto Ricans, and only in Puerto Ricans.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have expected that if the ancient narrative [of extinction] was completely true,\u201d says Nieves-Col\u00f3n. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t disappear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis shows that there really are ties to populations that are indigenous to the island, and survived through colonization, and are present in modern peoples,\u201d adds Benn Torres. \u201cThis is something that some people have said all along, based on their oral histories and other ways of knowing.\u201d", "description": "The people of pre-colonial Puerto Rico did not disappear entirely\u2014a new study shows that the island\u2019s residents still carry bits of their DNA.", "authors": ["Ed Yong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX71ZYU/facebook.jpg?1568775460", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
