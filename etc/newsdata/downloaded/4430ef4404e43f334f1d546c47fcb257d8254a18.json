What is evident already, however, is that several of the arguments being used to absolve the president are, to say the least, lacking in substance.\n\n1. The impeachment inquiry itself is unconstitutional\n\nOn Tuesday, White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote a letter to House Democratic leaders that cited the U.S. Constitution in defense of the president\u2019s decision to undermine the checks and balances written into it.\n\n\u201cIn order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch and all future occupants of the Office of the presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances,\u201d Cipollone wrote.\n\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution states that \u201cthe President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d The Constitution gives the House of Representatives the authority to impeach a president. Removal from office requires a subsequent trial and conviction by a two-thirds majority of the Senate.\n\n2. \u2018The Biden family was PAID OFF\u2019\n\nAs news broke that Trump had withheld U.S. military aid from Ukraine days before requesting Zelensky\u2019s cooperation in an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter, the president began claiming that he was seeking to root out corruption. In an Oct. 6 tweet, for instance, Trump suggested that Biden and his son received corrupt payments from a Ukrainian natural-gas company and a Chinese investment fund.\n\nIt is INCREDIBLE to watch and read the Fake News and how they pull out all stops to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and his thrown out of the Military son, Hunter, who was handed $100,000 a month (Plus,Plus) from a Ukrainian based company, even though he had no experience in energy,... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2019\n\n....and separately got 1.5 Billion Dollars from China despite no experience and for no apparent reason. There is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions? As lawyers & others have stated, as President, I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2019\n\nThe Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable. Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2019\n\nFirst, while there\u2019s little dispute that Hunter Biden was recruited for the board of directors of the Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings at least in part because of his powerful father, he was paid $50,000 per month, not $100,000. Trump also grossly exaggerates Hunter Biden\u2019s earnings from his work with the Chinese-American investment firm Bohai Harvest RST. While that firm sought to raise $1.5 billion in capital, it registered just $4.2 million. Hunter Biden owns a 10 percent stake in the company worth approximately $420,000 today.", "description": "As Democrats continue their impeachment inquiry, the president and his allies keep presenting certain misleading defenses.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aI4z18i_HkaL_19T42SLEw--~B/aD0xNjE0O3c9MjUwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/541d2090-eac6-11e9-8f53-d0ec526ff77b", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
