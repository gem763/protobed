Forwards and backwards he paced, trying to harness his emotions.\n\nA few yards away, Adrian San Miguel, Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper, was similarly fidgety. The action was unfolding at the other end of the pitch but he prowled around his penalty area and looked towards the scoreboard in the corner of a stadium that was crackling with tension.\n\nIt showed the score was Liverpool 1 Leicester City 1 but here they were in the 93rd minute with a moment that, potentially, had ramifications for the entire season. Such was the importance, the first Saturday in October suddenly felt like the final Saturday in April.\n\nJames Milner kept his cool to tuck away an injury-time penalty as Liverpool beat Leicester 2-1\n\nMilner's penalty felt like a decisive moment in title race despite the fact it's only October\n\nJames Maddison thought he'd won a point for Leicester after his 80th minute goal made it 1-1\n\nSadio Mane had put Liverpool in front with a well taken finish on 40 minutes\n\nMarc Albrighton had panicked and kicked Sadio Mane. The Senegal forward, who had scored Liverpool\u2019s opening goal, accepted the contact and \u2018won\u2019 a penalty. This was a reprieve, an opportunity and a blessing rolled into one.\n\nJamie Redknapp: James Milner was the coolest man in Anfield...he's a freak of nature! James is an incredible specimen. I played golf with the Liverpool midfielder about six months ago and the guy has got muscles on top of muscles. He is a freak of nature (in the nicest way possible!) and an athlete. That is down to his devotion to staying fit and playing football at the highest level. He doesn\u2019t drink and he doesn\u2019t put in half shifts at training. Milner looks after himself and he is a manager\u2019s dream. On Saturday, he was the coolest man in Anfield as he stepped up to take their 95th-minute penalty. Milner coped with the delay while VAR checked the supposed foul, then put it away like the old pro he is. That might be a key moment Liverpool look back on if they go on to win the title, especially given the points dropped by Manchester City yesterday.\n\nMissing from 12 yards would have been received like the end of the world. Muffled groans had become audible as passes went astray following James Maddison\u2019s 80th- minute equaliser. Liverpool were faced with dropping points for the first time since March 3. Then up stepped James Milner.\n\n\u2018He is very cool and calm,\u2019 Brendan Rodgers, Leicester\u2019s manager, said through gritted teeth. \u2018He doesn\u2019t miss.\u2019\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t miss. Milner ignored the commotion, puffed out his checks and zipped his spot-kick into the Anfield Road net to spark bedlam. Klopp set off like an Olympic sprinter, waving his arms and screaming: \u2018Come on!\u2019; Mane, meanwhile, fell to the floor and looked to the heavens.\n\nThe scene needs this detail to give an idea of what was at stake.\n\nOf course, all this was before City were ransacked at the Etihad Stadium by Wolves. The penalty extended Liverpool\u2019s lead to eight points. But a missed spot-kick and it would have been six with all expectation that it would have been cut to three by Sunday night. Very much nip and tuck.\n\nA week previously at Goodison Park, Manchester City celebrated with similar gusto to Liverpool on Saturday when they chiselled out a late win. Such is the quality of this title race, these sides have redefined what constitutes a good result.\n\nIn normal circumstances, a point against Leicester would be acceptable. Rodgers is building a progressive and attractive side, one that will finish in the top six. But this is the face-off in which neither rival is expected to blink, so a Liverpool draw would have felt like a calamity. We are watching football \u2014 or results \u2014 like never before. When Manchester United and Arsenal were going head-to-head around the turn of the millennium, they would always have a sticky spell in a season that lasted three or four games.\n\nLiverpool and City have been operating at such levels that you notice when they have a sticky 45 minutes. That\u2019s why City\u2019s defeat must have felt so huge at Anfield. The implications of false steps are huge.\n\n\u2018It is true,\u2019 Klopp responded, when asked if it felt more like the title run-in than the beginning of autumn. \u2018It is our life. I saw Middlesbrough v Birmingham on Friday, a Championship game, and it was like it was the last game of the season and they were fighting against relegation.\n\n\u2018End to end football, all the players in one box and then all in the other box. That\u2019s how it is. All or nothing. I was really pleased about our performance. Their goal was a nice one. We had to stay in the game and we did that.\u2019\n\nJurgen Klopp's animated celebrations showed the importance of Liverpool's late win\n\nLeicester, with good reason, went home seething. Most players darted for the team coach and Jamie Vardy articulated the emotion in the dressing room when saying: \u2018I\u2019ll get myself into trouble\u2019 if he stopped to discuss the award of Liverpool\u2019s penalty and a melee at the final whistle.\n\nIt was, in some ways, a throwback to a different era. Modern football can be sanitised but this was a contest that teetered on the edge, so much so that Liverpool left back Andy Robertson was prepared to settle his differences with Leicester substitute Ayoze Perez in the tunnel.\n\nKlopp needs to ensure that Liverpool\u2019s fight does not boil over but what is noticeable about this squad this year is the single-minded way they are approaching every fixture: tick one off, move on to the next one.\n\nFor the past 18 months, they have been praised for the way in which they have blitzed opponents but Liverpool know style alone won\u2019t get them what they want.\n\nYou could not help but feel that the 93rd minute of this fixture with Leicester \u2014 and the resulting noise and the subsequent result at the Etihad \u2014 will end up being factors in the final reckoning.\n\n\u2018We fight hard to win,\u2019 said midfielder Gini Wijnaldum. \u2018This was difficult until the end.\u2019", "description": "DOMINIC KING AT ANFIELD: Jurgen Klopp folded his arms tightly and spun to face the Kop.
