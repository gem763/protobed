To the contrary, it\u2019s part of the ongoing backlash to a type of public shaming that has come to be called \u201ccancel culture.\u201d As The Washington Post\u2019s Abby Ohlheiser and Elahe Izadi explain it, canceling involves \u201cshaming a public figure for alleged wrongdoing, and advocating for them to lose access to their platform.\u201d This is nothing new \u2014 boycotts have been around for a long time \u2014 but the \u201cculture\u201d part refers to the role of social media, where public campaigns can grow larger and faster than in the pre-Internet era.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut cancel culture is best understood through its critics, from social media pundits such as Ben Shapiro and Claire Lehmann to a growing chorus of mainstream writers like Bari Weiss and Bret Stephens. There you will find a familiar line of argument: Once upon a time, Americans tolerated, and even embraced, uncomfortable views and \u201cproblematic\u201d people. But, now, when someone is ratioed on Twitter or protested at a panel discussion or booed during a comedy set, it supposedly offers evidence that people are afraid of ideas that challenge them. In casting out those they disagree with, cancel culture\u2019s critics argue, the public is excluding the very ideas it needs most.\n\nStrip away this intellectual gauze, and the critics of cancel culture have a pretty simple argument, one Yascha Mounk recently endorsed in the Atlantic: \u201cIf everyone always agrees with you, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\u201d In other words, don\u2019t trust your own opinions! Unless you reflexively heed those who you dislike, no matter how good a reason you have for shunning them, you\u2019re doomed to live as an intellectual sheep.\n\nThis sentiment is more than just petty contrarianism. Apply it in the real world, and it becomes clear that contempt for cancel culture is little more than contempt for democracy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter all, what is derided as \u201ccancel culture\u201d is nothing more than a large group of people choosing who and what they want to watch, read and listen to. Though \u201ccanceling\u201d on its own suggests the work of the anonymous censor or autocratic TV exec, \u201ccancel culture\u201d reflects the opposite: the public and democratic engagement of ordinary people.\n\nWhile our society rightly values protest and free expression, the critics of \u201ccancel culture\u201d turn this virtue into a vice, contemptuously dismissing those who collectively express their disapproval. Take comedy, where performers have leaped to the hyperbolic defense of colleagues facing public outcry for allegedly committing sexual abuse and making hateful, derogatory comments to marginalized groups. While the long-standing rule of comedy is that if audiences aren\u2019t laughing, you should change your material, comedians have had a quite different reaction to Shane Gillis\u2019s ouster last month from \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 after videos of him using racial slurs and disparaging Asians and Muslims went viral \u2014 with Rob Schneider calling it an \u201cintolerable inquisition\u201d and Sarah Silverman condemning a \u201cmutated McCarthy era, where any comic better watch anything they say.\u201d\n\nStand-up comedy\u2019s relationship to ordinary audiences has historically yielded performers who\u2019ve deviated from stuffy, elite norms \u2014 think of Lenny Bruce, George Carlin and Richard Pryor. But today, \u201ccancel culture\u201d is used as a bludgeon for the opposite purpose: punishing audiences who dare not to laugh at jokes. In condemning the general public for their taste in comedy, the critics of cancel culture are rejecting the very idea of free choice in artistic taste.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is most harrowing about contempt for \u201ccancel culture\u201d is how its anti-democratic attitudes have crept into politics. When Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) resigned from office in January 2018 after allegations of sexual misconduct, Democrats were divided on whether he had responded appropriately to public outcry or was the victim of a witch hunt. In July, the New Yorker\u2019s Jane Meyer provided fodder for those of the latter opinion in a profile that portrayed him as \u201crailroaded\u201d and cast doubt on one accuser (though there have been others, including a woman who came forward just last month). Since then, prominent Democrats such as Sens. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) have come forward as regretful of Franken\u2019s departure from the Senate \u2014 never mind that the resignation was his choice and a Democrat was duly elected in his place.\n\nMissing from the spate of mea culpas for Franken\u2019s career (which seems at least partially intact, as he returns to the SiriusXM airways) is just how popular the senator\u2019s exit from public office actually was. In November 2017, after the first sexual harassment allegations were leveled, only 22 percent of voters in Minnesota and across the country supported Franken remaining in office. In a democracy it is only logical for politicians to respect the will of the electorate, which is why many Democrats have called for President Trump to step down or be impeached and removed from office, as a growing share of voters say the same. But in regretting Franken\u2019s departure from the Senate, too many Democrats are buying into one of the most clearly anti-democratic critiques of \u201ccancel culture\u201d: When it comes to powerful people, especially white men, the public simply can\u2019t be trusted to decide who they should listen to.\n\nIt is a supreme irony that some of the most vocal critics of cancel culture claim to be acting in the interest of democracy. Stephens, a columnist for the New York Times, for instance, wrote a column implying that Twitter criticism of him (for trying to get one of his own critics fired) was equivalent to Nazi propaganda. As laughable as this seems, it gets to the heart of what criticism of cancel culture is about: a contempt for the marginalized majority, the ordinary people who make once-secure elites feel uncomfortable as they have to face their own unpopularity. It\u2019s no coincidence that many of the critics of cancel culture take billionaire money to suppress the speech of their political opponents, all the while inventing an imagined racist majority to legitimize their own heinous, unpopular views.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocracy is not just about the ballot box: It is a vision of society in which the will of the people \u2014 all of us \u2014 is supreme. We need more of it, not less, not only in our politics, but also in our workplaces, our media, our culture. It\u2019s a shame that critics like Mounk, whose scholarship looks at how to strengthen democracy, do not recognize the radical vision of people power lying in plain sight: It\u2019s called \u201ccancel culture,\u201d and it might just be playing out in a Twitter ratio near you.\n\nAD", "description": "The phenomenon derided as \u201ccancel culture\u201d is nothing more than a large group of people choosing who and what they want to watch, read and listen to.", "authors": ["Aaron Freedman", "Aaron Freedman Is A Writer Based In Brooklyn"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mnkoXlJu5D7ApNd0-m6nWVP4PGo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FRA4WLHV2II6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
