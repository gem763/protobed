Accused of inviting a foreign government to interfere in American democracy, he tweeted about \u201ca total witch-hunt scam by the Democrats\u201d and claimed \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d.\n\nStephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, followed up with a statement that Democrats\u2019 \u201cattacks on the President and his agenda are not only partisan and pathetic, they are in dereliction of their Constitutional duty\u201d.\n\nAt the sound of the klaxon, Trump\u2019s troops ran to their battle stations. His son Donald Trump Jr and lawyer Rudy Giuliani used a favourite tactic of accusing the accusers, recycling baseless allegations against Biden.\n\nDon Jr tweeted: \u201cAmazing that Biden gets the pass on using his office to enrich his son, but the mere chance to somehow make it about @realDonaldTrump is all the Dems need to go all out. JOKERS!\u201d\n\nGiuliani added: \u201cDems have no basis for impeachment. They should be investigated for obstructing justice. Their whistleblower may turn out to have no direct evidence. The story is so far off it sounds like another Dem-Media frame-up. Only crimes are Biden-Kerry pay for play. Thank you.\u201d\n\nNo evidence has emerged to support Trump\u2019s claims that Biden improperly used his position as vice-president to push out a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to help his son.\n\nRepublicans shrugged off the central allegation that Trump pressured the leader of Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2019s son after withholding military aid. They made clear that, even if Trump is impeached by the House of Representatives, they have no intention of convicting him in the Senate and removing him from office.\n\nQ&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. With a full house, that requires 218 of the 435 representatives to vote. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the United States then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote against them. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Three presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither were removed from office. Richard Nixon was also impeached, but resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote. Martin Belam\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, accused Democrats of a rush to judgment. \u201cIt simply confirms that House Democrats\u2019 priority is not making life better for the American people but their nearly three-year-old fixation on impeachment,\u201d he said.\n\nA slew of other Republicans issued statements joining the condemnation. Liz Cheney, chair of the House Republican conference and daughter of the former vice-president Dick Cheney, accused Pelosi of jumping the gun without firm evidence. \u201cShe has announced a formal impeachment inquiry of the President of the United States based on news reports of a phone call and a whistleblower,\u201d Cheney said of the speaker.\n\n\u201cThe Speaker and House Democrats have lost all credibility and, most tragically, have abdicated their duty to the Constitution and to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee was also circling the wagons. Steve Guest, its rapid response director, wrote in an email: \u201cThe Democrat-led impeachment inquiry is not based on facts, it solely stems from their political vendetta against President Trump.\n\n\u201cReminder: Democrats already tried once with a failed Russia hoax and as we all know: No Collusion. No Obstruction. So now they cooked up a ridiculous Ukraine hoax even before they have read the transcript of the call.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the Trump-Pence campaign for 2020 sent out fundraising emails. One began: \u201cNancy Pelosi just formally called for the first step towards my impeachment! This is just another smear job and pathetic attempt by Democrats to rip the power from the people. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Trust me, you\u2019ll see the transcript.\u201d\n\nIt announced the launch of the \u201cOfficial Impeachment Defense Task Force\u201d and sought donations.\n\nSome Democrats have long feared that impeachment could backfire by rallying Trump\u2019s base and deepening a sentiment of \u201cus versus them\u201d. Trump\u2019s backers certainly hope so. Brad Parscale, his 2020 campaign manager, said: \u201cDemocrats can\u2019t beat President Trump on his policies or his stellar record of accomplishment, so they\u2019re trying to turn a Joe Biden scandal into a Trump problem.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, Tucker Carlson, a host on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News network, played dazed and confused, saying he had been trying all day to understand what Democrats were alleging. \u201cEven allowing for the hysteria of the moment,\u201d he said, \u201cthis seems pretty reckless.\u201d\n\nAn hour later, his fellow host Sean Hannity, who is friendly with Trump, was predictably incensed. \u201cThe psychotic anti-Trump hysteria, it has now completely overtaken the entire Democratic party,\u201d he told viewers. \u201cWhat is happening is dangerous to this country. It is grossly political, will forever alter how any president in the future in his constitutional role as commander-in-chief will be able to communicate freely with other world leaders.\u201d\n\nAn entire rightwing ecosystem had kicked in, demonstrating how difficult it will be for the impeachment case to penetrate the Trump universe. Kurt Bardella, the president of the strategic communications firm Endeavor Strategies and a former congressional aide, said the entire Trump presidency had proved \u201cnothing will deter the majority of Republicans and their propaganda platforms from standing by their man.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s support of a serial sexual predator like Roy Moore didn\u2019t do it. Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine our democracy didn\u2019t do it. Trump\u2019s relentless campaign to profit from his presidency didn\u2019t do it. Trump\u2019s blatant displays of racism didn\u2019t do it. Certainly the president\u2019s plot to hold foreign aid hostage in order to extort an investigation into a political rival won\u2019t change the equation for the GOP.\u201d", "description": "Republicans were ready to weaponise Pelosi\u2019s announcement against her, Biden and other Democrats", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a17d7d640a3c8699c65828877f9f410f7635922/0_0_3442_2066/master/3442.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9876ac20d221a28cb938dc4833c636d", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
