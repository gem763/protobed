And sometimes the mistakes seem downright unkind\n\nI do not drink the coffee in Starbucks because it doesn\u2019t taste good. But even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t, for another reason: my name. Because if you\u2019re a half-Turkish, half-Iranian second-generation immigrant like I am, it means you have a name that few can pronounce, and which even your parents can\u2019t agree how to spell. (My father spells it with a Sh, my mother with an \u015e. In their defence, they don\u2019t agree on much.)\n\nWhen your own parents can\u2019t agree on the spelling of your name, and beloved co-workers continue to get it wrong after years of gentle admonishing \u2013 well, I\u2019d rather not have to go through the rigmarole of painstakingly spelling it out to a barista. In the past, when ordering an iced caramel frappuccino from Starbucks (I am not proud of this drink choice, but there we are), the conversation has gone a lot like this: \u201cSirin ... No, S-I-R-I-N ... pronounced Shirin. No, not like Ed Sheeran. SIRIN.\u201d (Is presented with a cup with \u201cSharon\u201d written on it.) Which is why I have the utmost sympathy with the 25-year-old admin worker and Starbucks patron Nadia Khan.\n\nLast week, Khan ordered a cookies-and-cream frappuccino from the Feltham, west London branch of Starbucks and was asked \u2013 as is standard practice in outlets of the coffee chain \u2013 to give her name for the order. When her drink was brought to her with \u201cHippo\u201d scrawled in permanent marker across the side, Khan\u2019s mother went \u201cabsolutely ballistic\u201d, and confronted the employee. \u201cMum told him he should treat customers with respect, no matter how skinny, fat or whatever,\u201d Khan told the Daily Mirror. Starbucks subsequently apologised, and said it would be \u201cworking closely with the store team to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again\u201d.\n\nI wish Starbucks would rethink their naming policy. This isn\u2019t the first time name-related mishaps have occured. Social media is full of claims of Starbucks staff spelling people\u2019s names wrong \u2013 from the Philadelphia man who told workers his name was Aziz, but received a cup with \u201cIsis\u201d written on it (Starbucks apologised but he is considering legal action) to a woman called Ann-Louise who was given a cup with \u201cAnus\u201d written on it.\n\nIf your name is unusual, or not of English origin, it\u2019s almost inevitable that it will be misspelled by your barista. It\u2019s exasperating to have to repeatedly spell it out front of a queue of people. Starbucks claims its policy helps it to \u201cconnect with customers\u201d, but grotesquely misnaming someone is more the sort of behaviour I expect from one-night stands.\n\nDitch the names, Starbucks, and I\u2019ll be first through your doors. If you improve the coffee too, that is.", "description": "If your name is unusual, it\u2019s almost inevitable the barista will misspell it on the side of your coffee cup.
