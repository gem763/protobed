Pin, a 14-year-old girl who dresses as a boy, is her unlikely heroine. Pin\u2019s mother, a fortuneteller working at the amusement park, offered her daughter a masculine disguise to protect her after Pin\u2019s younger sister, Abriana, went missing. But the disguise is an unexpected gift to Pin, for whom \u201cbeing a girl was like a huge scab she couldn\u2019t scrape off, no matter how hard she tried.\u201d In her new clothes, she finds that \u201cbeing a boy meant freedom,\u201d and that unlike other secrets she harbors, this one \u201cmade her feel bigger, not smaller.\u201d\n\nAs a boy, Pin navigates the freewheeling carnival culture with bravado. She (in her own thoughts, Pin refers to herself in the feminine) picks up spending money by running drugs for Max, a man who performs at the carnival as \u201cMax and Maxene, She-Male.\u201d For his act he dresses as a woman on his left side and as a man on the right, and turns slowly from one side to the other in front of a delighted and horrified audience. He\u2019s fascinating and terrifying to Pin, as well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPin\u2019s delivery route takes her all over Chicago, including an abortion clinic, a jazz club and a university. She makes a regular stop at a film studio where she delivers dope to Lionel, a photoplay writer who is fascinated by tales of lurid crimes and keeps a notebook filled with ideas ripped from the headlines. Gloria, an actress at the film studio, takes a liking to Pin; Pin responds with powerfully forbidden feelings of her own. Charlie Chaplin even puts in an appearance, making his own play for Gloria or any other young actress who will accept his attention.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated world for young Pin, and it becomes even more complicated when she witnesses a crime while lingering around Hell Gate, a ride that takes thrill-seekers through a dark and spooky canal on little boats. It\u2019s popular among couples seeking a few moments alone together in the dark, but as Pin watches couples embark and disembark, she notices something else: one girl who went in with an older man and didn\u2019t come out the other side. When no one believes her, Pin undertakes an investigation herself.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no question that something horrible has happened, because the villain himself is present in this novel as a nameless, anonymous man whose identity is concealed from the reader as he commits his crimes. Hand throws in enough misdirection to make him look like everyone else in the novel \u2014 even Chaplin \u2014 so that everyone is a suspect, and no one can be relied upon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith short, breathlessly paced chapters and constantly shifting points of view, \u201cCurious Toys\u201d is itself like a carnival ride: alternatively dazzling and terrifying, disorienting and marvelous. When the girl\u2019s disappearance becomes public knowledge, we follow an ex-cop, Francis Bacon, who works security at the carnival in the summer and serves as a department store detective in winter. Francis conducts his own investigation, but he\u2019s oblivious to the underworld that Pin traverses so deftly.\n\nIt\u2019s in this underworld that Pin meets the real-life outsider artist Henry Darger. Darger was in and out of institutions as a boy, lived an impoverished life in Chicago, and left behind an epic illustrated novel spanning 15,000 pages (among many other works) when he died. This prolific unschooled artist is recognized today as one of America\u2019s great folk artists, but he died unknown. Hand has been fascinated with Darger for decades, and places him at the center of this novel as another amateur detective who teams up \u2014 in his own awkward, puzzling, shambling way \u2014 with Pin to solve the case of the missing girl. It\u2019s a fitting storyline for Darger, who was obsessed with the death and disappearance of a little girl in 1911. He cherished a newspaper photograph of the girl, and when he lost it, his grief and rage inspired his frantic, prolific work.\n\nDarger\u2019s work also explored themes of sexuality and gender identity, themes that are expanded and amplified in \u201cCurious Toys.\u201d In Pin\u2019s world, girls are fragile, vulnerable, under attack and powerless to defend themselves. A boy\u2019s identity acts as a kind of invisibility cloak to Pin, assuring her safe passage through a world that neither values nor protects her otherwise. In her search for the killer, Pin fights to take a dangerous man off the street and comes to grips with her own sister\u2019s disappearance. But she\u2019s not just trying to solve the case \u2014 she\u2019s trying to solve the puzzle of her own identity, and to save herself.\n\nAmy Stewart is the author, most recently, of the novel \u201cKopp Sisters on the March.\u201d\n\nAt 7 p.m. on Oct. 17, Elizabeth Hand will be in conversation with critic Michael Dirda at Solid State Books, 600 H St. NE, Washington.\n\nCURIOUS TOYS\n\nBy Elizabeth Hand\n\nMulholland. 384 pp. $27\n\nAD", "description": "Elizabeth Hand\u2019s novel is both a mystery and a fascinating exploration of gender.", "authors": ["Amy Stewart"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6gvhYhbew2LX9hRZZ-FdqUlXaRs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B3T2R2HLS4I6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
