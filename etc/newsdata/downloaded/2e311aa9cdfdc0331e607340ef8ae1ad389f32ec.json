Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.\n\nHealey in 2016 issued a so-called civil investigative demand to Exxon seeking documents to determine whether it had violated Massachusetts consumer-protection law through its marketing and sale of fossil fuel products.\n\nThe company fought the records request, and while courts have sided with Healey, the company to this day has not provided her office any records. The state built its lawsuit on evidence from other sources, including New York's case, Healey said.\n\nIn its 2018 lawsuit, New York accuses Exxon of falsely telling investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business, defrauding investors out of up to $1.6 billion.\n\nExxon denies wrongdoing and says it has a robust system to manage the risk of increasing climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Chris Reese, David Gregorio, Cynthia Osterman and Lincoln Feast.)", "description": "The state of Massachusetts sued Exxon Mobil Corp  on Thursday, accusing the oil giant of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change.
