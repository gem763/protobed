This follows a $115 million bet against the company by Mapleline Capital in February.\n\nThe fund and Adyen declined to comment.\n\nIt's at least the second big short position AQR, which is a systematic manager that uses algorithms to determine its investments, has made in the payments sector. Breakout Point's data show that AQR also has a $71 million short on French payments company Worldline, which it made in August. No other hedge fund has a current short position this big in either company.\n\nWorldline did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSee more: $183 million short-seller Spruce Point is targeting the maker of Trojan condoms and Arm & Hammer baking soda\n\nAQR has not always been negative on the prospects of the growing European payments space, records show. These are the first short positions they have taken in the space, according to Breakout Point.\n\nThe firm doesn't do traditional fundamental reviews of companies, instead investing based on different factors in the manager's algorithm-led strategies. AQR also made bets against companies linked to Woodford Capital, the fund run by Neil Woodford that blew up over illiquid investments earlier this year.\n\nSee more: Citadel is the among hedge funds piling into shorts bets on European banks as record-low rates crush financial firms\n\n", "description": "AQR has a $104 million bet against one-time unicorn Adyen and a $71 million short position in French payments company Worldline, according to Breakout Point.", "authors": ["Bradley Saacks"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e424b2e22af1f530ba0b5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
