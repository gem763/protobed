The \u201ckeep it in the ground\u201d folks scored another victory this week when the city of San Jose California voted to ban natural gas lines and appliances in all new construction projects going forward. This is allegedly part of the state-mandated goal of going 100% \u201ccarbon-free\u201d by 2045. Of course, as with all things, the devil is in the details. (CBS San Francisco)\n\nSan Jose became the biggest U.S. city to ban natural gas in new construction projects as the city council unanimously approved the proposal Tuesday evening. The so-called reach code targets appliances that use natural gas\u2013stoves, water heaters and furnaces in buildings. The city says these appliances accounts for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The passed ordinance will ban natural gas in the construction of new accessory dwelling units, new single family homes and new low rise and multifamily buildings.\n\nSan Jose may be the largest city to do this so far, but they\u2019 hardly the first. Berkeley voted to do the same thing earlier this year to loud cheers from the environmentalist community. (But that\u2019s Berkeley we\u2019re talking about, so what did you expect?) They still have a lot of questions to answer, however, with all the pesky science nagging at their heals.\n\nConsider the fact that their entire theory runs on \u201celectrification.\u201d In addition to the natural gas ban, this same legislation will mandate that all new housing be built with outlets in the parking areas for people to recharge their electric cars. The theory here is that people without access to charging stations will be less likely to buy an electric car, and California wants everyone using those soon.\n\nSo now, all of the appliances, including furnaces, stoves, water heaters and all the rest, will be electric. And the buildings will have electric outlets where people charge their vehicles. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to realize that a considerable increase in the load on the electrical grid is coming. And where does California get their electricity? More than half of it comes from\u2026 wait for it... natural gas-fired plants.\n\nTo get rid of the natural gas plants when you\u2019ve already banned coal plants, you\u2019ve only got a few choices. Hydro is good, but California isn\u2019t exactly brimming with water. (They get about 12% of their energy from hydro and they\u2019re nearly maxed out.) Nuclear would be perfect, but they\u2019re phasing that out too. (That\u2019s another 9% they\u2019re getting ready to lose.) That pretty much leaves them with solar and wind, which accounts for roughly 24% of their current power generation. Do you really think you can go from there to 100% in a decade or two?\n\nAnd in the meantime, until they shut the natural gas plants down, they\u2019ll actually wind up burning more natural gas to create all this juice while they \u201celectrify\u201d everything. It\u2019s so brilliant on paper and yet so stupid at the bottom line. Still, they\u2019re going to keep pushing to shut down the rest of their energy generation capacity.\n\nBut hey, San Jose. You do you.
