It\u2019s it there that the Sri Lankans will try and recover form the 134-run mauling they copped in the city of churches on Sunday at the hands of Warner and Maxwell and co.\n\nIt\u2019d be daft to completely rule them out in this three-game T20 series on the basis of that first performance, though. Look at what they did in the World Cup when they looked a broken and divided rabble - they beat England, who went on to win the whole thing. Or that absurd Test win in Durban. Or sweeping Pakistan last month.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s too optimistic this time around, though. Poor old Kasun Rajitha\u2019s analysis of 0/75 - the worst in T20I history - summed it up as Australia\u2019s openers put on 122 before Warner and Maxwell added another 109 in about 25 minutes then the quicks went to work. The hosts are determined to up their game in this format with a home T20 World Cup ahead of them exactly a year from now.\n\nAhead of the toss, we already know Mitch Starc hasn\u2019t made the trip, instead attending his brother\u2019s wedding. Fair play. Big Queenslander Billy Stanlake comes into the XI. As for Sri Lanka, expect bulk changes with Dickwella and Udana the most likely inclusions.\n\n", "description": "Over-by-over report: Can Australia back up their opening win at the Gabba or will the tourists bounce back?
