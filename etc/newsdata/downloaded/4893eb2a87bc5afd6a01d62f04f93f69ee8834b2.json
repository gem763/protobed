Militants opened fire on them as soon as they got there.\n\nHelicopter gunships were firing at the bushes in that area where the militants are hiding, Iraqi army officials said. The defence ministry issued a statement of condolences calling the fallen generals martyrs and heroes.\n\nFour Iraqi police officers were killed and five wounded when Islamic State militants attacked checkpoints in the Allas oilfields area of the northern Salahuddin province late on Monday, police said earlier.\n\nIraq declared victory over the hardline Sunni militants in late 2017 after pushing them out of all territory it held in the country. They have since reverted to hit-and-run insurgency tactics aimed at destabilising the government in Baghdad.", "description": "Six police officers including two senior commanders were killed in northern Iraq on Tuesday when Islamic State militants opened fire on them during a reconnaissance mission, security sources said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
