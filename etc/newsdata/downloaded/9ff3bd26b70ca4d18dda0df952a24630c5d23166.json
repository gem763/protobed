REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer\n\nAir France-KLM said it had no immediate comment on whether it had submitted an offer for all or part of Aigle Azur, as a midday court deadline passed.\n\nJunior transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari earlier told Le Parisien that Air France-KLM \u201cappears to want to make an offer\u201d - also mentioning a likely bid from Lionel Guerin, former head of the French carrier\u2019s Hop! short-haul business.\n\nHigher fuel costs and stiffer low-cost competition have led to a wave of bankruptcies among smaller European airlines in the past three years, including Air Berlin, Germania, British-based Monarch, Latvia\u2019s Primera Air and Swiss SkyWork.\n\nAigle Azur\u2019s difficulties were compounded by the privately held carrier\u2019s over-expansion from medium-haul services focused on Algeria into long-haul destinations such as Brazil.\n\nThe French state, keen to drum up interest and save Aigle Azur\u2019s 1,200 jobs, has also flagged EasyJet and Air Caraibes parent Dubreuil Group as potential bidders.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday that a \u201cprincipal offer\u201d for Aigle Azur was being considered. The bankrupt carrier\u2019s works council was due to meet on Monday afternoon to consider any bids received.\n\nGovernment influence on Air France-KLM, in which France holds a 14.3% stake, added to investor concern that had driven the Franco-Dutch group\u2019s shares 8.5% lower by 1042GMT.\n\n\u201cThe government is likely to push them to get involved,\u201d one trader told Reuters.\n\nOfficials turned to Air France-KLM as early as April, after Aigle Azur sought help from a government agency, according to financial daily Les Echos. Its interest was piqued after the struggling carrier discussed selling valuable take-off and landing slots at Paris Orly to Spain\u2019s Vueling, the paper reported.\n\nAir France has scrambled extra Algeria flights to help repatriate the 13,000 Aigle Azur passengers still stranded by the collapse. Most will have reached their destinations by the end of the week, the junior transport minister said.", "description": "Shares in Air France-KLM fell sharply on Monday after a French minister named the airline group as a likely bidder for bankrupt carrier Aigle Azur, which left 19,000 passengers stranded after abruptly halting operations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427866534&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880KL", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
