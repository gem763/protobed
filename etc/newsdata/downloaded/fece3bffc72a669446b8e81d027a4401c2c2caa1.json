John Lewis (D-Ga.), a close friend of Cummings and fellow civil rights icon, said Thursday morning. \u201cMembers will be much more determined to pick up where Elijah left off. There can be no slowdown, or turning back.\u201d\n\nCummings has been absent from Capitol Hill for weeks, sidelined with long-lingering health issues. But he spoke by phone on a near-daily basis to other investigators, including House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), even from his hospital bed, up until this week. Cummings had previously notified Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he might not be in Washington for the next few weeks, but seemed hopeful to return in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s created a really big hole for all of us,\u201d Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) added. \u201cHe had so much more he could have given.\u201d\n\nWith Cummings absent, Pelosi tapped Schiff, a close ally, as the point person in Democrats\u2019 investigation into Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Had he been healthy, it\u2019s possible that Cummings, not Schiff, would be in that role.\n\nBut Cummings\u2019 colleagues acknowledged that his skill set \u2014 his soaring rhetoric, his mastery of committee rules and procedures, his relationships with Republicans \u2014 will be missed amid the caucus\u2019 impeachment push.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible blow to lose it, I mean just terrible,\u201d Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said of Cummings\u2019 voice, forcing back tears. \u201cHe was careful about how he used it but he wasn\u2019t shy about using it either.\u201d\n\nIn the interim, Pelosi has tapped Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) to lead the Oversight panel, though few expect her to take the role permanently. So far, there are only whispers about who will take the gavel, with some lawmakers and aides floating Oversight members like Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), a fellow member of the Congressional Black Caucus, or Connolly, another skilled messenger, to assume the post.\n\nRep. Carolyn Maloney | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo\n\nSome have speculated about the possibility of bringing in a caucus heavyweight, like Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, to fill the vacancy and lead the panel, though he is unlikely to back the idea, multiple aides said.\n\nBut the question of who will replace Cummings will soon become a weighty debate \u2014 and potentially, an intraparty clash \u2014 within the caucus over who will become one of the most public-facing figures of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t bring that voice back,\u201d said Clay on Thursday, who declined to comment when asked whether he's seeking the post. \u201cIn his legacy, I will take some of the lessons that I learned from him and convert that into my everyday work.\u201d\n\nThe late Oversight Committee chairman checked all the boxes for Democratic leaders: he was a partisan warrior but beloved by lawmakers in both parties; a star inside the caucus and on TV; a commanding force on the committee dais; and a brutally effective cross-examiner who could make even the toughest witness cringe.\n\nCummings took the top role in the Oversight Committee in 2010 \u2014 leaping over Maloney despite her seniority on the panel \u2014 as a counterpunch to then-Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), a thorn in the side of the Obama administration.\n\nIn 2014, Pelosi appointed Cummings as the top Democrat on the Benghazi select committee, a sign of her trust in the Maryland Democrat.\n\nAnd when Democrats won the House in 2018, Pelosi tapped Cummings to lead the Oversight Committee, where he quickly became one of Trump\u2019s top tormentors on the Hill. Trump attacked Cummings \u2014 a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 as \u201cracist,\u201d although the presidential barbs didn\u2019t appear to bother Cummings at all.\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to several federal crimes, including funneling payments to alleged Trump mistresses, Cummings organized a widely watched hearing featuring Cohen that Democrats say was one of the highlights of the 116th Congress.\n\n\u201cThis is not about not liking the president. It's about loving democracy. It's about loving our country,\u201d Cummings said at a July news conference with Pelosi, Schiff and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler. \u201c That's what this is all about. I'm begging, I'm begging the American people to pay attention to what is going on.\"\n\nTop Democrats grappled with the loss of the 23-year House veteran in a closed-door meeting Thursday morning, where Pelosi became emotional about her \u201cbrother from Baltimore.\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle did we know how close we were, and I don\u2019t know if he knew how close he was to the end,\u201d Pelosi told the group of Democrats, according to an aide in the room. \u201cWe will proceed with what we are doing, as he would want us to do.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Did we stand on the sidelines and say nothing? Did we play games?\u201d Cummings said on the House floor in February.\n\nSeveral Democrats emerged visibly shaken from the meeting. Rep. Sanford Bishop, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, emerged from the room wiping away tears with a handkerchief. \u201cWe lost a great man, a great legislator,\u201d the Georgia Democrat said in between sobs.\n\nThe sense of shock and grief was present for Democrats throughout the day Thursday, as the Pelosi delivered a lengthy eulogy to an unusually quiet House floor. A bouquet of white flowers sat on Cummings\u2019 usual seat in the first row of the chamber.\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), a pastor and close friend, said Cummings became so well known for his oratory skills that Cleaver would sometimes joke he was a \u201cbootleg preacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reminded him often \u2014 we laughed about it \u2014 I said \u2018you went to law school, I went to seminary. I don\u2019t try to practice law, you don\u2019t try to practice preaching,\u2019\u201d Cleaver said. \u201cWhen I really wanted to make him feel better, I would come over and call him Bishop Elijah.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/31/be/4f50f8524e60bf4380c2ebfd7477/191017-elijah-cummings-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
