We had everything planned from Plan A to Z,\" Adesanya said. \"It's unreal. They said I have no knockout power.\"\n\nWhittaker, who hadn't fought since June 2018, came out loading up his shots, catching Adesanya several times over the course of the first round with jabs, hooks and overhands. As the round progressed, though, you could see Adesanya figure out his range and begin to strike back. Adesanya saved his best for last as he dropped Whittaker to the mat with a count-right that landed flush on the jaw a split second before the horn sounded to end Round 1.\n\nAdesanya drops Whittaker as the horn sounds in round 1!

Whittaker still threw bombs, but Adesanya effortlessly slipped them, and then responded with crisp counter combinations.\n\nIt was one of those combos that spelled the end. Whittaker landed flush on the face with a straight shot, but Adesanya, in the blink of an eye, landed a counter right, and then the big blow, a left on the jaw that knocked out Whittaker and ended the bout.\n\nIsrael Adesanya defeats Robert Whittaker during UFC 243 at Marvel Stadium.

I can take it and give it back. He's right; I hate to get hit. It's stupid to get hit. I'm tough and smart. At the end of the day, my team and I were smart.\"\n\nThe victory was Adesanya's fifth finish in his seven UFC fights. Whittaker had a nine-fight winning streak, which dated back to 2014, snapped with the loss.\n\n\"My hat is off to Adesanya,\" the no-nonsense Whitaker said. \"He's very strong, I thought I was doing well and then I got caught. \u2026 I didn't get the 'W' today, but I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nAfter the bout, Adesanya called out top contender Paulo Costa, who was seated cageside and exchanged gestures with the newly crowned champ.\n\n\"You know who's next,\" Adesanya said. \"I have a heavy Ricky Martin wannabe next. Borrachinha. This is my octagon. I'm going to smash him. I want to rearrange his face.\"", "description": "Israel Adesanya obliterated Robert Whittaker to become the undisputed middleweight champion at UFC 243.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie", "Published A.M.
