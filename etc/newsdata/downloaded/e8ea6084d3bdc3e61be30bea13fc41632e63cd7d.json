It's been a long week, but I always like to ring in the weekend by doing what I do best: online shopping. To be fair, it's actually my job to research the best deals for you all each day, looking at price histories, reviews, and cross-referencing them with the products we've tested to help our readers shop smartly and save big. And today I've found some doozies\u2014from some amazing Sony headphones to a mega-popular French press, here are the top five deals on Amazon that should be on your radar.\n\n1. Lowest price ever: Amazing noise-canceling headphones with extra bass\n\nFinally some peace and quiet. (Photo: Sony)\n\nEarlier this year, Sony disrupted the noise-canceling headphone market with the release of the WH-1000XM3 noise cancelling headphones. They\u2019re our favorite noise-canceling headphones\u2014even better than Bose's insanely popular QuietComfort series\u2014and right now, there is a similar pair on sale for a great low price on Amazon. The WH-XB900N headphones are usually $248, but right now you can get them for $50 off, the best price we've ever seen. These headphones are $100 cheaper than the XM3s because they don't feature the same active noise canceling technology. But they still have noise cancelation and also offer extra bass so you can really sink into your beats, as well as 30 hours of battery life, touch controls, and Alexa and Google Assistant connectivity.\n\nGet the Sony WH-XB900N Wireless Extra Bass Headphones on Amazon for $198 (Save $52)\n\n2. Under $20: One of our favorite French presses\n\nFor the best cup of coffee you'll ever make. (Photo: Bodum)\n\nAs the cold weather approaches, making a daily Starbucks run is going to become less and less desirable. Instead, you can brew yourself a barista-level cup of joe right from the comfort of your own kitchen with a French press. This one from Bodum has a solid ranking in our list of the best French presses, as it produced a smooth, aromatic cup of coffee, and was intuitively designed. The one downside is that there's no cover in front of the pouring spout, so your coffee will cool down faster, but that shouldn't be a problem if you're making it for the family or are just a caffeine-addict yourself. Right now, you can get it for a super low price\u2014just over $15.\n\nGet the Bodum Brazil French Press Coffee Maker for $15.25 (Save $4.75)\n\n3.

For those types, a smart thermostat will be your best friend. They allow you to remotely control the temperature in your home from anywhere in the world, so you can ensure none of the fam is trying to jack up the electric bill.
