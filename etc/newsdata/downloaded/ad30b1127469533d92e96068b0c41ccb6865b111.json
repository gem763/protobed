That is, either it goes up by less than a third of a percentage point, or it goes up by 2 percentage points or more and the US economy falls into recession. Since World War II, there has never been anything in between.\n\nWhy the gap? The answer probably lies in a dynamic that Yale economist Robert Shiller describes in his new book, Narrative Economics.\n\nSuppose some minor economic shock, such as heightened uncertainty about trade policy, precipitates modest job losses. When other workers hear that their acquaintances, or their acquaintances' acquaintances, have been laid off, they worry that they could be next. So they tighten their belts a bit, eat out less, hold off on that kitchen remodelling. This reduces demand further and leads to more layoffs.\n\nPretty soon the negative narrative is pervasive and self-reinforcing, with the unemployment rate rising persistently. The Fed can't respond in time because definitive data take a while to appear, and because it takes time for monetary easing to stimulate economic activity.\n\nThere are plenty of identifiable risks that could trigger such a negative feedback loop right now. They include developments in the trade war between the US and China and the drag exerted by slowing global growth -- along with people's memories of the last deep recession, which could increase the power of gloomy narratives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis danger bolsters the argument for the Fed to ease monetary policy at this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nSuch a preemptive move will reduce the chances that the economy will slow sufficiently to hit stall speed.\n\nEven if the insurance turns out to be unnecessary, the potential consequences aren't bad. It just means that the economy will be stronger and the inflation rate will likely move more quickly back toward the Fed's 2 per cent target.\n\nDudley is a senior research scholar at Princeton University's Center for Economic Policy Studies.
