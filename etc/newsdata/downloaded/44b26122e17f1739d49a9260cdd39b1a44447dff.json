Wife is only 62, retired nurse. Looking to rebalance my Rollover IRA at Fidelity since I think it's too heavily weighted in equities (Fidelity statement says 87%) and probably has a lot of overlap between mutual funds in it. These include the following with percentages of total $ amount in account (about $160,000):\n\n\n\nFour in One Index (FFNOX) 25% 500 Index (FXAIX) 15% Balanced (FBALX) 15% Nasdaq Composite Index (FNCMX) 13% Pimco Income Fund CL A (PONAX) 13% Contrafund (FCNTX) 6% Zero Total Market Index (FZROX) 6% Vanguard Wellesley (VWINX) 4%\n\nI also have a Vanguard IRA with about $85k with approximately 75% in Total Stock Market Index Admiral Fund (VTSAX) and 25% in Wellington (VWELX)\n\nI was going to take some or all of the Contrafund and dump it into the Wellesley fund but Fidelity told me there'd be ANOTHER $75 transaction fee besides the one I paid to buy into it originally. Looking for advice on where I could move some of the more volatile money into a bond fund. I'm not into all the doomsday scenarios going around based on tweets and speculation but likewise would not like to see the portfolio wiped out should those scenarios in fact take place.\n\nAs my wife is so much younger (and prettier) than me I like to think that this portfolio (small as it may be) has at least 25 years before she would need to seriously draw down on it.\n\nI know just enough about financial markets to be dangerous, if you know what I mean.\n\nThanks in advance", "description": "Hello everyone, Background info: I'm retired, 76, relatively good health, with a California St. Teachers Pension that will continue at the same amount - 19863", "authors": ["Follower", "Participant", "Explorer"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D"}
