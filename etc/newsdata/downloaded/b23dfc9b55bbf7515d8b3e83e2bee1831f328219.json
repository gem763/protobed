Her decision to shut four US plants has clearly made him unhappy.\n\nLast week Trump unleashed his latest twitter attack on GM, incorrectly suggesting that it was the company's plants in China that were responsible for the decision to shut down the four US plants\n\n\"General Motors, which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again?\" he tweeted last Friday.\n\nJust spoke to Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors about the Lordstown Ohio plant. I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING. I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW Union \u2014 I don't care, I just want it open! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2019\n\nOnce GM is done with this round of plant closings it will have 29 US plants, down from 33. There are 27 plants in China.\n\nBut those were built to serve the Chinese market, where GM now sells more cars than it does in the United States, allowing GM to become a larger and more profitable company. And because the Chinese market has produced $16 billion in profits for GM since 2010, money spent to build cars there comes from its own operations, not from US profits.\n\nRead More", "description": "President Donald Trump met with General Motors CEO Mary Barra at the White House Thursday.
