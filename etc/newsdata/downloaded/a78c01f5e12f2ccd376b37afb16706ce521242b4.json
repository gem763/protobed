This is an example where they\u2019ve been explicit about it saying they\u2019re approaching people based on the color of their skin and the language they\u2019re speaking,\u201d attorney Emma Bond said.\n\nA New England spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to comment.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It unfolded when two agents saw a family entering a Goodwill store in Bangor, Maine. One of the agents heard Spanish being spoken and questioned family members, the Border Patrol said.\n\nThe group was questioned after leaving the store. Mateo Carmelo-Bartolo, 31, of Guatemala, was arrested after he admitted to agents that he was in the country illegally, the Border Patrol said.\n\nCarmelo-Bartolo remained in detention on Monday. His attorney, Ronald Bourget, said he was not ready to discuss the case.\n\nThe fact that the family\u2019s appearance and language were factors in their being stopped is not nearly as surprising as the fact the agent put it in writing in an affidavit, Bond said.\n\nThe affidavit said the episode unfolded when agents on patrol \u201cobserved a group of people who appeared to be of Central-American origin.\u201d Then one of the agents \u201coverhead several people speaking in Spanish\u201d in the store, the affidavit said.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court bans profiling based solely on race, and Bond said she\u2019s never seen such an admission in other border patrol affidavits in cases she\u2019s reviewed.\n\nIn Montana, two women who say they were questioned and detained for 40 minutes for speaking Spanish in 2018 sued. The agent\u2019s only reason for doing so, they said, was because of the language they were speaking while waiting in line to buy milk and eggs.\n\nThe women, who are U.S. citizens, contend the agent\u2019s actions violated their Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures and their Fifth Amendment right to due process.\n\nThe Maine case comes as the Border Patrol has increased traffic checks and other activities farther from the Canadian border under Chief Patrol Agent Jason Owens, who assumed his duties last winter at the U.S. Border Patrol in Houlton.\n\nAccording to law, the Border Patrol can conduct operations within 100 miles (160 kilometers) of the borders. Those parameters allow operations across the entire state.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The U.S. Border Patrol was suspicious about a family because they appeared to be 'Central-American origin' and because they spoke Spanish.", "authors": ["David Sharp"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/border-patrol-maine-profiling.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
