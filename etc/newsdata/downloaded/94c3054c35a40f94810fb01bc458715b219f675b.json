Walmart announced that it would ban open carry of guns in its stores.\n\nIn addition, it would discontinue selling handgun ammunition and ammunition that can be used in large-capacity clips on assault-style weapons. This was no small step.\n\nThe NRA and other gun lobbies immediately called on members to boycott Walmart.\n\nWalmart itself projected that it would lose about half of its ammunition sales with this decision and also called on the federal government to act to \u201cstrengthen background checks\u201d and to consider \u201creauthorization of the Assault Weapons ban.\u201d\n\nWalmart\u2019s action moved other retailers to act, as Kroger, the nation\u2019s largest grocery chain, CVS, Walgreens and Wegmans also announced bans on open carry. (Other chains like Target, Starbucks and Chipotle have had policies against open carry for years).\n\nThe laws on open carry and concealed carry of handguns vary from state to state, but open carry is legal in most states, often without any requirement for a permit.\n\nWalmart\u2019s example should now lead to a broader nonviolent movement to limit the carrying of guns, even as citizens push for legislative reforms at the state and national level.\n\nIn many states, like Texas, open carry is legal in churches. Churches across the country should follow Walmart\u2019s lead and post signs banning the carrying of guns \u2014 open or concealed \u2014 on church property.\n\nOn university campuses, states\u2019 laws vary dramatically, but most allow institutions to limit open or concealed carry. Students across the country should ensure that their university has acted to limit guns to the extent the laws allow.\n\nAt athletic events, again laws vary. Generally, it is illegal to carry guns into professional athletic events from the NFL to the MLB.\n\nMost states also ban guns from high school or interscholastic sporting events. But as a college level, laws vary.\n\nIn many states, concealed carry is legal unless the university posts signs banning guns. Surely every campus should act to keep guns out of the stands at athletic events.\n\nIf more retailers follow Walmart, and if churches and universities and concert halls and movie theaters act to ban weapons from their premises, a movement for common sense gun regulation can continue to build.\n\nWhen Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called America the \u201cmost violent nation on earth,\u201d he was widely condemned, but he was right. No other nation suffers the level of gun violence that we endure. No other nation fights in as many wars on as many continents as we do.\n\nOther nations savaged by civil war or outside invasion may suffer greater casualties in a conflict, but we have made violence \u2014 and victims of violence \u2014 routine.\n\nKing argued that we have a choice in the end between nonviolence and nonexistence.\n\nThe only hope for sensible gun regulation is to challenge the corruption represented by the NRA by nonviolent demonstrations and action, enlisting the overwhelming majority of Americans in a movement for change.\n\nSend letters to: letters@suntimes.com.", "description": "Other nations savaged by civil war or outside invasion may suffer greater casualties in a conflict, but we have made violence \u2014 and victims of violence \u2014 routine.", "authors": ["Jesse Jackson", "Jon Seidel", "Cst Editorial Board", "Sun-Times Wire", "Khobi Price", "David Roeder", "Richard Roeper", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SsT6a0VZis7RrLkYPUFS3fJ390=/0x0:893x468/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19205341/0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
