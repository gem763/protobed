We\u2019ve had him marked as a player from the first time I saw him at St. George\u2019s [Park].\n\n\u201cChelsea would be the same on that, I think, but of course he\u2019s now been able to have the opportunity to play in the Premier League and display that against top teams.\n\n(Image: Eddie Keogh for The FA/REX)\n\n\"I think you saw his penalty in the Super Cup, [that] was a nice cameo of what he\u2019s about, really.\u201d\n\nSouthgate also admitted that Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban might be good news for England in the long term with the likes of Mount and Tammy Abraham now getting their chance.\n\nSouthgate added: \u201cI think I\u2019ve spoken for a couple of years now about the quality of young players coming through our academies.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Chelsea have been at the forefront of that, winning Champions League youth, FA Youth Cup consistently.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a shame maybe one or two of their youngsters didn\u2019t get that opportunity and have had to go and play elsewhere and might have missed that moment that has been perfect for the likes of Tammy and Mason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great timing for them because they\u2019ve had those loan spells and they were probably ready to take that opportunity.\n\n\"So, as a young player, you\u2019ve got ability, you\u2019ve got the work you do but in the end you need the opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe knew the quality of the players; maybe if they hadn\u2019t been in at Chelsea they might have gone on loan to a Premier League club this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good because if they\u2019re playing at a club like Chelsea, similar to Manchester City , the expectations are high and the pressure is high, so that\u2019s the environment that we need them to be playing in as much as possible.\n\n\u201cBut I think what\u2019s clear is that they\u2019re enjoying that opportunity and enjoying their football. They\u2019ve started the season reasonably well.\u201d", "description": "The Chelsea midfielder is set to be given his maiden start in Prague as England face the Czech Republic", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Eddie Keogh For The Fa Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20555875.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-Mens-Senior-Football-Team-Camp-St-Georges-Park-National-Football-Centre-Burton-upon-Tren.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
