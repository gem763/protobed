Now, it appears to be taking off.\n\nGo deeper: Sky-high hopes for drones tethered to safety concerns", "description": "Unmanned aerial vehicles have the potential to transform our daily lives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/_95fHke8GYCyRu21c2tmQP2MrTg=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/02/1570033543151.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
