Republican senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley have been vocal about weakening the power of Big Tech, while presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has called for the breakup of tech giants Amazon, Google (GOOGL), and Facebook, stating that she wants \u201cto make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish.\u201d\n\nWhile Buttigieg did not directly criticize Amazon, he did remark on how the company was able to pay $0 in taxes in 2018, despite bringing in $11.2 billion in profit.\n\n\u201cHow is it that Amazon paid less in federal income taxes than I did last year?\u201d he quipped.\n\n\u2018A whole bunch of work we\u2019ve got do\u2019\n\nButtigieg stressed that when dealing with tech, there\u2019s more to it than just \u201cthe monopoly piece,\u201d which is only part of it.\n\n\u201cA lot of it has to do with data security and data privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a national data privacy law. And this is going to be a problem for tech companies \u2026 whether you\u2019re a giant or a small firm, [for those who] can abuse it. We\u2019ve got to deal with that, in addition to the monopoly issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of work we\u2019ve got to do, just around the whole relationship with technology,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nAdriana is an associate editor for Yahoo Finance.
