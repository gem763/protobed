REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nThe French comment should unlock an agreement among the 27 EU countries staying on together after Brexit just three days before Britain would otherwise be due to leave.\n\nThe 27 national envoys to Brussels meet at 0900 GMT with diplomats and officials hoping that the decision would be smooth.\n\n\u201cThere will most likely be an agreement on Monday morning between the 27 on extension until January 31,\u201d the source said, adding that came after Macron spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson during the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe prospect of elections has strengthened significantly over the weekend,\u201d the source added, stressing the third postponement of Brexit would come with conditions. They include a refusal to renegotiate Johnson\u2019s divorce agreement and giving a green light to the 27 other EU countries to meet without Britain to discuss the bloc\u2019s future.\n\nJohnson\u2019s government on Sunday stepped up pressure on Britain\u2019s lawmakers to back early election to break the impasse on Brexit three years after Britons voted to leave the EU.\n\nA Downing Street source said the government would consider options including those proposed by opposition parties, after the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Liberal Democrats (LD) said they wanted a new poll on Dec.9.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping it will be smooth,\u201d an EU official said on Monday. \u201cSounds like the LD/SNP thing over the weekend gave them (the French) comfort an election was on its way.\u201d\n\nEU diplomats told Reuters on Sunday the third Brexit delay would come with earlier departure dates possible should Britain\u2019s parliament ratify the separation deal.\n\nThe plan envisages that Britain could also be out on Dec.1 or Jan.1 should parliament ratify the agreement in November or December, respectively, according to diplomats in Brussels.\n\nShould all the ambassadors agree, there will be a short period \u2014 less than 24 hours and possibly as little as several hours \u2014 during which national capitals could still object. If no issues are raised, the decision will have been taken.", "description": "The European Union will on Monday \"most likely\" agree to delay Britain's departure from the European Union until Jan.31, said a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron who last week prevented the bloc from reaching a decision on the delay.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445777875&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0E1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
