The year, month and date were on pieces of paper that were, literally, picked out of a hat. Weingarten admits the book idea is a stunt but professes his love for stunts that tell unexpected truths. Weingarten seeks to capture \u201cthe soul\u201d of the day through a series of stories about ordinary people who experienced a brush with fate that day. Think of it as a book of non-fiction short stories.\n\nWeingarten is an extraordinary reporter who mines vivid details from 33 years ago. Readers experience what people said, how they moved, what they thought. He claims to have conducted more than 500 interviews for this book, and it shows.\n\nThe two-time Pulitzer Prize winner for feature writing can turn a phrase, too. Football announcer John Madden \u201clooked as though he had sent his clothes to the rumplers.\u201d Incompetent spy Clayton Lonetree is described as \u201csomewhere between a schmendrick and a tool.\u201d\n\nIn one sense, this is book is like the proverbial box of chocolates. Some stories are better than others. The story of a murderer\u2019s heart being transplanted hours after his death is gripping and haunting. The tale of a girl who grew up to be a tell-all blogger is neither.\n\nBut the book adds up to something greater than the individual stories. People on that long-ago winter day experienced anger, pain, tension, happiness, doubt, satisfaction and hope. At his best, Weingarten taps into the wonder of what it is to be alive.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"One Day: The Extraordinary Story of an Ordinary 24 Hours in America,\" Blue Rider Press, by Gene Weingarten", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Hill"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/book_review_-_one_day_60750_c0-851-1838-1923_s1200x700.jpg?41517d1d71c98af0fb5efed7feac3ebf9dc9bc86", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
