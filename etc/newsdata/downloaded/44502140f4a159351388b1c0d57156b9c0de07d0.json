Indiana is up crying three times every night and then you\u2019ve got the school situation,\" Mrs Saunders said.\n\nShe said: \u201cUsually the sibling rule would mean Darcy could go to Christ Church, but we were told it doesn\u2019t apply because we\u2019re two or three streets away from the South Gloucestershire border.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s an accident close to Fishponds or Downend, the traffic is awful. We have been late three times in a week.\n\n\u201cWe leave about 8.15am and I\u2019m not back home until 9.45am most of the time.\n\n\u201cOne day Lexie had a dentist\u2019s appointment in Clifton. Phoenix had to walk over an hour and collect Memphis so I could take Lexie.\"\n\nMrs Saunders, who is on maternity leave, says her husband Rob is unable to help with the school run because of the hours of his job, working with tanks.\n\n\u201cWith doctor appointments, food shopping and work, it never seems to stop,\u201d she laughed.\n\nAsked if she would consider letting more of her children walk to school, she pointed to recent crime issues.\n\nShe said: \u201cI am always seeing things on Facebook saying to be on the lookout for this and that in the area.\n\n\u201cMy children are small and slight. Memphis looks seven, not 10. I want them all to be safe, and I don't think that's the case walking around here.\n\n\u201cOur house was owned by my nan. It\u2019s been in the family 70 years and we have made it our own.\n\n\u201cIt would be a shame to have to move just to get my children into the right schools.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for South Gloucestershire Council confirmed it did not offer Darcy a place at Christ Church.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a very popular school and at capacity in the class that the family hoped for him to join. We do recognise the frustration felt by Mrs Saunders.\n\n\u201cHowever, class sizes for Key Stage 1 are capped by law and while the sibling rule cannot apply as the family live outside the catchment area, in Bristol, that class is actually oversubscribed for local children as well.\n\n\u201cThe family did appeal our decision, but the appeals panel have very limited scope to review the decision, given the law on class sizes.\u201d\n\nThe panel found the council had correctly applied its admissions procedure.\n\nDarcy remains on a waiting list to join Christ Church, which has declined to comment.", "description": "Mum-of-five Hailey Saunders is forced to endure a nightmare 5.6-mile round journey twice a day in Gloucestershire", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Michael Lloyd Photography"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536585.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_ML_BRI191002schoolrun_122jpgd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
