Her father (the poet, Lord Byron), may not have wanted her to study maths and science but there was no stopping her brilliant mind,\" the brand states.\n\nIllustrator Rose Blake has drawn portraits of some of the women honoured in the Boden collection.\n\nTo take a closer look at Boden's new coat collection, click through the gallery above.\n\nTo find out more about the women who have provided inspiration for the range, click here.\n\nFor all the latest fashion news, click here.", "description": "Fashion label Boden has launched a new coat collection inspired by\u00a0celebrated, historical women from the arts.
