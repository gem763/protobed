This selling pressure drove QQQ down nearly 20% into the last week of December.\n\nThe rally over the past 10 months has QQQ working on a solid breakout above the 161% level at (1).\n\nIf QQQ succeeds in closing the month at the highest monthly closing price in history, it will send a positive message from this sector to the broad markets.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Chris Kimble covering: Invesco QQQ Trust.
