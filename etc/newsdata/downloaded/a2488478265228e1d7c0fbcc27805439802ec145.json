Democrat Daniel J. Hunt is driving a bill that would essentially make it illegal to call someone a \u201cbitch\u201d as part of his act \u201cregarding the use of offensive words.\u201d\n\nHunt \u2014 a Democrat \u2014 introduced a bill in May that would criminalize calling someone a \u201cbitch\u201d in an insulting manner.\n\nThe act states:\n\nA person who uses the word \u201cbitch\u201d directed at another person to accost, annoy, degrade or demean the other person shall be considered to be a disorderly person in violation of this section, and shall be subject to the penalties provided in subsections (a) and (b). A violation of this subsection may be reported by the person to whom the offensive language was directed at or by any witness to such incident.\n\nThe penalties include a $150 fine for the first violation and $200 plus possible jail time for any offenses that follow, according to the Boston Herald.\n\nHunt said he introduced the legislation, which is slated to go before the Joint Committee on the Judiciary on Tuesday, per a constituent\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cAny time a constituent approaches me with something that is of concern to them, I follow through with it,\u201d Hunt told the Boston Herald.\n\n\u201cIn this instance, someone asked me to file a bill that they deemed was important and I thought it was a good exercise to let that bill go through the process,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, critics, such as Cambridge civil-rights attorney Harvey Silverglate, say the bill would never hold up in court.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s challenged in court, it will take minutes for a judge to see through it,\u201d Silverglate said, according to the Herald.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a prayer of surviving, so why should the Legislature even burden us \u2014 the citizens, the press and the courts \u2014 why would they burden us with this nonsense? Surely they must have more important things to do,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThis is just the latest futile effort but the word police to control what other people say and indirectly control what they think,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBeacon Hill Democrats like @repdanhunt are fearlessly taking on the biggest problems facing the commonwealth,\u201d the Massachusetts GOP tweeted the day before the Judiciary Committee\u2019s Tuesday hearing:\n\nBeacon Hill Democrats like @repdanhunt are fearlessly taking on the biggest problems facing the commonwealth. #mapoli pic.twitter.com/xxyECXmd6J \u2014 MassGOP (@massgop) October 21, 2019\n\nDo you believe free speech matters? Tired of @massdems dictating what you can say? Judiciary Committee will be taking this up tomorrow at 1 pm. Come on down to the State House. Rooms A1&A2. First floor.
