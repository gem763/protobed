The red-top tabloid The Post, which Duncan edits, is a thinly veiled version of The Sun, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s brash, ethically untroubled daily paper that often claims to have so much power over its millions of readers that it can influence elections and referenda alike. The Herald, where Holly is the deputy news editor, is a fictional take on The Guardian, a left-of-center, straight news outlet that\u2019s perennially cash-strapped and bleeding readers. The Herald\u2019s employees see themselves as performing a public duty. The Post\u2019s think that the highest function of news is entertaining readers. \u201cThe Post is sexist, sensationalist, and doesn\u2019t check its facts,\u201d Holly tells Duncan primly in one of their earliest encounters. \u201cI know,\u201d he replies, unctuously. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more fun.\u201d\n\nThe old adage about fictional female reporters decrees that there can only be two types: the kind who get drunk a lot and sleep with people they shouldn\u2019t, and the kind who dress exclusively in shapeless knitwear and khakis. Holly, by some miracle of imagination, manages to be both. By day, she scours hospitals for sources and hectors a young acolyte (played by Game of Thrones\u2019s Ellie Kendrick) about the importance of old-school reporting; by night she drinks compulsively, grieves a lost friend, and takes home a youthful intern from the Post, Ed (Paapa Essiedu). Riley plays Holly with equal parts dourness and magnetism, qualities that should be physically impossible to combine. You love to watch her, even when all she\u2019s doing is squinting grimly at a laptop screen or frowning at people in meetings.\n\nWith Holly, and with The Herald, Press gets to pay homage to some of the best American journalism movies. (A Post reporter, after stealing a huge scoop from Herald writers, crows that he feels like he\u2019s in a scene from Spotlight.) There\u2019s a high-minded storyline about a foreign correspondent who\u2019s been fudging his reporting that mulls the kind of trust readers put in their media institutions. Holly reports out a colossal scandal about a high-profile billionaire who\u2019s been abusing his power over very young women. Herald writers research stories about clothing companies relying on child labor and a shadowy MI5 operation known only by a codename. Even a small story Holly uncovers about budget cuts at a local hospital turns into a riveting showdown between a journalist and an exhausted executive, both intent on claiming the moral high ground.\n\nIt\u2019s the scenes set at The Post, though, that best unpack the phenomenon of a certain kind of British journalism, where sex and scandal are paramount, ideally both at the same time. In the first episode, the rookie reporter Ed goes on his first \u201cdeath knock,\u201d doorstepping the family of a Premier League soccer star who\u2019s just died by suicide. Ed, who failed to win a spot on the Herald\u2019s trainee scheme, is clearly appalled by what he\u2019s tasked with doing\u2014informing grieving parents about their son\u2019s sexuality one day, secretly taping a children\u2019s TV presenter\u2019s rants at a party the next. Day by day though, as his scoops repeatedly lead the paper, Ed\u2019s integrity gets beaten down by the power of the front page.", "description": "Press is a fascinating, periodically clunky series about newspapers at war.", "authors": ["Sophie Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/MV5BNjA2NThhNjItMmE5Yi00Y2Y0LTgyOWUtMTQ1NGQwNDg0YzZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzOTM1NTc._V1_/facebook.jpg?1570554719", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
