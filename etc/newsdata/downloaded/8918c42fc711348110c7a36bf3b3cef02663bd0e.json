Consoles, phones, printers, whatever \u2014 I\u2019ve always needed to see what makes it all work. Sometimes they even work when I put them back together.\n\nAs soon as Google announced that the new Pixel 4 had friggin\u2019 radar built-in for detecting hand gestures, I needed to see under the hood. While I haven\u2019t picked up a Pixel 4 yet, our friends over at iFixit busted out the heat guns and did what they do best, tearing the Pixel 4 XL down to parts and uncovering the Project Soli radar chip along the way.\n\nImage Source: iFixit\n\nThat board you\u2019re looking at contains a good amount of stuff beyond the Soli chip \u2014 it\u2019s also where you\u2019ll find the earpiece speaker and the ambient light sensor, for example. The Soli chip seems to be that little greenish box in the upper-right area.\n\nAlas, there\u2019s\u2026 not a ton to learn just from looking at it. Google has spent the last few years working on this, and they\u2019ve ended up with something that\u2019s honestly a bit wild. With no moving parts, and without line of sight, these chips are able to do things like detect when people are near the device (and how many), whether they\u2019re standing or sitting, how they\u2019re moving their hands and more. As iFixit so succinctly puts it, \u201cTL;DR: magic rectangle knows your every move.\u201d\n\nFor anyone looking to tear apart the Pixel 4 XL themselves, be it to make repairs or just out of curiosity, make sure you know what you\u2019re getting into. iFixit gives the device a relatively paltry 4 out of 10 on its repairability score, citing easily breakable pull tabs and particularly strong adhesives as obstacles along the way. You can find their full teardown here.\n\nImage Source: iFixit", "description": "I\u2019ve been tearing my gadgets apart for as long as I can remember.
