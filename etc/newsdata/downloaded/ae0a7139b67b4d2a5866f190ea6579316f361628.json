They responded to the fact check with a letter demanding a retraction:\n\nNEWS: The Bernie 2020 campaign has just sent a detailed letter to @washingtonpost editor @PostBaron demanding a retraction of the inaccurate \"fact check\" article about @BernieSanders & medical bankruptcy.

Other left-wing journos and media outlets are slamming WaPo for failing to indulge Sanders\u2019 claims:\n\nGetting the facts wrong once is a mistake. Getting them wrong consistently when it concerns one candidate is suggestive of bias. The Bezos-owned Washington Post is consistently sloppy and negative in its coverage of Bernie Sanders. One might even call it \"political.\" https://t.co/PJyDia2lYM \u2014 Walker Bragman (@WalkerBragman) August 29, 2019\n\nWhy is the Washington Post fact checker calling accurate things \"mostly false\"?https://t.co/8KtBb4EbIL \u2014 Tim Dickinson (@7im) August 29, 2019\n\nThe Washington Post's war on Bernie Sanders is dishonest and embarrassing. https://t.co/bbSsVKv4Ow \u2014 Jacobin (@jacobinmag) September 3, 2019\n\nFact checking is a sacred art, and when it comes to Bernie Sanders, The Washington Post needs to reevaluate its methods. https://t.co/hUCYnVWWgL \u2014 The Nation (@thenation) September 3, 2019\n\nSince these outlets don\u2019t seem to be interested in much beyond protecting the precious, WaPo columnist Megan McArdle is graciously doing their work for them and taking a closer look at why Sanders\u2019 claim merited those three Pinocchios.\n\nMegan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) deconstructs the claim that medical bills cause more than half of all bankruptcies: https://t.co/KJhdmFx4Ol \u2014 Michael F. Cannon (@mfcannon) September 3, 2019\n\nCheck it out:\n\nSince everyone is @'ing me on the dispute between the Bernie campaign and our Fact Checker on medical bankruptcy, I will make a few brief notes. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nFirst, the researchers whom Sanders is relying are the cofounders of Physicians for a National Health Program, an organization which long predates (https://t.co/3PxjqPNrTK) their interest in bankruptcy, medical or otherwise. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nThey're activists. There's nothing wrong with being activists. But they are not disinterested researchers, and you shouldn't treat their work as if they were. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nSecond, their work appears to be purpose-built to deliver the result that all bankruptcies are caused by medical events. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nThird, Woolhandler and Himmelstein have not been as strenuous as they might in correcting the incredibly common misreading of their work, in which careless readers transmogrify \"illness related\" into \"caused by medical bills\". \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nThose are not the same thing. Canada has medical bankruptcy, despite \"medicare for all\", because if you get sick and can't work, and you have a lot of debt, things go south pretty quick. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nWhich is how we get to the statistic\u2013falsified *even by the studies that allegedly support it*\u2013that more than half of all bankruptcies are caused by medical bills. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nNote that these studies do not say that the bankruptcies are caused by medical bills; their design can't possibly establish causation. But somehow people get that impression! Multiple times! And no one really corrects it! It is a puzzle! \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nA couple more notes: first, the studies they did showed that having insurance did very little to protect you from a medical bankruptcy (under their definition of a medical bankruptcy). \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nThey say that shows that American health insurance is garbage. I say that shows their data is garbage. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nThere is a non-trivial difference between having a high deductible and being on the hook for the entire cost of your quadruple bypass. If your study doesn't detect one, you did something wrong. Whatever you're studying, it isn't \"medical bankruptcy\". \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nOr at least, you're not studying medical bankruptcy, caused by *medical bills*, which is the only problem that their national health program can solve. No health insurance program in the world fixes the problems of a self-employed plumber with a $500k house and multiple sclerosis \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nTo believe that all of the \"medical bankruptcies\" they found are caused by medical bills\u2013in the sense of \"none of these people would have declared bankruptcy except for having high medical bills\"\u2013you have to believe that income loss is irrelevant. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nBut also you have to believe that in the entire united states, only about 250k people declare bankruptcy for every other reason: job loss, divorce, small business failure, predatory lending, fraud, etc. Does that seem \u2026 likely? \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nKeeping in mind that the majority of the very-high-cost patients are \u2026 already on Medicare? Because they're old? \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nThat stat should never have passed the sniff test. It's crazy. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nThis is not to say that medical bills never cause bankruptcies, or that that isn't a problem worth addressing. But 500k is way too high for that number. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nNot least because bankruptcy is almost always multi-factorial. It's people who had a lot of debt and *then* got divorced, or sick, or fired, or sued. If they hadn't piled on the payments, they wouldn't be bankrupt, and also, if they hadn't been unlucky, they wouldn't be bankrupt. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nThere's this endless debate in bankruptcy that boils down to \"unlucky or unwise?\" and the answer is \"Embrace the healing power of 'and' \". \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nI\u2019m not sure how any of this is a fact check? Bankruptcy that medical costs contributed to affect over 500,000 people a year. Your paper has published the same thing. You\u2019re not disagreeing with that here either. \u2014 100% Unbiased (like everyone else) (@SciencePartisan) September 3, 2019\n\nI am, in fact, disagreeing with it. Consider a case I covered in which a woman who has a clear compulsive spending problem BK'd five-figure debts to her cosmetic dermatologist, along with a mountain of housing/school/car debt. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nThe cosmetic dermatologist did not, in any way, cause the BK; her husband wrote a book on their financial problems, which trace to a) expensive divorces and b) buying too much house. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nBut it would show up in Himmelstein et al as a medical bankruptcy, even though it wasn't, and used to argue for single-payer, even though no single-payer system in the world covers cosmetic dermatology. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nTheir method has no way to distinguish those cases. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nI'm not disputing that Woolhandler and Himmelstein make these claims. They do! I am saying they have very poor evidence for their claims. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nwas their research peer-reviewed and published by AJPH? if so, you need to demonstrate that *they* are activists to undercut the findings. \u2014 \ud83d\udd25we need a movement\ud83c\udf49 (@youlickboots) September 3, 2019\n\n\"peer review\" is not some magic incantation that makes arguments correct. At best, it can weed out the most glaring methodological errors. It doesn't even always do that. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nChanting \"peer review\" will not make these arguments correct. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nLook at it this way: if medical bankruptcies are so obviously the majority of the problem, why did Obamacare cause *no* noticeable inflection in the bankruptcy rate? pic.twitter.com/unWyntpWcz \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nYou want to argue that Obamacare is inadequate, fine\u2013but if it really caused zero apparent decline in the rate of bankruptcies, then it should give you pause that we spent a trillion dollars and did *nothing* to make American families more financially secure. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 3, 2019\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth:", "description": "megan mcardle", "authors": ["Sarah D", "Posted At Pm On September", "Sarah D."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bernie.jpg"}
