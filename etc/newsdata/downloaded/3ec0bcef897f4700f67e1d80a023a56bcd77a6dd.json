Media outlets disagree.\n\nIn 2010, for example, the FBI rounded up 10 Russian sleeper agents, including a couple whose children had no idea what they were up to. In 2016, Christopher Steele, whose dossier on Trump was privately commissioned, relied on intelligence from his sources in Moscow.\n\nTurning informants against their own governments can have powerful results, experts say. They have insight that an algorithm may not be able to match and a sense of where the best available information might be \u2014 as opposed to the indiscriminate vacuum cleaner approach of a digital intelligence operation.\n\n\u201cEspionage is as old as governments and societies itself,\u201d said Calder Walton, a historian who studies intelligence-gathering and is assistant director of the Applied History Project at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cA good spy in the right place and the right time can give you intelligence no other source can.\u201d\n\nAs news spread of the 2017 CIA exfiltration \u2014 first reported by CNN \u2014 the Russian media cast suspicion on Oleg Smolenkov, a former diplomat who more recently worked in the administration of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis mid-level bureaucrat disappeared with his wife and three children while on vacation in Montenegro. Russia at first opened a murder investigation, but dropped it when information came to light that the family was alive and living in Virginia \u2014 under their own names.\n\nSo, for quite some time, the Russians have known that this former Kremlin insider was living in the United States, and there has been no fuss up to now.\n\n\u201cHe was fired a couple of years ago and this is the only thing I can tell you now,\u201d Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cHe was never a high-ranking official.\u201d\n\nU.S. got key asset out of Russia following election hacking\n\nSome Russian commentators have suggested that the identification of this bureaucrat by the Kommersant newspaper, quickly followed by other news sites, has more to do with Kremlin infighting than anything else.\n\nSmolenkov had worked as a diplomat in Washington for the then-Russian ambassador, Yuri Ushakov, then worked for him as an aide when Ushakov joined the Russian cabinet. From there, he went with Ushakov to the Kremlin, where Ushakov today is a foreign policy adviser to Putin.\n\n\u201cOf course Ushakov is a target,\u201d said Chervonnaya, the former U.S. and Canada analyst in Moscow. \u201cBut why after so many years? It looks a little bit crazy.\u201d\n\nHow, she asked, could a top adviser to a top adviser disappear and hardly make any waves?\n\n\u201cSomething is missing in this story,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than two years.\u201d\n\nThat, too, might have something to do with the Kremlin in its current incarnation under Putin, suggested Andrei Soldatov, who has made a career studying Russia\u2019s secret services.\n\nIt may not be \u201cunthinkable\u201d that someone could vanish from the halls of power unremarked \u2014 even if he was in a position to gather critical intelligence, as the Americans have described their agent.\n\n\u201cThe Kremlin bureaucracy became so secretive that unthinkable could be possible,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAlexei Venediktov, editor in chief at the Ekho Moskvy radio station, asked on the air why the suspected agent would buy a house in the United States under his own name if he were such a high-ranking spy.\n\n\u201cDo you think,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all idiots here?\u201d\n\nAnd yet that\u2019s exactly what Shevchenko did, after he emerged from six months in hiding after his defection in 1978.\n\nHe had snuck out of his New York apartment while his wife was asleep, he later acknowledged, but left her a note telling her how she could join him. He had feared she would alert the KGB if she knew of his plan or learned of his espionage.\n\nShe did call the KGB when she woke up in the morning. They took her back to Moscow where she died less than two months later, officially a victim of suicide.\n\nShevchenko bought a house in Georgetown with money provided by the U.S. government. The FBI, he later said, fixed him up with dates from an escort service.\n\nIn 1985, he went on \u201cThe Phil Donahue Show,\u201d where he said that even though the KGB knew where to find him, he didn\u2019t expect an immediate assassination attempt. It wouldn\u2019t be good, he said, for the Soviet image to kill the former No. 2 diplomat at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that eventually they will not get me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that the KGB has a long hand and a long memory.\u201d\n\nAnd its successor agencies apparently still do. Russia\u2019s state intelligence agencies are considered prime suspects in the gruesome murder by radiation poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 and the attempted killing with a nerve agent of Sergei Skripal last year \u2014 both men reviled in the Russian services as turncoats.\n\nShevchenko had said it took him \u201cyears and years\u201d to decide to defect. He approached the CIA in 1975, but they asked him to stay on at the United Nations and pass on intelligence about Soviet policies. He hadn\u2019t expected that \u2014 but agreed.\n\nIn 1978, he got a message recalling him to Moscow. He went to Washington instead.\n\nThe KGB never did get him. He died in Washington in 1998, of cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nHow Gina Haspel manages the CIA\u2019s volatile relationship with Trump\n\nOpinion: The saga of the Chinese mole that reads like a spy thriller\n\nOpinion: What\u2019s it like to live in a surveillance state?
