But Beijing is trying to temper expectations, while companies express frustration over the halting pace of market-opening.\n\nThe China Daily, an English-language newspaper aimed at foreign readers, warned Tuesday the two sides have yet to put last week\u2019s agreement on paper after President Donald Trump suspended a planned tariff hike. In exchange, Trump said Beijing would buy up to $50 billion of American farm goods, a pledge China has yet to confirm.\n\n\u201cThere is always the possibility that Washington may decide to cancel the deal if it thinks that doing so will better serve its interests,\u201d said the newspaper. It called on the Trump administration to \u201cavoid backpedaling.\u201d\n\nBusiness groups welcomed the truce as a possible step toward ending the costly, 15-month-old fight but said it was a small one. Talks broke down earlier after Trump accused Beijing of backsliding on promises Washington believed were locked in.\n\nOn Tuesday, a foreign ministry spokesman said Chinese importers have bought 20 million tons of soybeans and 700,000 tons of pork this year from the United States. He gave no details on when that happened.\n\nChina\u2019s imports of U.S. soybeans fell by about half last year to 16.6 million tons from 2017\u2019s 33 million tons.\n\n\u201cChina will further speed up procurement of U.S. agricultural products,\u201d said the spokesman, Geng Shuang.\n\nFriday\u2019s agreement coincided with China\u2019s announcement of a timetable to carry out a 2017 promise to abolish limits on foreign ownership of some finance businesses, starting with futures trading firms on Jan. 1. Securities firms and mutual fund managers follow later in the year.\n\nInvestors saw that as a commitment to freer trade. Chinese officials say it has nothing to do with the trade talks and isn\u2019t a concession to Washington.\n\nOver the past 18 months, President Xi Jinping\u2019s government also has promised to allow full foreign ownership in banking, insurance and auto manufacturing in hopes of making its slowing economy more competitive and productive.\n\nNone addresses U.S. complaints that plans for government-led creation of Chinese competitors in robotics and other industries violate Beijing\u2019s market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology.\n\nChinese market-opening initiatives follow a standard script. Authorities announce dramatic but vague promises that raise hopes abroad. Six months to a year passes while companies wait to see regulations. Many are dismayed when they impose costly licensing requirements or curbs on the size of a business.\n\nForeign companies are frustrated Beijing is moving so gradually 17 years after joining the free-trading World Trade Organization. China, the biggest global exporter, is widely seen as having benefited most from freer trade but faces complaints it violates the rules and spirit of the WTO by blocking access to its own markets and subsidizing Chinese competitors.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s opening-up process needs to move beyond piecemeal changes and instead embrace an absolute approach in which China goes from \u2018increasingly open\u2019 to \u2018open\u2019,\u201d said Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\nChinese leaders want foreign capital, skills and competition for an economy where huge but inefficient state companies still control industries including oil and gas, telecoms, banking, insurance and power generation.\n\nBeijing wants more foreign involvement to help improve China\u2019s finance industry, said Lester Ross, a lawyer in Beijing for the firm WilmerHale.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of attractiveness\u201d for foreign banks, insurers and other competitors in China\u2019s fledgling market, he said.\n\nOpening its own markets also gives Beijing leverage to ask the United States and other governments to let wholly Chinese-owned banks, insurance and other companies into their markets, Ross said.\n\nBeijing allowed full foreign ownership of electric car producers starting last year. Restrictions on commercial vehicle manufacturing end next year and for passenger vehicles in 2022.\n\nThat reflects confidence Chinese electric car brands including BYD Auto and BAIC, which are among the global industry\u2019s biggest producers by vehicles sold, can compete with foreign rivals.\n\nGlobal automakers that until now were required to work through state-owned partners are so deeply enmeshed in those ventures that most plan to stick with them. Buying out partners could cost billions of dollars and the foreigners would lose their political connections.\n\n\u201cChina is accelerating the pace of opening, but we still need to see those implementing regulations in place and how fast those are carried out,\u201d said Ross.\n\nForeign banks are applying to set up shop in China following an August 2018 pledge to allow full foreign ownership. But they need an eye-wateringly high minimum capital of 40 billion yuan ($5.7 billion) to operate in China or 8 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) to conduct cross-border services.\n\nThat is beyond the reach of all but the richest foreign institutions.\n\nA handful of American, European and Japanese banks have been given approval to set up Chinese ventures. It is unclear whether they met the capital requirement or whether regulators eased that as a concession to Washington and other trading partners.\n\nIn insurance, foreign investors face a time-consuming licensing process that requires them to apply in one of China\u2019s 36 provinces and major cities at a time and wait up to a year for approvals. Obtaining approval for the biggest provinces could take up to a decade.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s efforts to boost investor confidence face significant headwinds,\u201d said Andrew Coflan and Allison Sherlock of Eurasia Group in a report.\n\nAnother hurdle: government controls on the movement of money into and out of China. That adds to the cost and difficulty of bringing in capital and taking home profits.\n\nSuch obstacles \u201cmake entrance by foreign financial firms a challenge, even with no ownership caps,\u201d said Coflan and Sherlock.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Chinese post office said fees it pays the United States and other countries to deliver packages will nearly triple through 2025 under an agreement following complaints by Washington.\n\nPayments will rise 27% next year and by 164% in total through 2025 under the Sept. 25 agreement by members of the Universal Postal Union, the State Postal Bureau said in a statement.\n\nThe Trump administration complained the U.S. Post Office was subsidizing Chinese exporters, which it said pay too little to deliver the vast flow of packages generated by online commerce.", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 A truce in a U.S.-Chinese tariff war and Beijing's promises to open more of its state-dominated economy are raising investor hopes.
