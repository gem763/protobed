Its photo depicted an anonymous black-clad woman on an airport tarmac, crying over a metal casket covered in an American flag. \u201cKillary Clinton will never understand what it feels like to lose the person you love for the sake of your country,\u201d the caption began. \u201cHonoring the high cost paid by so many families to protect our freedom. Buy a T-shirt\u2014help a veteran.\u201d\n\nIn the world of military memes, it was a pretty standard sponsored post by the popular american.veterans Instagram account, targeted at members of online groups for the United States Army Reserve, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Concerned Veterans for America, and a fan page for Chris Kyle of American Sniper fame. The apparel sales were real, but the post was not concocted by a veteran\u2014not a United States veteran, at least. The account that posted it was controlled by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency; for just over 3,000 rubles (about $50), its \u201cKillary\u201d post was targeted to nearly 18,000 mostly-veteran Instagram users; at least 500 clicked through to the third-party site selling \u201cMilVet\u201d apparel. \u201cWho profits from sales of MilVet merchandise in any of these cases is also unknown,\u201d investigators now say, though it\u2019s not hard to imagine who profited from the post\u2019s political message.\n\nIt was but one of thousands of politically charged social media posts directed at military veterans by foreign actors, according to a new 191-page investigative report released Tuesday by Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA). And rather than taper off after the 2016 election, these shady accounts and shareable memes have continued to proliferate. \u201cKnown Russian propaganda and similar politically divisive content that targets service members and veterans is being spread by admins from at least 30 foreign countries, with concentrations in Eastern Europe and Vietnam,\u201d VVA chief investigator Kristopher Goldsmith, writes in the report\u2019s executive summary.\n\nThat report, which builds on inquiries begun by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, also details how an online account claiming to be a wing of ISIS called the \u201cCyber Caliphate\u201d was, instead, a Russian cutout. Under the guise of Islamist terror, the Russian account sent a string of threatening messages to military wives: \u201cWe know everything about you, your husband and your children and we\u2019re much closer than you can even imagine.\u201d Mission accomplished: The messages prompted a cycle of alarmist national news coverage. \u201cOnline Threat to Army Wife: ISIS Is Coming For You,\u201d the Fox News Insider headline blazed, incorrectly.", "description": "Building on congressional intelligence, a new report offers a broad view on the dirty tricks trolls use to hook American servicemembers.", "authors": ["Jasper Craven"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/c4d7a05e1b2c46ca2bc314683e238f806853674e.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
