The president\u2019s rally in Minneapolis was dotted with left-wing thugs who harassed and assaulted Trump supporters because having a view that isn\u2019t to the left of Lenin is intolerable to these clowns. We\u2019re all Nazis in the eyes of these people. They\u2019ve become totally unhinged by the 2016 election and this incident last night toward one Trump supporter, who was being interviewed by Vice News, perfectly captures how extreme liberals have become: he was spat on.\n\nThe supporter, Dave Carlson, wasn\u2019t angry. He took it in stride. The host was visibly shocked by the action. Another man is seen apologizing for the incident. Another individual, while not a supporter of the president, also came up to Carlson to say what happened to him was not appropriate, but added that his MAGA hat was also \u201cdisrespectful as f**k.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Protester spits on Trump supporter during interview at Minneapolis rally https://t.co/WIN6yJDsqf pic.twitter.com/sXIpvDZbRn \u2014 VICE News (@vicenews) October 11, 2019\n\nTHIS???? RIGHT ????HERE ????\n\n\n\nThis is the perfect contrast between political left & right.\n\n\n\nAn leftist coward spit in this man\u2019s face because of politics.\n\n\n\nThe man doesn\u2019t retaliate, get mad or become a victim.\n\nHe wipes his brow & keeps defending our President.\n\npic.twitter.com/m7KAzzSeWz \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 11, 2019\n\nI literally gasped when I watched this. What a disgusting human being.\n\n\n\nThe class of this Trump supporter in response to being SPIT ON by a radical leftist is just ?????? https://t.co/0THJJUFGYG \u2014 Andrew Clark?? (@AndrewHClark) October 11, 2019\n\nCortney was at the rally and got some excellent content from the event. Yet, things got out of hand in the end. We all remember what happened when Trump tried to hold a rally in Chicago. We should expect more unhinged liberals assaulting and attacking those with whom they disagree because that\u2019s the Left in 2020. You will fall in line. And people look at me sideways when I tell them I\u2019m a Republican. This right here is why. We don\u2019t spit on people. We win elections. And I have a feeling 2020 is going to usher in another four years of Trump. And yes, spitting on someone's face is a crime for all you triggered losers who are just horrified that everyone is not a total communist.\n\nHats off to the Minny police officers last night, who were out protecting protesters even though some were waving around signs reading, \u201cBlue Lives Don\u2019t F***ing Matter.\u201d #Minneapolis #MinneapolisTrumpRally pic.twitter.com/GlBJ1e5hBQ \u2014 Cortney O'Brien (@obrienc2) October 11, 2019", "description": ".10/11/2019 20:17:23PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/284/6be3435d-996e-412b-a4d9-523f9f2619e2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
