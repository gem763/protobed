The Joker was featured in 2012's The Dark Knight Rises which was playing in a theater in Aurora, Colorado in July 2012 that was the site of a mass shooting.\n\nWith a win at the 76th annual Venice Film Festival last month and critical acclaim that has earned it a near-perfect Internet Movie Database score of 9.4 out of 10, \u201cJoker\u201d has been building up hype for weeks. The crime thriller\u2019s R-rating and star-studded casting that includes the like of Robert De Niro and Zazie Beets certainly haven\u2019t hurt either.\n\nThe solo feature film of Batman\u2019s greatest villain is described as a gritty character study of how the Joker came to be. This attempt at subversive storytelling has paid off for AT&T owned Warner Bros with \u201cJoker\u201d presale tickets outpacing the amount sold for Sony\u2019s anti-hero \u201cVenom\u201d film of last year on Atom Tickets, an online movie ticket retailer. In fact, Atom Tickets reported that \u201cJoker\u201d is the company\u2019s second-highest pre-sale after \u201cJohn Wick Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d is poised to have an $80 million-plus opening. The movie is expected to open in at least 4,000-plus theaters.\n\n\u201cJoker,\u201d which is highly inspired by Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe King of Comedy,\u201d according to a confirmation De Niro gave to Indie Wire \u2014 follows the life of Arthur Fleck and delves into mental health.\n\nIn the April teaser trailer, the Joker's alter ego Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is seen writing in a notebook the following line: \u201cThe worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't.\u201d\n\nAs chaos ensues later in the two-minute and 24-second video, that Fleck narrates, \u201cFor my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do, and people are starting to notice.\u201d\n\nThese poignant lines have made people question whether Warner Bros is unintentionally glorifying violence.\n\nAn entertainment op-ed in the New York Post asked, \u201cGiven our era of unrelenting mass shootings and \u201cincel\u201d becoming a household term, it\u2019s sadly fair to ask: Will the Joker become a potential inspiration for would-be killers?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nResidents of Aurora, Colorado who were greatly impacted by the 2012 active shooting at a midnight screening of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d were moved enough to pen a letter to the media company in late September about safety and social responsibility.\n\nAmid public questioning and concern, Warner Bros released an official statement on Sept. 24 that said: \u201cMake no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind.\u201d\n\nIn terms of global box office projections, \u201cJoker\u201d is currently set to make a $155 million open, according to a report from Deadline.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Warner Bros villainy \"Joker\" is posed to have a multi-million dollar opening weekend.
