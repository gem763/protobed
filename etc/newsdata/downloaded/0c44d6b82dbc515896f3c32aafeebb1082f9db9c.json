I think she'll spend the money wisely and she's such a lovely person, she is a loon - very funny.\n\n\"My nephews and nieces all live abroad and are doing very well. I have no children and there is no one else I would like to leave the money to.\"\n\n(Image: Steve Bell)\n\nFearing he may not have long left due to debilitating diabetes and an MRSA infection, Thomas wants to get the money to 'Laura' - who he believes to be 41 - as soon as possible.\n\nAccording to Thomas, who has had his lower right leg amputated, 'Laura' used to wear her hair in pigtails and had links to Pumpkin Film Production.\n\nThe company was formerly based on Ebenezer Street, to the east of Bristol.\n\nHe says the model could have left the city by now and her former profession - but he's hoping her family could still live in the area.\n\n(Image: Steve Bell)\n\nUnfortunately, although Thomas' intentions for his assets are clear, he will not be able to leave his money to 'Laura' unless she can be properly identified.\n\nGraham Southorn, a legacy planner for Maplebrook Wills, said: \"For someone to receive inheritance as much information as is required to identify the beneficiary.\n\n\"The executors of a will have to be able to find the intended beneficiary - they can be held personally liable if a claim is made. So they need enough information to do that.\"", "description": "Besotted Thomas Weir is keen to stress he is not a stalker and simply wants to give her the money as she \"is lovely\"", "authors": ["Emma Flanagan", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Steve Bell"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20665457.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_sb_babetv_002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
