On the heels of a controversial ending, Thrones took home the prize it most needed to win to cement its place in television history: Best Drama. But, one week after the series picked up 10 Creative Arts Emmys, it only won one other major award at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards \u2014 Best Supporting Actor in a Drama for Peter Dinklage \u2014 and the night never quite evolved into the victory lap that many fans were expecting.\n\nIt\u2019s a fitting end to a complicated season. Game of Thrones\u2018 eighth season, which left behind George R. R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire books entirely, was so controversial that some fans started a petition asking HBO to remake the ending. Emilia Clarke expressed at least minor misgivings about her character Daenerys\u2019 arc. Creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss essentially went into hiding after the finale until the fan response blew over. And yet, clearly even the hate-watchers kept watching, propelling the series to record ratings.\n\nLeading into the Emmys, prognosticators seemed to think the show would either sweep the many categories in which it was nominated and mark the end of the television monoculture or tip-toe away with a couple of smaller wins.\n\nBut Emmy voters defied expectations. They opted to dole out a single acting award to the most decorated actor in the show\u2019s cast. On Sunday night, Dinklage set a record for most wins in his category with a fourth trophy. Meanwhile, eight of Dinklage\u2019s cast members, including Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke, walked away empty-handed, and the writers and directors failed to take home any awards for their work on the series.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Comer was so shocked by the victory she joked in her speech that she hadn\u2019t even invited her parents to the ceremony because she didn\u2019t think this would be her year. (They were watching from home in Liverpool.)\n\nUp-and-coming Ozark actor Julia Garner beat four different Game of Thrones stars (Gwendoline Christie, Lena Headey, Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner) in the Best Supporting Actress in a Drama category. And Pose\u2019s Billie Porter made history as the first openly gay black actor to win in the Best Actor in a Drama category, beating out Thrones\u2019 Kit Harington.\n\nThe biggest upset came when Ozark star Jason Bateman single-handedly beat four Game of Thrones directors to win the Best Directing category. Directing seemed like an easy win for Thrones. Yes, you had to turn up the brightness on your screen to really see the Battle of Winterfell. And, yes, there was the coffee cup incident.\n\nBut David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (who co-directed one episode), David Nutter and Miguel Sapochnik helmed the biggest and most complicated battle scenes and fights ever to grace the small screen. Sapochnik\u2019s take on the Battle of Winterfell \u2014 which has often been compared to the Oscar-worthy Battle of Helms\u2019 Deep in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers \u2014 felt like nothing if not awards bait.\n\nAnd yet Bateman beat them all. The actor-turned-director sat in his seat staring in disbelief when he realized he had just beaten out the people responsible for one-half of Game of Thrones\u2018 final season.\n\nDon\u2019t mourn too long for Daenerys Targeryen and Jon Snow, though. They\u2019re not exactly slinking out of pop-culture prominence.\n\nGame of Thrones still holds the record for most Emmys ever won by a television drama or comedy with 59 wins. And with its fourth and final Best Drama win, Thrones ties the category\u2019s record holders \u2014 Mad Men, Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law and The West Wing, an impressive group.\n\nWe can\u2019t know yet how exactly Thrones will be remembered, especially with several prequel series on the way. But it was the first fantasy series to really attract and sustain the attention of Emmys voters. Before Thrones, the genre was long ignored, considered unserious. In the coming years, new fantasy and sci-fi series will vie for its spot at the awards show, including HBO\u2019s own His Dark Materials adaptation, Amazon\u2019s Lord of the Rings series and Disney\u2019s Star Wars spinoff, The Mandalorian.\n\nGame of Thrones\u2018 legacy will be complicated. But it certainly changed what we consider \u201cgood TV\u201d forever.\n\nWrite to Eliana Dockterman at eliana.dockterman@time.com.", "description": "The show won the big one, but missed out on many other awards, cementing its complicated legacy.", "authors": ["Eliana Dockterman"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/game-of-thrones-s8-e6-tyrion.jpeg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
