A Justice Department spokeswoman said it was reviewing the decision. The administration can appeal.\n\nThe ruling in favor of the House Judiciary Committee comes as Democrats gather closed-door testimony from current and former government officials about the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden. The Mueller materials could reveal previously hidden details to lawmakers about Trump\u2019s actions during the 2016 election and become part of the impeachment push.\n\nThe material covered by Howell\u2019s order consists of redacted grand jury testimony mentioned in Mueller\u2019s report. The Justice Department says that information is the only piece of the document that key lawmakers have not had access to.\n\nDemocrats believe the still-redacted information could shed new light on key episodes of the investigation, including discussions Trump is reported to have had with associates about the release of stolen emails during the campaign and conversations about a 2016 Trump Tower meeting at which Trump\u2019s eldest son expected to receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The judge said the materials could help lawmakers as they decide which witnesses to call for an impeachment inquiry and what additional lines of investigation should be pursued.\n\nIn a 75-page ruling accompanying the order, Howell slashed through many of the administration\u2019s arguments for withholding materials from Congress, including the need for continued secrecy.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that DOJ and the White House have been openly stonewalling the House\u2019s efforts to get information by subpoena and by agreement, and the White House has flatly stated that the Administration will not cooperate with congressional requests for information,\u201d Howell wrote.\n\nWhile the Justice Department said it could not provide grand jury material under existing law, \u201cDOJ is wrong,\u201d she wrote. And though the White House and its Republican allies argued impeachment is illegitimate without a formal vote, the judge said: \u201cA House resolution has never, in fact, been required.\u201d\n\nThe judge also rejected the Justice Department\u2019s argument that impeachment does not qualify as a \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d That distinction matters because, though grand jury testimony is ordinarily secret, one exemption that allows it to be legally disclosed is in connection with a judicial proceeding.\n\n\u201cTo the extent the House\u2019s role in the impeachment context is to investigate misconduct by the President and ascertain whether that conduct amounts to an impeachable offense warranting removal from office, the House performs a function somewhat akin to a grand jury,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he was pleased by the ruling.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s thoughtful ruling recognizes that our impeachment inquiry fully comports with the Constitution and thoroughly rejects the spurious White House claims to the contrary,\u201d Nadler said in a statement. \u201cThis grand jury information that the Administration has tried to block the House from seeing will be critical to our work.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the ruling was \u201canother blow to President Trump\u2019s attempt to put himself above the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis critical court ruling affirms Congress\u2019s authority to expose the truth for the American people. Most importantly, the Court recognized the House\u2019s right to obtain grand jury information pursuant to its impeachment inquiry,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nJustice Department lawyers argued against providing the materials at a hearing earlier this month. They pointed out that House Democrats already had significant evidence from Mueller\u2019s investigation, including copies of summaries of FBI witness interviews. But the judge said that information is no substitute for the actual grand jury testimony.\n\n\u201cTo insure most effectively against being misled, HJC must have access to all essential pieces of testimony by witnesses, including testimony given under oath to the grand jury,\u201d Howell said, referring to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, for purposes of assessing and following up on the Mueller Report\u2019s conclusions, the full Report is needed: the grand jury material may offer unique insights, insights not contained in the rest of the Report, congressional testimony\u201d or FBI reports, she added.\n\nThe Mueller report found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign. It also examined multiple episodes in which Trump sought to thwart the investigation and pointedly determined that he could not be exonerated on obstruction of justice allegations.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A judge has ordered the Justice Department to give the House secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/25/e77de3_trump-46034-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-speaks-2019-step-presidential-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
