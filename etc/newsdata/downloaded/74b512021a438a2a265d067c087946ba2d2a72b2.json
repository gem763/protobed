They had no outside contact, having left their mobile phones at the South Korean Embassy in Beijing before entering the North.\n\nChoi said North Korean officials didn't inform the South Korean team the match would be played in an empty stadium.\n\n\"We got there an hour and a half early and kept thinking that the gate will open and a crowd of 50,000 would pour in,\" Choi said. \"But the gate never opened until the end.\"\n\nThe game was the first competitive meeting between the national men's teams in the North Korean capital, although the North hosted the South in a friendly in 1990.", "description": "The 'rough' World Cup qualifier was played behind closed doors and under a media blackout.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/513a8668938041ab87aa4270d8fb5212_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
