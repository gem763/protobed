He is a former federal prosecutor and host of the \u201cOn Topic\u201d podcast.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much damage the testimony of Ukraine envoy William Taylor inflicted on President Donald Trump\u2019s defense in the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn its face, Taylor\u2019s testimony Tuesday established the quid pro quo that Trump has denied for weeks. But more importantly, Taylor\u2019s detailed notes of the \u201chighly irregular\u201d policy-making that he witnessed over the summer provide a roadmap to future testimony that could be even more harmful. Republicans have already begun to retreat from their \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d line, but they will have to keep retreating because Taylor has almost single-handedly decimated the few witnesses who have provided some testimony that is favorable to Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf I were one of the president\u2019s lawyers, I would counsel him to admit the obvious\u2014essentially to plead guilty and admit this was, in fact, a quid pro quo\u2014and try and convince Congress and the public that it is not as bad as it looks. In my experience, defendants who stubbornly try to deny the obvious in the face of overwhelming evidence rarely convince anyone.\n\nTaylor, a Trump appointee who served as an Army officer in Vietnam before embarking on a long government and diplomatic career in both Republican and Democratic administrations, testified that military aid to Ukraine appropriated by Congress\u2014and a White House meeting sought by the Ukrainian government\u2014were both conditioned on a public announcement of investigations that would have aided Trump politically.\n\nTaylor was crystal clear on that point. He testified that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\u2014a hotel tycoon and major Trump donor\u2014told him that Trump wanted to put Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cin a public box\u201d by forcing him to make a public statement ordering investigations of Ukraine\u2019s alleged role in the 2016 U.S. election as well as the gas company, Burisma, where Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was a board member. \u201cEverything,\u201d Taylor said he was told, was dependent on that public announcement.\n\nThis demand was communicated to the Ukrainian government. Sondland told Taylor that he told Zelensky and one of his top advisors, Andrey Yermak, that if Zelensky did not speak publicly, Ukraine would not receive the military aid it needed, according to Taylor. Somehow, Sondland, in a now well-known text to Taylor, still tried to insist that the president did not consider this kind of conditional agreement a quid pro quo.\n\nTaylor, operating in the normal diplomatic channel rather than the one run by Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani, testified that he and others\u2014including Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin)\u2014advised the Ukrainian government not to jeopardize bipartisan support for Ukraine by getting drawn into U.S. domestic politics. The Ukrainians told Taylor that President Zelensky \u201cdid not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. re-election campaign.\u201d After the ultimatum was conveyed to Ukraine, Zelensky agreed to make a public statement, although the aid was released without a statement after its holdup was made public.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Taylor confronted Sondland and tried to convince him to halt this effort. Sondland and former U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker explained to Taylor that Trump is a businessman, and \u201cwhen a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something,\u201d he \u201casks that person to pay up before signing the check.\u201d\n\nAs Taylor noted, this \u201cmade no sense\u201d because the Ukrainians \u201cdid not owe President Trump anything\u201d and \u201cholding up security assistance for domestic political gain was crazy.\u201d Trump was holding up tax dollars, appropriated by Congress, to force Ukraine to announce an investigation into the son of his political rival\u2014and risking Ukrainian lives in the process.\n\nGiven Taylor\u2019s devastating testimony, it\u2019s unsurprising that some Republicans are backing off the \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d line that has been part of Trump\u2019s defense for weeks. Some of Trump\u2019s defenders, such as Senator Lindsey Graham, continue to argue that there was no quid pro quo because the Ukrainian president publicly denied that there was one.\n\nThis line is unlikely to hold up in the upcoming weeks. Taylor\u2019s testimony is a roadmap that strongly suggests additional investigative steps that will undercut attempts to contradict his testimony that Trump conditioned military aid on an announcement of investigations.\n\nFor one thing, Taylor\u2019s testimony undercuts the prior testimony of other witnesses like Sondland and Volker. At best, their prior testimony was incomplete and misleading. At worst, it was materially false, which could lead Congress to hold them in contempt\u2014an option some Members have already suggested. Even Congressman Will Hurd (R-Texas) has suggested that Sondland needs to come back to testify again. (On Wednesday, associates of Sondland tried to align his story more closely with Taylor\u2019s by suggesting Sondland was unaware initially of the linkage between the military aid and Trump\u2019s request for investigations.)\n\nBut that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Taylor testified that he raised these concerns with then-National Security Advisor John Bolton, who Taylor said referred to Trump\u2019s pressuring of Ukraine as a \u201cdrug deal\u201d and opposed a call between Trump and Zelensky because he feared it \u201cwould be a disaster.\u201d Bolton, who has since resigned, has not spoken publicly. What would he say if called to testify?\n\nTaylor privately met with Bolton and expressed his serious concerns to him during this process, and, according to Taylor, Bolton recommended that he write a cable directly to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Taylor wrote that cable on August 29, calling the Trump pressure effort \u201cfolly\u201d and stating that he \u201cwould not defend such a policy.\u201d Taylor said Pompeo never responded to him but he heard that Pompeo carried the cable with him to a White House meeting.\n\nPompeo has a lot of explaining to do. When interviewed on Sunday by George Stephanopoulos, Pompeo looked like a deer in the headlights, awkwardly pausing and refusing to answer fundamental questions about his role. Pompeo argues executive privilege, and it\u2019s unlikely a court battle to compel his testimony would be resolved quickly, but pressure could mount for his testimony as the impeachment inquiry advances. Unlike some others in Trump\u2019s inner circle, Pompeo has future political aspirations and reportedly has weighed a run for U.S. Senate in Kansas. He can\u2019t afford to be Trump\u2019s fall guy.\n\nNeither can Sondland, who in his prior testimony didn\u2019t display the defiance and disdain that characterized the Congressional testimony of Trump allies like former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Taylor\u2019s testimony was full of damaging details about Sondland, like his insistence that calls with Zelensky were not transcribed. In Taylor\u2019s account, Sondland comes off like someone trying to hide conduct that he knew was wrongful. He will have difficulty explaining why our nation\u2019s envoy to Ukraine was not permitted to read the transcript of Zelensky\u2019s call with Trump until it was released publicly two months after the fact.\n\nIt is clear from Taylor\u2019s testimony that more is to come. A smart defense team would get ahead of this by admitting that there was a quid pro quo, falling back to the argument advanced by some on the right like Tucker Carlson\u2014that the conduct was wrong but that impeachment is too severe of a remedy.\n\nIf Republicans quickly admitted what Trump did but insisted that they wanted the American people to decide Trump\u2019s fate in December, they might reduce the damage and move past this episode, assuming they had the votes in the U.S. Senate to prevent conviction. If Trump refuses to allow them to adopt that strategy, he becomes Republicans\u2019 own worst enemy. Because if Taylor\u2019s testimony is any guide, they will reach that point eventually, and the road getting there will be rocky for the administration.", "description": "After the Ukrainian envoy\u2019s bombshell testimony, the best Trump can hope for is mercy.", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Renato Mariotti"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c8/f7/ebd576ce4c8c99f6b8d4d81f511b/191023-mariotti-trump-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
