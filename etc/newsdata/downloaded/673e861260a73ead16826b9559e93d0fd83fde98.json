There is no suggestion either athlete has been involved in doping.\n\nAn angry Hassan said she was happy to be tested \u201cevery single day\u201d to prove she was a clean athlete.\n\n\u201cI believe in clean sport, I\u2019m always clean, I will always be clean. I believe in the Oregon Project. I\u2019ve seen Alberto. He\u2019s worked really hard and that is what I know,\u201d she said in an emotional outburst after running the sixth-fastest time in history to win the 1,500m.\n\nA defiant Farah hit back at critics on Friday, saying he was never given banned drugs while a member of the Oregon group, adding he\u2019s \u201cone of the most tested athletes in the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not done anything wrong. These allegations, let\u2019s be clear here, are about Alberto Salazar,\u201d Farah said at Friday\u2019s news conference ahead of the Chicago Marathon.\n\nFarah, who has never tested positive, waited more than two years after the accusations were first made against Salazar before parting ways with the coach in October 2017.\n\n\u201cAt the time there was no allegation against me. There was an allegation against Alberto Salazar,\u201d he said.\n\nFarah will run in the Chicago Marathon on Sunday, with Galen Rupp, another NOP athlete, also taking part.\n\nNike\u2019s decision to shut down the Oregon Project came after athletes including US runner Kara Goucher, who was coached by Salazar from 2004 to 2011 and provided key evidence in the case against him, told the BBC that Nike could not justify keeping it open.\n\n\u201cIt has to go,\u201d Goucher said. \u201cIf I was Nike I\u2019d be bringing in some new coaches and move on from this Oregon Project, because clearly it had principles not in line with clean sport and we have to just start over.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Brown, a Texas endocrinologist who treated many of Salazar\u2019s athletes at the Oregon training hub in Portland, was also suspended for four years.\n\nNike\u2019s share price has been hit by the Salazar scandal but following Friday\u2019s announcement, it was up 1.08 percent at $94.00 in early trade in New York.\n\nThe US company has $4.5 billion in annual running-related sales, according to Bloomberg data, and it is the biggest sponsor of running around the world.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Nike said on Friday it was shutting down its Oregon Project distance-running group that has produced a host of world and Olympic", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/2ae22c_alberto-salazar-was-banned-years-doping-nike-shuts-oregon-project-group-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
