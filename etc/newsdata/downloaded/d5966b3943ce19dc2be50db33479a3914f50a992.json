Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), who has long opposed any U.S. efforts to undermine Bashar al-Assad\u2019s brutal regime, sparred with Mayor Pete Buttigieg over how the U.S. should extract itself from the long-running conflict.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war,\u201d she said.\n\nLast week, Trump announced that 50 U.S. troops stationed on Syria\u2019s northern border with Turkey would be pulled deeper south into the country. After the announcement, Turkey immediately invaded, slaughtering Kurdish fighters and civilians, and horrifying the international community. The Kurds fought ISIS alongside U.S. troops, and Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. protection for them was widely viewed as a betrayal that seriously harms America\u2019s international credibility.\n\n\u201cWe need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution,\u201d Gabbard said.\n\nButtigieg lit into Gabbard.\n\n\u201cRespectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it is a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values. Look, I didn\u2019t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan, but it\u2019s also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we\u2019re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nGabbard pressed him on his answer, asking if he would keep the U.S. in Syria indefinitely.\n\n\u201cY ou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy, as you\u2019re doing,\u201d he retorted.\n\n\u201cWhat is an endless war if it\u2019s not a regime change war?\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d he replied.\n\nThe skirmish encapsulated the tension within the Democratic Party on foreign policy. But neither is wooing voters in an outsize way: Buttigieg polls at just over 5 percent of the Democratic primary vote in the RealClearPolitics polling average, while Gabbard is just under 1 percent.", "description": "The Hawaii congresswoman characterized the Syria conflict as an \u2018ongoing regime change war\u2019 and faced a swift rebuke from the South Bend mayor.", "authors": ["Betsy Swan", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_674,w_1199,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571190840/RTS2RBN6_zat95y", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
