South Africa, in 2015, and Ireland, defeated on Saturday, have learned that lesson the hard way.\n\nSo while the Russians have lost both their opening games - 30-10 to Japan and 34-9 to Samoa \u2014 Laidlaw says Scotland will treat them with the greatest respect.\n\n\u201cEach team is getting better and better. If you\u2019re not on your game you\u2019re going to be put under pressure,\u201d Laidlaw told a news conference on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTheir set-piece has been excellent, their scrummaging is strong, they\u2019ve really come to enjoy themselves and play rugby and that has shone through in their performances.\u201d\n\nThere was much to like about Scotland\u2019s win in Kobe against a team that have proved tough customers in recent years.\n\nThe attacking performance aside, Scotland\u2019s much-criticized defence stood strong against the hulking Samoan ball carriers and held the Pacific islanders scoreless for the first time in 30 games at the World Cup.\n\nWith Ireland claiming a bonus point in their defeat to Japan, Scotland knew even a win over Samoa might not be enough when the quarter-final places are being decided. Getting that bonus point was crucial.\n\n\u201cWe knew the circumstances. If we never performed we\u2019d be packing our bags and going home,\u201d said Laidlaw, still sporting a black eye from the game.\n\nPatience had been the key to getting those vital four tries, he added.\n\n\u201cWe never tried to chase the game too early, which was the message. But it\u2019s one thing talking about it and another thing executing.\n\n\u201cWe need to use that model going forward for the rest of the tournament. Russia have been impressive so far so we need to get that game right.\u201d\n\nScotland play Russia on Oct. 9 in Shizuoka before facing the hosts four days later in Yokohama.\n\nLaidlaw says the squad must take it one game at a time: \u201cWe have a job to do against Russia, we can\u2019t look past that.", "description": "Scotland's final Pool A clash with Japan is looming as a quarter-final eliminator but for scrumhalf Greig Laidlaw the improvements shown by lower-tier sides at the Rugby World Cup means it would be a mistake to look beyond their next opponents Russia.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436221672&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910WE"}
