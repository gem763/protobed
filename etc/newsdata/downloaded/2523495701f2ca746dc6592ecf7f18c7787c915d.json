In the first half of this year, there was a record high of more than 6.08 million tourists, an increase of nearly 100,000 from the same period a year earlier.\n\n\"Dongxing has become a popular tourist destination, Vietnamese shop assistants are welcome here,\" said Liang Zhouhua, Hoai's employer.\n\nHoai said: \"I have adapted to the lifestyle of working in China and living in Vietnam.\"\n\nXinhua", "description": "NANNING - Every morning, Beilun Bridge swarms with thousands of Vietnamese commuters passing through the Dongxing border port on their way to work in China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9e9059a310cf3e97a06d57.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
