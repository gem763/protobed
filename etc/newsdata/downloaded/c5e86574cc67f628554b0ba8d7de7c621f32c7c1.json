These are laptops that you could realistically use all day at the office and then for intense gaming sessions when you get home. We\u2019ve already rounded up most of the models that have come out over the past year \u2014 and RTX mobile graphics are on their way \u2014 but Dell\u2019s Alienware brand was missing from the group because it had yet to release a Max Q laptop.\n\nThe m15 is what fills that gap. It\u2019s Alienware\u2019s first laptop with an Nvidia Max Q card in it. As a result, it\u2019s also Alienware\u2019s thinnest and lightest gaming laptop ever, and it stands out from the rest of the brand\u2019s behemoths. The m15 also comes equipped with a numpad, a broad selection of ports, and even different lid colors. And at $1,379 to start, the m15 costs less than most of its competitors.\n\nBut this field is intensely competitive, and the m15 is not as thin or as light as the best of the bunch, making it a bit of a tough sell, even at a lower price.\n\nOur review of Alienware m15 Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Good starting price\n\nSolid build quality\n\nGaming performance on par with competitors\n\nGreat battery life Bad Stuff Underside is way too hot to use on your lap\n\nThicker and heavier than other Max Q gaming laptops\n\nBezels are atrocious\n\nNo Windows Hello login options\n\nCramped QWERTY keyboard layout Buy for $1,379.99 from Alienware\n\nAlienware m15 specs Intel Core i7-8750H (6-Core, 9MB Cache, up to 4.1GHz w/ Turbo Boost)\n\n15.6-inch IPS FHD 144Hz display (7ms response time and 300-nits brightness)\n\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Max-Q w/ 8GB GDDR5\n\n16GB DDR4 RAM, 2666MHz\n\n512GB NVMe SSD\n\nKiller Wireless 1550 2x2 AC and Bluetooth 5.0\n\nWindows 10\n\nWeighs 4.78 pounds\n\nAt first glance, the m15 is familiar to anyone who has seen an Alienware machine before: it\u2019s loud and colorful, with hard corners and glowing alien heads. Alienware offers the m15 in red or silver. Somehow, during the course of my testing, it\u2019s grown on me. There\u2019s a trend from gaming laptop manufacturers to produce work-friendly Max Q machines that aren\u2019t so obnoxious-looking, but Alienware doesn\u2019t seem concerned about that. Instead, the m15\u2019s design prioritizes airflow and the tank-like qualities that Alienware machines are known for.\n\nAs a result, the m15 has plenty of visible air vents as part of its dual-intake and dual-exhaust airflow design. But unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t count for much when I\u2019m trying to use the m15 on my lap.\n\nThe underside of the m15 gets too hot for any lap\n\nThe m15\u2019s chassis gets uncomfortably hot on the bottom, only moderately cooling down when I turn down performance settings in Windows 10. Otherwise, the m15 is best used on a desk. This is far from ideal, and it\u2019s the exact opposite of what so many of the m15\u2019s competitors are capable of. Thankfully, heat doesn\u2019t permeate through the palm rests (which are also fingerprint magnets), but it does become noticeable near the top function row of the keyboard. Although I had similar issues with Razer\u2019s Blade 15, at least the thermal management on its underside made it cool enough to use on my lap instead of ironing my pants like the m15 does.\n\nUnlike many of the other Max Q gaming machines, the m15\u2019s aesthetic sticks out like a sore thumb in a work environment, especially in a conference room. In a meeting or cafe, there\u2019s a good chance I would get awkwardly stared at, or, at the very least, be self-conscious that I was using a laptop with a glowing alien head, multicolor keyboard, and red exterior.\n\nThe m15 has a plethora of ports\n\nThe m15 weighs 4.78 pounds, measures 17.9 millimeters (0.70 inches) at its thinnest point and 21 millimeters (0.83 inches) at its thickest point. With Alienware\u2019s eccentric styling, its footprint is significantly larger than that of other Max Q gaming laptops. This may be Alienware\u2019s thinnest and lightest laptop, but it\u2019s still chunky and heavy compared to a Razer Blade 15 or MSI GS65 Stealth Thin (which weigh 4.63 and 4.4 pounds, respectively).\n\nOne area where the m15 bests its competitors is battery life. In my battery test, which included the AlienFX spectrum keyboard lighting, Windows 10\u2019s \u201cbetter performance mode,\u201d Bluetooth off, and brightness at 50 percent, the m15 would last between five and six hours on a charge. Getting up to six hours of battery life is actually quite good for a gaming laptop, even if it\u2019s far less than most standard laptops can manage. By comparison, the Blade 15 averages around five hours, while the MSI GS65 often taps out just before the six-hour mark.\n\nThere is one thing about the m15\u2019s design that Alienware completely missed: there\u2019s no way you can ignore the Alienware m15\u2019s huge bezels. Actually, I don\u2019t think I can call them bezels at all; these are huge, plastic borders that don\u2019t even match the m15\u2019s overall design language, and they are so glossy that they reflect your image and collect dust. Even worse, they\u2019re immense fingerprint magnets, are easily susceptible to light scruffs, and, to top it off, they completely kill the sense of immersion when playing games.\n\nUnsightly bezels for days\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s no Windows Hello IR camera around the screen or a fingerprint reader for more secure logins. With all of that chassis space, you would think Alienware would give the m15 more convenient login options than just a four-digit PIN, especially considering it\u2019s nearly a $2,000 machine when fully equipped.\n\nOn the other hand, the Alienware m15\u2019s screen is excellent: it\u2019s fast, bright, and vibrant. With a matte 15.6-inch, 144Hz IPS display at 1080p resolution, the m15\u2019s screen maxes out at 300-nits of brightness, which is great for indoor viewing but not easily visible if used outdoors. Reflections and environmental lighting in games are detailed and sharp, while the solid blacks made possible by the IPS panel makes watching Netflix a pleasant experience. Viewing angles around the screen are also good, with little to no discoloration when viewed from the sides or top-down. The m15\u2019s screen is not as color-accurate as the Gigabyte Aero 15\u2019s or as immersive as the MSI GS65\u2019s, but it\u2019s a good display that\u2019s capable of all the things it should be.\n\nThe Alienware m15 with a GeForce GTX 1070 Max Q plays games pretty well. We\u2019ve already seen the Core i7-8750H and GTX 1070 Max Q processor / GPU combo in many laptops from other OEMs like Razer, MSI, Asus, and Gigabyte, with similar performance across the board.\n\nGaming performance is comparable to other Max Q laptops\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise to see the m15 running Battlefield V at a comfortable 80 fps on ultra settings, proving it has performance similar to its competition. Older and less graphically intensive games like Rainbow Six Siege, League of Legends, and Overwatch will all run closer to the m15\u2019s native 144hz refresh rate, with all of the graphical presets maxed out.\n\nAs a productivity machine, the m15 doesn\u2019t look the part, but it works just fine for typing out long documents, checking emails, and touching up in Photoshop and Lightroom. The Windows Precision touchpad is large, smooth to the touch, and accurate at every corner. It\u2019s rather useless for playing PC games, but otherwise, I don\u2019t have any gripes with it.\n\nHowever, I am a bit disappointed with the m15\u2019s cramped keyboard layout that includes a numpad alongside a regular QWERTY layout. Normally, I\u2019m all for numpads in PC gaming because of the additional mappable inputs \u2014 it\u2019s not just useful for filing taxes! \u2014 but in the m15\u2019s case, the numpad forced Alienware to further shrink the letter keys that already feel fairly small to begin with. It\u2019s not a deal-breaker, but if you\u2019re like me and prefer having a gaming laptop QWERTY be centered below the screen, then you might not be fond of the m15\u2019s layout.\n\nThe keyboard is a bit too cramped for my tastes\n\nEach one of the m15\u2019s keys supports AlienFX, Alienware\u2019s lighting management app, and can be programmed to display preset color configurations or your custom ones. And like previous Alienware machines, you can adjust the alien head logo\u2019s lighting (or turn it off) as well.\n\nOtherwise, the keyboard feels average, despite the eye candy and unique font that Alienware has set. Each key has 1.4mm of travel, so actuations are fairly immediate, with enough dampening for comfortable typing. Although I might prefer the MSI GS65\u2019s keyboard over the m15\u2019s, it\u2019s still acceptable.\n\nThe m15 is too lackluster to outshine its rivals\n\nIn a vacuum, the m15 is impressive: it\u2019s thinner and lighter than prior Alienware laptops, while still providing an excellent gaming experience and surprisingly good battery life when you\u2019re not gaming. But it does not exist in a vacuum, and it\u2019s not as thin, light, well-designed, or immersive as its competition. Even with a starting price that undercuts Razer, MSI, and others, the Alienware m15 doesn\u2019t stand out.", "description": "Alienware\u2019s m15 is behind the competition and it shows. The m15 is thicker, heavier, and runs warmer than its counterparts. But in exchange, you get a much lower starting price, stronger battery life, and a plethora of ports. Thing is, it\u2019s still not entirely worth it.", "authors": ["Stefan Etienne", "Jan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/80TCeWEoYa42rTJm5sp8rRofBYs=/0x284:2040x1352/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13711511/akrales_181212_3125_0074_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-24"}
