Let's reexamine.\n\n2: Tesla Comparison - Reader Robjay\n\n\"What a skewed story! I own a one year old Tesla model 3 long range battery (325 miles). In one year I waited only once for 10 minutes to get a Tesla charger. Each Tesla supercharger station has at least 8 chargers. I will continue to pay $10.02, at the highest rate, to fully charge my 325 mile battery car. I will drive knowing I AM helping the environment.

So gas car owners are FORCED to spend hours per year pulling into smelly gas stations and pumping gas, instead of a few seconds every night at home.\"\n\nTo be fair, the calculation is skewed to the low side because it includes a sizable number of people who are not old enough to drive, those who are disabled, etc.\n\nWe can improve upon that by looking at population groups.\n\nPopulation vs Working Age Population\n\nThere are about 329 million people in the US. Of that number, there are about 207 million aged 15-64.\n\n207 million is thus a better starting point than 329 million as a potential car ownership age.\n\n207/328 is 63% but a lot of people over the age of 64 still drive. 63% is on the low side.\n\nPopulation by Age Category\n\n70% of the population is between 20 and 79. There are 18- and 19-year-olds who own cars, and some number of those over 79 tears old still driving.\n\n70% of 329 million is 230 million.\n\nAfter age 64, people might get away more easily with one car than two, but that is at least a very reasonable car ownership age range.\n\n70% is probably on the high side.\n\nA still better way to calculate ownership and EV percentage usage is to look at the number of licensed drivers.\n\nLicensed Drivers\n\n\"In 2009, 87 percent of the driving-age population (age 16 and over) have a license. There are 685 drivers for every 1,000 residents. In 1960, just a few years after all states required driver licensing, there were only 487 drivers for every 1,000 residents.\"\n\nAll these numbers are similar but let's use 685 drivers per 1,000 population as the best representation of what's going on. The number conveniently lies between 63% and 70% so all the numbers realistically tie together.\n\nPercentage of EVs Per Licensed Driver\n\nIn the US there are 3.4 plug-in electric cars per 685 licensed drivers.\n\n(3.4 / 685) * 100 = 0.49%\n\nA mere 0.49% of licensed drivers have a plug-in vehicle, and that includes hybrids!\n\nIn California, thanks to extra incentives, there are 13.2 plug-in electric cars per 685 licensed drivers. That percentage is a \"whopping\" 1.9%.\n\nBasic Reality\n\nIf EVs were so damn superior, then usage would certainly top 0.49%.\n\nLike it or not, the public does not believe EVs to be superior, taking price into consideration. There is no other possible conclusion.\n\nWe can debate the order, but at the top of the list has to be initial cost vs gasoline-vehicles, lack of charging stations, long trips, etc.\n\nNow let's compare what I said.\n\nWhen Do EV Vehicles Make Sense?\n\nCurrently, nowhere, from a cost standpoint. People buy EVs or hybrids on the questionable belief they are doing something for the environment. For those who very seldom drive at all and for those whom walking, public transportation, or Uber is a viable option, no car of any kind makes economic sense. However, for those who demand the convenience of having a car, the points made below apply. If and when the cost of an EV is no more than the cost of a gas-powered vehicle (factoring in gas, insurance, life of car, maintenance costs) EVs become practical for those who seldom if ever drive more than 150 mile or so before a known lengthy stop that also happens to have a charger. For most, the charging station needs to be home or work. Until batteries charge as fast or nearly as fast fueling a gas-powered vehicle or readily available battery swapping stations exist, EVs will not make sense for a big percentage of drivers.\n\n1-Revisited: \"Nowhere, from a cost standpoint,\" is very accurate. At a 0.49% rate, the public agrees. Even with California's incentives the rate only gets to 1.9%. The rest of the country has a laughable 0.25% rate of acceptance.\n\nIn 2018 a the plug-in rate for new car sales was a mere 2.1% with most of that in California.\n\n2-Revisited: \"For those who seldom drive, buying a car of any kind makes little economic sense.\" My statement was accurate.\n\n3-Revisited: If and when the cost of an EV is no more than the cost of a gas-powered vehicle (factoring in gas, insurance, life of car, maintenance costs) EVs become practical for those who seldom if ever drive more than 150 mile or so before a known lengthy stop that also happens to have a charger. For most, the charging station needs to be home or work.\n\nMy original statements are accurate. Those who demand the convenience of a car, especially those who make frequent, short trips, EVs are an option. A Tesla for short-haul trips makes no sense.\n\nReaders might point out that driving a Bolt the distance the NYT stated is a mistake, but the point was missed: One should not drive a Bolt long distances unless one is prepared to suffer the consequences experienced by the NYT author.\n\nA 2019 Chevrolet Bolt gets \"Up to 238 mile of electric range on a full Charge\". That is certainly pathetic and Tesla owners are right to laugh. I would not buy a Bolt, but some people do. If they do, they should not try to drive long distances.\n\n4-Revisited: \"Until batteries charge as fast or nearly as fast fueling a gas-powered vehicle or readily available battery swapping stations exist, EVs will not make sense for a big percentage of drivers.\"\n\nThat is my exact original statement but I did now emphasize \"big percentage\". The statement is entirely accurate.\n\nI could have added that I believe it will happen.\n\nIn the body of the article, I stated, \"For many, we are a decade away unless and until there are readily available super-fast charging or swapping stations.\"\n\nThat is certainly accurate, especially because I said \"many\", not most. However, \"most\" may very well be accurate.\n\nElectric Vehicle Sales Forecast\n\nPlease consider Electric Vehicle Sales Forecast and the Charging Infrastructure Required Through 2030 by the Edison Foundation Institute for Electronic Innovation.\n\nKey EEI/IEI Points\n\nThe stock of EVs (i.e., the number of EVs on the road) is projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from slightly more than 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030.\n\nIt took 8 years to sell 1 million EVs. We project the next 1 million EVs will be on the road in less than 3 years\u2014by early 2021.\n\nAnnual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. Compared to our 2017 forecast, EV sales are estimated to be 1.4 million in 2025 versus 1.2 million.\n\nAbout 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure.\n\nMish vs EEI/IEI\n\nThe EEI/IEI forecast is that 7% of 259 million cares on US roads in 2030 will be electric.\n\nLet's assume that forecast is off by a factor of 7. If so, the percentage becomes 49%.\n\nMy own forecast is 50%, so I am hardly an EV bear as accused. In fact, I may be a wild-eyed optimist.\n\nSome People Can't Read\n\nDuh what if you need to drive 800 miles?\n\n\n\nSome people can't read\n\n\n\nThen again perhaps the proposal is to drive the home 800 miles https://t.co/qalEFpIl9p \u2014 Mike Mish Shedlock (@MishGEA) June 23, 2019\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nWhat transpired is a huge number of Tesla and EV owners are defending their purchases. Many of these owners are self-proclaimed, environmentally-superior human beings out to save the world from the evils of cheaper but polluting cars.\n\nThese environmental thumpers ignore the coal-burning to produce electricity (about a 30% share), the mining of Lithium, infrastructure costs, and cost of electricity if and when we do get to 50% EV ownership.\n\nSpiraling Environment Cost of Lithium\n\nWired comments on the Spiraling Environment Cost of Lithium Addiction\n\nDemand for lithium is increasing exponentially, and it doubled in price between 2016 and 2018. According to consultancy Cairn Energy Research Advisors, the lithium ion industry is expected to grow from 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of annual production in 2017, to almost 800 GWhs in 2027. \u201cOne of the biggest environmental problems caused by our endless hunger for the latest and smartest devices is a growing mineral crisis, particularly those needed to make our batteries,\u201d says Christina Valimaki an analyst at Elsevier. In South America, the biggest problem is water. There\u2019s also the potential \u2013 as occurred in Tibet \u2013 for toxic chemicals to leak from the evaporation pools into the water supply. These include chemicals, including hydrochloric acid, which are used in the processing of lithium into a form that can be sold, as well as those waste products that are filtered out of the brine at each stage. In Australia and North America, lithium is mined from rock using more traditional methods, but still requires the use of chemicals in order to extract it in a useful form. Research in Nevada found impacts on fish as far as 150 miles downstream from a lithium processing operation. In Argentina\u2019s Salar de Hombre Muerto, locals claim that lithium operations have contaminated streams used by humans and livestock, and for crop irrigation. In Chile, there have been clashes between mining companies and local communities, who say that lithium mining is leaving the landscape marred by mountains of discarded salt and canals filled with contaminated water with an unnatural blue hue. \u201cLike any mining process, it is invasive, it scars the landscape, it destroys the water table and it pollutes the earth and the local wells,\u201d said Guillermo Gonzalez, a lithium battery expert from the University of Chile, in a 2009 interview. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a green solution \u2013 it\u2019s not a solution at all.\u201d\n\nSo much for the zero pollution idea.\n\nAbout Tesla\n\nTo top it off, the Tesla owners make better-than-thou claims despite spontaneously-exploding batteries, laughable crash-prone automated navigation systems, poor paint jobs, bumpers that fall off, and a myriad of other reported problems that no one sees on any other car in existence.\n\nPublic Acceptance\n\nClaims of hatchet jobs are by people who cannot read, don't understand the points made, and ignore car purchase costs. The group also includes those who mistakenly believe the EVs don't pollute and Teslas don't explode.\n\nPublic acceptance is where the rubber meets the road. In the US, it's 2% of new car sales, mostly in California.\n\nIf You Build It They Will Come\n\nA friend who lives in DC just pinged me with this comment: \"Even here in the East Coast, where it's non-stop city from DC to NYC, it's hard to 'fill up' an electric car. Until the electric infrastructure is built out, no chance.\"\n\nBingo.\n\nI have a far greater likelihood of this happening than EEI/IEI because I expect a faster rollout. Regardless, two things need to happen.\n\nTruly convenient charging that the public accepts. Up front ownership costs in the ballpark of gas-powered cars, also that the public accepts.\n\nStates need to build the infrastructure. Imagine 30% EV share on the existing infrastructure. Hour-long waits except at home might just be the norm.\n\nFactor in the fact that condos and apartments buildings likely don't have charging stations.\n\n\"Duh, charge at home\". Yeah, right.\n\nGonna hang that power cord out the window of a 13-story apartment building?", "description": "An alleged \"Hatchet Job\" by the NYT stirred up a .10/07/2019 19:31:20PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Sarah Lee"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/102/df32a048-3bc3-4186-899e-5ca28964251d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-14"}
