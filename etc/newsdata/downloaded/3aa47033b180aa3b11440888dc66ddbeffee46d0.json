My child\u2019s going under anesthesia and I don't know what to expect\n\nYou wouldn't be human if you didn\u2019t have a mountain of questions. Medical professional Dr Clover-Ann Lee answers your FAQs about children and anaesthesia.\n\nDoes the idea of your baby, toddler or child needing anaesthesia for a medical procedure fill you with anxiety?\n\n\n\nWell, you would not be human if you didn't have a mountain of questions.\n\n\n\nDr Clover-Ann Lee is a specialist paediatric anaesthetist and Head of Anaesthetics at Joburg's Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital.\n\n\n\nShe has answered some of the most common questions parents ask about anesthesia in kids.\n\nWhat is a general anaesthetic?\n\nA general anaesthetic is medication given to children so they cannot see, hear or feel anything during a medical procedure.\n\n\n\nAn anaesthetist administers it (sometimes called an anesthesiologist): a specialist doctor who also takes care of your child during the procedure.\n\n\n\nTheir role is to make sure your child is comfortable and well throughout the procedure, and their pain is well managed and kept to a minimum.\n\nWhat\u2019s the role of the anaesthetist?\n\nEvery person in the operating theatre is invested in your child\u2019s health and safety.\n\nThe anaesthetist is the person who makes sure everything goes well: that your child gets ample oxygen, that their blood pressure stays stable, and that they do not awaken during the procedure.\n\nYou will probably meet the doctor, surgeon or physician before the big day.\n\nHowever, you may only meet your child\u2019s anaesthetist on the day of their procedure.\n\nThe surgeon is responsible for the outcome of the procedure. But overall, the safety of the patient is the primary responsibility of the anaesthetist.\n\nHow can I prepare my child for receiving an anaesthetic?\n\nIt depends a lot on how old your child is.\n\n\n\nTeens and tweens benefit from as much information as you can give them.\n\n\n\nAll children (from babies to teens) need to know what to expect, and that you'll be there to help them through the experience.\n\n\n\nTalk to your child in words and language they understand.\n\n\n\nFor young children, it's enough to say that the doctor is going to give them a particular medicine that will make them fall asleep.\n\n\n\nThe medical team will be dressed in the theatre gear when the child is taken into the theatre.\n\n\n\nPrepare them for this, as they will be expecting to see the familiar face of their doctor.\n\n\n\nTell them the doctors will be wearing pyjamas and will look silly.\n\n\n\nAlso, tell them the doctors wear certain clothes to make sure there are no bad germs in the room.\n\n\n\nThey are there to keep them safe.\n\n\n\nReassure them that you will be there at the time they go to sleep, and also when they wake up.\n\n\n\nPrepare them by telling them they might feel a bit to feel uncomfortable when the wake-up, but the doctor has medicine for that.\n\n\n\nChildren who know what to expect tend to manage the experience of anaesthesia well.\n\nRead More: Epidurals and spinal blocks\n\nWhat about food and liquid? What\u2019s safe and what isn\u2019t?\n\nPlease follow the instructions the doctor provides to you in a letter.\n\n\n\nThe protective reflexes that prevent food in our stomachs from coming up and going into our lungs are relaxed under anaesthesia.\n\n\n\nThis is why your child's stomach must be empty before an anaesthetic.\n\n\n\nGenerally, offer a light meal or formula feed no less than six hours before anaesthetic.\n\n\n\nBreastfeeding is okay no less than four hours before anaesthetic and sips of clear, non-fizzy liquid are okay no less than two hours before anaesthetic.\n\n\n\nTo make it easier on your child, please don't eat or drink in front of them when they are not allowed to have food or drinks.\n\nWhat can we expect once we get to the hospital?\n\nYour child\u2019s anaesthetist will visit you and your child in the ward before the procedure.\n\nThey'll ask a few questions.\n\nIt\u2019s important to answer all these questions honestly.\n\nIt\u2019s especially important to tell the anaesthetist if your child has had the flu or a cold in the last few weeks.\n\nThis is also a great opportunity to ask the anaesthetist any questions or tell them about concerns you may have.\n\nThis will help you feel more relaxed, and a relaxed parent ensures a calmer kid!\n\nWhat happens in the operating theatre?\n\nRest assured that the medical team will take good care of your child.\n\nGeneral anaesthetic medicine is either injected into a vein or given as a gas that\u2019s administered by a mask placed over your child\u2019s nose and mouth.\n\nThe anaesthetist will be with your child throughout the procedure, making sure they remain asleep, monitoring then continuously and giving whatever fluid, medication and pain-relieving medicine they require.\n\nCan I go into the operating theatre with my child?\n\nOf course!\n\n\n\nIn most cases, one parent is welcome to accompany their child into theatre.\n\nBut it\u2019s fine, too, if you\u2019d rather not go into theatre with your child.\n\nYour child will drop off to sleep really quickly once the anaesthetic drugs kick in.\n\nThen you\u2019ll be asked to leave the theatre to let the doctors get on with their work.\n\nIf you do go into theatre, you can bring their favourite snuggly toy or blankie to reassure them.\n\nDistracting games on an iPad or phone are great, too.\n\nYou are also welcome to chat to your child as they fall asleep.\n\nA parent\u2019s reassuring chatter distracts the child while the anaesthetic takes effect.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to be there when they regain consciousness, so wait outside the recovery room so you can be called when they are fully conscious and need your presence and support.\n\nAnd afterwards? What should we expect then?\n\nThey might seem disoriented and upset for a few moments.\n\nThis is normal.\n\nReassure them that everything\u2019s fine, and offer them a toy, blanket or dummy perhaps if they are still a baby.\n\nDisturbed sleep patterns for a few days after anaesthetic are quite normal.\n\nThis should settle down soon.\n\nWhen is it safe to give them something to eat and drink after anaesthesia?\n\nThis largely depends on the kind of operation your child had, and your surgeon should guide you through this.\n\n\n\nAfter most minor procedures(hernia repairs, tonsillectomies and grommets, for example) they'll be able to drink as soon as they are awake enough.\n\n\n\nThe key is to let them have whatever they feel like, but not to push it.\n\nChildren know how they feel and might get sick if they eat and drink too much too soon.\n\nAre there any side effects and complications to look out for or worry about?\n\nMost side effects of anaesthesia are mild and will sort themselves out in a matter of hours or (at worst) a day or two.\n\n\n\nThese could include nausea, a sore throat and a headache.\n\n\n\nDepending on the surgery and the pain-management medication that's been prescribed, your child may also feel a little out of sorts for a few days and need more or longer daytime naps than usual.\n\n\n\nThis, too, will settle down after a few days.\n\nCall your doctor if there's anything you're worried about, or if something doesn't seem right to you.\n\nSeriously, what\u2019s the risk?\n\nWhile there's no guarantee that they're risk-free, anaesthetics are generally very safe.\n\n\n\nModern anaesthetic techniques, medication, monitoring and training continue to make anaesthesia safer.\n\nChat back:\n\nAre you still a bit anxious about anaesthetics?\n\n\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
