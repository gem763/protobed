Netflix previously projected global subscriber net adds for Q3 of 7 million (800,000 U.S. and 6.2 million internationally). As of the end of September 2019, Netflix had 158.3 million total paid subs, including 60.6 million in the U.S.\n\nNetflix reported Q3 revenue of $5.25 billion, up 31% year over year and in line with Wall Street estimates, and earnings per share of $1.47 topping analyst forecasts of EPS of $1.04.\n\nThe company posted operating margin of 18.7%, beating its prior guidance, \u201cdue to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4\u201919,\u201d the company said.\n\nInvestors breathed a sigh of relief on the earnings beat and subscriber adds \u2014 which may have been better than some feared \u2014 with the stock climbing as much as 10% in after-hours trading. The Q3 results certainly were a turnaround compared with the previous quarter, when Netflix fell significantly short of subscriber forecasts and lost U.S. customers (130,000) for the first time since 2011, when it split the DVD-by-mail and streaming services.\n\nNetflix\u2019s Q3 subscriber growth was aided by a relatively strong slate of content releases including \u201cStranger Things\u201d season 3 \u2014 which the company said was the most-watched season to date with 64 million member households viewing it in its first four weeks \u2014 and the seventh and final season of \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d The company claimed its third-quarter subscriber forecasts were its most accurate in the recent past.\n\nFor Q4, Netflix is forecasting 7.6 million global paid net adds, with 600,000 in the U.S. and 7.0 million for the international segment. Analysts had been pegging Netflix to add as many as 9.3 million net new paid subscribers (2 million U.S., 7.3 million overseas).\n\nNetflix blamed its U.S. price increase earlier this year for the slower domestic sub growth in 2019 to date. It has netted 2.1 million in the first nine months of the year vs. 4.1 million in the same period in 2018. Subscriber \u201cretention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels,\u201d Netflix noted in the letter to shareholders. The company hiked its standard plan from $10.99 to $12.99 per month, a change that rolled out primarily in Q2.\n\nBut Netflix also pointed out that the price hike has pumped up revenue, with average revenue per customer increasing 16.5% year over year in Q3. Overall, average revenue per customer was up 9% (and up 12% excluding impact of foreign currency exchange rates).\n\nIn recent months, Netflix investors have fretted about looming competition from major new competitors in the streaming space. Next month will see the debut of Disney Plus ($6.99 monthly) and Apple TV Plus ($4.99 per month) \u2014 both of which undercut Netflix\u2019s pricing, but will have far smaller content offerings out of the gate. Set to launch in early 2020 are WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max and NBCU\u2019s Peacock.\n\n\u201cThe launch of these new services will be noisy,\u201d Netflix said in its Q3 shareholder letter. \u201cThere may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long term, though, we expect we\u2019ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe company added, \u201cMany are focused on the \u2018streaming wars,\u2019 but we\u2019ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade.\u201d\n\nOriginal content releasing in the year-end quarter \u2014 historically Netflix\u2019s strongest period of subscriber gains \u2014 includes Martin Scorsese\u2019s critically lauded film \u201cThe Irishman\u201d starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino; season 3 of \u201cThe Crown\u201d; \u201cEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\u201d with Aaron Paul; season 2 of comedy series \u201cThe Kominsky Method\u201d; and live-action fantasy series \u201cThe Witcher.\u201d\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
