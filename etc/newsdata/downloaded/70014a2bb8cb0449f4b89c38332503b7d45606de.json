Peinovich grew up in liberal, affluent Montclair, N.J. All you really need to know about Peinovich\u2019s m.o. is that he hosts a podcast called \u201cThe Daily Shoah.\u201d Peinovich\u2019s father was so ashamed by his son\u2019s radicalization that after the Charlottesville rally in 2017, he asked Peinovich to change his name \u2014 eliciting bruised complaints from Peinovich about his father\u2019s abject insensitivity. \u201cPerhaps if you had shown more sympathy and interest in fairness,\u201d Mike Jr. wrote to Mike Sr., \u201cmy decision would be different.\u201d\n\nIs this a son who feels deeply hurt? Or is this a petulant man who has a preternatural gift for trolling? Could he be a bit of both \u2014 and does that mean anything? Marantz\u2019s wife was once a public defender who represented some people accused of \u201chorrifically violent\u201d crimes; if you believe in rehabilitation, do you also hold out hope that even a few of the people Marantz meets might be redeemed?\n\nQuestions like these come up again and again for Marantz, who is an essential part of this narrative, which has as much to do with the collapsing media ecosystem that allowed these people to flourish as it does with the people themselves. Marantz knows that his subjects see him as a stand-in for an insipid media elite \u2014 a boring category that he bristles at, though the lurid extremism he encounters forces him to accept that he\u2019s a \u201creluctant institutionalist.\u201d He finds himself feeling protective of a system that he knows is flawed but is better than the cruelly nihilistic alternative.\n\n\u201cOf all that I resented about the Deplorables,\u201d Marantz writes, \u201cone of the things I found most irksome was that they forced me to think like an establishment shill.\u201d\n\nMarantz meets a number of women who joined the alt-right movement. Some of their stories exude a dismal obliviousness: A former Bernie Sanders supporter and ardent Bob Dylan fan \u2014 \u201cone of the last true rebels,\u201d she gushes \u2014 busily assembles gift baskets for the DeploraBall in Washington while the male organizers do nothing to help her, scrolling through Twitter on their phones. Other trajectories are downright chilling: One woman ascended the ranks of the alt-right by appearing \u201cconfident enough to keep up with the guys, but subservient enough to know her place\u201d; she went from being a volunteer for the Obama campaign to someone who gave a Nazi salute.\n\nAs disturbing as these specific stories are, what filled me with a creeping sense of dread were the parts of \u201cAntisocial\u201d that incisively describe how a Darwinian information environment has degraded to the point where it now selects for people who can command the most attention with the fewest scruples. Marantz meets a 60-year-old \u201csurly racist\u201d with 25,000 subscribers on YouTube who, in another era, might have been relegated to muttering on his front porch.", "description": "Andrew Marantz weaves together profiles of online extremists with his memorable and often surreal reporting experiences.", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/books/09bookmarantz1/09bookmarantz1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
