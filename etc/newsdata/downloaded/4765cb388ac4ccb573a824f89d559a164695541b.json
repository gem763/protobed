Pam McNeal at Shady Maple Market in East Earl, Pennsylvania created this incredible life-size deer-shaped cake for a couple's wedding\n\nShady Maple Market posted the image on Facebook on October 3.\n\nThey haven't disclosed any details about the couple that ordered it, but the newlyweds are certainly creative.\n\nThe cake is painted to look quite realistic, and has a huge set of antlers on top of the head.\n\nAccording to Fox News, the anonymous bride and groom game in with the antlers and asked that a cake be made to fit them.\n\nThe head and neck are both made of styrofoam, but the rest of the design is made of enough cake to feed 250 people.\n\nImpressively, the whole thing took just ten hours to make.\n\nYikes! Another bride, Rena Davis, 52, was horrified after ordering a peacock cake for her wedding that arrived looking like this\n\nRequest: The Georgia-based bride has originally requested a wedding cake that looked like a simplified version of this design by a Texas bakery, but with fewer cupcakes and two birds\n\nThe cake certainly turned out much better than another animal-shaped wedding cake that a Georgia-based bride had last month.\n\nRena Davis, 52, enlisted a local baker in the town of Griffin to recreate a colorful peacock cake design she had seen online.\n\nBut the night before the wedding, the baker showed up on her doorstep with a monstrous concoction that her friend described as 'a turkey with leprosy.'\n\nThe friend, Annette Davis Hill, wrote on Facebook to warn others about the 'imposter that is trying to be a qualified cake decorator'.\n\nRena had sent her an image for reference, asking that it be tweaked to include two birds instead of one and fewer cupcakes.\n\nThe baker agreed, but the night before the wedding, she dropped off the cake and ran. It was not what the bride expected.\n\nYikes! The 'professional' cake decorator showed up with a virtually-transparent frosted creation, a far cry from the instructions she was given\n\nSinking: Due to the weight of the 'bird' being unsupported, its head kept toppling over so that it started to resemble an even more decrepit animal as the day went on\n\nNot a happy customer: Rena received the above design from the baker, for which she had paid $300, which kept collapsing and toppling over\n\n'One of the bird's heads falls off immediately (and proceeds to fall off two more times after that). The bride, near tears, fixes it as best she can each time and is devastated by how the cake looks,' Annette wrote.\n\n'The one \"peacock\" looks like a turkey with leprosy or something, and the 'white' bird, which isn't white at ALL, doesn't even have a tail or look like a bird in any way, it's just a brown BLOB,' she continued.\n\nThe cake maker came back after a phone call from the bride, bringing with her a pan of Rice Krispie treats which she told the bride she could use to 'reshape the birds'.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the baker told an upset Rena that she 'really didn't understand what they saw wrong with the cake'.\n\nThe baker also refused to refund her the $300.", "description": "An unidentified couple ordered a deer-shaped cake from\u00a0Shady Maple Market in East Earl, Pennsylvania.
