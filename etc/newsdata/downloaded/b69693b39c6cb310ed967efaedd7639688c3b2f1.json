The gauge, which uses a scale between 0 and 1, stood at 0.482 a year earlier.\n\nAlabama, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Virginia saw income inequality rise significantly last year. Washington, DC and Puerto Rico saw the highest Gini index readings, while Utah was among the lowest.\n\nReal median household income rose 0.8% to $61,937 in 2018, a slightly smaller increase than in the three previous years. The economy has expanded steadily over the last decade, which has helped to push the unemployment rate to historic lows.\n\nBut a majority of growth has gone to higher income earners and the owners of financial instruments, said Timothy Smeeding, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who studies poverty and economic mobility.\n\n\"Wages remain low, there is a lack of child care for single parent families and so on. Work alone won't solve poverty\u2014unless wages and earnings pick up substantially,\" he said. \"It still takes government aid for families with children and others who do not earn enough, despite working 40 plus hours a week.\"\n\nJay Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has echoed concerns about economic mobility in the US.
