In other words, a demo that\u2019s bound to be totally ineffective.\n\nLook past the inconvenience, the traffic chaos and the silly slogans and you won\u2019t see many \u2018crusties\u2019 (as Boris Johnson mistakenly described them) but fresh faced idealistic young people, pensioners and workers, writes Janet Street-Porter\n\nA protester carrying saplings to place in Old Palace Yard outside Parliament, during an Extinction Rebellion (XR) protest on Tuesday\n\nThe point of the current protests (which are also taking place in Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam and New York) is to achieve maximum publicity for their cause, to drive home the point that unless politicians start taking responsibility for the environment, we are just tinkering with the problem.\n\nThe reaction in some quarters has been astonishing. Boris Johnson described those taking part as \u2018importunate nose-ringed protestors\u2019, \u2018camped in hemp-smelling bivouacs\u2019 after he travelled (by car) to the launch of a book about Margaret Thatcher.\n\nLord Fraser, a former investment banker who was once Treasurer of the Tory party, took to the streets outside his posh house in Westminster in his white towelling dressing gown to berate the demonstrators for disturbing his sleep.\n\nAnd, is it smart to mock someone with Aspberger\u2019s? Piers Morgan sparked fury on social media today by imitating Greta Thunberg, on his morning TV show.\n\nAccording to Piers, Greta is just making kids scared. I disagree - she is inspiring a whole generation.\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists marking the 'opening ceremony' of their protest in Trafalgar Square were joined by Ruby Wax, Juliet Stevenson and Daisy Lowe (left to right) on Monday\n\nThis young girl has been mocked by the two most powerful men in the world President Trump and Vladimir Putin - who both patronisingly described her as \u2018nice\u2019.\n\nPutin, who has claimed that Greta is being exploited by climate change groups, is so uninformed about alternative energy sources that he recently criticised wind turbines for killing birds and disturbing worms!\n\nBoth men have no intention of taking climate change seriously - and the recent UN summit in New York ended without achieving anything of note.\n\nFor years, Greenpeace and other worthy charities have tried to get world leaders to understand the threat to the planet seriously. Greta - and the protest group Extinction Rebellion - have brought climate change to the front of the news agenda in a dramatic fashion.\n\nSince ER\u2019s demonstrations last April, thousands of people have joined the cause, people of all ages. Look at the demonstrators glued to buildings and camping out in London\u2019s Whitehall, the majority are certainly not hippies but ordinary people who feel passionately and want the rest of us to start demanding action too.\n\nI know how they feel. As a teenager, I marched in London against the war in Vietnam, against apartheid, and supported the Campaign for Nuclear disarmament.\n\nTwo women appear to enjoy a glass of wine and a meal of tomatoes and peppers on Tuesday morning after occupying Smithfield Market, which is a sea of tents and fruit and veg today\n\nAll these events were non-violent, except for one anti-war protest outside the US embassy in Grosvenor Square, when the police on horseback charged the marchers.\n\nThen, the mood changed and radical lefties got involved as a way of confronting a right wing government.\n\nThe poll tax riots in central London in 1990 ended in violence with buildings and vehicles being damaged and there were 339 arrests.\n\nBut the fury was matched by the mood of the electorate - 78% of whom did not agree with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s proposed new tax. And two years later, John Major cancelled it.\n\nThere was widespread criticism of the police tactics used to control demonstrators during the G20 protests in London, during which 35,000 people took to the streets. The following year, student protests against tuition fees saw violent confrontations and dozens of arrests.\n\nClimate change activists from Extinction Rebellion protest near Whitehall in central London on Tuesday\n\nEarlier this year, the police were criticised for not adopting more forceful tactics when Extinction Rebellion protestors took over Oxford Circus and blocked bridges for days on end.\n\nNow, the police are being taken to task again for not being more forceful. But they are being confronted with highly organised, peaceful civilians, people who are glueing themselves to official buildings and pavements in key thoroughfares.\n\nThis kind of protest is not going to stop overnight, so what should be the reaction of our elected leaders?\n\nMocking protestors, like Boris has done, won\u2019t work. One critic said that the movement will only be successful if it appeals to middle England.\n\nBut look past the fancy dress and whacky slogans, and listen to the people holding placards. They are resoundingly middle class. Many are protesting for the first time.\n\nThe section of society that cares about animals, loves watching the BBC\u2019s David Attenborough and thinks he should be running Britain, and carefully recycles everything in the correct containers - are all sympathetic to the climate change cause.\n\nOnly blinkered buffoons like Boris could pretend otherwise.\n\nArrests of Extinction Rebellion demonstrators takes place in Abingdon Street, outside the Palace of Westminster\n\nThe government is out of step with public opinion. We are ready for stricter legislation. We would pay an airport tax.\n\nWe want to ban lorries in city centres during the day. We can see how the air quality in our towns is appalling - and that it\u2019s all down to the fumes from cars.\n\nThis week, our \u2018environmentally-friendly\u2019 government over-ruled planning inspectors and green-lit a new gas power plant at Drax, in spite of experts voicing concerns about it\u2019s impact on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe government has already cancelled the carbon capture equipment at Drax, citing cost.\n\nYou can mock the women wearing scary masks and spraying blood all over government offices. And yes, there\u2019s a lack of joined-up thinking on the part of protestors who filed off to McDonalds for their lunch.\n\nYes, not everyone has banned unnecessary consumption, young people haven\u2019t stopped buying trainers and travelling by car. Even so, there\u2019s much to admire about the climate change protestors.\n\nI suggest Boris gets out of his official car and tries listening for once.", "description": "JANET STREET-PORTER: The climate change protestors clogging up the streets of central London are annoying, I agree, but dismiss them at your peril.", "authors": ["Janet Street-Porter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19460602-0-image-a-32_1570566082738.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
