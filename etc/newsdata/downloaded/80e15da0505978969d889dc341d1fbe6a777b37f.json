Jody said Ann noticed Freya stuff half a strawberry, bought as a treat, into her mouth.\n\n\u201cShe immediately began to choke and her face was turning red,\u201d said Jody.\n\n\u201cI picked her out of her buggy and patted her on her back but it made no difference. I did it again and I could see she was starting to panic.\n\n\u201cMy mum took her and tried to get it out and it didn\u2019t work so we took her jacket off and tried again but it still wasn\u2019t coming out.\u201d\n\nBy now Freya had turned purple and her eyes were beginning to bulge.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re supposed to do in that situation went right out my head because I was panicking so much but that was when this guy strolled over, as calm as anything with his hands in his pockets, and said \u2018you have to keep the baby upside-down\u2019,\u201d said Jody.\n\n\u201cHe took her, tilted her right upside down and started hitting her harder than we had been.\n\n(Image: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\n\u201cHe carried on with it and the biggest part of the strawberry popped out and she was completely fine.\u201d\n\nJody managed a quick thank-you but was shaking so much with emotion that she had to sit down and was given a cup of tea. By the time she turned back, the man had returned to his family and she was unable to speak to him.\n\n\u201cHe told my mum his own daughter had choked on a pea pod when she was young and he took a children\u2019s first aid course,\u201d she said.", "description": "The man came to the aide of 21-month-old Freya Fernie as she began to choke on a strawberry and her face turned purple", "authors": ["John Jeffay", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Cascadenews.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659180.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Cascade_Freya_King_Saved_from_Choking_Cardenden002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
