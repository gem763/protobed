This week, a federal judge approved the motion to convert the filing from a reorganization to a chapter 7 liquidation.\n\nBCause Mining was ordered to liquidate its assets, shut down its operations and lay off its 27 full-time and four part-time workers.\n\nRecoup $500,000 grant\n\nThe now-defunct mining company received a $500,000 grant in January 2018 from the city of Virginia Beach to expand its operations to a local rented warehouse. BCause had pledged to invest more than $60 million in a massive expansion, which would have made it the largest cryptocurrency mining operation in North America.\n\nVirginia Beach municipal spokeswoman Julie Hill said that the city will now consider filing a claim in bankruptcy court in an attempt to recoup some of the money it paid out to the mining company. The city of Virginia Beach would be considered an unsecured creditor, which means that its claim will only be addressed once all the secured claims are dealt with.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s blockchain voting app hacked by student?\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating whether a student at the University of Michigan attempted to hack the West Virginia\u2019s voting app. West Virginia\u2019s Secretary of State, Mac Warner, alerted the FBI during an unsuccessful attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Voatz voting app and said that the activity of the attempt came from IP addresses linked to the University of Michigan.", "description": "BCause Mining, a Bitcoin mining operation in the city of Virginia Beach was ordered to liquidate its assets and shut down its operations", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy80MjU5ZGEwNDgwYzhhZjQ0YjFlMGQzNzEwN2QxNGEwNC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
