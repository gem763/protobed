strategy.\n\n\u201cAviation is likely to be the largest emitting sector in the UK by 2050, even with strong progress on technology and limiting demand,\u201d said the CCC.\n\n\u201cAviation also has climate warming effects beyond CO2, which it will be important to monitor and consider within future policies.\u201d\n\nOther organisations have welcomed the call for a curb on the rapid expansion of the aviation industry.\n\n\u201cBritish people currently take more international flights than anyone else in the world, but there\u2019s a growing public recognition that this feels out of step with the action we need to take on climate change, and two-thirds of Britons say they support limiting air travel to address the climate crisis,\u201d said Cait Hewitt, deputy director at the Aviation Environment Federation.\n\n\u201cThe Government\u2019s dodged the issue of aviation emissions for too long. With climate targets that are now tougher than ever, it\u2019s time for them to look again at plans for new runways, bigger airports and more flights, and focus instead on delivering an effective plan to make the aviation sector accountable for its emissions.\u201d\n\nSchemes to create more sustainable and less damaging aviation fuel include British Airways\u2019 plan to create Europe\u2019s first commercial scale waste-to-fuels plant.\n\nIn partnership with Shell and Velocys, the airline is aiming to convert household and commercial waste into cleaner burning jet fuel, which will deliver a net CO2 saving of around 70 per cent for every tonne of conventional fuel it displaces.", "description": "The government has been told it needs to halve flight growth plans if it wants to hit its target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
