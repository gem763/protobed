Qesem Cave is located on the western slopes of the Samaria Hills, about 12 km east of Tel Aviv, Israel\n\nTo see whether residents of the cave sometimes saved marrow for later, the scientists analysed cut marks on the long bones of the hands and feet \u2013 metapodials \u2013 from the remains of 81,898 animals \u2014 mostly fallow deer \u2014 found at the site.\n\nFor comparison, the researchers monitored changes in red deer marrow preservation and processing marks over a period of nine weeks.\n\nBecause dry flesh is more attached to the bone, greater effort is required to remove it, leaving behind a distinct pattern of marks.\n\nIn the experimental set, short incisions and sawing marks predominated when the skin was removed after two or more weeks.\n\nThe number of marks increased from the fourth week onward, according to the study published in Science Advances.\n\nResearchers say 80% of bones from the Qesem Cave had precisely these marks.\n\nMagnified examples of the marks found on the bones which suggest the meat and marrow was removed while it was dry and stuck to the bone\n\nProfessor Jordi Rosell of Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Spain, said: 'Prehistoric humans brought to the cave selected body parts of the hunted animal carcasses.\n\n'The most common prey was fallow deer, and limbs and skulls were brought to the cave while the rest of the carcass was stripped of meat and fat at the hunting scene and left there.\n\n'We found that the deer leg bones, specifically the metapodials, exhibited unique chopping marks on the shafts, which are not characteristic of the marks left from stripping fresh skin to fracture the bone and extract the marrow.'\n\nThe researchers suggest the deer bones were kept at the cave covered in skin to facilitate the preservation of marrow for consumption in time of need.\n\nAccording to the research, this is the earliest evidence in the world of food preservation and delayed consumption of food.\n\nDry flesh is more attached to the bone so removing it can leaving behind a distinct pattern of marks - which is how researchers have\n\nThe discovery debunked the theory that the Paleolithic people were hunter gatherers who lived hand-to-mouth (the Stone Age version of farm-to-table), consuming whatever they caught that day and enduring long periods of hunger when food sources were scarce.\n\nAs marrow is largely fat with a bit of protein the food source would have been crucial to the Palaeolithic humans' nutrition.\n\nWith a high calorific value the food would have been of 'special significance' to the communities who would have been almost exclusively dependent on animal products with little or no source of carbohydrates.\n\nAnother example of populations with scarce food supplies storing bones can be seen in Nunamiut Eskimo communities where archaeologist Lewis Binford discovered bones were often stored throughout the winter months to be boiled in large batches for grease and marrow consumption.\n\nFrom a microbiological perspective, preserving marrow could be relatively safe compared to meat because the bone casing offers protection from microbes.\n\nHowever bacteria in the circulatory system of the animal could have entered the bone through the nutrient artery.\n\nThe research by R.
