To this end, it has announced that it will divest its New Mexico property for $925 million to a unit of Spur Energy Partners LLC.\n\nIn line with this, the company has plans to initiate a $1.5-billion stock repurchase program. This will be partly backed by the divestiture of the New Mexico asset wherein 40% of the proceeds will be used for the buyback program and the remaining will be utilized in repaying the debts.\n\nCurrently, the Continental Shelf asset produces 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (bpd) at 100,000 gross acres adjoining Concho Resources\u2019 operation in the Delaware Basin. Notwithstanding the New Mexico asset sell-off, this Midland-based E&P company intends to continue with its various development projects in southeastern New Mexico for helping its employees.\n\nThe oil-levered producer in the Permian Basin focuses on selling its non-core assets to enhance its portfolio value. Further, it aims to streamline its cost structure leading to cost-efficient growth. Additionally, Concho Resources concentrates on attaining its debt-reduction target and improve returns to its shareholders.\n\nSo selling this non-core Shelf asset will help Concho Resources save its cash operating costs and inch closer to its 2020 target expense of $9 per barrel of oil equivalent (bpd) compared with the current figure of $9.83 bpd. Moreover, the stock repurchase program shows Concho Resources\u2019 strong belief in its strategy. Tim Leach, chairman and CEO, Concho Resources, feels that this venture is a vindication of the company\u2019s scheme to generate solid cash flow along with sustainable oil production.\n\nThe transaction is contingent on pending approvals and is estimated to complete during November 2019.\n\nConcho Resources Inc.
