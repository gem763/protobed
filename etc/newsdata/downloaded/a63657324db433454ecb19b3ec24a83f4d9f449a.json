But when you learn the story behind the movie, you\u2019ll realize that it took a superhuman effort to bring it to life. As conceived and executed by the Oscar-winning director of American Beauty and his crew, including legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins, 1917 unfolds over the course of two hours in real time and in a single continuous shot. If Mendes is being honest, there are hidden cuts throughout the movie. But if he\u2019s done his job right \u2014 and based on the footage we\u2019ve seen so far, he definitely has \u2014 moviegoers will emerge from the theater believing they saw the entire story play out in one long take. \u201cIt said it on the front page of the script,\u201d Mendes told an audience of press and fans before the new trailer premiered. \u201cThis movie was written and designed to be filmed in one continuous shot.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the director wants the audiences to be as equally entranced by the characters as they are by the filmmaking. And the new trailer (watch above) does provide more details about the narrative that Mendes and his co-writer, Krysty Wilson-Cairns, conceived. Loosely based on real events, the movie takes place on a single day in 1917 when British troops nearly walked into a German ambush on the Western Front. In the film, two soldiers \u2014 Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) \u2014 are dispatched across enemy lines to warn a battalion of their brethren of the Germans\u2019 plans. Colin Firth plays the officer who gives them their marching orders, and Benedict Cumberbatch plays a grizzled colonel who has clearly seen more than his fair share of wartime horrors.\n\nView photos Sam Mendes on the set of his single-take World War I movie '1917' (Photo: Francois Duhamel / Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures) More\n\nPrior to the release of the new 1917 trailer at NYCC, Yahoo Entertainment spoke with Mendes about directing his first war movie, what it feels like to potentially be back in the Oscar race two decades after American Beauty and the secret Apocalypse Now homage people should watch out for.\n\nYahoo Entertainment: Based on the concept behind 1917, I feel like my first question has to be: what\u2019s your favorite single-take sequence?\n\nSam Mendes: It\u2019s a good question! I\u2019ll probably get asked that a lot. I should think of more.\n\nI just re-watched The Player recently. That opening eight-minute tracking shot is still fantastic.\n\nThat\u2019s a great one. The way it goes in and out of the studio offices? I love it. I also love the opening of Boogie Nights. Touch of Evil is an obvious one \u2014 they talk about it in The Player! Even though it\u2019s not a long take, I love the tracking shot behind the tricycle in The Shining. It only lasts 30 seconds, but it\u2019s so f****g tense. You\u2019re just like, \u201cWhy am I absolutely terrified and nothing is happening?\u201d [Laughs] That\u2019s what it\u2019s like to be in the hands of a master. The most famous one is probably the Goodfellas shot. That\u2019s Scorsese at his most magnificently effortless. You\u2019re so aware of the filmmaking, because there\u2019s really nothing else going on in that shot except the environments, one after the other. You\u2019ve just reminded me of the high bar we have to clear. Thanks for that!\n\nWell, you\u2019ve got to know what to compare yourself to.\n\nExactly, you\u2019ve got to know what you\u2019re not good enough to reach. [Laughs]\n\nIn your own work, the opening sequence of Spectre features a lengthy single take, with James Bond pursuing a target across rooftops in Mexico City.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a seven or eight minute shot. At one point, I was going to do the whole sequence in one shot, and then it reached the point where it just didn\u2019t want to be that anymore for the story. But that was helpful, because it made me aware that if you\u2019re going to do something like that for the whole length of a movie, it has to be baked into the very DNA of the whole thing. It has to be part of the fabric of the story from the beginning. You can\u2019t impose it \u2014 and that was the case with 1917.", "description": "Oscar-winning filmmaker explains how he conceived his buzzy new war movie as one, continuous shot over two hours, how it unveils the human condition \u2014 and the surprising influence of \"Apocalypse Now.\"", "authors": ["Ethan Alter", "Senior Writer", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6oQErH7MbguRh5lYOosWjw--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/73579590-e651-11e9-b9fe-8e88f59d44cc", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
