However, union officials maintain that such an offer still falls short in terms of the goals set forth by the Chicago teachers union, as teachers seek higher wages and increase in school funding.\n\n\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been fighting and fighting for, and we finally did see some proposals,\u201d CPS school social worker Emily Penn told the Chicago Tribune. \u201cWe\u2019re relieved the district actually put it in writing... It is not enough. Hopefully, we can continue to bargain in good faith.\u201d\n\nAs a part of the negotiating team, Penn and other Chicago teachers union representatives met with city officials on the other side of the bargaining table at Malcolm X College on Friday, telling the press afterwards that a CPS lawyer had asked union officials to focus more on the negotiations than on rallies and picket line strikes.\n\nThat comment enraged the teachers union Vice President Stacy Davis Gates, who subsequently responded that \u201crich white men tell black women with children in the Chicago Public Schools what to do all the time.\"\n\nGates added that her name was misspelled in the note from a CPS attorney, who claimed the city \u201ccannot afford to have another three to four recess in negotiations while both of you are gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is misspelled. So pay attention to what\u2019s being said here,\" Davis Gates told the Tribune. \u201c... His name is spelled right. There\u2019s something to this. The city has a legacy, a culture, of putting black women in the position where life is harder, where they have to be silenced, to take the backseat, and this is an element of it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot alongside Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson released a statement on Friday afternoon, saying their counterproposals regarding classroom sizes and school staffing demonstrate that they are \u201cworking to the core issues that CTU has said are central to reaching an agreement \u2014 in writing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged that today\u2019s negotiations were productive and yielded real movement on a number of key issues,\u201d their joint statement read.\n\nBut just hours before the release of their statement, the mayor had publicly stated that the school district\u2019s offer would not include any more financial backing.\n\n\u201cThe fact is there is no more money,\u201d Lightfoot said tersely. \u201cPeriod.\u201d\n\nDuring a break in negotiations on Thursday, union officials led a massive rally in downtown Chicago, with a public relations battle between the two sides ignited in the process.\n\nContract discussions paused again on Friday after the union held yet another protest, which drew huge crowds of teachers and Chicago public school staff members in front of City Hall, union Vice President Davis Gates remained at the negotiating table, according to the Chicago Tribune, CTU President James Sharkey announced that bargaining efforts \u201chave been positive\u201d thus far, but admitted that they are \u201cnot there yet\u201d regarding a suitable contract agreement.\n\nNegotiators on behalf of the city urged union leaders to consider starting 10-hour daily negotiating sessions after expressing concerns that the strike could extend into next week.\n\nMayor Lightfoot has since said \u201cthe ball is very much in their court\u2026 we didn\u2019t leave the table,\u201d while claiming the two sides could reach a deal \u201cin a matter of days.\u201d\n\nUnion official Stacey Davis Gates didn\u2019t share the mayor\u2019s optimism, however, and placed the blame of the teachers strike squarely on Lightfoot\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\"The mayor is in control of every single resource in this city,\u201d Davis Gates said. \u201cThe fact that we can\u2019t conclude (a contract deal) is about her refusal to do so.... This is a strong mayor city. She controls transportation, she controls public safety, she controls housing, she controls economic development, she controls public education. Certainly a mayor who has that much control can figure out how to land a contract that improves the lives of students in Chicago Public Schools. The urgency must lie in their ability to put those things together.\u201d\n\nUnion leaders had initially set out their framework for a contract back in January. Contract talks are expected to resume again on Saturday.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The Chicago teachers union is on its second day of striking after contract negotiations with city officials broke down on Friday.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/chicago-teacher-strike-Getty-001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
