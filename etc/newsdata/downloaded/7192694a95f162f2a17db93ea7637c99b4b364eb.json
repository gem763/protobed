Volker resigned soon after the complaint was made public last week.\n\nGOP DEMANDS \u2018EQUAL PLAYING FIELD\u2019 AHEAD OF FORMER UKRAINE ENVOY VOLKER\u2019S SCHEDULED TESTIMONY\n\nTalking to reporters outside the hearing, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, praised Volker as \"unbelievably knowledgeable about what was going on in Ukraine\" and called him a \"true professional in our diplomatic corps.\"\n\n\"But not one thing he said comports with any of the Democrats' impeachment narrative,\" he added. \"Not one thing.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told reporters Thursday afternoon that he would not yet comment on Volker's testimony, but offered some words of criticism for Trump. Schiff claimed that by \"suggesting, urging a foreign country to interfere in our presidential election,\" Trump showed that after two years of Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, \"he feels he can do anything with impunity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, new encrypted text messages obtained by Fox News show Volker and other U.S. officials battling internally last month over whether Trump was engaged in a \"quid pro quo\" with Ukraine as he pressed for the country to look into the Biden family, while holding back U.S. aid. The texts with Volker, U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine Bill Taylor indicate that the nature of a potential arrangement between the U.S. and Ukraine was a matter of dispute.\n\n\"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Taylor said in a text exchange.\n\nSondland responded by saying that was not what was happening. \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\"\n\nBoth men then agreed to cease discussing the matter over text, noting that phone calls with the appropriate officials would be preferable.\n\nDemocrats are accusing Trump of threatening to withhold military aid as leverage to obtain Ukraine's assistance in an investigation into the Biden family. Trump adamantly denies any quid pro quo.\n\nA White House memo released last week contains the substance of the July phone call showing that Trump asked Zelensky to assist Rudy Giuliani, who was investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. In particular, Giuliani has raised questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, as well as the former vice president's successful effort to have a prosecutor -- who had been looking into the company -- fired. The Bidens have vehemently denied wrongdoing, with allies maintaining the intervention had to do with corruption concerns.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower complaint, Volker met with Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials in Kiev the day after the phone call. The complaint alleges that, according to \u201cvarious U.S. officials,\u201d Volker and Sondland advised Ukraine how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s request.\n\nThe State Department said Volker has confirmed that he put a Zelensky adviser in contact with Giuliani, at the Ukraine adviser's request, and Giuliani has said he was in frequent contact with Volker.\n\nOther text messages between Volker and Giuliani provided to Fox News showed that the two had been in touch since at least May 2019, with a June 19 text message from Volker discussing connecting Giuliani with top Zelensky adviser Andrey Yermak. Giuliani and Yermak went on to meet in Madrid on Aug. 2. The text messages also showed that Volker followed up with Giuliani after Trump and Zelensky's call.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelensky have insisted that Trump did not pressure Zelensky into doing anything.\n\nThe Associated Press reported on Wednesday that Volker met last year with a top official from the same Ukrainian energy firm that paid Hunter Biden to serve on its board. The meeting occurred even as Giuliani pressed Ukraine's government to investigate the company and the Bidens' involvement with it.\n\nVolker\u2019s interview with the House Intelligence Committee is part of the Democrats\u2019 ongoing impeachment-related investigation of Trump. House Republicans were up in arms when Schiff said that GOP members of the Foreign Affairs Committee would not be permitted to ask questions or have equal representation during the session.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT ON TRUMP UKRAINE CALL: READ THE DOCUMENT\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the Foreign Affairs Committee\u2019s ranking member, argued in a letter Wednesday that because the full House has not voted to approve an impeachment inquiry, only his committee has the authority to conduct an investigation of this nature.\n\n\u201cIntelligence Chairman Adam Schiff lacks the jurisdiction to investigate the Department of State\u2019s conduct of United States foreign policy toward Ukraine. That prerogative belongs to our Members,\u201d McCaul said in his letter to Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y.\n\nFox News learned Thursday that Democrats made concessions and that there is now equal representation from counsels for both parties at the session. Still, while representatives from the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight Committees are present, only the Intelligence Committee is permitted to ask questions.\n\nAfter the New York Times reported that the whistleblower sought guidance from the Intelligence Committee about how to proceed prior to filing the complaint, Trump accused Schiff of helping write the complaint himself. A spokesman for Schiff and the committee said in a statement, \u201cAt no point did the Committee review or receive the complaint in advance,\u201d and the whistleblower\u2019s attorney Mark Zaid told Fox News that neither the whistleblower nor their legal team \u201chas ever met or spoken with Congressman Schiff about this matter.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cThere was no contact between the legal team and Congress until nearly a month after the whistleblower complaint was submitted to the Intelligence Community\u2019s Inspector General,\u201d Zaid said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Danielle Wallace, Brooke Singman, Catherin Herridge, Chad Pergram, John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former U.S. envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker appeared on Capitol Hill Thursday as\u00a0one of the first\u00a0witnesses to go before a congressional body amid the impeachment probe triggered by the whistleblower complaint\u00a0on President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Volker720.jpg"}
