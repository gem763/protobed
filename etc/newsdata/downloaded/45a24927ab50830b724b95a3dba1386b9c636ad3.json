So, sorry, I don't think the plesiosaur idea holds up based on the data that we have obtained.\"\n\nHe added: \"So there's no shark DNA in Loch Ness based on our sampling. There is also no catfish DNA in Loch Ness based on our sampling. We can't find any evidence of sturgeon either,\n\n\"There is a very significant amount of eel DNA. Eels are very plentiful in Loch Ness, with eel DNA found at pretty much every location sampled - there are a lot of them. So - are they giant eels?\n\n\"Well, our data doesn't reveal their size, but the sheer quantity of the material says that we can't discount the possibility that there may be giant eels in Loch Ness. Therefore we can't discount the possibility that what people see and believe is the Loch Ness Monster might be a giant eel.\"\n\nHow Nessie came to grip the public imagination\n\nImage copyright AF archive/Alamy Image caption Nessie made an appearance in the 1969 film The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\n\nThe Loch Ness Monster is one of Scotland's oldest and most enduring myths. It inspires books, TV shows and films, and sustains a major tourism industry around its home.\n\nThe story of the monster can be traced back 1,500 years when Irish missionary St Columba is said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD.\n\nLater, in the 1930s, The Inverness Courier reported the first modern sighting of Nessie.\n\nIn 1933, the newspaper's Fort Augustus correspondent, Alec Campbell, reported a sighting by Aldie Mackay of what she believed to be Nessie.\n\nMr Campbell's report described a whale-like creature and the loch's water \"cascading and churning\".\n\nThe editor at the time, Evan Barron, suggested the beast be described as a \"monster\", kick starting the modern myth of the Loch Ness Monster.\n\nIn 1934, highly respected British surgeon, Colonel Robert Wilson, claimed he took a photograph of the monster while driving along the northern shore of Loch Ness.\n\nIt was later revealed to be a toy submarine fitted with a sea-serpent head.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Swimming circus elephants have been offered up as an explanation for Nessie\n\nExplanations for the monster offered in the past include it being swimming circus elephants.\n\nIn his research of Nessie, Glasgow-based palaeontologist Neil Clark found fairs and circuses were a common occurrence in the Inverness area, particularly from the early 1930s.\n\nHe said elephants may have been allowed to swim in the loch while the travelling carnivals stopped to give the animals a rest.\n\nAnother theory is that large fallen branches floating in the loch are the cause of monster sightings.\n\nSteve Feltham, who is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records for the longest continuous monster hunting vigil of Loch Ness, is not convinced the scientists have yet identified the creature behind the sightings.\n\nMr Feltham, who made childhood visits to the Highlands and moved from Dorset almost 30 years ago to look for Nessie, said he had seen seals in Loch Ness.\n\nHe added: \"A 12-year-old boy could tell you there are eels in Loch Ness. I caught eels in the loch when I was a 12-year-old boy.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption On average about 10 sightings of unexplained creatures on Loch Ness are received a year\n\nGary Campbell, keeper of a register of Nessie sightings, receives on average 10 reports a year of something unexplained being spotted in the loch's waters.\n\nHe welcomed the latest research and hoped more scientists will examine what lives in Loch Ness.\n\nMr Campbell said tourism that has developed around the story of the monster would be unaffected by the new study. He said: \"The Loch Ness Monster has evolved into a world-wide icon.\"", "description": "A DNA study rules out suggestions that \"Nessie\" is a prehistoric reptile or a shark.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/50F2/production/_108622702_surgeonsphoto.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
