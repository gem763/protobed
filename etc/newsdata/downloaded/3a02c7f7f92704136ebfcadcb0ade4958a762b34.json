A new corporate moniker would help send such a signal to regulators and consumers.\n\nPhilip Morris rebranded itself as Altria in 2003, back when it still owned Kraft Foods. The company said the change better reflected the diversity of its portfolio beyond tobacco. It announced a roughly eight-week ad campaign in print, TV, the web and direct mail to spread the word.\n\nCritics called the move a ploy to downplay tobacco\u2019s continued importance at the company. \u201cChanging the name always struck me as you were being a coward about who you really were,\u201d said Robert Passikoff, founder and president of marketing firm Brand Keys Inc.\n\nPhilip Morris and Altria representatives declined to comment beyond the companies\u2019 statements this week announcing discussions to merge.\n\nThe Philip Morris name has far higher recognition in the U.S., at 76% in surveys by research technology company Morning Consult, than Altria, at 24%. And it is well established around the world.\n\nBut it also has far higher negative perception in the U.S.: 31% of consumers have an unfavorable opinion of Philip Morris, compared with 4% for Altria, Morning Consult said.\n\nIf the companies are strongly concerned about perceptions of the Philip Morris name, they should conduct new research, said Aaron Hall, group director in the naming practice at brand-consulting firm Siegel+Gale. \u201cGo find out how several thousand people feel about the brand,\u201d he said.\n\nThese might seem like academic questions, given that consumers aren\u2019t asked to buy products actually called Altria or Philip Morris. But corporate monikers are becoming more important and consumers are becoming more engaged and informed on company practices, according to Jenn Szekely, managing partner for the U.S. at branding firm Coley Porter Bell.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world, people care about the companies behind the products they buy,\u201d Ms. Szekely said.\n\nAnd parent companies have sought the spotlight more often in recent years, with multibrand giants such as Procter & Gamble and Unilever promoting themselves by name this decade in ad campaigns during the Olympics and elsewhere.\n\nAltria and Philip Morris International split in 2008 partly to insulate operations abroad from legal risk over tobacco in the U.S. The companies hold the same portfolio of cigarettes but divvy up sales between the U.S. and the rest of the world. They are considering getting back together as the legal troubles have abated and cigarette sales slow.\n\nThough the companies described their potential deal as a merger of equals, The Wall Street Journal reported that the two sides are discussing a deal in which Philip Morris would control around 59% of the company. Other elements, such as management positions and board seats, are expected to be more evenly split. Letting Altria\u2019s name survive could give the appearance of relatively equal footing, similar to how United Technologies Corp. and the smaller Raytheon Co. plan to lead with Raytheon\u2019s name once combined.\n\nThere\u2019s still the question of the tobacco firms\u2019 business strategy ahead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to come down to what are they trying to do with this combined company, and can either of the existing brands convey that?\u201d said Daniel Binns, chief executive officer at the New York office of the global brand-consulting firm Interbrand.\n\nIf executives want to signal aspirations to move beyond cigarettes, perhaps into areas such as e-cigarettes or even cannabis, a brand-new name might help cement that with the public. \u201cWe often say your name is your strategy in its shortest form,\u201d Mr. Binns said.\n\nWrite to Nat Ives at nat.ives@wsj.com and Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com", "description": "As Marlboro makers Philip Morris International and Altria Group pursue talks to merge, executives are beginning to wonder what to call the entity that would result.", "authors": ["Nat Ives", "Cara Lombardo", "Nat.Ives Wsj.Com", "Cara.Lombardo Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102118/social"}
