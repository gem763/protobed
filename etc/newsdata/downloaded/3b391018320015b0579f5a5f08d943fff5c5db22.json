It wasn\u2019t until I was definitely sure that I decided to come out.\n\n\u2018It got to the stage where I had to tell people about it, it wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do but the support I have had from my family and friends has been amazing.\n\n\u2018I think the reason I found it so scary is that because I am a farmer, I am last in line to carry on the Bushby name and so it\u2019s a lot of pressure on me.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe 35-year-old, who has been single for 18 months, is looking for a male partner to share his agricultural life with, although David admitted that he struggled to get back into the dating game after his seven year relationship ended abruptly.\n\nHe added: \u2018I was in a relationship for seven years and one day he just left me, I got home to a note on the door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have found it difficult to adjust to single life and get back in the dating scene, plus I live right on the coast so it\u2019s so hard to meet someone.\n\nDavid Bushby goes on three dates to decide who he wants to be with (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018The population is really low and finding someone who is suitable is a challenge. I went on a dating app and I found myself extending the distance and it just got ridiculous \u2013 and that\u2019s when I applied for the show.\n\n\u2018I honestly didn\u2019t think I would find anyone on the show, but it was a confidence thing and to make me see there are people out there and I\u2019m not on my own.\u2019\n\nFarming wasn\u2019t always the life for David as he attended Bristol University where he studied a degree in Geography.\n\nDavid said he didn\u2019t \u2018come out\u2019 to his parents until he was 28-years-old (Picture: BBC)\n\nAlthough, after moving to Nottingham for two years he soon realised the hustle and bustle wasn\u2019t for him so he retreated back to his parent\u2019s farm \u2013 where he has been for the past 11 years.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s show will follow David on his three dates with his potential suitors, Michael, Sal and Luke.\n\nDavid said: \u2018It was really great having them come to the farm but it was a bit weird as they all stayed in my house and I went to stay with my parents.\n\n\u2018They were all completely different, one was scared of animals, another came from central London and the other one has horses so he had a bit of a agricultural background.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They got to milk the cows, have a tour of the farm and then I got to go on a date with each of them which was nice. We went rowing, to the pub and the beach.\u2019\n\nDavid Bushy said he struggled to date after his relationship ended (Picture: BBC)\n\nAfter his dates, the dairy farmer admitted he got emotional trying to whittle it down to one person.\n\n\u2018My friends helped me make the decision as they also got to meet each of them,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018It was such a tough decision as I spent such little time with them and during that time I wanted to be the best version of myself, towards the end it got draining.\n\n\u2018I found that I did click with two of my dates, and tonight you will see how I get upset in my decision making so I am not sure how it\u2019s going to look on camera.\n\n\u2018Next week you will get to see who I pick, but the whole experience was so much fun, I had the time of my life.\u2019\n\nLove In The Countryside airs tonight at 9pm on BBC Two.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
