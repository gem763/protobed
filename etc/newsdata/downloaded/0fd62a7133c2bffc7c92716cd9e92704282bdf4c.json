Juncker said \u201cthe risk of no deal is palpable\u201d, but added an agreement was desirable and still possible.\n\nGesturing towards Brexit party MEPs, Juncker joked that \u201cthese are my best friends\u201d. In another one-liner about the suspension of parliament for an unprecedented five weeks, Juncker said tartly: \u201cThis house is open and in action and not prorogued.\u201d\n\nJuncker also announced that Michel Barnier, the chief Brexit negotiator, would be involved in talks with the British, a sign that discussions would intensify and move up to the political level.\n\nSpeaking after Juncker, Barnier said he and his team were \u201copen to any UK proposal\u201d and were \u201cwilling to work day and night towards progress\u201d. But his intervention underscored the enormous gap between the two sides in finding an alternative to the Irish backstop, the fallback plan intended to protect the Irish peace process and the EU single market.\n\nThe UK government has indicated it is ready to accept an all-Ireland food and agricultural zone to avoid the need for many checks. But Barnier said specific guarantees were needed in other areas, including customs, so the EU could control products arriving in the single market.\n\nThe two men were speaking as MEPs prepare to vote on a resolution insisting that any Brexit deal includes the Irish backstop.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, who drafted that text, gave an impassioned speech that lacerated the British government\u2019s record on citizens\u2019 rights.\n\nIn a withering joke, Verhofstadt said that \u201cinstead of playing the angry Hulk\u201d, Johnson should play \u201cthe caring nanny of the film of Mrs Doubtfire\u201d \u2013 to better protect 4.5 million citizens facing the huge uncertainty of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nPicking up on one key concern for the EU, Verhofstadt said the European parliament would never accept an agreement that would give the UK \u201call the advantages of free trade\u201d, without aligning with European standards on social rights, environment and health.\n\n\u201cWe are not stupid and we will not kill our own companies,\u201d he said to cheers and boos. \u201cWe will defend our own economy and we\u2019ll never accept Singapore by the North Sea.\u201d\n\nVerhofstadt\u2019s crowd-pleasing lines were cheered by many MEPs, including British remainers. While the chamber was at best one-quarter full, the UK\u2019s 73 MEPs were well-represented, with the Brexit divide on full display.\n\nSpeaking from the back of the room, Farage claimed Barnier\u2019s objective had always been \u201ckeeping us trapped inside\u201d, fearing that the UK \u201cbreaks out of the single market and we become much wealthier outside the European Union\u201d. Barnier has said consistently he respects the UK decision to leave.\n\nThe debate became increasingly rowdy and bad-tempered, as Brexit party MEPs heckled their colleagues, laughed or shouted \u201crubbish\u201d when they heard statements they disliked.\n\nIn an attempt to quieten one Brexit party MEP, the European parliament vice-president, Mairead McGuinness, who was chairing the meeting, told them: \u201cBe quiet, I am in control.\u201d", "description": "European commission president tells MEPs risk of no-deal Brexit is \u2018palpable\u2019", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f2dad1d5869e8157b361af9a4eefd18bc087bb7/0_49_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04a356e7b63ce20865ab977df973a9d7", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
