All Sugarpova candies are made from natural, non-GMO ingredients and can be found in stores across the country.\n\n\u201cI recognized that tennis would not last forever, and I think as you have this one thing going on in your life and this one career path it's as if you're never going to make shifts and turns and I recognized at that time that, wow, I don't know if I'm going to ever come back from the shoulder injury and at the time it was like I want to take all the experience that I've had in business and I want to apply it to Sugarpova,\u201d Sharapova said.\n\nAfter years of partnering with brands and being the face of various advertising campaigns, Sharapova was ready to take what she had learned from those experiences and apply them.\n\n\u201cI actually didn't say I think I can do this. It was more like I think I want to be a little more competitive with this,\u201d Sharapova said about starting Sugarpova. \u201cI want to be the one that's making more decisions, better decisions that can maybe benefit me in the long run.\u201d\n\nShe began creating the line's bags and logo that is seen around the world today.\n\nIn the interview, Sharapova also touched on failing a drug test because of a medication she had been taking for health reasons, causing her to be banned from tennis for 15 months.\n\n\u201cIt was such an interesting time in my career because it's also a time that I was considering maybe stepping down from the sport and thinking a little bit about family and business and it kind of prolonged my career in a way of when I did get back I viewed the sport in a very different way,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cIt was a blessing and opened my eyes to what I had achieved and the amount of people that respected what I did.\u201d\n\nWhile taking some time off to re-evaluate her future, Sharapova focused on Sugarpova and studied management and leadership at Harvard to gain business skills.\n\n\u201cI worked on Sugarpova consistently,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cI was investing in a few different businesses so I had time and then I got to spend the holidays at home which was such a treat for me.\u201d\n\nSharapova\u2019s tennis career is still going strong, and she continues to push forward in the world of entrepreneurship, launching Sugarpova in stores across the globe and serving as a guest judge on season 11 of \u201cShark Tank.\"\n\n\u201cIn sports we can be seen as heroic, but at the end of the day we're also very open to being vulnerable and entrepreneurship should be the same way, there\u2019s no reason to hide the tough moments,\" she said. \"I think that's part of the scars that help you grow.\u201d\n\nHear more from Maria Sharapova on episode #134 of \u201cNo Limits with Rebecca Jarvis.\u201d", "description": "ABC News' Rebecca Jarvis sat down with tennis champion and CEO of Sugarpova Maria Sharapova for", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/NoLimitsMariaSharapovarec_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
