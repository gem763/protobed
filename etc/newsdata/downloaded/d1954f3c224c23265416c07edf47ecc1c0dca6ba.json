Elijah Cummings", "language": "en", "text": "Hopefuls have until Nov. 20 to declare their candidacy. The primary election will be Feb. 4 and a general election will be held April 28 \u2014 the same day voters will head to polls to nominate candidates for the 2020 election.\n\nAD\n\nHolding two elections on that date means voters will pick someone to finish the remainder of Cummings\u2019s term at the same time they nominate a primary candidate for the next term. In the heavily Democratic district, which includes roughly half of Baltimore City and parts of suburban Howard and Baltimore counties, the Democratic nominee is expected to be favored in both contests.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working out how it would appear on the ballot,\u201d said Jared DeMarinis, director of candidacy and campaign finance for the Maryland State Board of Elections.\n\nThe scenario means primary voters could nominate one candidate in February to compete for a partial term and nominate a different one in April to compete for a two-year term beginning in January 2021.\n\nAD\n\nMark Gosnell, a Baltimore-area pulmonologist, has announced he intends to run.\n\nAt least nine other Democrats are considering candidacies, including Cummings\u2019s widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, and both halves of the politically connected Mosby couple \u2014 Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marylin Mosby and Del. Nick Mosby (Baltimore City), who are close friends of the Cummingses.\n\nOther possible candidates include former Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake; Kweisi Mfume, the former head of the NAACP who held Cummings\u2019s seat for a decade; longtime state Del. Talmadge Branch (Baltimore City), the majority whip of the House of Delegates; Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (Howard), vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee; and three Baltimore state senators with years of community service: Sens. Jill P. Carter, Antonio L. Hayes and Cory V. McCray.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo serious Republican contenders have emerged yet.\n\nIn a statement, Hogan said he opted to have the special election on the same day as the primary to avoid \u201cthe cost and confusion of multiple and additional election days.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is imperative for the 7th Congressional District to have a strong voice in the House of Representatives,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cFree and fair elections are the very foundation of American democracy, and we encourage the citizens of the 7th District to take part and let their voices be heard.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Hopefuls have until Nov. 20 to declare candidacies for a February primary leading to April general election.", "authors": ["Erin Cox", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_BuBXwR6dDs7TvunsrIRduPntjA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PANCI6XXOMI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
