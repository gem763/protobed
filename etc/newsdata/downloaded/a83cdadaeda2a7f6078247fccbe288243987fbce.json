The short-dated maturity marked its biggest daily drop in two months.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -3.91% fell 6.3 basis points to 1.531%, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -2.35% slipped 4.7 basis points to 2.035%.\n\nSee: The yield curve is steepening, and that\u2019s not good for investors. Here\u2019s why\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Treasurys?\n\nInvestors dived into government paper after data underlined the deteriorating health of the service sector, a large chunk of the U.S. economy. Up to now, industries like finance, technology and construction have been largely insulated from the impact of import tariffs and slowing international trade, but Thursday\u2019s data could suggest cracks are forming in a foundation of the U.S.\u2019s expansion.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management\u2019s non-manufacturing gauge came in at 52.6%, its lowest reading since 2014, well below the 55.3% forecast from economists surveyed by MarketWatch.
