The three senators who demanded answers about Amazon's commitment to consumer safety by September were not satisfied with the answers they received and have floated seeking congressional hearings.\n\nIn their letter, Warren and Wyden said that Amazon had been notified of the risk of a breach a year earlier and should be investigated for unfair business practices.\n\nScott Piper, a cloud security consultant, told Amazon its customer information could be compromised via a server-side request forgery in an email more than a year before the Capital One hack, the Journal reported.\n\nCapital One said in July a suspect who infiltrated its system and exposed millions of people's personal information had been arrested.\n\nWarren is an outspoken critic of the tech industry. For example, she recently ran a series of admittedly fake advertisements on Facebook accusing founder Mark Zuckerberg of endorsing President Trump \u2014 a tactic intended to criticize the social media behemoth's policy of letting politicians make false statements in paid ads.\n\nFOX Business' inquiries to Amazon, the FTC and Warren's office was not immediately returned.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP", "description": "Warren and fellow Democrat Sen.
