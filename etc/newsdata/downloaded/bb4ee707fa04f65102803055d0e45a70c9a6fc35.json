One of Forder's students is Rachel Martins, 10, who is paired with Tyler Lee, also 10, for Mini Blades. \"I started training Barb Underhill in pair when she was about 8 up to and including her first World Championship (when I took a sabbatical to raise my daughters) I am sure if you have seen the videos you will notice that Rachel has a very striking skating resemblance to Barb,\" said Forder. This resemblance can only bode well for the skaters as they work on their Mini Blade skills and program.\n\nTyler Lee (10) and Rachel Martins (10)\n\nForder shared a simple approach to help the skaters become familiar with each other and their respective sports. With time in short supply, \"I started by having Rachel and Tyler demonstrate for each other some aspects of their respective sports that they enjoy the most.

It's in the figure skating rink where Rachel is working on her final Gold level dance test which would give her a second gold medal in the testing system to add to her Gold Skills.\n\nTyler Lee (10) and Rachel Martins (10)\n\nHard work and taking this challenge seriously is what the Mini Blades is all about for the team of Martins and Lee.\n\n\"Observing both athletes working together to achieve a common goal, with the knowledge that the goal was not attainable without each other, brought a whole new dimension to both of their skating, and to each of them as people,\" said Forder.
