Mmm\u2026 tea is a beverage best served hot with a side of potentially poisonous micro and nanoplastics.\n\nThe recent study by researchers at McGill University in Canada showed that tea bags made of plastic can release up to 11.6 billion microplastic and 3.1 billion nanoplastic particles per cup of tea, CBS News reports. It is currently unknown whether the plastics are dangerous to humans, but it doesn\u2019t take an expert to know that you probably shouldn\u2019t drink plastic infused tea.\n\n\u201cWe urgently need to know more about the health impact of microplastics because they are everywhere \u2014 including in our drinking water,\u201d World Health Department Public Health, Environment and Social Determinants of Health director Dr. Maria Neira said.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the American Chemical Society \u201cthese levels were thousands of times higher than those reported previously in other foods.\u201d\n\nSo, on top of swimming in it, and being surrounded by it in every part of your day-to-day life, you now also need to be worried about drinking it in your morning cuppa.\n\nDuring the study, the team removed the leaves from the plastic tea bags to avoid any potential interference. They then boiled the bags at a normal tea-brewing temperature to see how much plastic we\u2019re ingesting when we\u2019re drinking our morning English brekkie.\n\nMost tea bags are made of paper, but are sealed with plastic. However, those *premium* pyramid ones that are apparently designed to infuse your tea better are usually made out of plastic-based mesh. So maybe being a cheapo is better for your health if you\u2019re not a fan of eating plastic for breakfast.\n\nAccording to a separate study from earlier in 2019, we consume 5g of plastic per week, which is like munching on a credit card every week, according to 9 News.\n\nUntil further research is conducted, scientists behind the study warn people to avoid plastic tea bags and opt for alternatives wherever possible.\n\n\u201cTea can be purchased in paper tea bags or as loose-leaf tea, which eliminates the need for this single-use plastic packaging,\u201d researchers told New Scientist.\n\nREAD MORE Sorry, Your Keep Cup Will Not Save The Planet", "description": "A recent study has revealed that your average cup of tea can contain up to 11 billion microplastic and 3 billion nanoplastic particles per cup.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1141013829-1-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
