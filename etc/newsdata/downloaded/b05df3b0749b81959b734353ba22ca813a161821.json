The military broadcast warnings, but the bombers continued their flight.\n\nA military official said, \"Russian planes have strayed into the KADIZ without authorization many times, but it is rare for as many as six of them to enter at the same time and fly all the way up to the West Sea.\"\n\nThe Russian planes ignored the warnings and conducted military maneuvers for almost six hours over the Korean Peninsula, even after the Korean fighter jets were scrambled.\n\nShin Won-shik, a former JCS vice chairman, said, \"Russia seems to be 'testing' Korea to see how it responds after the scrapping of [the bilateral intelligence-sharing pact] with Japan.\"\n\nPark Won-gon at Handong Global University said, \"Russia has sensed that security cooperation between Korea, the U.S. and Japan is weakening, so such provocations will continue.\"\n\nWhen asked for a response, Russia's Defense Ministry said its pilots \"strictly adhered to international regulations.\"\n\nRussian military planes also entered Japan's air defense identification zone several times on Tuesday as Japan was holding an enthronement ceremony for its new emperor.\n\nPundits said those incursions by Russia may have to do with the U.S. decision to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Moscow. The U.S. is apparently considering Korea and Japan as potential locations for the deployment of mid-range missiles.", "description": "Korea Scrambles Fighter Jets as Russian Warplanes Enter Air Defense Zone", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/23/2019102301033_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
