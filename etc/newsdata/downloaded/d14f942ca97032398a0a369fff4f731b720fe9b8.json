\u201cvulnerable\u201d by the IUCN, meaning it is at less threat of extinction than the rest of the species as a whole.\n\nMr Peyerk did not respond to a phone message seeking comment. He is president of Dan\u2019s Excavating Inc., a large construction contractor in Michigan.\n\nThe numbers of black rhinos have been increasing in recent years with stricter conservation management, but dozens are still illegally poached each year for their horns, which are sold on the black market for use in traditional Chinese medicine and as a status symbol.\n\nThe horns are composed largely of the protein keratin, also the chief component in hair and fingernails.\n\n\u201cLegal, well-regulated hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation,\u201d said Laury Parramore, spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Trump administration has issued another two.\n\nAlthough President Donald Trump has derided trophy hunting in a tweet as a \u201chorror show,\u201d his adult sons are avid big-game hunters and his administration reversed Obama-era restrictions on the import of endangered elephant and lion trophies from several African countries.\n\nRecords show Mr Peyerk was represented in his effort to get a rhino permit by John Jackson, a Louisiana attorney who provides free legal assistance to trophy hunters through a nonprofit group called Conservation Force.\n\nHe is also a past president of Safari Club International, a trophy hunting group that has lobbied the Trump administration to loosen import restrictions on endangered big game animals.\n\nMr Jackson was appointed in 2018 to the International Wildlife Conservation Council, an advisory board set up by then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to help promote trophy hunting.\n\nMr Jackson said he sees no conflict between advising the Fish and Wildlife Service on policy issues while also petitioning the agency on the behalf of his legal clients.\n\n\u201cThe permitting is just one cog in the conservation wheel of what we do,\u201d Mr Jackson said last week. \u201cWe establish and support programs on the ground that enhance the survival of the particular specie. Our mission is the recovery of the species population, not the private interest of the hunter.\u201d\n\nThe $400,000 paid by Mr Peyrek went to a trust fund set up by the Namibian government for wildlife management, conservation, rural development and other activities aimed at promoting the coexistence of humans and wildlife.\n\nThe Humane Society criticised the federal decision to allow Peyerk to import the black rhino\u2019s taxidermied remains.\n\n\u201cWe urge our federal government to end this pay-to-slay scheme that delivers critically endangered rhino trophies to wealthy Americans while dealing a devastating blow to rhino conservation,\u201d said Kitty Block, the head of the Humane Society of the United States and Humane Society International.\n\n\u201cWhile we cannot turn back the clock to save this animal, the administration can stop the US from further contributing to the demise of this species by refusing future import permits of black rhino trophies.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press", "description": "A trophy hunter will be issued a permit to import the skin, skull and horns from a rare black rhinoceros he shot in Africa, the Trump administration has said.\u00a0 Chris\u00a0Peyerk of Shelby Township, Michigan, applied last year for the permit required by the Fish and Wildlife Service to import animals protected under the Endangered Species Act, documents show.", "authors": ["Michael Biesecker"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/08/trophy-hunting-rhino.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
