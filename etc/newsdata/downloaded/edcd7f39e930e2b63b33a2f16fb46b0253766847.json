Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility.\n\nThe issue involving the Bidens resurfaced Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine.\n\nSchweizer implied Hunter Biden's credentials didn't match with the position he held, and that the situation looked suspicious.\n\n\"He is supposed to be advising them on natural gas regulatory issues. He has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas. So the question is, What is he being paid for? He's not being paid for his expertise, he has none,\" Schweizer said. \"His father at this time is the point person on U.S. policy to Ukraine.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe author said Trump was \"right\" to ask for an investigation and accused Hunter of lying.\n\n\"Donald Trump is right to ask the question and to ask that there be an investigation to see what Hunter Biden was being paid for. Joe Biden has offered no answers,\" Schweizer said. \"Hunter Biden, when he's been asked about this, has lied repeatedly and they've been proven lies by ABC News and other outlets.\"\n\n\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.", "description": "Author\u00a0Peter Schweizer\u00a0on Friday night addressed the questions surrounding Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement with a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father, former Vice President Joe Biden, oversaw America\u2019s Ukraine policy.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/21/694940094001_6088225189001_6088213297001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
