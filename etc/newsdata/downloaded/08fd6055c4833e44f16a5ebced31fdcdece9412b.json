Photo: Rick Friedman/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nOver the past year, America\u2019s meritocracy has racked up some poor marks.\n\nBack in March, the \u201cVarsity Blues\u201d scandal revealed that a bunch of extremely rich, incredibly insecure parents had been placing their academically unaccomplished children into selective colleges through an elaborate mix of bribery and fraud. This news triggered an explosion of self-righteous Schadenfreude among upper-middle-class parents who\u2019d been working their tails off to buy their kids\u2019 admission to elite finishing schools the old-fashioned way (i.e., through the purchase of a home in an affluent suburb with well-funded public schools, the hiring of a pricey SAT tutor, the bankrolling of various impressive-sounding extracurriculars, etc.). Which, in turn, prompted the self-righteous children of such bourgeois parents to decry their class\u2019s \u201cdream hoarding\u201d ways: A chorus of scholars and pundits observed that, even if America were a perfect meritocracy (untainted by the criminality of Felicity Huffman & Co.), the already affluent\u2019s superior capacity to invest in their offspring\u2019s \u201chuman capital\u201d would be enough to undermine mobility and entrench privilege.\n\nThat critique garnered renewed attention in recent weeks with the release of Yale Law professor Daniel Markovits\u2019s book The Meritocracy Trap. Building on the themes of his viral 2015 commencement address, Markovits\u2019s book argues that the American economy has become grossly inequitable and misery-inducing precisely because of \u201cmeritocracy\u2019s successes.\u201d In his telling, inequality is now driven primarily by the bifurcation of the labor market. Under existing economic arrangements, those at the top of the ladder really do \u201cearn\u201d their privilege by accruing exorbitantly valuable skills and exercising them at a relentless pace. The new one percent is the opposite of a leisure class, as its members work \u201cwith crushing intensity, exploiting their expensive educations in order to extract a return.\u201d Then, they invest that return into their children\u2019s expensive educations, thereby reproducing an exceptionally anxious, entitled, and high-skilled pseudo-aristocracy, which is killing upward mobility and eroding human welfare for poor and rich alike.\n\nThere\u2019s value in spotlighting the inequities inherent to actually existing meritocracy. And all things equal, it is better to expose and punish rich parents who criminally subvert meritocratic institutions than to let them run wild.\n\nAnd yet all this hand-wringing about dream hoarders \u2014 and basking in Lori Loughlin\u2019s comeuppance \u2014 threatens to obscure just how anti-meritocratic America\u2019s elite institutions and economy remain.\n\nTake Harvard University\u2019s admissions practices. A recent, controversial lawsuit accusing the school of discriminating against Asian applicants forced Harvard to disclose \u201cdetailed information on [the] demographics, academics, and extracurricular activities\u201d of its applicants, along with its internal ratings of prospective students. This provided researchers with unprecedented insight into how America\u2019s premier university rations access to its campus. Last week, three economists unearthed one stunning fact hiding within that data: Between 2009 and 2014, 43 percent of the white students admitted to Harvard were either athletes, legacies, faculty kids, or the offspring of major donors. And white students with these characteristics were held to a decidedly less-demanding standard than those who lacked them: Roughly three-quarters of these applicants would have been rejected, had they lacked athletic skills or connections, according to the economists\u2019 analysis. Critically, athletic admissions often function as a proxy for familial wealth and/or connections.\n\nAs Slate\u2019s Jordan Weissmann explains:\n\nLegacy preferences, which give an edge to the children of alums, have long drawn criticism for skewing college admissions in favor of white, well-off families. But in recent years, athletic recruiting has come under scrutiny for playing a similar role, especially in sports like sailing, skiing, lacrosse, and crew that are particularly popular among wealthier white Americans. The Harvard Crimson\u2019s annual survey found that among the Class of 2019, 43.2 percent of legacies and 20 percent of athletes come from households that earn more than $500,000 a year, versus 15.4 percent of the class overall.\n\nThese dimensions of advantage are largely class-based (you don\u2019t have to be white to give a large donation to Harvard, or finance your child\u2019s sailing education, but you do probably need a lot of disposable income). But owing to the racial composition of America\u2019s economic elite, affirmative action for the wealthy is tantamount to affirmative action for whites: While 43 percent of white Harvard students were athletes, legacies, or the children of faculty or donors, less than 16 percent of their nonwhite peers fit into one of those favored categories.\n\nRegardless, for the purposes of assessing the degree of meritocracy in America\u2019s elite institutions, evidence of class-based affirmative action will suffice. In total, about 30 percent of all seats in each Harvard class are effectively reserved for children with rich, well-connected parents, and/or athletic skills. The historian Nils Gilman tweeted last month that this 30 percent \u201cis the \u2018Real Harvard\u2019 \u2014 that is, the profitable bit, the part that the aptly named Harvard Corporation cares about; the rest of the students are financial loss leaders whose purpose is to provide a brand halo for the Real Harvard, and to justify the tax shelter.\u201d\n\nIn other words: Per Gilman, Harvard is effectively a business that auctions off certificates of legitimation to the American aristocracy\u2019s lackluster heirs and heiresses \u2014 that highly selective, meritocratic college it maintains is just an elaborate means of preserving the value of its aristocracy-legitimation services.\n\nGilman\u2019s assessment is surely a bit reductive. But it contains more than a kernel of truth. Harvard is, in fact, sustained by the patronage of superrich benefactors, not the tuition paid by its students. In 2016, the university took in $1.19 billion in donations, a figure that\u2019s several multiples of what it accrued in tuition. That same year, the Harvard Crimson published this illustration of the university\u2019s finances (note: The endowment is composed in no small part by past gifts from large-dollar donors):\n\nChart: The Harvard Crimson\n\nNow, even if we stipulate that Harvard is an institution that exists to legitimize hereditary privilege \u2014 by providing its patrons\u2019 \u201cfailsons and fail-daughters\u201d with the same prestigious credential that it bestows on academically elite strivers \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t necessarily follow that all of America\u2019s meritocratic institutions serve the same basic function. But viewed from a certain angle, Harvard\u2019s operations can look analogous to those of the American upper class more broadly: Whether on Harvard\u2019s campus or in the economy writ large, the cutthroat competition between bourgeois strivers for well-remunerated jobs serves to lend an aura of meritocratic legitimacy to the (relatively) idle and hereditary capitalist class whose fortunes underwrite the whole shebang. As Malcolm Harris writes in his critical appraisal of The Meritocracy Trap:\n\nMarkovits consistently refers to his meritocrats as \u201cthe 1 percent,\u201d but in a mistake so fundamental it can\u2019t possibly be a mere oversight, he doesn\u2019t mean the top 1 percent by wealth (those with assets over $10 million), he means the top 1 percent by income (those with an annual household income of over $420,000). The groups are hardly comparable \u2014 one is made up largely of people who own companies, the other of the people who figure out how to make those companies profitable \u2026 In the May 2018 issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Saez, Zucman, and Piketty repeatedly, explicitly reject the thesis that the richest income earners owe the bulk of their fortunes to labor rather than capital. \u201cThe top 1% derives over half of their incomes from capital, the top 0.1% more than two thirds today,\u201d they write. The difference between their less-than-one-third and Markovits\u2019s \u201cperhaps two-thirds or even three-quarters\u201d is massive. In a footnote the economists add, \u201cIf anything, it is likely that we underestimate the rise of the capital income share at the top over recent decades.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, America\u2019s highest-earning meritocrats, and its biggest recipients of passive capital income, heavily overlap. And Markovits does summon significant evidence that today\u2019s \u00dcber-rich hustle more than yesterday\u2019s did.\n\nBut in between bouts of lamenting our meritocracy\u2019s excesses, we should take a moment to acknowledge its limited reach. In many respects, this is still Wyatt Koch\u2019s country, we \u201cdream hoarders\u201d just work here.", "description": "A new study reveals that Harvard\u2019s admissions process bestows many forms of affirmative action on wealthy, white applicants.
