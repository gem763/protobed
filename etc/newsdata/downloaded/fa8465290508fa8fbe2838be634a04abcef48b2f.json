(Alex Brandon/Pool/Reuters)\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recommended colleagues as potential hires for Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign soon after the South Bend, Ind., mayor launched his presidential bid in mid-April.\n\nButtigieg campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed to Bloomberg News that Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, had initiated the contact by sending several emails recommending individuals as potential campaign hires. A Zuckerberg-Chan family spokesman said that the employees had asked to be recommended.\n\nZuckerberg overlapped with Buttigieg at Harvard, where the two shared mutual friends, and Buttigieg was one of the first 300 users of Facebook. Zuckerberg visited Buttigieg in 2017 and live-streamed a tour of South Bend given by the mayor.\n\n\u201cHaving seen Mark\u2019s visit to South Bend in 2017 and Facebook Live with Mayor Buttigieg, colleagues later asked Mark and Priscilla to connect them with the Buttigieg campaign as they were interested in joining,\u201d Zuckerberg-Chan spokesman Ben LaBolt said in a statement. \u201cMark and Priscilla have not decided who to support for President.\u201d\n\nLaBolt did not answer a follow-up asking if the couple had made similar connections with other campaigns.\n\nOf the several individuals recommended, two are currently on staff: Eric Mayefsky, senior digital-analytics adviser, and Nina Wornhoff, organizing data manager. Mayefsky previously worked at Quora, a startup founded by former Facebook employees, while Wornhoff worked as a machine-learning engineer at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and in Democratic politics in Indiana, Buttigieg\u2019s home state.\n\n\u201cFrom the CNN Town hall in March to our launch a month later, we literally got 7,000 resumes,\u201d Meagher said. \u201cI think that he (Zuckerberg) thought Eric would be a good staff hire with a lot of experience and same with Nina.\u201d\n\nThe news comes days after Zuckerberg defended free speech on his platform and condemned Chinese censorship. He also defended a recently announced policy that allows politicians and political campaigns to create false of misleading content on the platform.\n\nZuckerberg is scheduled to testify on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee on Facebook\u2019s business impact.\n\nFacebook has come under fire from other Democratic campaigns during the election cycle, especially by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), who has called for the breakup of giant tech firms. In July, leaked audio revealed Zuckerberg called Warren an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to the company.", "description": "Zuckerberg overlapped with Buttigieg at Harvard, where the two shared mutual friends, and Buttigieg was one of the first 300 users of Facebook.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "Mona Charen", "David French", "William Z.
