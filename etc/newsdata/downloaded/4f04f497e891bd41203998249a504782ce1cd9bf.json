A4 is testing whether a drug called solanezumab can slow memory loss in people with elevated levels of amyloid plaque in their brains. They may experience no memory loss yet, or report signs of cognitive decline but pass cognitive tests.\n\nAmyloid is a protein produced in the brain that can build up and form plaque deposits that researchers believe play a key role in the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nEli Lilly & Co. makes solanezumab, which failed in previous trials in patients already diagnosed with symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But researchers hope that by intervening earlier and at a higher dose, they may have success this time.\n\nThe randomized controlled trial spans 4.5 years, during which participants get infusions of either solanezumab or a placebo. There are 1,169 participants, all of them 65 to 85 years old.\n\nMr. Berggren is one of them.\n\nMr. Berggren goes to Boston University every month to receive an infusion. Neither he nor Dr. Rentz knows if it\u2019s a placebo or the anti-amyloid drug, solanezumab. Photo: M. Scott Brauer for The Wall Street Journal\n\nEvery month for the past three years he\u2019s driven to Boston University for treatment. The study is a double-blind, randomized control trial, so neither participants nor researchers know if patients receive the drug or a placebo.\n\nEvery three months he also does cognitive testing to assess his memory, executive function and speed of processing, among other things.\n\nSo far, so good, Mr. Berggren says. The retired auditor and database administrator with a sardonic sense of humor rattles off names and dates like a computer. He talks fondly about the seniors he helps with basic iPad and computer questions twice a week at the local senior center.\n\nHe handles grocery shopping and cooking at home and manages to function independently\u2014with the company of their cats, Rusty and Lady\u2014when Dr. Rentz travels for work.\n\nBut red flags more than a year earlier first caused Dr. Rentz to suspect something may be wrong with his memory.\n\nDr. Rentz has studied Alzheimer\u2019s disease for more than 30 years. The couple experienced the disease firsthand when Mr. Berggren\u2019s mother began experiencing memory problems and moved in with them for several years before dying in 2003. \u201cWhen my husband started to exhibit memory problems, I was like every other caregiver, with my head in the sand,\u201d Dr. Rentz says.\n\nThe defining moment was when his son gave them a new camera for Christmas four years ago. They took it on vacation. A couple of months later his son called up asking if he could borrow the camera.\n\n\u201cRay was adamant that he never gave us a camera for Christmas,\u201d Dr. Rentz says. \u201cHe had no recollection of the camera. And they kept arguing about it and finally I went upstairs and got the camera.\u201d\n\nGetting him into the trial wasn\u2019t easy. It required some back and forth with Lilly to ensure there was no conflict of interest. (The company declined to comment.) It took four months to make it happen. Mr. Berggren was assigned to Boston University researchers to avoid those conflicts.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t work in this field for 30 years to help find a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and then not be able to help the person I love,\u201d she says.\n\nReisa Sperling, a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School, is the principal investigator of the A4 trial, which includes patients at 67 sites across four countries.\n\nDr. Sperling has worked closely with Dr. Rentz for decades and knows Mr. Berggren well. She says it was important that he not be a participant at their site. \u201cWe have to be careful that we in no way influence what his participation in the trial is,\u201d Dr. Sperling says.\n\nHer grandfather and father died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIt\u2019s a useful thing for me to always remember the humans on the other side of this important scientific study,\u201d Dr. Sperling says. \u201cI have definitely seen this up close and personal and having Dr. Rentz\u2019s husband, knowing him as a person, makes me again realize how important the stakes are.\u201d\n\nDr. Sperling says researchers made two changes to the trial in early 2018, after it started, because of the drug\u2019s failures in previous trials. They quadrupled the dose given to those receiving the drug and extended the trial to 4\u00bd years.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you have a relative with Alzheimer\u2019s disease? When did you first notice their memory slipping? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe first patients enrolled in the trial in 2014 began moving to the open-label phase, in which patients in both groups are given the option of taking the drug, in early 2019. They can continue taking the drug until the trial is complete, which is expected in late 2022. (The trial had rolling admission but is not accepting new patients now.)\n\nLilly and the federal National Institute on Aging are funding the study.\n\nDr. Sperling says some participants came into the study because of subjective complaints of cognitive decline. To qualify, they had to perform normally on cognitive tests. Then they underwent PET scans to detect amyloid. Those with positive amyloid scans are more likely to have said they noticed subtle cognitive changes and perform a bit worse on memory tests, though they still pass them, Dr. Sperling says.\n\n\u201cThe amyloid hypothesis has come under quite a bit of fire,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this suggests that at this stage of the disease, there is a relationship between amyloid and very subtle memory changes.\u201d\n\nDr. Rentz met Mr. Berggren in 1992 at a mutual friend\u2019s Christmas party. Mr. Berggren, who had two children from a previous marriage, recalls meeting Dr. Rentz. When she introduced herself she spelled her last name.\n\nThe next day he looked her up in the phone book. \u201cOne thing led to another and we got married four years later,\u201d he says.\n\nThey cherish the house they live in, a modified Cape Cod with a spacious backyard. Along with volunteering at the local senior community center, he audits classes at Boston University. Right now he is taking a cybercrime class. Last semester he took a film and literature class. \u201cI\u2019m doing Sudoku all the time on my phone,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Rentz worried that her husband\u2019s memory impairments might disqualify him from being eligible for the study, but he passed the cognitive tests. The toughest part was when they got the PET scan results showing he was amyloid positive.\n\nParticipants in the A4 trial passed cognitive tests. But brain scans show that they have elevated levels of amyloid plaque, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in their brains.

The good news is that you qualify for the study,\u201d she recalls thinking.\n\nMr. Berggren and Dr. Rentz both say he appears to be doing pretty well. When she says he recently repaired the lawn mower, he corrects her. It was the snowblower.\n\nStill, she says, \u201cHe forgets events and things. He\u2019ll say, \u2018We\u2019ve never done that,\u2019 and I know we have. He\u2019s also forgotten about some of his appointments recently.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat husband doesn\u2019t screw up his appointments?\u201d Mr. Berggren exclaims. He says he\u2019s not sure if his memory has gotten worse, but he isn\u2019t fretting over it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never been a worrier in that regard,\u201d Dr. Rentz says. \u201cI think a little bit of unawareness is great. I\u2019m not worried either. Yet.\u201d\n\nFor now, life goes on. They\u2019ve developed consistent routines to make things easier. She takes the same train every day to work and back. They look at the calendar on Sundays to remind themselves of what\u2019s coming up for the week.\n\nThey have plans to go to Chicago for Thanksgiving and on a cruise in January.\n\n\u201cWe make the best of what we have today,\u201d Dr. Rentz says. \u201cRay has always had a great sense of humor and we take life lightly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many different things that could wrong,\u201d Mr. Berggren says. \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s is competing. I\u2019m just going to try to enjoy life with my wife.\u201d\n\nThe Stakes of the A4 Trial\n\nAmyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can appear in the brain 10 to 15 years before someone receives an Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis.\n\nTogether, amyloid and tau\u2014another protein that forms tangles inside nerve cells\u2014disrupt neural networks and are believed to lead to memory impairment and eventually symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nHaving amyloid plaques doesn\u2019t guarantee that you will later develop clinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease, though it\u2019s considered a good predictor. The theory, says Ronald Petersen, director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center in Rochester, Minn., is that at a certain point of amyloid accumulation, the tau accelerates, resulting in the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease symptoms.\n\nResearchers are closely watching the A4 trial, given the failures of previous anti-amyloid drugs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see some clinical signal that would motivate me to be more enthusiastic about moving earlier with some of these\u201d drugs, Dr. Petersen says. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t happened yet. I think the A4 trial is positioned to really answer some of these questions.\u2026If the A4 trial is negative, that will be a serious problem for the whole amyloid treatment approach.\u201d\n\nHe believes research needs to continue on all fronts, be it targeting amyloid and tau or looking at some of the proteins that define other neurodegenerative diseases, like Lewy body dementia, and vascular disease.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a silver bullet that is going to stamp out this disease,\u201d Dr. Petersen says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take combination therapy.\u201d\n\nWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com", "description": "What life is like for a Harvard professor who helped design the A4 drug trial and is married to one of the study subjects.", "authors": ["Sumathi Reddy", "Sumathi.Reddy Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108228/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
