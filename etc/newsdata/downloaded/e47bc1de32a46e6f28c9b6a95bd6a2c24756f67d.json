She's also the first openly gay host.\n\nMaddow is known for being extremely intelligent \u2014 she won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, but it's obvious too, in her lengthy, well-researched monologues that she opens her show with every day. She's also more civil than some of her peers. She's chided Pat Buchanan for telling another commentator to \" shut up,\" and she refuses to act as a referee while guests fight between each other, unlike her competitor's shows.\n\nMaddow did not come straight to journalism. Friends thought she'd be a professor or an activist. But after deciding she liked explaining things to people on a local radio station, it was only a matter of time. She went from radio station to bigger radio station, to television, to being the face of MSNBC.\n\nAs Ben Wallace-Wells put it for Rolling Stone, \"What Maddow is trying to build is a different channel for liberal anger, an outsider's channel, one that steers the viewer's attention away from the theater of politics and toward the exercise of power, which is to say toward policy.\"\n\nHere's her life so far.", "description": "From AIDS activist and scholar to becoming one of the most successful television hosts in America.
