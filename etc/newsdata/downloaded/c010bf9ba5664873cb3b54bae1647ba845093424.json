A Colorado native, he served as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which is based in Colorado and hears appeals from six western states, before his appointment to the Supreme Court in April 2017. He has also worked as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Justice, where he helped oversee its civil litigating divisions; as a partner at a law firm; as a law professor; and as a law clerk for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy.\n\nOriginalism teaches only that the Constitution\u2019s original meaning is fixed; meanwhile, of course, new applications of that meaning will arise with new developments and new technologies. Consider a few examples. As originally understood, the term \u201ccruel\u201d in the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause referred (at least) to methods of execution deliberately designed to inflict pain. That never changes. But that meaning doesn\u2019t just encompass those particular forms of torture known at the founding. It also applies to deliberate efforts to inflict a slow and painful death by laser. Take another example. As originally understood, the First Amendment protected speech. That guarantee doesn\u2019t just apply to speech on street corners or in newspapers; it applies equally to speech on the Internet. Or consider the Fourth Amendment. As originally understood, it usually required the government to get a warrant to search a home. And that meaning applies equally whether the government seeks to conduct a search the old-fashioned way by rummaging through the place or in a more modern way by using a thermal imaging device to see inside. Whether it\u2019s the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on torture, its protection of speech, or its restrictions on searches, the meaning remains constant even as new applications arise.\n\nLiving constitutionalists often complain we can\u2019t know the original understanding because the document\u2019s too old and cryptic. Hardly. We figure out the original meaning of old and difficult texts all the time. Just ask any English professor who teaches Shakespeare or Beowulf.\n\nI suspect the real complaint of living constitutionalists isn\u2019t with old laws generally so much as it is with the particular terms of this old law. The Constitution is short\u2014only about 7,500 words, including all its amendments. It doesn\u2019t dictate much about the burning social and political questions they care about. Instead, it leaves the resolution of those matters to elections and votes and the amendment process. And it seems this is the real problem for the critics. For when it comes to the social and political questions of the day they care most about, many living constitutionalists would prefer to have philosopher-king judges swoop down from their marble palace to ordain answers rather than allow the people and their representatives to discuss, debate, and resolve them. You could even say the real complaint here is with our democracy.\n\nSuppose originalism does lead to a result you happen to dislike in this or that case. So what? The \u201cjudicial Power\u201d of Article III of the Constitution isn\u2019t a promise of all good things. Letting dangerous and obviously guilty criminals who have gravely injured their victims go free just because an officer forgot to secure a warrant or because the prosecutor neglected to bring a witness to trial for confrontation seems like a bad idea to plenty of people. But do you really want judges to revise the Constitution to avoid those \u201cbad\u201d results? Or do you believe that judges should enforce the law\u2019s protections equally for everyone, regardless of how inefficient or unpopular or old the law might be? Regardless of who benefits today\u2014the criminal or the police; the business or the employee; immigrants or ICE?\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Originalism is a theory focused on process, not on substance. It is not \u201cConservative\u201d with a big C focused on politics. It is conservative in the small c sense that it seeks to conserve the meaning of the Constitution as it was written. The fact is, a good originalist judge will not hesitate to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution\u2019s original meaning, regardless of contemporary political consequences. Whether that means allowing protesters to burn the American flag (the First Amendment); prohibiting the government from slapping a GPS tracking device on the underside of your car without a warrant (the Fourth Amendment); or insisting that juries\u2014not judges\u2014should decide the facts that increase the penalty you face in a criminal case (the Sixth Amendment). In my own judicial career, I\u2019ve written many originalist rulings with so-called \u201cliberal\u201d results. Like United States v. Carloss, where I ruled that the police violated a criminal defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights by entering the curtilage of his home without a warrant despite four conspicuously posted no trespassing signs. Or Sessions v. Dimaya, where I ruled that an immigrant couldn\u2019t constitutionally be punished according to a law so vague that judges were forced to give it content by fiat. Or Carpenter v. United States, where I explained that simply giving your property to another doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you lose all your Fourth Amendment rights in it. I could go on and on. So could any originalist judge.\n\nBesides, if we\u2019re going to measure an interpretive theory by its results, consider this. Virtually the entire anticanon of constitutional law we look back upon today with regret came about when judges chose to follow their own impulses rather than follow the Constitution\u2019s original meaning. Look, for example, at Dred Scott and Korematsu. Neither can be defended as correct in light of the Constitution\u2019s original meaning; each depended on serious judicial invention by judges who misguidedly thought they were providing a \u201cgood\u201d answer to a pressing social problem of the day. A majority in Korematsu, unmoored from originalist principles, upheld the executive internment without trial of American citizens of Japanese descent despite our Constitution\u2019s express guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws. A majority in Dred Scott, also disregarding originalist principles, held that Congress had no power to outlaw slavery in the Territories, even though the Constitution clearly gave Congress the power to make laws governing the Territories. In both cases, judges sought to pursue policy ends they thought vital. Theirs was a living and evolving Constitution. And often enough it may be tempting for a judge to do what he thinks best for society in the moment, to bend the law a little to an end he desires, to trade just a bit of judicial integrity for political expediency. After all, passing majorities will applaud judicial efforts to follow their wishes. But as Korematsu and Dred Scott illustrate, the pursuit of political ends through judicial means will often and ironically bring about a far worse result than anticipated\u2014a sort of constitutional karma.\n\nEven when it comes to more prosaic cases, leaving things to the moral imagination of judges invites trouble. Just consider the \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test the Court invented in the 1960s to redefine what qualifies as a search for Fourth Amendment purposes. Oh, it sounded nice enough. But under that judge-made doctrine, the Court has held\u2014and I\u2019m not making this up\u2014that a police helicopter hovering 400 feet above your home doesn\u2019t offend a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d The Court has even held that the government can snoop through materials you\u2019ve entrusted to the care of third parties because, in its judgment, that, too, doesn\u2019t invade a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d But who really believes that? The car you let the valet park; the medical records your doctor promised to keep confidential; the emails you sent to your closest friend. You don\u2019t have a reasonable expectation of privacy against the government in any of those things? Really?\n\nExcerpted from \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It,\u201d by Neil Gorsuch.
