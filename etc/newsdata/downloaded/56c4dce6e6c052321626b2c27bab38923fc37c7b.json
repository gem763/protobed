To secure enough votes to pass the House, it will require the backing of labor groups\u2014which want to see the agreement changed so its standards are more enforceable.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said Friday he can\u2019t see bringing it to the floor for a vote without labor\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cIt would probably be doubtful that we will be able to get there if we don\u2019t come to an agreement with the workers of America who feel that they\u2019ve been badly hurt by Nafta,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should Democrats take a cue from labor groups when it comes to trade deals? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nNo significant trade unions have endorsed the deal. Most say they want to see what changes Democrats and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer can agree to.\n\nUSMCA raises labor standards in an effort to improve working conditions in Mexico and tightens rules for auto-industry trade in an effort to raise wages. While labor groups including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said it is an improvement from the North American Free Trade Agreement, the new deal has been widely criticized for not having stronger enforcement provisions to prevent U.S. companies from moving across the border to cut costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to sell a car without an engine or wheels,\u201d said Richard Trumka, president of the AFL\u2013CIO, the largest labor organization in America. He recently returned from a visit to Mexico where he met with President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador for two hours to express his concerns.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting with House Democrats last Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Democrats were \u201con the path to yes\u201d on the agreement and cited Mr. Trumka.\n\n\u201cEvery time I speak to Richard Trumka, he sings the praises of how we have kept our values, our priorities intact as we go forward,\u201d she said, according to a Democratic aide, telling the caucus she would have an update on the agreement \u201dcertainly by next week.\u201d\n\nLabor advocates opposed Nafta in 1993 because they feared that jobs would leave the U.S. for Mexico and elsewhere. Democrats who supported the agreement feel burned because that is what happened, and it has cost the party some critical support. Union workers in places such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan supported President Trump in 2016, partly because he promised to bring jobs back to the U.S. and to boost manufacturing.\n\nDemocrats made some headway in winning those voters back in the 2018 midterms and now, with the majority in the House, hope to avoid upsetting them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to go against labor,\u201d said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D., Ill.) on Friday.\n\nTo that end, Mr. Lighthizer has been meeting with Democrats regularly to iron out objections, though he has said that he doesn\u2019t want to reopen the agreement to make significant changes since it has already been ratified by Mexico. Trump administration officials didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nMany lawmakers see the deal\u2019s window for passage in Congress narrowing, given that the presidential race next year will likely diminish chances for compromise. Democrats will be less likely to buck their party\u2019s nominee, and while that is yet to be decided, top-tier candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and former Vice President Joe Biden have called for changes to USMCA.\n\nMexico this year passed a bill aimed at ending the practice of \u201cprotection unions,\u201d in which labor leaders close to management ratify contracts without consent from the workers. That was one key request from U.S. officials.\n\nBut under USMCA, any party can block a panel that was formed to settle a trade dispute. Mr. Trumka opposes that. Because disputes often take years to resolve, he would also like to see a measure added that blocks products from crossing the border if they are from companies accused of violating the agreement.\n\n\u201cIn the past, these cases have taken eight to nine years, and the whole time they continue to violate the agreement,\u201d Mr. Trumka said.\n\nHouse Republicans are expected to largely support the agreement\u2014the GOP-controlled Senate is likely to pass it as well\u2014and they have been attempting to pressure Mrs. Pelosi to bring it to the floor for a vote. But labor provisions are also important to them.\n\nGOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania said that before he would commit to supporting the deal, he plans to talk to building trades and labor groups and wants \u201cto make sure that labor protections are there.\u201d\n\n\u2014Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "description": "Support from labor groups will be a deciding factor in whether the Trump administration\u2019s renegotiated trade deal with Mexico and Canada sees a vote in the House.", "authors": ["Natalie Andrews", "Natalie.Andrews Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109733/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
