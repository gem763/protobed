He squawked, clucked, he flapped his arms maniacally. Every now and again, he\u2019d scream some indecipherable catchphrase which made him sound even more ridiculous. Passers-by stopped and stared and laughed at the absurdity.\n\nInside, the real-life \u2018Chicken\u2019 Corbyn was behaving in much the same manner as MPs debated holding a general election.\n\nIt is a most strange world that has a Leader of the Opposition who genuinely fears the chance to govern.\n\nBut that is exactly how Mr Corbyn presents himself. Frozen. Frit. He hates the Government yet he is happy for it to remain in power. What a pathetic sight.\n\nJeremy Corbyn addressing MPs in the Commons. Henry Deedes: 'It is a most strange world that has a Leader of the Opposition who genuinely fears the chance to govern'\n\nBarely any Labour MPs bothered to even show up for the debate. Swathes of green leather abounded. The shadow cabinet was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\u2018Where are they all?\u2019 yelled the Government benches.\n\nClass clown Michael Fabricant (Con, Lichfield) suggested the Speaker launch an investigation into whether the Commons annunciator was working properly.\n\nThe Prime Minister announced wearily that the Leader of the Opposition had run out of excuses. The Benn Act had passed, the extension from the EU until the end of January was now secured. It was time for an election, he announced.\n\nHe compared Parliament to the Peanuts character Charlie Brown \u2018endlessly running up to kick the ball only to have it taken away\u2019. Beside him, health minister Nadine Dorries made little waving gestures at the Labour benches: \u2018Bye-bye!\u2019\n\nCorbyn spent most of the PM\u2019s speech receiving advice from with his chief whip, Nick Brown. Extraordinary. Nothing about his body language when he is with colleagues ever suggests that he is the one actually calling the shots. Possibly because he isn\u2019t.\n\nJeremy Corbyn in the Commons during an election debate with Prime Minister Boris Johnson\n\nWhen he eventually stood up, he rattled off all the reasons Johnson still can\u2019t be trusted, even taking him to task for not kicking the bucket instead of asking the EU for a Brexit extension. \u2018He said he\u2019d die in a ditch \u2013 another broken promise!\u2019\n\nAt one point, Corbyn pretended to lose his temper at an interruption from David Mundell (Con, Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale). He really shouldn\u2019t do this. I\u2019ve seen elderly codgers shaking their fists at local youths cast more authority.\n\nBehind him, the battery hens chirped as supportively as they could.\n\n\u2018How can we believe a single word that comes out that man\u2019s mouth?\u2019 asked Angela Eagle (Lab, Wallasey) pointing in the Prime Minister\u2019s direction.\n\nPaula Sherriff (Lab, Dewsbury) staged an ambush, demanding an apology for the abuse she\u2019d received after the recent \u2018humbug\u2019 remark Johnson made to her. The PM suggested Corbyn\u2019s buddy John McDonnell might apologise first for comments he once made about lynching Tory MP Esther McVey. Stupid. He should have just left it alone. Seema Malhotra (Lab, Feltham and Heston) claimed an election in December was a deliberate act of \u2018voter suppression\u2019, an inference that people wouldn\u2019t bother to vote when it\u2019s cold and dark. Why this might favour one party over another wasn\u2019t clear. Desperado stuff.\n\n'At one point, Corbyn pretended to lose his temper at an interruption from David Mundell (Con, Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale). He really shouldn\u2019t do this. I\u2019ve seen elderly codgers shaking their fists at local youths cast more authority'\n\nThe SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford blathered on far too long, as is his way, and made the mistake of using the phrase \u2018in conclusion\u2019. This led the rest of the House to let out a collective \u2018Hooray!\u2019 Typical, remarked Blackers huffily, Westminster telling Scotland to shut up as usual. Tory chairman James Cleverley barked: \u2018No, just you!\u2019\n\nThe result of the consequent vote, in which the Government failed to get the two-thirds majority required under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, came as little surprise.\n\nJeremy Corbyn didn\u2019t even show up. Held captive by his advisers, possibly. A shambles, really.\n\nJohnson accused him of running away from the electorate.\n\nThe PM promised a new Bill for a December 12 election which would only require a simple majority and, with the Lib Dem and SNP support, this looks likely to pass.\n\nNot before time. Parliament is currently more clogged than a faulty J-bend. The whole place needs a long, heavy flush.", "description": "HENRY DEEDES: Outside the Commons yesterday, a man in a chicken outfit stood in the biting cold purporting to be Jeremy Corbyn.
