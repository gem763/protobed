He thinks we\u2019re in great shape, a lot better than we were last year, when we made the playoffs. We need to get through the playoffs. We\u2019ve got to win in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nGores was on hand Monday at the opening of the team\u2019s new training center and corporate headquarters in midtown Detroit. Coach Dwane Casey and Pistons players were also at the ceremony.\n\nThe new facility completes the team\u2019s move to the city from suburban Auburn Hills. The Pistons are entering their third season playing their games at Little Caesars Arena downtown.\n\nGores was asked about a possible contract extension for Drummond, the team\u2019s standout center. He spoke highly of Drummond but did not elaborate on any possible negotiations. He did say keeping Drummond in the fold is a priority.\n\n\u201cWe know how dedicated we are to each other,\u201d Gores said. \u201cI\u2019ve said it many times: He\u2019s very underrated in a lot of ways for what he does, and culturally he\u2019s been so good for this team, just in terms of his attitude, and just watching him really grow up. I met him when he was 18.\u201d\n\nDetroit has made the playoffs twice in the past four seasons, but the Pistons were swept in the first round both times. Last season it was at the hands of the Milwaukee Bucks. It was Casey\u2019s first season as Detroit\u2019s coach, and the Pistons were limited when Blake Griffin - after a terrific season - wasn\u2019t fully healthy in the playoffs.\n\nKeeping Griffin healthy is a big key this season, and the Pistons are also hopeful they\u2019ve improved their depth after adding Derrick Rose. Gores was asked if there might come a point when the team needs to consider a different path forward after relying on the core of Griffin, Drummond and point guard Reggie Jackson.\n\n\u201cI think right now we feel really good about where we\u2019re at,\u201d Gores said. \u201cObviously, we have to succeed and win, and judge by if we\u2019re not winning. But right now we feel really good about it.\u201d\n\nThe $90 million Henry Ford Detroit Pistons Performance Center includes a sports medicine, treatment and rehab facility managed by the Henry Ford Health System, as well as retail and public spaces. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan was also at the opening.\n\n\u201cThe Pistons have moved 250 employees into the city of Detroit today,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cFor every player on the court, there\u2019s another 20 people who are working here in operations, in ticket sales, in marketing and facilities, finance and trainers and the like.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "On the day the Detroit Pistons opened their new training facility, owner Tom Gores discussed his hopes for the upcoming season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
