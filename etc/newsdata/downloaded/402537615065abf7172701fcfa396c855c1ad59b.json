One is driven by illicit marijuana vapes, the other by fruity-flavored nicotine vapors. But the epidemic of deadly lung sickness this summer created an opportunity that officials seized, with President Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office announcement this week banning the flavored vapes that have lured millions of teens.\n\nTrump gave no indication he understood the distinction between the two substances when he announced the ban on Wednesday. \u201cPeople are dying with vaping,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people think vaping is wonderful, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s really not wonderful.\u201d\n\nHis comments conveniently merged the alarming growth in teen vaping with the outbreak of lung disease that states officials have mostly linked to vaping products that contain THC, the main psychoactive component of marijuana. The administration took one crisis and used it to stamp on another that had steadily captured Washington's attention.\n\nThe White House action against flavored e-cigarettes won\u2019t have any effect on marijuana vape regulations, which is up to the states where marijuana has been legalized. But the FDA and lawmakers have long had flavored vapes in their sights because of their role in a jarring increase in teenage nicotine use over the past two years after decades of decline.\n\nThe administration\u2019s sleight of hand infuriated lobbyists for vaping companies, who are leery of federal regulation, while encouraging marijuana companies, which want more of it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having salmonella in Romaine lettuce and calling to ban peanut butter. It is literally public health malpractice,\u201d said Mike Hogan, a lobbyist for the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association. Critics like Hogan say Trump\u2019s focus on e-cigarettes completely ignores the early state-level data that links cases of lung disease to cartridges containing THC.\n\nAn early report from Illinois and Wisconsin found that 84 percent of their lung disease cases were linked to marijuana vapes. New York state officials pointed to vitamin E acetate in THC oils as a primary culprit. California and Oregon each reported a death linked to marijuana vape cartridges.\n\nThe administration\u2019s flavor bans were propelled by sobering national survey figures showing teen vaping is rising. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb railed against flavored e-cigarettes during his tenure and supports the ban.\n\nBut the mystery lung illnesses is a different challenge, he said, and \u201cyou really need to separate both these issues.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s action contrasted with the cautious approach federal officials have taken to linking the vaping illnesses to any one product or substance until their investigation is complete.\n\nFDA\u2019s acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless and CDC Director Robert Redfield have urged consumers to avoid street products and THC oil, although Redfield took it a step further by suggesting that all e-cigarette users should \u201cconsider not using [e-cigarette] products.\u201d\n\nSome public health officials see these two strategies as different strands of a flawed policy.\n\n\"CDC has hyped up the risks of vaping so much that they have literally said nothing about youth vaping of marijuana,\" said Michael Siegel, a public health and tobacco control research at Boston University. \"They almost want to blame this on run-of-the-mill e-cigarette products to say 'I told you so.'\"\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Many report using THC and nicotine. Some report using nicotine containing products only.\u201d\n\nUnder federal law, the government could raid state-licensed dispensaries and remove all vape products, but even the White House cannot create new oversight of marijuana products beyond what is outlined in the Controlled Substances Act. To change that, Congress would have to reclassify marijuana \u2014 a measure far less likely to reach the president\u2019s desk than laws targeting the e-cigarette industry.\n\nMany lawmakers already had e-cigarettes in their sights. After Trump\u2019s action, congressional Democrats active on the issue talked past the evidence that the lung disease outbreak is linked to marijuana vapes much more than e-cigarettes in general.\n\nE&C Oversight subcommittee chair Diana DeGette, who plans a hearing on the lung disease outbreak and the safety of e-cigarettes later this month, said pulmonologists in her pot-legal state are unwilling to attribute the disease wholly to weed vapes.\n\nDeGette\u2019s announcement for the hearing makes no mention of marijuana. Neither does a letter from 23 Democratic senators demanding that federal agencies answer questions about the health impacts of e-cigarettes. One of the senators, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), has pushed for e-cigarette restrictions since 2009 \u2014 without ever mentioning pot. A vape product from a legal Oregon marijuana dispensary is linked to one of the lung disease deaths.\n\nMerkley\u2019s spokesperson said \u201cthe details are still murky\u201d on the death, adding that the senator expects FDA, once its research is finished, to take action against offending products, \u201cregardless of whether they contain nicotine, THC, both, or neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to go into schools, you have to pass state laws,\u201d said Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.), a Clinton-era HHS secretary who has introduced sweeping legislation to ban e-cigarette flavors and restrict sales. \u201cEverybody has got to do something.\u201d\n\nThe federal prohibition of marijuana means that decisions to change or issue new regulations on marijuana vape cartridges are entirely up to the 33 states that have legalized marijuana for medical or adult use.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s state legislature was considering regulating e-cigarettes, but not marijuana vape cartridges. In Massachusetts, Cannabis Commissioner Shawn Collins called for all vape cartridges to list every ingredient, including additives or thickening agents. New Jersey State Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, said he wants legislation banning all vape products, both tobacco and marijuana. And in Oregon, the AP reported that authorities will ask marijuana dispensaries to review their inventories and post warnings about potential vaping dangers.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Cannabis High-quality coverage of one of the fastest growing industries in the country.

One death in Oregon, however, has been reportedly caused by a cartridge purchased at a legal dispensary.\n\nBut there has been no real call to action for marijuana-legal states to revisit existing regulations.\n\nStates are sending marijuana vapor samples to FDA labs for testing, but since marijuana is federally illegal, there is no baseline against which to test samples. And without standardized packaging and ingredient lists, it\u2019s difficult for the agency to know what to look for.\n\n\u201cThere is a regulatory gap here. The states have legalized cannabis but they don\u2019t have any infrastructure to properly regulate it,\u201d Gottlieb said. Meanwhile, the market has filled with regulated and unregulated THC, as well as cannabidiol, or CBD, another marijuana derivative, which recently was partly legalized.\n\nThe federal marijuana prohibition limits the FDA\u2019s ability to regulate marijuana, even as vaping products like CBD have seemingly boomed in popularity, Gottlieb said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to say this is the FDA\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might not be within FDA\u2019s grasp.\u201d\n\nPaul Demko contributed to this report.", "description": "One is driven by illicit marijuana vapes, the other by fruity-flavored nicotine vapors.<b> </b>", "authors": ["Natalie Fertig", "Sarah Owermohle", "Adriel Bettelheim", "Adam Cancryn"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f3/c6/a275095d48b6906c0d485c7848ec/20190913-trump-vaping-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
