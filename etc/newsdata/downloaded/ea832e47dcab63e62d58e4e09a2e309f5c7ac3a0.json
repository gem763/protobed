UFC heavyweight debutant Yorgan De Castro delivers HUGE knockout at UFC 243 (VIDEO)", "language": "en", "text": "Cape Verde hasn\u2019t had too many top-level fighters down the years, but they may have one on their hands in Yorgan De Castro, who announced his arrival in the UFC with a crushing one-punch knockout on his octagon debut.\n\nDe Castro took on fellow debutant Justin Tafa, who arrived in the UFC with a fearsome reputation as a knockout artist. And while the Kiwi landed the first big punch of the night in the opening seconds to briefly stun De Castro, the man known as \u2018The Mad Titan\u2019 took the shot well before composing himself and eventually unleashing some stunning power of his own.\n\nDe Castro\u2019s nickname comes from the Marvel supervillain Thanos, and the 31-year-old rose to the occasion inside Marvel Stadium as he connected with a perfectly-timed right hand landed clean on Tafa\u2019s chin, sending him crashing to the canvas.\n\nDe Castro had earned his spot in the UFC after scoring a leg-kick KO in Dana White\u2019s Contender Series earlier this summer. And when Holly Holm\u2019s fight with Raquel Pennington was scrapped from the card due to injury, De Castro\u2019s fight with Tafa was promoted to the main card, where it opened the pay per view in front of more than 50,000 fans in Melbourne.\n\nAnd De Castro was overcome with emotion after scoring the biggest, and most important, win of his mixed martial arts career.\n\nTake it all in! \ud83d\udc4f#DWCS alum @DeCastroYorgan makes his Octagon debut in a HUGE way at #UFC243! \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa pic.twitter.com/UuyL2ViJd2 \u2014 UFC Europe (@UFCEurope) October 6, 2019\n\n\u201cI was expecting three rounds of war,\u201d said De Castro after the fight.\n\n\u201cBut he came hard at me with his chin open. I knew I just had to time him. I have power, man. If I land, they\u2019re going down.\u201d\n\nThe Cape Verdian said the experience of his UFC debut was an emotional one, but admitted he can\u2019t wait to get back into the octagon again, preferably before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWhen I was walking to the octagon, I just wanted to cry and thank God at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNot many people get to live their dreams. I'm living mine right now.\n\n\u201cI want to fight again in December. I want to fight again soon. Whenever, against whoever \u2013 I want to fight.\u201d", "description": "Cape Verde hasn\u2019t had too many top-level fighters down the years, but they may have one on their hands in Yorgan De Castro, who announced his arrival in the UFC with a crushing one-punch knockout on his octagon debut.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d99842d20302746a8526bf8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
