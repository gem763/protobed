The answer was to use the Automobile Association.'\n\nPictured: An AA telephone box in Brancaster, Norfolk, similar to the one which the Prime Minister would be required to use to authorise a retaliatory nuclear strike\n\nUnder the plan, Whitehall arranged for the Prime Minister's car to be fitted with same radio link the AA used to communicate with their mechanics, which would alert the driver that he needed to reach a public phone box from where Macmillan would call Whitehall.\n\nInitially, it was suggested that government drivers carried four pennies as that was the minimum sum needed in a GPO phone box.\n\nBryan Saunders, private secretary to the Minister of Works, whose responsibilities included the government car pool, wrote to Sir Timothy Bligh, Macmillan's principal private secretary, saying: 'I understand that if an emergency arose while the Prime Minister was on the road, the proposal is to use the radio to get him to a telephone.\n\n'Perhaps we should see that our drivers are provided with four pennies - I should hate to think of you trying to get change for sixpence from a bus conductor while those four minutes were ticking by.'\n\nMacmillan (left, with JFK and, right, with Duncan Sandys MP) had his car fitted with a device that would allow him to call Whitehall in the case of four-minute warnings\n\nSir Timothy came up with an alternative plan to cover for occasions where the driver did not have the necessary change.\n\nHe said: 'In such cases, it is a simple matter to have the cost of any telephone call transferred by dialling 100 and requesting reversal of the charge, and this does not take any appreciable time.'\n\nThe arrangement was approved and, just in time for the 1963 Cuban missile crisis, the AA link was installed. According to Mr Hennessy, it remained in place until early 1970 - a period spanning four prime ministers.\n\nHennessy told the audience the means of communication 'was so English - and so bizarre - that had it appeared in an Ealing Comedy it would have not been believed'.\n\nThe plan followed a secret Whitehall review in 1961 of retaliation procedures should the Soviet Union launch a surprise attack on the West.\n\nIf Macmillan was killed, two other senior ministers were given the power to authorise the deployment of the RAF's V-bombers - named as 'First Gravedigger' and 'Second Gravedigger'.", "description": "The arrangement was developed at the beginning of the 1960s when Lord Mountbatten faced the problem of what to do in a four-minute warning if the PM was not in Downing Street.", "authors": ["Richard Marsden For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/00/19418158-0-image-a-25_1570489817716.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
