Most people would probably equate that with sympathy for the devil.\n\nAnd yet I can\u2019t help but feel a certain amount for Philip Bowcock, whose departure as CEO of William Hill was announced after he\u2019d spent just two-and-half years in post. He\u2019s endured a white-knuckle ride that might have finished off another.\n\nBowcock was hired as finance director by the company towards the end of what looked like a perfectly executive swan dive under his predecessor as CEO James Henderson. He was installed on an acting basis after the latter\u2019s departure in July of 2016, but it was made very clear that he wasn\u2019t high on the shortlist of candidates to permanently replace him.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nQuestions abounded about the business he was left with. At a time when other gambling groups had been indulging in a frenzied bout of deal-making, with Ladbrokes joining forces with Coral, and later GVC, while Betfair cuddled up with Paddy Power, William Hill was left sitting on the shelf.\n\nWorse was to come. A government review of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) and the maximum allowable stake put a number of options on the table.\n\nThe industry knew that the salad days of up to \u00a3100 on each spin of the electronic wheel were over. But most expected the government to opt for a compromise of perhaps \u00a350, or at worst \u00a320, to preserve the lucrative tax revenues they provided.\n\nUnder sustained pressure from Labour, however, ministers opted for the nuclear option of \u00a32, in the process gutting the profits of firms with a substantial betting shop estate like Hill\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to argue with the decision, despite the store closures and job losses that have trailed in its wake. The evidence of the damage they can cause, particularly in poor communities, has been mounting. The betting industry will always be a controversial one, but with FOBTs there was really no debate to be had. It had yoked itself to a deeply harmful product.\n\nWith the hammer having been brought down upon them, betting companies have had to look elsewhere for earnings. Chiefly online and overseas. The legalisation of sports betting in several US states has, in particular, sparked something of a gold rush.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He will be expected to sharpen up the company\u2019s offer, deliver on a new strategy, and breathe some life into a becalmed share price that has lost more than a third of its value since Bowcock was confirmed in the role.\n\nBut in doing so, he will also need to pay due heed to the risks gambling presents to its customers. Take online gaming. The difference between it and FOBTs is largely one of visibility. Walk into a betting shop and it\u2019s impossible to miss the bleeps and the lights of the latter. With the former, it\u2019s quite possible to lose far bigger sums in the privacy of one\u2019s home simply with the aid of a smartphone. It\u2019s a form of gambling on which there are no limits.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of how America will react to the emergence of a generation of problem gamblers down the line. Bengtsson has it all to do.", "description": "Sympathy for a bookie?
