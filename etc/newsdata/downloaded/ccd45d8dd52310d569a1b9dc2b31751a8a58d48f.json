It barks in return and a second Bordeaux mastiff emerges.\n\nRSPCA investigators believe the video was filmed in the UK - due to the number plates of passing vehicles - but it\u2019s unclear where the incident occurred.\n\nThe man is described as white, with fair hair.\n\n(Image: RSPCA)\n\n(Image: RSPCA)\n\nHe was wearing black shiny shoes, black trousers and a white, long-sleeve t-shirt.\n\nAnyone who believes they recognise the dogs, know where this incident took place or has any information on who is responsible should contact the RSPCA appeal line on 0300 123 8018.\"", "description": "The man laughed hysterically when he tricked a giant Bordeaux mastiff for food and slapped the animal in the face", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Rspca"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749469.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RSPCA-appeal-to-find-man-filmed-slapping-dog-around-the-face-in-viral-prank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
