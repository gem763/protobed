The ICC ACU is reliant on players to play a central part in the fight against corruption and I didn\u2019t do my duty in this instance.\n\n\u2018Like the majority of players and fans around the world, I want cricket to be a corruption free sport and I am looking forward to working with the ICC ACU team to support their education programme and ensure young players don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlex Marshall, ICC General Manager \u2013 Integrity said of the ban: \u2018Shakib Al Hasan is a highly experienced international cricketer. He has attended many education sessions and knows his obligations under the Code. He should have reported each of these approaches.\n\n\u2018Shakib has accepted his errors and cooperated fully with the investigation. He has offered to assist the Integrity Unit in future education, to help younger players to learn from his mistakes. I am happy to accept this offer.\u2019\n\nThe ban will keep the all-rounder out of the Indian Premier League, Pakistan Super League and Bangladesh Premier League, all of which he has commitments to.\n\nHe will also miss Bangladesh\u2019s upcoming fixtures against India and the start of the Twenty20 World Cup next year.\n\nMORE: Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani explains decision to sack Sarfaraz Ahmed as captain\n\nMORE: ICC changes Super Over rules after England\u2019s Cricket World Cup win over New Zealand", "description": "Shakib Al Hasan 'completely accepts' his ban from all cricket - lasting two years with one suspended - after breaching the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code.
