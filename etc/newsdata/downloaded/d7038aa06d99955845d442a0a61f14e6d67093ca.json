The page\u2019s pro-Trump messages soared in recent weeks.\n\nThose posts apparently jumped when Trump was pressuring Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate unfounded accusations that former Vice President Joe Biden had attempted to block a corruption probe into a Ukrainian company linked to his son. Trump\u2019s apparent attempt to use his presidential power to harm the Democrat who could face him in 2020 has sparked calls for the president\u2019s impeachment.\n\nOther pages linked to \u201cI Love America\u201d and created in the last few months collectively generated tens of millions of \u201cinteractions\u201d with people who liked, shared or commented on a post, outpacing several of America\u2019s largest news sites, Legum noted.\n\n\u201cI Love America\u201d often recycled memes used by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, which established fake Facebook pages to amass millions of followers and boost Trump in the 2016 election before they were finally shut down.\n\nThe same images that Russia\u2019s IRA posted also appeared on the \u201cI Love America\u201d page. They were often transformed into clickbait \u201cvideos\u201d by using a camera to pan over or zoom in on photos, noted Renee DiResta, a research manager at Stanford University\u2019s Internet Observatory.\n\nAnother thing in here that was interesting was the conversion of IRA memes (among others) to video form. The videos pan or zoom on the meme, then the frame changes to ask audiences to like/share. A number of the videos had substantial engagement. pic.twitter.com/8xiNyXbyqP \u2014 Renee DiResta (@noUpside) September 23, 2019\n\nDiResta noted on Twitter that the posts appeared to be more \u201ccommercial\u201d than government-run, but said she was surprised by the amount of traffic they received.\n\nThe network of pages linked to \u201cI Love America\u201d featured posts on patriotism, Jesus and cute puppies.\n\n3. \"I Love America\" is part of a complex network of Ukrainian-run Facebook pages that seek to amass large audiences and then funnel them to rabidly pro-Trump pages.\n\n\n\nThese include pages featuring cute dogs and Jesushttps://t.co/0MRNxVJbUJ pic.twitter.com/1CSewIkgnh \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) September 23, 2019\n\nA Facebook representative initially told Legum on Sunday that the company would not take down the page \u2014 or others linked to it \u2014 because it didn\u2019t violate the company\u2019s policies, including one barring \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior\u201d to mislead followers.\n\nBut when the story began to circulate Monday, Facebook took action.\n\n\u201cWe are removing these pages for violating our policies against spam and fake accounts and are continuing to investigate for any further violations,\u201d Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborn said in an email to HuffPost.\n\nThe company removed a total of nine pages, including some featuring dogs, Jesus and a page titled \u201cGod Bless Donald Trump and God Bless America,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nFacebook said it had not detected links to a government actor but is continuing its investigation.\n\nDavid Carroll, an associate professor of media design at the New School in New York, tweeted Monday that it was surprising Facebook hadn\u2019t automated the detection of recycled memes from Moscow\u2019s IRA to immediately crack down on copycats who might be following Russia\u2019s playbook.\n\nYou\u2019d think Facebook would have fingerprinted the RU IRA memes to automate their detection when recycled on new pages with huge audiences in the US but operated out of Ukraine. But no. @JuddLegum\u2019s latest discovery is \u201ctroubling\u201d leading up to 2020. https://t.co/A9HBQRvseA \u2014 David Carroll \ud83e\udd85 (@profcarroll) September 23, 2019", "description": "The \u201cI Love America\u201d Facebook page had 1.1 million followers and recycled memes from Russia's notorious Internet Research Agency.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d895ba82100003200db79f8.jpeg?cache=kcbm4ywklj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
