Buterin shared a seemingly snarky analogy:\n\n\u201cMy one-sentence impression of recent quantum supremacy stuff so far is that it is to real quantum computing what hydrogen bombs are to nuclear fusion. Proof that a phenomenon and the capability to extract power from it exist, but still far from directed use toward useful things.\u201d\n\nQuantum supremacy has \u201cBupkis\u201d on Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin evangelist and educator Andreas Antonopoulos echoed similar sentiments towards Google\u2019s quantum computer at the beginning of October, when he said that the threat to Bitcoin by Google\u2019s quantum supremacy is \u201czip, bupkis nada:\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the effect on mining and the cryptocurrency world in general? Zip, bupkis, nada, nothing really happens. Quantum supremacy \u2013 what Google described \u2013 is demonstrating the practical applicability of quantum computers to certain classes of problems. Those classes of problems are not the same class of problem we\u2019re talking about when we talk about breaking cryptography.\u201d\n\nIn theory, quantum computers could vastly speed up the process of solving complex calculations and might therefore pose a real threat to Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work mechanism, as well as blockchain technology at large. Quantum calculations will be endlessly superior to modern cryptography, in such a way that it could reverse cryptocurrency transactions and possibly gain access to private keys.\n\nQuantum breakthrough could improve proof-of-stake\n\nScott Aaronson, a quantum theoretician at the University of Texas at Austin, recently claimed that Google\u2019s quantum computing technology could actually turn out to be a huge help to improve the technology which underpins proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies.
