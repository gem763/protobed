The big risk is that the correlation could flip, and now the longest period of negative correlation in history is coming to an end as policy makers jolt markets with attempts to boost growth.\u201d\n\nBank of America Securities\n\nMeanwhile, higher bond market volatility has lead to U.S. government debt providing worse risk-adjusted return over the last three years than any other asset class other than commodities, while the popularity of bonds has forced investors to take on more risk to get the same yield.\n\n\u201cCrowded positioning means that natural swings in bond prices may be exacerbated as active investors rebalance their holdings or the macro outlook changes,\u201d Harris and Woodard write.\n\nInstead of U.S. government debt, the authors advise investors to add more exposure to equities, particularly stocks with high dividend yields in underperforming sectors, including financials, industrials and materials, which can be bought at inexpensive valuations.\n\n\u201cThe future of asset allocation may look radically different from the recent past,\u201d the wrote, \u201cand it is time to start planning for what comes after the end of 60/40.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday the S&P 500 SPX, +1.00% was about 1% below its record close of 3,025.86 set on July 26, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.89% was around 1.2% below its record finish of 27,359.16 set on July 15, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.24% was around 2.3% away from its record close of 8,330.21 scored on July 26.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.43% rose to 1.754% from 1.748% late Friday. Bond markets were closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday.", "description": "Bank of America strategists say there are reasons to increasingly doubt the safety of bonds", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT364_40_60__ZG_20191015154656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
