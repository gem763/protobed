We\u2019ve got to do something about it. I\u2019m fed up with it. I\u2019m so bored of it,\u201d William said.\n\nDespite saying it felt as though the issue had been brought under control, the prince said recent incidents of abuse had made it feel as though \u201cwe\u2019re back there\u201d.\n\nHendon, who play in the Southern League Premier Division South \u2013 the seventh tier of English football \u2013 work in partnership with the Brent early intervention service to provide access to the club\u2019s training facilities to people facing mental health challenges.\n\nA group of young people have formed the Hendon mental health team and take part in tailored weekly training sessions at the club.\n\nWhile a match went on in the background, William spoke to some of the young men who had benefited from the initiative.\n\nJermaine, 24, a local hospital inpatient, said there had been a \u201cbig change\u201d in his wellbeing since becoming involved with the programme. \u201cI\u2019ve developed a lot physically, mentally and emotionally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s made me more stable and given me more courage to succeed in what I want to do.\u201d\n\nThe prince\u2019s visit is part of efforts to promote the Heads Up campaign, a joint initiative from the FA and the Heads Together charity, which seeks to raise awareness and encourage conversations around mental health, particularly among men.\n\nWilliam said: \u201cHeads Up is about mental health but we are going to start doing stuff on racism as well because it is affecting mental health. Not just the players, but also fans.\u201d\n\nDarren Smith, who uses Hendon\u2019s facilities to run education programmes from the University Campus of Football Business (UCFB), said racism was a huge issue in football.\n\n\u201cIt went quiet, but it never went away,\u201d he said, highlighting the way in which some perpetrators of abuse use anonymous social media accounts to \u201cnot be accountable\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt can\u2019t go untouched, we need to do something about it, because football should be for all, and for certain groups to feel they are not welcome is not right. It has an impact not only on mental health but the aspirations of our young people.\u201d\n\nAsked if he felt the prince took tackling the issue seriously, he said: \u201cIt sounds like he wants to take it further, which is great \u2013 we need more public figures, people with power or positions, to take it forward.\u201d", "description": "Prince calls for action on visit to London football club to discuss mental health outreach", "authors": ["Pa Media", "Dario Brentin", "Danny Gabbidon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a74d45e77103d670a673c777f89dc9f53cc1b543/0_112_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a821ce369ca522a119d92269cf614598", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
