I just wonder after the events of this week, and the fallout we\u2019ve seen, whether you would both feel differently about speaking out in that way in the future?\u201d asked Macfarlane.\n\nAs Breitbart\u2019s Joshua Caplan reported earlier on Thursday:\n\nAn NBA staffer is heard off-camera interjecting that the players are taking \u2018basketball questions only.\u2019 A man is then seen reaching to remove the microphone from the reporter\u2019s hands. \u2018It\u2019s a legitimate question,\u2019 Macfarlane replied. \u2018This is an event that has happened this week.\u2019 \u2018I understand that. It\u2019s a question that\u2019s already been answered,\u2019 the league spokesperson shot back, before reiterating that only basketball questions were allowed.\n\nThe exchange between Macfarlane and the Rockets media relations person was well-circulated on social media. Shortly after, the Rockets issues an apology for the incident, claiming that the Macfarlane\u2019s question should have been allowed.\n\nNBA statement on Rockets not permitting Russell Westbrook & James Harden from answering a question about off the court issues. pic.twitter.com/4GCY83fd5g \u2014 Andrew Marchand (@AndrewMarchand) October 10, 2019\n\nThe incident marks yet another public relations blunder for the league. On Tuesday and Wednesday nights, fans displaying pro-Hong Kong messages at NBA arenas \u2013 in America \u2013 were either removed or had their signs confiscated by stadium security.\n\nAll of this following on the heels of a strong, bipartisan backlash against the league\u2019s initial response regarding Morey\u2019s tweet, in which the league called the offense caused by the pro-democracy message, \u201cregrettable.\u201d\n\nThat response has fueled a week-long controversy that has put the NBA\u2019s standing in China, and America, in varying degrees of doubt.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "The Houston Rockets have apologized for shutting down a CNN reporter's question about the NBA-China controversy, during a Thursday press", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images24-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
