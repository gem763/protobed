(It\u2019s the 17th-highest earning county in the entire nation, according to the latest census data.) But lately, Montgomery County is garnering national attention for something rather different \u2014 a succession of horrific crimes committed by illegal immigrants.\n\nIn the space of only one month, six illegal immigrants have been arrested in the county for different sexual offenses, ranging from molestation to sexual assault at knife-point. One of the alleged victims was as young as 11 years old. The alleged perpetrators are all hail from either El Salvador or Honduras \u2014 and, again, all are here illegally.\n\nMontgomery County officials bear the blame. The county is not officially a \u201csanctuary county,\u201d but on its own official website, Montgomery County states that \u201cas a matter of policy, we do not inquire about anyone\u2019s immigration status to support immigration enforcement, nor do we conduct immigration raids or investigations.\u201d So, close enough. The county has an \u201copen door\u201d policy for illegal immigrants.\n\nIt\u2019s not only a surge in sexual violence that Montgomery County\u2019s indulgent policies toward illegal immigrants is bringing to the formerly pacific area. MS-13, the homicidal Central American gang, is now active in the county, too. Local news outlet WJLA reported recently on the discovery of an MS-13 \u201cdestroyer house,\u201d \u201coutfitted with graffiti, a shrine to the Saint of Death and a miniature skeleton hanging from a ceiling fan.\u201d The upshot is the gang was operating in plain sight out of the hideout in a busy area. MS-13 gang members have committed beatings, murders, and even forced teenagers into prostitution in the county.\n\nSanctuary policies like Montgomery County\u2019s make a mockery of the rule of law. And the dangers aren\u2019t merely theoretical, as the county\u2019s travails over recent months demonstrate.\n\nThere are several hundred sanctuary cities and states across the country. West Coast states California, Oregon and Washington are some of the most hostile to enforcing the country\u2019s immigration laws. The grim results there, too, are plain to see. Immigration and Customers Enforcement (ICE) recently released a list of seven illegal immigrants in the Pacific Northwest who committed violent crimes; all had detainment orders that were ignored by local authorities.\n\nOne Mexican illegal immigrant in Clackamas County, Oregon, for instance, was released by local authorities despite an ICE detainer. He went on to murder his wife. Another illegal immigrant in Washington State allegedly murdered and disremembered his victim mere months after his release by local authorities who too ignored ICE orders.\n\nJeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was (unfortunately) forced out by the president, was a stalwart in his opposition to sanctuary policies. While serving as AG, Mr. Sessions used his available powers at the Justice Department to investigate and ultimately punish those areas that refused to cooperate with federal immigration law. This was the right policy in the name of both public safety and the rule of law. Attorney General William Barr would do well to pursue similar policies that rein in sanctuary cities, counties and states. The safety of the American people, in Montgomery County and across the entire country, depends on it.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
