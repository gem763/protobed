Aptly named the US Space Command, the organization will be run by a four-star general, and it will be responsible for setting the US\u2019s military agenda and doctrine for space in the years to come.\n\n\u201cAs the newest combatant command SPACECOM will defend America\u2019s vital interests in space \u2014 the next warfighting domain,\u201d President Donald Trump said today at a ceremony standing up Space Command. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s pretty obvious to everybody. It\u2019s all about space.\u201d Following Trump\u2019s speech about the merits of Space Command, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper signed documents that formally established the organization. A new flag for the command was also unveiled at the ceremony.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about space.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the US Space Command isn\u2019t actually new. The military once had a Space Command, established back in 1985 after there was a push to focus on space warfighting. It operated for nearly 20 years, but after the September 11th terror attacks, the US wanted to focus more on warfighting in North America. As a result, Space Command got tucked into US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), which is focused on nuclear deterrence. Since then, the military\u2019s space strategy has come out of that combatant command from the Joint Force Space Component Command (JFSCC). But from today onward, the national security space agenda will be decided by a standalone group.\n\nSpace Command is a different entity from Trump\u2019s proposed Space Force. If the Space Force becomes a thing, it\u2019ll be focused on organizing, training, and equipping, or OTE. That means figuring out what kind of space assets need to be made \u2014 such as satellites for surveillance, communication, navigation, and more \u2014 building those satellites, and then training people to operate them. A combatant command, on the other hand, is focused on higher-level warfighting. For space, that entails figuring out how to integrate the use of these satellites into the Department of Defense\u2019s missions. \u201cAll of the combatant commands have all their own war plans,\u201d Brian Weeden, director of program planning for the Secure World Foundation, an organization that promotes sustainable space solutions, tells The Verge. \u201cHow does space fit into those? Space Command is now going to be helping with that.\u201d\n\nThe other big responsibility of the Space Command is to come up with the military\u2019s playbook for space-related scenarios. \u201cThe biggest thing that a combatant command does is it thinks about all the bad things that could happen in its area of control,\u201d says Weeden. \u201cAnd then they put together a plan for how to respond to all of those bad things that can happen.\u201d For instance, if some foreign adversary were to, say, hack a US surveillance satellite, the Space Command would have a detailed checklist for how to respond to such an event. And they would figure out a protocol for who is in charge of handling the situation.\n\n\u201cwhat it does is it creates the conditions for things to change in the future.\u201d\n\nVery little is actually changing, though, except for some bureaucratic reshuffling. The organization is still being run by the same person \u2014 Gen. John Raymond \u2014 except now he doesn\u2019t need to report to the leader of USSTRATCOM. Much of the same personnel who were working on space warfighting within USSTRATCOM are going to be doing the same for US Space Command, too. And while the location of the command\u2019s headquarters has yet to be decided, the two main components of Space Command will be organizations that are already in operation: the Combined Space Operation Center (CSpOC) at Vandenberg Air Force Base, and the National Space Defense Center (NSDC), in Colorado Springs. CSpOC is in charge of enhancing the nation\u2019s space capabilities as well as coordinating the space agenda between the US, international partners, and commercial enterprises. The NSDC is responsible for identifying and warning against threats to the US\u2019s space assets.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s unclear how this resurrection of a separate Space Command will change things. But the fact that space warfighting will be decided by a fully independent organization may mean a sharper focus on national security space issues, says Weeden. \u201cIt\u2019s not actually that different,\u201d he says. \u201cI would say what it does is it creates the conditions for things to change in the future.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the future of the Space Force has yet to be decided. Ultimately, the decision is now in the hands of Congress, which will decide whether to stand up the new military branch and how much money it will receive if so. That decision may come once Congress decides on the next National Defense Authorization Act for 2020.\n\nFor now, the newly minted Space Command will be in full swing, starting today. \u201cJust as we have recognized land, air, sea, and cyber as vital warfighting domains, we will now treat space as an independent region, overseen by a new unified geographic combatant command,\u201d said Trump.", "description": "The Trump administration stood up a new unified combatant command within the military that will be entirely focused on space.
