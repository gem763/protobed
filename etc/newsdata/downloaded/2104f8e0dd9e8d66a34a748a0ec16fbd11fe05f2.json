That is the reason they did not come here,\u201d he said.\n\nPeople have become reluctant to speak out against VBS corruption following the killing of two SA Municipal Workers Union leaders, Ronald Mani and Tshililo Timson Musetsho, who were gunned down in separate incidents earlier this year.\n\nMani and Musetsho received deaths threats for calling on law enforcement agencies to act against those implicated in VBS corruption. They were both employees at the municipality.\n\nAs you can see from the low attendance in this chamber, it is because people are afraid of being killed. That is the reason they did not come here\n\nThe committee\u2019s visit comes during the month that marks a year since the VBS Mutual Bank report titled The Great Bank Heist was released by Advocate Terry Motau, SC.\n\nUsing \u201ca detailed analysis of cash flows\u201d, his report gave a \u201cfar clearer and more accurate picture of the extent of the looting\u201d.\n\nThe Auditor-General of South Africa consolidated general report on the local government audit outcomes financial year 2017/18 further revealed that 16 municipalities invested money with VBS Mutual Bank in the 2016/17 and 2017/18 financial years.\n\nLast week the committee summoned the Makhado, Greater Giyani, Collins Chabane, Vhembe District and Mopani, five of eight Limpopo municipalities which accounted for over 70% of losses suffered as a result of the VBS collapse.\n\nThe committee heard shocking accounts of golden handshakes to high-ranking officials who resigned after the VBS scandal broke.\n\nInstead of being dealt with, they walked away with their full pensions and bonuses, which in one case amounted to over R900 000 for a municipal manager.\n\nREAD: VBS scandal leaves municipalities unable to recover billions\n\nIt also heard how municipal officials took documents authorising a VBS deposit of R120 million to be signed by an official who was bedridden in hospital. It also heard that the loss of funds invested in VBS led to a failure to implement service delivery and other projects, including electrification of villages and water supply.\n\nMamuremi said they wanted action taken against those implicated in the looting and that demands of ordinary people had to be met.\n\nDean Tshenuwani Farisani, representing religious leaders, said the families of Mani and Musetsho were still afraid to take part in meetings organised by the various stakeholders because of how their loved ones were killed.\n\nFarisani lambasted some well-known culprits who took part in the looting frenzy and were using this money from the poor to maintain their lavish lifestyles.\n\nHe said VBS money was used to build mansions for these people, some of whom are very well known.\n\n\u201cSome culprits brag about how they wear R7 000 underwear. Underwear bought with stolen money.\n\n\u201cCan a person who really worked so hard for their money just waste it by buying R7 000 underwear?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIf ever I die today fighting for this truth, keep your cheap \u2018rest in peace\u2019. Just go to your choppers [helicopters] and eat T-bone steaks,\u201d Farisani said.\n\nChief whip and member of the committee Dikeledi Direko said that what was happening in Vhembe was truly sad and the killing of people was something that could not be disregarded.\n\nCulprits could run and hide, but they would eventually be found, she said.\n\n\u2013 Mukurukuru Media", "description": "People who lost thousands of rands in life savings when the bank collapsed last year were allegedly fearful that speaking out against the looters in public could lead to them being killed.", "authors": ["Lucas Ledwaba", "Rolivhuwa Sadiki"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5513/6d28f7907fbf4b56ab8d6eb4c65eee3e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
