Here's what it means.", "language": "en", "text": "A weekend report by The New York Times containing a new sexual-misconduct allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh originally left out a key piece of information.\n\nAdapted from a forthcoming book on Kavanaugh from two Times reporters, the report outlined in its 11th paragraph that Kavanaugh's college classmate Max Stier saw him \"with his pants down\" at a rowdy dorm party \"where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\"\n\nStier contacted senators about the incident and reported it to the FBI, but it did not investigate, the report said.\n\nRead more: A former classmate of Brett Kavanaugh reportedly tipped off the FBI and senators to another allegation of sexual misconduct\n\nOn Sunday evening, The Times added an editors' note with more information about the allegation.\n\nThe note explained that friends of the female student said she couldn't recall the incident and that she declined to be interviewed for the book.\n\nNormally, such a newsworthy bombshell would be near the top of an article, and critics pounced on the paper for the revelation's location and framing.\n\nThe journalist Laura Rozen said it appeared that The Times sought to \"diminish\" its reporting with \"soft cultural context.\"\n\nCritics and defenders of Kavanaugh are using The Times' reporting as ammo in a renewed battle over whether Kavanaugh is fit to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter he was nominated to the high court last year, he faced several allegations of sexual misconduct \u2014 and he was narrowly confirmed, despite emotional testimony from the Stanford University professor Christine Blasey Ford alleging that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her at a party in high school. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.\n\nRead more: Democrats are demanding Brett Kavanaugh's impeachment over a new sexual misconduct allegation\n\nRepublicans are using the clarification do defend Kavanaugh\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday tore into the paper's reporting on Kavanaugh with a barrage of tweets defending him.\n\n\"The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe president followed up with more tweets Monday evening, calling for everyone who was involved in the story to resign, and that The Times is \"DEAD.\"\n\n\"They've taken the Old Grey Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation,\" he added.\n\nOther Republicans also leaped to Kavanaugh's defense. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said on ABC on Sunday that last year's Senate hearings had already reviewed the allegations against Kavanaugh. Cruz also accused Democrats of trying to smear Kavanaugh again.\n\nDemocrats are using the story to call for Kavanaugh's removal from the court\n\nDemocrats, however, latched onto the revelations to push for Kavanaugh's removal from the Supreme Court. Over the weekend, a flurry of 2020 presidential candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, Julian Castro, and Beto O'Rourke, called for his impeachment.\n\nThe Times' handling of the report was heavily scrutinized as well. The paper apologized for a Saturday tweet with the article from its Opinion account that partially read \"Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun.\"\n\n\"This is.... such a profound lapse in judgment and common sense,\" the author Roxane Gay said. \"Sexual assault isn't harmless fun. What the hell is going on at the NYT?\"\n\nThe paper's official communications account also tweeted an explanation about the book's reporting process.", "description": "Kavanaugh's defenders and critics are using The Times' reporting as ammo in a renewed battle over whether he is fit to serve on the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5bb26d0e92b36905d962fffc-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
