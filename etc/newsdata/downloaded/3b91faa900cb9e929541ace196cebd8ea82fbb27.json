Sadly, everything doesn\u2019t use USB-C, which is why I have to carry around a separate pouch of dongles and cables to make sure I can charge all of my gadgets. But the High Five \u2014 a crowdfunded mini-cable that claims to be the \u201cworld\u2018s first 5-in-1 charging cable\u201d \u2014 might be able to help with that.\n\nThe High Five is being made from Vonm\u00e4hlen, a new smartphone accessory company. The cable is actually two cables in one: a USB-C jack with a hybrid Lightning / Micro USB jack, and a regular USB-A jack that has both USB-C and Micro USB inputs on the other.\n\nNeed a USB-C to Lightning or USB-C to Micro USB cable? Just use the first half on its own. USB-A to Lightning or Micro USB? Take the first cable and plug the USB-C jack into the USB-C port on the second piece, and you\u2019ve Frankensteined the cable you need. Likewise, if you want USB-C to USB-A, just flip that setup around by plugging in the Micro USB / Lightning jack into the matching port on the other piece.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done, everything stores together neatly. Just plug the USB-C and Micro USB ends into the half to create a neat loop that can hang on your keys.\n\nThe setup is very hacky, which explains why its\u2019 only rated for a relatively low 2.4A1 charging speed \u2014 things like USB-C PD support or fast charging are definitely out here \u2014 but the High Five seems more like the sort of emergency cable you\u2019d keep with you for a quick charge on the go, not as your primary charger. With that mindset, it seems like a pretty clever idea.\n\nBut there are concerns. The hybrid Lightning / Micro USB plug here almost certainly lacks Apple\u2019s MFi blessing, which may mean that it may not work as well (or it may get blocked by future Apple updates). Adding USB-C into the mix with its own complex set of spec standards isn\u2019t exactly a recipe for confidence.\n\nPlus, High Five is a crowdfunded product. Vonm\u00e4hlen is still in the prototype stage and has yet to start production, which means delays could happen \u2014 especially considering that this is a relatively new company that hasn\u2019t shipped many products.\n\nVonm\u00e4hlen is looking to crowdfund the High Five on Indiegogo and Kickstarter where you\u2019ll be able to pick one up for an early bird discount of 14 euros (roughly $15.91), with shipping promised later this year in May.", "description": "Life would be great if everything used USB-C.
