But even before the new government starts, questions over its longevity began to percolate, given the ideological and policy differences that divide its members.\n\nTalks between the 5 Star and the Democratic Party to iron out differences have progressed since last week, when President Sergio Mattarella asked outgoing Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to lead Italy\u2019s next government.\n\nMr. Conte, a nonparty premier close to the 5 Star, resigned in late August after Mr. Salvini defected. But leaders of the 5 Star, which grew out of grass roots protest against Rome\u2019s established politicians, decided to try for a new coalition with the Democrats, establishment bulwarks.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 5 Star also unveiled a draft of the policy program agreed with the Democrats. The 26-point agenda includes avoiding austerity measures that would hurt growth, introducing an economywide minimum wage, and boosting investments in renewable energy.\n\nThe past month\u2019s political drama in Rome is a symptom of the growing disruption of European politics by insurgent movements such as the nativist League and the ideologically eclectic 5 Star Movement, while volatile electorates seek new answers to problems such as economic stagnation and poorly controlled immigration.\n\nThe 5 Star Movement, which advocates more use of direct democracy, periodically holds votes among its roughly 115,000 members about major decisions, using the party\u2019s online platform, known as \u201cRousseau.\u201d 5 Star leaders said they would have pulled out of talks with the Democrats if their members had rejected such a pact, leaving Mr. Mattarella little option but to dissolve Parliament and call early elections, likely in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a landslide. I think we should all be proud that everybody waited for the decision\u201d of 5 Star activists, said party leader Luigi Di Maio, referring to an online consultation in which 79% of nearly 80,000 votes supported the new government.\n\nThe pact\u2019s approval will allow a new government to take office as soon as this week. The big question is whether such an awkward alliance of establishment and antiestablishment parties would last more than a few months.\n\nThe 5 Star Movement for years disparaged the Democrats, who as part of Italy\u2019s governing coalitions between 2011 and 2018 dealt with the worst of Italy\u2019s financial crisis. The 5 Star blamed the Democrats for many of Italy\u2019s ills, while the Democrats in turn branded 5 Star leaders as amateurish and incompetent.\n\nItaly\u2019s long economic slump turned the 5 Star Movement into one of Europe\u2019s strongest and loudest opponents of the continent\u2019s economic orthodoxy, including the European Union\u2019s strict rules on budget deficits, which have led to painful fiscal retrenchment in Italy and elsewhere. The 5 Star won the vote of one in three Italians in March 2018 national elections.\n\nAllying with the Democrats is \u201ca disavowal of their political discourse of recent years. The 5 Star was born as an ideological opposition to the Democratic Party,\u201d said Franco Pavoncello, a political-science professor at Rome\u2019s John Cabot University.\n\nAlthough the two parties agree on some broad issues, such as defending the welfare state, helping Italy\u2019s disadvantaged south and supporting small businesses, they also have major differences, including on infrastructure projects and immigration, said Daniele Albertazzi, a political scientist at the U.K.\u2019s Birmingham University.\n\nItaly\u2019s draft budget for 2020, which the country must submit to the EU by Oct. 15, poses the first test for a new government. EU rules require Italy to show that it is reducing its high national debt. The 5 Star and Democrats have different instincts on how to proceed, with the former more open to running a larger deficit, and the latter more open to spending cuts.\n\nAnother hot issue will be immigration. During the 14 months that the 5 Star was in government with the League, it supported Mr. Salvini\u2019s policy of closing Italian ports to ships carrying migrants rescued in the Mediterranean. The Democrats attacked that policy as inhumane and illegal.\n\n\u201cA large number of people who still support the 5S like what Salvini says about immigration and security. They don\u2019t want to go back to opening the ports,\u201d Mr. Albertazzi said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge because a lot of PD people want to show they are the opposite of Salvini.\u201d\n\nWrite to Giovanni Legorano at giovanni.legorano@wsj.com", "description": "Italy\u2019s antiestablishment 5 Star Movement voted to form a coalition government with its former center-left Democratic Party antagonists, clearing the last major hurdle to new leadership.", "authors": ["Giovanni Legorano", "Giovanni.Legorano Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103564/social"}
