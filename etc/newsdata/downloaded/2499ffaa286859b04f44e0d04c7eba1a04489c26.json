His surviving son, Cristian Iban Gonzalez (left), presented several neck wounds\n\nM\u00e1rquez added that authorities have been slow to investigate the crimes.\n\nGemma Pomares, Doctors Without Borders' head of medical activities in Tenosique, said through a statement Tuesday that the aid group has treated 11 migrants in recent month who reported being stripped, whipped, beaten and tortured with electric shocks.\n\n'While violence has always been a reality of the migration route north from Guatemala through Mexico, extortion and this level of extreme violence have been more pervasive in dangerous cities closer to the US border, and has not been so prevalent, until now, in southern areas,' Pomares said.\n\nThe aid group said the victims also reported they were forced to watch kidnappers rape other migrants.\n\nDoctors Without Borders believes that Mexico's policies in enforcing the flow of migrants to the United States have driven many 'to go underground and take increasingly dangerous routes.'\n\nThe 'criminalization persecution, detention and deportation of migrants' are driving men, women and children to gangs that operate without being prosecuted.\n\nMore than half the migrants aided by Doctors Without Borders in Mexican border cities across from the United States have reported being kidnapped in the last month.\n\n'It was a just matter of time before the high levels of violence against migrants and refugees that our teams have seen on the northern border, moved to the south of the country,' says Sergio Mart\u00edn, Doctors Without Borders' general coordinator in Mexico.\n\n'What we are seeing are the humanitarian consequences of the tightening of migration policies, designed to inflict greater suffering on the thousands of people desperately escaping for their lives. The lack of protection and the cruelty with which they are being treated is unacceptable.'", "description": "Central American migrants are being kidnapped, beaten and held for ransom in southern Mexico, with gangs demanding contact information of family members living in the US.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Adry Torres For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/14/20379556-0-image-a-2_1572445692260.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
