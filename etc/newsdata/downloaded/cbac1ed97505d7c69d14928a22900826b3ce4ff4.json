It should stop, and stop now,\u201d said leaders of the group at a press conference Sunday in the nation\u2019s capital of Addis Ababa.\n\nThe group has called on the government to adopt stricter laws on the punishment of homosexual activity. At present, Ethiopian anti-sodomy laws stipulate up to 15 years in prison for any homosexual act, but church leaders have said this is insufficient.\n\n\u201cOur culture does not leave room for this type of activity. We have values \u200b\u200bthat are losing their importance because of the proliferation of these practices,\u201d they said.\n\nThe group\u2019s leaders said the government\u2019s indifference has helped to embolden the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) movement in the East African country.\n\nWhile Ethiopia is divided between Christianity and Islam, leaders of both faiths have united in their opposition to homosexual practice.\n\nLast June, religious leaders from different faiths called on their government to take a stand against an American travel agency claiming to be the only gay travel agency in the world, which was advertising visits to Ethiopia\u2019s historic sites.\n\n\u201cThe Ethiopian government should address this matter and play its part in protecting the younger generation from immoral practices, which are contrary to Ethiopian values \u200b\u200band religion,\u201d the religious leaders said.\n\nThe groups were particularly upset that the itinerary offered by the Toto Tours company included religious sites.\n\nSince coming to power, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been advocating political and economic openness, while remaining silent on the question of homosexuality.\n\nMore than half of African nations have laws criminalizing homosexual relations, where many regard homosexuality as a western import. These laws have been targeted by human rights NGOs who push for greater openness to homosexual activity on the continent.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Christian leaders in Ethiopia have denounced the spread of LGBT propaganda, urging the government to defend the nation\u2019s religious values.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
