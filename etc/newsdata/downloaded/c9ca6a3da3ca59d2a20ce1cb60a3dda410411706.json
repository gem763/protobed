We\u2019re discussing her role in ITV\u2019s new six-part, real-life drama A Confession, in which she plays the mother of Becky Godden-Edwards, who was murdered in 2003. It\u2019s distressing to watch, I say. \u201cWell yes, of course it is,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s about two bloody dead daughters.\u201d\n\nThe 63-year-old actor, sitting in a glass-walled room inside ITV\u2019s London studio, has a quietly formidable air. But it requires a staunch character to take on the task of playing Karen Edwards. Her daughter Becky was a lifelong drug addict, and Edwards tried repeatedly to help her get clean. In one particularly harrowing flashback scene, we see Becky spit in her mother\u2019s face during a forcible drug detox. When Becky went missing, Karen searched doggedly for years before her daughter\u2019s body was discovered. She had been murdered by taxi driver Christopher Halliwell (played with eerie calm by Joe Absolom).\n\nDespite leading police directly to where she was buried \u2013 \u201cDo you want another one?\u201d Halliwell said, after admitting to the murder of another young woman, Sian O\u2019Callaghan in March 2011 \u2013 the killer\u2019s confession was deemed inadmissible, because the police officer in charge had failed to caution him (Halliwell was eventually found guilty of Becky\u2019s murder at a trial in 2016). That officer, Steve Fulcher, played by Martin Freeman, was accused of gross misconduct and forced to resign. A Confession brutally and painstakingly dramatises the controversy.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

None of us are doing impressions of anyone, but I just wanted to sense her essence and her energy and the sort of person she is. Karen\u2019s got a wonderful suit of armour. She\u2019s terribly strong. Her daughter\u2019s life wasn\u2019t easy before her death.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, she kept to herself during the shoot. \u201cI don\u2019t laugh around and chat a lot when I\u2019m doing those scenes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not there to entertain the crew, I\u2019m there to do my job. Whereas on Vera Drake, for months and months, we were just living as this sort of family.\u201d\n\nStaunton was nominated for an Oscar for her role in that extraordinary 2004 film. She gives a devastating, understated performance as the title character, a working-class woman who provides young women with free, illegal abortions at great personal cost. The film\u2019s director, Mike Leigh, has a famously intense improvisational process; none of Staunton\u2019s cast mates knew the truth about her character until several months in. She had been sworn to secrecy. \u201cThere\u2019s a scene where I\u2019m arrested,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that it would happen. I felt like I was having a heart attack. That day was something none of us will ever forget \u2013 the intensity, the fear, the upset and the shock.\u201d\n\nFor Staunton, the experience of making that film far surpassed the glitz and glamour of the Academy Awards. \u201cI was 48, my head wasn\u2019t going to be turned by anything at all. The louder they get, the quieter I get. I just find it all\u2026\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cYou just think, \u2018Oh, shut up!\u2019 They\u2019re shouting, \u2018Is this the most exciting day of your life?\u2019\u201d she adds, adopting an unflattering American accent. \u201cObviously it\u2019s the most exciting day of your life, because you\u2019ve gone bonkers. So yeah, it was lovely, it was great, we had a wonderful time, but it was mixed for me. Also, my mum had died suddenly, and I didn\u2019t tell the press or anything. So it wasn\u2019t a joyous thing. My mum died, and that was a shock, and then I just had to carry on and do all the rounds.\u201d\n\nEven without the added burden of grief, it always seems supremely stressful to be photographed by hundreds of paparazzi on a red carpet. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d says Staunton. \u201cThey go, \u2018IMELDA!\u2019 They ask all those poor girls who are in those dresses, \u2018Right turn around, turn around, look back, look back.\u2019 You want to go, \u2018Just take the picture.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s a limit to her sympathy, though. \u201cFor women now, I think, \u2018Stop wearing those dresses, girls.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what the pressure is on serious actresses to wear those clothes. Come on ladies, we\u2019re trying to move it on, so maybe don\u2019t wear that figure-hugging thing. But then, they want to be able to say that\u2019s what they want to wear. It is tricky. That\u2019s one night of your life. It\u2019s fine as long as you don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nStaunton would much rather just stick to her day job, and then go home to her family. She\u2019s married to Downton Abbey star Jim Carter, and has a daughter Bessie, who\u2019s in her 20s. \u201cI avoid the showbiz glare. I like to just get on with my life,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter work, I don\u2019t want to then have to dress up and be with people talking about the job I do. No, I just do the job and then I go home and do my shopping and my cooking. There\u2019s no doubt that that other side of the business has increased a million-fold. It\u2019s all just noise and fluff and filler. The word celebrity makes me feel sick when it\u2019s applied to me, because I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a jobbing actor. That\u2019s really all I want to do, and I don\u2019t know what all that other stuff\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But it is on stage that she has climbed to the very highest echelons, winning multiple Olivier Awards for musicals such as Into The Woods, Guys and Dolls, Sweeney Todd, Gypsy and, most recently, for her heartbreaking turn in Follies.\n\nI tell her how much I loved Follies, which I saw just before ageing out of the National Theatre\u2019s cheap ticket deal for under-25s. These days, I go to the theatre less, I admit. \u201cSo what else would you spend your money on?\u201d she asks. Oh. Um. \u201cIf you like the theatre, just think, \u2018Well I won\u2019t have that. I\u2019ll put that money towards the theatre.\u2019 Put some money away every week, just two pounds or five pounds a week.\u201d Right. I suppose I\u2019ll give that a go.\n\n\u201cA lot more young people are going to the theatre now,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot more different theatres. My daughter goes to loads, so I think it\u2019s available. It surprises me that people go on about the cost of theatre, and yet a family will still go and see The Lion King. That\u2019s going to set them back \u00a3400. If they couldn\u2019t afford it, they wouldn\u2019t be going, so it wouldn\u2019t be there. But obviously, there are people who can afford it. Football matches cost a lot of money. I think more than that, it needs to be diverse, and having plays written by different people, not just the same few people.\u201d\n\nOn that part, at least, we can agree. For one thing, in Staunton\u2019s view, that might lead to the creation of more female characters who are imperfect, even unlikeable. Her character Mama Rose, in the Sondheim musical Gypsy, is a domineering stage mother who tried to live vicariously through her daughters. Staunton once said that it was only because Rose was a woman that she was simply perceived as a monster.\n\n\u201cUnlikeable people, they\u2019re good characters, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re flawed. And flawed people are much more interesting.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Confession\u2019 starts at 9pm on Monday on ITV1", "description": "Not for the last time today, Imelda Staunton is telling me off.
