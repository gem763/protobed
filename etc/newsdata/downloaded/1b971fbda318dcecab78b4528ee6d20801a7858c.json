Darth Vader\u2019s voice was provided by actor James Earl Jones.\n\n\u201cAnything from the original trilogy is exceedingly difficult to find,\u201d said Brian Chanes, head of consignor relations at Profiles in History.\n\nThe current top price for any \u201cStar Wars\u201d memorabilia is held by the 35mm camera used by director George Lucas to film the first, 1977 \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie. It fetched $625,000 at a 2011 auction in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nA pair of the round, wire-framed glasses won by a young Daniel Radcliffe in the first \u201cHarry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\u201d in 2001 is expected to sell for around $30,000.\n\n\u201cThese are screen-worn production glasses and they actually have chew marks on the back. He (Radcliffe) was fiddling with them on set,\u201d said Chanes. \u201cInstantly recognizable, and that\u2019s what people look for.\u201d\n\nActor Sean Connery\u2019s moon buggy from the 1971 James Bond movie \u201cDiamonds are Forever,\u201d has a high estimate of $600,000.\n\nThe \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d outfit is a black and white pinafore dress worn by Judy Garland\u2019s double in the 1939 film and is estimated to fetch between $350,000 and $500,000. Garland\u2019s screen-worn blue gingham pinafore dress sold for $1.5 million in 2015.\n\nThe 940-lot auction also includes items from \u201cAlien,\u201d \u201cKing Kong,\u201d \u201cStar Trek\u201d and \u201cMoonraker\u201d and will take place in Los Angeles on Sept. 25 and 26. It is expected to fetch a total of about $10 million.", "description": "A rare Darth Vader mask and helmet worn in one of the early \"Star Wars\" movies goes up for auction in Los Angeles later this month, along with a pair of Harry Potter's signature glasses.", "authors": ["Rollo Ross", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
