The \"Rainbow Choir\", made up of LGBTI singers, staged a protest against their exclusion from the international families event.\n\nOrganisers of this weekend's demonstrations have called for the pontiff to acknowledge that the Vatican wilfully hid crimes committed by members of the clergy to protect the Church.\n\nIreland\u2019s prime minister has called on the Catholic Church to introduce mandatory reporting for clerical sex abuse. Leo Varadkar said concrete actions needed to follow the Pope\u2019s recent letter to the world\u2019s Catholics, in which he called for an end to cover-ups.\n\nDublin\u2019s Archbishop Diarmuid Martin said in his Sunday homily ahead of the visit, that he hoped Francis would speak frankly about the \u201cdarkness\u201d of clergy abuse.\n\nReports of abuse in Ireland\u2019s Catholic institutions go back years. The country was rocked by revelations over church-run homes where unmarried mothers underwent horrific treatment. Babies were forcibly taken from them to be given for adoption. Some years ago an unmarked grave was found containing the remains of hundreds of babies.\n\nThe situation today is a world away from the last papal visit, nearly 40 years ago. In 1979 well over two and a half million people came out to welcome John Paul II \u2013 almost half the population of the island of Ireland.\n\nBack then, almost nine in ten Catholics went to weekly Mass, and homosexuality and divorce were illegal.\n\nToday, Ireland has a gay prime minister and has voted for same-sex marriage and to overturn the ban on abortion.\n\nThe Catholic Church is divided on whether to move with social change, or to stick to its traditional teaching \u2013 and in some quarters the current pope\u2019s message is seen as inconsistent.\n\nPope Francis faces a major challenge in seeking to reconcile the different views, at a time when for many the Church has lost its moral authority.", "description": "The first visit by a pope to Ireland in nearly 40 years comes as the Catholic Church is rocked by scandals over clergy child sex abuse and cover-ups.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/28/47/94/1000x563_cmsv2_ffb477bf-b9f3-5954-9671-9f350956b6f0-3284794.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-24"}
