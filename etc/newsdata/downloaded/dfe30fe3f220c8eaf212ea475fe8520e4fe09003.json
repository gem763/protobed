How will Browns QB respond?", "language": "en", "text": "It has gotten so bad for Baker Mayfield that the three losses (against two wins), the eight picks (against four touchdowns) and the 16 sacks (with three fumbles) isn\u2019t even the most obvious sign of his currently falling football star.\n\nIt\u2019s gotten so bad for Baker Mayfield that Richard Sherman, of all people, can make up some story about how Mayfield didn\u2019t shake hands pregame and wasn\u2019t displaying proper football \u201cetiquette\u201d \u2026 and lots of people will run with it because it confirms their pre-existing opinions of Baker Mayfield.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing, and annoying, was him not shaking hands at the beginning,\u201d Sherman told NFL.com. \u201cThat\u2019s some college s- - -. It\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019re all trying to get psyched up, but shaking hands with your opponent \u2013 that\u2019s NFL etiquette. And when you pull bush league stuff, that\u2019s disrespectful to the game He hasn\u2019t earned anything in this league.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAnd so on.\n\nMind you, Sherman made up that non-handshake story despite it occurring at midfield of a huge stadium during a national televised game.\n\nThey actually shook hands.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\nThen, when video predictably emerged that showed Mayfield indeed shaking Sherman\u2019s hand, Sherman just doubled down by declaring on Twitter that it was a \u201cpetty shake\u201d and, well, who knows or cares what else.\n\nSo Richard Sherman claims Baker Mayfield refused to shake his hand at the coin toss. This video seems to indicate otherwise: pic.twitter.com/4CgOsLKLPL \u2014 Jake Trotter (@Jake_Trotter) October 8, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s how bad it has gotten for Baker Mayfield, who five weeks into his second season in the NFL is a long way from standing shirtless between a Rolls Royce and a tiger, hawking underwear.\n\nThat was the offseason, which included bold quotes in magazines, short odds on the Super Bowl and lots of television commercials.\n\nThis is the reckoning. Sherman calling him unsportsmanlike. Nick Bosa pretending to plant a flag in the field to troll Mayfield for the time he trolled Bosa and Ohio State in college. The offense looking like a general mess, despite the array of weapons that surround him (Odell Beckham Jr., Jarvis Landry, Nick Chubb).\n\n\u201cSome of it has to do with the lack of protection,\u201d coach Freddie Kitchens, the rookie head coach who certainly hasn\u2019t helped much, said Tuesday. \u201cSome of it had to do with a couple of bad throws, a couple of bad decisions. Overall, we had some drops. You can\u2019t do those things and play the quarterback position at an elite level. If you just want the honest answer, you have to have consistency around you, you have to be consistent yourself and none of that happened [in a 31-3 loss to San Francisco].\u201d\n\nAs a result, it seems the entire league, plenty of fans and innumerable media are rooting for Mayfield\u2019s comeuppance. Nothing like becoming the NFL\u2019s new heel.\n\nThe question is: Where does he go from here?\n\nBaker Mayfield has been sacked 16 times this season. Last year he went down 25 times in 14 games (AP)\n\nIt isn\u2019t going to be easy.\n\nMayfield needs to be better. The offense needs to be better. Kitchens needs to be better.\n\nYet up next is Seattle, an off week and then New England. The Browns could start 2-5 and its imperative for Mayfield that even if that happens, he somehow retains his confidence in himself and his teammates confidence in him to continue to push forward.\n\nThe AFC North is still winnable, the schedule eventually gets easier and, well, it\u2019s too early for the wheels to completely fall off. Or it should be.\n\nThe risk of taking on all that attention \u2013 interviews, commercials and magazine spreads \u2013 isn\u2019t so much what it can do to the player. Mayfield may still be working as hard as ever. It\u2019s also what it can do to opponents, who put a bull\u2019s-eye on the young gun who inspires extra motivation, extra spite, extra everything.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t earned anything in this league,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cHow many games has he won? He\u2019s acting like he was the MVP last year. If [Patrick] Mahomes did that, it would be one thing. But he would never do that, because he has too much respect for the game.\n\n\u201cAnd when you see a guy who doesn\u2019t? You humble him every chance you get,\u201d Sherman continued. \u201cBecause eventually, he will have respect for the league \u2013 or he\u2019ll be out of it.\u201d\n\nSherman\u2019s claims about the pregame handshake may have been inaccurate, but the emotion behind his interest in destroying Mayfield any way he can is true. And he isn\u2019t the only one feeling it.\n\n\u201cI think different people find motivation from different things,\u201d Kitchens said when asked Tuesday if Mayfield\u2019s personality was firing opponents up. \u201cI think, ultimately, it is what we do on the field, not off the field in that type of setting that matters. Ultimately, we go to the game with the plan, and if we execute the plan, we are usually successful. \u2026 It has nothing to do with things off the field like that. It is all about how you play the game.\u201d\n\nCan Mayfield play this game? He was 8-for-22 for 100 yards with two picks, and had four sacks and two fumbles Monday night. It wasn\u2019t all his fault, but in the end the QB is the QB.\n\nHe has, thus far this season, regressed in nearly every statistical category from when he was a rookie.\n\nMayfield is a self-made man. He was a walk-on who started as a true freshman at Texas Tech. After starting anew at Oklahoma he wound up winning the Heisman and going No. 1 overall in the draft.\n\nHe led Cleveland to some dramatic late-season victories a year ago and has inspired a forlorn franchise to believe in itself.\n\nNow he has to get better, a lot better, and quickly. Seattle next. New England coming. The NFL world seemingly against him. It\u2019s time for Mayfield to show what he is \u2026 the real deal or just another wild story Richard Sherman will tell someday.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Sherman\u2019s claims about the handshake may have been inaccurate, but the emotion behind his interest in destroying Mayfield is true.
