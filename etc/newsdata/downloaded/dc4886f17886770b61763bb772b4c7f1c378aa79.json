Their picture is improving as manufacturers step up the quality with advances such as quantum dots, which add color and brightness. OLEDs, which use organic material allowing each pixel to light up individually, will always have the better picture \u2014 and a higher price to match.\n\nAD\n\nFor someone who wants the ultimate movie or sports experience, with brighter brights and darker darks, OLEDs are best. \u201cI have both types of TVs at home,\u201d says Jason Sigritz of Columbus, Ohio, an in-home adviser for Best Buy, \u201cand I catch myself always wanting to watch the OLED.\u201d\n\nScreen resolution\n\nMost TVs sold today that are larger than 40 inches have 4K resolution, which means four times the old standard of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels, or 3,840 by 2,160 pixels, says Will Greenwald, PCMag\u2019s home entertainment editor and senior electronics analyst for TVs. That\u2019s four times the detail than just a few years ago.\n\nAD\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean all the content you want to watch will be available in 4K, but a 4K TV will \u201csignificantly improve\u201d picture quality, Sigritz says. \u201cWith a 4K TV, whatever you\u2019re watching \u2014 Blu-ray, DVD, streaming content or cable/satellite broadcast \u2014 will be much sharper, clearer and better than a standard HD TV due to upscaling technology.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTVs with 8K resolution are just starting to enter the market, with a resolution four times the number of pixels of 4K (yes, the math is confusing). \u201cThey\u2019re strictly for early adopters,\u201d he warns, \u201cand there is no 8K content available for consumers to watch on them yet.\u201d They will be a viable option around 2022.\n\nScreen size\n\n\u201cGenerally, you can comfortably sit as close as around 100 percent the diagonal measurement of your 4K TV,\u201d Greenwald says. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting five feet away, a 55-inch TV is good. Eight feet, maybe 65-inch.\u201d On a media cabinet or console, go for a TV that is slightly smaller than the unit. \u201cFor example, a 65-inch TV feels a bit large for a 57-inch console, but looks much more balanced on an 80-inch console,\u201d says Alessandra Wood, vice president of style at Modsy, an interior home design service in San Francisco. For bedrooms, \u201c43 inches is large enough to see from bed but small enough to sit on a dresser without taking up too much space,\u201d she says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHDR\n\nHDR, or high dynamic range, means the TV can show a wider range of color than older models, \u201cto provide a picture that\u2019s more lifelike,\u201d says Sigritz, who recommends looking for an HDR TV for the best viewing experience. \u201cIt\u2019s like we had that eight-pack of crayons and we went up to the 24-pack of crayons.\u201d\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services are making sure that when they offer 4K content, it\u2019s also in HDR. This is usually called HDR10, which is what movie studios and TV companies have agreed on for the HDR standard. Note, though, that different companies offer enhancements on HDR: Dolby Vision is one (used by Sony, LG and Vizio) and HDR10+ is another (used by Samsung and Panasonic). Although standard HDR sets the light vs. dark for a whole movie, for example, Dolby and HDR10+ allow the light to change by scene \u2014 dark scenes are darker and light scenes are lighter, as directors intended \u2014 making it more lifelike.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRefresh rate\n\nThe ideal refresh rate \u2014 or rate at which the picture refreshes \u2014 depends on the type of content you want to watch, Sigritz says. At the standard rate, the picture is refreshed 60 times per second, or 60 Hertz (Hz). \u201cWe want a TV that has 120 Hz as our minimum,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that when a football goes flying across the screen, or there\u2019s a car chase in a movie, it\u2019s not blurry and fuzzy.\u201d Some manufacturers are even offering 240 Hz, which is the clearest with motion.\n\nHDMI connections\n\nWe used to have four or five spaghetti-like cords that would hook up each device, Sigritz says. Now, with HDMI cords, each device has only one cord, \u201cbut we want to make sure that we have enough for all of our devices,\u201d he says. Think about how many devices you want to attach to your TV and then count the HDMI ports. Hookup options include: sound bar, streaming box, game system, Blu-ray device, cable box.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrices\n\nBest Buy breaks TVs into three categories: standard, premium and elite, with a standard being a 4K HDR and elite being one of the OLED offerings. \u201cBasically, you can get a great deal for under $1,000, and if you\u2019re willing to really splurge on style and performance, you can expect to spend around $3,000,\u201d PCMag\u2019s Greenwald says. David Dritsas, an electronics retail expert for U.S. Virgin Islands-based Brad\u2019s Deals, says there are many good 4K TVs in the $500 range.\n\nWhen to buy\n\nThe best time of year to buy a new TV is the holiday season, from Black Friday through December, Dritsas says. Do your research on the TV you want and the price before looking for sales so you\u2019ll know a good deal when you see it. Another good time is late February and March, he says, because \u201cTV manufacturers start to release new products and discount older models.\u201d The best way to know whether a TV is a good deal? \u201cLook at the picture in person,\u201d he says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBest Buy\u2019s Sigritz agrees, because not all 4K HDRs are the same. \u201cA 4K TV is kind of like having a V6 engine in your car, but all that means is you have a V6 engine,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of different types, and some are better than others.\u201d\n\nSound bars\n\nTVs come with tiny speakers, causing well-known phenomenon: We turn up the volume for a quiet scene and then race to find the remote when an explosion blasts. The solution is a sound bar. As TVs got smaller and thinner, it\u2019s almost as if they eventually got so thin that \u201cthe speakers fell out and became a sound bar,\u201d Sigritz says. Sound bars bring the dialogue forward, and many will have a subwoofer to help the viewer experience an exciting scene without having to turn up the volume so high the neighbors complain.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cConsider a sound bar or speaker system to supplement your TV audio if you want an immersive viewing experience,\u201d Greenwald says.\n\nAD\n\nMany manufacturers will offer deals when you buy the TV and sound bar at the same time.\n\nHanging the TV\n\nIn general, you want to make sure that the midline of the TV is at your eye line when sitting, Wood advises, unless you\u2019re hanging it above a mantel; in that situation, hang it like you would a piece of art with an even border of wall space around it. For a clean look, make sure there\u2019s an outlet and a cable jack behind the TV. If you need help hanging, many electronics stores offer such services.\n\nSigritz\u2019s tip: Use a television mount larger than necessary in case you buy a larger TV down the road.\n\nAD\n\nPrivacy\n\nLastly, a note about keeping others out of your business. \u201cPrivacy is always a concern for connected electronics,\u201d Greenwald says. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching streaming content, it\u2019s likely being tracked in some way.\u201d How that information is used varies widely, he adds, so have the same awareness as you would any other electronic media consumption, whether you\u2019re using your phone, tablet, computer or game system.\n\nAD\n\nPrivacy on connected electronics starts with having a secure password on your WiFi home network.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly equated LCD and QLED and listed the wrong city for Brad\u2019s Deals.
