Though the center of the storm is unlikely to turn left toward land, much of southeastern Virginia and the Delmarva Peninsula will be lashed on Friday with tropical-storm-force winds, and the same is expected to hit the southeastern corner of Massachusetts, including Nantucket, Martha\u2019s Vineyard and parts of Cape Cod, by Saturday, forecasters said.\n\nTropical storm warnings have been posted from North Carolina all the way to Fenwick Island, Del., as well as for Chesapeake Bay south of Drum Point, Md., and the tidal portions of the Potomac River. In Massachusetts, the warnings are up for the southern coast, from Woods Hole to Sagamore Beach, and for the islands.\n\nA North Carolina church is translating emergency updates into Spanish.\n\nIn a dimly lit church in Wilmington late on Thursday night, Fernando Lopez monitored Hurricane Dorian as coffee brewed and children played tic-tac-toe.\n\nFor several days this week, Mr. Lopez and other leaders of the First Brigade U.S. Christian Church had lived inside the church, watching updates from local governments, storm chasers and television stations and translating them into Spanish for the Hispanic ministry\u2019s followers.\n\nThe church leaders have posted dozens of times each day on Facebook and fielded calls from nearby residents asking whether they should stay or leave. They also opened their doors to residents who fled their homes and were sleeping at the church on Thursday night.\n\nThe updates \u2014 which range from shelter locations to tornado warnings \u2014 could be vital for Spanish-speaking residents. Many of the notifications from the City of Wilmington and New Hanover County are only in English.", "description": "The Category 1 storm pounded the North Carolina coast with rain early Friday, as hurricane-force winds battered parts of the state\u2019s Outer Banks.", "authors": ["Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/us/05vid-briefing01/05vid-briefing01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
