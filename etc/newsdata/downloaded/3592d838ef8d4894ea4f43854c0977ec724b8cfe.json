Yes, The Rules Expose It For Not Being About Equality At All.", "language": "en", "text": "The Left will make you care. That\u2019s one thing Erick Erickson and others have noted about our ongoing war with liberal America. Even for those who don\u2019t want to be political, these cretins will find a way to get you into the fight. Nothing is off-limits. Everything is a target and there is no sanctuary. The neutrality of Switzerland doctrine has been nuked. How bad has it become? Board games are now a front in the political correctness assault. There\u2019s a feminist monopoly. Yeah, you read that right. You\u2019d think a feminist monopoly would be one that promoted equality, right? Nope. The game pays its female players more, which totally contradicts the namesake, I guess. So, brace yourselves, folks; Ms. Monopoly is coming (via RedState):\n\nIn a move that supposedly will empower women and is not in any fashion whatsoever pandering, it has been announced that a new version of the generationally popular board game MONOPOLY is getting a makeover (unless, it is sexist to say so\u2026) The new version is being dubbed \u201cMs. Monopoly\u2019, and there will be new rules. [\u2026] The most notable change is that when women pass GO they will receive a 20% increase over the male players, receiving $240.00 each time they pass, while men are paid at the standard $200 limit. In addition, other changes will be seen, such as instead of buying properties you will be buying inventions created by women. [\u2026] \u2026the message to young females is they need to have a built-in advantage in order to succeed, with them having to deal with the resentment when they end up winning. It would be deeply instructive if one of those businesses that players could invest in was the Handsome Her Bakery. This was the Australian eatery that made global headlines when it was going to charge male customers eighteen percent more than women \u2014 and promptly went out of business. There is your teachable roll of the dice.\n\nI mean, if I ever play this game with my nieces, I\u2019ll just take $300 on pass go. Why? Well, I\u2019m a person of color. It\u2019s affirmative action. It\u2019s reparations. Hey, I don\u2019t like it. I think all of these politically correct talking points are garbage, but I\u2019ll play by the Left\u2019s rules here with Ms. Monopoly.\n\nH/T RedState", "description": ".09/10/2019 19:27:40PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/314/c29de90c-5e02-4ab1-a1cb-5b0a18e7ed14.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
