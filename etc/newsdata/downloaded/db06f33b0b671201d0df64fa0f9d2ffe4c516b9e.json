William McRaven, a Navy SEAL who oversaw the raid that took out al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in 2011, gave a bleak assessment of President Donald Trump and alleged the commander in chief was gutting the country of the \"nation's principles.\"\n\nIn his fiercest condemnation of the president yet, McRaven recounted in a New York Times opinion column, titled \"Our Republic Is Under Attack From the President,\" a military ceremony he recently attended at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he reflected upon the thousands of US service members who marched on the parade field before him.\n\n\"For everyone who ever served in uniform, or in the intelligence community, for those diplomats who voice the nation's principles, for the first responders, for the tellers of truth and the millions of American citizens who were raised believing in American values \u2014 you would have seen your reflection in the faces of those we honored last week,\" McRaven wrote.\n\nBut \"beneath the outward sense of hope and duty,\" McRaven wrote that \"there was an underlying current of frustration, humiliation, anger and fear.\"\n\nRead more: 'You have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children': Navy SEAL who oversaw the Osama bin Laden raid rebukes Trump\n\nDonald Trump military More\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nMcRaven said that despite the apolitical nature of various military branches, intelligence agencies, and public-service organizations, the people employed by these groups had witnessed \"the assaults on our institutions\" under the Trump administration.\n\n\"They have seen our leaders stand beside despots and strongmen, preferring their government narrative to our own,\" McRaven wrote. \"They have seen us abandon our allies and have heard the shouts of betrayal from the battlefield. As I stood on the parade field at Fort Bragg, one retired four-star general, grabbed my arm, shook me and shouted, 'I don't like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!'\"\n\n\"Those words echoed with me throughout the week,\" McRaven added.\n\nMcRaven pointed out what he said were examples of the US neglecting its duty to be the \"the protectors of the less fortunate\" \u2014 including Trump's recent decision to withdraw troops from Syria as Turkish-backed militants wage assaults against the once US-backed Kurdish militia.\n\nTrump's decision for a withdrawal drew bipartisan condemnation, with many lawmakers alleging the US was abandoning its allies against ISIS. About 11,000 Kurds died during the anti-ISIS campaign, and the abrupt decision for the US to leave the region caught lawmakers and US military officials by surprise.\n\n\"If our promises are meaningless, how will our allies ever trust us? If we can't have faith in our nation's principles, why would the men and women of this nation join the military,\" McRaven said in his column. \"And if they don't join, who will protect us? If we are not the champions of the good and the right, then who will follow us? And if no one follows us \u2014 where will the world end up?\"\n\nRead more: Navy SEAL officer who oversaw the Bin Laden raid suggests Trump could learn about 'integrity' from Obama and Bush\n\nMattis and McRaven SEAL Navy Marine Corps More", "description": "The retired Navy SEAL William McRaven said a retired general told him, \"'I don't like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!'\"", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YvbGjNDMCkLONjdNiKEwng--~B/aD01MDA7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/ed9bd0983809441fce17cd6ffef26a68", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
