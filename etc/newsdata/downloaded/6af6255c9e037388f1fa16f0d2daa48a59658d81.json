They had already missed out on Iceland, the trip\u2019s main attraction. By Monday, a week and a half in, travelers were gathered with their bags and cameras, looking forward to being on land again in Scotland.\n\nAs the 2,018-passenger vessel neared shore, according to two passengers, a voice came over the public-address system announcing that weather would prevent it from making yet another stop.\n\n\"That\u2019s when the riots broke out on the ship,\u201d says Cody McNutt, 31, of Denver, who was onboard with his girlfriend and family members.\n\n\u201cThere was an instant uproar,\u201d his girlfriend, Katasha Jones, says. \u201cThe tension leading up to the announcement was palpable and then it just exploded, and people just went over the edge.\u201d\n\nWe were on an NCL cruise ship, Norwegian Spirit for a 4 countries 9 ports destination. We embarked from Southampton and... Posted by Snowy Dey on Monday, October 7, 2019\n\nWhat followed was a prolonged protest as passengers shouted demands for a refund, held up homemade signs, called crew members liars and asked to go back to London to get off the ship. The revolt lasted for hours, Jones and McNutt said.\n\n\u201cNo one was violent, and I think people were as respectful as they could be with as upset as they were,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAt a certain point, you can\u2019t blame people for being upset. At a certain point, you just lose it.\u201d\n\n[Thousands of vacations canceled after mechanical failure on Norwegian Cruise Line ship]\n\nMcNutt said workers onboard told passengers to call the company\u2019s headquarters in Miami. He said he tried and was told to speak to the guest-services department on the ship.\n\n\u201cA refund is nice, and that would be great, but I really want the CEO or somebody to apologize for what they\u2019re doing to people,\u201d he says.\n\nIn a statement, the Miami-based cruise line said the ship\u2019s itinerary was disrupted due to \u201csevere weather conditions\u201d and the ship was only able to call on eight ports rather than the scheduled nine. Norwegian did not say how many of those ports were substitutions.\n\n\u201cWe understand that it is disheartening when we are unable to call on ports that our guests have been looking forward to visiting,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, we do ask for our guests\u2019 patience, cooperation and understanding that severe weather conditions are an act of God and cannot be controlled, influenced or remediated by the cruise line. Our goal is to showcase the beautiful destinations our ships visit and to provide guests with an onboard experience that is second to none.\u201d\n\nThe statement apologized for passengers\u2019 inconvenience and disappointment, but did not address the protests.\n\n\u201cWe always do our best to provide our guests with a truly enjoyable and memorable vacation, but our very first priority is to ensure their safety and the safety of our crew,\u201d the company said.\n\nA photo of a letter dated Oct. 7 showed that the company was offering passengers a 25 percent discount on future trips \u201cto demonstrate our gratitude for your patience.\u201d\n\nNCL ruins holiday and offers passengers 25% off our next cruise after the captain is booed out of the lobby. pic.twitter.com/FCMJNwpGLX \u2014 NCLHELL (@NCLHELL1) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cThat set everyone off again,\u201d McNutt says. \u201cNone of us want to get on their ships ever again.\u201d He said the toilet in his room stopped flushing, and Jones said she encountered a public toilet that did not work as well. They said they smelled sewage early in the morning.\n\nAfter boarding the ship Sept. 27, McNutt and Jones left early. The cruise is set to end Friday in Southampton, England, but the pair got off Tuesday during a planned stop in Belfast, Ireland. They took a train to Dublin and started their journey home, with a layover in the one place they had really wanted to see.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only two on the ship that are actually going to get to go to Iceland,\u201d McNutt said Wednesday.\n\nColleen McDaniel, editor-in-chief of the review and news site Cruise Critic, said in an email that minor itinerary changes aren\u2019t out of the ordinary, especially during hurricane season. And, she said, strict cruise line contracts give operators the right to change their plans whenever necessary.\n\n\u201cWhen itinerary changes happen, we do tend to see disappointment from guests. But for the most part, cruisers understand that these changes can happen and are usually a result of the lines dealing with situations outside of their control,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring hurricane season, we\u2019ve seen complete itineraries swapped \u2014 sometimes Caribbean cruises are redeployed to New England to avoid storms, for instance.\n\n\"It\u2019s never an ideal situation, and we do hear disappointment, but it\u2019s a result of unsafe conditions and cruise lines reacting so as to keep passengers as safe as possible.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nIs cruising safe?
