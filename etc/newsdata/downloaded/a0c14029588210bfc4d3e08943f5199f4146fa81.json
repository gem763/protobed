Guyger was standing near the front door when the officers arrived and could be heard saying: 'I thought it was my apartment'.\n\nThe footage showed the two officers immediately rendering CPR to Jean who was shown lying on the floor surrounded by blood.\n\nGuyger appeared to be pushed out of the apartment while the officers gave Jean first aid.\n\nAmber Guyger was shown (left) in police body camera footage played to the jury during her murder trial on Tuesday as first responders arrived to the Dallas apartment where she shot her neighbor Botham Jean last year\n\nGuyger was captured on an officer's body cam standing in the corridor outside on her phone as CPR was being given to Jean inside, according to prosecutors\n\nProsecutors then showed another body cam image that showed Guyger standing in hallway outside the apartment looking at her phone as CPR was being administered.\n\nShe was also shown hugging and speaking to fellow officers on the scene.\n\nOfficer Michael Lee, whose body cam was shown to the court, was questioned by the prosecution and said Jean was not responsive when they were performing CPR.\n\nHe said he and his partner did not stop performing first aid until they were relieved by paramedics.\n\nDetective Eddie Ibarra also took the stand Tuesday and said that there were no drugs or alcohol in Guyger's system at the time of the incident.\n\nIbarra's testimony marked the first time Guyger's toxicology results have been publicly revealed.\n\nThe detective said on the night of the shooting he also took Guyger's full uniform to search for any biological evidence that may have been present. Her apartment was searched the next day by members of his team, he said.\n\nProsecutors argued that Guyger received special treatment in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.\n\nGuyger was taken from the apartment by Sgt. Breanna Valentine whose job it was to take her to her patrol car and isolate her.\n\nWhile sitting in a patrol car downstairs, Guyger was allegedly told not to talk and warned that there was audio recording in the vehicle.\n\nProsecutors showed footage of Guyger interacting with her fellow officers and hugging at least one of them.\n\nThe President of the Dallas Police Associated, Michael Mata, soon arrived and took Guyger out of the vehicle, prosecutors said.\n\nThe court heard that Mata told Valentine to switch the audio off.\n\nValentine admitted during her testimony that she would have kept the camera on if she had known Guyger was off-duty at the time of the shooting.\n\nProsecutors told jurors that this type of treatment would not have occurred had Guyger been a regular citizen in custody.\n\nGuyger's attorney argued that she was awaiting an attorney and that Mata was protecting her right to one.\n\nThe jury on Tuesday was shown footage from a body camera worn by one of two officers who arrived at the apartment after Guyger called 911. Guyger is shown on the right as she left the apartment when officers started performing CPR\n\nThe body cam footage showed Guyger meeting the two officers at the door of Jean's apartment. She was standing near the front door when the officers arrived and could be heard saying: 'I thought it was my apartment'\n\nProsecutors said on Monday that Jean was sitting in his living room, eating a bowl of vanilla ice cream when Guyger walked into his home and shot him\n\nEarlier, the jurors were played the 911 call Guyger made to dispatchers about the shooting.\n\nIn the 911 call, Guyger tells the dispatcher that she shot Jean because she thought she was in her own apartment.\n\nIn the call, Guyger says 'I thought it was my apartment' nearly 20 times. She also says: 'I'm gonna lose my job' and 'I am going to need a supervisor.'\n\n'I'm f****d. Oh my God. I'm sorry,' Guyger says in the recording.\n\nThroughout the call, she also spoke to Jean, called him 'bud' and encouraged him to stay alive.\n\nJoshua Brown, who lived across the hall from Jean, testified on Tuesday that he was walking down the hallway when he heard two people speaking followed immediately by two gunshots.\n\nOnce he was back in his apartment, Brown said he saw Guyger through his peep hole crying on the phone in the hallway\n\nand telling whoever she was speaking to that she had gone into the wrong apartment.\n\nHe said she went back into the apartment and then came out again to meet officers.\n\nBrown started crying on the witness stand when he was asked about the victim. He said he could hear Jean singing Gospel music and Drake in the mornings. Brown said he had only met Jean for the first time on the day he was killed.\n\nProsecutors said on Monday that Jean was sitting in his living room, eating a bowl of vanilla ice cream when Guyger walked into his home and shot him.\n\nDallas County assistant district attorney Jason Hermus told jurors that Guyger had worked a long day but that it was primarily office work during her 13.5 hour shift.\n\nHe said there was no evidence that Jean ever posed a threat to Guyger.\n\nHe told the jury that when Guyger got to her apartment complex, she parked on the fourth floor instead of the third floor, where she had lived for two months.\n\nWhen she arrived at what she thought was her unit, she failed to notice the bright red semi-circle welcome mat in front of Jean's apartment, he said.\n\nJean's apartment was also unlocked, messy and smelled of marijuana, three more signs that should have tipped Guyger off that it was not her apartment, Hermus said.\n\nDallas Police Sgt. Breanna Valentine testified on Tuesday. Valentine took Guyger from the apartment and escorted her to her patrol car to isolate her. One the screen above Valentine is an image of Guyger appearing to text on her phone outside Jean's apartment\n\nDallas Police officer Michael Lee listens and watches his body cam footage played for the jury during Guyger's murder trial\n\nAssistant District Attorney Jason Hermus showed Martin Rivera copies of the texts and Snapchat messages he had sent Guyger on the day of the shooting. He admitted to deleting these messages in the wake of the shooting\n\nDespite the clues, she still burst through the door and opened fire, striking Jean once in the chest as he watched television and ate a bowl of vanilla ice cream.\n\n'He was in the sanctuary of his home doing no harm to anyone,' Hermus said. 'There he lay on his back in his home bleeding to death alone with his killer.'\n\nGuyger's attorney rejected the prosecution argument that there were unique signs that would have signaled to her that she was on the wrong floor.\n\nIn fact, he said, the identical look of the apartment complex from floor to floor often led to confusion among tenants, with dozens regularly parking on the wrong floor or attempting to enter the wrong apartment.\n\nRogers said the floors of the parking garage were not clearly marked so it was understandable when Guyger, tired from a long shift, pushed open a door and believed an intruder was inside.\n\nGuyger 'was on autopilot,' he said of her entrance to Jean's apartment. 'She had tunnel vision.'\n\nProsecutors have said Guyger was on the phone with her police partner Martin Rivera, who she was having a sexual relationship with, for 16 minutes as she headed back to to her apartment that night in September 2018.\n\nThey told jurors that Guyger and Rivera had plans to meet up later that night.\n\nRivera, however, denied during his testimony on Monday that he had made any plans to rendezvous with Guyger later that night.\n\nGuyger told investigators she mistakenly entered the apartment of Jean, which was one floor above her own, when she returned home from work on the evening of September 6, 2018\n\nGuyger was off duty but still in uniform when she shot Jean in his home (above) on the evening of September 6, 2018\n\nProsecutors argue that Guyger was distracted by her phone conversation with Rivera when she mistook Jean's apartment for hers and entered, believed him to be an intruder and shot him.\n\nWhen questioned about what their lengthy phone call was about, Rivera said he believes it was mostly about police work but his memory of the call was hazy.\n\nProsecutors had earlier revealed that the two had exchanged sexually explicit messages and images earlier that day.\n\nShe also allegedly sent two text messages to her partner while she was simultaneously on the phone to 911 as Jean was bleeding to death on his floor.\n\nProsecutors said that after Guyger shot Jean, she deleted the logs of her text exchanges with Rivera from her cellphone.\n\nRivera said he didn't not know why she had done that but admitted that he had also deleted their text exchanges.\n\nThe case has attracted intense scrutiny for its strange circumstances and as one in a chain of shootings of black men by white police officers.\n\nGuyger was off duty but still in uniform when she shot Jean in his home on the evening of September 6, 2018.\n\nShe told investigators that after a 15-hour shift she parked on the fourth floor of her apartment complex's garage - rather than the third floor where she lived - and found the apartment's door ajar.\n\nBelieving she was at her own apartment and seeing a silhouette of a figure who didn't respond to verbal commands, Guyger said she fired two shots, killing him.", "description": "Police body cam footage was played to the jury during ex-cop Amber Guyger's murder trial on Tuesday after she shot dead her neighbor 26-year-old Botham Jean.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/18/18880688-0-image-a-65_1569344950991.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
