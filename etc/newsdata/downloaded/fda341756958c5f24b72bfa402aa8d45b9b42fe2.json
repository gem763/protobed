In Tippecanoe Superior Court on Friday they pleaded not guilty.\n\nThey are accused of abandoning their adopted daughter when they moved north of the border.\n\nThe family moved to Waterloo so their 15-year-old son, who is gifted, could attend Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. The family did a round of media interviews about the move at the time and about Kristine Barnett's book, The Spark, in which she discusses how she nurtured her genius son.\n\nThe son remains at the school as a Ph. D candidate, Perimeter confirmed Friday. The institute said it would not comment further, citing the son's right to privacy.\n\nLocation unclear\n\nIt's unclear whether Kristine or Michael still live in the area. Kristine's Facebook page says she lives in Waterloo, but when reached by email, she would not confirm that.\n\n\"I am very exhausted and I have to go to court in the morning to plead innocent,\" Barnett said in an email to CBC Kitchener-Waterloo Thursday evening.\n\nLast week, Barnett gave an interview to the British Daily Mail newspaper in which she claims the family was duped and the daughter they adopted from Ukraine was not a child, but rather a 30-year-old woman with dwarfism.\n\nAge legally changed\n\nThe Tippecanoe County Prosecutor's Office told CBC it was unable to comment on the case because doing so \"would have a prejudicial impact on a case and/or defendant.\"\n\nCourt documents released by the prosecutor's office to CBC Kitchener-Waterloo said the girl at the centre of the case told police she arrived in the U.S. from Ukraine in 2008 and was adopted by the Barnetts in 2010.\n\nGirl left on own in Lafayette\n\nShe said she lived with the family for two years before the Barnetts rented an apartment for her.\n\nThe documents say the girl was \"left alone in the apartment in Lafayette [Indiana] while the rest of the Barnett family moved to Canada\" and the girl has not seen them since. Michael Barnett told officials that they paid rent on the apartment, but did not otherwise financially support the girl.\n\nThe family and prosecutors give conflicting information over the girl's age.\n\nBefore they moved, court documents say the Barnetts had the girl's age legally changed in 2012 from eight years old to 22.\n\nThe adopted daughter has a form of dwarfism called spondyloepiphyseal, which results in abnormal bone growth. The documents say she was examined at the Peyton Manning Children's Hospital on June 3, 2010, which estimated the girl was eight years old. A skeletal survey in 2012 showed her to be approximately 11 years old, the court documents say.\n\n\"Michael Barnett admitted he believed [the girl] was a minor child in July of 2013 when Michael Barnett and Kristine Barnett left [her] at an apartment in Lafayette,\" the documents say.\n\nThe Barnetts are due to return to court on Dec. 27 for a pretrial conference. Court documents show a jury trial is scheduled for Jan. 28, 2020.", "description": "A man and woman who moved to Waterloo, Ont., in 2013 so their teenage son could attend the Perimeter Institute are now at the centre of a court case in Indiana.
