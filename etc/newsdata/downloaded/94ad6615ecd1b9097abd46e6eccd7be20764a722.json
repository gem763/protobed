REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nEuropean shares gained despite falling German industrial orders data, which underscored concerns about a looming recession in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.54% by midday in London. [.EU]\n\nStocks worldwide took a battering last week, falling to their lowest in more than a month on fears of a U.S. economic slowdown. But positive U.S. jobs data on Friday helped spark a turnaround.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that the U.S. jobs report was broadly positive really put the brakes on the fear factor that was circulating last week - that the U.S. has been hit hard by the trade war,\u201d said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets in London.\n\nAsian stocks rallied in the slipstream of gains on Wall Street, with MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific Shares outside Japan rising 0.06%. .MIAPJ0000PUS\n\nJapan's Nikkei stock index .N225 opened higher but reversed course and declined 0.2%. A key Japanese economic index fell in August and the government downgraded its outlook for the economy to \"worsening,\" suggesting export-reliant Japan could slip into recession.\n\nMSCI\u2019s All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares across 47 markets, moved into positive territory, up 0.1% after hovering between flat and negative for most of morning trade.\n\nGermany's DAX .GDAXI rose 0.5%, shrugging off data that showed industrial orders fell slightly more than expected in August.\n\nMorale among investors in the euro zone dropped in October to its lowest in more than six years as stimulus measures taken by central banks failed to allay recession fears, a survey by the Sentix research group showed.\n\nBesides the steady trickle of weak economic data, investors also had their eyes on U.S.-China trade talks. Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials are signaling they are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe report briefly lifted the safe-haven Japanese yen and gold.\n\nAn impeachment drive by U.S. Democrats arising from a whistleblower\u2019s allegations that Trump leveraged $400 million in aid to secure a promise from Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Trumps\u2019s political rival Joe Biden will continue this week. Several U.S. diplomats will head to Capitol Hill for closed-door testimony.\n\nOn Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come forward to substantiate the first complaint from an unnamed U.S. government official, which touched off the investigation.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the second whistleblower coming forward will be an issue for Trump. This strengthens China\u2019s bargaining position in the trade war,\u201d Madden said.\n\nU.S. stock futures were 0.2% lower. ESc1 NQc1 [.N]\n\nIn currencies, the dollar was 0.1% higher against a basket of peers. The euro was flat at $1.0983 EUR=EBS. Sterling was lower on investors fears that Britain and the European Union are no closer to agreeing a Brexit withdrawal deal. [GBP/]\n\nEuro zone government bond yields fell slightly as investors weighed signs of a resilient U.S. economy against concerns the U.S.-Sino trade negotiations could fail.\n\nThere was some outperformance in Portugal\u2019s bond market following a ratings upgrade on Friday and a weekend election.[GVD/EUR]\n\nYields in the biggest economies of the euro area were slightly lower, with the German 10-year Bund yield falling 1.1 basis points (bps) to -0.598% DE10YT=RR.\n\nOil prices rose.
