At times, it became extreme, such as when Elting poured water on Shawe's head to end a meeting or when Shawe hid under Elting's hotel bed and refused to leave during a business trip, according to court documents. Shawe denied the claim.\n\nThe New York Police even became involved after Shawe claimed Elting kicked him with her high heel.\n\nGOP primaries: Republicans in 4 states may cancel their 2020 primaries to support Trump\n\nDuring the Delaware proceedings, Bouchard also ruled that Phil Shawe had repeatedly lied under oath and intentionally destroyed evidence.\n\nWith Bouchard's rulings effectively taking her side, Elting largely faded from public view. The Shawes took the opposite approach.\n\nThe rulings triggered a backlash from the Shawes as well as from numerous workers within the company. Arguing that a sale would tear the company apart, employees hired a high-profile New York public relations company, called Tusk Strategies, which then incorporated an advocacy company called Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware.\n\nWhat happened next were well-choreographed and well-publicized protests that appeared outside Delaware's Supreme Court in Dover. The demonstrations were composed largely of TransPerfect employees who had traveled from New York and Georgia, according to company officials.\n\nNational parks: Trump administration blasted for illegally maintaining national parks during shutdown\n\nInside the Supreme Court was Shawe's appeal of Bouchard's ruling. At one point during the proceedings, a shouting match erupted between celebrity attorney Alan Dershowitz and Delaware's outspoken Supreme Court Chief Justice Leo Strine.\n\nSeparately, the Shawes attempted to lobby lawmakers to change state law to prevent the courts from ordering the sale of profitable companies. Phil Shawe also filed a federal lawsuit against Delaware, claiming the state law permitting Chancery Court to sell a private company violates the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn 2017, the campaign spread to Amazon's search for a second headquarters when Citizens for Pro-Business Delaware announced that it would write a letter to the retail giant's CEO, Jeff Bezos, urging him \"to recognize the risks of considering Delaware\" for the facility.\n\nToday, the backlash has bled into national politics, where Biden and about 20 other Democrats are vying for their party's presidential nomination.", "description": "With a half-million dollar political\u00a0ad buy,\u00a0TransPerfect's\u00a0ferocious public battle with\u00a0the Delaware courts has bled into presidential politics.", "authors": ["Karl Baker", "Delaware News Journal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.5lmNTG7g6xHGO7aamI5nw--~B/aD0xMzMxO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/829919b0e6cec3d73623bc12e975979c", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
