But the new trailer for 1917, Sam Mendes\u2019s first war film since Jarhead, definitely proves that wrong. George MacKay (yes, from Amandla Stenberg\u2019s Nazi movie) and Dean-Charles Chapman (Game of Thrones) star as two soldiers tasked with an important mission: Deliver a message through enemy territory, calling off an attack. If they don\u2019t make it, 1,600 men will die, including one of their brothers. It is very serious and scary, but there are so many beautiful familiar faces to guide you through the anxiety. Richard Madden, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, and the hot priest himself, Andrew Scott, all feature in the film. Plus, it\u2019s shot by cinematographer-crush Roger Deakins, famously meant to look like one continuous take. It\u2019ll be Deakins\u2019s second release this year, right after The Goldfinch, starring Ansel Elgort, Finn Wolfhard, and Aneurin Barnard. Apparently after hot-girl summer comes emotionally fraught, skinny white-boy fall.\n\nRelated", "description": "The \u20181917\u2019 trailer features British actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Dean-Charles Chapman, and more.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/01/01-1917.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
