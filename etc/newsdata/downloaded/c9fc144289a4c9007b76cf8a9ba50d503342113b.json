First up, Silicon Valley editor Casey Newton starts the show by explaining what we heard candidly from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in leaked audio of an internal Facebook Q&A. The Vergecast explains what Zuckerberg\u2019s comments say about Facebook\u2019s unique place in the antitrust debate.\n\nNext, Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Paul Miller run through everything that was announced at Microsoft\u2019s Surface event this week, including some new foldable devices and Microsoft\u2019s partnership with Android. Will the folding form factor stand the test of time?\n\nWe\u2019ve also got updates on the fight for net neutrality. An appeals court this week upheld the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s repeal of net neutrality laws, but it vacated a rule that would prevent states from passing their own versions of the laws. You can hear Nilay colorfully explain this court ruling on this episode.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot in between all of that \u2014 including Paul Miller\u2019s weekly segment \u201cI\u2019ve seen The Matrix. I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d \u2014 so listen through to get it all.\n\nStories discussed on the show:", "description": "We\u2019ve got some leaked audio from Facebook\u2019s internal meetings, a rundown of all the devices Microsoft announced at its Surface event, and what people may have missed regarding net neutrality this week.", "authors": ["Andrew Marino", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQWCozv8iGCuV8fJ_4qW4WT3wa4=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19254781/akrales_191002_3704_0431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
