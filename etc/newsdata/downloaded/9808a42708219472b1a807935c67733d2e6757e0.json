[BLUE HOUSE]\n\nA Korean-Japanese parliamentary group is promoting an idea to break the diplomatic logjam between the two countries that involves Seoul returning to a bilateral intelligence-sharing pact and Tokyo cancelling export restrictions, a member of the group exclusively told the JoongAng Ilbo on Tuesday.One \u201cimportant opportunity\u201d for both countries to decide on such a \u201csimultaneous action plan\u201d will come at the end of this month, when Seoul dispatches an official to Japanese Emperor Naruhito\u2019s enthronement ceremony on Oct. 22 in Tokyo, the source continued.Seoul has yet to announce who it is sending, but one strong candidate appears to be Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon.A member of the parliamentary group who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the JoongAng Ilbo in a telephone interview that the group has been holding serious discussions on the simultaneous action plan as the Nov. 22 deadline for the termination of the General Security of Military Information Agreement (Gsomia) nears.Signed in November 2016, Gsomia is renewed automatically every year unless either of the two countries decides to scrap the pact, in which case it must provide the other with at least a 90 days\u2019 notice. The Blue House announced in late August that it decided to withdraw from Gsomia, and unless it retracts that announcement, the intelligence-sharing pact will no longer be in force from Nov. 23.The source did not explain to the JoongAng Ilbo report whether the parliamentary group\u2019s discussions were having any impact on Tokyo yet, but if Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s recent remarks give any hints, it appears the lawmakers still have a long way to go.During a meeting between Japanese political parties on Tuesday, Abe steadfastly blamed Seoul for \u201churting\u201d mutual trust between Korea and Japan by violating a 1965 treaty and urged Seoul to obey the principles of international law.Abe continued that it was up to Seoul to create an opportunity for both countries to return to a \u201csound relationship.\u201dPresident Moon Jae-in showed no sign of backing down either.During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday at the Blue House, Moon praised the Korean government and local companies for \u201ccoping well\u201d with Japan\u2019s export restrictions so far, saying \u201cmeaningful achievements\u201d were made on \u201cnumerous fronts,\u201d such as companies diversifying their import routes, improving \u201ctechnological independence\u201d and seeking cooperation between bigger and smaller companies.Moon said if Korean companies use Japan\u2019s restrictions as a chance to \u201cfundamentally change our industrial structure,\u201d such efforts will immensely boost Korea\u2019s economic competitiveness.With both Moon and Abe refusing to relent, all eyes are on possible negotiations between the two countries at a lower level later this month.Citing unnamed diplomatic sources, The Japan Times reported Tuesday that Seoul has told Tokyo it may send Prime Minister Lee to Emperor Naruhito\u2019s enthronement ceremony and that the possibility of Moon\u2019s participation \u201chas vanished.\u201d In case Lee does travel to Japan, meetings may be arranged between him and two former Japanese prime ministers - Yoshiro Mori and Yasuo Fukuda - both of whom belong to the same faction of the Liberal Democratic Party as Abe, the paper wrote.BY SEO SEUNG-WOOK, LEE SUNG-EUN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/08201507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
