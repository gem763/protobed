Pictured left, Nigel Dodds, next to DUP party leader Arlene Foster\n\nBut only minutes later, the unionist party reiterated its opposition to the agreement, saying it could not support it. It later issued a scathing statement making clear it would vote against it tomorrow.\n\nThe party rejected the revised Withdrawal Agreement because it does not give unionists in the Northern Ireland assembly a veto over controversial new customs arrangements, which bring in an effective boundary down the Irish Sea.\n\nThe DUP is also worried that the new VAT rules could cause too much red tape for Ulster firms.\n\nNigel Dodds, the party\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u2018We will not support a deal which is detrimental to Northern Ireland, which damages our economy in the process and which tears up the Belfast Agreement safeguards upon which the power sharing arrangements in Northern Ireland depend.\u2019\n\nBut Mr Johnson, pictured in Brussels this afternoon, decided to press ahead with his agreement without the support of the unionist party\n\nThe DUP tweeted yesterday and said: 'The Democratic Unionist Party will be unable to support these proposals in Parliament'\n\nThe 1998 peace deal said unionists must have a veto over any changes to the way Northern Ireland is run. Mr Johnson\u2019s deal would allow the province to remain in the EU customs zone even without unionist support.\n\nThe DUP \u2013 the Tories\u2019 confidence-and-supply ally \u2013 said: \u2018These arrangements will become the settled position in these areas for Northern Ireland.\n\nThis drives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast Agreement.\n\nFor all of these reasons it is our view that these arrangements would not be in Northern Ireland\u2019s long-term interests.\u2019\n\nThe party\u2019s stance is a blow for the PM, who has a majority of minus 45.\n\nMs Foster and Mr Dodds have been frequent visitors to Number 10 in recent days but talks ended in acrimony\n\nThe DUP has ten MPs \u2013 meaning their lack of support could be vital tomorrow. But Mr Johnson appears to have calculated that it is better to dump his DUP allies than miss the chance of sealing a deal.\n\nSpeaking alongside DUP leader Arlene Foster last night, Mr Dodds hit out at the Prime Minister.\n\nHe said the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to ask for an extension if there is No Deal by tomorrow, had forced the Prime Minister into \u2018desperation measures\u2019. He added that he expected a \u2018massive vote\u2019 against the deal tomorrow.\n\nAfter announcing the agreement, Mr Johnson tweeted: \u2018The people of Northern Ireland will be in charge of the laws that they live by, and, unlike the backstop, will have the right to end the special arrangement if they so choose.\u2019", "description": "After the Prime Minister agreed to a deal with the EU that it refused to support, the Democratic Unionist Party said Mr Johnson had been 'too eager by far to get a deal at any cost'.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin Policy Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/01/19864340-0-image-a-71_1571357770847.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
