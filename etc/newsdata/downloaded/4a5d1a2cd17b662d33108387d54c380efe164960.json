It sees the potential for rampant smuggling, especially as Johnson intends for the rest of the UK to diverge from EU labour, environmental and tax norms to aim for a regulation-lite economy on Europe\u2019s doorstep.\n\nNor does the EU agree with a proposal that Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly be given a right to effectively veto the post-Brexit customs arrangement.\n\nIf either of those two proposals are red lines for Johnson, it is hard to see the EU moving talks into the negotiation phase.\n\nYet if he bends on them, he risks losing tenuous support in the UK parliament to maybe pass a Brexit deal, reliant on 10 Democratic Unionist MPs from Northern Ireland and hard-core Brexit MPs in his Conservative Party.\n\n\u2013 Extension option \u2013\n\nIf thwarted, Johnson\u2019s best bet may lie with early elections.\n\nThere he also faces a challenge, with the UK parliament having passed a law requiring him to seek a Brexit extension from the EU by October 19 if he has not reached a deal by then.\n\nBritish media speculated that Johnson might seek to sabotage any extension request he is forced to make against his will.\n\nOne path included his ministers asking an EU member state to block the unanimous approval needed for an extension, with Hungary cited as a likely ally to break EU ranks.\n\nBut Budapest denied Britain had approached it with such a request, and a Hungarian foreign ministry source told AFP: \u201cTo date there is no request for a delay, hence there is no point in speculating about anything.\u201d", "description": "Brussels (AFP) \u2013 EU and UK officials are to resume talks Monday on Britain\u2019s plans for a managed Brexit after a weekend hiatus during which", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/f4e790_time-is-running-short-britain-eu-close-big-gaps-uk-proposals-managed-brexit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
