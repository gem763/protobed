It's so nice to hear that so many people loved it. I'm a bit like, 'Aw, damn it, maybe she shouldn't have waved goodbye at the end'. But it does feel right. It feels right to go out on a high, and you can't get higher than this.\"\n\nPhoto credit: BBC More\n\nWaller-Bridge hasn't completely put Fleabag behind her. She recently wrapped up a sold-out stage version of the series at London's Wyndham's Theatre following a successful Broadway run.\n\nShe also had more success at the Emmys on Sunday night when Jodie Comer won the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Killing Eve, which Waller-Bridge adapted for TV and produces.\n\nPhoto credit: Jeff Kravitz - Getty Images More\n\nWaller-Bridge has also written the next James Bond film No Time to Die, which will be released in the UK on April 3, 2020 and in the US on April 8, 2020.\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
