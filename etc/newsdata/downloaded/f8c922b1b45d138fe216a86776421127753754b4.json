These recommendations are usually risk/reward commodities meant to be used in large-field tournaments. Typically, blending these low-owned hidden gems with well-aligned staples contributes to a viable GPP strategy.\n\nKeep in mind that the following player write-ups were constructed earlier in the day, and sometimes injury/rest situations can alter the fantasy landscape. Monitoring our MLB News & Headlines Feed throughout the day will keep you in the loop while giving you the subsequent DFS consequences of each information piece.\n\nWe will be looking at the eight-game main slate beginning at 1:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nMiles Mikolas - St. Louis (vs. Cincinnati)\n\nMikolas struggled through the majority of August, allowing five earned runs across three straight starts. However, he bounced back nicely last Tuesday, racking up ten strikeouts while yielding only four hits and one earned run at Milwaukee. He\u2019ll look to carry that momentum into today\u2019s home draw against Cincinnati, who ranks 22nd in wRC+ this season. On top of that, Mikolas\u2019 salary has fallen considerably due to those recent struggles, so this is an interesting buy-low opportunity.\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nRyan O\u2019Hearn - Kansas City (vs. Baltimore)\n\nStory continues\n\nO\u2019Hearn was considered a sleeper for season-long fantasy baseball at the beginning of the season, but things haven\u2019t exactly gone his way while holding a .184 average with 10 homers through 272 at-bats. However, that doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore him for daily fantasy purposes, especially considering his recent tear of eight hits and three homers over his past six games. The matchup looks promising against Baltimore RHP Aaron Brooks (.359 wOBA vs. LHB) and a generous Orioles\u2019 bullpen.\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nBrian Dozier - Washington (vs. Miami)\n\nSpeaking of disappointing seasons, Brian Dozier\u2019s 2019 campaign probably falls into that category. He hasn\u2019t done much for fantasy backers recently either, as a snapshot of his game log looks pretty bleak. However, we all know that Dozier is a capable bat against left-handed pitching, and he\u2019ll step into a sneaky-good matchup against Miami LHP Caleb Smith. The Marlins\u2019 southpaw looked great to begin the season, but he has fallen on tough times while allowing five or more earned runs in three of his past five starts.\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nHunter Dozier - Kansas City (vs. Baltimore)\n\nLet\u2019s turn our attention to Hunter Dozier, who is no relation to Brian (I double-checked). The Kansas City third baseman is enjoying a breakout season while hitting .278 with 24 homers and 75 RBIs. As mentioned earlier, Baltimore RHP Aaron Brooks has been kind to opposing hitters, currently sporting a .351 wOBA split to right-handed bats. Dozier has slapped a pair of homers over his last four starts, and he could keep that momentum in this friendly draw.\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nPaul DeJong - St. Louis (vs. Cincinnati)\n\nWe can\u2019t forget about the Cardinals this afternoon, who will square off against Cincinnati spot-starter Tyler Mahle. Even though Mahle has gotten shelled by left-handed bats throughout his career (.397 wOBA split), I\u2019m not counting out right-handed hitters like Paul Goldschmidt and Paul DeJong. The latter has been warming up over the past week or two, and there\u2019s not a ton of opportunity cost at the shortstop position this afternoon.\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nKhris Davis - Oakland (at NY Yankees)\n\nDavis has a questionable tag next to his name, but he\u2019s expected to return from the paternity list to start today\u2019s game. He\u2019ll settle into a pretty good matchup as well, facing volatile NYY lefty J.A. Happ with a park boost at Yankee Stadium. This is a strong leverage opportunity if Davis cracks the lineup - as expected.\n\nJake Cave - Minnesota (at Detroit)\n\nByron Buxton is still hurt, and Marwin Gonzalez is dealing with an injury as well. The Twins called up outfielder LaMonte Wade, but I\u2019m expecting Jake Cave to start in right field today. He would make for an adequate fantasy bargain if that\u2019s the case, facing Detroit RHP Spencer Turnbull\u2019s .350 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Cave has been a pleasant surprise lately, recording a pair of multi-homer performances over the past week.", "description": "Spencer Limbach finds some sneaky-good MLB GPP Pivots away from the popular picks for Sunday, September 1.
