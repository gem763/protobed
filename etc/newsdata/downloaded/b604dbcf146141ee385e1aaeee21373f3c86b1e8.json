He will write features throughout the year, and cover the 2016 Democratic and Republican National Conventions. He begins his new role today.\n\n\u201cI have had the privilege of working with Andrew from the beginning of his career (mine too). He is a major (deep and elegant) thinker and writer whose work has had tangible consequence, and he has written some of the more influential essays I have ever had the honor to publish. He also happens to be a true innovator\u2015one of the first and best political writers online,\u201d says Moss. \u201cSince he stepped away from his blog in 2015, his voice has been greatly missed in our national dialogue. I\u2019m grateful that he will return to writing at New York.\u201d\n\nSullivan began his pioneering blog the Daily Dish in 2000, eventually hosting it at publications including Time, The Atlantic, and the Daily Beast before launching the Dish as an independent, subscriber-funded website in early 2013. In January 2015, he announced his decision to close the site and retire from daily blogging.\n\nSullivan was editor of The New Republic from 1991 to 1996, and a writer for The New York Times Magazine from 1996 to 2002. He is the author of several books, including The Conservative Soul and Virtually Normal. A graduate of Oxford University, he received an MPA and PhD from Harvard University.\n\nSullivan joins a robust political team covering the 2016 election at New York, including daily columnists Jonathan Chait and Ed Kilgore; national affairs editor Gabriel Sherman; writers-at-large Frank Rich, Rembert Browne, and Rebecca Traister; contributing editors Marin Cogan, Annie Lowrey, and Jason Zengerle; and Daily Intelligencer writers Margaret Hartmann and Eric Levitz.", "description": "Sullivan will cover politics and the larger culture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/following/2016/04/01/01-andrew-sullivan.w1200.h630.jpg"}
