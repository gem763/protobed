Bush and have about 100 people by as early as next February.\n\n'It just ballooned into a massive, you know, bureaucracy ... under the last administration,' he said in an interview later on the Fox Business Network program Lou Dobbs Tonight.\n\nTrump has also complained about people in the NSC who apparently provided a male CIA agent with information about the July 25 phone call he had with the Ukrainian president, in which he pressed for an investigation of his political rival, Joe Biden.\n\nDuring the call with Zelensky, Trump pushed for an investigation into why a Ukranian prosecutor investigating an energy company had been fired. The pair are pictured together on September 25 - exactly two months after their phone conversation\n\nAfter hearing about the phone call, the CIA agent lodged a whistleblower complaint, sparking the current impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\nWhile the whistleblower will now have to give testimony as part of the inquiry, he may not do so in person in order to protect his identity.\n\nThe whistleblower has reportedly asked to submit written testimony to Congress instead of appearing in person in order to stay anonymous.\n\nIf the request is granted it would see the testimony given during a closed-door congressional hearing or submitted as a written document.\n\nFears the whistleblower's safety could be put in jeopardy if he is publicly identified have so far led to his name being kept a closely guarded secret among lawyers and House Democrats familiar with his allegations.\n\nTrump's phone call has been seen by many as attempt to dig up dirt on Hunter and Joe Biden (pictured)\n\nThe president has previously gone after the whistleblower, identified by the New York Times as a CIA officer, and demanded the right to face his accuser.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that House Democrats may interview the whistleblower at an off-site location to protect their identity, amid concerns it could leak.\n\nThe whistleblower has previously been identified as having a Democratic party affiliation.\n\nOn Wednesday, attorneys for the CIA whistleblower issued a carefully-worded statement denying that the had a 'professional' link to a 2020 Democratic candidate, saying he is an apolitical civil servant.\n\nHis lawyers said they wanted to 'clarify some facts' and denied in a statement that the whistleblower made the complaint due to any political allegiance.", "description": "Sources told Fox News on Saturday that NSC leadership were alerted to the fact that someone within their ranks had been relaying details of the conversation to outsiders -a breach of protocol.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com", "Chris Dyer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/14/19627136-0-image-a-2_1570888329271.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
