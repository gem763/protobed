The truck driver, a 25-year-old from Northern Ireland, was taken into custody.\n\n\"This is an absolute tragedy, and a very sad day,\" said Pippa Mills, deputy chief constable of Essex Police.\n\nPolice said they\u2019re in the early stages of the investigation \u2014 there\u2019s still a lot to be learned. But some information has started to make its way to the public.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far.\n\nThe dead appear to be migrants\n\nThirty-eight of the dead appeared to be adults, while one was a teenager, police said.\n\n\u201cThe police are still trying to identify the dead, but all the evidence would suggest that these were migrants,\u201d said Bill Neely, NBC\u2019s chief global correspondent, on air.\n\nPolice said they couldn\u2019t yet say where the people were from, let alone who they were.\n\n\u201cAt this stage we have not identified where the victims are from or their identities,\u201d Mills said. \u201cAnd we anticipate this could be a lengthy process.\u201d\n\nA refrigerated container\n\nPolice were called to the industrial park in the town of Grays in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The bodies were in the back of the truck, inside what appeared to be a refrigerated container, Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, told the BBC.\n\n\"Can we just think for a moment of what it must have been like for those 39 people, obviously in a desperate and dangerous situation, for their lives to end, suffocated to death in a container?\" said Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party.\n\nAuthorities think the truck originated in Bulgaria and took a looping route into the country through the Welsh port of Holyhead. A spokesman for the Bulgarian foreign affairs ministry told the BBC it had not been confirmed that the truck was registered in Bulgaria.\n\n\"If the lorry came from Bulgaria, getting into Britain via Holyhead is an unorthodox route,\u201d said Seamus Leheny, Northern Ireland policy manager for the Freight Transport Association (FTA), according to Sky News.\n\nThe driver may have taken such a route to avoid checkpoints intended to curtail human trafficking.\n\n\u2018All too regular an occurrence\u2019\n\nEssex Police said it was working alongside a number of partner agencies to try to piece together what happened. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was being kept up to date.\n\n\u201cI am receiving regular updates and the Home Office will work closely with Essex Police as we establish exactly what has happened,\u201d Johnson said on Twitter. \u201cMy thoughts are with all those who lost their lives [and] their loved ones.\u201d\n\nThere have been incidents similar to Wednesday\u2019s tragedy. In 2015, 71 bodies were found inside a freezer truck on a highway in Austria. Most of the dead were migrants from Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cSadly, this is not the first time that we have found people in metal containers in my constituency,\u201d said Jackie Doyle-Price, a Conservative lawmaker, according to the Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry to say it\u2019s all-too-regular an occurrence and it was only a matter of time before that would end in tragedy.\u201d\n\nCover: Police stand near the site where 39 bodies were discovered in the back of a lorry on October 23, 2019 in Thurrock, England.
