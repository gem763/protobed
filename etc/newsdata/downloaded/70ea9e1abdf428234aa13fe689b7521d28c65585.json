I jumped on a plane and went,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nFrom London she then decided to continue attending crypto conferences to learn and meet people - and she would do it by only using the digital currency.\n\nShe began in Australia and her trip took her to to Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, America and the Bahamas.\n\n'I Googled places that accepted cryptocurrency in the different places I was visiting... These were either physical shops or websites that I could pay for things with crypto.'\n\n'It was a great way to travel. I actually don't think I could have completed the journey solo. Friends bailed me out on a few occasions and I was able to repay them with crypto. It wasn't the original plan, but I had to adapt along the way to get by.'\n\nMs Barclay said towards the end of her trip the value of Bitcoin began to climb which resulted in some wild after-parties at the conferences.\n\nHer favourite destinations were New York due to the absence of a language barrier and the enthusiasm around blockchain.\n\nAlso scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef was another highlight because she says it is such a wonderful experience Australia has to offer that can be done by paying with cryptocurrency.", "description": "An Australian woman has revealed she was able to travel the world by investing in cryptocurrency.", "authors": ["Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/05/08/15662082-0-image-a-15_1562310004733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-05"}
