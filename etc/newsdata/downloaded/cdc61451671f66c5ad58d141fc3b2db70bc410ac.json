For convenience\u2019s sake let\u2019s calls one side, pativratas. And the other, feminazis. There is no high-level thinking to this choice of labels, I am simply following herd logic.\n\nI learnt about pativratas from the same place where I have learnt most of Indian culture: Bollywood. Mock me if you like, but not before denying that life itself does not feel known till its tit bits are seen on the screen and thereby elevated into knowledge. When the story, the scene, the emotions of one map onto the other isn\u2019t it eureka!?\n\nAnyway, so for a two minute cinematic summary of the festival you could do worse than begin with the karwa chauth song in Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham. Right away you know this is a group gig, like solo pativrata no, no. Next, super bling is super obligatory. Everyone goes for the Christmas tree look. There is also the moon and sieve thing putting a very pretty filter effect on the pati. Then, and unfortunately this particular song skips this critical part, the pativrata finally breaks her fast \u2013 she has gone the whole day without even drinking water!\n\nNow, the feminazis, as karwa chauth warriors call their opponents, are peeps who think it\u2019s a bit much that only the wife fasts for the long life of husband, some reciprocity would be nice \u2013 and incidentally fair.\n\nSo which side is winning? In the bazaar yesterday the mehndi and choori waalas were out in strength. The metro women\u2019s compartment was thinly occupied this morning. Neighbourhood kids say they have a school holiday today. Case closed.", "description": "Yes, karwa chauth, there is polarisation here too!
