The interview, published on Wednesday morning, is further proof that Swift may finally be ready to show us the \u201creal Taylor\u201d three years after dramatically declaring the old wide-eyed, red-lip-classic version of herself dead.\n\nIn fact, in the piece, she finally breaks down the meaning behind the notorious \u201cThe old Taylor can\u2019t come to the phone right now\u201d line from Reputation. \u201cI needed to make boundaries, to figure out what was mine and what was the public\u2019s,\u201d Swift told Rolling Stone\u2019s Brian Hiatt, who also interviewed her for the magazine back in 2012. \u201cThat old version of me that shares unfailingly and unblinkingly with a world that is probably not fit to be shared with? I think that\u2019s gone.\u201d As for why she delivered the line as a staticky voicemail greeting during the bridge of a spiteful, Right Said Fred-tinged revenge anthem, \u201cthat\u2019s how all of this started, a stupid phone call I shouldn\u2019t have picked up.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old is, of course, referring to her secretly recorded phone call with Kanye West in which she seems to give him permission to write about her in his 2016 song \u201cFamous,\u201d a call that reignited a celebrity feud of biblical proportions and could have doubled as a publicity campaign for the green snake emoji. In the damning recording, leaked by West\u2019s wife Kim Kardashian, Swift can be heard consenting to the song lyric, \u201cme and Taylor might still have sex.\u201d She has since maintained, however, that he never sought her approval for the lyric she actually took issue with, the one that comes afterwards that says, \u201cI made that bitch famous.\u201d Specifically, she had a problem with him calling her \u201cbitch.\u201d This account seems to be corroborated by the recording, in which Kanye does not mention that second line.\n\n\u201c Not only are some really racist, horrific undertones now becoming overtones in our political climate, but the people who are representing those concepts and that way of looking at the world are celebrating loudly, and it\u2019s horrific. \u201d\n\nNow, the singer reveals that there was much more to her side of the story. She meditates on the tumultuous ups and downs of her and West\u2019s relationship, beginning with the 2009 VMAs when he hijacked her Best Female Video acceptance speech. According to Swift, while she was branded as a snake in comments sections and Twitter threads across the internet, West was actually the one who was two-faced throughout the entirety of their friendship. First and foremost, she wants us to know that it was never just about being called a bitch.\n\n\u201cSome events took place to cause me to be pissed off when he called me a bitch,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was not just a singular event. Basically, I got really sick of the dynamic between he and I. And that wasn\u2019t just based on what happened on that phone call and with that song\u2014it was kind of a chain reaction of things.\u201d\n\nThe chain reaction began with the VMAs incident, which, Swift says, left her wanting nothing more than the famous rapper\u2019s approval. \u201cAll I ever wanted my whole career after that thing happened in 2009 was for him to respect me,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen someone doesn\u2019t respect you so loudly and says you literally don\u2019t deserve to be here\u2014I just so badly wanted that respect from him, and I hate that about myself, that I was like, \u2018This guy who\u2019s antagonizing me, I just want his approval.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe two stars made efforts to reconcile in the years that followed, leading up to the 2015 VMAs, where Swift presented West with the Vanguard award\u2014a public olive branch in the place where it all began six years before. Swift claims that, though she has no proof (\u201cI didn\u2019t illegally record it, so I can\u2019t play it for you\u201d), West called to personally ask her to present him with the award. She was blindsided when he got on stage to accept and shouted, \u201cYou know how many times they announced Taylor was going to give me the award \u2018cause it got them more ratings?\u201d\n\nAs she was standing in the audience, arm-in-arm with Kim, she says she realized, \u201che is so two-faced. That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk shit.\u201d For Swift, the release of \u201cFamous\u201d the following spring was simply the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\n\u201c All I ever wanted my whole career after that thing happened in 2009 was for [Kanye West] to respect me. \u201d \u2014 Taylor Swift\n\nSwift and Hiatt cover a lot of ground in the remainder of the interview. Though she describes their conversation as \u201cthe best therapy session,\u201d it reads like Swift\u2019s way of finally taking the narrative into her own hands, a far-cry from the Reputation days, during which she begged to be excluded from it. Her candor in the interview feels an extension of the questions she began to answer with Lover, as well as a call back to the trusting \u201cold Taylor\u201d she tried to bury years ago. She talks a bit about politics, a subject that rivals Kanye West as one of the most controversial aspects of her public image.\n\nOf the political messaging on the Lover track \u201cMiss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince,\u201d Swift says, \u201cI have that line \u2018I see the high-fives between the bad guys\u2019 because not only are some really racist, horrific undertones now becoming overtones in our political climate, but the people who are representing those concepts and that way of looking at the world are celebrating loudly, and it\u2019s horrific.\u201d\n\nSwift skeptics will be pleased to learn that she also finally, unequivocally denounced white supremacy when asked about the white supremacist site that falsely claimed her as one of their own back in 2016. Many were frustrated by her silence at the time, but she tells Rolling Stone that she did not even know about the website in question. Still, she says, \u201cif that happened, that\u2019s just disgusting. There\u2019s literally nothing worse than white supremacy. It\u2019s repulsive. There should be no place for it.\u201d Right now, she\u2019s focused on how she can \u201chelp and not hinder\u201d the Democratic effort in 2020.\n\nSwift\u2019s final statement on politics is a rallying cry for unity. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do anything to change what\u2019s happening, we need to stick together,\u201d the \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d singer says. \u201cWe need to stop dissecting why someone\u2019s on our side or if they\u2019re on our side in the right way or if they phrased it correctly. We need to not have the right kind of Democrat and the wrong kind of Democrat. We need to just be like, \u2018You\u2019re a Democrat? Sick. Get in the car. We\u2019re going to the mall.\u201d", "description": "The pop star opened up to Rolling Stone about politics, her longstanding feud with rapper Kanye West, and the \u201cdisgusting\u201d white supremacists who once claimed she supported them.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568832350/190918-tswift-rollingstone-tease_ibdohj", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
