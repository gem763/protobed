But the inspector general\u2019s intervention makes it clear the article is incorrect on multiple points.\n\nThe office said the form used by the whistleblower to submit the complaint on 12 August this year had been in use since 24 May 2018. First-hand knowledge of an event has never been required for a complaint, it added.\n\n\u201cAlthough the form requests information about whether the Complainant possesses first-hand knowledge about the matter about which he or she is lodging the complaint, there is no such requirement set forth in the statute,\u201d said the statement.\n\nIt added that the whistleblower had, in any case, \u201cstated on the form that he or she possessed both first-hand and other information\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
