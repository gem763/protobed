He said, \u201cThe fourth is already set and has a release date for January, we are very happy.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Money Heist\u2019 season 4 could air sooner than we thought!\n\nA few reports suggest the fourth part of the show will be releasing on January 18, 2020, just six months after the third season arrived.\n\nThe third season of Money Heist started off with the imprisonment of Rio, followed by Professor\u2019s initiative to execute his brother Berlin\u2019s plan of robbing the bank of Spain. However, in the last episode, Professor was tricked into going off-track with his plan after Raquel Murillo got caught.\n\nAs of now, we do not know if the ventures of the Professor and his company will exceed the fourth season, for, the last episode of the third season had been a true cliffhanger. Nevertheless, Money Heist is undisputedly one of the biggest hits of Netflix, especially for a series in a foreign language.\n\nWhat are your views on the story?
