Although 78 per cent of respondents recognized that automation in service fulfillment led to more profitable businesses, two-thirds said that the level of manual intervention had increased either slightly or significantly over the last two years.\n\nWhile the survey found a belief that 14 per cent of fulfillment tasks would always be manual, it also revealed that of the remaining tasks which could be automated, just 25 per cent actually are today.\n\nWhen asked to what extent a one per cent reduction in manual intervention would have on revenues1, respondents said there would be a two per cent gain \u2013 one per cent higher than last year\u2019s result. This equates to USD 12 billion in additional revenues across tier-one and tier-two CSPs worldwide.\n\nCSPs also see the value of automation beyond service fulfillment. Respondents said increasing automation of the configuration and quoting process could increase annual revenues by an average of three per cent \u2013 equating to USD 18 billion globally.\n\nStephen Krajewski, Director of Product Marketing, Sigma Systems, commented: \u201cIt is sobering that at a time when 5G technology, smart cities and the Internet of Everything are becoming a reality, CSPs do not have fully automated processes when increasing automation and reducing manual intervention would have a marked impact on their business. Improving revenues is a constant goal for CSPs, and at Sigma Systems our focus is to help our customers drive business transformation and product innovation by using catalog-driven systems to enable the most efficient end-to-end customer experience.\u201d\n\nFor further information on the second edition of the Create-Sell-Deliver Outlook, go to https://sigma-systems.com/resource/whitepaper-the-create-sell-deliver-outlook-second-edition/, or contact us at info@sigma-systems.com.\n\nAbout Coleman Parkes Research\n\nColeman Parkes Research is a UK-based and technology-focused B2B market research agency that specializes in highly targeted quantitative and qualitative research studies.
