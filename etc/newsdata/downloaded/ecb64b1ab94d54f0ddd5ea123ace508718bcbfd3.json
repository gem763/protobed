(Jon Washer via PA via AP)\n\nOn Sunday morning, Sarah Thomas plunged into the water at Dover, setting out to swim across the English Channel. And then back. And then again. And again.\n\nFifty-four hours and a few minutes later, the breast cancer survivor from Colorado had accomplished a remarkable sports feat, becoming the first person to swim the channel four times in succession, covering 84 miles without a break while treating the body of water like a huge lap pool.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe we did it,\u201d Thomas told the BBC. \u201cI\u2019m really just pretty numb. There was a lot of people on the beach to meet me and wish me well and it was really nice of them, but I feel just mostly stunned.\u201d\n\nSarah Thomas has become the first person to swim the Channel four consecutive times.\n\n\n\nSetting off just after midnight on Sunday, Sarah swam night and day for more than 54 hours, battling the currents for 84 miles.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 Tom Nicholson for @TheTimeshttps://t.co/2hbum9KsOp pic.twitter.com/e0NZktrVJt \u2014 The Times Pictures (@TimesPictures) September 17, 2019\n\nThomas, a 37-year-old American open-water ultra marathon swimmer, finished cancer treatment a year ago and dedicated her swim to \u201call the survivors out there.\u201d She wrapped up the journey Tuesday at 6:30 BST (1:30 a.m. Eastern) at Dover\u2019s Samphire Hoe nature preserve. Because of strong tides, she ended up swimming closer to 130 miles, according to the BBC.\n\n\u201cThis is for those of us who have prayed for our lives, who have wondered with despair about what comes next, and have battled through pain and fear to overcome,\u201d she wrote Saturday on Facebook. \u201cThis is for those of you just starting your cancer journey and those of you who are thriving with cancer kicked firmly into the past, and for everyone in between. This is for our family and friends who held us in their arms and provided the strength and support we needed in the hardest times. This is for those who struggled alongside us, feeling our pain as if it was their own. I\u2019m holding you all in my heart and swimming for our health and futures. We are stronger together, each and every one of us.\u201d\n\nThomas, who grew up in Texas, started planning her swim before her diagnosis. \u201cWe honestly didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d make it this point,\u201d she wrote on Facebook.\n\nThis record-breaking swim through salt water, jelly fish and strong currents deserves a round of applause \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfca\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f.

The Channel can do a lot of crazy things and for this to happen, we\u2019re going to need some luck. \u2026\n\n\u201cEverything has to go right when so much can go wrong. We promise to be safe, but I also promise to give it everything I can. I\u2019ve been waiting for this swim for over two years now and have fought so hard to get here. Am I 100 percent? No. But I\u2019m the best that I can be right now, with what I\u2019ve been through, with more fire and fight than ever.\u201d\n\n\n\nSarah Thomas after her final crossing. (Channel Swimming Academy via Reuters)\n\nThomas carried with her a pebble from a pond in Colorado, saying she couldn\u2019t wait to swap it out after accomplishing her mission. As expected, there were treacherous moments. While nearing landfall late in the swim, the final stretch was marred by \u201cdark, windy and choppy conditions,\u201d according to Elaine Howley, who is working on a documentary about Thomas\u2019s feat. In a post to Facebook, Howley wrote, \u201cInspirational isn\u2019t a big enough word for what\u2019s happening here today.\u201d\n\nAmazing!!! Sarah Thomas is about to become the first person to swim 4 consecutive English Channel crossings.

Many stayed up until the early hours Tuesday morning to be with her when she finished.\n\nThe English Channel, referred to as the busiest maritime route in the world, sees more than 200 ferries and 600 tankers pass through daily, according to the Channel Swimming Association. The group warns of frigid waters that are too cold for sharks, as well as \u201cjellyfish, seaweed and the occasional plank of wood.\u201d\n\nLike thousands of swimmers, Thomas had swum the Channel before, in 2012 and in 2016, but no one had ever swum back and forth four consecutive times. Thomas said her immediate plan, after celebrating with champagne and chocolates, was to sleep all day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty tired right now,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nFrom 2013: Diana Nyad finishes swim from Cuba to Florida on fifth try\n\nSally Jenkins on Diana Nyad: How do you walk from Boston to Maine?
