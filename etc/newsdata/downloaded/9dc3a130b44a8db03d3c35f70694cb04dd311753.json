I don\u2019t think it should be used in news reporting, and I think it weakens commentary. Better just to state the facts and let the reader judge.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

She also called Boris Johnson \u201ca known liar\u201d, which may be true but I think it was unwise for a broadcaster under a legal obligation of impartiality to say so.\n\nAnd when the Channel 4 News team complained that they had travelled to the G7 summit in Biarritz last weekend to interview the prime minister only for his office to cancel, I said I was baffled that they expected him to do otherwise.\n\nYes, the prime minister should be interviewed by all major news organisations. But I do not think that Channel 4 News should be surprised to discover that the prime minister is \u201ctoo busy\u201d if he has just been insulted by the channel\u2019s head of news.\n\nI know that most people do not agree with me about this, but I ask you to consider: where does calling someone a liar get us?\n\nYours,\n\nJohn Rentoul\u200b\n\nChief political commentator", "description": "If I want to render my Twitter account unusable for a few days, all I have to do is to repeat one of my most unpopular opinions, namely that it is a bad idea to use the words \u201clie\u201d or \u201cliar\u201d.\u00a0 My argument is that we do not have windows into each other\u2019s hearts, and so when someone says something that is untrue it is hard to be sure they are doing it deliberately.", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/31/17/liar.jpg"}
