Often, it is by starting your own. The iconic Australian cricket team followed the great West Indies side of the 1980s, Manchester United picked up where Liverpool left off in the 1990s, and Mercedes have done to Red Bull what Red Bull did to Ferrari. Each one on their own, a dynasty.\n\nBut no one has ever stopped New Zealand\u2019s reign. Even when the All Blacks went through their barren run of five World Cup failures in a row, they remained the dominant force in between. No other team has achieved what the All Blacks have over the last 32 years and beyond.\n\nSo how do you end a dynasty? That\u2019s the question that England \u2013 and specifically Eddie Jones \u2013 has been asked over and over again this week. If his team are to live up to his expectation that they can and will win the Rugby World Cup, that is exactly what they have to do on Saturday.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been involved in rugby the country you want to knock off is New Zealand, because they\u2019ve been the best,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd the reason you\u2019re involved in this game is you want to be the best. You\u2019ve got the opportunity to change rugby history on Saturday and the whole team is excited about it.\u201d\n\nMost teams are daunted by this challenge \u2013 or by the aura that surrounds the idea of the All Blacks. Ireland were the most recent side to fall into this trap, having lost last weekend\u2019s quarter-final before it had even kicked off.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is impossible to tell, to be quite frank.\n\nEngland and New Zealand have played each other just once in the last five years, a highly-charged Twickenham encounter that saw the home side race to a 12-0 lead only to succumb to a 16-15 defeat. New Zealand were the better team on the day, but what England did that November afternoon was prove that the All Blacks are vulnerable, if not beatable.\n\nThe difference is that 12 of Steve Hansen\u2019s side already know what it takes to deliver on the biggest stage, having been part of the squad that won the last World Cup on English soil. That is not in an autumn international, or a summer Test match. It is the World Cup, and that is where the pressure builds on England. Hansen was all too pleased to point it out in response to Jones\u2019s barbs earlier in the week that they were being \u201cchased down the street\u201d by the pressure to win a third consecutive Webb Ellis Cup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re under pressure all the time,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cI think early in our history, we ran away from it so it was chasing us down the street. But these days, we\u2019ve had to acknowledge it\u2019s there; now we\u2019re expected to win every game whether it\u2019s a quarter-final, semi-final or just an ordinary Test match. So there is pressure; it\u2019s a big game.\n\n\u201cBut it would be naive to think that there\u2019s not pressure on both sides and, when you can publicly acknowledge that it\u2019s on you, then there\u2019s an awareness \u2013 and that same pressure\u2019s running down the same street [Jones] is on. He\u2019s trying to take pressure off his own side by getting everyone to talk to us about pressure.\n\n\u201cA smart move, but I\u2019m not buying into it, and our players aren\u2019t buying into it. We know we\u2019re under pressure, we don\u2019t need Eddie to tell us that.\n\n\u201cWhat he needs to work out is what are England going to do about the pressure they\u2019re under. Because they\u2019ll have memories about a tournament four years ago that didn\u2019t go that good \u2013they\u2019ll be under immense pressure themselves.\u201d\n\nHansen and Jones may be good friends in and out of the game, but this felt like something personal for the Kiwi coach \u2013 not with the Australian but with England as a whole. It felt like Hansen was trying to say if you want to take us down, you better not miss.\n\nIn the past England have missed \u2013 and missed badly \u2013 but what Jones is pinning his hopes on is that each time they\u2019ve done so under his watch, there has been a way back to the right path.\n\n\u201cOur players have played a lot of big games,\u201d he responded. \u201cEvery game they play in the Six Nations the other country is coming for them. We play Scotland at Murrayfield, they come for us; Ireland at Lansdowne Road, they come for us. Thirteen of our players were involved in the Lions tour. They have big match experience.\n\n\u201cThis is a big game, let\u2019s not doubt that. But the players have had big match experience. They\u2019ve failed, they\u2019ve had success and that\u2019s one of the things I like about this team. If you look over the four years, we\u2019ve had a lot of success, but we\u2019ve had failures. We\u2019ve had to learn from those wins and from those losses, and Saturday it\u2019s going to be tested again.\u201d\n\nAnd the biggest lesson along the way?\n\n\u201cWhen we played New Zealand in November. You\u2019ve got to be alive in every moment of the game and there were times when we weren\u2019t, and we allowed them back in the game. That\u2019s the greatest lesson of all.\u201d\n\nBut the time for lessons is over: it\u2019s exam season, and England face the test they\u2019ve been readying themselves for for two and a half years since the draw was made in Kyoto. Ever since that day, Jones has been targeting this game in the belief that if they can ace this one, they will finally be the best team on the planet, and the truth of it is that they will never have better ingredients to beat the All Blacks than they do now. When you speak to the players, you get the sense that they know that.\n\nIt is a remarkable feat that the same 31 players named two months ago by Jones to embark on this journey remain the 31 still here, all fit for selection for the penultimate weekend of the tournament. No other team left in the tournament can boast such consistency.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak highly enough of the squad, and the work they have been putting in,\u201d said captain Owen Farrell. \u201cFor it to feel the way it has felt up until now, it takes 31 players, and we have got 31 players that have enjoyed the time here, enjoyed the experience of the World Cup, enjoyed spending time together and enjoyed the rugby that\u2019s been out there on the field.\n\n\u201cIt takes some work, that \u2013 it doesn\u2019t just happen and the full 31 lads that have been involved in that have each individually played a massive part in it.\u201d\n\nNow they must all play a part in their biggest achievement yet: beating the best. They may never have a better chance to do so, but while that does not at all mean they will do, that sliver of expectation, rather than hope, makes Saturday\u2019s clash feel like the final that never was.", "description": "How do you end a dynasty?
