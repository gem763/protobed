This was a dumb enough idea when Kamala Harris floated it with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Monday. Harris doubled down on authoritarianism by making the demand official and putting it in writing:\n\nIn a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey dated Tuesday, Harris pointed to six tweets Trump has sent since last Friday that Harris says violated Twitter\u2019s rules. Harris said that Trump has used his account to \u201ctarget, harass, and attempt to out the whistleblower\u201d whose allegations about Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine prompted Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry. \u201cPresident Trump also published the following tweet suggesting that violence could be incited should Congress issue formal articles of impeachment against him,\u201d she wrote, highlighting a tweet Trump sent on Sunday that read: \u201c\u2026.If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d The tweet was a selective quote of a supporter on Fox News. Harris also pointed to tweets Trump sent that said Rep. Adam Schiff should be \u201cquestions at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.\u201d \u201cThese are blatant threats,\u201d Harris wrote to Dorsey, \u201cWe need a civil society, not a civil war.\u201d\n\nIn part, Harris chose this option because she\u2019s getting desperate to reverse her slide in the primaries. As Thomas Lifson wrote after her appearance on Anderson Cooper 360, Harris\u2019 political career is \u201cunraveling under the scrutiny a presidential campaign brings,\u201d at least in terms of presidential politics. She got a momentary reprieve out of attacking Joe Biden for being a racist, which Harris utterly squandered with her Dan Quayle-esque response to Tulsi Gabbard in the next debate. What better way for Harris to look presidential than to demand that Twitter blacklist the president?\n\nActually, there are plenty of ways to look presidential without looking like a tyrant-in-waiting. A civil society would also consist of open dialogue and debate. Deplatforming shuts down that free-speech safety valve if exercised often enough, which then incentivizes other methods of dissent that aren\u2019t as civilized. Why not just put the effort into criticizing the tweets and Trump directly rather than run to Twitter\u2019s Snitch Central over them? Kamala Harris might not be doing well in the presidential election, but she has her own significant platform from which to criticize Trump over these tweets, which are wide open for such criticism.\n\nDorsey deserves plenty of criticism for creating Snitch Central in the first place, where the mere collection of down-twinkles from cranks deplatforms users, either temporarily or occasionally permanently. However, Dorsey can\u2019t possibly be so dense as to lock out his biggest draw. Trump\u2019s tweets might not be the only asset this poisonous platform has, but it\u2019s by far the biggest. Who else constantly puts Twitter in the news every single day? Name any other person on Twitter whose lack of a tweet is news in and of itself. Dorsey can\u2019t afford a Trump-less Twitter, and if Harris doesn\u2019t know that much, she\u2019s not paying attention.\n\nThat makes this demand from Harris not just absurdly authoritarian, but also likely impotent as well. Those aren\u2019t exactly the best looks for a presidential candidate \u2026 as Democratic voters seem to have already concluded about Harris anyway.\n\nElizabeth Warren appears to agree on that point, scoffing at the very idea of a ban:", "description": "Absurd.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/harris-view.png"}
