Justify went on to win the Derby and took the Preakness and Belmont stakes to complete the Triple Crown.\n\nThe Times said instead of a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results. The newspaper also reported that instead of filing a public complaint, the board made decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case and lighten the penalty for horses found to have scopolamine in their systems.\n\nThe newspaper said test results, emails and internal memorandums show how California regulators waited nearly three weeks, until the Kentucky Derby was only nine days away, to notify Baffert of the positive test. Then, two months after the Belmont victory, the board disposed of the inquiry altogether during a closed-door executive session.\n\nThe Times said Baffert didn't respond to multiple attempts seeking comment.\n\nWATCH | Justify becomes 13th horse to win Triple Crown:", "description": "The New York Times says Justify won the 2018 Triple Crown after a failed post-race drug test at a California track that could have kept the horse out of the Kentucky Derby.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4699908.1528589621!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/justify-triple-crown-mike-smith-belmont.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
