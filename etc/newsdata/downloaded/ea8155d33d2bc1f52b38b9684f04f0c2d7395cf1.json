Photo: paul.hollywood / Instagram\n\nIf you have had the soothing joy of watching the Great British Baking Show, you\u2019ll doubtlessly be familiar with Paul Hollywood, an intimidating and somehow unsettlingly erotic presence tasked with sampling various tarts and pastries, as well as chastising unprofessional bakers over \u201csoggy bottoms\u201d and stodgy cakes. What you may not know, however, is that in addition to being a celebrity chef, Hollywood is an artist \u2014 and his medium of choice is Instagram.\n\nThis realization did not come easily to me. Out of the Great British Baking Show\u2019s regular stable of quirky characters, he\u2019s not the most, uh, agreeable. (To his credit, he\u2019s competing with the delightful Mary Berry.) He gets a little too much pleasure out of being the bad-cop judge. He gives off some voted-Leave vibes. Also, his blue eyes are disconcertingly icy. But after going on a deep dive into his personal Instagram, I can come to no other conclusion.\n\nI mean \u2026 he is a man named Paul Hollywood.\n\nHe is a man with the bravery to post thotty selfies. (While he does write comically earnest captions alongside the thirst traps, we all \u2014 myself included \u2014 have our faults.)\n\nAnd he\u2019s a Motorcycle Guy. (If you\u2019re wondering if he self-identifies as a \u201cspeed freak,\u201d you got it, mate \u2014 he bloody does.)\n\nAnd he has the confidence to take an incredibly wide stance, and also to go zip-lining.\n\nAnd I simply cannot look away from his inspiring midlife crisis. Twenty years ago, men in the throes of this state might\u2019ve found themselves drawn to the material comforts of, say, a leather-seated sports car or a woman no more than half their age. To my knowledge, that much hasn\u2019t changed. What has changed, though, is that these agonizing men can now post through their suppressed existential dread on social media. And that is exactly what Mr. Hollywood is doing.\n\nSure, he may possess some of the more unpalatable qualities of an aging dirty dog \u2014 notably, a fondness for uncouth remarks and younger girlfriends \u2014 but I respect that he knows exactly who he is. In fact, in an interview with the Times from July 2017, he went so far as to explicitly admit it: \u201cI think I am perpetually in a midlife crisis.\u201d And I think that\u2019s beautiful.\n\nStay in touch.
