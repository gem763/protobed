Now, that's been made apparent \u2013 and it's clear that \"plus\" is the operative word in the product's title.\n\nAn unwieldy list unveiled by Disney+'s Twitter feed on Monday night showed the sheer extent of Disney titles that will be available through the service, which will cost between \u00a37 and \u00a312.20 a month.\n\nFrom classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio to cult hits (Three Men and a Little Lady) and just the plain forgotten (The Barefoot Executive and The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, anyone?), Disney+ is attempting to whip up excitement with a sprawling show-and-tell of the wares on offer.\n\nOthers may remind viewers of somewhat less enlightened times: 1959 live-action leprechaun caper Darby O'Gill and the Little People, for instance, received even contemporary criticism that \"all attempts at Irish charm seem pretty synthetic\". And 1946's problematic plantation musical Song of The South is conspicuous by its absence.\n\nStill, for those wanting to binge on childhood favourites such as The Sound of Music, 101 Dalmatians or, erm, Million Dollar Duck, they will be able to find them all in one place.", "description": "Ever since Disney announced its own streaming service, Disney+ in April, fans of the House of Mouse have been curious as to what the Netflix-rival will offer.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2019/10/15/Daschund-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZV2pDK2O032dxQ4Rq3zwsPOeCllJRLtnATpqSTRLDUs.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
