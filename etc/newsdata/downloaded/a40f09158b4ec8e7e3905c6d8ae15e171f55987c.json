REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\n\nThe pair have had a testy relationship since Ancelotti took charge last year with Insigne admitting that he often loses his temper with his coach during training.\n\nAncelotti\u2019s patience ran out at the end of September when he left Insigne on the sidelines for two successive games, and the forward also started on the bench for Wednesday\u2019s Champions League match away to Salzburg.\n\nBut the air was cleared after the 28-year-old captain, the only Naples-born player in the squad, came on to score the winner in a thrilling 3-2 victory over the Austrians.\n\n\u201cI have had some disagreements with the coach but it is all water under the bridge, I respect him a lot,\u201d said Insigne.\n\n\u201cHe is a great coach who has always given me confidence and made me feel important. I was wrong in some attitudes I took, I apologised and we cleared things up.\u201d\n\nAncelotti replied: \u201cI had told him before the game that he would play and be decisive - and so it went.\u201d\n\nNapoli, runners-up three times in the last four seasons, are fourth in Serie A, six points behind leaders Juventus, and visit SPAL on Sunday. Juventus are away to promoted Lecce and second-placed Inter Milan are at home to Parma.\n\nInsigne has been at Napoli since he was 15 although he has had loan spells at Cavese, Foggia and Pescara. His low centre of gravity, speed and close control make him a nightmare for defenders and he scores frequently, often with stylish finishes, though his form can suffer lapses.\n\nODD RELATIONSHIP\n\nAncelotti handed him the captaincy in February but his frustration still boils over on occasion.\n\nEven club president Aurelio De Laurentiis stepped in at one point, suggesting that Insigne should calm down. \u201cI understand him, I protect him and I like him a lot, but he\u2019s always found his situation in Naples to be uncomfortable,\u201d he said.\n\nInsigne described his relationship with Ancelotti as \u201ca bit odd\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt times we have had rows, but that\u2019s all down to our respective personalities,\u201d he said this month. \u201cSometimes when I get tired or anxious at training, I might end up responding to his observations, but it ends there.\u201d\n\nInsigne, however, said that people had got the wrong idea about him.\n\n\u201cI seem arrogant to them, I think they have an image of me which is different to how I really am. I want to be close to all the fans because I would die for this shirt,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s also tired of being a runner-up.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for Napoli to win,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting too long now.\u201d", "description": "Peace has been declared between Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti and team captain Lorenzo Insigne, providing a welcome boost for the Italian side as they look to regain lost ground on Serie A leaders Juventus.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444509262&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N17E", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
