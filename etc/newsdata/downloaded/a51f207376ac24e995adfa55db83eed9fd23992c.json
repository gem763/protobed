Thank you,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump said Monday his administration will work with Saudi Arabia to determine who, exactly, is responsible for the Saturday attacks that sent crude prices soaring, though U.S. officials are pointing fingers at Iran.\n\nMr. Trump left no doubt about his mission at the Santa Ana Star Center in Rio Rancho \u2014 he wants to win New Mexico after losing the state to Hillary Clinton by 8 percentage points in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe will win the great state of New Mexico in 2020,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nIt\u2019s part of his campaign\u2019s bid to expand his 2016 victory map and win states that have gone for Democrats in recent presidential cycles.\n\n\u201cWe have to win 2020,\u201d he said, punctuating his point.\n\nBesides New Mexico, the Trump campaign has floated the possibility of nabbing New Hampshire, Colorado, Nevada and Oregon after they eluded the president\u2019s grasp last time.\n\nMr. Trump used his speech to highlight a spike in natural gas production in New Mexico, saying it means \u201cgreat wages\u201d and jobs.\n\nHe said Democratic plans would turn back those gains.\n\nMr. Trump also said his first term has brought great employment numbers for Hispanic Americans.\n\nTo win in New Mexico, analysts say he\u2019ll have to win over Hispanic voters who make up a third of the electorate.\n\nThe campaign insists his economic performance, pro-life stance and pro-legal immigration messages will resonate.\n\nSupporters in view of the TV cameras late Monday wore \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d T-shirts and signs.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Hispanic here?\u201d Mr. Trump said to the cheering crowd.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
