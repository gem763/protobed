I am a senior majoring in Computer Science in University of Washington Seattle. If you could refer me to the job, please message me! Thank you!\u201d\n\nShopify CEO Tobi Lutke wasn\u2019t particularly interested in Ryoo\u2019s education, but he was definitely interested in his history as a professional StarCraft 2 player. Ryoo used to compete under the name \u201cSeleCT\u201d but his twitter bio says he\u2019s retired.\n\nStarcraft is a sci-fi strategy computer game where players collect resources to build armies and destroy their opponents. The game has a deep following, to the extent that it has became a spectator sport with professional players.\n\nA day after he put out the request for job advice, Lutke replied to Ryoo\u2019s tweet, saying, \u2018Hey select. Happy to hire you into the Shopify intern program. Your Starcraft accomplishments are enough of a CV. Place is yours if you want it.\u201d\n\nHey select. Happy to hire you into the Shopify intern program. Your Starcraft accomplishments are enough of a CV. Place is yours if you want it. \u2014 Tobi L\u00fctke (@tobi) October 14, 2019\n\nLutke is fairly active on Twitter, tweeting jokes, talking about video games, and interacting with employees, along with occasionally promoting Shopify-related products and business plans to his 57,000 followers.\n\nOn Monday, Lutke noticed that his job offer to Ryoo had garnered some attention in the StarCraft community Reddit, and he linked to a thread with more than 4,400 upvotes and 300 comments.\n\n\u201cWhen your Twitter messages are trending on reddit,\u201d he said along with a tongue-out emoji.\n\nOver in the Reddit thread, Lutke was talking to StarCraft fans about his hiring practices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insanely hard to become a pro in Starcraft, significantly harder than it is to get a degree. So I feel like this should be highly valuable on a CV. My offer to bring in ex pro players is more general than my offer to select for an internship,\u201d Reddit user \u201cxal\u201d said.\n\nShopify corporate public relations did not respond to a request for comment from the Financial Post about the posts, or confirm their authenticity, but the Xal account has been active on Reddit for 13 years, and multiple posts identify it as Lutke over the years.\n\nThe account history indicates this isn\u2019t even the first time Lutke has tried to hire pro StarCraft players, seven years ago, Xal made a post with the title \u201cStarcraft can land you jobs!\u201d According to archived records on Reddit, the post linked to a since-deleted tweet from Lutke saying, \u201cShopify is looking Programmers/Designers who are Diamond+ Starcraft players to bolster it\u2019s AHGL league team\u201d apparently in reference to an internal team of Starcraft players.\n\nIn the Starcraft comments, Lutke also joked around with other users.\n\nWhen Lutke said he doesn\u2019t have time to run an e-sports team because he\u2019s too busy running Shopify, one Reddit user wrote, \u201cJust get Amazon to acquire you, then start a new esports venture ;).\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather buy amazon later,\u201d Lutke replied.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Ryoo is planning on accepting the internship offer from Lutke, but after the situation got a lot of attention on Reddit, Ryoo posted a screenshot of it on his Instagram account saying, \u201cI just realized this actually has been a huge meme in E-sport and CS community. I can\u2019t thank you enough. Thank you so much Tobi: CEO of Shopify.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: jmcleod@nationalpost.com | Twitter: jamespmcleod", "description": "When Kevin Ryoo sent out a tweet asking for career advice, he probably wasn\u2019t expecting a job offer from Canada\u2019s largest publicly traded tech company", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/lutke.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
