It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided to let political figures lie to you\u2014even about Facebook itself\u2014while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies.\u201d\n\nWe intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook\u2019s ad platform to see if it\u2019d be approved. It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook. Take a look: pic.twitter.com/7NQyThWHgO \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 12, 2019\n\nEric Reif, the campaign\u2019s director of paid media, tweeted that \u201cwe put a little bit of money into a fairly obvious lie (which Facebook still shouldn\u2019t have let us do!) to prove a point.\u201d\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said that the company believes political speech should be protected. \u201cIf Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe company decided in the fall of 2018 that political ads and politicians would not be subject to the third-party fact-checking the company is using to combat misinformation. That policy has drawn a tremendous rebuke, particularly from Democrats in recent weeks after Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a speech last month that \u201cIt is not our role to intervene when politicians speak.\u201d\n\nHe added that: \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to be really clear today \u2013 we do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s remarkably personal offensive against the platform and its high-profile CEO are yet another sign of the backlash against the company among many Democratic lawmakers since the 2016 election. Zuckerberg had been a darling of many Democratic lawmakers prior to the election, even hosting a town hall with former President Barack Obama in 2011 on Facebook\u2019s campus.\n\nBut tensions between Facebook and Warren have been building for months, as the Democratic presidential hopeful campaigned to break-up tech companies like Facebook on anti-trust grounds. Facebook took down ads from Warren about dismantling the company \u2014 initially citing the use of the Facebook logo as a violation of its advertising policies \u2014 but later restored the ads \u201cin the interest of allowing robust debate.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign also purchased a \u201cBreak Up Big Tech\u201d billboard in San Francisco last June while she campaigned there in another poke at Silicon Valley.\n\nBut the hostility spilled into public view in early October after The Verge published audio of the Facebook CEO telling employees over the summer that a Warren administration would likely \u201csuck for us\u201d and pledging to battle legal challenges from her potential Justice Department. \u201c[I]f someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,\u201d he said.\n\nWarren and her campaign seized on the comments, seeming to revel in a public fight with one of the richest corporate executives in America. \u201cIt's clear: Silicon Valley billionaires are willing to sell out our democracy to protect their riches,\u201d she wrote in an email to supporters on October 3rd.\n\nIn a Q & A session the next day that Facebook live-streamed to the public, a Facebook employee asked the CEO how he\u2019d remain impartial in light of Warren\u2019s criticisms.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try not to antagonize her further,\u201d he said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/45/08/d337103d43389b2f28f4cf33b6d1/191012-elizabeth-warren-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
