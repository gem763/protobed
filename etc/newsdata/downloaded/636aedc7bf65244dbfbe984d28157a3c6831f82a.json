In the case, an Ohio jury ruled that Oberlin College should pay $25 million over the college\u2019s role in a smear campaign against local business Gibson\u2019s Bakery.\n\nBreitbart News has reported extensively on Gibson\u2019s Bakery\u2019s legal battle with Oberlin College. Gibson\u2019s Bakery sued the college after administrators engaged in a smear campaign against the bakery, calling it \u201cracist\u201d over an incident at the bakery that involved two black Oberlin students. The problem? Both students admitted in a court of law that race did not play a role in the shopkeeper\u2019s response to their shoplifting attempt.\n\nOberlin argues that the verdict poses a threat to the First Amendment. Oberlin hired First Amendment attorneys Lee Levine and Seth Berlin, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, to defend them in the upcoming appeal.\n\n\u201cThe verdict and judgment in this case set a precedent that endangers free speech on campuses and for all Americans,\u201d Levine said in a comment used in the press release. \u201cThe jury was allowed to award substantial damages for speech that is protected by the Constitution. The case should absolutely be reviewed by an appellate court.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Sass\u00e9, an appellate attorney who will also work with Oberlin\u2019s legal team, argues that Ohio\u2019s free speech protections should have kept the case out of court from the beginning.\n\n\u201cThis case never should have gone to the jury in light of the heightened speech protections in the Ohio Constitution, and the trial court made several procedural errors during trial that led to this verdict. Among other things, those errors prevented jurors from hearing critical information about the original incident,\u201d Sass\u00e9 said in a short comment.\n\nGibson Bakery\u2019s attorney Lee Plakas has a different perspective on the case. Plakas argued this week that Oberlin is \u201chiding behind\u201d the First Amendment as a means of defending their abuse of Gibson\u2019s Bakery.\n\n\u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict sent a clear message that institutions like Oberlin College should not be permitted to bully others while hiding behind the claimed shield of free speech,\u201d Plakas told a local reporter. \u201cThere are no exemptions from the law of defamation \u2013 a fact we trust will be confirmed during the appeal process.\u201d\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "Oberlin College announced this week that it is filing an appeal on the Gibson's Bakery defamation case, which resulted in a $25 million jury verdict against the school.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/gibsons-bakery-legal-battle-oberlin-college-file-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
