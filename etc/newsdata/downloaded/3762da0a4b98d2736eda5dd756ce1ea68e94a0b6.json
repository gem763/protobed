The Constitution does not address profits, it addresses any present, as in a gift, any emolument as in cash of any kind whatever. I\u2019m quoting the emoluments clause, from any king, prince or foreign state.\u201d\n\nExplaining that this wouldn\u2019t be an issue if this were a meeting of U.S. government officials, Napolitano once again stated that the emoluments clause is to prevent the president from receiving gifts or cash from foreign entities.\n\n\u201cHe has bought himself an enormous headache now with the choice of this,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is about as direct and profound a violation of the emoluments clause as one could create.\u201d\n\nCavuto, meanwhile, went on to say that there will also be a \u201cspillover effect,\u201d asserting that the Doral resort will become a greater attraction in the future because it hosted the international summit.\n\nNapolitano, who in recent months has assessed that the president has engaged in numerous unethical and criminal activities, observed that this is \u201cexactly what the emoluments clause was written to prohibit.\u201d", "description": "\u201cHe has bought himself an enormous headache now,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cThis is about as direct and profound a violation of the emoluments clause as one could create.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571338554/cavuto-coast-coast_6_krrjzi", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
