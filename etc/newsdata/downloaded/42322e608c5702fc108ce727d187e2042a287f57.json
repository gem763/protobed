Weinstein, 67, scheduled for trial on criminal charges in January, has denied ever sexually assaulting anyone.\n\nTwohey recalled Paltrow\u2019s story of a July 2015 incident in which \u201cHarvey Weinstein showed up to a party at her house early, and she was sort of forced to hide in the bathroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cGwyneth [Paltrow] was actually one of the first people to get on the phone and she was determined to help this investigation even when Harvey Weinstein showed up to a party at her house early and she was sort of forced to hide in the bathroom.\u201d -@mega2e pic.twitter.com/cDizgIn3V7 \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) September 9, 2019\n\nThe party, at Paltrow\u2019s home in the Hamptons, was around the time the actor had begun speaking with reporters. Kantor wrote that she realized Paltrow had been trying to reach her when she saw \u201ca series of panicked text messaged and missed calls\u201d on her phone.\n\nPaltrow, attempting to hide that she was in contact with the reporter, suspected Weinstein had showed up let her know that he was watching, according to the book. Still, Paltrow decided to remain at the house, and the \u201cparty unfolded without incident,\u201d the book says.\n\n\u201cI think Harvey Weinstein was extremely aware and extremely scared of what the implications would be if his biggest star actually ended up going on the record,\u201d Twohey said Monday.\n\nNBC reported Weinstein responded to a request for comment with a statement.\n\n\u201c\u2018She Says\u2019 is all you need to know to appreciate that this book contains one sided allegations without having adequately investigated the facts of each situation,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is very different side to every story.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Kantor and Twohey disclosed Paltrow\u2019s account of a meeting with Weinstein early in her career, when she was in her early-20s.\n\n\u201cShe had a fax from her agent saying here\u2019s where you need to show up,\u201d Kantor said. \u201cSo, she went to the hotel room. The meeting was pretty unremarkable. But at the end of it, she says he actually put his hands on her and said, \u2018Let\u2019s finish in the bedroom.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaltrow said she refused, and later confided in then-boyfriend Brad Pitt, who confronted Weinstein. Weinstein later warned Paltrow she could lose her career if the story got out, according to Kantor.\n\n\u201cShe Said\u201d also describes Weinstein\u2019s efforts to thwart the journalists\u2019 investigation, including the use of high-profile lawyer Lisa Bloom. In 2016, Bloom offered to gin up bad press about actor Rose McGowan, who accused Weinstein of raping her at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival.", "description": "The now-disgraced movie mogul showed up early for a party at Paltrow's house, according to the book \"She Said,\" by reporters who broke the Weinstein story.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d768011240000d32677c89c.jpeg?cache=jgdcgbymtm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
