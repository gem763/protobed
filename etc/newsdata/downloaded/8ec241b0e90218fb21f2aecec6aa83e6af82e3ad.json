Learn what you can do to reduce your own single-use plastics, and take your pledge. Join a conversation with Kathryn Kellogg on zero waste on Reddit at 2 pm ET May 18.\n\nAnd yet there are a growing number of people\u2014often young millennial women\u2014who are part of a zero-waste movement. Their yearly trash output can be small enough to fit inside an eight-ounce mason jar. These are not wannabe hippies, but people embracing a modern minimalist lifestyle. They say it saves them money and time and enriches their lives.\n\nView Images Kathryn Kellogg is a zero-waste blogger who shares her experiences trying to use as little packaging and single-use plastic as possible. She lives in Vallejo, California, with her husband Justin Norton. Photograph by Randy Olson, National Geographic\n\nKathryn Kellogg is one of those young millennials who has downsized her trash pile\u2014anything that hasn\u2019t been composted or recycled\u2014so two years' worth literally fits inside one 16-ounce jar. Meanwhile, the average American produces 1,500 pounds of trash a year. (Learn more about Kellogg in the recent plastic issue of National Geographic magazine.)\n\n\u201cWe also saved about $5,000 a year by purchasing fresh food instead of packaged, buying in bulk, and making our own products like cleaners and deodorant,\u201d says Kellogg, who lives with her husband in a small house in Vallejo, California.\n\nKellogg is one of several zero-waste bloggers who share online the details of their efforts, along with practical tips and encouragement, for others looking to embrace a zero-waste lifestyle. In three years, she has gained 300,000 monthly readers on her blog goingzerowaste.com and on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI think many people are ready to cut their waste,\u201d says Kellogg. However, she doesn\u2019t want people to fixate on trying to stuff all their trash into a jar. Zero-waste is really about trying to minimize your trash and making better choices in your life, she says. \u201cJust do the best you can and buy less.\u201d\n\nA Thriving Community\n\nA breast cancer scare in college led Kellogg to start reading labels on personal-care products and finding ways to limit her exposure to potentially toxic chemicals. She found alternatives and started making her own products. Like her own readers, Kellogg learned from others, including New York City\u2019s Lauren Singer, who has the very popular Trash is for Tossers blog. Singer started reducing her waste footprint as an environmental studies student in 2012 and has turned zero-waste into a career as a speaker, consultant, and retailer. She has two stores dedicated to making trash-free living easier for everyone.\n\nPlastics 101\n\nThere\u2019s an active zero-waste community online sharing ideas, challenges, and support for those struggling with unhelpful friends and family who think it\u2019s weird to worry about trash. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear of being rejected when you try to do things differently,\u201d Kellogg says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a radical act to clean up a kitchen spill with a cloth towel instead of a paper towel.\u201d\n\nMany of the solutions to cutting waste use practices that were commonplace before the era of plastics and disposable products. Think cloth napkins and handkerchiefs, vinegar and water for cleaning, glass or stainless-steel containers for left-overs, cloth grocery bags. These, and similar old-school solutions, produce no waste and are cheaper in the long run.\n\nQuestioning What\u2019s Normal\n\nGoing zero-waste means questioning what\u2019s normal and thinking outside the box, Kellogg says. As one example, she mentions that she loves tortillas but hates making them. But as part of her zero-waste quest, she didn\u2019t want to buy packaged ones at the grocery. Eventually, she hit on the solution: buy a bunch of fresh-made ones from her local Mexican restaurant. The restaurant was even happy to put the tortillas in Kellogg\u2019s container because it saves them money.\n\n\u201cMany such solutions to waste are insanely simple,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd any step to reduce waste is a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nCincinnati\u2019s Rachel Felous took more than a few steps in January 2017 and cut her waste to one bag for the year. Felous was surprised and delighted with the impact it\u2019s had on her life.\n\nView Images Residents drop off materials at the new Zero Waste Center in Vancouver, Canada, in March 2018. The center is a one-stop household garbage collection site where residents can drop off waste for reuse or recycling, in order to help reduce the amount going to landfills. Photograph by Liang Sen, Xinhua News Agency\n\n\u201cGoing zero waste has been great,\u201d she says. \u201cI found an amazing community, made new friends, and new opportunities have come my way,\u201d says Felous.\n\nAlthough an environmentally aware nature lover, Felous hadn\u2019t really thought about how much waste she produced until she moved. That\u2019s when she realized how much stuff she\u2019d accumulated, including a dozen half-used bottles of shampoo and conditioners. Not long after reading an article on zero-waste she vowed to take more responsibility for her own footprint. Felous also documents her struggles, challenges, and successes on Instagram during her quest to slash the trash.\n\nBy weight 75 to 80 percent of all household trash is organic matter that can be composted and turned into soil. As an apartment dweller, Felous deals with her organic waste by putting it in the freezer. Once a month, she takes her frozen lump to her parent\u2019s house, where a local farmer picks it up to feed animals or for composting. If the organic waste went to a landfill it likely wouldn\u2019t compost, because air can\u2019t circulate enough there.\n\nFelous, who runs her own web design and photography business out of her home, advises others to approach zero waste with small steps and show themselves kindness. Making a lifestyle change is a journey, it doesn't happen overnight. But it\u2019s worth the effort, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t start sooner.\u201d\n\nA Regular Family\n\nShawn Williamson started ten years ago. While his neighbors in the suburbs outside of Toronto drag three or four bags of trash to the curb on cold winter nights, Williamson stays warm inside watching hockey on TV. Williamson, his wife, and daughter have taken just six bags of trash to the curb in those 10 years. \u201cWe live a very normal life. We\u2019ve just eliminated waste,\u201d he says.\n\nContrary to what most people think, cutting out waste isn\u2019t a lot of work, he adds. \u201cWe buy in bulk to cut down on shopping trips, which saves us money and time,\u201d Williamson says.\n\nThe only unusual thing about their small, 20-year old house is the amount of shelving used to store bulk purchases of rice, flour, dried beans, nuts, toilet paper, and other products\u2014enough to avoid going shopping for a month, he estimates. \u201cIt\u2019s not cluttered. I still park my car in the garage.\u201d\n\nWilliamson, a business consultant specializing in sustainability, says his goal is simply to be less wasteful in all aspects of life. \u201cIt\u2019s a mindset of looking for better ways of doing things. Once I figure it out there\u2019s little effort to maintain it,\u201d he says.\n\nIt helps that his community has a good recycling program for plastics, paper, and metals and he has room in his backyard for two small composters\u2014one for summer and winter\u2014that produce lots of rich earth for his garden. For everything else, he shops carefully to avoid waste and notes that throwing things out costs money: packaging pushes up the cost of the product, and then we pay for disposal of packaging in our taxes, he says.\n\nBuying local makes it easier to buy foods and other products without packaging, from meat to soap. And when there is no choice, he leaves the packaging behind at the checkout counter. Stores can often reuse or recycle it, and leaving it sends a message: many customers don\u2019t want their avocados wrapped in plastic.\n\nView Images These peppers packaged in plastic are for sale in north London. But 42 firms, responsible for 80 percent of plastic packaging sold in Britain, have signed a pact that aims to reduce plastic pollution over the next seven years through a series of measures. Photograph by Daniel Leal-Olivas, AFP/Getty\n\nEven after ten years of slashing waste, new ideas still pop into Williamson\u2019s head. And here he means waste in the broader sense\u2014not getting a second car that\u2019s parked 95 percent of the day, or shaving in the shower to save time. His advice: take a good look at what you might be wasting in your life. \u201cIf you eliminate it, you\u2019ll have a happier and more profitable life,\u201d he says.\n\nFive Principles of Zero-waste From the Experts*\n\n1. Refuse - refuse to buy things with lots of packaging\n\n2. Reduce - don\u2019t buy things you don\u2019t really need\n\n3. Reuse - repurpose worn out items, shop for used goods, and purchase reusable products like steel water bottles\n\n4. Compost - up to 80 percent of waste by weight is organic. But this rarely decomposes in landfills\n\n5. Recycle \u2013 It still takes some energy and resources to recycle, but it\u2019s better than sending stuff to the landfill or allowing it to become litter\n\n*These are listed in order of importance\n\nEditor's note: We corrected the spelling of Kathryn's name from an earlier version of this story.", "description": "The growing zero-waste community is radically slashing their waste output, while living more fulfilling lives.", "authors": ["Photograph Randy Olson", "National Geographic", "Photograph Liang Sen", "Xinhua News Agency", "Photograph Daniel Leal-Olivas", "Afp Getty"], "top_image": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2018/05/18/zero-waste-family/02-zero-waste-plastic.ngsversion.1526639404723.adapt.1900.1.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-18"}
