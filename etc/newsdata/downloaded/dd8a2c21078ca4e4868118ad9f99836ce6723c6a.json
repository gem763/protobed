Recommendations are separate from any business incentives.\n\nWow, educational toys have changed a lot since I was a kid. I remember inserting floppy disks (!) into a computer in order to play classic games like \u201cNumber Munchers\u201d and \u201cThe Oregon Trail\u201d. I learned very quickly that \u201cDog\u201d was not a day of the week, and that it was very easy to die of wasting diseases in the western US in the 19th century.\n\nFlash forward to today, where the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d and the next tech gadget rule the day. As the world becomes more and more digitally inclined, parents and teachers alike want toys that teach kids computer-and technology-related skills, both for their future employability and for being a citizen in a society built on 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s.\n\nOne emerging trend is toys that teach kids how to write computer programming code. Coding is becoming essential knowledge because the world runs on computers, and computers themselves run on code. As a person with a degree in a STEM field, I had to learn how to code later in life, and it was a miserably long learning curve (even if it\u2019s one of my favorite things to do now). So, naturally, these coding toys aimed at kids piqued my interest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI (with the help of some curious kids and parents) investigated 26 toys and games (covering an age range from 3 years old to adulthood) that claim to teach coding skills in fun and novel ways. To check out our experiences with a wide variety of robots and board games (arranged in increasing age appropriateness), keep scrolling.\n\n(For additional resources on coding for kids, check this site out.)\n\n1. A coding caterpillar for the littlest programmers\n\nAges: 3-8 years old\n\nApp: Code-a-Pillar (iOS/Android) (optional; not needed to play with the toy)\n\nPower: 4 AA batteries\n\nParental involvement needed: Minimal, once the basics are established and the toy is assembled\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations\n\nHow it works: This is coding at its most basic. The Think & Learn Code-a-Pillar has a motorized, caterpillar-shaped head, and kids can make it move in different directions or complete certain actions by adding a variety of pieces to the body of the Code-a-Pillar. Changing the order of the body parts changes the Code-a-Pillar\u2019s routine.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Dave Kender\n\nEach command module lights up as the Code-a-Pillar completes that action, often while catchy music plays. Once the sequence is complete, and the Code-a-Pillar has wiggled all over your living room, all of the modules light up, and a \u201csuccess\u201d music clip plays.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe different actions and motions are \u201cmove forward\u201d, \u201cturn left\u201d, \u201cturn right\u201d, and \u201cplay music\u201d. Expansion packs include additional actions like \u201cplay sleepy music\u201d and \u201cplay excited music\u201d.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nOur experience: The Code-a-Pillar is just so adorable. The different Code-a-Pillar body parts are big, colorful, and kid-friendly. Children just getting the hang of hand-eye coordination and with minimal hand strength may need some help from parents with assembly, but once the Code-a-Pillar is all put together, it\u2019s just a push-and-play experience from there.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe music that accompanies the Code-a-Pillar is pretty loud, so be sure to not blast it right next to sensitive little ears. The Code-a-Pillar motors right along on very thin carpet, but does best on hard floor surfaces.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Dave Kender\n\nFor more advanced playing, the Code-a-Pillar also comes with \u201cStart\u201d and \u201cFinish\u201d disks at which kids can aim the Code-a-pillar. This requires a bit more experimentation (and a longer attention span) because it\u2019s not immediately apparent how much distance the Code-a-Pillar covers in a given action.\n\nThe Code-a-Pillar app doesn't control the Code-a-Pillar toy, but instead acts as a tutorial on how to use the Code-a-Pillar through a series of games.\n\nThe bottom line: The Code-a-Pillar is lots of fun for families with curious toddlers and plenty of open floor space.\n\nBuy the Think and Learn Code-a-Pillar for $50\n\n2. A cute wooden robot for younger kids\n\nAges: 3+ years old\n\nApp: N/A\n\nPower: 6 AA batteries\n\nParental involvement needed: Some for teaching the basics and beyond the basics, some for reading the storybook if a kid is too young to read\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, functions, function calls\n\nHow it works: The Cubetto playset has four main components:\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nCubetto, a small wooden robot\n\nCommand tiles and control box\n\nA fabric playmat with a grid of Cubetto\u2019s world\n\nA storybook describing Cubetto's adventures on the grid squares of the playmat\n\nAfter pairing Cubetto and the control box, commands are routed to Cubetto by placing command tiles in a certain order on the control box, and then pressing the large blue button. Cubetto then navigates the grid on the playmat following the commands on the control board.\n\nThe last row on the control board is reserved for defining a function, which is a sequence of actions that can be called repeatedly from the main control board without having to add tiles for that sequence manually each time. Kids use the tiles to guide Cubetto through the adventures mentioned in the storybook.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe different tiles represent \u201cmove forward\u201d, \u201cturn left\u201d, \u201cturn right\u201d, and \u201cfunction call\u201d. Expansion packs include more \u201cfunction call\u201d tiles, \u201copposite\u201d and \u201crandom\u201d tiles, and additional playmats and storybooks.\n\nOur experience: I have never wanted to hug a small wooden box with a smile on it before, but I guess there\u2019s a first time for everything. From the basic shapes of the tiles to the bright colors on the playmat, Cubetto is perfect for little kids. The storybook is full of neat illustrations and directions to help Cubetto get to his next destination, but thanks to the little cartoon drawings of the start and end grid squares, even kids who can\u2019t yet read can still follow along.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Dave Kender\n\nCubetto moves slowly and quietly from one grid square to the next, making it easy for small children to track the movement. The playmat is fairly stiff fabric, and we recommend placing it on a hard floor surface for optimal Cubetto movement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOur testers reported that the kids needed a lot of instruction and guidance up front, but that once they got going, Cubetto was \"a very rich experience.\" The storybook aspect really lends a sense of urgency to the toy, making kids really want to help Cubetto reach its destination.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Dave Kender\n\nOne potential difficulty parents may have with this toy (and any other robot aimed at toddlers) is teaching their young children the concept of relative directions. The fact that \"right\" and \"left\" depend on which way the robot is facing may take a bit of explanation from parents.\n\nThe bottom line: Cubetto is an awesome copilot on your kid's journey to becoming a junior programmer.\n\nBuy Cubetto for $225\n\n3. A screen-free card game perfect for those who love turtles with laser beams\n\nAges: 4+ years old\n\nApp: N/A\n\nPower: N/A\n\nParental involvement needed: Moderate; some for teaching the basics and beyond the basics, some to actually move the game pieces\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, functions, function calls\n\nHow it works: Robot Turtles is a board game that beautifully demonstrates the basics of coding. Each player is given a \"robot turtle\" tile, which depicts a turtle with a laser mounted on its back (obviously). Using cards representing motions or actions, the colorful turtles must navigate the gridded game board to find the jewel at the center of the board.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nUp to four turtles can play the game at the same time; however, the Robot Turtles instruction manual advocates for collaboration (and cheering) rather than competition between players.\n\nThe different cards represent \"forward\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\", \"laser beam\", and \"function call\". The different obstacles include \"crates\" (which can be pushed, but not pulled), \"ice castles\" (which can be melted via laser beam), and \"stone castles\" (which are permanent, immovable obstacles).\n\nOne key part of this game is that an adult or an older kid must be on hand to set up the obstacle course for the turtles, as well as to move the turtles according to the cards put down by the kids. I suspect that the adults, rather than the younger participants, are asked to actually move the turtle tiles because kids may not admit to a card mistake that has them facing a stone castle, rather than the jewel.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAt any point while the adult is moving a player's turtle, that player is allowed to slap the \"bug\" tile, and shout \"Bug!\" if they spot an error in their card sequence, and get a chance to redo their turtle's motion on that turn. I wish coding bugs would make themselves as obvious in real life.\n\nOur experience: Robot Turtles is a really neat, screen-free experience for both parents and kids. This game involves moderate parental involvement, so we definitely recommend saving Robot Turtles for family game night, or other instances where parents can devote their full attention to playing this game with their kids.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nOne cool part about Robot Turtles is that multiple kids can play at the same time, and it's very easy to set different turtles up with obstacle levels of varying difficulty on the same board. This way, both younger and older children can be challenged while playing the same game.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nAlso, because of the instant feedback between playing the movement/action cards and seeing the turtle move through the obstacle course, this game is a great way to see that \"ah-ha!\" epiphany moment on a kid's face when they understand how the cards actually drive the robot turtles through the maze.\n\nThe stated age range of 4+ is correct; while all kids will love learning the basics and hearing adults make hilarious turtle noises, older children or more advanced coders may soon surpass the higher levels of Robot Turtles, and may want to move on to more complex methods of coding games and toys.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nThe bottom line: Robot Turtles is a fun way for small children and parents to play together while learning the basics of computer programming.\n\nBuy Robot Turtles for $25\n\n4. A high tech robot that can climb a white-board\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAges: Ages 4+\n\nApp: Root Coding app (iOS/not yet available on Android)\n\nSubscription service: Root Academy, $4.99 per month, first month\u2019s subscription free\n\nPower: Internal battery and charger included, connected via Bluetooth\n\nParental involvement needed: moderate for identifying the robot\u2019s various sensors and coding basics, minimal once user is familiar with Root and coding basics are established\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, logical operators, conditional statements, wait for input, loops, functions\n\nHow it works: Using Root Robotic\u2019s block coding system and extremely thorough coding lessons, children as young as four years old can start driving and drawing with this robot.\n\nOur experience: Root is a robot with a streamlined interface that appeals to young children and an extremely customizable robotics experience that appeals to even the most experienced of coders.\n\nThe deceptively simple-looking robot has bumper sensors, touch sensors, light sensors, a surface sensor (to prevent Root from falling off of any edges) and a color sensor. My italicizing of the last four words in that sentence indicate my sheer incredulity at how many sensors Root Robotics was able to pack into this robot.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nEven beyond the sensors, Root is also able to raise and lower a marker (placed in a hole in the middle of the robot) or a marker eraser on command so that Root can draw on the included foldable whiteboard grid, and ostensibly clean up after itself. More on that later.\n\nOf course, all of the sensors and extra features in the world aren\u2019t any fun if you can\u2019t do anything with them. This is where the Root Coding app comes in. After connecting over Bluetooth and naming your robot (mine was named Banjo, obviously), the coding adventure begins. The app has three modules: Learn, Explore, and Code.\n\n\u201cExplore\u201d is a place where Root Robotics can showcase new and exciting projects. Users will find freestyle coding in the \u201cCode\u201d module, and structured lessons in the \u201cLearn\u201d module. If you jump straight to the \u201cCode\u201d module, you may be surprised by how few code blocks there are, but never fear, the level of customizability in each individual code block is nearly overwhelming.\n\nMaking Root\u2019s two bumper sensors respond separately is one thing.\n\nYou can also control Root\u2019s individual wheel speeds.\n\nWhen you make Root sing a song, you get to pick the octave, musical note, and note duration for each tone. That's pretty hardcore.\n\nIt\u2019s in the \u201cLearn\u201d section where kids find out about the frankly staggering number of ways they can alter each code block to make Root do everything from have a dance party to navigate an obstacle course to drawing an arc on the whiteboard grid.\n\nAs for the lessons themselves, I was surprised by how slowly they progressed until I remembered that this app is aimed at teaching four-year-olds how to code; it\u2019s very appropriate for young children just learning the fundamentals of programming.\n\nOne important point to note is that Root Robotics is part of a subscription service; you can only access the first few lessons in the \u201cLearn\u201d module without joining Root Academy, which costs $4.99 per month. Only through Root Academy can you unlock further lessons for Root. It\u2019s also a good way to stay updated as to new code releases; you can just be informed via the app and start using new code right away.\n\nAnother clever aspect of the app is that with a tap of a button, you can swap your code style display from simple blocks to a more graphical interface to full text coding. This will help your kid to see how to start taking the coding principles they\u2019ve learned, and what they look like in Swift, a coding language people use in real life. As the Root Robotics website says, translation into Python and JavaScript are forthcoming (as is the Root Coding app for Android).\n\nThe Root Coding app allows you to test your code before you actually run it with the Root Robot.\n\nAs they progress further in the lessons, though, you will really come to appreciate the area where you can test out your code in the app, and not have it run before you\u2019ve checked it thoroughly. This is especially important when kids are doing art endeavors with Root. Parents will appreciate kids finding and fixing any mistakes before actually running the code, and having Root end up drawing on the dining room floor, rather than the whiteboard grid.\n\nThe whiteboard grid itself is lightweight and foldable. Complete with reusable cling stickers (the particular colors of which Root can sense as it drives over them with its color sensor), both Root and the whiteboard grid are easily decorated and highly portable. I will say that the onboard marker eraser isn\u2019t especially effective on the whiteboard grid. Be sure to wipe away any marker residue that Root misses with the included cloth.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe eraser is, however, much more effective when Root is running on a mounted whiteboard. Yes, that\u2019s right, with a strong magnet, Root can defy gravity and actually move around on a metal-framed whiteboard mounted on your wall.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nRoot can do so many amazing things, but I did have a couple of minor complaints. Both the robot and the app were a bit buggy at times; the first time I turned Root on, it didn\u2019t sing its introductory song on demand. In the app, the bar with the code blocks would sometimes disappear, and coding blocks would occasionally get stranded in the middle of the code space and not react to finger taps. These problems were all easy solved by rebooting both the robot and the app.\n\nOne other minor quibbles involve the fact that, instead of just having each program finish running by itself, you have to manually hit the \u201cstop\u201d button on your codes after you run them. If you forget to do so, you can feel the same guilt I felt after Root kept flashing a purple light for the 10 minutes it took for me to make changes to my project, look up, and realize that Root was still doing a light show.\n\nThe bottom line: The Root Robotics is an easy and fun way for young children to learn how to code, yet it\u2019s complex enough that it can keep older kids and parents interested as well. With Root, the possibilities are literally endless. Be aware that you can\u2019t progress very far in the \u201cLearn\u201d module without the Root Academy subscription service before you buy Root Robotics.\n\nBuy Root Robotics for $200\n\n5. A robot that can keep up with your kid's action figures\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAges: 4+ years old\n\nApp: Coji (iOS/Android) for older kids, pairing via Bluetooth\n\nPower: 3 AAA batteries\n\nParental involvement needed: Minimal for non-coding play, moderate for coding play in app\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, macros\n\nNote: Elmoji appears to no longer be available for purchase; however, Coji is still widely available.\n\nHow it works: Elmoji is the latest version of Coji, an emoji-themed robot aimed at young kids.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nWhile primarily driven by activities via the Coji app, the app-free experience may be the best way for toddlers to play with Elmoji/Coji. Using the buttons on the left and right hand sides of Elmoji's head, children can scroll through a slew of emojis, then push down on Elmoji's head to select one. Elmoji, as though in a game of Charades, promptly acts out that emoji to the best of its ability. For example, activating the \"roller coaster\" emoji causes Elmoji to dance erratically while playing a sound clip of screaming people.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nFor older kids, the \"Free Play\" part of the Coji app offers a way for users to write code for Elmoji and make it perform a sequence of motions or display certain emojis. Users tap to add motions and emojis, and after being paired with a device via Bluetooth, Elmoji receives and enacts the code from the app.\n\nElmoji will follow the coded sequence of events.\n\nFor a bigger challenge, in the \"Command Center\" part of the app, kids can actually code and upload macros (mini-programs) into Elmoji, so that even if Elmoji isn't currently connected to the app, it can still perform the actions and emojis in that macro sequence.\n\nThis motion/emoticon sequence was coded into the #3 macro spot.\n\nThe six modules in the Coji app are \"Free Play\", \"Command Center\", \"Macro Maze\" (uses emojis, motions, and macros to navigate a maze), \"Sequence Says\" (a game like \"Simon Says\", but with emojis), \"Loop Run\" (a game like Super Mario Brothers, but you push Elmoji's head down to jump), and \"Drive\" (controlling Elmoji's motions and emojis manually).\n\nThe Elmoji app is a simpler version of the Coji app, and is meant for younger children; the emojis are Sesame Street flavored, rather than just normal emojis.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe modules in the Elmoji app include \"Free Play\", \"Drive Mode\", \"Memory Match\", and \"Mystery Mazes\", which are simpler versions of the \"Free Play\", \"Drive\", \"Sequence Says\", and \"Macro Maze\" modules in the Coji app, and \"Music Maker\", where kids can tap on colorful xylophone keys to play music through Elmoji.\n\nOur experience: Elmoji is fast. We recommend playing with Elmoji on the floor, since otherwise, Elmoji tends to take headers off of table edges with terrifying regularity.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe fact that mini-programs can be uploaded into Elmoji is very cool, and is sure to help kids understand the time-saving aspect of macros (calling on a set of actions repeatedly vs. coding those actions in manually over and over again).\n\nWhile the Elmoji robot is the big selling point, the fact that the Coji app can be used without Elmoji is a nice benefit for parents, who don't have to worry about forgetting to bring Elmoji everywhere.\n\nThe \"Macro Maze\" game can be played without the Elmoji robot.\n\nThe bottom line: Both Elmoji and the Coji app will make for hours of unintentional learning for kids old and young alike.\n\nBuy Coji for $60\n\n6. Build robots and learn to code in augmented reality\n\nAges: Ages 4+ years\n\nApp: Botzees AR (Android/iOS) (Compatible only with devices with operating systems more recent than (and including) iOS 12 or Android 8.0.)\n\nPower: Power block with USB charger, connected via Bluetooth\n\nParental involvement needed: minimal, once the basics are established and kids have experience assembling the blocks\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, conditional statements, loops\n\nHow it works: Botzees is a fun robot-building kit that will teach your children coding basics while allowing them to explore an augmented reality (AR) world full of fun new friends.\n\nOur experience: If you want your kids to spend their screen time on activities that are both fun and educational, you won\u2019t be disappointed with Botzees. With its easy-to-build robots, fun plot, and coding tasks disguised as neat puzzles, the Botzees robots and app are a recipe for success.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe Botzees kit is made up of 130 pieces that can be used to build 6 pre-designed robots (including a truck, a monkey musician, and a dog) and an infinite number of free-form robots or characters. The pieces are large, colorful, and durable; they snap together and disassemble easily. The three most important components are the power unit, the motor, and the light/motion sensor. The power unit takes about one hour to charge, and the motor and light/motion sensor plug into the power unit. To control the robots you build, you must connect to the power block via Bluetooth (and have to reconnect every time you leave and reopen the app).\n\nIn the Botzees AR app, there are four modules: Play, Build, Code, and Control.\n\nThe Play module is where most of the action happens. After entering the Play module, you\u2019re instantly drawn into an animated adventure where a robot civilization crash-lands their spaceship on a planet populated by helpful purple beings. Kids are tasked with building a robot, and then face coding challenges with that robot in an AR environment. Solving a coding puzzle means finding more spaceship parts and building more complicated robots to take on more complex coding challenges.\n\nYour first task is to build a robot. The assembly instructions are a series of diagrams (similar to the diagrams used in LEGO kits) that you can scroll through; it\u2019s easy to go back a few steps or repeat the previous step without losing your place. You can also rotate the diagram by dragging it, so you can see the pieces from multiple angles. I needed to use this option a few times, since some of the pieces look alike, and I\u2019d accidentally used the wrong pieces in a couple of places. Parents\u2014it might be worth it to sit in on the first few robot build-outs so that you can make sure that younger kids won\u2019t have difficulty differentiating a 2 x 4 piece from a 2 x 6 piece.\n\nAfter you finish building a robot, the app asks you to aim your device\u2019s camera at a large, flat area. While the area it eventually highlights won\u2019t always perfectly match the room\u2019s contours, the app is usually pretty good at identifying flat areas. You will have to initially clear the area of all objects, though, since the app interprets any objects in the flat area as no-go zones. Once the app identifies the flat area, you can manually adjust the boundaries of the play area to maximize the space. While I\u2019d definitely recommend using Botzees on a flat floor surface, it can be used on a desk (which is what I did), so long as you identify the edges of the table as the limits of the play area.\n\nThe next step is to place the robot inside the play area, let your device scan the robot again, and you\u2019re good to go. After a scene or two that explains your task, the helpful purple beings give you the specific coding sequence you have to emulate, and it\u2019s up to you to replicate those results with the coding blocks you have available. By solving the puzzle (i.e. unlocking a treasure chest, scaring away a worm, digging a hole in the ground, etc.), you gain access to new levels and new coding blocks. The coding blocks themselves are easy to identify and are placed in a given order by dragging and dropping. In my experience, the coding challenges are pitched at the right level to be challenging, but still doable, for young children.\n\nAs you make your way through the levels, be sure to keep the volume up on your device, since sometimes, in my experience, vital coding instructions are only provided by dialogue from the helpful purple beings. You can lower the volume during robot assembly (the music that plays at that time is just background music), but keep it turned up during the coding puzzles.\n\nIn some levels, you\u2019re asked to build additional items with leftover blocks that will help your robot to complete its next task. Strangely, you do have to build these extra items (such as a piano and a guitar for the monkey musician), since the app scans for them before moving on to the next challenge, but after being built, they are not required to keep the plot moving; the extra items are often rendered separately in the AR environment.\n\nAll in all, I had a blast making my way through the different levels in the Play module of the Botzees AR app. Those who are a fan of AR will love the absurd robot and environmental images that are superimposed on the boring flat surfaces in your home. One thing to note is that because the app uses your camera frequently, it can drain your battery faster than other coding apps might; keep your phone charger handy.\n\nThe three remaining modules, Build, Code, and Control, are basically the different sections that exist in the Play module; the Build module provides you with the robot assembly directions, the Code module gives you access to the coding environment (including the coding blocks you\u2019ve unlocked by solving the puzzles), and the Control module allows you to drive your robot using the forward/backward and left/right buttons. Parents will appreciate that there\u2019s an option to increase or decrease the intensity of each forward/backward and left/right button press, since lowering the intensity means that each motion happens at a much slower pace (and at a lower noise level).\n\nWhile there are only 30 levels currently available in the app, there are plans to roll out more levels in the future, although it\u2019s uncertain whether those additional levels will be free or whether they will only be accessible through a paid subscription service.\n\nThe bottom line: If your kid is interested in AR, building with blocks, or solving puzzles, look no further than the Botzees robot kit for hours of fun and subtle coding tutorials.\n\nBuy the Botzees kit for $100\n\n7. Kid-friendly figurines that turn your tablet into a coding game\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall Tangiplay is a coding kit wherein kids place specific figurines on a tablet to solve coding puzzles.\n\nAges: Ages 4+ years\n\nApp: Tangiplay app for Apple tablets (Android app coming soon)\n\nPower: N/A\n\nHardware: A tablet with a touchscreen is required to use Tangiplay\n\nParental involvement needed: Moderate when first learning to use Tangiplay and when new coding concepts are introduced, minimal otherwise\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, conditional statements, loops, functions, debugging\n\nHow it works: Tangiplay is a neat way for younger children to learn coding concepts and solve puzzles at the same time. By placing large kid-friendly blocks on the tablet screen in the right order, your little coder can help the explorer vehicle plot a safe path for the oncoming train.\n\nOur experience: If you want to get your kids thinking about logic and spatial puzzles at an early age, look no further than Tangiplay. One Tangiplay kit involves 12 figurines, made out of food-grade silicone, and a series of interchangeable emoji faceplates that can be slotted onto each toy\u2019s face.\n\nIn the Tangiplay app, kids have to use coding commands to help the explorer robot bridge the gap and complete the railroad tracks.\n\nOnce you download the companion Tangiplay app on your iPad, the fun begins. You\u2019re tasked with solving a series of puzzles wherein you help the explorer robot to fill in the gap between an incomplete set of railroad tracks without running out of power. To solve each puzzle, your kid must use the twelve figurines to successfully navigate a grid space that has obstacles, a passenger who must be picked up, and a train depot.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall The Tangiplay kit comes with twelve figurines (where each figurine represents a specific coding element) and a number of emoji faceplates.\n\nThese twelve figurines each have a very specific meaning, and act as individual pieces of code that allow you to solve the puzzle and help the explorer robot complete the railroad tracks. The figurines are: \u201cMove\u201d, \u201cLay track\u201d, \u201cCharge\u201d, \u201cUse tool\u201d, \u201cStart loop\u201d, \u201cEnd loop\u201d, \u201cDebug\u201d, \u201cCreate function\u201d, \u201cCall function\u201d, \u201cStart if statement\u201d, \u201cElse-if branch of if statement\u201d, and \u201cEnd if statement\u201d.\n\nSome Tangiplay figurines have multiple options that you can select by rotating or sliding the figurine on the tablet screen.\n\nDuring each puzzle, a coding panel appears on the left; to enter a command, your kid simply places a single figurine on the flat-lying tablet, and the contacts on the bottom of each figurine translate into a coding command that is entered into the coding panel. Even more clever is the fact that certain figurines, when you place them on the screen, present multiple options that you can select by sliding or rotating the figurines on the screen.\n\nIf your code is wrong, the explorer robot can crash into an obstacle.\n\nIf you input a correct coding sequence, the train flies along the track from the starting point to the finish line, and you advance to the next level. If you make an incorrect move, however, you either smash into an obstacle or end up stranded in the grid space. The level resets to your most recent successful move, and you can fix your mistake(s) by undoing the last move, editing the program in the coding panel, or using the \u201cDebug\u201d figurine to step through program line by line. This forces young coders to really pay attention to both the specific coding commands they\u2019re entering, as well as the order in which they\u2019re entered; both of these concepts are vital to understanding computer coding logic.\n\nFor more complicated bits of code, such as conditional statements (the purple blocks at the far left), the Tangiplay app builds in example blocks of code so that new coders can see how these coding elements help the explorer robot navigate around the grid.\n\nWhen it comes to introducing new coding concepts, such as loops, functions, and conditional statements, Tangiplay includes a sample bit of code that plays at the beginning of a few levels so that coders can see how the new commands should be implemented, and how they can help the explorer robot to navigate the grid space in different circumstances.\n\nI was lucky enough to be given access to a pre-production review unit; this proved a bit problematic for me as there was not a lot of information available on how to actually use Tangiplay. There are no instructions with the set of figurines or in the app (it just leads right into the map of individual levels). As of right now, the Kickstarter page has the most information about how to enter coding commands and make certain coding selections. Prior to giving Tangiplay to your kids, I suggest that you gain some familiarity with the figurines and the programming logic. Make sure you also understand that the \u201cMove\u201d figurine moves the explorer robot in a direction that is from the perspective of the coder (the robot moves to the left), rather than the point of view of the exploration robot (the robot moves forward).\n\nKid coders can call on a flamethrower to help the Tangiplay explorer robot melt huge ice cube obstacles.\n\nThe lack of information also made things a bit tricky in certain levels. When confronted with an ice cube, a switch, or a pond, I had to discover that the \u201cUse tool\u201d figurine would give me a flamethrower, the ability to flip a switch, or a freeze ray through trial and error, since the \u201cUse tool\u201d figurine only allows you to use a given tool in a level that contains that specific obstacle.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall Our testers enjoyed the heck out of Tangiplay, and picked up the coding logic quickly once everything had been explained by an adult.\n\nThese minor issues aside, our testers, who were aged 7 and 10, easily picked up the coding logic and blazed through multiple levels. There were a couple of instances where the figurines didn\u2019t register as the correct command, or where they didn\u2019t register with the app at all, but other than that, they had a blast. I also had a lot of fun solving the puzzles, using a flamethrower, and laughingly wondering why the passenger, whom you must pick up and deliver to the train depot in the course of each level, can't just walk the two grid squares to his destination.\n\nBecause most Tangiplay levels can be solved multiple ways, the Tangiplay app rates you on the elegance of your coding solution.\n\nWhile Tangiplay gives kids the options to use more sophisticated coding elements, such as functions or conditional statements, the puzzles can still be completed without implementing these coding elements; however, you do get a star rating on each level that varies with the elegance of your coding solution, so that will entice more competitive kids to solve the puzzles in multiple ways to achieve the three-star rating for each level. While Tangiplay is rated for kids ages four and up, children that young may only really appreciate the puzzle aspect of Tangiplay; only the older kids will really start to appreciate the fundamentals of coding logic.\n\nWith 120 puzzles already available in the app, and with Tangiplay\u2019s intention to add more puzzles as time goes on, Tangiplay will keep young children and young coders entertained for hours.\n\nThe bottom line: While younger kids may need some parental assistance to understand the coding logic, Tangiplay is a fun, engaging take on coding basics and spatial puzzle solving.\n\nParticipate in Tangiplay's Kickstarter campaign\n\n8. A toy that is an art project and a robot at the same time\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAges: 4-7 years old\n\nApp: N/A\n\nPower: 4 AA batteries\n\nParental involvement needed: Minimal, once the barcode process is established and the meanings of some of the logical expressions are explained\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, counting loops, conditional statements, wait for input\n\nHow it works: KIBO is a robot who operates on a combination of sensors and barcode inputs.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nTo make KIBO follow a sequence of actions, kids build a program by assembling a line of large, kid-friendly wooden blocks, each of which has a different barcode on it. Each block line must start with the \"Begin\" block, and finish with the \"End\" block, which tells KIBO's barcode reader to start and stop looking for additional barcode inputs, respectively.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThen, children flash KIBO's barcode reader over each block in the order they want the actions performed, and KIBO chirps every time a barcode is successfully read. After placing KIBO on the floor, press the \"Go\" button, and let the fun begin!\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall KIBO moves forward, waits for a clapping sound, then shakes and moves backwards.\n\nKIBO comes in four different \"kits\", which are designed for smaller/larger groups of kids and less/more complex sensors and actions. Basic movement blocks include \"forward\", \"backward\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\", \"shake\", and \"repeat\". The basic modules are a light sensor, a sound sensor, a distance sensor, and a lightbulb.

Our testers couldn't help but agree.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nIt takes only seconds to assemble KIBO, and it only gets easier and more fun from there. The ubiquity of barcodes means that most kids will probably already know how they work. KIBO's barcode reader is wide, though, so it may take a bit of practice and some help from parents before little ones can aim and record the motion they want without accidentally scanning another barcode nearby.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall KIBO uses a barcode reader to scan and store commands.\n\nThe bottom line: Whether they prefer drawing or playing with numbers, every kid can find something fun to do with KIBO.\n\nUpdate: The creators of KIBO have recently released a series of extension kits, including a marker set (for drawing with KIBO), a LEGO kit, a literacy kit, and a sound kit.\n\nBuy KIBO for $229-$499 (depending on the kit)\n\n9. A whole environment of fun coding games on your tablet\n\nAges: Ages 5-12\n\nApp: Only available on most iPads. (Other Osmo games are available on other devices, usually an iPhone or an Amazon Fire Tablet. Click here to check on your device's compatibility with Osmo.)\n\nPower: N/A\n\nRequired: Osmo iPad Base\n\nParental involvement needed: minimal once the iPad is installed in the base and each coding block\u2019s purpose is established\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, functions, loops\n\nHow it works: Using a clever mirror system, Osmo turns your iPad into an interface where kids play games that are so much fun that they don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re learning about programming.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nOur experience: I just loved the Osmo game and block system. Once you mount your iPad in the base, place the mirror over the iPad\u2019s camera, and put a piece of blank white paper in front of the base, you\u2019re ready to jump right into the expansive Osmo ecosystem.\n\nCertain Osmo games, such as Osmo Newton and Osmo Masterpiece do not require the purchase of additional coding blocks.\n\nIn Osmo Newton, anything you draw or insert into the view of the camera can be used as a deflector to bounce balls in certain directions to hit a target. In Osmo Masterpiece, you can project and scale an image onto the piece of paper that allows your kids to trace and draw any picture they like. Osmo Masterpiece was able to whip even my shaky drawing skills into shape enough to draw a delightful witch.\n\nI would recommend starting kids out with these block-less apps first; I found the whole experience with the camera/mirror very disorienting at first, and it took me a while to figure out how the whole thing worked. Once I figured it out, though, it was easy to see how ingenious it is, and how it would work when the coding blocks were involved.\n\nOsmo really shines with its coding-related games. These games require you to download additional apps and purchase the coding blocks related to a given app. While there is a large degree of overlap with coding blocks between different games/apps, certain blocks special to each game might prevent children from getting the full effect of the lessons in a specific app if they are missing.\n\nIn particular, I tried out Osmo Coding Awbie (app / blocks) and Osmo Coding Jam (app / blocks, both of which were amazingly fun and great at establishing the programming basics.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe coding blocks are both incredibly powerful and incredibly easy to use. Each block is made of kid-friendly, colorful plastic. Most of the blocks have a disk with an arrow embedded into it; you can easily rotate the arrow to point in any of the four cardinal directions. The blocks snap together magnetically, and have numerical add-ons that allow you to code in an action up to five times in a row, without needing five extra coding blocks. With these blocks, you can explore a world made of forests and caverns (in Osmo Coding Awbie), or make hilarious and catchy music (in Osmo Coding Jam).\n\nIn Osmo Coding Awbie, Awbie is an adorable creature who has to rebuild its home after a natural disaster. Awbie buys the materials to build itself a new home and a new life by collecting strawberries and pies (the primary currency of Awbie\u2019s homeland), opening treasure chests, and chasing bunnies.\n\nKids progress through Awbie\u2019s adventures in the wild by using the coding blocks to navigate Awbie through a gridded environment. The Osmo Coding Awbie app has very clear and easy-to-follow lessons about how the blocks work (including the arrow rotation on each block), and what the purpose of each block is.\n\nThere are four major types of blocks: they roughly translate into \u201cforward\u201d, \u201cjump\u201d, \u201cgrab\u201d, and \u201cloop\u201d. Blocks special to the Osmo Coding Awbie set include the \u201csparkle\u201d (which is like a special bonus round), and \u201calert\u201d. Lastly, the Osmo Coding Awbie requires a special block with a \u201cplay\u201d button that actually tells Awbie to start moving through the latest code block. If your child doesn\u2019t get the code quite right, the stakes are low; Awbie is simply sent back to its initial position, and your kid gets to try until he or she gets it right.\n\nCoding with Awbie was so much fun; I had a ton of fun discovering the characters that live in the forest with Awbie and collecting tons (and tons) of strawberries along the way. In addition to Awbie\u2019s usual adventures, there are bonus levels (where you collect pies made by bunnies) and Awbie\u2019s plot of land, where you can plant (and reap the future benefits of) strawberry plants and buy Awbie new things to help Awbie rebuild its home. Osmo Coding Awbie is great for coders who are just starting out and younger children; older kids with some programming experience may find it a bit too easy.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nOsmo Coding Jam is less adventure and more musical discovery. In this app, kids are tasked with building code to play certain musical cues in a particular order. Like Osmo Coding Awbie, Osmo Coding Jam takes the user through simple lessons that illustrate the purpose of each block. Some of the blocks in the Osmo Coding Jam, while identical to those in Osmo Coding Awbie, have different meanings.\n\nIn Osmo Coding Jam, each lesson or \u201cjam session\u201d starts out with a funny character (an astronaut, a mad scientist, a Neanderthal, etc.) in the center of the screen, surrounded by different aspects of their environments (a planet, a table of beakers, a fire pit, etc.), arranged in three concentric circles, each of which is divided into four parts; each quadrant of each circle corresponds to a specific sound bite.\n\nIn this way, the \u201cgrab\u201d, \u201cforward\u201d, and \u201cjump\u201d blocks in Osmo Coding Awbie are repurposed in the Osmo Coding Jam into \u201cinner circle\u201d, \u201cmiddle circle\u201d, and \u201couter circle\u201d, and the arrow directions on each of these three types of blocks indicate which quadrant of each circle is played. The Osmo Coding Jam blocks also include a \u201csilent\u201d block, a \u201cloop\u201d block, and a few different \u201cfunction\u201d blocks, which have a certain sequence built in.\n\nOsmo Coding Jam is divided into two sections:\n\n\u2022 \u201cLessons\u201d, where kids learn how each block functions by building specific songs with specific characters, and\n\n\u2022 \u201cStudio\u201d, where kids put what they\u2019ve learned to the test, and create their own music by building their own coding sequences with a variety of characters\n\nYou can only get so far in the Lessons (in which you garner hearts for completing a given lesson) before you have to spend time in the Studio to get more hearts in order to unlock more Lessons. As you get further in the Lessons, you unlock more characters, each of which has its own sound effects and tone.\n\nOsmo Coding Jam was a blast. Each new character always made me laugh (my favorites were the grim reaper and the chemist), and I was pleased by how well musical sequences that seemed random during the coding stage came together when combined with the sound bites from other characters. The music is surprisingly catchy! Our test family reported that spontaneous dance parties would break out when the kids starting playing their own music compilations.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nIn general, the Osmo coding blocks come in stackable storage containers that make it easy to take Osmo on the go. Admittedly, kids might not be able to play with Osmo in the back of the car; you really need a steady, flat surface covered with a piece of white printer paper (or a white board similar to the one that comes with the Osmo Monster Game) for kids to be able to play with Osmo away from home.\n\nOne thing that might take some getting used to is fact that between every lesson in Osmo Coding Jam or every set of moves in Osmo Coding Awbie, the white piece of paper has to be totally cleared of coding blocks; the view of the mirrored camera is about as wide as the piece of paper, so coding blocks that have been nudged aside, but are still on the piece of paper will still be read by the iPad. To avoid confusion, get into the habit of completely removing the coding blocks each time a coding block sequence is correctly deployed.\n\nParents will enjoy this bit of information: Osmo will replace any lost or damaged coding blocks for free, as long it\u2019s within the first 90 days after purchase. I personally found the blocks to be pretty durable, but I can imagine how easy it would be to lose the blocks if they\u2019re not kept in their storage boxes.\n\nAdditionally, the Osmo universe is huge; there really is something for everyone. While individual sets need to be purchased, the apps are free.\n\nThe bottom line: The Osmo coding games are an elegant add-on to your iPad. With the coding blocks, your kid will be having a blast (and also learning how to code) in no time.\n\nBuy the Osmo base for $40\n\nBuy Osmo Coding Awbie blocks for $50\n\nBuy Osmo Coding Jam blocks for $60\n\n10. A funny card game for those who like pirates (and potatoes)\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAges: Ages 6+\n\nApp: N/A\n\nPower: N/A\n\nParental involvement needed: Moderate, for initial setup and learning/applying game rules\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, conditional statements, logical operators\n\nHow it works: Players raise and deploy pirate potato armies against one another with strategically played attack cards such as \u201cRoast\u201d and \u201cFry\u201d. These attack cards are made much more devastating by playing them in conjunction with \u2018while\u2019 loops or cards with other logical operators. The last potato army still standing is the winner!\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nOur experience: Potato Pirates is a card game whose box hits the nail on the head with the phrase \u201cCoding with carbs\u201d. Between the adorable artwork on the cards, the funny commentary in the manual, and the soft fuzzballs meant to represent the pirate crewmates, this game is a lot of fun for people of all ages.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nWe really recommend that an adult or a coding-savvy teenager take the time to read and absorb the different card functions and game rules; there are enough moving parts to this card game that trying to pick it up on the fly will probably not work. Additionally, playing this game with only a few players can result in very short games (as some of the cards are especially devastating when the damage can\u2019t be spread around and it is, at times, not clear how someone would rebuild a crew after it\u2019s been attacked); short games mean that there is not really enough time for children to learn or appreciate the coding concepts. This game is best played with multiple kids who are in varying stages of understanding coding logic.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nOn a given turn, a player can prepare an attack (while a ship is \u201canchored\u201d), or attack neighboring ships in hopes of killing all the potatoes aboard and sinking the ship down to Davy Jones\u2019 locker. Attacks are prepared by combining damage cards, like \u201cRoast\u201d, \u201cFry\u201d, and \u201cMash\u201d, with control cards, such as \u201cFor 2 times\u201d and \u201cWhile a ship has more than 5 potatoes on board\u201d. When ships are attacked, each ship takes damage in the form of removing potato fuzzballs from their associated ships.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nWe found that kids generally had few problems with the simple control cards, but needed a lot of coaching and practice with the more complicated control cards, especially in attacks where more than one control card is played. In that case, attacks are calculated using loops inside loops, and both damage and player confusion can grow quickly.\n\nIn addition to control and damage cards, there are cards that players can use outside of their turn, which can offset some of the idle time waiting for kids to take their turns, but can also add to overall chaos. Other fun aspects, such as saluting a person who plays a \u201cPotato King\u201d card, help with keeping those with short attention spans focused on the pirate spud fun.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe potato fuzzballs come in a cloth sack that should prevent you from losing them, but don\u2019t be surprised if a few go missing, as throwing the fuzzballs at other players is doubtlessly a common outcome in the case if potato pirate crews are decimated.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe bottom line: Once your kids master this potato-themed card game, applying the same principles to computer coding will be a breeze.\n\nBuy Potato Pirates for $15\n\n11. A robot that will keep your kids chasing after it\n\nAges: Ages 6+\n\nApp: Dash Path (iOS/Android), Dash Wonder (iOS/Android), and Dash Blockly (iOS/Android)\n\nPower: charged via USB, connected via Bluetooth\n\nParental involvement needed: Minimal, once Dash is connected and coding basics are established\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, logical operators, functions, function calls, conditional statements, wait for input, variables, counting loops\n\nHow it works: Dash is a delightful robot who teaches kids coding skills in three different apps: Dash Path, Dash Wonder, and Dash Blockly. These three apps have varying levels of complexity so that Dash is a fun experience for kids at different ages and coding experience levels.\n\nDash Path is ideal for children who are a bit too young to venture into coding concepts. Kids can draw freestyle paths for Dash to follow in a variety of settings, from a farm, to a cityscape, to a plain grid. Our test family agreed that younger kids will really enjoy driving Dash around \u201clike a racecar\u201d. For more challenging paths, you can also add a number of animal, vehicle, and natural noises and motions for Dash to act out along the way.\n\nDash Wonder is a bit more advanced, and has users building coding programs visually, by adding coding components, and then drawing line connections between the components to illustrate the order of operations.\n\nDash Blockly is the most complex of the three apps; kids can build coding programs in a method similar to actual coding practices\u2014they can build programs by assembling different coding \u201cblocks\u201d with various themes (actions, sounds, functions, etc.).\n\nThe Dash robot itself can also be modified with a number of accessories, including a xylophone, \u201clearn to code\u201d cards, a catapult launcher, and a sketch kit. With the sketch kit, both markers and a large white-board-like sketch mat are required.\n\nOur experience: Dash is a robot whose adventures evolve in tandem with your kid\u2019s coding abilities, and provides him or her with plenty of laughs and fun along the way.\n\nEach of the three apps involves a set of really helpful tutorials to help get your kid up and running. We would recommend that an adult work through the first few lessons in each app, just so that the adult can get a feel for the logic behind Dash, and can help the little ones if they come up against a concept they can\u2019t grasp by themselves.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nDash\u2019s vast library of motions, behaviors, and sounds is sure to delight coders both old and young. Who could resist watching Dash flail about in a tornado, and then promptly stop and let out a very earnest cat meow?\n\nAs with all robots aimed at kids, one key aspect that may be difficult to convey is the concept of relative direction. This is especially true for Dash, who can look left, right, up, and down, turn left and right by varying degrees, and move in all directions. A combination of some or all of these motions and actions may leave children feeling confused when Dash doesn\u2019t exactly head in the direction they\u2019d expect, but that\u2019s part of the learning process.\n\nWe also had a lot of fun testing out the catapult and the sketch kit. With any of Dash\u2019s accessories, be very sure that the attachments, which just snap onto Dash\u2019s sides, are in the correct orientation indicated in the directions. Our test family had a bit of trouble getting the catapult attachment to sit exactly right, and experienced many failed ball launches as a result, but finally getting it right proved very satisfactory.\n\nThe sketch kit attachment (where you place a marker on Dash, and send Dash on its way on the sketch mat) is a bit more intuitive, but it took us a few tries to get the marker in correctly so that it was actually drawing along the sketch mat. As for the sketch mat, make sure that it\u2019s on a surface from which it is easy to remove dry-erase markers.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nOur test family loved that there were tons of different ways to play with Dash, with interesting and fun challenges for both younger and older children. In particular, playing \u201cMarco Polo\u201d with Dash, who was using the kids\u2019 own recorded voices to say the titular phrase, resulted in much giggling. In their experience, one of the best parts about Dash is that it is sturdy enough to withstand repeated bonking into walls and other obstacles on the floor.\n\nThe bottom line: By itself, Dash is a fun and engaging way to get kids interested in coding; with the range of accessories available, it\u2019s easy to see how Dash could encourage children to find other real-life applications for coding.\n\nBuy Wonder Workshop's Dash Robot for $150\n\n12. Four kits that combine circuitry and cardboard\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAges: Ages 6+\n\nApp: Neuron Makeblock app and Swift Playgrounds app; only available on Apple devices.\n\nPower: Smart Power block with USB charger, connected via Bluetooth\n\nParental involvement needed: Moderate. Parents or older children may be needed to help with robot assembly and to help kids understand coding basics.\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, logical operators, conditional statements, wait for input, functions\n\nHow it works: By combining circuity, coding, and cardboard, young coders will find that there really is something for everyone in the Makeblock Neuron Explorer kit.\n\nOur experience: The Makeblock kit walks kids through assembling and coding actions for four models\u2014a lightsaber, a ukelele, a car, and a piano. The projects span a range of difficulties, which can either gradually help your kid to gain more coding experience, or can be a good for siblings at different coding experience levels.\n\nFirstly, it is possible to use this kit in a screen-free environment; users can assemble the models, and then arrange the circuit components in a specific order to make the models light up, play sound effects, move around, and more.\n\nHowever, the kit really comes into its own once you open up the Neuron Makeblock app. After selecting which model you\u2019d like to build, the app walks you, step by step, through the assembly process. Our test family found that some of the assembly directions were not quite as clear as they'd hoped; while the kids could mostly build the models by themselves, adults had to step in and interpret the animations at a couple points during the assembly of the ukelele and the lightsaber so that the kids could finish building the models.\n\nI would recommend having adults on hand during the assembly process in general. While the directions can be a bit confusing at times, the models are also relatively intricate, and little fingers may not have the hand strength to pop in certain components, or get the cardboard to fold just the right way. Once they\u2019re assembled, though, the models do look very cool; the designs on the cardboard are very eye-catching.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nOne huge benefit of the cardboard model pieces is that they can be disassembled easily, and snapped back into their flat holders for easy storage and they can be rebuilt and unmade again and again. Just be sure that you don\u2019t try to force or pull the cardboard tabs too much, since that could cause the piece to bend or tear.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nOnce assembled, the coding aspect comes into play. The Makeblock kit includes a wide variety of circuitry components, including an LED panel and light strip (vital for the car and the lightsaber, respectively), two motor drivers, a ranging sensor, and light sensor, a temperature sensor, a knob, and more. The circuit components are large, colorful, durable, and snap together magnetically for easy assembly.\n\nThe app teaches burgeoning coders to make the most out of these circuitry components by walking users through individual lessons that demonstrate how each component works, how it relates to the coding units on the screen, and how to customize each coding unit to accomplish a goal.\n\nWhile the coding environment may be fairly intuitive for adults or for more advanced coders, before trying out the coding with younger kids and newer coders, I would recommend navigating to the Help section and reading the detailed instructions for the coding elements (under \u201cTutorial\u201d) and the circuitry components (\u201cThe Creative Lab Kit Instruction\u201d; these are the instructions that come with the kit).\n\nEach coding lesson is accompanied by a little video that is incredibly helpful, in that it shows users how the coding elements connect up to the model\u2019s actions and reactions. However, it is impossible to actually close out of the video once you\u2019re done with it, and it can block the screen, preventing you from seeing all of the different coding elements. While you can hit the zoom out button to see it all more easily, it is then more difficult to see the details of each coding element.\n\nAt times, the actual mechanics of assembling a chunk of code are discovered through trial and error; while I liked how I could add more blocks to a code by tapping on the relevant circuitry element on the screen, and how easily it would connect up to existing code elements, I never did figure out how to delete a coding element from the coding window, meaning that there were extraneous coding elements cluttering up and already cluttered screen.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThose issues aside, I had a lot of fun making the \u201cExplorer\u201d car move towards and away from my hand while making funny faces on the LED panel.\n\nThe customizability of each circuit component is very impressive; not only can you manually create your own pictures on the LED panel by turning individual lights on and off with a finger tap, but there is a veritable library of sound clips available, and you can create your own musical composition by selecting musical tones and notes.\n\nOutside of the lessons, in the \u201cCode\u201d area, you can create your own coding projects, in which you can explore how coding elements fit together, as well as discover new coding elements which are not in the coding lessons. For more explanation on what the new coding elements do, be sure to check out the Tutorial in the Help section.\n\nThe parents from the test family really loved the fact that the Makeblock Explorer Kit's box makes it easy to store every part of the kit. Since there are a lot of smaller parts that could be lost easily, it makes sense to have a neat place to store the circuit components and the cardboard models; the box's design will make it both fun and easy for your kids to pack up the Makeblock Kit when they're done for the day.\n\nTo try out more models and additional circuitry parts, be sure to check out the Makeblock Neuron Inventor Kit and the Makeblock Neuron Creative Lab Kit.\n\nThe bottom line: The Makeblock Neuron Explorer Kit is a fun, hands-on coding and circuitry kit that kids and parents alike will enjoy.\n\nBuy Makeblock Neuron Explorer Kit for $200\n\n13.

Where FurReal really shines, though, is the coding and programming modules in the companion app.\n\nIn the \"Code\" module, kids use icons to build a sequence of actions, expressions, and sounds for FurReal to follow. After sending the commands over Bluetooth, FurReal acts out that code.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nTo program in FurReal's responses to physical touches on the robot itself, children use the \"Program\" module to build and upload macros that dictate how FurReal's different body parts react to being pressed or moved.\n\nMacros can be programmed and then uploaded to FurReal. This macro involves FurReal's responses after its nose is pushed some number of times.\n\nKids can manually control FurReal's movement and reactions in the \"Control\" module.\n\nThe app also offers a few games for children to play without the robot, so the fun can continue on the road as well.\n\nOur experience: The range of activities offered in the app is a perfect fit for kids in the stated 6+ years old age range. One of our younger testers really enjoyed using the \"Drive\" module to move FurReal around and explore its environment in real time, while the older kid had more fun watching the FurReal respond to inputs from the \"Code\" module.\n\nThe layout of the \"Code\" module is very intuitive, making it easy to understand that the FurReal can move, make a noise, and change its expression at the same time, and that those motions and expressions can change from one step in the code to the next. It may not be immediately apparent what each coding block does, however, so some experimenting may be required before kids can get FurReal to do exactly what they want.\n\nThe \"Program\" module also presents a nice way to bridge the age gap between siblings: older kids can program the responses of the FurReal (i.e. the reaction after FurReal's nose is pressed five times in a row), and younger kids can try out the programming on the robot itself.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nAs with most robots that move around, FurReal is better used on a hard floor surface than on a table. Assembly and disassembly of the FurReal is pretty straightforward, and, in fact, FurReal actually responds when body parts are removed or reattached. We also really appreciated the patch of fur on FurReal's back; it encouraged touch and human interaction, rather than just remote programming.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nThe bottom line: FurReal is a beginning coder's best friend.\n\nBuy FurReal Maker Proto Max for $25\n\n14. A high tech robot that can live in the virtual world\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAges: 6+ years old\n\nApp: Augie (iOS/Android), connection over Wi-Fi\n\nPower: Internal battery and charger included\n\nParental involvement needed: Moderate, to initially use and understand the different modules of the Augie app; after that, minimal, once coding basics are established\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, logical operators, functions, function calls, conditional statements, wait for input, variables, counting loops\n\nHow it works: Augie is an app-controlled robot with AR (augmented reality) capabilities.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAugie's intense processing requires a more solid connection between the app and the device, so it uses Wi-Fi, rather than Bluetooth pairing.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThere are six modules in the Augie app:\n\n\"Free Play\" \u2014 the user manually controls Augie's motions and display\n\n\"Trailblazer\" \u2014 the user draws freeform paths for Augie to follow with his/her finger, and can add emojis and sounds\n\n\"Coding Classroom\" \u2014 a step-by-step guide for how to code the many varieties of Augie's motions, emojis, and sounds\n\nAn example of a lesson in \"Coding Classroom\".\n\n\"Coding Control Center\" \u2014 where kids can write code for Augie to act out, based on the lessons from \"Coding Classroom\"\n\n\"AR Adventures\" \u2014 game play with Augie involving AR and donuts\n\n\"AR Coding\" \u2014 a step-by-step guide for how to code the many varieties of Augie's motions, emojis, and sounds in AR\n\nOur experience: Augie is one of the more complicated robots we got to test, despite being aimed at children as young as 5-6 years old. The app is really amazing and a lot of fun, but it comes with no explanation, so it will take an adult some time to familiarize themselves with the layout of the app, the purpose of each module, and the Wi-Fi setup before the kids can dive in. Augie retains and makes the Wi-Fi network information visible, which is convenient for quick reconnection, but might be a security concern for some.\n\nOnce Augie is up and running (on a hard, solid floor surface), it's very cool. The \"Coding Classroom\" module is amazing; it quickly but thoroughly teaches new programmers the uses of Augie's different tricks, as well as conditional statements, variables, and other coding basics.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nAugie has a hilarious variety of expressions and sounds; hearing a chicken clucking, immediately followed by jaunty clarinet music, definitely made my day.\n\nThe coding units on the screen are neatly colored and categorized; however, it can be difficult at times to see if two coding instructions have actually \"clicked\" together, which can cause some confusion when Augie stops after only performing a portion of the code.\n\nBecause Augie has an AR component, the app uses a lot of battery power and memory; if you're using Augie on a smart phone, be sure you have enough room on your phone memory-wise, a strong Wi-Fi connection, and a charger plugged in if you're using Augie in AR.\n\nThe AR itself is a lot of fun. In \"AR Adventures\", players must ward off small robots with laser beams, which will doubtlessly amuse kids and adults alike. However, maneuvering Augie in AR takes some getting used to, and may require the help of an adult before children can use it on their own.\n\nThe bottom line: Augie's intuitive coding module will be a boon to young programmers, but parents or guardians will need to be on hand to get Augie up and running before kids can dive in.\n\nBuy Augie for $200\n\n15. A circuit board kit for those who like to build models\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAges: Ages 7+\n\nPower: 6 AA batteries, 1 9-Volt battery, or USB connection to a computer\n\nParental involvement needed: Moderate, for initial circuit and model building; minimal once circuit basics are established\n\nCoding concepts: Order of operations, wait for input\n\nHow it works: Using the different function modules, kids can construct simple circuits on a Lego sheet that do everything from lighting up when a button is pressed to power a lunar eclipse (via a servo/motor module that integrates a model). Simply follow the circuit assembly directions, build the matching models, and complete the exercises described in the manual.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nOur experience: While the mPie Microduino Kit is more focused on the circuit-building aspect of STEM, rather than computer coding, it really helps to illustrate the concept of the order of operations. The circuit simply will not work if the modules are assembled (via magnets, which connect with a very satisfying click noise) in the wrong order, a lesson that we found to be a bit too advanced for kids below the stated age range of 7 years old and above.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nThis kit is great for kids who have a more visual style of learning; the modules are large and colorful, and the models (everything from a flyswatter to an ambulance) really make the lessons tangible. If the ambulance's siren doesn't sound, then it's back to the circuit board. With mPie, burgeoning STEM enthusiasts can make mistakes and learn in a low-stakes environment that makes success (in one case, launching a catapult) taste all the sweeter.\n\nIt might be a good idea to have an adult on hand, at least at first; children who've never seen a circuit board before may take a while to cotton on to the idea (although they will doubtlessly recognize the Lego bump pattern of the board where the circuits are mounted). Little fingers also may not have the dexterity to assemble the physical models, which are attached to a small motor with elastic bands. Additionally, because the modules must be magnetically stuck to one another first, it can be difficult at times to mount the entire circuit on the LEGO board.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nIncluded with the kit is a book that guides you, step-by-step, through the circuit design and building process. The lessons, while not \"re-playable\", are mostly easy to follow and can usually be done in less time than stated on the project cards. Our kid tester had a little bit of trouble with the directions on the \"Fly Swatter\" model, but was otherwise thrilled as she flew through each lesson.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe lesson book, in addition to the directions, also assigns activities that encourage reflection and imagination, which is always a good thing where growing minds are concerned.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nThe bottom line: The mPie Microduino kit can help kids to translate commands and the concept of \"order of operations\" into models that they can interact with in real life.\n\nBuy the mPie Microduino Kit for $110\n\n16. A sassy, clever companion robot\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAges: 7+ years old\n\nApp: Cozmo (iOS/Android), connected via Wi-Fi\n\nPower: Internal battery and charger included\n\nParental involvement needed: Minimal, once coding basics are established\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, logical operators, functions, function calls, conditional statements, wait for input, variables, counting loops, macros\n\nHow it works: Cozmo is a little robot who intuitively reacts to objects and people alike.\n\nCozmo's intense processing requires a more solid connection between the app and the device, so it uses Wi-Fi, rather than Bluetooth pairing.\n\nCozmo comes with three light-up cubes that Cozmo can move and manipulate.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThere are four main components of the Cozmo app.\n\nIn \"Feed\", kids give Cozmo delicious treats in the form of the light-up cubes.\n\nFor \"Play\", users can ask Cozmo to do tricks or play games with it.\n\n\"Tune Up\" involves calibrating Cozmo's different sensors and basically performing routine \"maintenance\".\n\nThe \"Discover\" module includes \"Code Lab\", which is where kids can build their own code and watch Cozmo turn it into reality.\n\nWhen not in use, Cozmo chatters and chirps, and often wanders around looking for obstacles and people with whom to play.\n\nOur experience: Hanns Tappeiner, Co-founder and President of Anki, told me that famous robots like R2-D2 and Wall-E inspired Cozmo. Trying to replicate the emotional connection that people experience with robots in movies involved going above and beyond the bare minimum: \"A robot should be making eye contact with you, remember where he saw your face, and keep track of the world around it.\" To make Cozmo as clever and interactive as possible, Anki didn't just focus on the robotics aspect; Cozmo's personality/AI and facial animations have their own respective development teams. The result? \"Everyone treats Cozmo like a pet.\"\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nIndeed, that was the very first comment that the tester made to me about Cozmo. Cozmo is adorable and extremely responsive, and definitely acts like a curious, mercurial pet when it is not being actively directed from the app.\n\nCozmo's AI includes two neat features: facial recognition and spatial mapping. This means that Cozmo can register the difference between a frown and a smile on a kid's face. In fact, \"wait for a smile\" is a line that you can program into Cozmo's code.\n\nThe red arrow indicates the coding block for \"wait for smile\".\n\nAs for spatial mapping, Cozmo not only scans for (and registers) the presence of the light-up cubes, but looks for the human faces of its friends. The mapping isn't perfect (testers reported instances of Cozmo not recognizing every instance of cubes being tapped or shaken), but it makes for lots of fun when playing games. One such game involves Cozmo pouncing on any wiggling fingers it sees.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe included games and tricks are neat, but \"Code Lab\" is especially robust. After being walked through useful tutorials, users can do tons of cool stuff by combining a variety of icons representing different actions, emojis, noises, and logical operators. There isn't a lot of explanation for what each icon means, so it may take some trial and error for kids trying to get Cozmo to perform a specific sequence of actions, rather than those just exploring Cozmo's many different tricks and actions.\n\nAdditionally, in \"Code Lab\", the coding \"blocks\" (commands) are quite small, so they might be difficult to move or see for those with limited hand/eye coordination or imperfect eyesight, respectively.\n\nFor especially advanced coders, Anki will be releasing a \"Code Lab\" update that includes \"vertical grammar\", which allows kids to engage in multi-threading, or programming in different columns of code that will run simultaneously.\n\nCredit: Anki\n\nCozmo is correctly advertised as being for older kids; younger children have difficulty letting Cozmo figure out its environment for itself, and often want to lift Cozmo up to help it complete its task. Additionally, Cozmo is as appealing to adults as it is to kids because Anki has created Cozmo SDK, a community for coders of all ages to make complex programs for Cozmo in Python, a common programming language.\n\nWith the rapid processing required to make Cozmo interactive, it's no surprise that the Cozmo app uses a lot of battery power; for extended use, be sure to have a charging cable plugged into your device. Lastly, a phone or tablet connects directly to Cozmo's Wi-Fi network, so when playtime is over, users will have to switch back to their home Wi-Fi network manually.\n\nThe bottom line: Cozmo is a lovable, emotive robot who can be a coding companion for older kids for the rest of their lives.\n\nUpdate: Anki has just realized the Limited Edition version of Cozmo, as well as updated the Cozmo app interface, and really expanded Cozmo's capabilities. Create with Cozmo, a book that guides young programmers through the journey of coding with Cozmo, has also just been released.\n\nFurther update: In mid-2019, Anki went out of business. Cozmo appears to still be available for now, but customer support may be limited.\n\nBuy Cozmo for $180\n\n17. A LEGO kit every coder will want\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAges: Ages 7-12\n\nApp: LEGO BOOST (iOS/Android), connection via Bluetooth\n\nPower: 6 AAA batteries\n\nParental involvement needed: Moderate, for initial app navigation and setup; minimal once coding basics are established\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, conditional statements, logical operators, wait for input, variables\n\nHow it works: The LEGO BOOST kit comes with over 800 pieces, a stiff paper grid map, and a Bluetooth-connected motor that also includes motion, color, and orientation sensors.\n\nLEGO BOOST only works with certain smart devices (primarily tablets) and some computers. Click here to see if your device is compatible with LEGO BOOST.\n\nWith instructions from the companion app, you can build one of five mobile, interactive models (including a guitar, a cat, a robot, a bulldozer, and a mini factory). Obviously, as with any LEGO kit, there is also the option to build whatever your kid wants to create. Once one of the models (or your child\u2019s freestyle creation) is built, kids can write lines of code by dragging and dropping icons that click together and watch as the LEGO models react in fun and creative ways.\n\nOur experience: As with all things LEGO, the fun is just endless with the BOOST kit.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nWhile this LEGO kit can naturally be enjoyed on its own without the app, kids who want to get the models moving and reacting to their environment will want to use the sleekly-designed app. The lack of written instructions either in the kit or on the BOOST app can be a boon or a curse; kids will find it intuitive to navigate, while adults may want to dig around for some kind of written manual.\n\nIn the main menu, builders can select one of five models to create. Each model contains certain levels with step-by-step building instructions for assembling the model pieces; once kids get to a stopping point in building the LEGO model, the app then demonstrates the capabilities of that model with coding tutorials.\n\nUsers will need to do some experimentation with each coding block before its meaning becomes clear, but the tutorials are a good introduction to coding basics and the types of tricks each model has up its sleeve.\n\nAs you might expect, the models are awesome. I built the cat model in a few hours (admittedly, a large portion of that time was taken up in trying to find certain LEGOs), and it is truly amazing.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nGranted, it\u2019s been about decade since the last time my LEGO obsession reared its head, but clearly the block design and technology have evolved to new heights. With that block complexity in mind, have a pair of needle-nosed pliers on hand for easy model disassembly.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nIf your little ones are LEGO novices, think about starting them out on smaller, non-coding related LEGO kits, since those without the experience of reading LEGO assembly directions will be thrown by the lack of written instructions. Our testers, on the other hand, are all devoted LEGO lovers, had an absolute blast building the first car model. The six-year-old, even though he is outside the stated age range, easily picked up the drag-and-drop coding elements.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nOnce the LEGO builders in your life are more advanced in coding, they can try the freeform coding section of the LEGO BOOST app, where kids can make creations move and react to their heart\u2019s content.\n\nThe bottom line: The LEGO BOOST kit is perfect for the LEGO lover in your life who is just entering the world of computer programming.\n\nBuy the LEGO BOOST kit for $160\n\n18. A spherical robot that just keeps rollin'\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAges: 8+ years old\n\nApp: Sphero Edu (iOS/Android), pairing via Bluetooth\n\nPower: Internal battery and charger included\n\nParental involvement needed: Minimal, once the app is set up, navigation of the app is understood, and coding basics are established\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, loops, conditional statements, strings, logical operators, wait for input, variables, functions\n\nHow it works: Sphero SPRK+ is a spherical robot that rolls and reacts according to the code created in the Sphero Edu app.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nSPRK+ comes with a charging base, \"maze tape\", and a protractor. The maze tape acts as as a boundary that SPRK+ will detect and navigate along, but never go beyond. SPRK+'s various sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, and orientation) provide feedback to the app, and act as inputs for further commands.\n\nThe SPRK+ coding language is a solid match for real programming languages; comments or warnings can be set up if SPRK+ performs certain actions or experiences certain circumstances (i.e. freefall, an obstacle, etc.).\n\nOur experience: SPRK+ is the undecorated form of the widely-beloved BB8 robot from the new Star Wars Trilogy, and watching this little spherical robot roll and bounce is a great deal of fun.\n\nWe suggest, however, that parents take the time to get the app up and running themselves, as there are some initial sign in and connectivity steps that may cause kids to get bored. It also takes a little bit of time and experience for adults to figure out how navigate and use the app, and then show the kids how it's done.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nOnce SPRK+ was up and running, it was a blast. We found the coding language to be extremely detailed; on a block of code for motion, kids can control the direction (estimated with the protractor, from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 of a circle), speed (out of a possible speed of 255, for a tidbit of binary), and the duration of that movement (up to 999999 seconds). Users can code in blocks, draw paths with their fingers, or actually code SPRK+'s movements and actions in Javascript.\n\nCode for SPRK+ can be written in blocks, freeform by hand, or also in Javascript (not shown).\n\nFor a bit of fun, children can also add in light and sound effects. Watching a little robot roll towards me at high speed with a chainsaw noise playing out of my phone was slightly more intimidating than I thought it would be.\n\nSPRK+ coding components include lights, sounds, and movement.\n\nAs a bonus, because SPRK+ is basically a robot inside a water-tight compartment, there is even a lesson plan on the Sphero activity website (also found through the \"Sphero\" tab on the app) for teaching SPRK+ how to swim. We really appreciated SPRK+'s durability, as it is possible to have SPRK+ fall from smaller heights without breaking, or even without disrupting the code. That said, it's best to use SPRK+ on a hard floor surface with a lot of open space.\n\nSPRK+ is definitely for older kids, though, because one subtle point may make navigation more difficult for younger kids: the concept of relative direction. In the app, SPRK+ can be \"aimed\" with the indicator light is on its behind, and then the relative angles can be determined with the included protractor. However, the \"forward\" direction (or 0\u00b0) is less obvious because SPRK+ is perfectly spherical. With time and practice, though, it should become less of a problem point.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nThe bottom line: SPRK+ gets more fun and more complex as kids get better and better at computer programming.\n\nUpdate: Sphero just released the Sphero Mini Activity Kit, a kit similar to Sphero SPRK+, but geared more towards children as young as five years old.\n\nBuy SPRK+ for $130\n\n19.

Using both circuit-building skills and coding skills, you can make R2-D2 dance around or attack intruders, or you can create your own customized robot.\n\nOur experience: The Droid Inventor Kit helps you to unleash the Rebel fighter within you and your kids. The kit involves six circuit components that can be mounted in a variety of arrangements to a Lego-like structure to build droids that can move easily both on hardwood and carpeted floors.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nBy adding wheels and cranks to two of the circuit\u2019s servos, your kid will slowly start to see how circuit inputs and connections help R2 to navigate around. Once you add in the app experience, though, a whole other world of possibilities opens up.\n\nThe Droid Inventor Kit app is divided into two sections: \u201cDroid Controls\u201d and \u201cMissions\u201d.\n\nIn the \u201cDroid Controls\u201d module, you can play with the different circuitry components individually. Some controls include:\n\n\u201cSound Board\u201d, where kids can make their own recordings and explore R2\u2019s surprisingly sophisticated range of noises\n\n\u201cJoystick\u201d, where you can just drive the robot around freestyle\n\n\u201cSecurity Mode\u201d, where you can watch R2 freak out when something registers on its proximity sensor\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nIn the \u201cMissions\u201d module, where each mission involves easy-to-follow video instructions that you can pause and replay at any time, children first assemble a very basic circuit, mount it onto the circuit board (the circuit modules click together magnetically and are built such that they can snap into the board), and have a very naked version of R2 move around.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nThe next mission involves assembly of R2-D2\u2019s shell. Once users see how everything snaps together, it\u2019s off to the races with a series of lessons that introduce the coding basics in the context of R2\u2019s movements and reactions. One point of frustration in the missions is that while you can pause and replay videos, you cannot go back a step in the sequence\u2014you have to exit out and restart the mission again, which can prove time-consuming if you\u2019re building something elaborate and skipped a step by accident.\n\n(The coding itself is based off of Scratch Blocks, so those familiar with the Scratch logic will catch on quickly, but those new to coding will still find it easy to move coding elements around with their fingers.)\n\nNaturally, these missions get more complicated until kids really start to understand the real-life effects of code built on a screen and the endless possibilities that can arise from combining the same coding elements in different ways.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nOne of the best parts is getting to the part where you can make R2-D2\u2019s head spin around with a simple press of a button. It\u2019s satisfying to watch its head swivel around like it\u2019s looking for Stormtroopers to take down.\n\nThe last mission, \u201cCode Master\u201d, allows for access to all of the programs coding blocks, and lets your child program R2 to his or her heart\u2019s desire. I found the range of possible coding blocks to be somewhat limited compared to other comparable toys, but that\u2019s because users are encouraged to go to DIY.org and gain access to more coding blocks and share their programs with a worldwide community of coders (you may need to pay a subscription fee to access certain content). Additionally, circuit components and coding blocks are completely compatible across all of the different littleBits coding kits, including the Avengers Hero Inventor Kit and the Electronics Gizmos & Gadgets Kit.\n\nLast but not least, there\u2019s also an art component to the Droid Inventor Kit\u2014you can create and decorate your own robot shell. With the included stickers, it\u2019s easy to make R2 look like any robot you can think of. Additionally, there\u2019s even a place to mount a marker on R2\u2019s back end so that it can draw patterns on paper sheets on the floor.\n\nThe Droid Inventor Kit has a ton of Star Wars-themed touches, which will really draw in those who grew up wanting to wield a lightsaber.\n\nThe bottom line: The Droid Inventor Kit by littleBits is easy fun for both kids and adults. With step-by-step coding instructions for coding and circuit beginners, to freestyle coding for those who are more advanced, you and your family should be able to play with R2-D2 for years.\n\nBuy the littleBits Droid Inventor Kit for $100\n\n20.

Programs coded in the Maker account are uploaded to the Mover Kit (and the Mover Kit is charged) with a USB cable. The Javascript that corresponds to the block code is also visible on the same page as the project.\n\nBlock code and the corresponding Javascript code for a Mover Kit program.\n\nProgramming for the Creative Coder Kit is driven by the two types of data: the device's orientation and its movement (or lack of movement). Three primary \"gestures\" are recognized by the Creative Coder Kit: \"Pow\", \"Whirl\", and \"Shake\".\n\nSensor input drives the programs in the Mover Kit.\n\nOur experience: The Creative Coder Kit is the perfect marriage of computer programming and non-screen play time. For the coding aspect, kids compose their programs on the computer by dragging and dropping the different coding elements into the project area. Each program is mostly driven by the sensor data of the Creative Coder Kit; the information from the sensors (like which way the device is facing and the aforementioned gestures) is the input, and the light show from the LEDs embedded in the Creative Coder Kit is the output.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nAs the name of the Creative Coder Kit implies, the sensors are activated by movement. Kids will enjoy seeing the ultimate fulfillment of their coding skills once the lights activate according to the uploaded programs. The Maker part of the Technology Will Save Us website has tons of neat sample projects, including shadow puppets and Gandalf's staff.\n\nThis is toy is correctly targeted at older kids who are just learning to code, as more advanced programmers may want more complex feedback than blinking colorful lights. That the coding is done on a website, rather than in an app, means that the programming aspect may not be as accessible to younger children.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Sunil Doshi\n\nKids and parents alike will both really appreciate the creative aspect of the Creative Coder Kit; the device doesn't necessarily have to be worn on the wrist, but can be mounted anywhere with its velcro strap, not the least of which is inside a lightsaber (i.e. paper towel tubes).\n\nThe bottom line: The Creative Coder Kit is the perfect intersection of creative and programming fun for older coders who are just starting out.\n\nBuy the Creative Coder Kit for $60\n\n21.

Unless your kid has tried some of the beginner JIMU Robot kits (e.g. Builderbot kit, Explorer kit, Tankbot kit, etc.), chances are that (s)he will need help with the robot\u2019s assembly.\n\nI chose to build Muttbot, and it took me 2-3 hours to fully assemble. The assembly directions (in the \u201cBuild\u201d section of the app) are very thorough and involve little animations that really help to show exactly which pieces go where. In anticipation of long assembly times, the app actually allows you to bookmark or scroll to a given set of directions, a function that I really appreciated. That said, if you take a break during assembly, it may be difficult to get 8 or 9-year-olds to come back to finish the robot. If your kid doesn't have that kind of attention span, consider the aforementioned smaller, easier JIMU Robot kits.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Erin Fife\n\nI would really recommend that an adult or older kid help with building the first JIMU robot; there are a number of very small pieces, as well as pieces that are only subtly distinct from one another. These two factors combine to make the task of building the robot a bit more difficult than those robotics kits aimed at younger, less experienced builders. On the other hand, to help with those smaller pieces, this kit cleverly includes a \u201cfastener removal tool\u201d, which really helps to speed up disassembly.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nAdditionally, connecting the servos (small motors that provide rotation) to the internal battery requires hand-eye coordination and hand strength that may surpass the abilities of younger children.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\n(On a similar note, I didn\u2019t realize until a significant part of the way through assembly that the pieces actually snap together securely [even though it\u2019s mentioned in the directions], so to prevent pieces of Muttbot falling off while the robot is in motion, push all pieces together until you hear a \u201csnap\u201d to ensure that everything is properly attached.)\n\nOnce the robot is built, though, your kid is in for a wild ride. In the JIMU app, there are three options for exploring Muttbot\u2019s capabilities:\n\n\u2022\u201cControl\u201d, which allows you to drive aspects of the robot manually\n\n\u2022\u201cActions\u201d, where you can try out the robot\u2019s build-in actions\n\n\u2022\u201cCoding\u201d, where you can control the robot via coding with virtual blocks that \u201csnap\u201d together to form full command chains and functions\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nWhen I told Muttbot to \u201cplay\u201d (in the \u201cActions\u201d module), I was instantly surprised by how much movement was actually involved. Muttbot pranced like a champion breed at a dog show, and then jumped and stretched with the grace of a cat (albeit a robotic one).\n\nI felt like the proverbial kid in a candy store when I was in the \u201cCoding\u201d section; there were tons of options for variables, control statements, actions, and sensors (sensors are not included in this kit, but in expansion packs). However, there are no coding tutorials available in the app, so unless your kid already has a solid understanding of coding logic, you may need to sit down and explain the purpose of each piece of code. Alternatively, start your child off with some of the more basic robotics/coding kits mentioned earlier in this article.\n\nThe \u201cControl\u201d section is for those who want to build and customize their own robots with the pieces in the kit. In this module, you can explore and hone your understanding of each aspect of the servos and other built-in actions, to the point where you can tell a specific servo to rotate a certain number of degrees in a certain time frame. In that same vein, for those looking for ideas about other fun models you can build with the Buzzbot & Muttbot kit, you can see other users\u2019 projects (and add your own!) in the \u201cCommunity\u201d module in the JIMU app.\n\nThe bottom line: The JIMU Robot Buzzbot & Muttbot Kit has a steep learning curve, but it will really help the more advanced coders to flourish and inspire them to imagine and create robots beyond the basic models.\n\nBuy the JIMU Robot Buzzbot & Muttbot kit for $70\n\n22. Three board games that the whole family can play\n\nAges: 8+ years old\n\nApp: N/A\n\nPower: N/A\n\nParental involvement needed: Moderate, to understand the gameplay, minimal once gameplay and rules are established\n\nCoding concepts: Following commands, order of operations, conditional statements, logical operators, functions\n\nHow it works: On the Brink, Robot Repair, and Rover Control all come with a small game board, game pieces, a mission book, and a solution manual. Each \"level\" is its own individual mind teaser, where only a specific combination of colors or moves is the correct solution.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nIn \"Rover Control\", kids must color in certain branches of a map, arrange charging stations, and account for different possible colored paths (i.e. conditional statements) to ensure that the rover hits certain checkpoints and ultimately reaches the stated endpoint for that level.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\n\"Robot Repair\" involves fixing a broken robot by turning on and off certain color switches so that the logical statements in the mission book for that level are satisfied.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nFor \"On the Brink\", players must set up functions (made up of robot movements) corresponding to each colored space on the game board, such that the rover safely makes it to the end of the maze (without surpassing the aforementioned brink).\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / ", "description": "From Hasbro's Think & Learn Code-a-Pillar to Anki's Cozmo to the LEGO BOOST kit, theses games and robots are teaching kids the basics of computer programming.", "authors": ["Updated October"], "top_image": "https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--abaXWZPK--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_auto,w_1200/https://reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/1510767276000/cubetto5.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-13"}
