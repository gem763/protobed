He\u2019s free to embrace what he believes is his true gender identity and take steps to become a woman.\n\nA child is a different story. No matter how mature a child may seem, he is neither mentally nor emotionally capable of making such a life-altering decision. So, in the case of 7-year-old James Younger, his mother is making it for him:\n\nThis is barbaric. A court has determined that a deranged lunatic mother can now force her 7 year old son to be a girl, and the father has to go along with it. Absolute madness. https://t.co/RYWdpCeZTw \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) October 21, 2019\n\nMore from LifeSite News:\n\nA jury has ruled against Jeffrey Younger, the father who is trying to protect his seven-year-old son, James, from chemical castration via a gender \u201ctransition.\u201d This means James\u2019 mother, Dr. Anne Georgulas, will be able to continue \u201ctransitioning\u201d him into \u201cLuna,\u201d and now has full authority to start him on puberty blockers and eventually cross-sex hormones. The jury\u2019s decision likely means that Mr. Younger will be required to \u201caffirm\u201d James as a girl, despite his religious and moral objections, and will also be forced to take a class on transgenderism. \u2026 Last week, the arguments revolved around James\u2019 diagnosis of gender \u201cdysphoria,\u201d medical records recommending he begin the process of preparing for puberty blockers, and expert testimony about the risks and alleged benefits of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. Mr. Younger is worried about Dr. Georgulas forcing a lifetime of misery on their son. Transgender-identifying individuals, even when encouraged in their confusion, suffer from more psychological issues than the general population, have shorter lifespans, and are more likely to commit suicide.\n\nOh and icing on the cake: the demented lunatic of a \"mother\" isn't actually the mother. The child was conceived with donor eggs. She's not even biologically related to the kid. \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) October 22, 2019\n\nThis poor child\u2019s so-called mother is not acting in the best interests of her son. She\u2019s doing this for no one but herself. She appears to be on a one-woman wokeness crusade and to hell with her son\u2019s welfare. This story is absolutely horrifying.\n\nI can't get over this case in Texas. A mother decided that her 7 year old boy is really a girl because he liked the movie Frozen. The husband insisted that he's a boy. Courts got involved. Jury just ruled that, yes, the boy is a girl and he will now be \"transitioned\" into one. \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) October 22, 2019\n\nI don't think people realize just how monumental this case is. We've just crossed a threshold as a society. There's no going back. These are very dark times. Most of all for that poor boy, whose mother is a despicable monster. \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) October 22, 2019\n\ncc @tedcruz, @GregAbbott_TX Is there anything you guys can do for this boy? He's going to be permanently mutilated and physically destroyed if someone doesn't step in \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) October 22, 2019\n\nListened to an interview with the father. He says the mother used to lock the boy in his room and tell him there's a monster who only eats little boys. At three, she started dressing him like a girl. Would withhold affection if he wasn't dressed like a girl. \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) October 22, 2019\n\nThis woman is pure evil. Here's the interview. It's astounding. https://t.co/xRN0wA7W0g \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) October 22, 2019\n\nNo words.\n\nSickening \u2014 TurtlePower98 (@sstaedtler98) October 21, 2019\n\nThis is sick!!! \u2014 Michael Dyson Scheepers (@Dysongrills) October 21, 2019\n\nUnconscionable \u2014 Stephen Mason (@Steveohmygoodne) October 22, 2019\n\nThis is appalling. My heart goes out to him and his poor son. Best of luck, James. \u2014 UniqueLaura (@UniqueLaura25) October 22, 2019\n\nThis torments me. The child stated to the experts that when with his mom, he wanted to be a girl; when with dad, to be a boy. He just wants them both to love him.\n\nA 7yr old, being altered FOR LIFE, for the mistake of expressing himself\u2026beyond sick. \u2014 Christine Biediger (@bied15) October 22, 2019\n\nA 7-year-old boy will be \"transitioned\" into a girl with hormone blockers and sex change hormones after his mother decided he was a girl bc he liked Frozen. The father took the case to court and lost. This poor boy is literally going to be destroyed. Don't stop retweeting this. \u2014 Evan Kilgore (@EvanAKilgore) October 22, 2019\n\nSomething has got to be done to save this poor boy.", "description": "", "authors": ["Sarah D", "Posted At Am On October", "Sarah D."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shame-on-you-resized.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
