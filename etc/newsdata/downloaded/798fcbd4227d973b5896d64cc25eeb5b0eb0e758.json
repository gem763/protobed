In an interview with ABC News\u2019 Senior Foreign Correspondent Ian Pannell, Hasik offered a rare and chilling insight into the mind of an ISIS operative.\n\nOffering no remorse for his actions, Hasik said that he believed an attack on mainland Europe was forthcoming, and dismissed the significance of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\n\"When one dies another pops up,\" he warned.\n\n(MORE: Turkey announces new deal with Russia as US says its Syria ceasefire has succeeded)\n\nHasik was born in 1994 near Srebrenica, Bosnia, where he said he lost 20 family members during the devastating civil war in the 1990s. From the 1992 campaign of ethnic cleansing in eastern Bosnia to the three-year siege of Sarajevo, this was the theatre of some of the worst violence in mainland Europe since World War II.\n\nHe was imprisoned there as a child with his mother and escaped to Germany at the age of 6 as a refugee. After spending a few years in the United States, he returned to Germany, where he began abusing drugs and was imprisoned for a petty crime at 19. He became aware of ISIS at the age of 21, and joined the group with friends he met in jail, arriving in Syria in August 2014.\n\nSix months after joining, he returned to Germany but fearing another spell in jail went back to Syria.\n\n\u201cThe process [of joining] was easy,\u201d Hasik told ABC News.\n\nIn the same month he joined, ISIS captured the town of Sinjar during their surge through much of northern Iraq and Syria. There, they began a comprehensive attack on the Yazidis, slaughtering many and capturing women and girls as sex slaves.\n\nWhen asked to answer for ISIS\u2019 innumerable atrocities and crimes, Hasik, who now wants to return to Germany, proclaims his innocence.\n\n\u201cI was just a policeman,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just caught people doing drugs and things like that. I was just doing a job. This war is dirty. And I'm fed up with war. I want to live a normal life with my family and kids.\u201d\n\nThe prisoner, who is married and has two children in Germany, said he is \u201cfinished with Islamic State.\u201d\n\nPHOTO: Hasic also warned that ISIS may launch an attack in Europe, as a response to al-Baghdadi's death. (Jamie Baker/ABC News) More\n\nDoes he expect to be released?\n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I didn't break no law in my eyes.\u201d\n\nYet Hasik, who was stationed in the former ISIS strongholds of Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa during the two years he spent with the extremist group, showed no remorse for their crimes in the Middle East or the attacks they inspired in the U.S., Sri Lanka and around the world.\n\nAsked several times how he felt about ISIS victims -- some of whom Pannell named, including Kayla Mueller -- the Bosnian national was both frightening and unflinching.\n\n(MORE: Family of slain ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller says they secretly met with her captors in Iraq)\n\n\u201cI didn't write their destiny,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is their destiny.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Hasik surrendered to American forces. He is now in the highest-level security prison in northern Iraq, which is estimated to hold thousands of terror suspects.\n\nBut with more than a hundred ISIS prisoners reportedly on the loose having escaped from Syrian jails, the group is down, but not out. Security analysts are concerned they have become emboldened since Turkish forces launched a military incursion into Kurdish-held territory earlier this month.\n\nPHOTO: 'I was just a policeman,' Hasic said, when confronted with the group's crimes.
