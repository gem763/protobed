The product is among the brand\u2019s \u201cDinner Party\u201d range.\n\nThe name prosecco has been protected since being granted DOC (denomination of controlled origin) status in 2009 and can be used only if authorised by the region\u2019s consortium of prosecco producers.\n\n\u201cIdentity theft must not be allowed,\u201d said Bellanova. \u201cThe seizure testifies to the strong commitment of the ministry and the ICQRF, our authority which fights against food fraud and for the protection of quality, to fight against the usurpation of Italian protected names.\u201d\n\nLuca Zaia, the Veneto president who often wages war against anything that could harm the image of the region\u2019s famous sparkling wine, shared a photograph of the offending can of Pringles on Facebook, superimposed with the message: \u201cNO!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can no longer tolerate the use of a protected name without authorisation,\u201d Zaia wrote.\n\n\u201cJust think,\u201d he continued. \u201cYesterday hundreds of cans of prosecco crisps, made up of ingredients including an unspecified \u2018prosecco powder\u2019, were seized from a chain of supermarkets in Veneto, purchased from a Dutch company \u2026 this is why we have been insisting for years that we need to protect our excellences from fraud, abuse and anything \u2018Italian-sounding\u2019, as it primarily damages honest producers who promote quality and the territory.\u201d\n\nProsecco and pink peppercorn Pringles were first launched last autumn as limited-edition Christmas snacks, selling in the UK, where the drink is wildly popular, in Asda and Tesco.\n\nThe investigation in Italy, which was carried out by the ICQRF unit in the prosecco-producing area of Conegliano, led to the seizure of 250 tubes. \u201cBut the investigation does not stop,\u201d said Stefano Vaccari, the unit\u2019s chief. \u201cWe could eventually find thousands of boxes as other withdrawals are under way and the company has also undertaken to withdraw the product.\u201d\n\nPringles said in a statement: \u201cThe prosecco and pink peppercorn variant was produced in 2018 as a limited edition for the Christmas holiday period. We used prosecco DOC as an ingredient in the aroma and the use of the name of the product on the packaging was designed in line with DOC guidelines and European regulations. We have no plans to produce this variant in the future.\u201d", "description": "250 tubes of wine-flavoured crisps taken in investigation into use of protected name", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5531c2a3e77150c6d87b6e3b62b6d6b8ca26247/0_10_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=873a5dc23833a52d47c3d2084516a5ac", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
