Worley grew out of the engineering consultancy Wholohan Grill and Partners established by Grill in the 1970s and Grill was Worley's CEO for more than three decades before becoming chairman in 2013. He retains a 6.6 per cent stake in the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn unusually outspoken comments, Grill told Worley's annual general meeting on Monday that customers had \"expressed concern\" about Dar's increased influence and that Worley saw \"minimal synergy\" in forming a global business cooperation agreement with the Middle Eastern group.\n\nBut Grill and the rest of the board made a strategic error when they approved cash bonuses paid to chief executive Andrew Wood and chief financial officer Tom Honan immediately after completing Worley's $4.6 billion acquisition of the Jacobs Engineering Group's energy, resources and chemicals business in April.\n\nThe takeover has not been good for Worley's share price, which has lost about a third of its value since the Jacobs deal was announced a year ago, and investors were furious that Wood received $480,000 and Honan was paid $200,000 simply for completing the deal.\n\nAlmost 31 per cent of votes cast were against Worley's remuneration report at the AGM.\n\nA vote of 25 per cent or more against a remuneration report is considered a \"strike.\" If the same company receives a second strike two years in a row - which Dar could easily force - shareholders can vote to spill the board.\n\nWith Australian laws allowing Dar to \"creep\" up Worley's register by buying 3 per cent every six months, Dar could hold more than 25 per cent of the engineering group by next year's AGM.\n\nWorley has told FIRB that typically less than 60 per cent of shareholders vote at AGMs, and that further increases in Dar's holdings will allow it to pass ordinary resolutions (which require approval from at least 50 per cent of votes cast), enabling it to control the election of directors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exact motivations behind Dar's pursuit of Worley are unclear. The Middle Eastern group's origins date back to 1956 when four professors, including Kamal Shair, from the American University of Beirut formed an engineering firm, Dar Al-Handasah.\n\nThe firm shifted to a partnership model in 1970, changing its name to Dar Al-Handasah Shair and Partners, and expanded internationally through acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nDar is now run by Kamal Shair's son Talal Shair, a engineer and graduate of the US's Princeton and Cornell universities.\n\nDar's consolidated financial statements are not available to the public. Its parent, Dar Al-Handasah Consultants (Shair & Partners) Holdings Limited, is registered as a private company in Dubai's special economic zone, the Dubai International Financial Centre, which offers zero tax rates on corporate income for up to 50 years.\n\nIt has an intermediate holding company registered in Jersey in the Channel Islands, which does not impose corporate taxes for most companies and is considered a tax haven.\n\nSome of its engineering subsidiaries, including the UK's Penspen Group which reported a \u00a314.4 million ($27.2 million) loss in 2018, are struggling.\n\nPenspen is a relatively small business, employing just 792 people compared with the 19,038 employed by the whole Dar group at end of 2018 but includes Talal Shair among its five directors.\n\nPenspen's financial accounts show it increased \"inter company borrowings\" in recent years and that it had deferred repaying some \u00a3600,000 due in June on a \u00a39 million secured bank loan that was secured by Dar to December.\n\nPenspen's immediate parent is Dar Al-Handasah Consultants (Shair & Partners) UK Limited, which made an annual profit of \u00a3550,684 in 2018 on revenues of \u00a312.8 million generated by fees for services provided to other Dar companies.\n\nDar Al-Handasah Consultants was forced to pay an additional \u00a3108,386 in income tax for the years 2012-2018 to HM Revenue and Customs following a review of its books.", "description": "A first strike against Worley's remuneration report has raised the stakes in the engineering group's fight to keep an unwelcome suitor away.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4322%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_599%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a354a196b3f8fa9aba09b00a0ef2d26cdcc04203", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
