Stephen A. Smith said the Tennessee Titans could be an ideal destination for Brady because of his closeness with their head coach Mike Vrabel, a former Patriots linebacker.\n\nThere were reports that Brady might be interested in joining the Los Angeles Chargers next season. But for Cassel, he believes that Brady won\u2019t be playing for another team in his career. \u201cIt's probably going to be with the Patriots or nobody,\u201d said Cassel, who started 15 games for the Patriots in 2008 after Brady went down with a torn ACL in Week 1.\n\nCassel says Brady won\u2019t join rebuilding squad\n\nCassel is convinced that Brady won\u2019t put himself in a position playing for a rebuilding team where he\u2019s not comfortable with the offense and everything else.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL New England Patriots\n\nFor Cassel, the only thing that could convince Brady to play for another team if it will be coached by current Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. \u201cHe'd possibly go do that, but that is so far removed from what I think could possibly happen,\u201d said Cassel. Earlier, Brady expressed dismay over rumors and speculations about his future with the Patriots. In an interview with Jim Gray on Westwood One Radio, Brady said he would try to stick with his initial plan to play until he\u2019s 45 years old.\n\nPatriots sign new kicker\n\nThe Patriots did not make any trade before Tuesday\u2019s deadline, but they made a change in their kicker position. The Patriots cut Mike Nugent following his two missed field goals in their 27-13 win over the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. In four games with the Patriots, Nugent went 5-of-8 on field goals and 15-of-16 on extra points. The Patriots then signed Nick Folk as their new kicker, according to Ian Rapoport of NFL Media.\n\nA Pro Bowler in his rookie year in 2007, the 34-year-old Folk last kicked in the NFL in 2017. During his career, he suited up for the Dallas Cowboys, New York Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.", "description": "It's probably going to be with the Patriots or nobody, Cassel said of Brady's future.", "authors": ["Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Boxing Champ Manny Pacquiao Calls Tom Brady 'Goat'", "Tb Still Plans To Play Until He S", "Patriots Trade Target O.J.
