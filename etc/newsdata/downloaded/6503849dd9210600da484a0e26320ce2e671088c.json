Some people see this line of work as a bit of a niche, but I believe being an SCM specialist will lead to a good career, which is why I\u2019m here at PolyU.\u201d\n\nWith the global economy driven by international trade, the fast and reliable transport of goods is essential to keep everything moving as required.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where SCM comes in and why it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d Lau says. \u201cIt makes sure the flow of goods and services is well managed and tightly controlled. For me, a future in the sector looks both promising and exciting.\u201d\n\nAs someone who believes in stepping out of one\u2019s comfort zone, she has taken every chance to spend time overseas.\n\nKatrina Lau visited the Saxon Switzerland National Park in Dresden, Germany, during a five-month student exchange programme.

It was a little reckless, but also character building.\u201d\n\nLau also went on a nine-day study tour to Melbourne in her second year. She had to make all the arrangements for the trip herself, from booking flights to reserving rooms and planning the itinerary. Her SCM studies helped her along the way.\n\n\u201cThe most intimidating part was making contact with Australian logistics companies to set up meetings,\u201d she says. \u201cI still remember getting tongue-tied during the first phone call when they asked me to explain the purpose of the visit. Looking back, I\u2019m not sure if it was the Australian accent or my rusty English which caused the problem, but my heart was definitely pounding.\u201d\n\nKatrina Lau and her friends pose at the Puffing Billy, a theme park in Melbourne.

In comparison, I have to admit that Hong Kong rehousing management still leaves a lot to be desired.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Lau urges fellow students to step outside their own circles and see the world.\n\n\u201cIt is worth your while to go into uncharted territory once in a while and explore. You get to know yourself better and become a stronger person.\u201d\n\nEdited by John Cremer\n\nYou might also like:\n\nLearn how to get everything to the right place at the right time with PolyU\u2019s undergraduate course in supply chain management\n\nHere\u2019s why studying aviation at PolyU opens up a world of opportunities\n\nLearn about why logistics are the lifeblood of a city with PolyU\u2019s undergraduate degree in Transport Logistics", "description": "Sponsored Feature", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/8_hitchhiking_trip_with_bike_3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
