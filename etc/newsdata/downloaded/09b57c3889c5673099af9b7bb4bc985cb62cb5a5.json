(Image: DC Universe)\n\nTitans\u2019 cast of superheroes and villains has gotten so large that the series has largely shifted away from dedicating entire episodes to single characters, but this week\u2019s straightforwardly named \u201cConner\u201d focused on nothing but the latest live-action incarnation of Superman and Lex Luthor\u2019s genetically-engineered offspring.\n\nSuperboy\u2019s got two dads, and Titans is very insistent about you understanding that keenly. Unlike the way it was obvious \u201cAqualad\u201d was going to promptly dispose of its Atlantean character as soon as he was introduced to the series, \u201cConner\u201d immediately gives you the impression that Titans has plans for Superboy, which maybe explains the episode\u2019s crash-course of a story.\n\n\u201cConner\u201d bridges the gap between Titans\u2019 first and second seasons by following the moments when Conner first freed Krypto and escaped from the Cadmus Labs. While the officially recruited Titans were busy dealing with Rachel\u2019s father and the reemergence of Deathstroke, Conner was still being born, in a sense.\n\nThough physically mature, Conner awakes in the lab terrified and knowing nothing about the world beyond the fact that his instincts tell him he\u2019s in danger. After Conner breaks his way out of his incubation pod, we see him kill a number of Cadmus employees, and it at first seems like \u201cConner\u201d might be leaning into Titans\u2019 signature grim-darkness. But the episode quickly takes on a more complicated and at times lighthearted tone that feels like something the series hasn\u2019t really led with before.\n\nMoments after murdering the people who were experimenting on him, a naked Conner makes friends with Krypto, decides to name himself Conner, and runs off with the super-powered dog in a silly disguise to hide somewhere in the world, despite the fact that he doesn\u2019t really know... much of anything.\n\nFor all of Conner\u2019s power, he knows nothing about subtlety, meaning that it isn\u2019t long before Cadmus scientist Dr. Eve Watson (Genevieve Angelson) and Lex Luthor\u2019s right hand woman Mercy Graves (Natalie Gumede) are at the lab formulating a plan as to how to retrieve their missing \u201casset.\u201d To Mercy, Conner\u2019s merely another piece of Luthor\u2019s valuable property that needs to be returned to its rightful owner, while Eve\u2019s feelings are a bit more conflicted.\n\nPart of her is just as eager to get Conner back in the lab in order to study his unique genetic structure \u2014 the results of years of engineering work that she and her team put in at Cadmus. But Eve also feels some degree of sympathy for Conner, or at the very least she understands that if Mercy and Lex were to get their hands on the boy, their grand plans for him would be nothing but villainous.\n\nConner\u2019s none the wiser about the danger he and Krypto are in, though, for a number of different reasons \u2014 first among them being the fact that functionally, he has the mind of a child (albeit one who\u2019s growing rapidly more intelligent as he experiences more of downtown Metropolis). While Conner doesn\u2019t have any memories of his own, it\u2019s explained that the boy carries epigenetic memories, memories from the two people who contributed the genetic material that made him and which are now stored in his DNA.\n\nWhen presented with the opportunity to save a woman from a mugging, Conner springs into action like an excited kid, but he dispatches the criminal with a cold brutality that\u2019s at odds with the brighter side of his burgeoning personality. When he first sets eyes on Superman\u2019s logo on a vendor\u2019s t-shirt, he\u2019s immediately drawn to the symbol and he knows that it means something, but he isn\u2019t sure what.\n\nConner being drawn to Superman\u2019s symbol. (Image: DC Universe)\n\nBecause following his instincts has served him well, Conner decides to keep doing so, immediately gravitating toward the image of a picturesque wheat field plastered on the side of a truck. Conner might not know who he is, but he knows that his \u201chome\u201d is somewhere out in the countryside where the sky\u2019s big and blue, so he improbably hitches a ride that just so happens to drop him off in nearby Kansas.\n\n\u201cConner\u201d often feels like a long-lost pilot for a Superboy series in a way that other characters\u2019 feature episodes haven\u2019t. This is partially because the episode crams so much of Superboy\u2019s backstory into such a short amount of time, but the episode always feels brisk and expertly truncated rather than rushed.\n\nWhen Conner arrives in Kansas, the episode attempts to fake the audience out by implying that he\u2019s about to set foot on the Kent\u2019s farm and meet Superman\u2019s family, but of course, it\u2019s the Luthor property where he arrives and meets Lex\u2019s elderly father Lionel (Peter MacNeill). It\u2019s in Conner\u2019s interactions with the people and things closest to his genetic forebears where \u201cConner\u201d shifts into an interesting psychological space.\n\nThough Conner doesn\u2019t know Lionel personally, he has emotionally powerful, but muddled, recollections of the kind of fear Lex felt as a child when being beaten by his father. Conner doesn\u2019t grasp what his flashbacks mean when he begins to have them in the Luthor house, but as he sits and speaks with Lionel, the boy gradually realises that he has some sort of connection both to the house and to the man he\u2019s just met.\n\nWhen Conner presses Lionel about the way he treated his son, Lionel concedes that he was rough on the boy, but it came from a desire to instil a kind of humanity in him that he felt his son was fundamentally lacking. Through Lionel, \u201cConner\u201d introduces the idea of Lex Luthor having potentially been a brilliant sociopath as a child, something that Conner can\u2019t wrap his mind around; on some level, he understands that Lionel\u2019s implicitly talking about him, though neither can be fully sure of that.\n\nBut just as things are coming to a head on the Luthor property, Eve and the Cadmus soldiers arrive prepared to capture the super boy \u2014 and when Conner realises that he and Lionel are both in danger, whatever darkness is in him recedes to give over to his heroic instinct to protect people who are in danger.\n\nTitans\u2019 special effects have never been much to write home about, but \u201cConner\u201d illustrates how television productions have all basically gotten the Superman power-set down to a tee at this point, and it is rather nifty seeing Conner outrun bullets in small spaces (not to mention Krypto zapping people with his laser vision).\n\nOf course, Conner has no problem taking out the soldiers, but when he comes upon Eve, he hesitates as she begins to explain her involvement in his creation and the genuine regret she feels about Cadmus\u2019 entire operation.\n\nSuperboy and Krypto taking on some mercenaries. (Image: DC Universe)\n\nEve\u2019s relatively quick change of heart about Cadmus makes \u201cConner\u201d feel a bit like a piece of very personal fanfic that the author inserted themselves into in order to hammer home a few points before giving the character a heroic, melodramatic sendoff that forever changes Conner. Eve knows that even though Conner has the capacity to do terrible things, he also has Superman\u2019s warmth and greatness.\n\nConner has both Lex Luthor and Superman\u2019s knowledge in his mind, but he lacks any of the context for it, meaning that it\u2019s up to him to decide how he\u2019s going to apply it all. Eve is not Conner\u2019s mother, but she becomes a maternal presence in his life for the short time they\u2019re together before she realises that if she wants to ensure that Conner never becomes like Lex, he has to understand what kind of man Luthor is.\n\nCommon sense would say not to bring the anger-prone manchild clone to the place where his creators killed many people and where multiple early, failed clone experiments sit in abandoned tanks, but this is a comic book show.\n\nEve wants to atone for the sins she committed in the name of science, and it almost seems as if she knows that Conner\u2019s going to snap and try to kill her when he sees the other attempts at creating a hybrid being like himself. But the part of him that comes from Smallville and wears an S on his chest (that isn\u2019t an S, yes, yes, whatever) wins out, and Conner realises despite her previous actions, Eve does truly care for him and want him to be safe.\n\nConner wants to bring Eve with him and escape to freedom, but they both know that would never end up working, and so the boy and his dog escape and...somehow end up wandering into just the right place and the right time to witness Jason Todd\u2019s impending fall from the previous episode.\n\nThe way \u201cConner\u201d suddenly weaves Conner\u2019s story in with the rest of the Titans is jarring and messes with the episode\u2019s pacing in a way that makes it difficult to exactly follow how Conner gets from point A to B so quickly. That being said, having Conner scoop Jason out of the air to narrowly avoid Titans having to do \u201cA Death in the Family\u201d is slick, and hints at what kind of new energy the half-Kryptonian\u2019s going to bring to the team.\n\nThat is, unless that Kryptonite bullet he gets shot with actually manages to kill him, which which case, Conner might end up leaving Titans just as soon as things were getting interesting.", "description": "Titans\u2019 cast of superheroes and villains has gotten so large that the series has largely shifted away from dedicating entire episodes to single characters, but this week\u2019s straightforwardly named \u201cConner\u201d focused on nothing but the latest live-action incarnation of Superman and Lex Luthor\u2019s...", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "James Whitbrook"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/rzrryxe2slw4pvisubgc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
