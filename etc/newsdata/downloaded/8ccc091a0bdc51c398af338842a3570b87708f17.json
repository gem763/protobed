We\u2019re learning who is better than we thought, who is worse, and then there are the teams just on a hot (or cold) streak. Here are the rankings after a week of the NBA season, but expect big shifts the first few weeks.\n\n\n\n1. 76ers (3-0, Last week No. 3). Size and defense are winning out for Philadelphia early on. Their size wore down Boston on opening night, and the combination of Josh Richardson and impressive rookie Matisse Thybulle ground down and smothered Trae Young. Questions about where the shooting will come from on this team still exist \u2014 they take an average number of threes but are hitting just 32 percent so far \u2014 but a defense allowing less than a point per game is getting them wins.\n\nSixers small icon\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\n\n2. Clippers (2-1, LW 7). Kawhi Leonard is dishing the ball like never before \u2014 he is averaging 7.5 assists per game, when he had never been above 3.5 per game before. Or, look at it this way: He is assisting on (an estimated) 47.6% of teammates buckets when he is on the floor, when he has never been above 19% in any previous season. The Clippers have impressed to start the season with an insanely efficient offense, but their defense has not been good (25th in the league on Cleaning The Glass, which eliminates garbage time). If that doesn\u2019t improve it will catch up with them.\n\nClippers small icon\n\nStory continues\n\n\n\n3. Bucks (2-1, LW 1). Giannis Antetokounmpo fouling out of his first two games was a surprise, but the Greek Freak is still putting up monster numbers \u2014 24.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 9 assists per game \u2014 and he\u2019s still making game-saving plays like against Miami. The Bucks defense has been pedestrian so far this young season, but expect that to turn around.\n\nBucks small icon\n\nGiannis tips it in to force OT!!#FearTheDeer pic.twitter.com/8n5cyX2fgY \u2014 Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) October 26, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Timberwolves (3-0, LW 18). Karl-Anthony Towns is locked in, seems to have taken another leap forward this season, and has put up monster numbers \u2014 32 points, 13.3 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 blocks per game so far. He\u2019s been incredibly efficient and much more active on defense. Andrew Wiggins has looked much better\u2026 in the fourth quarter. Only. He\u2019s shooting 33 percent in the first half, but has averaged 7.7 points per game on 57.1% shooting (inlacing 57% from three) in the fourth quarter. The NBA doesn\u2019t really have a closer out of the bullpen role, but Wiggins is trying.\n\n\n\n5. Jazz (3-1, LW 4). Their offense has been clunky this season, not always getting open looks and guys missing open shots when they do come. Only one game has seen Utah score more than a point per possession (Sacramento) but thanks to an elite defense keeping opponents at below a point per possession also they are 3-1. Internally, they expect the offense to turn around as guys just get more familiar and comfortable with each other. Mike Conley isn\u2019t going to shoot 20% overall and 15% from three all season.\n\nJazz small icon\n\n\n\n6. Lakers (3-1, LW 6). So far this season Anthony Davis has spent three quarters (74% officially) of his time at the power forward spot and one quarter (26%) of the time at center. AD at the five worked well against Utah, which drops Rudy Gobert back in the paint and the Lakers needed to draw him out. Wherever he plays he\u2019s putting up numbers, including a historic 40 points and 20 rebounds in just three quarters against Memphis.", "description": "Minnesota has rocketed up to fourth on the strength of Karl-Anthony Towns start.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hjJvTXJ.lz5hjlsKo5b.tA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjAuOTc5NTkxODM2NzM0Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3z3lWaeIzuxlzrfyOV4ryA--~B/aD01NTI7dz05ODA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/f8a6780a118882a4683e2fb1850b6bc9", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
