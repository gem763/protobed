It's a halo car for the brand.\n\nText size\n\nOn Sept. 6, Porsche announced it had increased its stake in Rimac Automobili, the Croatia-based electric supercar company, to 15.5%, up from 10% ownership announced in the spring of 2018. It was more proof, if any was needed, that for automakers the road to high-speed battery motoring often goes through the unlikely location of Zagreb, Croatia\u2019s capital.\n\nRimac is an automaker as well as a supplier to leading companies such as Hyundai/Kia, Jaguar, Koenigsegg (for the Regera), Aston Martin (the Valkyrie), W Motors (the Lykan Hypersport), and Siemens. The electric Jaguar E-Type used by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for the royal wedding in 2018? Rimac was under the hood. Mike Goodbun of Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations said back then that the car was \u201cengineered in conjunction with Rimac Automobili in Croatia, for some of the electrical expertise.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting here is that automakers, usually vertically integrated and somewhat resistant to collaboration because they want to protect trade secrets, are opening up to partnerships in the age of electricity. Batteries and electric motors have not been in the wheelhouse of mainstream carmakers, at least in the modern era.\n\nPorsche is deepening its relationship with Rimac in the wake of the worldwide debut of its Taycan electric car. The Taycan will offer blistering performance (2.6-second zero-to-60-miles\u2013per-hour times in the Turbo S), but there\u2019s growing evidence that Porsche, mindful of the EV competition, is looking for something even faster.\n\nA spokesman for Porsche tells Penta, \u201cPorsche initiated a development partnership with Rimac Automobili against the backdrop of the Porsche electrical offensive. By developing its purely electric two-seater super sports cars, like the \u2018ConceptOne\u2019 or \u2018C Two,' as well as core vehicle systems, Rimac has impressively demonstrated its credentials in the field of electromobility.\u201d\n\nMate Rimac, just 31 years old, founded Rimac in 2009. He started racing a BMW 323i he converted to electricity while still a teenager. Porsche photo\n\n\u201cRimac\u2019s ideas and approaches are extremely promising,\u201d the spokesman adds. (Porsche does not identify its spokespeople.)\n\nThe Australian website Motoring quoted Dr. Stefan Weckbach, head of EV Projects at Porsche, at the just-concluded Frankfurt Motor Show, \u201cOur target is always, no matter what car we\u2019re doing, to have the sportiest car in the segment\u2026 So there\u2019s different ideas and discussions ongoing and there will definitely be a next Porsche hypercar in the market.\u201d He declined to give a date or specify what technology package would reside within.\n\nBut Rimac is sure to be part of Porsche\u2019s development team for that new car. According to Mate Rimac, founder of the company, in a Porsche statement when the bigger stake was announced, \u201cWe have many collaborative ideas that we aim to bring to life in the future.\u201d Rimac, which is expanding rapidly, now employs 550 people.\n\nRimac\u2019s cars are its mobile calling cards, though they\u2019re highly exclusive and made in tiny numbers. The new model is the C_Two, first shown at the Geneva show in 2018. The promised performance of the C_Two is out of this world, with a zero-to-60-miles-per-hour time of just 1.85 seconds and a top speed of 258 miles per hour. The car is said to produce 2,300 newton meters of torque (1,696 foot pounds). \u201cThat\u2019s around three times more than a \u2018conventional\u2019 Italian supercar,\u201d Rimac said in a release. Why wouldn\u2019t Porsche want to tap into that tech, if it performs as stated?\n\nThe C_Two will be limited to 150 examples (large by its standards), and they were sold out within weeks of the model being announced. The average buyer specified US$615,000 worth of options, so the cars (to be delivered starting next year) are really being sold for approximately US$2.7 million.\n\nThe C_Two uses four liquid-cooled electric motors, one at each wheel, and a huge 120-kilowatt-hour lithium-nickel battery that reportedly delivers 402 miles of range. With a high-voltage connection, recharging to 80% capacity is said to take less than 30 minutes. Observers might be inclined to dismiss some of Rimac\u2019s more extravagant claims, were it not for the Croatian company\u2019s close cooperation with the world\u2019s most prestigious automakers.", "description": "The Croatia-based company\u2019s own blistering battery supercars are its calling cards", "authors": ["Jim Motavalli"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110835/social", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
