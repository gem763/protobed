The appeals court could hear oral arguments as early as the week of Oct. 21, and depending on the outcome, either side may try to take it up to the Supreme Court.\n\nAD\n\nHere are the decision\u2019s key takeaways:\n\n1. A sitting president is not immune from criminal investigation.\n\nMichael Cohen, the president\u2019s former personal attorney, pleaded guilty to two federal crimes last year that arose from an arrangement to pay off adult-film star Stormy Daniels in 2016 and silence stories of an extramarital affair with Trump. The hush money \u2014 which constituted a campaign-finance violation \u2014 directly implicated the president and his businesses in a slew of illegal activity, including tax fraud and public disclosure crimes.\n\nAD\n\nNow, Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance is investigating whether any state laws were violated, too.\n\nTrump is fighting a grand jury subpoena from the district attorney\u2019s office ordering Mazars USA, his accounting firm, to turn over a bundle of documents dating to 2011 that involved the president, his businesses and many third parties.\n\nAD\n\nHis lawsuit filed against Vance is the most recent suit in which he\u2019s argued a broad claim of presidential immunity and suggested that a sitting president cannot be criminally investigated, ever.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Victor Marrero rejected that argument.\n\nIn a 75-page ruling, Marrero called Trump\u2019s request for a \u201cvirtually limitless\u201d shield from criminal process \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values.\u201d\n\nNo one, he reminded Trump, is above the law.\n\nAD\n\n2. Under certain circumstances, a sitting president may be indicted.\n\nAlthough nothing in the Constitution precludes the indictment of a sitting president, there is long-standing Justice Department guidance against it. This stems from three decades-old memos written by White House lawyers that presume a criminal prosecution would interfere with a president\u2019s exercising his executive duties.\n\nAD\n\nCiting these conclusions, Trump sought to expand his presidential power. It seems, however, he may have done the opposite.\n\nMarrero wrote that Trump\u2019s reliance on the memos was \u201cmisplaced,\u201d and questioned any guidelines crafted not by assessing an actual case with real facts but from remote hypotheticals and \u201chyperbolic horrors.\u201d\n\nMoreover, state criminal law enforcement isn\u2019t subject to Justice Department policy or tradition \u2014 meaning local prosecutors, such as Vance, are not bound by the memos when making charging decisions.\n\nAD\n\n3. If the appeals court rules for the district attorney, Trump may still successfully shield himself, others and his tax returns.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has been fending off investigations seeking his financial records and tax returns.\n\nAD\n\nIn two unrelated cases, Trump is battling to block Congress from getting the same documents. If Vance prevails, they would be shown to only the grand jurors, who are required by law to keep the evidence presented secret.\n\nThe president\u2019s attorneys have said they will appeal up to the Supreme Court, which could last until Trump is out of office. Any supposed \u201cimmunity\u201d a president has from indictment while in office expires when his time is over. For Trump, that could be on Jan. 20, 2021, assuming the statute of limitations \u2014 the deadline by which prosecutors must bring criminal charges \u2014 has not yet expired.\n\nAD\n\nBut the district attorney\u2019s office said it\u2019s running out of time to bring a criminal case.\n\nAD\n\nAllowing even a short stay \u201cmeans they win and we lose,\u201d Carey Dunne, the general counsel for the Manhattan district attorney, argued to Marrero. The grand jury\u2019s work would be \u201cirreparably impeded by additional delay.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A judge dismissed Trump\u2019s lawsuit seeking to block state prosecutors from obtaining his tax returns.
