(Lynne Sladky/AP)\n\nWe are officially a quarter of the way through the fantasy football season.\n\nPerhaps your season is going well; perhaps it isn\u2019t. Either way, I\u2019m here to provide assistance to keep the good times rolling or help you right the ship in Week 5.\n\nWe\u2019ve combed the far reaches of the Internet and culled only the choicest fantasy tips and advice. Below you\u2019ll find easily digestible nuggets addressing some of the critical situations fantasy owners will face from week to week.\n\nDig in. And dominate.\n\nBye weeks: Lions, Dolphins.\n\n[Week 5 fantasy football rankings]\n\nSleepers\n\nGeronimo Allison, WR, Packers: With teammate Davante Adams banged up and possibly out in Week 5 (see below), Allison and Marquez Valdez-Scantling would be in line to see an uptick in targets, as would tight end Jimmy Graham. Allison had a nice first half in a Week 4 loss, tallying 52 yards receiving and a touchdown. He failed to add to those numbers in the second half, but let\u2019s remember that Adams had a huge night. If he\u2019s out, Aaron Rodgers isn\u2019t going to stop throwing the ball. Allison was coming into his own during the 2018 season before suffering a season-ending injury, and now may find himself in position to be fantasy relevant again. Allison is owned in 34 percent of ESPN leagues.\n\nAuden Tate, WR, Bengals: If there was a lone bright spot in Cincinnati\u2019s poor showing on Monday night, it was Tate, who finished with four receptions for 50 yards. The Bengals are not expecting A.J. Green back for at least a couple more weeks; John Ross III was playing well in his place but was injured on Monday night. That leaves Tate in position to pick up some major playing time. Combined with a home matchup against an Arizona Cardinals secondary that\u2019s been vulnerable, Tate looks downright appealing for owners in need of an WR2/flex play. Tate is available in 97 percent of ESPN leagues.\n\n[Fantasy football start/sit Week 5: Trust Julian Edelman against the Redskins]\n\nFringe Starters\n\nStefon Diggs, WR, Vikings: It took three-plus games for Diggs to show some solid production, but that will go a long way toward easing the trepidation his owners have felt the last couple weeks, when the Minnesota passing attack left a lot to be desired. The good news is that there are several upcoming games on the Vikings\u2019 schedule that give reason for further optimism. Diggs and Co. will face the New York Giants in Week 5, with games against the Eagles, Redskins and Chiefs to follow. Start him with confidence.\n\nAustin Ekeler / Melvin Gordon, RBs, Chargers: Los Angeles welcomes back Gordon after a contract holdout. The Chargers host the Denver Broncos, who just gave up 225 yards rushing to Jacksonville\u2019s Leonard Fournette. This is the rare situation where both RBs are capable of delivering solid production. Gordon will get his first touches of the season. Ekeler will continue to get some carries and be utilized as a receiver, and as he showed last year, Ekeler can contribute even when Gordon is active. Both players should be productive in Week 5.\n\n49ers WRs: Much like the aforementioned situation in Minnesota, the passing attack of San Francisco also has been a little bit of a letdown. Marquise Goodwin, Deebo Samuel and Dante Pettis have all made their presence felt at points, but since training camp, most pundits have expected Pettis to emerge as the go-to wideout for the 49ers. The second-year receiver had been dealing with an injury, but with a bye week, he stands to make good on all that hype. San Francisco will host Cleveland, an appealing matchup. Is it enough to warrant putting Pettis or the others in your lineup? Chances are owners have better receiving options. At best, Pettis is a flex play, though he could have a lot of value going forward.\n\n[Week 5 waiver wire options]\n\nInjury Decisions\n\nDavante Adams, WR, Packers: Adams did not practice Friday and has been ruled out for Green Bay\u2019s Week 5 meeting with the Dallas Cowboys. He is nursing a toe turf injury he suffered in the Packers\u2019 Week 4 loss to the Eagles. It\u2019s a big blow to Adams owners, who will need to find an alternative.\n\nJosh Allen, QB, Bills: The Buffalo QB is listed as questionable but was a full participant in practice Friday. Allen is in concussion protocol, but it looks promising.\n\nSam Darnold, QB, Jets: New York welcomed Darnold back to practice Wednesday, but he will not play in Week 5, so downgrade wideouts Robby Anderson and Jamison Crowder. Anderson still merits flex consideration against a Philadelphia secondary that\u2019s been generous against the pass.\n\nDeSean Jackson, WR, Eagles: Philadelphia will again be without the speedy wideout in Week 5, and his absence should continue to provide owners of Alshon Jeffery and Nelson Agholor with added targets.\n\nChristian Kirk, WR, Cardinals: The Arizona wideout is likely out for Week 5 with an ankle injury. It\u2019s unfortunate since his matchup against the Bengals provided some appeal. Kirk has been targeted 36 times by the Cardinals through four games.\n\nDevin Singletary, RB, Bills: The rookie tailback has a hamstring injury and was limited in practice all week. He\u2019s listed as questionable. His owners probably want to relegate him to the bench given his status and matchup with the Titans.\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster, WR, Steelers: A toe injury has Smith-Schuster listed as questionable. It sounds like he will play, but temper your expectations.\n\nJamaal Williams, RB, Packers: Williams exited early in Week 4 with a concussion and will sit out this weekend. The impact of his injury suggests a bigger workload for fellow back Aaron Jones.\n\nRead more:\n\nWith Kirk Cousins struggling, the QB carousel of 2018 continues to sputter\n\nRaiders\u2019 Vontaze Burfict banned for the rest of the season for helmet-to-helmet hit\n\nRams\u2019 Todd Gurley hates Thursday night games, calls them \u2018the dumbest thing ever\u2019\n\nDerek Carr defends Vontaze Burfict, \u2018one of the most misunderstood people in the NFL\u2019\n\nVernon Davis is in the concussion protocol, adding to Redskins\u2019 injury woes\n\nThe Redskins would be a lot of fun if they were as good as Bill Belichick says they are\n\nRanking the NFL\u2019s biggest surprises through the first quarter of the season", "description": "", "authors": ["John Romero", "Multiplatform Editor", "Fantasy Football Reporter", "October At Pm", "John Arrived At The Washington Post In With A Diverse Skill Set That Continues To Grow.
