He has also been intimately involved in the inquiry into the death of the accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBut Mr. Barr is also closely overseeing a review of the intelligence community\u2019s decision to start a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign during the 2016 election, which is being led by John Durham, the United States attorney in Connecticut. As part of that review, Mr. Durham is exploring what role, if any, a number of countries including Ukraine played in the investigation of the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cWhile the attorney general has yet to contact Ukraine in connection with this investigation, certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating,\u201d Ms. Kupec said.\n\nIn the case of the Ukraine call, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel determined early this month that the whistle-blower complaint should not be shared with Congress\u2019s intelligence committees because it did not flag intelligence-related activities. Rather, it should be referred to the Justice Department as a possible violation of campaign finance law.\n\nMr. Barr was not involved in the Justice Department\u2019s review, which was overseen by the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen. It was led by the department\u2019s criminal division and conducted by career prosecutors from the division\u2019s public integrity section and the national security division.\n\nLast week, the criminal division concluded that there were no legal grounds for a criminal investigation in to Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior.", "description": "The Justice Department took four weeks to dismiss the significance of a phone call that has, in days, created a furor that could consume the Trump presidency.", "authors": ["Katie Benner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/us/politics/25dc-justice1/25dc-justice1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
