The transaction came back to haunt Thomas Cook this year when it wrote down the firm's value by \u00a31.1billion, and finally collapsed with around \u00a31.7billion in debts.\n\nAccountants scoop \u00a311m in just 3 weeks Accountants KPMG and consultants Alix Partners have emerged as big winners from the collapse of Thomas Cook \u2013 raking in \u00a311million in fees in just over three weeks. They have been appointed by the Insolvency Service's Official Receiver to liquidate the travel company by selling assets to recoup money for investors, banks and taxpayers. Insolvency Service chief executive Dean Beale told Parliament's business committee that in just over three weeks the two firms have received around \u00a311million. Committee chair Rachel Reeves said this 'sounds a lot to me'. But Beale said it reflected the 'huge undertaking' when Thomas Cook collapsed on September 23, including the liquidation of 23 companies. He said initially 300 employees had to deal with staff and cash at the 555 shops. It came as Elizabeth Barrett, director of enforcement at the Financial Reporting Council, said that the watchdog is looking at whether Thomas Cook's auditors EY raised 'sufficient challenges to management's estimates and assumptions' in the 2018 accounts.\n\nFontenla's attitude angered committee chairman Rachel Reeves, who said a 'little bit more humility and introspection about what went on wouldn't go amiss'.\n\nAnd his successor, Harriet Green, 57, who took the helm in July 2012 and was ousted just over two years later, laid into Fontenla's old-fashioned business model which relied on selling holidays on the High Street as more people booked holidays online.\n\n'The responsibilities I had were categorised in 2012 by three profit warnings, a huge wall of debt and a business model that was entirely out of sync with the industry and that's what I fought for 28 months, for 22 hours a day, to change,' she said. 'My responsibility is I failed to complete that.'\n\nShops sold for \u00a311,000 each The married couple who founded Hays Travel paid just \u00a36million for Thomas Cook's high street branches \u2013 less than \u00a311,000 per shop. John and Irene Hays were hailed as saviours when they snapped up 555 branches, saving thousands of jobs. Yesterday MPs were stunned when the chief executive of the Government's Insolvency Service said Hays bought the leaseholds for 'just over \u00a36million'. Dean Beale said the Official Receiver felt it was a 'good deal for creditors'. But sceptical Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger pointed out that '\u00a36million is not a lot of money' for 555 shops.\n\nBut Labour MP Reeves snapped when Thomas Cook's former finance chief Bill Scott blamed the 2018 heatwave for the sudden deterioration in its finances, which included the \u00a31.1billion write-down.\n\nThe firm's executives, aided by its auditors PwC and EY, have been accused of covering up the precarious finances for years.\n\nScott, ousted last October after less than a year in the job, said the slump in fortunes was caused by a 'once-in-a-generation' heatwave.\n\nThis, he said, triggered a 'sudden and sharp decline in profitability' as Brits stayed at home.\n\nReeves pointed out that other tour operators had not gone bust. 'The problem is that everyone we've seen from Thomas Cook has blamed everybody apart from themselves,' she said.\n\n'They never look at themselves and the decisions they've made and reflect on those \u2013 so it's the volcanic ash, it's the hot weather in the UK, it's the depreciation of sterling, it's the debt acquired by somebody else.'\n\nShe added: 'It would be good to hear someone say 'I wish we had made different decisions' rather than just passing the buck.'", "description": "Spanish-born businessmen Manny Fontenla-Novoa, 65, who was at the helm between 2003 and 2011, has been criticised for saddling Thomas Cook with a mountain of debt.", "authors": ["James Salmon For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
