It's personal, it's our bodies, and of course it's our time, and it's not necessarily everyone's dream to be a mom ... but it's mine, so I'm fine.\"\n\n\"Anna just wants to know what the people want to know,\" she added.\n\nThe star added that it's \"unbelievable\" to her that her current Vogue cover is her sixth, saying, \"I can't believe that Anna Wintour wanted me on her cover once, much less six times.\"\n\nAs for the new book, \"Rihanna by Rihanna,\" the \"Work\" singer says she chose all the photos for the project herself, and there are more than a thousand of them.\n\nIt took her five years to create, she says, adding, \"My fans are going to be really thrilled.\"", "description": "Anna Wintour asked Rihanna,", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/rihanna-nyc-gty-ps-191014_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
