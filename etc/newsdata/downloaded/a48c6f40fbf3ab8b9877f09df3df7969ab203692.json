It was not Liverpool who stumbled at home, but Manchester City. A shock defeat to Wolves leaves them eight points behind the league leaders, facing an uphill task to retain their title.\n\nCity have already dropped more points at home than they did last season but Wolves, incisive in attack and dogged in defence, could savour a historic win. They had not triumphed away at City in the top flight since 1979 and Adama Traore\u2019s late brace was the reward they merited for an outstanding performance.\n\nWolves had beaten all of the rest of the big six last season. Now they have added the scalp of City and, after their slow start to the league season, they are resembling their old selves.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

They missed the injured Kevin de Bruyne and while David Silva struck the bar with a free-kick, Pep Guardiola\u2019s side had precious little inspiration. This was the antithesis of the Etihad Stadium\u2019s previous Premier League game, the 8-0 evisceration of Watford.\n\nWhile City were muted, Wolves scarcely looked a team who had played in Turkey 68 hours earlier and even the early loss of Romain Saiss did not disturb them. They showed organisation, concentration and determination. They had a well-configured defence, crowded the centre of the pitch and released their strikers on the counter-attack. Those forwards should have found the net in a match sooner that doubled up as an illustration of Nicolas Otamendi\u2019s shortcomings.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Joao Cancelo - 4/10 He has only played 36 minutes in a City shirt despite being one of the best full backs in Europe. His time will come, but at the moment he is experiencing the same frustration Danilo endured behind Kyle Walker. Manchester City FC via Getty Ima 2/20 19. Moise Kean - 4/10 Last season he emerged as one of the best young forwards in Europe at Juventus. He has failed to live up to the hype so far at Everton, but it\u2019s still early in his Premier League career. Everton FC via Getty Images 3/20 18. David Luiz - 4/10 His move surprised many when he joined Arsenal from London rivals Chelsea. He has been at fault for numerous goals since his arrival, including a nightmare performance at Anfield. Improvement needed. Getty Images 4/20 17. Giovani Lo Celso - 5/10 The Argentinian's hotly anticipated arrival in London has been blighted by a hip injury that's restricted him to 44 minutes in the Premier League. Getty Images 5/20 16. Joelinton - 5.5/10 When Rondon left St James Park last season, fans were worried they\u2019d struggle to replace him. Joelinton has only managed one goal in his last seven game, however, there have been promising flashes from the Brazilian. Getty Images 6/20 15. Raul Jimenez - 6/10 After last season\u2019s 13 goals and 10 assists, Jimenez will no doubt prove a valuable acquisition for Wolves. Just two goals so far this season means he has been underwhelming. Getty Images 7/20 14. Adam Webster - 6/10 Duffy had been a stalwart in Brighton\u2019 side. Youngster Webster has managed to breakthrough in his place. Barring a poor lapse in concentration against Chelsea he has been solid. PA 8/20 13. Nicolas Pepe - 6/10 The \u00a372m winger is still adjusting to English football and has yet to recapture his goalscoring form at Lille. However, the signs of his quality are obvious for all to see. Getty Images 9/20 12. Sebastian Haller - 6.5/10 Haller started off slowly. But a brace at Watford set him on his way and he\u2019s now on three goals and one assist. If he can replicate his form from his time in Frankfurt, West Ham will be dangerous. Getty Images 10/20 11. Tyrone Mings - 6.5/10 Earned an England call-up through his performances, after making his loan spell permanent, but hasn't been able to totally sure up Villa's leaky defence. Aston Villa FC via Getty Images 11/20 10. Harry Maguire - 7/10 Has immediately improved United's defence since his impressive debut and adds leadership to a currently wildly inconsistent side. Getty Images 12/20 9. Moussa Djenepo - 7/10 Due to injury, Djenepo has only managed three appearances for Southampton. He has scored two goals though, and has brought pace and finishing ability reminiscent of Sadio Mane\u2019s time on the south coast. Action Images via Reuters 13/20 8. Aaron Wan-Bissaka - 7/10 With the most tackles in the league, Wan- Bissaka has been solid. The only criticism for the young full back? Going forward he could improve. Getty Images 14/20 7. Gary Cahill - 7.5/10 Has added some invaluable know-how to Palace\u2019s defence. A win at Old Trafford on debut and two clean sheets since then. Good start for the Champions League winner. REUTERS 15/20 6. Harry Wilson - 7.5/10 On loan from Liverpool, the young Welshman has produced moments of quality, including a long range strike (albeit deflected) at Villa Park and a delightful free kick against the Champions. Getty Images 16/20 5. Dani Ceballos - 7.5/10 The Spaniard has been superb for the most part. He has been instrumental in Arsenal\u2019s midfield. If you want to be cynical, it would be nice to see more in the goals and assist columns. UEFA via Getty Images 17/20 4. Rodrigo - 7.5/10 Has integrated relatively seamlessly into Guardiola's starting eleven and already feels as though he has been part of City's set up for a long time. Action Images via Reuters 18/20 3. Tanguy Ndombele - 7.5/10 Arguably one of the most well rounded midfielders in Europe. It\u2019s early days at Spurs but Ndombele has added goals and security in midfield. Getty Images 19/20 2. Daniel James - 8/10 What a bargain \u00a315 million was. Three goals this season and one of few causes for optimism in an abject Man Utd side. Potentially signing of the season if he keeps it up. Plus, he has all the time in the world to develop at 21 years of age. Getty Images 20/20 1. Youri Tielemans - 8.5/10 Superb start from Tielemans since joining the Foxes on a permanent basis. He is level with De Bruyne for completed through balls and has been a huge help to Maddison. Getty Images 1/20 20. Joao Cancelo - 4/10 He has only played 36 minutes in a City shirt despite being one of the best full backs in Europe.

Joao Cancelo marred his full league debut by giving the ball away and, as Raul Jimenez broke, Otamendi went to ground needlessly. The Mexican squared it for Traore to slot in his shot.\n\nHaving gone 13 months without a goal, he had two in 15 minutes when Jimenez released him on another break. It was a vindication of Nuno, who had moved the electric Traore into the forward line when he removed the wasteful Patrick Cutrone.\n\nThe Italian had miscued a shot when Otamendi, with misguided wanderlust, had left him free to run at goal. Otamendi also ended up in a characteristic pose, on his backside, when Jimenez went past him after Riyad Mahrez had somehow picked out the Mexican. Fernandinho twice came to City\u2019s rescue, first blocking Jimenez\u2019s shot and then Cutrone\u2019s effort from the rebound.\n\nWhile Rui Patricio had to save well from Raheem Sterling, the goalkeeper was underworked. It was a sign of the strength of his teammates, and quite how poor City were.", "description": "The full value of James Milner\u2019s injury-time penalty at Anfield became clear 23 hours later.
