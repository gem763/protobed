The first \"L\" is pronounced, unlike the silent \"L\" in salmon, the fish.\n\nApproximately 450 people die each year due to Salmonella.\n\nSalmonella lives in the intestinal tracts of animals, including birds, and people.\n\nPeople usually become infected by eating foods contaminated with animal feces.\n\nFoods contaminated with Salmonella are often of animal origin, such as beef, poultry, milk or eggs, but any food may become contaminated.\n\nIt rarely affects the taste, smell or appearance of food.\n\nS. typhimurium is most commonly found in food of an animal origin.\n\nS. enteritidis is mainly associated with poultry and eggs.\n\nMost recently, a specific type of Salmonella Typhimurium, DT104, has emerged that is resistant to many antibiotics. Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 can be found in a broad range of foods.\n\nSalmonella was discovered by American veterinarian Daniel Elmer Salmon.\n\nSymptoms and Treatment:\n\nSymptoms usually begin six hours to four days after infection. Typical symptoms include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Symptoms usually begin six hours to four days after infection.\n\nInfections usually resolve in three to seven days, and mild cases often do not require professional treatment. Antibiotics are used only to treat severe cases.\n\nSalmonella infections can be life-threatening especially for young children, pregnant women and their fetuses, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. The Salmonella infection can spread from the intestines to the blood stream and cause death if not treated early.\n\nA small number of persons infected with Salmonella develop reactive arthritis, which causes painful urination, joint pain and eye irritation. This condition can last for months or years and can lead to chronic arthritis.\n\nPrevention:\n\nAvoid cross-contamination of food. Keep uncooked meats separate from other food.\n\nPeople infected with Salmonella should not prepare food for others.\n\nProper storage and handling of food helps prevent the growth of Salmonella and thorough cooking destroys the bacteria. Raw or undercooked meat or eggs and raw or unpasteurized dairy products should not be consumed. Produce should be washed thoroughly.\n\nWash hands with soap after changing diapers or using the restroom.\n\nWash hands after handling pets.
