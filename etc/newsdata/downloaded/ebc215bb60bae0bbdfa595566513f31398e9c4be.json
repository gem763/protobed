We already have one quarter lower than the year before but the second is now looking more positive.\n\nWhether we are in recession or not will be confirmed on November 11.\n\nThe last time Britain entered recession, it was caused by the 2008 financial crisis and saw interest rates cut by 90%, Government debt balloon, house prices crash and a string of major companies go bust.\n\nThat falling economy is exactly what led to the austerity programme that saw most benefits frozen and spending slashed.\n\nWe're still recovering now.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIf we re-enter recession, this time it looks like it will be entirely self-inflicted.\n\nWhile the global economy and the rest the EU are still growing, three years of uncertainty around Brexit have hammered the pound and held back investment in the UK.\n\nPhil Smeaton, chief investment officer at Sanlam UK said: \u201cThe past quarter has been one of stagnant growth for the UK, whilst creeping towards the likelihood of a recession.\n\n\"Such weak growth is understandable, as investments are being delayed until clarity on the future political framework is delivered.\"\n\nHe added: \"At this point even a no deal Brexit will remove the uncertainty preventing business from doing its job.\u201d\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: \u201cThe effects of the government\u2019s failure are being felt across the economy but especially in our manufacturing sector.\n\n\u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 dangerous No Deal Brexit comes on the back of a decade of cuts and a failure to invest to tackle the long-term challenges for the economy.\n\n\u201cA Labour government will tackle the productivity crisis by ending austerity, boosting wages, and providing half a trillion pounds of lending and spending for economic transformation.\u201d", "description": "GDP figures from the Office of National Statistics show weaker than expected growth but it's still unclear if Britain will enter a new recession", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Pa", "Getty", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20550365.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Summer-weather-August-14th-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
