The protests launched in big cities worldwide by the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion are a first test.\n\nExtinction Rebellion, like Thunberg, wants governments to treat climate change as an emergency and to take urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The group blocks traffic at cities\u2019 busiest intersections. In Berlin on Tuesday, police broke up their day-long occupation of a central square, Potsdamer Platz, but hundreds of protesters continued to hold another area, around the city\u2019s Victory Column. Throughout Europe and in Sydney, Australia, hundreds of protesters have been arrested for disrupting traffic.\n\nThunberg supports the radical action; on Tuesday, she retweeted Extinction Rebellion\u2019s call on \u201crebels\u201d to \u201cstay strong.\u201d\n\nIn London, where more than 300 arrests took place, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was highly unsympathetic toward the protesters \u2013 and dismissive of Thunberg. Speaking at the launch of a Margaret Thatcher biography, he said:\n\nI hope that when we go out from this place tonight and we are waylaid by importunate nose-ringed climate change protesters we remind them that [Thatcher] was also right about greenhouse gases. And she took it seriously long before Greta Thunberg. And the best thing possible for the education of the denizens of the heaving hemp-smelling bivouacs that now litter Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park, the best thing would be for them to stop blocking the traffic and buy a copy of Charles\u2019s magnificent book so that they can learn about a true feminist, green and revolutionary who changed the world for the better.\n\nThatcher, who had a chemistry degree, was indeed an early supporter of climate science. But it's more important that Johnson has added his voice to a virtual chorus of leaders who appear to have had enough of Thunberg since her angry speech at the United Nations last month, with \u201chow dare you\u201d as a refrain.\n\nAt the milder end of the reaction spectrum, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has disagreed with Thunberg about the urgency of radical climate action, saying technological advances would give humanity some extra time. French President Emmanuel Macron criticized Thunberg for \u201cradical positions\u201d that, he said, would only \u201cantagonize\u201d our societies, and said the environmentally aware governments of France and Germany aren\u2019t the ones she should be attacking.\n\nAt the harsher end, U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, have been mocking and condescending. In contemptuous acknowledgment, Thunberg changed her Twitter profile. \u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\u201d it read, repeating the language of Trump\u2019s sarcastic tweet. And after Putin described her as a clueless victim of adult manipulation, the bio temporarily changed to \u201ca kind but poorly informed teenager.\u201d\n\nThunberg clearly is capable of giving as good as she gets. The question is, however, whether her combativeness helps or hurts her cause. At some point in recent weeks, she appears to have crossed the line between eliciting sympathy and emanating menace. Many national leaders see it as their job to do as much for the environment as is politically feasible and economically reasonable; they don\u2019t take kindly to anyone who won\u2019t give them high marks for effort.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear line, too, between the Fridays for Future school strikes Thunberg started and Extinction Rebellion. Cutting school for the climate may have struck some parents as wrong, but it was easy to sympathize with children speaking up for their future. Street blockages by adult activists are a public nuisance that leave most people cold. That\u2019s why police, who didn\u2019t disrupt the Fridays for Future demonstrations, are breaking up these protests.\n\nThunberg may be personally fine with her growing status as a polarizing figure. But polarization tends to turn nasty very fast. In Rome, someone hanged Thunberg\u2019s effigy off a bridge, horrifying the mayor and other Italian officials. That goes far beyond disagreeing with the concept of climate change as an emergency.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Political leaders around the globe have celebrated the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg \u2013\u00a0but can they handle her as she and her supporters turn more radical?
