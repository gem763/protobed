In fact, it is probably more likely to be broken than any of the 10 milestones we've compiled that could stand untouched without ever being overhauled.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n1) Smallest title-winning margin\n\n(0 points, 8 goal difference from Man City in 2011/12)\n\nThe drama of the the 2011/12 Premier League title race will never be forgotten - and we might never see such a tight finish again.\n\nSergio Aguero's last-gasp goal gave Manchester City the title on goal difference ahead of local rivals Manchester United, with the sides tied on 89 points but City holding an eight-goal swing over the Red Devils.\n\nThere have been some tight title races before and after in the Premier League, including City again involved in a close battle to finish a point clear of Liverpool just last season.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nBut we'll likely have to wait a very long time if we're ever to see a Premier League title race decided on goal difference, with nothing else to separate the two sides over a 38-game season.\n\nIt's still not the closest title race in English football history, however, and the fact that Arsenal stunned Liverpool on goals scored on the final day in 1988/89 shows that, in extraordinary circumstances, the record could fall one day.\n\n2) Fewest points in a season\n\n(11 points - Derby County in 2007/08)\n\nDerby County were alarmingly bad during the 2007/08 season - and we'll probably never see a repeat again.\n\nFor context, their 11-point haul over the course of the campaign is not just the worst ever Premier League total, it's also the lowest points total for any English Football League team in the era of three points for a win.\n\nWith the financial reward for reaching the top flight, but also the money on offer in the top end of the Championship, it is highly unlikely we will ever see a team reach the top flight as unprepared and unable to at least turn things around with some January spending.\n\n(Image: Action Images)\n\nPromoted sides have generally shown a reduced gulf between the Championship and bottom half of the Premier League when coming up in recent years.\n\nEven those that struggle comfortably manage to exceed 11 points. For context, the worst team since that Derby side were Huddersfield last year, and even the woeful Terriers reached 16 points.\n\nDerby also hold the unenviable record of least goals in a Premier League season during their disastrous campaign, finding the net just 20 times in 38 games.\n\nThey could hold those two unwanted milestones forever, barring any sides being given big points deductions.\n\n3) Fewest points in a season while winning the league\n\n(75 points - Man Utd in 1996/97)\n\nBack in 1996/97, Manchester United won the Premier League with just 75 points.\n\nLast season, 97 points was not enough for Liverpool to lift the trophy.\n\nThe growing riches of the Premier League and Champions League has led to an increasing gulf between the big six and the rest of the top flight.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAs a result, the top sides tend to pile up bigger points totals, making a wide-open league with such a small total required to finish top unlikely to be repeated.\n\nOn average, 86.9 points are needed to win the Premier League, but the last three seasons have seen totals of 98, 100 ad 93.\n\nEven when Leicester stunned the big six, they did so with 81 points.\n\n4) Most consecutive games undefeated\n\n(49 games - Arsenal - 7 May 2003 to 24 October 2004)\n\nArsenal's unbeaten Invincibles season of 2003/04 has legendary status - and rightly so.\n\nBut their overall unbeaten run extended to 49 games, starting in May 2003 and ending just short of a half century against Manchester United well over a year later.\n\nThe next longest run - 40 games from Chelsea under Jose Mourinho - shows the magnitude of Arsenal's achievement under Wenger.\n\n(Image: John Peters/Manchester United via Getty)\n\nThe fact Pep Guardiola's record-breaking Manchester City side have been unable to go a season unbeaten shows how hard the feat is to achieve.\n\nIt is something we might never see again, and the 49 game unbeaten run looks even harder to match.\n\n5) Lowest attendance\n\n(3,039 - Wimbledon 1\u20133 Everton - Selhurst Park, 26 January 1993)\n\nThis is probably the record we're most confident will never be broken.\n\nJust marginally more than 3,000 people were at Selhurst Park as tenants Wimbledon took on Everton in January 1993.\n\nThe unique situation of the club playing without a proper home means they account for all of the 40 lowest attendances in Premier League history.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nPremier League stadium requirements mean we will almost certainly never see a stadium host a game with a capacity of less than the record, and the magnitude of the Premier League nowadays means demand for tickets is always hot.\n\nIt would take remarkable circumstances - such as punishment to ban sections of supporters or a mass protest - to even come close to an attendances lower than 3,039.\n\n6) Oldest player\n\n(John Burridge - 43 years and 162 days for Manchester City vs QPR, 14 May 1995)\n\nGoalkeeper John Burridge was 43 years old when he lined up for Manchester City against Queens Park Rangers at the end of the 1994/95 Premier League season.\n\nThe likes of Mark Schwartzer, Alec Chamberlain and Brad Friedel have since gone close to his milestone but fallen short - and Burridge could remain the ultimate golden oldie.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe increasing pace and intensity of the game at the highest level means players are seemingly hitting their peak earlier as it becomes harder to keep up with the demands.\n\nThis season, the oldest player to be used is 37-year-old Phil Jagielka.\n\nIt's certainly doubtful we'll ever see a player old than Burridge on a Premier League pitch.\n\n7) Fastest goal\n\n(7.69 seconds - Shane Long for Southampton vs Watford , 23 April 2019)\n\nThe most recent record on the list, Shane Long struck after just 7.69 seconds for Southampton against Watford at the end of last season.\n\nThe Irishman pounced on a loose pass almost immediately from kick-off - and it's hard to imagine how a quicker goal could possibly be scored.\n\nThere have been quicker goals in history but they are extremely rare.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe previous benchmark beaten by Long was 9.9 seconds by Ledley King, set back in 2000.\n\nThe fact he beat a record which stood for 19 years by a relatively substantial margin suggests it will certainly prove tough to beat.\n\nIt is also the fastest goal scored in any of Europe's top four leagues - the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and Bundesliga.\n\n8) Fastest Premier League hat-trick\n\n(2 minutes 56 seconds - Sadio Man\u00e9 for Southampton vs Aston Villa, 16 May 2015)\n\nSadio Mane stunned Aston Villa back in May 2015, taking less then three minutes to score a hat-trick for Southampton.\n\nIt proved a sign of things to come, as the Senegalese striker has gone on to become a global superstar for Liverpool.\n\nAnd he could have his name etched in the Premier League record books forever as a result of his achievement.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nHe broke a record that had stood for over 20 years , and did so by some margin.\n\nRobbie Fowler previously held the record in 4 minutes and 33 seconds.\n\nCan anyone do it quicker than Mane? We doubt it.\n\n9) Longest spell as manager\n\n(21 years, 224 days - Ars\u00e8ne Wenger - Arsenal - 1 October 1996 to 13 May 2018)\n\nWhen Arsene Wenger left Arsenal at the end of the 2017/18 season, not long after Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United departure, most felt it marked the end of an era.\n\nIt is also an era of the ilk we are unlikely to ever see again.\n\nThe lucrative offerings and pressures of the Premier League, and modern football in general, have changed the dynamic as far as managers are concerned.\n\nFans and clubs demand instant success, and whilst some are slower than others to pull the trigger when things don't go to plan, it's hard to see anyone lasting over two decades in the same dugout again.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAt present, the longest-serving Premier League manager is Sean Dyche after nearly seven years at Burnley, meaning Wenger's record cannot physically be broken for at least 14 years.\n\nEven accounting the whole Football League it is only eight years from Jim Bentley at Morcecambe.\n\nWenger is likely to be the last of the long-running Premier League bosses.\n\n10) Most seasons scored in\n\n(21 - Ryan Giggs - 1992/93 to 2012/13)\n\nRyan Giggs enjoyed a stunning career, from his breakthrough as a teenage to his longevity late in his career.\n\nOne-club man Giggs made an impact and scored goals throughout, bagging goals in a record-breaking 21 straight Premier League seasons.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAs mentioned with regards to Burridge, the pace and intensity of the Premier League means the longevity of players is largely reduced nowadays, particularly those in midfield and attack when they lose a yard of pace.\n\nAs a result, it is hard to see anyone continuing to have an impact by scoring goals for 21 straight seasons as Giggs managed to do.", "description": "Liverpool fell just one game short of matching Man City's record of 18 consecutive Premier League wins", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty", "Action Images", "John Peters Manchester United Via Getty", "Afp Getty Images", "Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19032355.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-City-v-Liverpool-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
