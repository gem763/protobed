My nips looked so sad behind that cheap plastic.\u2019\n\nShe added that the plastic wasn\u2019t at all flexible but more like \u2018Christmas tree decorations cut in half\u2019.\n\nIt was described as \u2018like a Christmas bauble cut it half\u2019 (Picture: Wish)\n\nShe said she decided to buy it as she works as a stripper and it cost just \u00a31.99 but said that it fell apart within 30 seconds of putting it on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Hooks are clear, straps are pingy death traps and the whole thing broke in 30 seconds. It was a wild ride and I hated it, all for \u00a31.99,\u2019 she said.\n\nAnother person said that they\u2019d also tried it out but were confused that it only came in one size.\n\nThey said: \u2018I too brought this for the shits and gigs. I hate the 1 cup size thing. I have DD boobies. Its not a DD bolder holder. It looked like a shar pei smooshed into a glass vase. Was an experience.\u2019\n\nAlthough most others hadn\u2019t tried it, they agreed it didn\u2019t look very comfortable.\n\n\u2018My boobs are sweating profusely just looking at it,\u2019 one said.\n\n\u2018Why? Just why? This looks both extremely uncomfortable and extremely unflattering for any body type,\u2019 another added.\n\nMORE: Dream job alert: earn \u00a32k a week staying in luxury homes\n\nMORE: You can now stay in Jim Beam\u2019s bourbon distillery \u2013 and it costs just \u00a318 a night\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "People are confused by this plastic bra from Wish and Shein and a woman has shared her thoughts about it on Reddit.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90845084_1571586529.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
