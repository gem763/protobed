Now foes say they have a solution.", "language": "en", "text": "ELKO COUNTY, Nev. \u2014 Wild horses may be symbols of the wide-open American West, but J.J. Goicoechea watched them warily. Under a bright desert sky, about 20 mustangs munched on the crested wheatgrass meant for the Angus cattle he grazes here on public land.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look up to them. They\u2019re tough,\u201d the fourth-generation rancher said, leaning against his dusty red truck. \u201cBut if we turn a blind eye, in five years there will be 100 horses here, and it won\u2019t look as good.\u201d\n\nJ.J. Goicoechea's ranch home is bathed in dawn light. The fourth-generation rancher is Nevada\u2019s state veterinarian. Goicoechea drives his tractor while harvesting hay for the winter in Newark Valley. Though he insists he likes wild horses, he\u2019s seen land he claims they ruined. Goicoechea drives past his cows in Newark Valley, where he has grazing rights from the BLM.\n\nTOP: J.J.

BOTTOM RIGHT: Goicoechea drives past his cows in Newark Valley, where he has grazing rights from the BLM.\n\nGoicoechea has long been on one side of the battle over wild horses and burros, an issue so contentious that Congress, animal advocates, conservationists, ranchers and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have long been in a stalemate. Everyone agrees the situation is untenable: The government says three times more equines roam public land than the fragile terrain can handle. To address this, the BLM, which is charged with managing most of the animals, periodically rounds up horses and now has nearly 50,000 in holding. The agency says caring for the warehoused animals devours most of its wild horse budget, leaving little for other approaches.\n\nHorse advocates call the roundups cruel, contend that millions of cattle do vastly more damage to public lands than thousands of horses, and insist mustangs must never be killed. Ranchers and some environmentalists view the horses as feral pests that damage ecosystems, compete for resources with cattle and wildlife and should be culled or sold.\n\nBut against this conflict, at a time of deep political polarization, something almost unrecognizable is floating around Capitol Hill: a compromise. Over three years, major ranching and hunting organizations, represented by Goicoechea and others, quietly negotiated with animal welfare groups, including the Humane Society of the United States. These strange bedfellows recently unveiled a wild horse proposal that they say meets both sides\u2019 goals: It keeps mustangs alive, and it gets a lot more off the land.\n\nThere are just a couple catches: It would cost $50 million a year, swelling the BLM\u2019s horse budget by two-thirds. And most wild horse advocacy groups hate it.\n\n\n\nLaura Leigh, founder of Wild Horse Education, stands in front of other wild horse advocates, documenting the BLM wild horse processing area near Ely, Nev.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThe 10-year proposal calls for scaling up the roundups, or \u201cgathers,\u201d that animal activists have long despised \u2014 capturing up to 20,000 horses and burros each year. Those horses would live in private pastures or sanctuaries that provide cheaper and \u201cmore natural living situations\u201d than the corrals the BLM now depends on. Wild horse adoptions, which last year numbered about 3,100, would have to increase, the plan says. Its final pillar is aggressive use of fertility control, such as PZP, an injection delivered annually by dart.\n\n\u201cThis plan doesn\u2019t benefit the horses at all, or taxpayers. It benefits the livestock industry,\u201d said Grace Kuhn, spokeswoman for the American Wild Horse Campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s more business as usual that could end in the mass killing of America\u2019s wild horses.\u201d\n\nThe alliance behind the plan, which includes one prominent wild horse organization, dismisses that as a misrepresentation of their proposal \u2014 and of political reality. Although the 1971 federal law that protects wild horses and burros allows the interior secretary to euthanize older and unadopted animals or sell them for slaughter, Congress has for much of the past three decades blocked those powers in annual appropriations bills.\n\nBut as the free-roaming and fast-reproducing horse and burro population mushrooms \u2014 from 40,000 in 2013 to 88,000 last year, according to the BLM \u2014 support for the animals has wobbled. President Trump\u2019s budget has called for sales and killing, as have House appropriators and the BLM\u2019s wild horse advisory committee. The status quo, a bureau official told lawmakers in July, could result in half a million horses on the range by 2030.\n\n\u201cWe heard from key members of Congress that \u2026 they were leaning more and more toward letting the agency have the authority to kill horses,\u201d said Gillian Lyons, a senior legislative specialist for the Humane Society Legislative Fund.\n\nOne of Goicoechea's cows crosses the road in front of his truck after getting through a fence.

RIGHT: Troughs where water used to be pumped at the Antelope Valley Complex, which is managed by the BLM, near Eureka, Nev. Goicoechea said the water was shut off in an effort to pull the wild horse herds away from the sagebrush and help maintain the plant species for grazing.\n\nThe ranching groups say they had come to believe the opposite \u2014 that Congress, regularly besieged by impassioned pleas from horse lovers, would never permit the culling of a symbol of the American spirit.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see the world the same way,\u201d Ethan Lane, executive director of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association and of the Public Lands Council, said of animal welfare groups. \u201cThe only way this has been successful is us recognizing their concerns over how these horses are managed and them recognizing our concerns over how the rangelands are managed.\u201d\n\nFertility control could be a compromise. Neither ranchers nor the BLM have ever bought into contraception as a large-scale solution: Last year, the bureau treated just 702 wild horses.\n\nBut modeling by ecologists and economists \u2014 brought in by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, another member of the alliance \u2014 found that if fertility control were administered to about 90 percent of mares that remain on the range, then roundups could dramatically slow after four years. After 10 years, it says, about 38,000 horses would roam the West, much closer to the government\u2019s target population of 27,000. By then, roundups would be rare, and the few gathered horses could be adopted out, the plan posits.\n\n\u201cI believe in this proposal,\u201d said Goicoechea, who participated in negotiations on behalf of the beef association and Eureka County, Nev., where he is a commissioner. He said he thinks it would require the development of long-term contraception such as horse IUDs, but he found the modeling convincing. \u201cThose graphs, it hits you hard.\u201d\n\nGoicoechea said he was \u201cvery skeptical\u201d when approached in 2015 by the Humane Society, an organization best known among ranchers for campaigns against slaughterhouses and for Meatless Mondays. He agreed to attend a meeting in Reno, but he didn\u2019t tell peers.\n\n\n\nA wild horse canters away on land managed by the BLM near Ely, Nev.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nInitial meetings fell apart over horse advocates\u2019 refusal to entertain euthanasia, participants said. After ranching representatives agreed to take killing off the table, meetings resumed last year in Utah, with a push from Rep. Chris Stewart (R). Goicoechea now talks up the plan at county meetings, and he testified about it in July before a Senate subcommittee.\n\nGoicoechea, who is also Nevada\u2019s state veterinarian, insists he likes wild horses. But he said he\u2019s seen them starve in dry years, and he\u2019s seen land he claims they ruined.\n\n\u201cI know that white mare, and I can tell you when she was born \u2014 two years ago,\u201d he said, pointing to a horse whose tail whipped lightly in the midsummer wind. But, he said, \u201cthey have to be managed appropriately.\u201d\n\n\n\nBLM officials prepare trailers before the start of a wild horse gather near Ely, Nev. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018Traumatic, senseless roundups\u2019\n\nThe day after Goicoechea watched the mare, the BLM began a three-week roundup in the area. The agency said the 1.6-million acre swath of eastern Nevada was home to more than 3,300 wild horses, or four times above its \u201cappropriate management level.\u201d The animals were hazards to workers at a nearby gold mine, a BLM official said: There had been 14 horse-vehicle collisions since December.\n\nA helicopter herds a group of wild horses toward a BLM trap.

Wild horses are unloaded from a truck at the BLM's National Wild Horse and Burro Center in Reno, Nev.

BOTTOM RIGHT: Wild horses are unloaded from a truck at the BLM's National Wild Horse and Burro Center in Reno, Nev. Wild horses and burros are taken to the center to be prepared for either adoption or transfer.\n\nShortly after 9 a.m., a helicopter emerged over a faraway ridge. Like a buzzing sheepdog, it herded a band of frightened mustangs running below toward a \u201cJudas horse\u201d \u2014 a domestic animal that led its wild cousins down a burlap-lined corridor that dead-ended in a pen. Among the horses was the white mare.\n\nOver four hours, two helicopters pushed 117 horses into the trap. Foals, some weeks old, struggled to keep up. A lone black stallion stumbled under the chopper before relenting and heading into the pen, the gate clanging behind him.\n\nThree horses were later euthanized due to injuries, the BLM said.\n\nWatching from a distant hill were a few activists, including Laura Leigh, who has sued the agency over its treatment of wild horses during roundups and other policies and won. When asked about the proposal, she scoffed. It did not address overgrazing by livestock and ignored mining and gas projects that squeeze horses out of public land, she said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on out here. They\u2019re drug salesmen,\u201d she said of the Humane Society, which holds a federal registration for PZP but insists it does not profit from it. \u201cThey sold the wild horse down the river.\u201d\n\nOther critics, including the former CEO of the Humane Society, have been similarly scathing. The proposal is vague, they say, and could allow surgical sterilization of mares, a procedure viewed by horse advocates as brutally invasive. Eventually, the cost of feeding all the horses in holding would provide an opening for mass euthanasia, they say.\n\nThe criticism has hit Return to Freedom, a California-based horse advocacy group that signed onto the plan. It has lost donors and battled accusations that it supports roundups and sterilization. But Neda DeMayo, the group\u2019s CEO, said the plan is an opportunity to prove fertility control can work, even in large areas where horses are difficult to reach.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have a chance at shifting management to move away from these traumatic, senseless roundups and move toward better solutions in the near future is critical,\u201d DeMayo said. Ranchers, she added, \u201care not going to say, \u2018Thanks guys, we\u2019re just going to take our cows off now.\u2019 A huge step forward is that there is conversation.\u201d\n\n\n\nWild horses stand in pens at the BLM wild horse processing area near Ely, Nev. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nWhether Congress will agree is an open question. House appropriators budgeted $6 million for a pilot version of the proposal \u2014 a \u201cnot serious,\u201d sum, according to Lane, the beef association lobbyist. The Senate has yet to weigh in.\n\nThe day after the roundup near the mine, three semis pulled up across the state outside Reno, at the largest BLM horse holding and adoption center in the country. Inside the trucks were the horses captured the day before.\n\nWorkers separated the animals into groups \u2014 stallions to one corral; nursing mares and foals to another; \u201cdry\u201d mares to another. Among the dry mares was the white one Goicoechea had recognized.\n\nOver the next few weeks, she\u2019d be branded and vaccinated. She might be adopted here. But more likely, she\u2019d be shipped out to a federally funded corral or pasture \u2014 one more horse off the range and into government storage.\n\n\n\nWild horses that have been adopted stand in a pen together waiting to be picked up at the BLM's National Wild Horse and Burro Center.
