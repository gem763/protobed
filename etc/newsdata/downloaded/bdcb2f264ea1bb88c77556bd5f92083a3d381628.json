Not surprisingly, given that manager Graeme Jones made 10 changes, a Luton team still acclimatising in the Championship after successive promotions proved something of a mismatch.\n\nAyoze Perez, Youri Tielemans and Dennis Praet were the big-money signings on display in Luton\u2019s throwback Kenilworth Road ground, although the spotlight was taken by someone with a special affection for the place who cost a little less.\n\nJames Justin, the England Under-21 defender who moved from Luton to Leicester for an undisclosed fee (thought to be around \u00a36 million), marked his debut with a goal against his former club.\n\nLeicester were in control before half-time, going ahead through Demarai Gray, who finished off what looked like a well-rehearsed routine after Perez had helped on a near-post corner from Marc Albrighton.\n\nJustin had his moment just before the break. The right-back had already shown a willingness to join in with attacks and he arrived in just the right place to drive home a Tielemans cross on the half-volley. There was applause from all round the ground, acknowledged by the Luton-born player, whose own celebration was respectfully restrained.\n\nLuton fought gamely, but mainly in their own half, not managing a shot until the 68th minute, when substitute Izzy Brown drew a decent save from Danny Ward. Leicester added further goals through Tielemans and substitute Kelechi Iheanacho.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAs soon as I knew the draw I had this match in my mind,\u201d Justin said. \u201cIt was the debut I wanted and to be applauded by the Luton fans after I had scored against them was amazing. I just want them to know how much I appreciate everything they did for me.\u201d\n\nMatch details\n\nLuton Town (4-3-3): Shea; Bolton, Jones, Sheehan, Potts; Berry, Butterfield, Mpanzu; McManaman (LuaLua 72), Lee (Cornick 60), Moncur (Brown 60).\n\nSubstitutes not used: Sluga (g), Tunnicliffe, Pearson, Bree.\n\n\n\nLeicester City (4-1-4-1): Ward; Justin, Morgan, Evans, Fuchs; Ndidi (Choudhury 77); Gray, Praet, Tielemans, Albrighton; Perez (Iheanacho 71).\n\nSubstitutes not used: Schmeichel (g), Pereira, Amartey, Barnes, Vardy.\n\n\n\nReferee: Matt Donohue (Cheshire)\n\nAttendance: 6,216.\n\n", "description": "Leicester City, a side with lofty ambitions again under Brendan Rodgers, eased into the fourth round of a competition for which they would consider themselves realistic contenders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pIEiZUg9SihkDmcAs_FKYg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cuGh4UgFboa.nQLjyPTNQQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/add5418ed84e6d1cf30e20fb310b77e8", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
