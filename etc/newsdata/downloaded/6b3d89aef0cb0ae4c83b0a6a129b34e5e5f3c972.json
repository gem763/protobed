But some experts say criminalising carnivores could do more harm than good\n\nThat late-night kebab might be considered a guilty pleasure, but could it one day be seen as a crime against the planet? Will the time come when the only means of procuring a slab of Aberdeen Angus is from a dodgy dealer with a cool box? The barrister Michael Mansfield has suggested that we should have new laws against ecocide \u2013 practices that destroy the planet \u2013 and that under them, meat could be targeted. \u201cI think when we look at the damage eating meat is doing to the planet, it is not preposterous to think that one day it will become illegal,\u201d he said.\n\nA study last year by researchers at the University of Oxford, published in the journal Nature, showed meat and dairy produces 60% of agriculture\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and takes up 83% of farmland, but delivers just 18% of calories and 37% of protein.\n\n\u201cA vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,\u201d said Joseph Poore, who led the research.\n\nTaxes on red meat have been discussed, but is a ban the way to go? \u201cThere is not a single magic bullet,\u201d says Tim Benton, a professor of population ecology at the University of Leeds. \u201cYou could think about changing agricultural subsidies, trade laws, changing what is eaten in hospitals and schools to train people to eat differently. You can think labelling and education, and carbon taxes. All of those have a role but none by themselves will solve the issue, and the idea of saying we\u2019re going to make meat illegal becomes somewhat farcical.\u201d\n\nBetter, he says, to change farming practices to ensure meat has a smaller impact and to wean ourselves off eating so much. \u201cThat, to me, is a much more sensible future \u2013 that we start saying it\u2019s a treat and we should treat it with the respect it deserves.\u201d However, it is worth bearing in mind that even low-impact meat production produces more greenhouse gas emissions than plant substitutes, according to Poore\u2019s study.\n\nDon\u2019t we need something drastic, such as a ban, to turn us all vegan? \u201cI think it might be a step too far,\u201d says Lorraine Whitmarsh, a professor of environmental psychology at Cardiff University. \u201cOur latest survey results show people have mixed feelings about whether we should reduce the amount of meat we consume. Just over half of the public think we should, whereas 67% think we should reduce the amount of flying that we do. So while people are on board with something that previously was seen as quite controversial \u2013 reducing flying \u2013 meat consumption is something I think is going to be harder to tackle.\u201d\n\nTalking about banning it, she says, \u201cmight provoke a defensive reaction and risks alienating people who are maybe coming round to the idea that we need to do something about climate change\u201d.", "description": "A barrister has called for new laws against practices that harm the environment \u2013 including eating meat.
