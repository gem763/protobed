A good chunk of Pelosi\u2019s caucus was already chafing at her reluctance to push forward. The Ukraine episode will inevitably create a new front in the oversight wars, with Congress demanding to see transcripts of exactly what Trump has been saying in these calls. This wasn\u2019t an incident from two or three years ago that Congress has obsessed over; this was in July.\n\nTalking to reporters in the Oval Office today, Trump didn\u2019t dispute that he had spoken to his Ukrainian counterpart about Biden. Indeed, in reference to Biden\u2019s attempts as vice president to get Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor fired, Trump said, \u201cSomebody ought to look into that.\u201d (Biden wanted the prosecutor, who had at one time investigated the gas company, dismissed from his office as part of a broader push against corruption in Ukraine.)\n\nIf Trump\u2019s call for Ukraine\u2019s assistance sounds familiar, it should. During the 2016 election, he called on Russia to unearth emails missing from his rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s computer server. He made that plea in public, during a press conference, but it now seems an eerie foreshadow of the Ukraine request. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said. Later that same day, Russian hackers made an effort to penetrate the server.\n\nAlmost a year later, Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed, in part, to investigate whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to defeat Clinton, an investigation that shadowed Trump\u2019s presidency and upset him to no end. But if today\u2019s multiple press reports are right, it seems he learned little from the ordeal.\n\nRead: Corey Lewandowski tried to make a mockery of the House\n\nThough, really, that\u2019s been evident for a while: In an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos in June, Trump said that if foreign powers offered him damaging information about political opponents, he might well take a look without alerting the FBI. \u201cI think you might want to listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything wrong with listening.\u201d\n\nRank-and-file Democrats have been inching toward impeachment proceedings against the wishes of the House leadership. Through the summer, a steady stream of lawmakers publicly announced their support for the president\u2019s removal. The House Judiciary Committee only just began its impeachment investigation, hauling the president\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski into a hearing earlier this week. Lawmakers have largely been replowing old ground, sifting through the Mueller report, trying to obtain Trump\u2019s taxes, and investigating how he\u2019s benefited financially through the presidency.\n\nLast month, Pelosi told fellow Democrats on a conference call that \u201cthe public isn\u2019t there on impeachment.\u201d Yet in her statement today, she sounded a more ominous note: \u201cIf the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy.\u201d", "description": "New reports about President Trump\u2019s calls with the Ukrainian president could push Nancy Pelosi to recalculate the politics of an attempt to remove him from office.", "authors": ["Peter Nicholas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19263618309418/facebook.jpg?1569011565", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
