He was responding to a story in the New York Times that claimed the intelligence officer had given Mr Schiff advance warning of his complaint about Mr Trump\u2019s behaviour during the Ukraine call. CNN quoted an attorney for the whistleblower saying Mr Schiff had \u201cabsolutely not\u201d helped draft the complaint.\n\nThe president grew angry after he was pressed by Reuters reporter Jeff Mason about what exactly he wanted from Mr Zelensky. After giving a rambling answer and being asked again, Mr Trump paused before saying: \u201cAre you talking to me? Listen, listen. You ready? We have the president of Finland. Ask him a question.\u201d Pressed again, he said: \u201cDid you hear me? Did you hear me? Ask him a question.\u201d\n\nWhen Mason did ask the Finnish president a question Mr Trump immediately interrupted and answered it himself, leaving Mr Niinisto to say: \u201cBut I think the question is for me.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Pompeo had said demands for five members of staff to appear before House committees in the coming days were \u201cunfeasible\u201d. Two of the five \u2013 the former US envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, and the former ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch \u2013 have agreed to appear.\n\nThe president has spent recent days lashing out at the whistleblower and White House officials who reportedly gave them information to include in their complaint, telling a group of his staff at the United Nations last week: \u201cThe spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently.\u201d\n\nDuring his Oval Office appearance on Wednesday, Mr Trump referred to Ms Pelosi and Mr Schiff as \u201cthe do nothing Democrats\u201d and said they should focus on issues impacting the US like prescription drug prices and homelessness rather than impeachment.\n\nHe also issued fresh attacks just before the meeting on Twitter, saying the Democrats were wasting their time on \u201cBULLSH**\u201d.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains, honor and strength of secretary of state Mike Pompeo,\u201d Mr Trump wrote. \u201cFor a lowlife like Schiff, who completely fabricated my words and read them to Congress as though they were said by me, to demean a First in Class at West Point, is SAD!\u201d\n\nHis tweets in defence of Mr Pompeo came after the US secretary of state confirmed he was listening in on the controversial phone call with Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky, after previously declining to admit he was even aware of the conversations in an interview with ABC.\n\nThe president appeared to be tweeting about the Democrats\u2019 joint press conference in real-time, writing in a separate tweet: \u201cNancy Pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices & working on the desperately needed USMCA.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is incapable of working on either,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment.
