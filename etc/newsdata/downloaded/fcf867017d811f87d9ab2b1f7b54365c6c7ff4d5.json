This incredibly simple formula produces the Manhattan, one of the most complex and delicious cocktails of all time.\n\nA drink so good it \u201cchanged the face of cocktails,\u201d wrote bartending legend Gary Regan in the Joy of Mixology. \u201cQuite simply, when properly constructed, it is the finest cocktail on the face of the Earth.\u201d\n\nWhile the ratio of its ingredients has certainly fluctuated over time and can vary from bartender to bartender, the drink is fairly straightforward to make. However, the devil is in the details and since writing The Manhattan: The Story of the First Modern Cocktail, I have been asked over and over again by friends, relatives and even barflies, the same three questions about the recipe.\n\nIn hopes of setting the record straight, here are my answers, which just might surprise you. Cheers!\n\nSHOULD I USE BOURBON OR RYE?\n\nWell, that\u2019s a good question. If you look in vintage cocktail books, the earliest known Manhattan recipes are found in three books from 1884: George Winters\u2019 How to Mix Drinks, O.H. Byron\u2019s The Modern Bartenders\u2019 Guide, and J.W. Gibson\u2019s Scientific Bar-Keeping. Even if you\u2019re able to track down copies of these works, the recipes, disappointingly, just call for \u201cwhisk(e)y.\u201d\n\nNot until the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas\u2019 pioneering Bar-Tender\u2019s Guide do we find a specific spirit being called for and that whiskey is, indeed, rye. Thomas wasn\u2019t alone in his selection\u2014the spirit is called for in the 1898 edition of The Police Gazette Bartenders Guide.\n\nBut rye wasn\u2019t universally used and a few years earlier the Boston Herald reported that \u201cA Manhattan cocktail, by the way, is a very good drink just before dinner. It is the ordinary vermouth cocktail with a foundation of first-rate Bourbon whiskey. I do not advise the Boston Herald readers to drink anything, but, if they will drink, I think they will agree with me that a Manhattan cocktail is about as good as anything that can be manufactured.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, this is perhaps the last time anyone in Boston wrote something nice about something coming out of New York, but I digress.\n\nSo, what should you use? I like rye for a spicier Manhattan and I like bourbon for a sweeter one. Which one should you have? I guess that depends upon the mood you\u2019re in. Both are delicious in my book.\n\nLEMON PEEL, CHERRY OR SOME OTHER GARNISH?\n\nWhile most Manhattans are usually now garnished with a cherry, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Going back to J.W. Gibson\u2019s Scientific Bar-Keeping, the reader is instructed to \u201csqueeze the juice of a lemon rind\u201d over the drink prior to serving. And both Jerry Thomas and Harry Johnson\u2019s Bartenders\u2019 Manual also call for a lemon twist.\n\nIt\u2019s not until George Kappeler\u2019s 1895 Modern American Drinks do we find anyone suggesting a cherry garnish. But the fruit wasn\u2019t universally adopted. In 1903, in the Bartenders\u2019 Encyclopedia, author Tim Dalydirects his reader to garnish the Manhattan with either a cherry or olive.\n\nOn the topic of the cherry, cocktail folklore tells us that the first time it was used to garnish a Manhattan was at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. The story was reported in a trade journal called Mixer and Server, published by the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Alliance and the Bartenders International League of America. A 1911 issue explains that Colonel Neumeister, \u201cthe Chicago millionaire cheese manufacturer\u2026was the originator of the \u2018cherry in the cocktail.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt seems that Neumeister had cornered the market on cherries but, alas, no one was buying cherries and he was in jeopardy of taking a big loss. He \u201chad over a thousand cases of the cherries that he could not dispose of for four dollars a case to bakers and confectioners, the only ones that had any use for them.\u201d One day, however, Neumeister had an inspiration, \u201che put a cherry into a Manhattan cocktail which was being served to himself and his friend, Potter Palmer, the foremost hotel man in Chicago at the time, and the proprietor of the world-famous Palmer House. And right there was born the cherry in the cocktail idea that is used now in every civilized country in the world.\u201d\n\nThe story goes on to report that \u201ca week later cherries were worth fifteen dollars a case and following the lead of the Palmer House bar, were used in nearly every bar in Chicago, New York and other cities\u2026and in thirty days the fad had extended to the Pacific Coast.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s a great story, I\u2019m not sure if Neumeister really had anything to do with the popularization of the cherry garnish. But what I can tell you is don\u2019t settle for the standard stemmed maraschino cherries you\u2019ll find in most grocery stores, they\u2019re artificially colored and a flavor abomination. I recommend Traverse City Whiskey\u2019s excellent cocktail cherries, or those offered widely by Amareno Fabbri and Luxardo, they\u2019re all superb.\n\nIS THERE A RIGHT RATIO?\n\nMany professional and home bartenders use the standard formula of 2-1-2 for their Manhattans. (That is two-parts whiskey, one-part sweet vermouth and two dashes of bitters.) It\u2019s easy to remember, since the telephone area code for Manhattan was traditionally 212. But is that the right ratio of whiskey to vermouth?\n\nWell, that question is up to the drinker. Some bartenders, like New York legend Norman Bukofzer, who worked in the Ritz-Carlton overlooking Central Park, use a different ratio depending upon the strength and flavor of the whiskey selected. And that\u2019s not to mention that some drinkers add more vermouth, if they want a less boozy tipple.\n\nNow that we got that out of the way, what was the original ratio? Let\u2019s go back to the bookshelf of dusty old bartender guides. In all three of the aforementioned 1884 books from Messrs. Byron, Gibson and Winters, the drink is made up of equal parts whiskey and vermouth. Further, the above-referenced books from Jerry Thomas and the Policeman\u2019s Gazette actually call for two-parts vermouth to one-part whiskey, which is now referred to as a Reverse Manhattan.\n\nBut by the 1890s and into the 20th century, we see more and more bartenders settling into what we now consider the \u201cconventional\u201d ratio of two-parts whiskey to one-part vermouth, beginning with William \u201cThe Only William\u201d Schmidt\u2019s 1891 book The Flowing Bowl. It\u2019s also seen in Louis Muckensturm\u2019s Louis\u2019 Mixed Drinks (1906), Jacques Straub\u2019s Drinks (1914), Hugo Ensslin\u2019s Recipes for Mixed Drinks (1916), and Patrick Gavin Duffy\u2019s Official Mixers Manual (1934).\n\nThen there are the \u201cregional\u201d twists that can be applied to the Manhattan, two of which are, oddly enough, found in the American Midwest. Order a Manhattan in, say, Northern Michigan, and you\u2019ll likely get it served on the rocks, not up. Cross Lake Michigan over to Wisconsin, and you might be surprised to find your Manhattan made with brandy, not whiskey.\n\nAs they say, travel globally, drink locally, that\u2019s fine with me.", "description": "Our columnist answers the three most frequent questions he gets about the Manhattan cocktail.", "authors": ["Philip Greene"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572030556/191024-HF-old-fashioned-tease_eeq2yb", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
