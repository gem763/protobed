Respondents said that if the EU were to fall apart tomorrow, the third biggest loss \u2014 following the collapse of the single market and the euro \u2014 would be European states' ability to act as a continent-sized power in contests with global players such as China, Russia, and the United States.", "description": "With a population of more than 1.3 billion, the Chinese market is already a huge source of revenue for companies around the world \u2014 but the state's economic policies have faced heavy criticism.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103061290-GettyImages-114255829.jpg?v=1568974033", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
