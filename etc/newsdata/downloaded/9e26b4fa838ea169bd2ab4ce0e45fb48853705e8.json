U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he had authorized a release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA), which coordinates energy policies of industrialized nations, advises all its members to keep the equivalent of 90 days of net oil imports in storage.\n\nOPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo has discussed the oil market development with IEA head Fatih Birol, and both have expressed satisfaction that \u201cthe situation has been brought under control by the Saudi authorities\u201d, according to an OPEC source.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters separately on Monday that Russia should wait to see how the situation develops before taking any action on production.\n\nAccording to a Citibank note, Russia has roughly 295,000 bpd of idle oil capacity, with around half of that at top oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.MM).\n\nMost of the idle capacity \u201ccould come online in the course of a few days to a few weeks,\u201d Citi said.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Russia lead a global oil production deal in which OPEC and non-OPEC nations have agreed to reduce output by 1.2 million bpd in order to help support prices.", "description": "There is enough oil in global stockpiles to replace barrels Saudi Arabia has temporary lost due to attacks on its oil facilities, Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak, an ally of Riyadh in a pact to curb supply, told reporters on Monday.", "authors": ["Vladimir Soldatkin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430376309&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F09T", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
