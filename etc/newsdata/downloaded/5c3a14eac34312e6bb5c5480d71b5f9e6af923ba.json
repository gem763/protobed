But Houston struggled to move the ball in the second half, lost two fumbles and didn\u2019t get in the end zone after halftime until King\u2019s 12-yard run with 2:21 left cut the lead to 31-24.\n\nBrandon Arconado had nine receptions for 115 yards and Max Borghi added 61 yards receiving and ran for a touchdown in the third quarter to help Washington State to the victory.\n\nHouston went for it on fourth-and-1 on its first drive of the second half and fumbled the snap. Washington State recovered and Borghi caught a 17-yard pass on the ensuing drive and tied it at 14-all with a 1-yard scoring run.\n\nGordon used a perfect throw to deposit the ball between two defenders to Dezmon Patmon for a 39-yard touchdown midway through the third to give Washington State its first lead of the game 21-14.\n\nKing looked to have scored on a 72-yard run late in the third quarter, but Jeremy Singleton was called for holding and it was brought back. Houston\u2019s drive stalled after that and the team had to punt.\n\nThere were about 11 minutes left when Houston got within 21-17 with a 42-yard field goal.\n\nAnother touchdown pass by Gordon, this one a 7-yard strike to Travell Harris, pushed Washington State\u2019s lead to 28-17 with about seven minutes remaining.\n\nHouston took a 7-0 lead midway through the second quarter when King capped a 15-play, 82-yard drive with a 13-yard TD pass to Marquez Stevenson.\n\nWashington State tied it up on the next drive when Easop Winston got in front of the defense to grab a 39-yard touchdown reception from Gordon.\n\nKing put Houston back on top 14-7 when he sneaked on from 1-yard out on the next drive. King has at least one TD pass and one scoring run in 14 straight games to tie the FBS record for consecutive games with a TD run and passing touchdown set by Tim Tebow.\n\nWashington State put together a nice drive after that, but Gleson Sprewell made an acrobatic interception in the end zone to allow Houston to keep the lead heading into halftime. The play extended Houston\u2019s streak of games with a takeaway to 20, which is the longest active streak in the nation. It was also Houston\u2019s 103rd interception since 2013, which is the most in the country in that span.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nThese teams combined for 209 yards of penalties on Friday night, something they\u2019ll need to clean up before the two schools open conference play next week.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWashington State: Opens Pac-12 Conference play against UCLA next Saturday.\n\nHouston: Visits Tulane on Thursday in its American Athletic Conference opener.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nWashington State should maintain its spot in the poll after taking care of business against unranked Houston.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Anthony Gordon threw for 440 yards and three touchdowns for his third straight 400-yard game as No. 20 Washington State pulled away in the second half to get a 31-24 win over Houston on Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/washington_st_houston_football_63224_c0-241-3093-2044_s1770x1032.jpg?417884d3471eee3bab662e519e8a4cd39f37aad6", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
