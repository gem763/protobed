Bloomberg notes, for instance, that was the third-worst public debut of the last decade.\n\nThis price action might indicate that investors aren't excited about Peloton's prospects and that the struggles of consumer tech IPOs this year will continue. Some may also ask if this means the IPO window is closing. Have the struggles at The We Company spread into other offerings? And if the whole market of a successful IPO is seeing shares pop on the first day, then surely this is a failure, right?\n\nWell, as far as famed VC investor Bill Gurley sees it, the first-day IPO pop is the most misunderstood and financially nonsensical event that a management \u2014 and investors and the media \u2014 team could root for.\n\nSpeaking with Patrick O'Shaugnessy on the Invest Like the Best podcast this week, Gurley took to task the idea that \"successful\" IPOs are ones in which a company\u2019s stock trades sharply higher on the first day of trading.\n\n\"Thinking that a pop is a marketing event is about the most short-term oriented decision a manager or CEO/CFO could think,\" Gurley said. \"Because it happens and it's over. And then the rest of your corporate life is based on how the company performs. And the notion that I'd get some lasting benefit by paying $500 million for this marketing event flies in the face of long term thinking.\"\n\nGurley cites an analogy about homebuying he heard from Henry Blodget \u2014 imagine selling your house and then hearing your broker sold the home for 80% more the next day. Now imagine celebrating that. This is what is happening when first-day IPO pops are cheered. It is a celebration that makes no economic sense.\n\nCompanies that see shares pop on the first day of trading leave money on the table. Money that could've been used to invest in the business. And the founders, employees, and early investors in a company that sell shares into the IPO also lose money \u2014 potentially hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 if the stock goes nuts on the first day of trading. The only stakeholders excited about a first-day IPO pop are the investors who were fortunate enough to get an allocation the day before the IPO and then flipped these shares and the bankers who will now be able to earn fees on a future secondary offering of stock.\n\nTo take a real world example from this year, anyone that sold Beyond Meat (BYND) shares into the IPO sold shares at $25; when the market closed on Beyond's first day of trading, those shares were worth $65.75. So a Beyond Meat executive, for example, that sold $1 million worth of Beyond Meat stock into the IPO lost out on more than $1.6 million in potential gains.\n\nPeloton IPO (Reuters) More\n\nBut guess who did benefit? The investors who got an IPO allocation of Beyond and flipped it on day one and the bankers that got to participate in Beyond's secondary offering in late July.\n\nIn other words, the winner of Beyond Meat's IPO wasn't Beyond Meat.\n\nNow, certainly the bankers that run IPO processes don't do nothing. You cannot have well-paid, well-connected finance professionals market your company and connect with investors for free. And as with many things in financial markets, the psychology of events can matter as much as the economics of an event. So if the psychology of an IPO that sinks on its first day of trading is thought to indicate that the company's prospects are bad, then the economic benefit for a company that prices its IPO higher than where it opens for trade might be ignored by investors.", "description": "Top news and what to watch in the markets on Friday, September 27, 2019.", "authors": ["Myles Udland", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ycMuJrmodFsolkHuvmeebg--~B/aD0xNDQyO3c9MjE5NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3deb3b10-e0a6-11e9-baf5-37fdb5e0f19a", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
