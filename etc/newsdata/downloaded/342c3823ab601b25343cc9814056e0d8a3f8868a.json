No doubt that the Nifty Pharma looks to be the weakest point of , showing persistence in a downward trend since September 2018; despite a bout of bouncing moves shown by Nifty 50 during this period when the Nifty 50 touched its recent peak at 12,185 on July 5th, 2019 before tumbling downward.\n\nNo doubt that the Pharma used to be one of the favorite sectors for Indian investors till April 6th, 2015, when Nifty Pharma touched its life-time peak at 14,050, but since then after following a consolidation phase till September 10th, 2018, amid a range from 8080 \u2013 12051, started to follow downward trend till October 7th, 2019; after witnessing a steep fall on a daily basis.\n\nI find that the growing damaging impact of economic slowdown at a global level has impacted this sector of the Indian equity markets up to the worst extent, besides other sectors due to export-interruptions, etc. No doubt that the Pharma is still showing more weakness due to weak signals in the weekly chart; as its current position below \u2018Ichimoku Cloud\u2019 and the formation of three outside bearish candles in a weekly chart; makes the situation worse.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFinally, I conclude that since the has also started to feel the growing bearishness of Nifty Pharma over its movements during the last few trading sessions; but further sell-off in Nifty Pharma will drag down Nifty 50 into more negative territory. Secondly, the growing fear of hurdles in Sino-U.S. Tariff talks on October 11 -12 in Washington. But, I find that if the tariff trade tussle between the two major economies of the world is resolved successfully, Nifty Pharma would be the topmost sector of Nifty 50 to attract investors\u2019 attention. I find that the Nifty Pharma will become the investors\u2019 hub in 2020 \u2013 2021. No doubt, that some of the constituents of are still showing their strength, which makes them next investment jewels during 2020 - 2021.
