So far that strength has more or less held up especially against the European currencies which are suffering their own woes.\n\nIn the UK PM Johnson appeared unrepentant after suffering defeat in the Supreme Court and continued to barrel towards a no-deal Brexit. The unapologetic stance has soured market sentiment and cable was inching towards breaking key support at the 1.2300 level. The market continues to believe that some sort of Brexit deal will get done \u2013 or at very least another extension will be granted, but unless Mr. Johnson is compelled to ask for an extension UK may well crash out of EU with no deal. For now, the risks of such a scenario still look small but today\u2019s trading action in the pound shows that part of the market is becoming increasingly alarmed.\n\nThe too was sliding into oblivion for most of the night as it approached recent multi-year lows at 1.0925. With no news on the docket, the move was more technical than fundamental as shorts looked ready to run the 1.0900 barrier in the absence of any action by the Germans take up fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe day ahead is full of central bank speak with , , , and all scheduled to speak. Given their stances, there is little in the rhetoric that would surprise the market, but if the US monetary policy officials sound a dovish note, some of the dollar rally could reverse as the day proceeds.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Boris Schlossberg covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, DAX, Nikkei 225.
