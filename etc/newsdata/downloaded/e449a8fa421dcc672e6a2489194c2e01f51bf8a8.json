REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nHowever, tensions in the Middle East are still running high, and things are not quite back to normal yet. Bond yields are flat to lower on the day and stock markets in Europe are opening lower after a similarly weak session in Japan.\n\nU.S. futures are also lower before an event-packed day. The Federal Reserve will almost certainly announce a quarter-point rate cut at 1800 GMT. But what markets really want to see is whether it's a hawkish cut or a dovish one. Will the Fed signal it is embarking on a cycle of sharp rate cuts, or is it going to proceed on a data-by-data basis?\n\nThe latter may disappoint markets, which have already scaled back the likelihood of a 25-basis-point cut today to 65%; a week back it was all but baked in, according to CME Group\u2019s Fedwatch tool. U.S. industrial production for August released yesterday was better than expected, suggesting the U.S. economy isn\u2019t in dire shape by any means.\n\nBut Fed policy has come more into focus after this week\u2019s sudden leap in U.S. funding costs. The overnight repo rate rose as high as 10%, forcing the New York Fed to do a $75 billion repo auction, its first in over a decade. The clear signs of stress may prompt the Fed to resume its balance sheet expansion. The funding rates are back at zero, but another repo auction is due later today.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields are lower today, off Friday\u2019s 1.908%, the highest in a month and a half. The dollar remains strong, near a seven-week high versus the yen, and a hawkish Fed cut push it higher. Among other central banks, Indonesia\u2019s is expected to cut rates later in the day, continuing the story of rate cuts across emerging markets.\n\nSafe-haven asset prices, while off recent highs, continue to be underpinned by events in the Middle East. A U.S. official told Reuters the weekend attacks on Saudi oil operations had originated in southwestern Iran.\n\nIsrael\u2019s election may be inconclusive, suggesting the end of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s decade in power. Israeli stocks were down but the shekel remained unchanged.\n\nIn the UK, the Supreme Court continues its hearing today on the legality of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of parliament. Sterling gained yesterday towards $1.25 as investors trimmed short positions on the pound, after Johnson\u2019s lawyer told the court that he could recall parliament earlier than scheduled if the court rules against him.\n\nStocks in Europe have opened weaker before the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision. In corporate news, FedEx\u2019s (FDX.N) profit warning overnight citing trade war is likely to cast a shadow on European logistics companies. FedEx shares tumbled 10% in U.S. extended trading. Its European rival Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE) is sliding 3.2% in early Frankfurt trade. DSV (DSV.CO), Kuehne & Nagel (KNIN.S), Royal Mail (RMG.L), PostNL (PTNL.AS) and other European mail-delivery companies are also expected to come under pressure.\n\nApple (AAPL.O) component suppliers could rally following their Asian peers as news on strong pre-orders for the latest iteration of iPhone. AMS (AMS.S), STMicro (STM.PA), Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and Dialog Semi (DLGS.DE) are some names to watch out for.\n\nLuxury stocks, mainly Swatch (UHR.S) and Richemont (CFR.S), are expected to slide after a bearish note by UBS. Moncler (MONC.MI) is seen sliding 2% after its CEO said he is cautious on sales due to Hong Kong unrest.\n\nItalian toll road operator Atlantia\u2019s (ATL.MI) CEO resigned as the company moved to deal with the fallout from a deadly bridge collapse last year.\n\nIn the UK, Cobham shares are seen opening 3%-5% lower as the UK CMA\u2019s intervention in Advent\u2019s merger proposal raises worries of possible rejection. Traders called B&Q owner Kingfisher (KGF.L) shares -2% after weak sales and a cautious outlook.\n\nEmerging-market stocks were up 0.3%, with Chinese stocks up a similar amount on expectations of lower borrowing costs at home and in the United States, with improving trade relations between Beijing and Washington aiding risk appetite.\n\nMSCI\u2019s emerging market currency index is back in positive territory, with Turkey\u2019s lira up 0.3% after a Turkish regulator on Tuesday ordered banks to write off $8.1 billion of loans by year\u2019s end and set aside loss reserves in one of the clearest signs of efforts to clean up its economy. South Africa\u2019s rand is up ahead of the release on Wednesday of August inflation and retail sales data.\n\nThe Taiwanese dollar, Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht are among emerging Asian currencies leading gains against the dollar.\n\n\u2014 A look at the day ahead from EMEA deputy markets editor Sujata Rao.
