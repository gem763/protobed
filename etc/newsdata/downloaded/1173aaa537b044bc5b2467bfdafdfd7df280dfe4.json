The team felt so confident it could stymie Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens offense Sunday that the Steelers actually deferred after winning the coin toss in overtime.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat put a lot of pressure on the Steelers\u2019 defense. If Jackson and the Ravens scored a touchdown on the opening drive in overtime, they would win the game.\n\nWhile many questioned the Steelers\u2019 decision, it paid off ... initially. The team forced the Ravens to punt after three plays in overtime. That meant the Steelers just needed to score to win.\n\nMike Tomlin trusted his defense against Lamar Jackson. (AP Photo/Tom E. Puskar)\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen. On the team\u2019s second play in overtime, JuJu Smith-Schuster lost a fumble. Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey recovered the fumble, setting the Ravens up in excellent field-goal position.\n\nAfter three running plays, the Ravens lined up for the winning kick. Justin Tucker delivered, making it from 46 yards out. The Ravens won 26-23.\n\nThe Steelers\u2019 decision to let Jackson try to beat them speaks volumes about how they feel about the Baltimore offense. Jackson has been a breakout player early in the season, but was held in check Sunday. Jackson completed 19 passes for just 161 yards. He threw one touchdown and was picked off by the Steelers three times.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s also possible the Steelers deferred because they couldn\u2019t trust their offense. Mason Rudolph left the contest after he was knocked out cold after a brutal hit. The Steelers turned to undrafted rookie Devlin Hodges with Rudolph and Ben Roethlisberger sidelined.\n\nFollowing the contest, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin explained his decision, saying it was all about special teams.\n\nTomlin on kick off to in OT: \"Man, did you see our kickoff return in this football game? Did you see their kickoff team? Every time they put the ball on about the 2-yard line and Tucker hung the ball at about 4.5 secs, we couldn't get back to the 15. Why would I sign up for that? \u2014 Mark Kaboly (@MarkKaboly) October 6, 2019\n\nThe Steelers lost, but other teams might benefit. Pittsburgh may have created the blueprint on how to defend Jackson. The Ravens may have walked away from this game with a victory, but the team has work to do on offense.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
