How U.S. officials handle these could further affect a global economy that\u2019s already being dented by U.S. trade policy.\n\nDeadlines are piling up. In the nearly three years of Trump\u2019s presidency, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office has rolled out punitive tariffs and shredded long-standing agreements, recalibrating its trading relationships with every one of its top 10 trading partners, based on goods-alone data from 2018.\n\nThis war on every front means the USTR hasn\u2019t been able to focus all its resources on the most severe issue - reining in China\u2019s unfair trade practices, some trade experts say.\n\n\u201cSignificant problems with international trade have been festering for a long time and it\u2019s true that the U.S. needed to break something,\u201d said Clete Willems, a partner with law firm Akin Gump and former Trump economic advisor.\n\n\u201cHowever, we didn\u2019t need to break it all at the same time and could have been more focused on China from the start,\u201d he added.\n\nHere is a rundown:\n\nOCTOBER 18 - EU TARIFFS\n\nAs soon as Oct. 18, the United States could start taxing European goods including Provolone cheese and Scotch whisky by 25%, after the World Trade Organization ruled it has the right to tax some $7.5 billion in goods.\n\nUnder the measures Airbus planes assembled in Europe will also be hit with a tariff of 10%, putting pressure on the European planemaker to absorb at least part of the cost rather than see deals canceled, industry sources said.\n\nExpect the EU to retaliate, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said earlier this month. \u201cIf the American administration rejects the hand that has been held out by France and the European Union, we are preparing ourselves to react with sanctions,\u201d he said..\n\nNOVEMBER 14 - AUTOS 232\n\nA long-running U.S. investigation into whether imported cars and auto parts pose a national security threat comes to a head on Nov. 14.\n\nThat\u2019s the deadline for the Trump administration to decide whether to impose delayed \u201cSection 232\u201d national security tariffs of as much as 25% on foreign-made vehicles and parts.\n\nThe industry says these tariffs would add thousands of dollars to vehicle costs and potentially lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses throughout the U.S. economy.\n\nNOVEMBER 16/17 APEC SUMMIT\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Santiago, Chile, and Trump has suggested they could sign a \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade deal there. But the two sides still need to negotiate a text that puts into writing their understandings on intellectual property, currency policy, financial services access in China and agricultural purchases.\n\nThis would require intensive negotiations over the next month to try to finalize a text that may include additional actions on the U.S. side to ease tariffs, or more specific purchase commitments by China.\n\nNOVEMBER USMCA VOTE\n\nNegotiations for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which replaces NAFTA, resetting the rules between the United States and its neighbors to the north and south ended in September of 2018. But the U.S. Congress has yet to approve the deal, a requirement for it to go into effect.\n\nTrump, his administration, congressional Republicans and several key business groups have been pressuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take up the measure well before the Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 28. At the end of November, the bill will compete with a \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d budget measure to keep the government funded and running. And after that, the bill could be stuck in legislative limbo as the 2020 U.S. presidential and congressional election campaigns begin to heat up, and an impeachment investigation moves through the House.\n\nHowever, some Democrats and the head of the AFL-CIO labor union have recently expressed concerns about how labor terms will be enforced. \u201cIf there was a vote on the new #NAFTA before Thanksgiving, the agreement would be defeated,\u201d the labor union chief said Oct. 9.\n\nDECEMBER 15 NEW CHINA TARIFFS\n\nNew tariffs on $156 billion in Chinese goods that have previously escaped the trade war go into effect Dec. 15.\n\nThese imports are almost all consumer goods, including cellphones, laptop and table computers, toys and clothing. The deadline was set to allow U.S. firms and retailers to bring in sufficient inventories for the Christmas selling season tariff free, but they could prompt price hikes for last-minute shoppers.", "description": "Trade talks between the United States and China ended last week on a mostly uncertain note, but one thing was clear - the White House canceled a scheduled tariff hike on $250 billion in Chinese goods that would have gone into effect on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Heather Timmons", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441085927&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0Y2", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
