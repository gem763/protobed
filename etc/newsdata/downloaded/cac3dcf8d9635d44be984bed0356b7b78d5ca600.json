In May, fire officials determined that PG&E equipment caused Camp Fire in November 2018, the most destructive forest fire in the state\u2019s history that killed 85 people, burned nearly 14,000 homes and razed more than 150,000 acres of land.\n\nSumeet Singh, vice president of PG&E\u2019s Community Wildlife Safety Program, said during a media conference in San Fransico that upwards of 800,00 people throughout portions of 34 northern, central and coastal counties would lose power during the shutoff.\n\nHe said peak winds are to start Wednesday morning and continue until Thursday.\n\nSonoma County issued a Red Flag Warning that PG&E was conducting an \u201cimminent power shutoff.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may lose power starting at midnight tonight,\u201d the statement said. \u201cA prolonged outage may reduce our ability to warn you in the event of an emergency. Remain aware of your surroundings and be prepared to evacuate if you feel in danger.\u201d\n\nSonoma County Superintended told the Los Angeles Times that its a \u201cblunt\u201d approach but at the same time \u201cthere\u2019s an understanding of why it\u2019s being undertaken.\u201d\n\nPG&E said communities not forecast to experience extreme weather may have their power cut as the electric system relies on power lines that work together.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our customers and the communities we serve is our most important responsibility, which is why PG&E has decided to turn power off to customers during this widespread, severe wind event,\u201d PG&E\u2019s Senior Vice President of Electric Operations Michael Lewis said in a statement. \u201cWe understand the effects this event will have on our customers and appreciate the public\u2019s patience as we do what is necessary to keep our communities safe and reduce the risk of wildfire.\u201d\n\nWhile the company has received much criticism from the public over its third power shut off in the last two months, Gov. Gavin Newsom defended the company, saying the shutoff was in the public\u2019s best interest.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we want to protect people,\u201d he said Tuesday in Oakland for a bill signing event. \u201cWe want to make sure people are safe. This is what PG&E thinks is in the best interest of their customers and ultimately for this region and the state.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 California\u2019s largest utility Pacific Gas & Electric said early Wednesday that it will begin to shut off power to portions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
