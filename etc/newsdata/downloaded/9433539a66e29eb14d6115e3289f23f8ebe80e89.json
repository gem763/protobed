The additional 1 percentage-point reduction will be carried out in two cuts slated for Oct. 15 and Nov. 15, and is expected to account for about 100 billion yuan of the projected overall impact, the central bank said. The central bank reiterated that the actions don\u2019t amount to a change in its policy stance and that it would stick to a prudent monetary policy, rather than flood the financial system with cash. The last time the central bank announced an overall cut in the reserve requirement ratio was in January, when it freed up 800 billion yuan with a 1 percentage-point reduction. \u2014Lin Zhu\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
