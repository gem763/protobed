Well, it kind of is.\n\nBut underneath the veil of glamour and frivolity lies a very real and economic purpose: to showcase the latest contributions to a $385.7bn (\u00a3298bn) global industry.\n\nLasting four weeks, fashion month sees designers from around the world debut their latest collections in New York, London, Milan and Paris.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nEach city has its own distinct identity and aesthetic. Where some uphold the establishment, such as Chanel and Louis Vuitton, whose collections have been showing in Paris for decades, others champion emerging talents, think Central Saint Martins graduate Matty Bovan, who now shows in London.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about fashion month, from who attends and why it matters to what each of the cities are known for.\n\nWhat is fashion month?\n\nFashion month is a four-week period that happens twice a year in February and September, during which designers showcase their collections for the season ahead.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

New York Fashion Week SS20: Best street style 1/13 Just because the September skies are grey, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to dress to match, as this guest demonstrated at NYFW. The stylish showgoer opted for a pair of white high-waisted jeans worn with matching trainers, a boxy yellow T-shirt and black YSL crossbody bag. Getty Images 2/13 This guest embraced the spirit of the Nineties with her ensemble that consisted of pinstripe cycling shorts, a band T-shirt, baggy denim overshirt white socks and trainers combo. The street styler finished her look by wearing her hair in a super-high pony tail. Getty Images 3/13 If you\u2019re going to attend one of the most coveted fashion events of the year, you might as well make a strong impression while doing so. That\u2019s exactly what this guest did, turning up in a checked mini dress that featured a Victoriana-inspired ruffled neck and sleeves. Getty Images 4/13 Paired with a striking yellow head scarf, Louis Vuitton bag and flat sandals, this fashionista looked every inch a style queen in her striped midi dress. Getty Images 5/13 Dapper Dan opted for head-to-toe Gucci for the first day of shows at New York Fashion Week. The fashion designer wore a navy blazer, dress shirt and checked bow tie with burgundy trousers and matching brogues. He completed the look with a pair of oversized black-and-green sunglasses. Getty Images 6/13 This guest embodies the spirit of \u201coff-duty model\u201d style, wearing a black-and-white crop top, mini skirt and biker boots. Getty Images 7/13 This guest displayed the power of vintage styling with her NYFW look, opting for a pair of blue denim jeans worn with a graphic shirt, white socks and tan-coloured shoes. Getty Images 8/13 Leopard print is continuing to reign supreme in the fashion world. This guest donned a printed shirt with pinstripe trousers and brown loafers. Getty Images 9/13 This street style offset a pair of printed wide-leg trousers with a navy tailored jacket, nude sandals and over-the-shoulder bag. Getty Images 10/13 This guest made a bold statement on the streets of New York in a python print two-piece. She was accompanied by a friend wearing a modish tailored jacket with capri pants and kitten heels. Getty Images 11/13 Neutral tones show no sign of going out of fashion and this is a sentiment clearly shared by this fashion expert. The guest paired a midi-length python-print skirt with tan-coloured boots and a cream bodysuit. Getty Images 12/13 Dressing in one colour simply never goes out of fashion when it\u2019s done right. This guest proved just how to pull off a look that lacks colour, wearing white denim jeans with a matching vest top and studded belt. Getty Images 13/13 More is more when it comes to leopard, one of the most dynamic prints set to dominate in the season ahead. Paired here with black sunglasses and a pink bucket bag, there's no stopping this savvy street styler.

In London, for example, there's London Fashion Week Festival, which is organised by the British Fashion Council and takes place immediately after fashion week.\n\nCatwalks, talks with industry insiders and exclusive shopping events are on offer, giving fashion fans an insight into what fashion week is all about.\n\nNew York Fashion Week\n\nThis year, New York Fashion Week begins on Friday 6 September.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Calvin Klein, usually one of the most highly anticipated shows, staged its final runway show last year, and Derek Lam, who announced the closure of his main line in July.\n\nShows take place all around the city, but there is a central hub in Soho where there are regular shows happening throughout the week.\n\nLondon Fashion Week\n\nLondon Fashion Week commences on Thursday 12 September.\n\nOver the years, the event has become defined by its juxtaposition of established brands (Burberry, Roksanda, Erdem) and up-and-coming names (Matty Bovan, Halpern, Richard Quinn).\n\nThe majority of events used to take place at Somerset House, but LFW\u2019s home has moved down the road to 180 Strand.\n\nThough, like with New York, designers often choose to host their shows in various locations across the capital, leaving the hub a space reserved for hosting designer showrooms and a number of low-key shows.\n\nMilan Fashion Week\n\nMilan offers some of the most elaborate and entertaining fashion shows around, with designers like Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, Versace and Prada putting all the stops out to contextualise their weird and wonderful sartorial visions.\n\nIt attracts a high calibre of spectators too, with recent attendees including Cate Blanchett, Julianne Moore and Cindy Crawford.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

REUTERS 7/20 Black and yellow might be a colour combination reserved for bumblebee costumes, but that's not to say it can't work wonders on a fur jacket worn with leather trousers and black biker boots. REUTERS 8/20 Fuchsia and red should be worn together more often. Bright, optimistic and eye-catching, these hues bring out the best in one another here.

Paired with gold stiletto heels and opulent drop earrings, it's even more of an unconventional choice, but one that works against all odds.
