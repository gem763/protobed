UPDATE 3-TC Energy reports spill in North Dakota, shuts Keystone pipeline\n\n(Adds comment from emergency manager)\n\nBy K. Sathya Narayanan and Rod Nickel\n\nOct 30 (Reuters) - TC Energy Corp said on Wednesday it was shutting its Keystone crude pipeline after a late Tuesday oil spill in North Dakota.\n\nThe company detected a drop in pressure on Tuesday night on its 590,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Keystone oil pipeline system from Canada, it said in a statement, without specifying the exact impact on operations.\n\n\"TC Energy immediately began the process to shut down the pipeline, activated its emergency response procedures and dispatched ground technicians to assess the situation,\" the company said. It did not say if the entire route of the line was closed, or just a section of the pipe.\n\nIt was unclear how much had leaked in the incident, which took place about three miles (5 km) northwest of Edinburg, in Walsh County, North Dakota.\n\nPipeline repair and cleanup might take two or three months, said Nelson, an emergency response manager for Walsh County.\n\nThe company was taking steps to prevent the oil from spreading, Nelson said by phone.\n\nThe North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality was overseeing the cleanup and investigation of the spill, said Karl Rockeman, director of the department's division of water quality.\n\nCleanup work was underway near the company's facilities in Edinburg, and roads were closed in the area, TC Energy said.\n\nThe pipeline system is a key transporter of Canadian crude from northern Alberta to refineries in the U.S. Midwest.\n\nCanada heavy crude differentials widened slightly on the news, according to Net Energy Exchange. Volumes, however, were thin as the market is outside the monthly Canadian crude trading window.\n\nWestern Canada Select (WCS) heavy blend crude for November delivery last traded at $17.15 per barrel below U.S. oil futures, widening from $17.05 per barrel below WTI on Tuesday. December WCS last traded at $16.95 a barrel under, widening from Tuesday's settle of $16.75 a barrel below WTI.\n\nIn the U.S. market, the November/December WTI cash roll, which allows traders to roll contracts to the next month, firmed on the outage, traders said.", "description": "UPDATE 3-TC Energy reports spill in North Dakota, shuts Keystone pipeline", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/999e9d554a53b39c7e910f2945582ab5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
