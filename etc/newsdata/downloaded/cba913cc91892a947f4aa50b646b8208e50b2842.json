If you\u2019re moving from your home in Wisconsin to a new life in New Mexico, you might struggle to find people willing to help you lug your bed, sofa and 17 puppies across the country \u2013 but if you\u2019re San Francisco-bound from a studio in Brooklyn, people will fall over themselves to offer you business.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It was tongue-in-cheek, but it also drew attention to what irks west-coasters the most: New Yorkers like to claim they\u2019re at the centre of the foodie universe and that their cultural output is indisputably higher than glitzy, ditzy LA \u2013 but not everyone is buying it.\n\nShivering New Yorkers swear over picklebacks in dive bars that they\u2019ll never endure another east coast winter again so they\u2019re decamping to the sunny, palm-lined west coast\n\nAsk an NYC resident why they\u2019d never up sticks and move to the beaches of California, and they\u2019ll tell you they just couldn\u2019t face the traffic jams. Los Angeles is known for being a city where everyone has a car \u2013 unlike New York, the sidewalks are not pedestrian-friendly and you can\u2019t fill your whole night by hopping between bars and restaurants which are all within a block or two of each other \u2013 and the resultant rush hour traffic jams are downright notorious.\n\nAngry Californians will counter that New York\u2019s subway system isn\u2019t exactly a dream either. The underground trains might run 24 hours, but they have a nasty habit of suddenly diverting themselves: \u201cThis Q is now an N train,\u201d the driver might say rapidly and incoherently while you still have your earphones in, and that\u2019s if you\u2019re lucky. Most of the time you\u2019ll just find out when you pull in to the next station and realise you\u2019re inexplicably in Queens. (If you\u2019ve spent time living and working in London, however \u2013 especially if you\u2019ve ever been a regular user of the Central line \u2013 you still find yourself unendingly grateful for those air-conditioned New York carriages, where there\u2019s standing room for everyone rather than crouching room only for those more than 6ft tall.)\n\nLike all good rivalries, the NYC-LA one is born out of familiarity and grudging love \u2013 the most common flight route in the US is the one between New York and Los Angeles, and when asked, New Yorkers will admit that the only other place they\u2019d live is California. \u201cI\u2019ll probably stay in New York my whole life,\u201d one friend said recently, \u201cor maybe go direct to LA. I\u2019d rather do that than visit real America.\u201d Like the phrase attributed to George Bernard Shaw which states that the English and Americans are two nations divided by a common language, New York and Los Angeles are two cities united by a common nation \u2013 and specifically united by the fact that neither of them likes that nation very much.", "description": "There\u2019s an advert on the New York City\u00a0subway showing two dinosaurs talking to each other over the top of the skyline (no, I don\u2019t know why either).\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m thinking of moving to LA,\u201d says one, his scaly head poking out from beyond the Empire State Building. \u201cYou\u2019re dead to me,\u201d replies the other, curling a claw around the top of an apartment block.", "authors": ["Holly Baxter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/12/istock-967425666.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
