But Epstein\u2019s closest pal appears not to have been a prominent politician or top academic, but a sleazy, scandal-prone modeling agent with virtually limitless connections to young women around the world.\n\nJean-Luc Brunel, 72, is the former head of Karin Models and Mc2\u2014two well-regarded international modeling agencies that launched the careers of cover girls like Ginta Lapina, Juana Burga and Sessilee Lopez. He has also been accused by former models of drugging and date-raping them, and by former employees of recruiting foreign, underage girls to be pimped out of Epstein\u2019s New York apartments.\n\nBrunel and his attorney did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. The modeling agent has previously denied any sexual misconduct or involvement in Epstein\u2019s crimes.\n\n\u201cI strongly deny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager,\u201d Brunel said in a 2015 statement, adding: \u201cI have exercised with the utmost ethical standard for almost 40 years.\"\n\nFor years prior to Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide this month, Brunel was one of the financier\u2019s most frequent male associates. The agent appears more than 15 times on flight logs from Epstein\u2019s private plane, jetting everywhere from Paris to New York, often in the presence of young women. He visited Epstein nearly 70 times in jail, according to visitor logs, and several more times while the financier was on house arrest in Palm Beach. According to one of Epstein\u2019s housemen, Brunel was comfortable enough to whip up his own meals in the financier\u2019s kitchen, and was one of Epstein\u2019s most frequent callers.\n\nA trove of documents unsealed this month revealed several messages Brunel left for Epstein over the years, dutifully recorded by the financier's employees and later recovered by investigators. In one message, the notetaker reported that Brunel \u201cjust did a good one\u201418 years,\u201d who reportedly told him, \u201c\u2018I love Jeffrey.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian,\u201d reads another note, dated September 2005. \u201cShe is 2 X 8 [16] years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have 1st today if you call.\u201d\n\nWhile it is unclear how they met, Brunel and Epstein were friends since at least the launch of Mc2 in 2005, according to legal documents. In fact, Epstein and Mc2 were so closely associated that one insider referred to the financier as the silent \u201cE\u201d in the agency\u2019s equation. (For those who failed high-school science, E = mc\u00b2 is the formula underpinning Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.)\n\nRepresentatives for Epstein and Mc2 have long denied having any business relationship. But Brunel admitted in court documents that Epstein once extended him a $1 million letter of credit, which the agent used to invest in a new venture with Elite Models in Paris. The venture, E Management, was first registered by Epstein\u2019s attorney, who listed its address as 457 Madison Avenue\u2014the same as Epstein\u2019s investment firm, J. Epstein & Co.\n\nAccording to Brunel, the venture fell apart after Elite Models learned of the sex-trafficking allegations against Epstein. The modeling agent even sued Epstein in 2015, claiming the allegations had tarnished his agency\u2019s reputation and caused him a \u201ctremendous loss of business.\u201d But at least two people have claimed that Brunel not only knew about the trafficking\u2014he was an active participant.\n\nVirginia Roberts (now Giuffre)\u2014one of the first alleged victims to speak out against Epstein after he was granted a sweetheart plea deal\u2014claimed in legal filings that Brunel was one of many powerful men she was forced to sleep with in her years as Epstein\u2019s \u201csex slave.\u201d She also accused Brunel of using his agency to find foreign girls, obtain visas for them, and \u201cfarm them out to his friends, including Epstein.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of the girls came from poor countries or poor backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making good money,\u201d Giuffre said in a 2015 affidavit. \u201cJeffrey Epstein has told me that he has slept with over 1,000 of Brunel\u2019s girls, and everything that I have seen confirms this claim.\u201d\n\nDescribing an orgy she was allegedly forced to participate in on Epstein\u2019s private island, Giuffre added, \"My assumption was that Jean-Luc Brunel got the girls from Eastern Europe (as he procured many young foreign girls for Epstein). They were young and European looking and sounding.\"\n\n\u201c Jeffrey Epstein has told me that he has slept with over 1,000 of Brunel\u2019s girls, and everything that I have seen confirms this claim. \u201d \u2014 Accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre\n\nA former employee of MC2, Martiza Vasquez, also accused Brunel of similar misdeeds. Vasquez, who worked as a bookkeeper for the agency between 2003 to 2006, told the FBI that Brunel employed scouts to bring in teenage models from South America, Europe and the former Soviet Union. The most desirable of those teens were housed in Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side apartments and loaned out to wealthy clients for up to $100,000 a night, Vasquez alleged. If they refused to be \u201cmolested,\u201d she said, they would not be paid. (Brunel has denied these claims and says Vasquez was fired from his agency for embezzling company funds.)\n\nOver the years, several outlets reported that the FBI was investigating Brunel, but no charges ever emerged. In fact, the modelizer managed to avoid being deposed in a single civil suit against Epstein\u2014of which there were more than a dozen. In a lawsuit filed by Brad Edwards, an attorney for several Epstein accusers, the lawyer claimed Brunel skirted depositions by saying he was living in France, when he was in fact staying at Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach mansion.\n\nBrunel, in his 2015 suit, claimed Epstein had pressured him into skipping the depositions, and said he regretted missing the chance to clear his company's name. He also claimed to have lost millions of dollars in potential business due to the \u201cnotoriety and tremendous publicity surrounding Epstein\u2019s criminal charges\u201d\u2014charges he claimed to have nothing to do with. The suit included emails from several agents and talent scouts saying they could not work with Brunel because of the sexual misconduct allegations.\n\n\u201c Most of the women felt they had been raped. But they were afraid to report it to the police because Brunel would ruin their careers. \u201d\n\n\u201cI have decided to bring judicial proceedings in France and in the United States against allegations which cause considerable damage to me personally and to my models agencies,\u201d Brunel said in a statement at the time. \u201cI strongly deny having participated, neither directly nor indirectly, in the actions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being accused of.\u201d\n\nBut charges of sexual misconduct have followed Brunel since before he met Epstein. In Michael Gross\u2019 1995 book Model, several of Brunel\u2019s peers described him as a dangerous playboy known for preying on young women. Elite Models founder John Casablancas\u2014who himself has been accused of sexual misconduct\u2014told Gross that Brunel and his friends were known for roaming Paris nightclubs to \u201cinvite girls and put drugs in their drinks.\u201d\n\nIn Ian Halperin\u2019s Bad and Beautiful, one former Karin model accused Brunel and his friends of inviting more than a dozen models to a private party at one of their apartments, then forcing some of the young women to have sex with them. \u201cMost of the women felt they had been raped,\u201d the former model said. \u201cBut they were afraid to report it to the police because Brunel would ruin their careers.\u201d\n\nIn a 60 Minutes feature from 1988, several American models who worked with Brunel in Paris described a culture in which young models were plied with drugs and taken to parties with older men. At the parties, women said, they would be denied work if they declined the men\u2019s sexual advances. Two women in the feature accused Brunel of drugging them; one accused him of raping her while she was unconscious.\n\nAccording to Craig Pyes, one of the reporters on the piece, the story did not end there. Pyes said he spoke with three more women over the course of his six-month investigation who said they were drugged and raped by Brunel or his friends, but who did not feel comfortable coming forward on-air.\n\n\u201cMy sense, based upon the allegations, is that Jean-Luc was a predator, his group was a predator, and they used their tools of power and leverage to force sex from women who otherwise might not be willing to engage in it,\u201d Pyes told The Daily Beast.\n\nBrunel declined to be interviewed by 60 Minutes at the time, but later denied the allegations. Christy Turlington, a top model and close friend of Brunel\u2019s, later told Halperin she thought some of the stories were exaggerated. \u201cIn this business you never know who to believe,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c It seems that people knew that Jean-Luc Brunel was quote-unquote \u2018dating\u2019 underage girls, but nobody seemed to care or do anything about it. \u201d\n\nJust this week, New Zealand model Zo\u00eb Brock told French publication Liberation she briefly lived in Brunel\u2019s apartment at age 17, but left after he insisted they would \u201chave to sleep together eventually.\u201d (The allegations are similar to those Brock made in a 2017 Medium piece.)\n\nThysia Huisman, a Dutch model, claimed she wasn\u2019t so lucky: After initially resisting Brunel\u2019s advances, she said, the agent gave her a drink that made her feel dizzy, then brought her into his bedroom and assaulted her.\n\n\u201cI remember he was on me, I tried to push him away and the noise when he ripped my clothes,\u201d she told Liberation. \u201cThen it's the black hole. I woke up in bed. I was totally disoriented. I went to collect my belongings in the room where I slept and I went directly to the station to leave Paris.\u201d\n\nThe prior allegations seem not too have hampered Brunel's business too much: In recent years, Mc2 has counted major department stores like Nordstrom, Macy\u2019s and Saks Fifth Avenue as clients, according to a letter from Brunel's business partner first obtained by Bloomberg. A Nordstrom executive even wrote a letter expressing her \u201cfull and unqualified\u201d support of Brunel\u2019s visa application in 2014.\n\nSara Ziff, the founder of the advocacy organization Model Alliance, said behavior like Brunel's is often overlooked in the modeling industry.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, predatory behavior has been normalized and, in turn, even enabled by some modeling agents, who may lack the judgment or training to address or prevent these abuses from happening,\u201d Ziff told The Daily Beast.\n\nToday, however, Brunel's influence over his modeling empire appears to be diminishing. Mc2 announced in 2012 that Brunel would be moving to a scouting and consulting role for the company. On Friday, a spokesperson for Mc2 in New York told The Daily Beast that Brunel was \u201cbasically retired\u201d and living out of the country. Asked for specifics about Brunel\u2019s role, the spokesperson said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really have one.\u201d\n\nRuth Malka, who took over Karin Models from Brunel in the early 2000s, told Liberation she hadn\u2019t worked with him in years. Malka told the website she never witnessed any improper behavior on Brunel\u2019s part, but added, \u201cI'm shocked at everything I hear. It disgusts me.\u201d", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s closest friend, French model scout Jean-Luc Brunel, is accused of preying on underage girls and farming them out to Epstein and others.", "authors": ["Emily Shugerman", "Gender Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565989207/190816-emily-jean-luc-brunel-tease_mjsd4w", "published_at": "2019-08-17"}
