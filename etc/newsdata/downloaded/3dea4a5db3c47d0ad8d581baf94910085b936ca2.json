I really wanna be active for my kids.\" And so it triggers something,' the KKW beauty company founder explained.\n\nThe star said that she had to focus on being positive for the sake of her husband, Kanye West, and children - North, six, Saint, three, Chicago, 20 months, and Psalm, four months.\n\n\u2018No matter what's going on in your life, you can take that time to grieve for a second\u2026 and then figure out how to be positive about it because it's not going to change,\u2019 she said.\n\n'There's no point in being depressed and staying in that headspace, but I felt it for a minute.'\n\nThe NHS states that lupus \u2013 otherwise known as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) - is a long-term health condition causing inflammation to the joints, skin and other organs. While there is no cure for lupus, treatment includes anti-inflammatory medicines and steroid tablets, injects and creams.\n\nLady Gaga and Selena Gomez have previously spoken about their experience of living with lupus.\n\nKardashian West, who recently launched her SKIMS size-inclusive shapewear, said that she first began experiencing pain in her hands as a result of the inflammatory lupus disease.\n\n'Until I figured out what was really going on, I just needed to take a break from lifting the baby, and that was really hard for me,' she revealed.\n\n'My baby Chicago was, like, a big baby. She's not light. But I was really worried because I had my baby coming, my baby boy [Psalm], and I thought it would be hard for me.'\n\nThe reality star added that she is now on medication and that \u2018everything seems to be fine for right now.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m just rolling with it day by day,\u2019 she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\u2018I really wanna be active for my kids\u2019", "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YyTvNeA5OsHwXjl97CSbeQ--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9Mjg2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/967c72d7927a2f99db4a0b2922ef36e0", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
