But even if we change one name, now we have a voice,\u201d said Youssef, a 33-year-old who was spending his sixth straight night in the square.\n\nProtesters have defied army orders to clear the streets between midnight and 6:00am local time, occupying the square and multi-storey buildings there.\n\nLate Tuesday, security forces unleashed volleys of tear gas at crowds massing on a key bridge linking Tahrir to the Green Zone, which hosts government offices and foreign embassies.\n\nBut the crowds seemed unfazed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started fighting over who can kick back the tear gas canister first,\u201d Youssef joked.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Cycle of violence\u2019 \u2013\n\nRallies in Baghdad and across the south have swelled in recent days, defying curfews, threats of arrest and violence that has left more than 240 people dead and more than 8,000 wounded.\n\nThe first burst of protests starting October 1 left 157 people dead, mostly protesters in Baghdad.\n\nAt least 85 more have died in a second wave starting last Thursday, including at least one protester killed overnight in the Shiite holy city of Karbala, according to the Iraqi Human Rights Commission.\n\nThe Karbala violence has sparked condemnations from Amnesty International, who said \u201cexcessive and often lethal force\u201d was used against protesters \u201cin a reckless and utterly unlawful manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vicious cycle of violence must end,\u201d said the United Nations\u2019 top official in Iraq Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaer, urging a national dialogue to respond to protesters\u2019 demands.\n\nThus far, the government\u2019s reform proposals \u2014 hiring drives, anti-corruption campaigns and more social safety nets \u2014 have failed to appease the protesters.\n\nThe movement is leaderless and disorganised, but recently received a new push from Iraq\u2019s younger generation, with students and school children streaming onto the streets despite orders to return to class.\n\nTrade unions representing teachers, lawyers and dentists have all declared strikes lasting several days.\n\nAbout 60 percent of Iraq\u2019s 40-million population is under the age of 25.\n\nBut youth unemployment stands at 25 percent, while one in five live below the poverty line, despite the vast oil wealth of OPEC\u2019s second-largest crude producer.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want this government any more. We want a transitional government and constitutional change,\u201d another female protester said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a teacher, I have a salary, I have a house \u2014 but the young unemployed people are my brothers and relatives, too.\u201d\n\nbur/", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 The Iraqi government\u2019s two main sponsors agreed early Wednesday to drop their support for embattled premier Adel Abdel Mahdi,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/2fef0c_iraq-has-rocked-by-two-waves-anti-government-protests-start-month-left-240-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
