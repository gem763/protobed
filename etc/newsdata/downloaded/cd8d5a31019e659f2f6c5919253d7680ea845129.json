(Picture: Kerry Elsworth/Mercury Press)\n\n\u2018People have asked me \u201cwhat\u2019s a colostomy bag?\u201d \u2013 they have never seen one before or know how it\u2019s used.\n\n\u2018I decided I wanted to make a dress from them, and turn them into something beautiful.\n\n\u2018I got in touch with a company which sent me a load of them, but as I started talking more and more about it, people began donating their old colostomy bags that they don\u2019t use anymore.\n\n\u2018Every time I\u2019ve asked someone \u201cwhat do you think it\u2019s made of?\u2019 they guess tent material or recycled items, but when I tell them it\u2019s colostomy bags their jaws hit the floor, they can\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d love someone to wear it for their wedding, it\u2019s very unusual and I could alter it to meet someones particular wants or needs.\n\n\u2018When Natasha put it on it, she said it felt like it was her wedding all over again.\u2019\n\nFollowing six months of chemotherapy, Angela underwent surgery to have her colostomy bag removed for good in October 2015, but the impact it had on her life inspired her to use her degree in fashion design to bring about change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter attending the 2018 Lancaster Slow Fashion show, which celebrates recycled garments, the former textiles teacher decided to start collecting more than 100 of the medical pouches to create a ball gown for this year\u2019s show.\n\nAngela\u2019s daughter wore the dress (Picture: Kerry Elsworth/Mercury Press)\n\nDrawing up and stitching the entire dress by hand, it took Angela two hours a day for a week to work the difficult material into the gown she had envisaged by pinning varying sized bags onto a handmade satin corset and sewing them together.\n\nAt the event on Saturday 19 October, the dress was modelled by her daughter, Natasha, 30, but now the creative cancer survivor has even vowed to rent out the dress to help raise awareness, and hopes that a celebrity colostomy bag wearer may volunteer to give the garment another day out.\n\nAngela said: \u2018Making the dress took me much longer to make than I thought because they are quite a difficult material to work with.\n\n\u2018At one point I had pinned all the bags down and I took them over to the sewing machine and they all just started flying everywhere.\n\n\u2018After the show people were coming up and asking me if it was really made out of colostomy bags and asking if they could touch it, they were amazed by how beautiful it looked.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d love to see a celebrity come forward and admit they have had a colostomy bag and volunteer to wear the dress to help us raise awareness, it looks lovely on.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Angela has now been in remission for over four years, she says she still understands what other people with bowel cancer are going through, and wants to do anything she can to help.\n\nThe dress features over 100 bags (Picture: Kerry Elsworth/Mercury Press)\n\nAs well as renting out the dress, Angela now also offers seamstress advice to other colostomy bag wearers so that they can have their clothes adapted if they need to.\n\nAngela said: \u2018Before I was diagnosed, I kept going back to the doctor because I really didn\u2019t feel good and I asked if it could be bowel cancer because my mother had it, but they just kept saying I was too young.\n\n\u2018Eventually my family insisted that I go back and I pushed them to conduct a proper test, and I\u2019m glad I did because they told me I had stage three bowel cancer and only a few months later they were able to remove the whole tumour.\n\n\u2018I was fitted with a colostomy bag and I was so embarrassed. My mum had one but she had kept it very private.\n\n\u2018I used to live in my jeans and all of a sudden I couldn\u2019t wear them. I had to start altering my clothes just to make them fit again\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I had a few accidents with my colostomy bag so whenever you go out with friends or go shopping you\u2019re worried about it and you\u2019re thinking about where the nearest toilet is.\n\n\u2018You wonder whether you should go out and you totally lose your confidence.\n\n\u2018I was so relieved when they told me that they had successfully reversed my stoma, but I can still understand what people go through.\u2019\n\nMORE: Debenhams launches Gordon\u2019s pink gin advent calendar with strawberry chocolates\n\nMORE: There\u2019s a clitoral \u2018ghosting balm\u2019 to help you get over your MIA lovers\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A woman who beat bowel cancer and was given a colostomy has made an amazing wedding dress designed using colostomy bags.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92552963_1572094130.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
