(Getty)\n\nThis is starting to feel like a broken record.\n\nThere was a bad pass interference call in a prime-time NFL game.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nA coach challenged the call.\n\nThe bad call was upheld.\n\nPeople got mad.\n\nAnother controversy on \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019\n\nThe latest instance happened in Monday\u2019s game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe play in question involved a deep sideline ball from Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph to wideout Johnny Holton on first-and-10 from their own 35-yard line. The ball fell incomplete, and there was a flag on the play.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nOfficials called offensive pass interference on Holton as he was battling with Bengals cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick for the catch.\n\nClearly not PI\n\nHere\u2019s the play in question. Holton brushed Kirkpatrick\u2019s back with his left hand as both were running down the sideline. He then leapt to catch the ball on its descent, and the two made nominal contact ordinary of any pass play in the NFL.\n\nOffensive Pass Interference OPI called on Johnny Holton, upheld after Pittsburgh challenge #PITvsCIN #MNF #CINvsPIT pic.twitter.com/UrW4mpxgNj \u2014 Sports Gifs & Videos (@Supreme_gifs) October 1, 2019\n\nIt was most clearly not a case of pass interference on either side, an assessment that Steelers coach Mike Tomlin agreed with as he threw his red challenge flag.\n\nCall on field upheld\n\nStory continues\n\nNo matter. Whatever extraordinary bar for overturning a pass interference call exists under the new NFL rule, this play did not meet it. The ruling on the field was upheld without explanation from the officiating crew. First and 20, Steelers.\n\nPittsburgh ended up gaining a first down, but punted when the drive stalled near midfield.\n\nIt recalls a case from last week\u2019s Thursday night game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Green Bay Packers when officials missed and upheld a no-call upon review of a blatant instance of pass interference against the Eagles.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of the rule?\n\nGranted, these aren\u2019t the outrageous cases like last year\u2019s NFC championship game controversy that inspired this rule to begin with.\n\nNobody wants to see marginal calls overturned. And nobody wants to see coaches incentivized to challenge borderline plays, which appears to be the reasoning for the high replay bar.\n\nBut when people see plays that are so clearly called wrong on the field and upheld upon review, they get upset. And reasonably so.\n\nThey start to wonder. What exactly is the point of this new pass interference review process to begin with?\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Another bad pass interference ruling was upheld upon review, prompting questions about why the NFL has this rule in the first place.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pSvgJvJHLZ7b2BQSzzsClA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MTkuNDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3rbrAHiQuIbc.wDHHeTaZg--~B/aD0yMTU2O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8a708e10-e3ec-11e9-aef5-afd4dbc74a81", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
