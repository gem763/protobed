He also allegedly suggested targeting Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke.\n\nCelestino Arce/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAccording to charging documents in the case, Jarrett William Smith, who transferred to Fort Riley, Kansas, in July, joined the U.S. military only after first expressing his desire to fight in Ukraine.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2019, Smith allegedly spoke with an FBI informant in an online chat group and discussed a plan for an attack inside the U.S., his search for more \"radicals\" like himself, and the possibility of killing members of the group Antifa.\n\nIn suggesting that the headquarters of the major news network could be a target, Smith allegedly said: \"A large vehicle bomb. Fill a vehicle full of [explosives] then fill a ping pong ball with [commonly available chemical] via drilling then injection. Put the ball in the tank of the vehicle and leave. 30 minutes later, BOOM.\"\n\nThen, in a Telegram conversation with an undercover FBI agent on Sept. 20, Smith allegedly had this exchange:\n\nFBI: You got anyone down in Texas that would be a good fit for fire, destruction and death? SMITH: Outside of Beto? I don't know enough people that would be relevant enough to cause a change if they died.\n\nJoshua Lott/Getty Images\n\nSmith has allegedly been in communication with another American, Craig Lang, who traveled to Ukraine and fought with another far-right group, the Right Sector.\n\nThey were in contact since 2016. On Dec. 8, 2018, Smith allegedly led a group chat on Facebook with Lang that included discussing Smith's ability to build bombs.\n\nSmith allegedly said, \"Oh yeah, I got knowledge of IEDs for days. We can make cell phone IEDs in the style of the Afghans. I can teach you that.\"\n\nSmith was arrested on Sept. 21, and he allegedly admitted to the FBI that he provides people online with instructions for building bombs.\n\nAccording to charging documents, at least one of the instructions he allegedly provided in recent days would not have resulted in a viable explosive device.\n\nHe has been charged in Kansas with distributing information relating to weapons of mass destruction.", "description": "The FBI arrested an Army soldier who allegedly discussed plans to bomb a major American news network.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/fb1-02-as-gty-190820_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
