This is not, I would say, my strongest circuit.\n\n\"There\u2019s always areas you can improve,\" added the 34-year-old who has won four times at Suzuka and five in Japan overall, just one short of Michael Schumacher\u2019s record haul of six Japanese Grand Prix wins.\n\nGiven the second session\u2019s potential to decide the grid order, it assumed greater importance than usual.\n\nMax Verstappen went third fastest for Honda-powered Red Bull, making a strong start to the Japanese engine supplier\u2019s home weekend.\n\nThe Dutchman had been fourth in the morning but vaulted past Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel in the afternoon to push the Ferrari pair down to fourth and fifth.\n\nFerrari have been the team to beat since Formula One\u2019s August break, starting the last four races from pole and converting three of those to victory.\n\nBut they appeared to have fallen back slightly after their recent resurgence.\n\n\"We made the most out of our day, which was the most important, but it seems we are lacking pace this weekend,\" said Leclerc, 21.\n\nAlexander Albon was sixth for Red Bull ahead of McLaren\u2019s Carlos Sainz and Racing Point\u2019s Sergio Perez.\n\nFrenchman Pierre Gasly, who gave up his seat in the opening session so Naoki Yamamoto could drive his Honda-powered Toro Rosso in front of his home crowd, was ninth with McLaren\u2019s British rookie Lando Norris 10th.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford/Alan Baldwin/Toby Davis)", "description": "Valtteri Bottas led Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton in practice for the Japanese Grand Prix on Friday before Formula One battened down the hatches and awaited the arrival of typhoon Hagibis.
