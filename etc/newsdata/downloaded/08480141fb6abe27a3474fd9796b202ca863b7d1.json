Sometimes I ask my advice from close friends about how I cope with these sexual urges that emerge within you' he said.\n\n'I pray a lot so I feel, not comfortable but peaceful.'\n\nIn August Australia's child abuse royal commission called on the church to consider voluntary celibacy for clergymen.\n\nAustralian Catholic Bishops Conference president Archbishop Mark Coleridge acknowledged the idea had some merit, in theory, but it was unlikely to be implemented.\n\n'I suspect that on that question of mandatory celibacy, given its implications for the church in every place around the world, that there won't be much movement on that particular issue,' he said.\n\nThe only Australian trainee priest to speak to the publication, Samuel Pearson, 28, from Glenroy, Melbourne, said he found his path while at university.\n\nComing from a 'pretty ordinary Catholic family' he didn't realise the depth of his faith until he encountered 'militant Marxists and pugnacious progressives' who indulged in 'anti-Christian quips'.\n\n'I was confronted by many who were actively hostile to the values that unconsciously defined who I am. Anti-Christian quips in tutorials were common,' he said.\n\nHe said once he acknowledged his true Catholic roots he discovered his calling.\n\n'I was like a guy who just met the girl of his dreams and would smile goofily when he saw her!' he said.\n\nThe third trainee priest who spoke to the publication, Chathura Silva, 28, was born in Sri Lanka and decided to move to Australia when he was 24.\n\nHe said moving to Australia to train as a Catholic priest was a 'big prospect' but one he has taken on gladly.\n\nIt was a lonely experience at first but since settling in Silva has been enjoying his training time.", "description": "Young men training to become Catholic priests have opened up about the modern challenges they face in the midst of church scandals and mandatory celibacy.", "authors": ["Adam Mccleery For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/00/19639980-0-image-a-22_1570924351720.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
