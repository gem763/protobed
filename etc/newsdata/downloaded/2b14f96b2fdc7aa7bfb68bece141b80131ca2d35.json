Apparently, young people today are routinely talked down to by financial advisers, who rudely assume anyone under 40 is a debt-soaked avocado-toast-hoarding Instagram junkie who will never buy a home or a car.\n\nFine, OK. But I\u2019m also an unrepentant truth teller, and I need to give today\u2019s young people honest advice about their finances:\n\nStop Buying French Castles, Dammit!If I run into one more 20-something in the Journal offices who wants to regale me with their recent purchase of a ch\u00e2teau in Provence, I am going to scream. Kids today need to stop buying these things. I don\u2019t know why young people are obsessed with buying 16th-century Gallic castles, I don\u2019t know if the banks are getting goofy with loans, but you have to stop. Buy too many castles, and you\u2019re never going to be able to afford one of those starter New York City apartments, with a toilet in the kitchen.\n\nPrivate Jet Travel Only for Flights Over Eight Hours. Self explanatory. If you\u2019re under 30 and you\u2019re spending more than $14 million a year on air travel, that is going to start adding up fast.\n\nGeneration Z is the stuffed-animal generation. Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nEnough with the Stuffed Animals Maybe you didn\u2019t know this, but members of Generation Z are still crazy about their stuffed animals. Many of them traipse through the workplace with a large mesh satchel of \u201cstuffies\u201d (bunnies, kitties, dragons, unicorns) they have owned since childhood, and they keep adding to their collections. It\u2019s not unusual to meet a young person who owns more than $1.2 million in stuffies. Enough! Part of being a mature adult is wasting money on important things, like Springsteen tickets, and vacations in Tulum.\n\nCollege. For some reason, young people still insist on going to college, when there is nothing you can learn at Harvard or Stanford that you can\u2019t learn on YouTube in six minutes. It feels like a giant waste of money and time, and, thanks to the FBI, you can\u2019t even get to college by pretending you\u2019re a varsity rower anymore. Lame.\n\nNow is the time to stockpile Juul. Photo: Bloomberg\n\nStockpile Juul. Everyone under 50 vapes, it\u2019s just a fact. But the health science is worrisome, and the government is cracking down. That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be a prime investment opportunity. Rent a storage space, and begin stockpiling flavors, especially mango. When Vape Prohibition comes around, you\u2019ll be the Juul Al Capone, and then you can buy whatever castle you want.\n\nWhen did hard seltzer become this silly craze? Photo: Richard B. Levine/Zuma Press\n\nTake It Easy on the Flavored Seltzer. This one is actually true. I don\u2019t know when fancy seltzer became such a craze, but it\u2019s silly. Your grammy used to get seltzer delivered once a week, by a horse, and it cost 50 cents a week. She didn\u2019t need \u201chard seltzer\u201d or White Claw or any of that nonsense. That is what gin is for, kids.\n\nThere you go. Those are my financial tips for young people. My editors also wanted me to offer advice about things like splitting the check when you go out to dinner. Do I really need to explain this? Just take the check, and divide it by however many people are out at dinner, minus yourself. Collect all the money, and hop into a cab before anyone figures out what you did.\n\nBut please: don\u2019t buy a stuffed animal with it.\n\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "description": "Some other financial advice from a 500-year-old columnist: Go easy on the stuffed animals and the fancy seltzer.", "authors": ["Jason Gay", "Jason.Gay Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106182/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
