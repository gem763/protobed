Johnson to Meet EU's Juncker for First Talks: Brexit Update\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson will travel to Luxembourg for his first face-to-face talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Brexit on Monday. The prime minister has said he\u2019s hopeful of striking a deal and that both sides \u201ccan see the rough area of landing space\u201d for it.\n\nMeanwhile, political and legal challenges are mounting against Johnson\u2019s threat to deliver Brexit without a divorce deal if necessary. The British prime minister still wants a general election to break the impasse, and will appeal to voters in pro-Brexit areas of northern England in a speech on Friday.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nJohnson to travel to Luxembourg for Brexit talks with Juncker; he\u2019ll also meet his Luxembourg counterpart Xavier Bettel\n\nBritish prime minister is due to speak in northern England at 12:30 p.m. on Friday\n\nIrish PM Varadkar said \u201cexploratory discussions\u201d underway with U.K. on alternatives to the backstop, but two sides still far apart\n\nDUP\u2019s Wilson rejected report it will allow regulatory checks in the Irish Sea and that it has softened its stance on keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the EU\n\nOutgoing House of Commons Speaker John Bercow warned Johnson that MPs won\u2019t let him force a no-deal Brexit. An election will take place for a new Speaker on Nov. 4\n\nCommons to Elect New Speaker on Nov. 4 (11:35 a.m.)\n\nThe House of Commons has announced that the election for a new speaker will take place on Monday Nov. 4, shortly after the incumbent, John Bercow steps down.\n\nThe process for choosing the speaker is steeped in tradition. Once Bercow stands aside, the famous Speaker\u2019s Chair inside the Commons chamber will be occupied by the longest serving member of Parliament, 79 year-old former Chancellor Ken Clarke. He will preside over the election as the rival candidates make their pitches to the House.\n\nSuccessive secret ballots will follow, until one candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, or a single contender remains. By tradition, the winner is dragged from his seat in the Commons and marched across the chamber to take up his new position in the Speaker\u2019s Chair.\n\nBercow earlier in the week said that he\u2019ll step down On Oct. 31. His deputy, Labour\u2019s Lindsay Hoyle, is the favorite to succeed him.\n\nJohnson to Meet with Juncker on Monday (11:10 a.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson will travel to Luxembourg at \u201clunchtime\u201d on Monday for Brexit talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, his office said on Friday. It will be the first meeting between Johnson and Juncker since the British premier took office in July.\n\nLater in the day, Johnson will meet with his counterpart in Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel.\n\nThe meetings are a sign Johnson is ramping up engagement with the EU to try to resolve the impasse over Brexit. He has pledged to take the U.K. out of the bloc \u201cdo or die\u201d on Oct. 31 without a deal if necessary, but that his preference is for a divorce agreement. One U.K. official played down the chances of a breakthrough on Monday.\n\nU.K. Sees Progress in Rolling Over Trade Deals (11 a.m.)\n\nAs part of preparations for leaving the European Union, the U.K. has been trying to roll over trade deals with third countries that it currently benefits from through its EU membership, so that they also apply after Brexit. Those deals account for 139 billion pounds ($173 billion) or 10.7 percent of total trade.\n\nOn Friday, the country said it\u2019s now rolled over 64.2 percent of that trade, and that once an agreement in principle reached Sept. 10 with a group of African nations including South Africa is ratified, the proportion will be 71.2 percent. That protects 99 billion pounds of commerce; an increase of 38.5 billion pounds since March, according to the government analysis.\n\nCanada remains the biggest holdout against a rollover, with trade worth more than 18 billion pounds currently governed by the EU\u2019s deal with the North American nation. And business groups have said that even some of the rolled over deals don\u2019t protect all trade governed by the existing EU deals, because they have been weakened.\n\nFarage Shows Johnson the Way in Pro-Brexit North (10 a.m.)\n\nVoters in Hartlepool demonstrated why Boris Johnson is traveling north to deliver his election pitch on Friday. They handed control of the northeast town\u2019s council to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party, the BBC reported, delivering a significant blow to the Labour Party in an area it traditionally dominates.\n\nJohnson is targeting pro-Brexit voters who have become disillusioned with Labour as it shifts toward backing a second referendum on leaving the European Union. His Conservative Party hopes it can take seats in Leave areas to offset any it might lose to Labour or the pro-EU Liberal Democrats in Remain-leaning districts.\n\nBut the Hartlepool result is further evidence he\u2019s unlikely to get the Brexit vote to himself. Johnson\u2019s officials ruled out an electoral pact with Farage this week, but the question won\u2019t go away if the Tories see the pro-Brexit vote still split heading into a national poll.\n\nBrexit Gap \u2018Very Big,\u2019 Irish PM Says (Earlier)\n\nIdeas floated so far to replace the backstop -- the fallback measure in the Brexit withdrawal agreement designed to keep the Irish border free of checks -- fall \u201cvery short\u201d of what\u2019s needed, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said.\n\nIn interviews with Irish radio stations RTE and Newstalk, he said that while the two sides are talking and he\u2019ll fight for an agreement to the last day, a no-deal Brexit remains a \u201creal risk.\u201d Some \u201cexploratory discussions\u201d are underway with the British government as Johnson seeks \u201calternate arrangements\u201d to the backstop, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always accepted that alternative arrangements could supersede the backstop,\u201d Varadkar said. \u201cBut I think the gap is very big at the moment.\u201d\n\nWilson: \u2018Nonsense\u2019 to Say DUP Softening on Backstop (Earlier)\n\nSammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, denied the party was prepared to shift its red lines to help unlock a divorce deal between the U.K. and the European Union. Wilson was commenting after the Times newspaper reported the DUP would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea -- an idea they have always said amounted to barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nThe Times article is \u201ctotally untrue,\u201d Wilson told BBC Radio. A concession on those lines \u201cis contrary to the position we have adopted throughout the debate,\u201d he said, adding that Boris Johnson\u2019s government has \u201chas made it quite clear that it will not accept an arrangement which has a backstop, which separates Northern Ireland out from the rest of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nEarlier:\n\nBercow Warns Johnson MPs Won\u2019t Let Him Force a No-Deal BrexitBoris Johnson Still Has a Fighting Chance: Therese RaphaelBoris Johnson May Get Brexit Help from Hungary: Brexit Bulletin", "description": "Johnson to Meet EU's Juncker for First Talks: Brexit Update", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED2M1GV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
