Obviously the backlash in this poll is to his frequent noisy criticism of Trump. It comes with caveats, of course. First, Romney\u2019s not up for reelection until 2024 (and who knows if he\u2019ll even run again). He\u2019ll be there hounding the president to the bitter end even if Trump gets a second term no matter how low his polling in Utah goes. Second, I\u2019m not sure Romney particularly cares about his polling. His attacks lately on Trump are clearly the work of a guy who\u2019s thinking more about his legacy than his hold on his seat. If he ends up as Jeff Flake and has to retire because he can\u2019t win a primary, on a scale of one to 100 I\u2019d guess his anxiety about that is somewhere in the neighborhood of \u201cone.\u201d And third, although Mike Lee has been a loyal soldier for Trump in the Senate for the most part (even backing his Syria withdrawal recently), Lee\u2019s job approval is no better than Mitt\u2019s. He\u2019s at 43/47 compared to Romney\u2019s 46/51. If kissing Trump\u2019s ass is the secret to popularity with Republicans in Utah, why isn\u2019t Lee at 60/40 or whatever?\n\nLeave all that aside, though. This is a fantastic poll for Trump if only because it shows other Republicans in the Senate that not even Mitt Romney is immune from a backlash in Utah for criticizing him. If the first Mormon presidential nominee can be underwater in a state where Mormons are 60+ percent of the population simply because he\u2019s anti-Trump, God help any GOP senator whose political position isn\u2019t as secure in their own home state. See why I\u2019m skeptical that Schumer will find even four Republicans to join with Democrats to give the pro-removal vote a majority of the Senate?\n\nAlthough Romney\u2019s and Lee\u2019s overall approval numbers are nearly identical, the partisan coalitions that form their bases are starkly different. As you\u2019d expect, right-wingers love Lee and then his popularity fades as you move further left. Romney, however, is disliked by both the very right-wing and very left-wing \u2014 and pretty popular among everyone in between.\n\n\u2014 Romney\u2019s approval rate among \u201cstrong Republicans\u201d is actually underwater: Only 40 percent approve of him, while 59 percent disapprove of him. That is rather amazing. \u2014 But \u201cstrong Republicans\u201d really like Lee, 72-19 percent. Romney\u2019s problem with the reddest of his party is no doubt because he has been critical of Trump, while Lee has mostly stood by the president. Romney rebounds among those who said they are \u201cnot very strong Republicans.\u201d He has a 71-23 percent approval rating among them. Lee\u2019s approval rating among that GOP group is 59-24 percent. True political independents give Romney a 44-52 percent approval rating; Lee gets 36-53 percent approval from this group.\n\nThe most dramatic difference between them comes among Democrats. Lee is at single digits in approval among independent-leaning Dems, not-very-strong Dems, and strong Dems. By comparison, Romney is at 36 percent, 65 percent(!), and 32 percent among those groups, respectively. Obviously you\u2019d rather have Lee\u2019s coalition in a state as red as Utah than Mitt\u2019s, since Mitt is more susceptible to a primary challenge and wouldn\u2019t win most of those Democratic voters who approve of him right now in a general election. But these numbers do go to show that stalwart support for Trump is no guarantee of overall popularity even in a state as Republican as Utah. In fact, the same poll found that all three Republican members of Utah\u2019s House delegation are *also* underwater in approval while the state\u2019s lone Democrat in the House is in positive territory. That suggests that many voters aren\u2019t thrilled with the GOP\u2019s decision to stand by Trump on impeachment.\n\nElsewhere today, Tim Miller is urging Senator Delecto to take the final step in his political journey, a step made easier by the rising prospect of him not being reelected in Utah: It\u2019s third-party time. No, no, not a third-party presidential candidacy. A new third party. To change the balance of power in the Senate.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is electorally viable on a small scale. Mitt himself, thanks to his profile and the unique nature of the electorate in Utah, could survive without succumbing to the partisan poles that most politicians are slaves to. Secondly there are some obvious candidates for existing politicians who could join him to create a real organization. Moderate Republican governors Charlie Baker and Phil Scott from his erstwhile home in New England. Other anti-Trump electeds in Utah. Other Republicans in blue states or Democrats in red states who might need to shed their toxic party brand to survive. And most importantly a few fellow senators who might be interested in making a similar calculation: Namely Lisa Murkowski and Joe Manchin.\n\nHe has a point about GOP governors. Figures like Charlie Baker and Larry Hogan really do seem to belong to a separate party already. It\u2019s not just that they\u2019re moderate GOPers governing very blue states, it\u2019s that they have no presence whatsoever in the right-wing media ecosystem. Surely they and other prominent but now out-of-office figures like John Kasich and Flake would be interested initially in the \u201cPierre Party,\u201d let\u2019s call it. And Miller\u2019s also right that *if* the Senate shakes out a certain way next fall, even a small bloc of three like Romney, Murkowski, and Manchin could exert outsized influence over the body. If the Senate ends up as 51/49 in favor of the GOP and those three break away, they could effectively choose who the majority leader is, how the Senate operates, and so on.\n\nIt\u2019d be almost hallucinatory to have the last 10 years of Republican politics end up with a third party led by Mitt Romney, of all people, brokering power in the Senate. The decade began with a populist righty backlash to ObamaCare that produced the tea party, a movement that wrestled with whether to try to take over the GOP or break away. It lost in 2012 with Romney, who was never a great fit for cultural reasons, but won its greatest victory with Trump, who was never a great fit for ideological reasons and who himself functioned as a sort of independent during the primaries. Under Miller\u2019s plan this would culminate with Romney ceding the GOP to Trumpist forces and breaking away to form his own moderate outfit for centrist Republicans that could conceivably end up roadblocking the populists\u2019 agenda in the Senate. Even the writers of the virtual reality we live in would consider it too far-fetched, I think, but it has an intriguing symmetry. Besides, if you believe today\u2019s poll, Romney may well end up as a one-termer. Might as well make the most of his remaining time!", "description": "Backlash.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/m-7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
