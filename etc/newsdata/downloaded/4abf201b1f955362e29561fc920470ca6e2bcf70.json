That did not come to pass, and streaming services are currently without new Christ-inspired bars from the legendary rapper.\n\nHowever, Chicago rap blogger Andrew Barber reports Jesus Is King, West\u2019s gospel-inspired project, is very real.\n\nTaking to Twitter after Kanye premiered the record\u2019s visual accompaniment at Chicago\u2019s Fox Theater, Barber said the beats \u201cpulled from elements of previous sounds that people loved from WTT, 808s, Yeezus, Cruel Summer & MBDTF.\u201d\n\nThe project reportedly features both members of Clipse and Kenny G on one song, reflecting his longrunning appreciation for Pusha T, No Malice, and the veteran saxsmith.\n\nNotably, Barber said the mercurial musician also vowed to avoid secular music in the future, instead opting to release more Christ-adjacent music in the vein of his ongoing Sunday Service sessions.\n\nKanye also announced that he is no longer making secular music.
