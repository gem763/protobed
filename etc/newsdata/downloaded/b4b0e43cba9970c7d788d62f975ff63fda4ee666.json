In the past quarter century, aviation has been transformed from an expensive minority sport to an everyday experience that enriches economies and lives.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe flight path to success has been littered with failures. Casualties of the unforgiving economics of aviation include large enterprises such as XL Airways and Monarch.\n\nMany minor airlines such as VLM, EUjet and Debonair also closed down. They used the wrong kind of planes (usually small, old and inefficient), and lacked the scale to compete effectively.\n\nYet it is startling how many good ideas were abandoned by players who you would imagine might know better. Time after time, successful businesses and businesspeople failed to identify the green shoots of success in the low-cost airlines they created.\n\nWhile the European Union created the conditions for easyJet and Ryanair to flourish with the \u201copen skies\u201d package in the early 1990s, it was built on pioneering liberalisation in the early 1980s involving Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands.\n\nA young entrepreneur named Richard Branson, who had just started up Virgin Atlantic between London and New York, spied the possibility of a link from the Dutch city of Maastricht to Gatwick, where his transatlantic airline was based. He chartered a Vickers Viscount propeller plane to fly it.\n\nThe prop-hop from Maastricht was intended mainly to help fill the daily jumbo jet from Gatwick to Newark. But it mean that, for the first time, British travellers had a low-cost option to fly to a corner of Netherlands that also gave easy access to western Germany and eastern Belgium.\n\nYet even though Virgin\u2019s Dutch adventure put the airline a decade ahead of rivals, it was quietly dropped after five years.\n\n\u201cThere was concern that a low-cost, no-frills airline was detracting from the Virgin brand in the marketplace,\u201d Sir Richard (as he had become) later told me. \u201cWe certainly missed an opportunity. It would have been fine for us to have both brands.\u201d\n\nIt was one thing for an entrepreneur who had cut his teeth in the music business to fail to spot a gap in the market, but Britain\u2019s biggest holiday company did exactly the same.\n\nThomson (now TUI) owned Britannia Airways, a giant charter carrier. Someone at the Luton Airport HQ had the bright idea of deploying spare capacity to open a scheduled link to Belfast. But the concept of making scheduled flying feasible for normal people was undervalued, undermarketed and soon abandoned.\n\nTwo decades later, the second attempt at scheduled operations, branded Thomsonfly, compounded the failure: it launched at Coventry Airport, a facility which was just 13 miles from Birmingham Airport, and about 13 times more difficult to reach. It did not last long.\n\nThen there is the curious case of Go.\n\nThe track record of big airlines starting budget brands is terrible: Air Canada\u2019s Zip, Delta Airlines\u2019 Song and United\u2019s Ted comprise a good definition of commercial failure.\n\nYet when, in 1997, British Airways chose to take on easyJet and Ryanair with low-cost competition from an in-house start up, the airline did many things right. \u201cOperation Blue Sky\u201d led to Go, created at arm\u2019s length from BA by a visionary chief executive, Barbara Cassani.\n\nThe airline made a shaky start (the first Go flight was hijacked, from a publicity perspective, by easyJet\u2019s founder, Stelios), but began to prosper. British Airways could have used Go to turn a profit on loss-making routes, but instead in 2001 let it, er, go for \u00a3100m in a management buy-out.\n\nThose buyers turned a very handsome profit the following year, when easyJet paid \u00a3374m for Go \u2013 which it later subsumed.\n\nSince then, British Airways\u2019 short-haul services have changed to the point where they more or less mirror Go. The process would have been so much smoother had unprofitable routes migrated across to Go. BA\u2019s failure to identify success cost it time, money and even reputational damage.\n\nDuring its brief existence, I flew on Go from Stansted to Copenhagen. I must make the trip again soon to visit the place where much of Ruth Alexander\u2019s excellent radio programme was recorded: the Museum of Failure in Helsingborg, southern Sweden, showcasing some of the business world\u2019s worst ideas. You can reach it easily from the Danish capital.\n\nTwenty years ago the trip to Copenhagen on Go cost \u00a3100 return; in November this year Ryanair will take you there and back for \u00a325. Against fares like that, VLM Airlines will not be the last airline to fail.", "description": "Barely had I finished listening to \u201cFailures, Flops and Flaws\u201d\u00a0on Radio 4 than VLM Airlines, a\u00a0regional carrier based in Antwerp. became\u00a0the latest European airline to fail.
