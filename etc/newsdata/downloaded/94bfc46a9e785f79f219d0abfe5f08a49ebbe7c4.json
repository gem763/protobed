After that period, you can find the notification by going to Settings > General > About,' said the company.\n\nAs noted by The Verge, Apple also alludes to the possibility that it will keep close track of those who are served warnings regarding their displays, meaning it could possibly affect Apple's willingness to fix other issues in the future.\n\n'You might see an additional notification that says, \u201cApple has updated the device information for this iPhone.\u201d This means that Apple has updated the device information maintained for your iPhone for service needs, safety analysis, and to improve future products,' says the company in the support document.\n\nApple's Issues with uncertified display repairs mirror a recent effort by the company to deter third-party battery replacements.\n\nUnlike fixing a display, however, battery replacements present a very real safety risk, as phones could potentially overheat and in the worst case, catch fire.\n\nDespite recent warnings against third-party repairs, Apple has slowly started to warm to the idea of extending its constellation of Apple-certified services.\n\nApple unveiled a new series of iPhones this month which includes the iPhone 11 (pictured above) and the iPhone 11 Pro (File photo)\n\nLast month, the company expanded a repair program that will provide more independent phone repair stores with 'the same genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics as its Apple Authorized Service Providers.'\n\nAs long as the store has a certified Apple technician, they will be able to join its program for free, meaning nearly any and all third-party repair spot could now be allowed to provide iPhone repairs -- at least for older models.\n\nThe program will be confined only to iPhones that are out of warranty meaning newer Apple products will still have to be sent back to the company for repair.", "description": "To deter iPhone 11 users from ignoring the company, customers who decided to have their phone repaired by a non-certified\u00a0 technician will be reminded by some rather persistent notifications.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/16/18972230-0-image-a-7_1569512958831.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
