When that chance finally came, things didn\u2019t quite pan out how he had hoped.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t stopping the Brit, who recently changed his nickname from \u201cThe Hangman\u201d to Saul \u201cBusiness\u201d Rogers and is taking a positive outlook on his elimination from the Bellator featherweight grand prix.\n\nChatting to MMA Junkie after returning home from his decision loss to Daniel Weichel at Bellator 228, Rogers (13-3 MMA, 1-1 BMMA) said he would use his grand prix appearance as a springboard to bigger and better things as a Bellator fighter.\n\n\u201cI could be sat depressed about that loss and wallow in self-pity, but it\u2019s going to do absolutely nothing for my career,\u201d the 29-year-old said. \u201cSo instead of looking at the negatives, I\u2019ve taken all the positives from there (and) the things that didn\u2019t go well, I\u2019ve put into place how to fix them and advance them.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s a blessing in disguise, and every time I\u2019ve lost a fight I\u2019ve come back hungrier, stronger and more motivated than ever. So this is just going to be the catalyst to go out there and get that world title.\u201d\n\nRogers admitted that he was initially a little taken aback by the sheer scale of the event at The Forum in Inglewood, Calif., near Los Angeles, but said he felt completely at home in his new surroundings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I actually understood the magnitude of how big that card was until a few days before the fight and I saw the promotion and advertising that went into it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd being in there and seeing The Forum and how the draw was going to work, it was unreal. To fight on the main card, I felt that\u2019s where I should have been fighting all these years. I felt at home, I swear to you.\u201d\n\nWhile he felt comfortable on the big stage, Rogers\u2019 fight with two-time title challenger Weichel didn\u2019t go according to plan. After a composed first four minutes, the Brit was caught with a big shot in the final 10 seconds of the round that had him on wobbly legs until the bell. It proved crucial in the final reckoning as Weichel polled scores of 29-28, 30-27, 29-28 to take the win.\n\nGallery Daniel Weichel def.

I was pinging him. I was landing the cleaner work. He didn\u2019t land a shot on me until that last 10 seconds. I thought I won the second comfortably, and then the third was close, but he edged it. So, bar that last 10 seconds of that first round \u2013 that\u2019s what cost me that fight.\u201d\n\nRogers said he had no complaints with the decision, and said he was taking the positives from a narrow loss to such an experienced fighter who has been campaigning at the top level for so long.\n\n\u201cHis only recent losses have been split decisions, he\u2019s fought for the title, he\u2019s the most experienced fighter on the Bellator roster, and for me to go in there and put on that performance and hang in there just shows that I belong at the world level,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for me, that was my first time fighting on a card of that magnitude and at that level. Bar that one mistake, that was my fight to win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s at his peak, and I feel I\u2019m nowhere near there (yet). I\u2019ve watched the fight back and I know there\u2019s a few minor tweaks and fix-ups I can do that will take me to a whole new level. I still think I can be the best fighter on that roster and in a couple of years the cream will rise to the top.\u201d\n\nRogers is contemplating his next move. And, while he resisted the temptation to accept Bellator\u2019s recent offer and jump straight back into the cage in Milan, Italy, this past weekend, he does have his sights set on a return before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s cards coming up all over,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a London card coming up soon \u2013 that might be a little bit soon for me. But I\u2019ve seen they\u2019ve announced the Japan card with Fedor (Emelianenko) and (Quinton) \u2018Rampage\u2019 (Jackson) fighting on Dec. 29. That would be absolutely perfect for me, so I\u2019m going to see if I can get my name put forward for that.\n\n\u201cI fought in Japan just before I went on \u2018The Ultimate Fighter.\u2019 I fought for Real Fight Championship, I think it was called. I was actually supposed to fight Kron Gracie on one of those shows, but it never ended up happening. That would have been a cool fight. But I\u2019ve fought all over America now. I\u2019ve done the \u2018TUF\u2019 stuff. I\u2019ve done Ireland. I\u2019ve traveled all through fighting. But hands down, Japan is still the best place I\u2019ve ever fought on earth. I can\u2019t wait to go back. I want to go back.\u201d\n\nWith the tournament now moving on without him, Rogers says his task is clear: Pick up a string of victories to position himself for a shot at whoever wins the tournament.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good guys and a lot of good fights I can fight outside the tournament,\u201d he said. \u201cThe plan is to rack up some nice wins while the tournament is still going on. Three nice wins, three dominant performances, three good finishes and I feel like when that tournament\u2019s done I\u2019ll be calling out the champion.\u201d", "description": "Bellator featherweight Saul Rogers says he plans on racking up the wins to position himself for a shot at the featherweight GP winner.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/daniel-weichel-saul-rogers-bellator-228-3.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
