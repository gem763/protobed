Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\nCould the highly sought-after vaping constituency be the group that hands the 2020 election to the Democratic candidate? Probably not, but according to Axios, some conservative analysts sending their data to the White House think that Trump\u2019s recent ban on e-cigarette flavors could hurt him in battleground states, where the number of vapers outnumbers the president\u2019s margin of victory in 2016.\n\nThe (flawed) logic is that adults who really like mango Juul pods will be so frustrated by Trump\u2019s proposed flavor ban that they will vote for the Democratic candidate. \u201cWhile parents may be concerned about e-cigarettes, the people who genuinely care about vaping as a voting issue so far outweighs the number of people Trump needs to win in 2020 that they are royally screwing themselves by doing this,\u201d Paul Blair, of Americans for Tax Reform, told Axios. Another industry lobbyist claimed that the parents who support the flavor ban \u201cdon\u2019t have the same voter intensity on this as adult vapers do.\u201d\n\nA test case for the esteemed vape vote lies in Florida. Trump won the state by 113,000 votes in 2016, but if just one in eight of the 873,000 state\u2019s e-cigarette users of voting age switches parties, Trump could lose 29 electoral votes. Other possible vape states that the analysts fear could turn blue are Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Wisconsin \u2014 or about a quarter of the electoral college.\n\nThe logic isn\u2019t perfect, however. As Axios notes, the analysis relies on four assumptions about vaping voters: that they are Trump voters in the first place; that they would stop vaping if it doesn\u2019t taste like mint or cucumber anymore; that they are single-issue voters; and that the eventual Democratic nominee would have to be in the pocket of Big Vape to swing these votes.\n\nConsidering the industry\u2019s disdain for Trump\u2019s proposed flavor ban, it\u2019s possible that their data dump on the White House could be an attempt to convince the president to end his war on cr\u00e8me pods once and for all. Shortly after Trump announced the proposal, industry groups and conservatives lambasted him for it, claiming that it would hurt small business owners. Campaign manager Brad Parscale, who is running a $125 million operation, went so far as to respond on Twitter to a college student who called the action \u201cnot on brand with MAGA. The Democrats are the party of banning, not is [sic].\u201d", "description": "Some conservative analysts think that President Trump\u2019s recent ban on e-cigarette flavors could hurt him in battleground states, where the number of vapers outnumbers the president\u2019s margin of victory in 2016.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/22/juul_2020.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
