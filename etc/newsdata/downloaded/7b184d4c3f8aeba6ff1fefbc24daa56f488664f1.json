Get in touch: emma.munbodh@mirror.co.uk\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nIf you\u2019re a Vodafone customer that's been affected by any of the two named issues, make sure you check your bill.\n\nFind out if you've been charged for the right tariff, whether you've been billed for any roaming charges, and whether the amount you've been told is accurate.\n\nRemember, roaming is free in the UK and Europe as part of new rules introduced in 2017.\n\nIf you think there\u2019s something wrong then you need to challenge your mobile phone bill by reporting it to Vodafone.\n\nHowever, the company has said that it's in the process of rectifying any issues already - stating customers do not need to get in touch on the back of the errors.\n\n\"Customers will not be charged and do not need to worry about contacting us as we are proactively checking accounts,\" the statement added.\n\nYou can contact Vodafone by either calling 191 for free from your Vodafone mobile or contacting it online.\n\nAlternatively, you can open an online chat by clicking on the 'Pay monthly' button and choosing the 'Start Live Chat' option.\n\nYou'll need to enter your name and mobile number to get started. You'll also be able to print or save a copy of transcript using the icons at the top of the dialogue box.\n\nMake sure you keep a record of all correspondence, including dates and the names of anyone you speak to.\n\nIf you're unhappy with the network's resolution, you can escalate it to the Ombudsman Services: Communications after eight weeks - or once you've had a formal response from Vodafone on your case.\n\nRu Bhikha, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, said: \"Vodafone customers who have been incorrectly charged for using their phone while abroad will be in for an absolute shock when their next bill arrives.\n\n\"The fact that his can still happen is incredibly disappointing and I would expect Ofcom to show a keen interest into how this is resolved.\n\n\"The onus has to be on mobile phone operators to proactively fix this for any customer who is out of pocket, it is also important to acknowledge the knock on effects this could have on their customers\u2019 finances.\n\n\"If you are a Vodafone customer and think you\u2019ve been incorrectly billed, check your statements to see whether the amount you\u2019ve been charged matches what you\u2019ve signed up for\n\n\"Whenever you have a complaint with your mobile phone provider, the first step is to complain to them directly, sometimes using social media, can get you a response quicker than doing so by email or on the phone.\n\n\"If you remain unhappy you can always take your complaints to the relevant ombudsman, who will look into your complaint independently and do so for free.\u201d\n\nRefund and compensation rights when a network goes down\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhen a network goes down, your provider is responsible for ensuring faults are fixed, and for keeping you informed of progress.\n\n\"In most cases, your provider should be able to establish reasonably quickly what has gone wrong and, if it is a network service issue, tell you how and when it will be fixed,\" Ofcom explains.\n\n\"Depending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate for your provider to offer you some money back while repairs are being carried out.\"\n\nIn more extreme cases, where repairs take much longer (for example it takes longer than usual to access a mast site to undertake repairs), you may be entitled to an additional refund or account credit.\n\nThis is to account for the inconvenience caused during the outage.\n\nIf you've been specifically left out of pocket by the technical error for any reason, such as having to pay for public wifi, you can complain to your provider and ask for compensation to cover any unexpected expenses.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nKeep all evidence including receipts and emails for this as you will have to prove the expenses in your claim.\n\n\"In cases where you have been without service for some time, you may also have the right to leave the contract without penalty,\" Ofcom adds.\n\nThere may be a term in your contract saying you can do this if your provider has failed in its obligations to you or breached a key condition.\n\nIf you've been sent an incorrect bill - and overcharged as a result - speak to the network immediately to get a refund.\n\nThis should take no more than three to five working days.\n\nIf you've incurred any financial losses as a result of Vodafone, such as overdraft fees or a direct debit payment bounced due to insufficient funds, keep evidence and claim this back from Vodafone.\n\nVodafone customers are paying for a service that rightly expect to receive.\n\nIf they don't deliver, you are also well within your rights to ask for the money back covering the hours affected.\n\nThis would most likely be your monthly bill divided by the month and multiplied by the number of hours affected. Vodafone will most likely have a threshold in place for pay-as-you-go customers.\n\nI'm struggling to reach a resolution - what should I do?\n\nIf you raise a case with Vodafone, but you're unhappy with the outcome, you can submit your complaint to an independent Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) scheme after eight weeks.\n\nIf your problem cannot be resolved, ask your provider for a \u2018deadlock\u2019 letter so that you can refer your dispute to the relevant ADR scheme directly before the eight week mark.\n\nOfcom has approved two ADR schemes - CISAS and Ombudsman Services: Communications.", "description": "A major outage on Sunday left many users without service while dozens of others have been overcharged for data roaming on their statements - here's what you need to know", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Afp", "Getty", "Afp Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11009117.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Vodafone-signage-seen-outside-a-store-in.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
