S&P raised its number to 5.4 times earnings, citing \"normalized\" figures that also took into account Newell's asset sales.\n\nAn S&P spokesman said in an email that \"our analysis speaks for itself.\"\n\nMoody's confirmed its 2018 calculation included earnings from businesses Newell had sold. Moody's said the calculation was just a different way of measuring leverage, though it agreed that double-counting amortization was an error, and said it corrected it in October.\n\nKraft and Newell long-term bonds trade in junk territory. S&P and Moody's predict Newell will reduce its debt to about four times earnings within the next year or so.\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com and Cezary Podkul at cezary.podkul@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 21, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
