He said the group won\u2019t be allowed to appear without lawyers from the executive branch.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: I will not tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State,\u201d Pompeo wrote.\n\nPompeo, who is currently traveling in Italy, will face considerable congressional scrutiny over Ukraine, especially after it became known Monday that he heard the phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on July 25, in which Trump asked Ukraine to investigate allegations of corruption surrounding Democrat Joe Biden and his son.\n\nPompeo brushed off a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint that stemmed from the call, saying at a news conference last week that he hadn\u2019t read the document. In previous interviews, he had also declined to pass judgment on whether the call was appropriate but said Biden should be investigated.\n\n\u201cI hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate I hope the American people come to learn that,\u201d Pompeo said on ABC News on Sept. 22.\n\nTuesday\u2019s letter made clear that Pompeo, who is one of Trump\u2019s most loyal aides and rarely disagrees with him publicly, plans to help the president fight the impeachment proceedings.\n\nWilling Witnesses\n\nWhile Pompeo, a former congressman and CIA director, said in a tweet and in his letter that he was protecting State Department officials from bullying by lawmakers, his moves also could block the testimony of some current and former diplomats who are willing to appear. The question now is whether he can stop them from talking to Congress even if they want to.\n\nKurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine who is mentioned in the whistle-blower report and resigned his post on Friday, has been preparing to speak with the committee on Oct. 3, when the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight panels asked him to appear. He didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nThe committees had scheduled the depositions to start Wednesday with Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who remains in the foreign service and is a fellow at Georgetown University. The other three to be deposed were Pompeo adviser Ulrich Brechbuhl, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent.\n\n(Updates with details from Pompeo letter in second paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Nick Wadhams in Washington at nwadhams@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Larry Liebert\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Secretary of State Michael Pompeo rejected a plan by three House committees to take testimony from five State Department officials starting Wednesday, calling the proposed depositions an attempt to \u201cintimidate, bully, & treat improperly\u201d his employees.", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
