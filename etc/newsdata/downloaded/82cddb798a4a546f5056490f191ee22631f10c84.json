But that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t hit an all-time low yet again.\n\nTake Sharpiegate. Yes, every little thing in Washington eventually gets a \u201c-gate\u201d suffix, no matter how insignificant.\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian moved across the Caribbean last month, very early forecasts showed the possibly Category 5 storm might hit Florida hard. In what are called \u201cspaghetti models\u201d \u2014 a couple of dozen lines showing projections for where a given tropical storm or hurricane might go \u2014 one showed Dorian crossing Florida and moving into the Gulf of Mexico before doubling back across the state. Several showed the path crossing over into parts of Alabama.\n\nThe storm was still hundreds of miles east of Puerto Rico, so the models were virtually meaningless.\n\nPresident Trump and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan updated the media on Dorian in an Oval Office briefing. Mr. Trump held up a map from the National Hurricane Center that showed the \u201ccone\u201d of the storm. But on the edge, drawn in black magic marker, was another smaller half-circle that extended the cone into the Florida panhandle and Alabama.\n\nThen the real hurricane descended on Washington, the media declaring that Mr. Trump had falsely claimed that the hurricane was going to \u201chit\u201d Alabama. At one point, The Washington Post cited an unnamed source saying Mr. Trump himself had drawn the half-circle on the big map, asserting that Mr. Trump is known to use Sharpies.\n\nThe \u201cscandal\u201d quickly became #Sharpiegate.\n\nDay after day, the media penned pieces on how Mr. Trump had said Alabama was ground zero for Dorian. By Sept. 5 \u2014 Day 7 of the biggest story in Washington \u2014 Mr. Trump took to Twitter to defend himself.\n\n\u201cIn the early days of the hurricane, when it was predicted that Dorian would go through Miami or West Palm Beach, even before it reached the Bahamas, certain models strongly suggested that Alabama & Georgia would be hit as it made its way through Florida & to the Gulf,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nMr. Trump followed up by tweeting: \u201cAlabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News!\u201d\n\nOn and on the major \u201cscandal\u201d went. It got stupider and stupider, sure, but on it went nevertheless.\n\nBefore we move on with The Story of the Century, let\u2019s stop and point out that huge hurricanes \u2014 which Dorian certainly was \u2014 often have major rain and wind bands that stretch for hundreds of miles. Based on the very early projection, had Dorian come straight into Florida, Alabama would surely had been affected \u2014 if not by hurricane-force winds, at least by heavy rain and possible flooding.\n\nDoubt that? Think back to Hurricane Irene in 2011. The media spent days breathlessly saying the huge storm was projected to directly hit New York City. It didn\u2019t. But it did hit \u2014 Vermont. Hard. Almost every river and stream in Vermont flooded and many of the historic covered bridged were damaged or destroyed.\n\nHurricanes affect areas hundreds of miles from where they make landfall. Case closed.\n\nBy Sept. 7, the whole story started to change.\n\n\u201cThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a statement from an unidentified spokesman stating that information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to the president had demonstrated that \u2018tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama,\u2019\u201d The Associated Press reported. \u201cThe advisories were dated from last Wednesday, Aug. 28, through Monday, the statement read.\u201d\n\n\u201cParts of Alabama were covered, usually with 5% to 10% chances, between Aug. 27 and Sept. 3. Maps on Aug. 30 grew to cover far more of Alabama, but for only 12 hours, and the highest percentage hit 20% to 30% before quickly shrinking back down,\u201d the AP said.\n\nAnd there you go. At least for some period of time, the storm \u2014 or its remnants, or its outer bands, or something \u2014 was expected to affect Alabama.\n\nMr. Trump wasn\u2019t wrong, but the media just couldn\u2019t let it go. And they sought out people who would say so.\n\n\u201cPeople are used to the president saying things that aren\u2019t true, but this Alabama stuff is another story,\u201d sources told the heavily liberal site The Independent in a piece headlined \u201c\u2018Trump is in severe mental decline\u2019: Concerns raised over president\u2019s health.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one knows what to expect from him anymore,\u201d one former White House official told Business Insider, speaking anonymously.\n\nThen Britain\u2019s Daily Mail tabloid, got into the act. \u201cWorkers in the National Weather Service are \u2018shocked, stunned and irate\u2019 at their bosses in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for backing Trump up and claiming that he was right to say Hurricane Dorian was headed for Alabama.\u201d\n\nBut now, two weeks later \u2014 and long after Dorian came and went \u2014 the story is finally losing wind.\n\nOnly to be replaced by this from The New York Times: \u201cTrump Had Deal With Scotland Airport That Sent Flight Crews to His Resort.\u201d\n\nGet ready for a week of #Resortgate \u2014 and more idiocy from America\u2019s media.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
