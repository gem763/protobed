When a diversity task force recommended the elimination of New York City\u2019s school programs for gifted students, the committee and the news media lumped Hispanics into one racial category, calling the city\u2019s Hispanic-majority schools \u201csegregated\u201d without paying attention to how racial differences among Hispanics affect identities and outcomes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHispanics constitute an ethnic community, not a race \u2014 a distinction evident on forms that ask if you\u2019re non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanics identify as white (65 percent), \u201csome other race\u201d (27 percent), mixed race (5 percent), black (2 percent), indigenous (1 percent) and Asian (0.4 percent), among other designations. Seeing Hispanics as a racial group erases our diversity and discounts the racism and pigmentocracy that plague Hispanic societies. To ask Afro-Hispanics to choose between being black and being Hispanic is to negate their unique identity. To ask white Hispanics to distance themselves from their European heritage is to diminish the important ways Spain helped shape the United States. From Spain\u2019s blue-eyed King Felipe VI to members of Peru\u2019s Japanese-descendant Fujimori political dynasty, Hispanics can look like anyone. Such differences require more nuance than we get when we consolidate Hispanics into one race.\n\nMyth No. 2\n\nSpanish is a foreign language in the United States.\n\nMany viral videos in recent years have featured English-speaking Americans whining in front of Spanish-speaking Americans with profanity-laced tirades that showcase their xenoglossophobia (fear of foreign languages). Although the United States has never had an official language, bans on the use of German, the shuttering of Japanese-language schools and \u201cEnglish only \u201d movements are scattered throughout the nation\u2019s history. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) has repeatedly introduced the \u201cEnglish Language Unity Act\u201d to make English the country\u2019s official language. And according to a 2018 Public Religion Research Institute poll, 83 percent of Americans believe that being able to speak English is \u201csomewhat or very important to being American.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut through it all, Spanish has remained the second-most-spoken language in the nation , which is unsurprising considering that the U.S. population of 58 million Hispanics is more than Spain\u2019s and second only to Mexico\u2019s. In fact, Spanish was the first European language to be widely spoken in what is now the United States. Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u2019s 1513 report on Florida described natives speaking Spanish \u2014 either from contact with a previous Spaniard or because they had immigrated from Spanish-speaking colonies. Ultimately, of course, indigenous tribes were here first. But once Europeans began to arrive, from Ponce de Le\u00f3n in Florida (1513) to Lucas V\u00e1zquez in South Carolina (1526) to Hernando de Soto in Arkansas (1541), Hispanics mapped coastlines, established cities and celebrated an American Thanksgiving 50 years before English-speaking immigrants did.\n\nMyth No. 3\n\nHispanics support liberal immigration policies.\n\nA comprehensive Dallas Morning News report on immigration and the 2020 Latino vote said that President Trump\u2019s immigration policies are \u201cexpected to fuel a historic turnout among Latinos.\u201d The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda maintains that \u201cfederal immigration law and policy continues to be a top priority for the Latino community.\u201d Such claims create the sense that Hispanics naturally embrace liberal immigration policies. After the 2018 midterm elections saw Democrats lose Hispanic votes in Florida, Simon Rosenberg, president of the Democratic group NDN, cited Trump\u2019s relentless attacks on immigrants and declared with surprise, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat happened is that Hispanics do not speak in unison when it comes to immigration. In a Washington Post-ABC News poll from April, 36 percent of Hispanics described \u201cthe situation with illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border\u201d as \u201ca crisis,\u201d similar to the share of Americans overall who said the same. Organizations such as the Latino Coalition offer complex views: They support legal immigration, encourage stronger security to deter illegal immigration and oppose local municipalities that defy federal immigration laws.\n\nMyth No. 4\n\n'Hispanic' and 'Latino' are synonyms.\n\nThe frequent use of the slashed term \u201cHispanic/Latino\u201d implies that the identities are interchangeable. From the Presbyterian Church to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, many organizations mirror the general public in switching between \u201cHispanic\u201d and \u201cLatino\u201d mid-sentence. Similarly, a page of tips for quitting smoking from the CDC repeatedly equates the two words, noting, for example, \u201cAmong Hispanics/Latinos, cigarette smoking is more common in men than women.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHispanic\u201d stems from Hispania, the Roman Empire\u2019s name for Spain, so it refers to the peoples and cultures of Spain and its former colonies. \u201cLatino\u201d describes the peoples and cultures where colonizers spoke Latin-derived languages such as Spanish, French and Portuguese. The term \u201cLatin America\u201d was coined in the 1800s to differentiate Romance-language-speaking areas from English- and Dutch-controlled territories: People from Brazil (Portuguese) and Haiti (French) can be considered Latino but not Hispanic.\n\nThe federal government has used the term \u201cHispanic\u201d since the 1970s, when health official Grace Flores-Hughes argued that the community needed better services. Instead of continuing to be categorized as just white, Hispanics could now be classified as a distinct group separate from the Latino label, which could include Italians and Brazilians.\n\nMyth No. 5\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump can't win over Hispanic voters.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s callous attitude toward Hispanics and his disingenuous appeals to the community, analysts predict that Latinos will not vote for his reelection. Organizations such as UnidosUS and the League of United Latin American Citizens, as well as pundits such as Ana Navarro, lambaste Trump\u2019s insensitivity to the Hispanic community. And polls do find that a majority of Hispanics say they won\u2019t vote for Trump in 2020, which would mirror presidential preferences since 1980.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Trump can\u2019t appeal to enough Hispanic voters to make a difference. In 2016, Trump received 28 percent of the national Hispanic vote but 35 percent of Florida\u2019s Hispanic vote, helping cement his one-percentage-point victory in the state. Savvy campaigns understand that the Hispanic community is not a monolith. Trump\u2019s campaign has invested early in Florida \u2014 where the Hispanic population largely comprises Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan political refugees \u2014 with narrowly tailored appeals to communism-abhorring voters who are wary of political rhetoric that evokes even Europe\u2019s socialist democracies, and with an eye on the growing number of antiabortion Hispanic evangelicals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite their outreach efforts, Democratic campaigns flounder when they take the Hispanic vote for granted and pander to the community. Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss demonstrated that having a Spanish-speaking gringo like Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) as your running mate isn\u2019t enough. Trump \u2014 despite, and perhaps because of, his blunt, offensive and arrogant rhetoric \u2014 will continue to appeal to a certain segment of the Hispanic population: American citizens whose families fled leftist regimes and are emboldened by promises of good jobs, low taxes and the American Dream.\n\nFive myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.
