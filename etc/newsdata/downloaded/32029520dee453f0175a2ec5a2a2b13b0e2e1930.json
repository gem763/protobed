(Image: Alberto E. Rodriguez, Getty Image)\n\nWith the launch of Disney\u2019s new streaming platform right around the corner, there\u2019s been a bit of a structural change over at the House of Mouse. It signals that the studio is nothing but serious about trying to ensure the platform\u2019s success. After shepherding Marvel\u2019s cinematic universe, Kevin Feige\u2019s now taking on even more responsibilities realising the company\u2019s various productions.\n\nAs if Feige wasn\u2019t already busy enough, Deadline reports that going forward, he will act as Marvel\u2019s chief creative officer and lead all of Marvel\u2019s film and television projects, meaning that both big and small screen productions will all be overseen by the same man \u2014 whether they are live-action, animation, streaming, or on network TV.\n\nThe move is also unrelated to the comics wing of Marvel, which is still operated by editor-in-chief C.B. Cebulski. The report mentioned the recent news of Feige working on a Star Wars project but didn\u2019t seem to have anything new to add there.\n\nOther corporate power players like Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Permutter and president Dan Buckley still work at the company, but Feige\u2019s new role is a reflection of the prominence he\u2019s taken on at Marvel now that the studio\u2019s third phase of films over and done with.\n\nDeadline says, \u201cFeige continues to report to Walt Disney Co-Chairman and Chief Creative Officer Alan Horn and Co-Chairman Alan Bergman,\u201d while THR adds, \u201cIt is unclear what this new structure means for Marvel\u2019s current head of TV, Jeph Loeb.\u201d\n\nThe trade adds, \u201cBuckley will have a dual reporting structure going forward, Deadline hears. He will continue to oversee publishing creative/editorial and in that capacity he will now report to Feige. Buckley is also responsible for publishing operations, sales, creative services, games, licensing and events. There, he will report to Perlmutter. It is expected that Joe Quesada will remain a creative lead for of Marvel Entertainment, reporting to Buckley. It is expected that all the creative execs in publishing will report to Buckley.\u201d\n\nDisney+ isn\u2019t just going to be the home for a number of new series set in the MCU; those stories are a big part of how the studio\u2019s been trying to drive interest in the platform. Marvel knows that it can only churn out so many superhero movies in a single year before audiences get burned out, and Disney+ provides the perfect opportunity to give people another avenue back into the world the Avengers have saved over and over again.\n\nDisney seems confident that the same vision that made Feige the ideal person to craft the MCU will continue to help make the fictional universe even more interesting in the future. Let\u2019s hope that Feige\u2019s got a plan to prove that\u2019s very much the case.", "description": "With the launch of Disney\u2019s new streaming platform right around the corner, there\u2019s been a bit of a structural change over at the House of Mouse.
