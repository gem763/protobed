But there was little in Boris Johnson\u2019s closing speech today to suggest agreement with the EU is possible. The prospect is receding.\n\nJohnson spoke the language of \u201ccompromise\u201d, citing his proposal for Northern Ireland to align with EU single market rules. But he knew full well his \u201cfinal offer\u201d could only be an opening bid if any real progress is to be made. He knows his insistence on customs checks on the island of Ireland, even if away from the border, crosses a thick red line for the EU. The early reaction from Brussels was negative.\n\nWatching the speech here in Manchester, and reflecting on the unjustified optimism of ministers, I concluded that, while Johnson wants a deal, he probably knows he is unlikely to get one. But he wants to show voters he has tried hard for an agreement. Allies hope this will help him to portray Brussels as obstructionist and unreasonable when he tries to justify no-deal, perhaps in an election campaign. Brussels will share responsibility in the \u201cblame game\u201d with parliament \u2013 a target for ridicule in Johnson\u2019s speech because it \u201crefuses to deliver Brexit, refuses to do anything constructive and refuses to have an election\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But scratch the surface during this conference, and you detected an undercurrent of anxiety about how Johnson will square the circle. He promises to leave \u201ccome what may\u201d but has also said he would obey the law. That now includes the Benn Act, requiring him to seek an extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership if no agreement is approved by 19 October.\n\nWhat Johnson could not tell his party members today, is that, while he might initially refuse to comply with the act, he might end up reluctantly seeking an extension after being ordered to do so by the courts. Another option \u2013 resign, let Jeremy Corbyn get the extension as prime minister, oust him and force an election \u2013 has been considered but looks less likely now. It\u2019s high risk, and might make Johnson look weak. An extension under duress, and adding the judiciary to the \u201cblame game\u201d cast in an election, seems to me to be the most likely scenario.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It was a tacit admission that his liberal credentials have been tarnished by Brexit.\n\nHis between-the-lines message was that normal One Nation service would be resumed once Brexit was finally resolved. He promised an \u201cimmense agenda\u201d to take the country forward. His defence of capitalism got a big cheer, but he coupled it with a declaration that the Tories are now \u201cthe party of the NHS\u201d. He does not share the view of some of his predecessors that the NHS is a Labour issue on which the Tories can never win. He reiterated his support for gay rights, his vision was for a country where \u201cprovided you obey the law and do no harm to others, you can live your life and love whomsoever you choose\u201d.\n\nModerate Tories have felt pretty marginalised at this conference, and fear his chasing of angry Leave voters will alienate long-standing centre-ground conservatives. Ryan Shorthouse, director of the liberal conservative Bright Blue think tank, warned after the speech that a no-deal exit could lose the Tories the support of millennials for a generation. They would not forgive the party, he said, like the working class communities hit by pit closures in the Thatcher era.\n\nSome of the 21 MPs who lost the whip for rebelling over a no-deal Brexit, such as David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Alistair Burt, spoke at fringe meetings. Many Tory MPs believe their expulsion was a huge mistake, sending a terrible signal to centre-ground voters. \u201cIt will cost some of us 1,000 votes,\u201d one MP told me. \u201cThose in very marginal seats can\u2019t afford that.\u201d\n\nRemoving the whip was hardly the act of a liberal prime minister who pledged during the Tory leadership election to unite his party and then the country. Brexit has changed Johnson. Its toxicity showed in his intemperate language in the Commons last week, and his apparent dismissal of female MPs\u2019 fears about the threats of violence against them.\n\nHis speech was an attempt to reassure Tory moderates that he is still one of them, that his aggressive stance on Brexit and alliance with the European Research Group is tactical and temporary. \u201cHe is not on the Eurosceptic right,\u201d one Tory moderate said. \u201cBut he has put himself in a position on Brexit where he now looks like he is.\u201d He hoped that \u201cwe will get our Boris back\u201d.\n\nHowever, that will depend on a Brexit endgame that no one can predict.
