Homes were destroyed and trees were uprooted as 11.7 million cubic meters of mud\u2014enough to fill 5,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools\u2014descended on the town and its surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nThe dam belonged to multinational mining giant Vale S.A., the largest iron ore producer in the world. It had used the dam to store mining waste, toxic to humans and animals. Later, investigations would show that the heads of Vale and executives from T\u00fcv S\u00fcd\u2014the German company hired to monitor the dam\u2014had known of its instability.\n\nThree weeks before the mudslide, far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro was sworn in as Brazil\u2019s president, after campaigning on tax cuts for big businesses; loosened mining restrictions; less government spending on environmental protection; and dismissals of human-caused climate change. Bolsonaro was applauded for traveling to Brumadinho immediately after the mudslide in January, but he hasn\u2019t returned since. Seven months later, 21 people remain missing, while the people of Brumadinho who survived remain angry, sad, and stunned.\n\nHere are some of their stories.", "description": "Multinational mining giant Vale S.A.'s dam near the Brazilian town of Brumadinho broke in January, flooding the area with toxic mudslides.
