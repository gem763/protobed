The Vikings gained 15 first downs in the game and did not score until the last three minutes when running back Dalvin Cook found the end zone.\n\nAs has been the case this season, Cousins missed big opportunities downfield and often resorted to checkdowns for minimal gains. Though some of that can be attributed to the Bears' fierce defense, Cousins has frequently been hesitant to take chances on the field and has missed open players; he has just three passing touchdowns.\n\nAfter the loss to the Bears, the Vikings star receiver Adam Thielen took as blatant a shot at his quarterback as a receiver ever will. Reflecting on Cousins missing him on a deep ball, Thielen said Cousins had to be able to make the throw.\n\n\"He made a great read of finding me open and just didn't complete the pass. It's as simple as that,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"At some point, you're not going to be able to run the ball for 180 yards, even with the best running back in the NFL. That's when you have to be able to throw the ball ... You have to be able to hit the deep balls.\"\n\nHere was the throw in question:\n\nCousins' poor play has plagued the Vikings other times this season. In Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, he threw a critical late interception that sealed the win for Green Bay.\n\nAmong many problems for the Vikings is that they have paid the trio of Cousins, Thielen, and Stefon Diggs handsomely, and they are not producing.\n\n\u2014Michael David Smith (@MichaelDavSmith) September 30, 2019\n\nDiggs and Thielen have combined for just 388 receiving yards this season. Last season, both players had 1,000-yard campaigns \u2014 but neither is on pace to hit 1,000 yards this year.\n\nCousins' record against winning teams is becoming problematic for Minnesota too. He's now 4-27 over his career against winning teams, something that doesn't bode well in a competitive NFC North.\n\nSigning Cousins to a three-year, $84 million, fully guaranteed contract was supposed to push the Vikings all in. In many ways, they are: Several key players are under contract through the 2020 season. If Cousins doesn't turn things around, however, they may have to explore their options.\n\nCousins. Abbie Parr/Getty\n\nAs ProFootballTalk's Mike Florio noted , the Vikings don't have an easy way to get out of the Cousins experience, as the money is guaranteed to him either way. However, the Vikings might have to pay a portion of his salary or give up a first-round pick if they want to trade him.\n\nIt's not as if the Vikings haven't seen \"Good Cousins\" before. In Weeks 1 through 8 last year, Cousins completed 70.7% of his passes for over 2,500 yards, with 16 touchdowns, four interceptions, and a 102.5 passer rating.\n\nThe Vikings began the year 6-6-1, however, and fired their offensive coordinator John DeFilippo. The returns under the new offensive coordinator, Kevin Stefanski, haven't been encouraging either, as an insistence on the run game hasn't helped anyone outside of Cook (and he too would probably benefit from a beefed-up pass game).\n\nOn paper, the Vikings boast one of the best teams in the NFL. If they can strike a balance between being a run-heavy team and finding what works for Cousins, they could reenter the contenders conversation in a seemingly wide-open NFC.\n\nThe Vikings next play the New York Giants, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Detroit Lions, the Washington Redskins, the Kansas City Chiefs, and the Dallas Cowboys.
