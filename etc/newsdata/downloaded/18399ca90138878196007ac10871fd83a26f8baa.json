How long?!\u201d wrote one exasperated Twitter user.\n\n\u201cI would like to hug you, hold you to me. Telling you that all is well. That you are important. That you are not wrong. Homophobia is the garbage of our society. Homophobia is barbarism. Homophobes are shit. We will defeat them together. By any means necessary,\u201d wrote another of the hundreds to comment.\n\nAfter investigating the case, local police found that there had indeed been an act of violence (as was evident from the video) but that it had nothing to do with homophobia.\n\nFor more than 12 hours the video bounced around social media (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) accompanied by the accusation: \u201cThis is the latest case of homophobia, he was beaten because he was gay,\u201d setting off an avalanche of protests and demands for justice.\n\nAccording to Cagliari police, however, the video as it was circulated amounted to \u201cfake news,\u201d since the two boys were fighting over a girl.\n\nMoreover, the event actually occurred last July, police said, and the two boys have long since reconciled. Authorities interviewed the boys as well as their parents, who believe their sons were victims of an ideological scam employed to advance an agenda at their expense.\n\nPolice have initiated an investigation into why the video was released three months after the fact in a context far from the reality of the situation. Although the images were filmed in a public place, officials have noted, they concern minors and would require consent from the parents for publication.\n\nArc Cagliari, a local chapter of a nationwide LGBT group, called the beating, a \u201cbrutal, shocking act meriting a strong response from institutions and civil society.\u201d\n\nThe association issued an urgent call for a law against homo-bi-transphobia, underscoring the need for \u201ca serious prevention of discrimination, which carries over into the correct use of social networks, because if the wounds of a fist can heal thanks to the care and support of the people around the victim; a viral video can last forever and risk becoming an eternal wound.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "A viral video in Italy showing the beating of a young boy with the caption \u201clatest case of homophobia\u201d has turned out to be fake news.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
