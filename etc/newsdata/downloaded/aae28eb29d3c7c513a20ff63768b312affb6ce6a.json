He chocked, and looks weak and pathetic. Don\u2019t want him at the White House! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe president has been eager to jump on any chance to deride NBA figures like Kerr or San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, both frequent critics of his administration, for a relatively timid response to the controversy generated by a pro-Hong Kong tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey.\n\nThe NBA, a league where basically every player and organization has seen an income boost thanks to the league\u2019s popularity in China, was initially quick to criticize Morey\u2019s tweet \u2014 which simply read \"Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\" \u2014 as \u201cdeeply\u201d offensive to the country\u2019s fans.\n\nPoliticians on both sides of the aisle have criticized the NBA\u2019s response as yielding to an authoritarian country on a human rights issue.\n\nPresident Trump and Warriors coach Steve Kerr's back-and-forth over China goes on. (Getty Images)\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong individual responses, Kerr\u2019s was notable given that a normally outspoken coach basically gave only an extended \u201cno comment.\u201d The Warriors are one of the most \u2014 if not the single most \u2014 popular teams in China, and any pro-Hong Kong statement from the coach would have likely seen a response to similar to that of Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nTrump has happily criticized NBA despite own reported promise to China\n\nTrump attacked Kerr\u2019s \u201cno comment\u201d about the Hong Kong protests and NBA response as \u201cscared\u201d and \u201clike a little boy.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump has been only laudatory of Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s handling of the matter after reportedly promising Xi that his administration would remain silent on the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nIf President Xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters, there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem. I have no doubt! https://t.co/eFxMjgsG1K \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 15, 2019\n\nAn unfazed Kerr said Thursday that he was only a \u201cshiny object\u201d for Trump to chase.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another one today, there\u2019ll be a new one tomorrow. The circus will go on,\u201d Kerr said.\n\nUndeterred, Trump still chose to needle Kerr again on Friday. It\u2019s yet another battle Trump has chosen to fight as he also deals with the ongoing House impeachment inquiry over his involvement into a Ukrainian investigation of the son of Joe Biden and his widely criticized decision to pull U.S. forces from northern Syria at the request of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, leaving Kurdish allies \u2014 and one U.S. military outpost \u2014 exposed to attacks from Turkish forces.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The president has been eager to criticize NBA figures for their response to the league's ongoing China controversy.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XdRqSVqrhDeIh.ea4Izc0Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NDIuNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bEZj7PmjJxR0Wb7m0_yBwA--~B/aD0zMzg0O3c9NTEzOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a756a990-ecae-11e9-97f2-2fc20bfeb55b", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
