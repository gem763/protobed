(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nWashington Redskins quarterback Case Keenum has an injured foot, and while the injury is not believed to be serious enough to keep him from starting in Sunday\u2019s game at the New York Giants, it represents another wrinkle in what is already a complex quarterback situation for the team.\n\nKeenum was in a walking boot Wednesday and didn\u2019t take part in the team\u2019s late-day walk-through. The injury occurred during Monday night\u2019s loss to the Chicago Bears, though no one seems to know exactly when.\n\n\u201cHe got tangled up a couple times,\u201d Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said Wednesday.\n\nGruden said the injury is not serious and doesn\u2019t think Keenum will miss any games, noting that the team is being cautious about the injury. But the quarterback\u2019s absence raised questions about who will be the Redskins\u2019 starting quarterback Sunday.\n\nIf Keenum can\u2019t go, will the starter be this year\u2019s first-round draft pick, Dwayne Haskins, whom many in the national media are calling for Gruden to start with the team off to an 0-3 start? Or will it be Colt McCoy, who participated in the walk-through Wednesday, returning for the first time since mid-August after having a setback in his recovery from three offseason leg surgeries?\n\n[The calls for the Redskins to start Dwayne Haskins are growing louder]\n\nWhen pressed on the subject during his Wednesday news conference, Gruden first said: \u201cRight now, it\u2019s Dwayne.\u201d\n\nLater, he said: \u201cObviously, if Case can\u2019t play, then the backup usually does play.\u201d\n\nBut will McCoy have passed Haskins by then?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chance that could happen. I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe just want to get through today. It was just a walk-through. Tomorrow we\u2019ll see where Case is. I assume Case will be able to play, he\u2019s a tough guy, and then we will be able to go with the \u2018ifs\u2019 tomorrow and Friday.\u201d\n\nGruden does not seem to want to play Haskins against the Giants on Sunday unless he must. While Redskins coaches have been excited about the rookie quarterback\u2019s development, they have also been careful to point out that he still has much to learn. Despite Keenum turning the ball over five times in Monday\u2019s loss to Chicago, Gruden was adamant after the game that he thinks Keenum, and not Haskins, gives the team the best opportunity to win.\n\nMcCoy knows Gruden\u2019s offense the best of any of the quarterbacks, having been with the coach for all six of Gruden\u2019s seasons in Washington. He seemed well positioned to win the starting job the first two weeks of camp, before the pain returned in his leg and he had to stop practicing.\n\nKeenum learned the offense quickly after being traded to the Redskins on March 13. He has thrown for 933 yards and seven touchdowns in the first three games but also had the five turnovers against Chicago after doing a good job of taking care of the ball the first two weeks.\n\nMcCoy has been working on the side, even throwing on the field before recent games. He has been anxious to return.\n\n\u201cWe have to see how he\u2019s feeling mentally and physically,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIf he\u2019s ready to go, I\u2019ll have to make that decision and I\u2019ll see where Dwayne is as far as the game plan prep is concerned. If I feel great about Dwayne and Case can\u2019t go we\u2019ll go with Dwayne, but we got a little ways to go before I make any crazy decisions.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re being overly protective of [Keenum\u2019s] foot right now.\"\n\nAlso missing Wednesday\u2019s practice were tight end Jordan Reed, who is still recovering from a concussion, and guard Brandon Scherff (ankle) and center Chase Roullier (knee). Gruden said he hopes that at least one of the injured linemen will be able to play Sunday.\n\nCornerback Quinton Dunbar and linebacker Cassanova McKinzy were listed as limited. The team signed tight end Jerome Cunningham, a former member of the Giants and Detroit Lions.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nJosh Norman is being picked on by opponents, and it\u2019s hurting the Redskins\n\nRedskins can\u2019t spell, stir correctly or win in another Monday night debacle\n\nAt 0-3, it\u2019s time to ask: What is this Redskins season even about?", "description": "Rookie Dwayne Haskins or Colt McCoy, who is returning from injury, would take his place as starter, although Keenum's injury is not expected to keep him out of Sunday's game versus Giants.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "September At Pm", "Les Carpenter Returned To The Washington Post In", "Writes About The Washington Redskins."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dvu9wopFcIZEFz2wV_jn171hhuo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FUFEW3G6PYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
