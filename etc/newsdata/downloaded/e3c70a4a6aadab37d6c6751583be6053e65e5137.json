The women \u2014 who hold the religious belief that marriage should be only between one man and one woman \u2014 do not want to design invitations or other custom artwork for LGBTQ couples because they believe it would be the equivalent of endorsing the marriage.\n\nThe women are represented by Scottsdale-based Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group challenging similar laws across the country.\n\nRecently, the group represented a Colorado baker facing penalty under that state's anti-discrimination law. The case landed before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018, but the justices punted on the key issues of the case.\n\nLegal experts say it's a matter of time until a similar challenge comes back before the U.S. Supreme Court. And given the Arizona Supreme Court's decision, it could be this case.\n\nWhat's the case about?\n\nThe case boils down to a balance between protecting free speech and preventing discrimination.\n\nDuring oral arguments in January, Alliance Defending Freedom attorney Jonathan Scruggs argued that the studio is not refusing to design invitations for same-sex couples because of their sexual orientation, but rather because of the message an invitation conveys.\n\nIn other words, designing their wedding invitations would be the equivalent of celebrating the marriage, which is a message the women do not want to express, he argued.\n\nScruggs said the women happily would sell their premade invitations to a same-sex couple, or help a same-sex couple design a custom art piece for their home. They just don't want to create materials that will be used in the celebration of a practice they don't condone.\n\nHe equated his argument to a Muslim designer declining to make Easter decorations, but still serving Christian customers with other services. He said business owners can serve all members of the community without celebrating things they disagree with.\n\nPhoenix's attorney, Eric M. Fraser, argued that it's not the message, but the customer that the women really take issue with.\n\nPhoenix's nondiscrimination ordinance has been on the books since 1964, but the City Council expanded it to protect against sexual orientation and gender identity bias in 2013.\n\nHe said Phoenix's law requires only that businesses provide the same services to all classes of people. Therefore, if the women would provide an invitation to an opposite-sex couple, it must produce an identical invitation for a same-sex couple.\n\nChanging the names to two male names or two female names does not constitute a change in message, Fraser argued.\n\nHe said that if someone calls the studio and asks the women to design an invitation for his or her wedding, and the women have to ask the sexes of the individuals getting married before consenting to provide the invitations, \"that's not about the message, that's about who the person is.\"\n\nBreanna Koski, co-owner of Brush and Nib Studio, speaks at a press conference after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled Breanna Koski and Joanna Duka do not have to create same sex wedding invitations.
