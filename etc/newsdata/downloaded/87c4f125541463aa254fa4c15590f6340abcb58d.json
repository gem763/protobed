My car was set on fire,\" said the portly man with a closely-trimmed white beard.\n\n- 'He made our lives hell' -\n\nUmm Alaa, an Iraqi woman dressed in a worn black robe, said Baghdadi \"made our lives hell.\"\n\n\"There's not a single house they didn't attack, not a single house they didn't oppress,\" she said.\n\n\"This is a festival, a festival for all Iraqis because he destroyed us,\" she added.\n\nIS kept Mosul in its grip for three years, until a ferocious offensive by US-backed Iraqi troops ousted the jihadists in 2017.\n\nBut the group left behind a horrifying legacy.\n\nMany of Mosul's neighbourhoods, particularly the historic Old City which was the last area to be retaken, remain in ruins.\n\nSlabs of concrete hang off destroyed and abandoned buildings like oversized hangnails.\n\nThe historic Al-Nuri Mosque stands gutted and covered in graffiti, while the adjacent ancient minaret -- long the city's symbol -- was blown up in the violence.\n\nMany residents have yet to return because their houses remain littered with unexploded ordnance or are damaged beyond habitation.\n\nThere are some 200 mass graves across the country where the remains of thousands of suspected IS victims have yet to be identified.\n\nSeveral thousand people from the Yazidi minority are still missing, five years after IS ravaged their heartland near Mosul.\n\nBashar Hussam, 31, survived life under IS -- unlike his father.\n\n\"My father had a blood clot and they didn't let us leave until he died in front of my own eyes,\" Hussam said.\n\nWhile glad to see Baghdadi perish, he said it was not quite the happy ending he had hoped for.\n\n\"We want the other good news -- that they rebuild our houses, that we go back to work and to our livelihoods.\"", "description": "In June 2014, Baghdadi climbed a set of stairs at the Al-Nuri Mosque in the northern Iraqi city and declared himself \"caliph\" over millions of people in Iraq and Syria.
