Yeah, not bothered (Picture: Ella Byworth)\n\nMindfulness is all about being present and living in the moment. It can help to relieve anxiety and worry by altering your perspective.\n\nIt basically says that thinking about your breathing, and the colour of the sky is better for you than spiralling into panic about the 800 unopened emails in your inbox. Which makes sense.\n\nA new study has found that the practice could also be the key to overcoming our deepest fears and phobias.\n\nWhen you think of treatment for phobias you probably think of hypnotherapy or exposure therapy \u2013 you know, the one where if you\u2019re scared of heights they make you go and hang out on top of the Eiffel Tower until you\u2019re not scared anymore.\n\nMindfulness tips Take time to notice your breathing and feel the air flowing in and out with the rise and fall of your abdomen. If your mind wanders to thinking, gently bring it back to focusing on the breath. When doing an activity, notice what you are doing, tune into your senses. Notice how things smell, how they taste, listen to the sounds. If you\u2019re eating, feel the texture and the taste. Slow down if necessary. Pay particular attention to activities when you tend to zone out, like driving, brushing your teeth or doing the dishes. Really bring your attention to these tasks, and when your mind wanders, bring your attention back to what\u2019s coming in through your senses. Remember, thoughts are just thoughts, you do not need to believe them or react to them.
