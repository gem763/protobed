In what is a long and punishing two-month campaign, players tend make the most of any time off to let body and mind heal.\n\nBut for England, this World Cup feels very different. After two relatively low-key matches in four days against Tonga and the USA, they have subsequently had nine-day and 14-day breaks between matches \u2013 two games in the space of 23 days. It is unheard of at this stage of the tournament.\n\nThe problem this causes is that while the squad will head into the knockout stage as fresh as they possibly can be, they risk not being in the right frame of mind to hit the ground running. Mentally, they could be severely undercooked to face Australia this Saturday.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis sounds all rather lovely, were it the itinerary for a fan in Japan and not a 31-man squad that already has questions lingering over its mental resilience, in particular in the biggest matches that now lie ahead.\n\nAnd this is where the impact of Typhoon Hagibis on rugby matters alone are much bigger than first thought. Eddie Jones was initially delighted to see their game against France called off, suggesting the \u201ctyphoon Gods\u201d were smiling down on his team. But below the surface, it has cost him the chance to test out a number of scenarios that needed looking at. Is Owen Farrell a better player at fly-half? Can Mako Vunipola start a match or does he need more fitness work? Who\u2019s the better No 8 out of Mark Wilson and Tom Curry if Billy Vunipola doesn\u2019t recover in time to face the Wallabies.\n\nThese are all questions that should have been answered against France, but weren\u2019t.\n\nOn the flip side, Australia are battle-hardened, in good health and fired up by a six-game losing streak against England. Heck, Michael Cheika may actually fall on a first-choice fly-half out of Bernard Foley, Christian Lealiifano and Matt Toomua this week, but then England can hardly bleat on about consistency at No 10.\n\nThat\u2019s because whether he wants it or not, Jones is now stuck with George Ford, with Farrell outside him. That is in no way a barb aimed at Ford, who has been England\u2019s most impressive performer in Japan so far. It is more a reflection that despite dropping Ford from the first team nearly a year ago and only reinstating him in August, Jones doesn\u2019t really know how playing at centre is affecting Farrell and the ball distributed to those outside him. What he would\u2019ve been desperate to see is how a Farrell-Piers Francis-Henry Slade partnership would\u2019ve run against the French, which the Australian was set to deploy in \u2018Le Crunch\u2019 before it was called off. Without knowing his options in game mode, how can Jones trust anything other than Ford-Farrell and Manu Tuilagi from the start of Saturday\u2019s quarter-final, rather than slotting Tuilagi between that Farrell-Slade pairing?\n\n\u201cWe all get a role in a particular week, whatever that is,\u201d Ford said on Monday. \u201cFrom a backline point of view we have unbelievable options: Sladey, Piers, Manu, Jonathan Joseph in the midfield, who will be given a role each week. You get told pretty early in the week what your role is and you try and fulfil that as well as you can. Whoever Eddie picks we are confident can go out and do a job.\u201d\n\nIt means that this week\u2019s preparations in Beppu, a few minutes north of Oita where England face Australia, are even more important than meets the eye. This is not just any Test week for England, this is a quarter-final Test week that all but four members of the squad have not experienced before. There are two options in how to address this: embrace and build the atmosphere within the camp throughout the week, or strip out all the importance and play it as if it\u2019s \u2018just another game\u2019 in order to focus on the small things that makes up a complete performance.\n\nEvidently, England are going for the latter.\n\n\u201cLook, we understand it\u2019s a quarter-final but our approach as players is the same as any other game, any other week,\u201d Ford added. \u201cWe want to just focus on the next thing and not look too far into the future, because we feel if we get our preparation right \u2013 which is being in the moment, give each session as much as we can in terms of enthusiasm, energy getting our detail right \u2013 then we\u2019ll be in a great spot for Saturday.\n\n\u201cNothing changes in terms of that. It\u2019s a one-off Test match against Australia to look forward to.\u201d\n\nBoth Billy Vunipola and Jack Nowell are yet to return to full training as they continue to be managed back from ankle and hamstring injuries respectively, though England have not ruled them out of this weekend\u2019s encounter. Hatley said: \u201cThey have been involved in different aspects of training, in the gym and a little bit of breakdown in the gym as well. Jack was out doing some running this morning, and we will make a decision over the next few days.\u201d", "description": "In the slog of a Rugby World Cup, breaks along the way are usually very welcome.
