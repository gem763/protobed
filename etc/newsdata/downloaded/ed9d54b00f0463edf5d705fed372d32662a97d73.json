In a Twitter post today, team member Casey Chambers stated that the team has been banned from competitive play for six months.\n\nThe situation started last week when pro player Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai spoke in support of Hong Kong citizens currently embroiled in months-long protest with the government. During a livestream of the Hearthstone Asia-Pacific Grandmasters, Blitzchung called for a liberated Hong Kong and a \u201crevolution of our age.\u201d\n\nAs a result, he was initially banned from competitive play for 12 months and had his prize money revoked. The decision sparked immediate outcry against Blizzard, including demonstrations from workers on Blizzard\u2019s campus in Irvine, California. Blitzchung\u2019s suspension has since been reduced to six months and his prize money returned.\n\nLater that week, American University\u2019s three-player Hearthstone demonstrated in their own way, by holding up a sign that said \u201cFREE HONG KONG, BOYCOTT BLIZZ\u201d during a match. When a punishment from Blizzard to similar to Blitzchung\u2019s was not forthcoming, the team voluntarily dropped out of future tournaments. Now, they\u2019ve been officially banned for half a year.\n\nChambers posted an image of an email from Blizzard on their Twitter today. It reads:\n\n\u201cEvery Voice Matters at Blizzard and we strongly encourage everyone in our community to share their viewpoints in the many places available to express themselves. However, the official broadcast needs to be about the game and competition, and to be a place where all are welcome.\u201d\n\nThe email goes on to state that Chambers violated a rule regarding sportsmanship and that he is banned from competition for six months from the incident.\n\n\u201cHappy to announce the AU Hearthstone team received a six month ban from competition,\u201d Chambers tweeted. \u201cWhile delayed I appreciate all players being treated equally and no one being above the rules.\u201d\n\nIn the time since Blitzchung\u2019s ban, pressure has mounted against Blizzard from fans disappointed with a slow response to the incident. Eventually, Blizzard president J. Allen Brack released a statement insisting that the content of Blitzchung\u2019s message played no factor in disciplinary decisions, and that it was a result of breaking a general rule that states the company can punish players for \u201cengaging in any act that, in Blizzard\u2019s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\u201d\n\nKotaku has reached out to Blizzard for comment.", "description": "American University Hearthstone players who recently held up a sign calling for Hong Kong\u2019s freedom during a livestream have been officially disciplined by Activision-Blizzard.
