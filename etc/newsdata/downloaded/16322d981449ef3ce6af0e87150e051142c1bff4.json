Earlier, it weakened as far as 5.7575.\n\n\"While the statement from the United States gives a green light to the military operation in Syria that Turkey has mentioned for a long time, it leaves many question marks regarding how the process will develop,\" said a forex trader, who did not want to be named.\n\nTurkey's lira lost nearly 30% against the dollar in a currency crisis last year, sparked by concerns over political interference with monetary policy, as well as a deterioration in ties between Washington and Ankara. It is down some 8% this year.\n\nTurkey's BIST100 main share index was down 0.78%, while the banking index declined 1.06%.
