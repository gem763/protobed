Obviously I wanted to go and find these people.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nParents Leanne and Scott Gavin were disgusted by the sick comments (Picture: Scott Gavin)\n\nLittle Megan Gavin with the family\u2019s massive pet dog (Picture: Scott Gavin)\n\n\u2018But after a few hours of sitting down and thinking, I thought I\u2019m not going to let some idiot make me angry and ruin my baby\u2019s day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So I\u2019ve turned it into a positive thing and decided from now on I\u2019m going to educate the uneducated idiots.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m going to share the love and I\u2019ll do that by sharing pictures of Megan.\u2019\n\nScott won \u00a326,000 on the Great British Benefit Handout television show in 2017, and used the money to transform his home into a mini-zoo and set up his own business called Party Central Entertainments.\n\nThe father-of-six said he often shows exotic animals to children with special needs and hears similar shocking stories of online abuse from other parents.\n\nHe added: \u2018We hear it all the time from the mums, it\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\nLittle Megan turned one last week (Picture: Scott Gavin)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t understand why people see them differently. I don\u2019t understand it.\u2019\n\nScott says hate crimes against people with disabilities are getting \u2018worse and worse\u2019 because \u2018prosecution levels are down\u2019.\n\nEarlier this year disability charity Leonard Cheshire found recorded incidents of hate crimes against disabled people had gone up by almost a third (33 per cent) between 2016/17 and 2017/18.\n\nDespite the number of reported hate crimes going up, only six per cent of cases were prosecuted, which is down from eight per cent the previous year.\n\nThe charity also surveyed disabled people and found 70 per cent of those who had experienced hate crimes online were targeted through Facebook.\n\nMore than one in five victims (22 per cent) said it happened via email.\n\nMegan Gavin with her older brothers and sisters (Picture: Scott Gavin)\n\nWorryingly, 36 per cent of victims told nobody at all about the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeonard Cheshire\u2019s chief executive Neil Heslop warned the incidents could be the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHe said: \u2018Police are increasingly recording online offences, but we know it remains an under reported area and that disabled people may have reservations about speaking out.\n\n\u2018We suspect many crimes remain under the radar, with survivors never getting support and perpetrators facing no consequences.\n\n\u2018These offences can have a devastating impact on the lives of survivors.\n\n\u2018We know from our work with disabled people that hate crime causes long-term fear, anxiety and in some cases, isolation.\n\n\u2018Advocacy services that support disability hate crime survivors, like the one our charity provides in Northern Ireland, are a lifeline and enable us to work closely with police and upskill them in this area.\n\n\u2018Such services should be rolled out across the UK.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
