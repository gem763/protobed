REUTERS/Phil Noble/\n\nThe Australian and New Zealand dollars, AUD=D3NZD=D3 Chinese yuan CNY= and South Korean won KRW= all jumped against the dollar, while the yen JPY=EBS fell nearly 0.4% to 106.75 per dollar, its cheapest in more than three weeks.\n\nThe early-October talks will be held in Washington, China\u2019s commerce ministry announced, following a phone call between China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.\n\nThe news followed optimism that a no-deal Brexit could be avoided, which sent the pound GBP=D3 sharply higher, and a potential breakthrough for the Hong Kong political crisis.\n\nThose political developments, seen as positive for investment, also fueled a jump in Asian equities and bond yields.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen markets hold up relatively well overnight, this (trade) news has injected a fair amount of optimism in markets,\u201d said Prashant Newnaha, senior rates strategist at TD Securities in Singapore.\n\n\u201cIt does seem that the markets were positioning more bearishly, and now we\u2019ve gotten this potential good news and the markets are running with it,\u201d he said, adding global economic indicators had also recently been showing some green shoots.\n\nThe Australian dollar rose to a one-month high of $0.6825, seen as a technical resistance level while the New Zealand dollar hit a one-week peak of $0.6377. The trade-exposed won climbed the most of Asia\u2019s currencies to 1198.00 per dollar.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar .DXY lifted a little from a one-week low to 98.492.\n\nThe Canadian dollar CAD= spiked sharply to C$1.3344 per dollar after the Bank of Canada left interest rates on hold and sounded less dovish than the market had expected.\n\nThe pound sat around $1.2245 and euro EUR=EBS at $1.1030, holding overnight gains.\n\nThey had climbed after British parliament voted on Wednesday to prevent Johnson from taking Britain out of the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31, but rejected his first bid to call a snap election two weeks before the scheduled exit.\n\nThat still leaves Brexit up in the air, with possible outcomes ranging from a no-deal exit to abandoning the whole endeavor, prompting some to sound a note of caution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that the situation continues to look pretty bad,\u201d J.P. Morgan analysts reminded investors in a market note, pointing out that Johnson, a staunch Brexiteer, leads opinion polls.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that a hard Brexit has, for now, been removed as an immediate risk gave markets some cheer, as did Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam\u2019s move to withdraw the bill that triggered months of violent protests in the city.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no \u2018all clear\u2019 on market concerns, investor sentiment pulled back from extremes...the deferral of a no-deal Brexit, soothed nerves,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.", "description": "Risk-sensitive currencies such as the Aussie and yuan rallied on Thursday as investors cheered the announcement of U.S.-China trade talks for next month and abandoned safe haven assets such as yen.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426354372&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8402T"}
