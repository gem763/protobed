This view is shared by all donors,\" Duquesne said.\n\nHe was also critical of how some Lebanese politicians were approaching the urgency of the economic problems in the country.\n\n\"There are some people still believe that there is a miracle solution, a magical solution to solve all the problems. This does not exist.\"\n\n\"Time is running out and we cannot continue with the endless debates,\" he added.\n\nOn Monday Lebanese politicians declared a \"state of economic emergency\". Hariri said the government would take emergency measures to speed up reforms, including holding more meetings.", "description": "Lebanon PM Hariri: France says satisfied with investment plan progress", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF85126_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
