Apple CEO Tim Cook today credited the Trump administration for the company\u2019s decision to keep assembling the Mac Pro in Texas.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe thank the administration for their support enabling this opportunity,\u201d Cook said in a statement.\n\nIn June, media reports indicated Apple was weighing whether to move manufacturing of the Mac Pro to China. A month later, Trump slammed Apple on Twitter for building products outside the U.S. and said the company would not receive relief from tariffs. He later walked back those comments.\n\nApple described the decision to keep Mac Pro production in Austin as part of its \u201ccommitment to US economic growth.\u201d The company said the Mac Pro includes parts from more than a dozen U.S. companies as well as those from global suppliers.\n\nCook has emerged as one of Apple\u2019s most effective lobbyists, speaking directly to Trump and his close advisers about issues like taxes and tariffs.
