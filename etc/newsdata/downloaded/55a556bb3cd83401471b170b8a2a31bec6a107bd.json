REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nFrance and Germany have said that Libra, whose size would dwarf cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, could limit their monetary sovereignty.\n\n\u201cEurope needs a common approach on crypto-assets such as Libra,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis told EU lawmakers in a confirmation hearing. \u201cI intend to propose new legislation on this.\u201d\n\nThe EU has no specific regulations on cryptocurrencies, which, until Libra was announced in June, had been considered a marginal issue by most decision-makers because only a fraction of bitcoins or other digital coins are converted into euros.\n\nDombrovskis has resisted regulating digital currencies in the five years he has served so far. He made it clear his change of heart stemmed from Facebook\u2019s plans for Libra, a digital currency that \u201ccould have systemic effects on financial stability,\u201d he told lawmakers.\n\nThe EU is now also pushing the G20 for global action on \u201cstablecoins,\u201d an EU document circulated last week said.\n\nFacebook\u2019s planned Libra is the best-known of the stablecoins - cryptocurrencies backed by assets such as conventional money deposits, short-term government securities or gold.\n\nLibra\u2019s scale would pose risks, Dombrovskis said, because Facebook\u2019s millions of users in Europe would be able to pay with the new digital currency.\n\nAn EU Commission official said there was no timetable yet for proposing the new rules.\n\nDombrovskis said the crypto regulation should focus on defending financial stability, protecting consumers and tackling the risks of money-laundering using crypto-assets, which can easily cross borders.\n\nDombrovskis, a former prime minister of Latvia, said the EU needed to rethink its defenses against financial crime. He also said he saw \u201ca lot of merit\u201d in shifting some supervision to an EU body, without clarifying whether that meant setting up a new anti-money-laundering agency or beefing up existing agencies.\n\nIn his address to lawmakers, Dombrovskis also pledged a \u201csustainable Europe investment plan\u201d to unlock 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) of private and public green investment over the next decade.\n\nHe said the plan would be based on guarantees and funds provided by the EU budget and the European Investment Bank, although most of the money is expected to come from the private sector.", "description": "The European Union's finance commissioner pledged on Tuesday to propose new rules to regulate virtual currencies, in a reaction to Facebook's plans to introduce Libra, which the EU considers a risk to financial stability.", "authors": ["Francesco Guarascio", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438383398&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970EL", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
