It was a combination of \u201cAre you kidding, not another injury?\u201d and \u201cLet this not be serious.\u201d\n\nIt was serious \u2014 Thompson had torn his ACL. He will be out for much of this coming season rehabbing, until some time after the All-Star break (and likely into March). It will take longer than that for Thompson to return to his old self.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe injury happened just weeks before Thomspon would be a free agent. The injury did not change the Warriors plans, they still offered him a five-year, $190 million max contract. The idea of not re-signing Thompson never crossed the Warriors\u2019 mind, team co-owner Joe Lacob said to NBC Sports Bay Area\u2019s Monte Poole on \u201cThe Warriors Insider Podcast.\u201d (Transcription via NBC Sports Bay Area.)\n\n\u201cThere was no doubt in my mind, whatsoever (they would resign Thompson). I, and we, want Klay to be here for a long time. He\u2019s one of my favorite players in the world\u2026 \u201cACLs \u2026 not good, ok we know that. But stuff happens and that\u2019s an injury that now people know how to manage. Plenty of people have come back from ACLs and done pretty well. Honestly, it didn\u2019t even remotely cross my mind.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Warriors have bet on Thompson\u2019s return to form keeping Golden State as contenders going forward for years. They re-signed Thompson, extended Draymond Green, and still have Stephen Curry under contract. While Kevin Durant is in Brooklyn (and will play for them in a year following his recovery from his Achilles tear), the Warriors added All-Star D'Angelo Russell, who will either work out in a three-guard lineup for the team or be traded for a player who is a better fit (the Warriors are going to give this every chance to work before thinking trade).\n\nThere are two parts to players returning from a torn ACL: Physically getting well enough to play again, and mentally trusting that knee the same way and playing without hesitation again. The mental part takes longer. Thompson should get there, but it will take some time.\n\nEven with that, the Warriors see themselves as part of the mix in a very deep Western Conference. They can be if everything goes their way, but the days of the Warriors having a margin for error and still winning big are gone.", "description": "\"I, and we, want Klay to be here for a long time.
