'I think all that was needed is for youngsters to get an opportunity.\n\n'For too long we've had players who've reached a ceiling in development that they can't get through because they don't get the chance.\n\n'What's happened at Chelsea is a great example of a team having to use young players and actually, they're not bad.\n\n'It's certainly made people think differently, there's been a shift, because players are doing so well. The Premier League's top scorer is an Englishman - and it's not Harry Kane, it's Tammy Abraham, a young player who's taken the chance he's been given.'\n\nBoothroyd watched Callum Hudson-Odoi's first game for Chelsea after five months out\n\nBoothroyd watched Hudson-Odoi's comeback game after five months out with an Achilles injury during the 7-1 thumping of Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup last month.\n\nThe 18-year-old scored that night and has recorded three assists in the subsequent trio of games for Frank Lampard this term.\n\nBoothroyd added: 'I was sat there thinking, \"Right, have you lost any of your speed?\" He's then flying past three or four people. Great, because that was a worry when you get an injury like that.\n\n'We're almost part of his rehab really, to get him back to that place where he can challenge for a senior place.\n\n'We only had him for about half an hour last time (in March). He was having his dinner and before he'd finished the starter we had to send him back up to Gareth! It was nice to spend a few more hours with him.'", "description": "Aidy Boothroyd applauded Premier League clubs for finally waking up to the talents of England's youngsters.
