Other components, including a proxy for business investment, were softer, however. Here are the key takeaways from the report:\n\n-Orders for durable goods--products designed to last at least three years, such as computers and machinery-increased 0.2% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted $250.67 billion in August, the Commerce Department said Friday.\n\n-Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 1% drop in the month.\n\n-Orders for July were up an unrevised 2% from June.\n\n-Compared with August 2018, demand for durable products was down 4.2%.\n\n-A closely watched proxy for business investment, new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, fell 0.2% in August from July to $69.3 billion. It was down 1.7% from August 2018.\n\n-Friday's report showed orders for defense aircraft and parts surging 30% in August from July, helping to keep overall durable-goods orders positive even as orders for civilian aircraft fell.\n\n-The Commerce Department's durable goods orders report can be found at http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3.\n\nWrite to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com and Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
