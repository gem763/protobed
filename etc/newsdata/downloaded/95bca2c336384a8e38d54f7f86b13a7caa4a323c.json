He\u2019s known for being a vehement Never Trumper, but what he\u2019s really known for is being a vehement Never Trumper while married to a top Trump aide. (Peter Foley/EPA-EFE/REX; Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nI\u2019m beginning to wonder whether George and Kellyanne Conway have enlisted us all into a private fetish \u2014 a relationship-spicing exercise defined by mutual debasement and public shame. We now know too much about the marriage between two prominent conservatives. Not the nitty-gritty of who snores and who loads the dishwasher wrong, but the vast cosmic business, like who has apparently lost all semblance of respect for whose lifelong wedded partner.\n\nGeorge Conway, according to the succinct bio accompanying the essays he publishes in national media sharply criticizing the Trump administration, is \u201ca lawyer in New York.\u201d Which is true, but this description is like calling George W. Bush \u201ca painter with an exhibit at the Kennedy Center.\u201d Also true, weirdly, but that\u2019s not why anybody\u2019s buying tickets.\n\nGeorge Conway is known for being a vehement Never Trumper, but what he\u2019s really known for is being the husband of Kellyanne Conway. Who is herself a senior counselor to President Trump.\n\nGeorge has become the toast of the resistance. Not because of what he says; scores of learned experts have spent the past three years furiously penning similar arguments. He has become the toast of the resistance mostly because we know who his wife is. He\u2019s riding her coattails while on an apparent mission that would, ultimately, put her out of a job. Which makes the whole thing more . . . diabolical? More squalid? More delicious?\n\n\u201cThere is a cancer in the presidency,\u201d George wrote in April; in June he described one of Trump\u2019s briefs as \u201cspectacularly anti-constitutional.\u201d He seemed to peak in July, calling his wife\u2019s boss \u201cracist,\u201d as well as \u201cboorish, dim-witted, inarticulate, incoherent, narcissistic and insensitive.\u201d Then, last week he hit a new apex with a massive, 12,000-word piece in the Atlantic, whose scathing contents, while weaving the articles of the Constitution into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, could be boiled down to the story\u2019s title: \u201cUnfit for Office.\u201d\n\nOn a sweeping historical level, these are shocking things for a conservative to publicly say about a sitting GOP president. On a personal level \u2014 they\u2019re shocking things for someone to publicly say about his wife\u2019s boss. The behaviors and worldviews Conway denounces are the very behaviors and worldviews that his wife spends her waking hours shaping and enabling. The regime he finds abhorrent is the regime his wife, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, worked to build.\n\nCan you imagine? I\u2019m not saying whose perspective is right (George\u2019s is right), I\u2019m just saying that if many of us publicly insulted our wives\u2019 bosses that way, either we wouldn\u2019t have wives, or our wives wouldn\u2019t have bosses.\n\nBut there they are, George and Kellyanne and Donald, staggering on in their bizarre throuple through various circles of perdition: Trump calls George \u201ca husband from hell.\u201d Kellyanne goes on Fox News, again, to defend Trump. George tweets about Trump\u2019s \u201cnarcissism and sociopathy.\u201d\n\nAnd then! Last weekend, Kellyanne\u2019s cousin married Vice President Pence\u2019s nephew, and \u2014 cheers to the happy couple \u2014 the Conways attended the wedding together.\n\nMassive, 12,000-word stories in major magazines don\u2019t come out of nowhere; they take weeks to produce. Does that mean George spent weeks feverishly hiding his activities from his life partner? Or does that mean he was coming home every night and giving Kellyanne blow-by-blows, gloating about the new insults he\u2019d created to denigrate her life\u2019s work? If Kellyanne knew, did she tell the president? And then what happened?\n\nThese are the Conways-at-home scenarios I find myself actively imagining. What are their specific pathologies? How can either of them stay married to to the other? This isn\u2019t James Carville and Mary Matalin; this is \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d Is it this all part of an act \u2014 a long con for a co-authored book deal? Why can\u2019t we look away?\n\nThe tawdriness of watching George Conway drag Trump through the mud gets at so much of our psychology these days. It\u2019s the proof that, yes, politics really are ripping families apart. It\u2019s the validation, for liberals, that someone within Trump\u2019s tribe is willing to call him a fraud. It\u2019s the sense, for conservatives, that some people really do care more about stopping Trump than they care about anything else.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the shame. I think, for the people who have \u201cGeorge Conway\u201d on a Google news alert, who eagerly wait to see what he\u2019s going to say next, what they\u2019re really savoring is the imagined shame of it all, traveling from George through Kellyanne to Donald Trump. Here is a president who seems not to feel shame but who does seem to fear, more than anything else, appearing weak or emasculated.\n\nWe\u2019re watching not a love triangle but six or seven of them.\n\nGeorge, cheating on Kellyanne with his democratic principles.\n\nKellyanne, torn between a domestic partner and a professional one.\n\nAmerica, wondering what George might know that we don\u2019t and how this will end, and what\u2019s going to happen in one or five years when this administration is over and we all have to look at each other again, asking ourselves, Is that what you thought of me? Now that I know that, can we ever go back?\n\nAnd the president of the United States impotent and metaphorically cuckolded on a regular basis, as his trusted adviser\u2019s spouse spanks him on Twitter.\n\nMonica Hesse is a columnist writing about gender and its impact on society.
