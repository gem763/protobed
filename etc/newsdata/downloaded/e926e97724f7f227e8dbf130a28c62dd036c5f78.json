Perhaps that's why the Pentagon location got only 3.5 out of five stars on Google Maps.\n\n\"I found a missile in my ice cream. will NOT be back,\" wrote a local guide named Quinn, who was one of 18 critics to publish their thoughts on the shop.\n\nOne ice cream critic used Google Translate to write \"A good establishment, but the impression is spoiled by some tasteless pentagonal building in the neighborhood,\" in both English and Russian. Four stars.\n\nThe image of Paul Rudd/Scott Lang/Ant-Man isn't the only unusual photo gracing the Google Maps page of a Pentagon-based fast food chain. Click on the Panda Express there and you'll find a photo uploaded this month by user Bruh Bruhov of somebody holding what appears to be a dead fish over a flat wooden surface.\n\nThe Google Maps photo shenanigans continue at KFC, where several young men have left striking self-portraits over the past two years.\n\nIn our opinion, the award for most impressive gallery of Google Maps images at a fast food chain at the Pentagon goes to one of its Subway Restaurants locations. The portfolio there includes a Mr. Krabs in powered armor, and an image of \"Communism Man\" claiming that communism is good for weight loss.\n\n\"Are you SO bored that you're reading through Subway reviews at the Pentagon??,\" wrote McMc in a particularly portentous five-star review last year.\n\nYes, McMc. Yes I am.", "description": "The Pentagon is among the most heavily-fortified office buildings on the planet.
