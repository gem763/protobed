But it remains unclear if Beijing will yield to economic pressure.\n\nOnce again, President Donald Trump has bent over backward to give China the chance to the do the right thing on trade. And once again, China is likely to spurn the opportunity.\n\nLast week, China agreed to make concessions to the United States on protecting intellectual property, adopting currency and foreign exchange \u201ctransparency,\u201d opening its markets to U.S. financial services, and buying up to $50 billion in American farm products.\n\nIn exchange, the Trump administration put off a planned increase in existing tariffs on Chinese imports. A big increase in tariffs is still scheduled for December 15, especially if the Chinese don\u2019t follow through as details are put on paper.\n\nTrump deserves enormous credit for forcing China to make concessions while still preserving tariffs on about half of what we import from China, which are part of a new reality that is driving business and investment away from our chief adversary in the world. Gone are the days when Wall Street could ship American manufacturing jobs to China without a care in the world. Trump has also proved again how tariffs are an effective tool of U.S. statecraft.\n\nBut it is important to keep in mind that the Chinese government will probably mess this up. The reason: some governments just cannot be trusted to keep their word.\n\nIndeed, China\u2019s historical conduct brings to mind a passage about the former German government from Albert Speer\u2019s book, Inside the Third Reich. Referencing Adolf Hitler\u2019s foreign minister, Speer wrote: \u201cFor Ribbentrop\u2019s fiftieth birthday in 1943 several of his close associates presented him with a handsome casket, ornamented with semi-precious stones, which they intended to fill with photocopies of all the treaties and agreements concluded by the Foreign Minister. \u2018We were thrown into great embarrassment,\u2019 Ambassador Hewel, Ribbentrop\u2019s liaison man, remarked to Hitler at supper, \u2018when we were about to fill the casket. There were only a few treaties that we hadn\u2019t broken in the meantime.\u2019 Hitler\u2019s eyes filled with tears of laughter.\u201d\n\nExamples of communist China\u2019s similar flexibility with adhering to its agreements are easy to find. For example, the Chinese government broke virtually all of the major pledges it made when it was accepted into the World Trade Organization in 2001, including agreements to respect intellectual property, not discriminate against non-Chinese companies, and reform its legal system.\n\nThe Chinese government broke a pledge to Great Britain and the people of Hong Kong to respect the former colony\u2019s relative autonomy after its handover, and progress toward democracy with universal suffrage by 2012. We\u2019re seeing the result of those broken promises on the streets of Hong Kong today as citizens from all walks of life protest.\n\nIn 2016, Chinese president Xi Jinping promised former President Barack Obama that Beijing would not militarize the South China Sea. Shortly thereafter, China did just that, installing missile systems and other material on islands it constructed in the economically important waterway.\n\nXi also promised Obama that the Chinese government would cease cyber attacks to steal U.S. government and corporate information. It made for a nice photo op, but Beijing never stopped this misconduct and it continues to this day.\n\nNumerous other examples abound. In fact, it\u2019s hard to find a trade a security-related promise that Beijing has kept. When America and other countries with the rule of law sign agreements, they become solemn promises and have the force of law. For China and other authoritarian governments, they are mere gestures\u2014often insincere ones.\n\nWhat does this behavior tell us about the \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade deal that Chinese negotiators agreed in Washington? We can safely predict that Beijing will backpedal or cheat.\n\nThey promised to liberalize financial services in this agreement, but they already promised that before: in 2011, the Chinese government vowed to \u201csupport open environments for investment in financial services and cross-border portfolio investment.\u201d They didn\u2019t.\n\nAs part of this deal, Beijing promised to make yet-to-be determined progress on intellectual property. But China previously promised Obama \u201cconstructive dialogue and cooperation on this issue,\u201d when the former president raised intellectual property theft.\n\nAs for the key immediate concession that Trump extracted from China, which was a promise to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural goods to $50 billion, Beijing isn\u2019t even waiting for negotiators to complete a written agreement to renege. \\Already, sources in Beijing are signaling that such purchases are contingent on the U.S. dropping all new tariffs on China. That wasn\u2019t part of the deal.\n\nThe stock market is nonetheless cheering the deal and Trump has remained optimistic, again trying hard to make diplomacy work. He has been tougher on China than any president but is not yet prepared to slam the door on Beijing and signal the full \u201cdecoupling\u201d of the U.S. and Chinese economies. But Chinese government duplicity and ill will may stymie his best efforts\u2014and the prospects of comprehensive trade deal. Don\u2019t expect the trade war to end.\n\nChristian Whiton was a State Department senior advisor in the Donald Trump and George W. Bush administrations.
