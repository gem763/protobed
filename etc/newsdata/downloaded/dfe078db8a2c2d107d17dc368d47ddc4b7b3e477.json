Are we there yet at the Sunday reflection?", "language": "en", "text": "This morning\u2019s Gospel reading is Luke 18:1\u20138:\n\nJesus told his disciples a parable about the necessity for them to pray always without becoming weary. He said, \u201cThere was a judge in a certain town who neither feared God nor respected any human being. And a widow in that town used to come to him and say, \u2018Render a just decision for me against my adversary.\u2019 For a long time the judge was unwilling, but eventually he thought, \u2018While it is true that I neither fear God nor respect any human being, because this widow keeps bothering me I shall deliver a just decision for her lest she finally come and strike me.\u2019\u201d The Lord said, \u201cPay attention to what the dishonest judge says. Will not God then secure the rights of his chosen ones who call out to him day and night? Will he be slow to answer them? I tell you, he will see to it that justice is done for them speedily. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?\u201d\n\nAt what point does persistence become a vice rather than a virtue? It depends on the context \u2014 and the object of that persistence, of course. We have all had experiences with persistence that tipped over into something else entirely.\n\nThe classic example, for both parents and former children on family trips, is the constant refrain of \u201care we there yet?\u201d Children have very little sense of distance, time, patience, or the limits of their parents\u2019 tolerance, for that matter. They keep asking because they\u2019re not driving and have no idea where they are at in relation to the start or finish of their journey. At some point, what parent hasn\u2019t wanted to strangle their child after the nth repetition of that question or some form of it in complaint?\n\nEven as adults, we worry that we fall from persistence into annoyance and perhaps worse by pressing our interests with others. We wonder whether our friends really want to hear from us as often as we like to engage them. How often should one ask for a date before \u201cgetting the hint\u201d? Do we keep applying for a job at the same company when new positions come up, or will that ruin future prospects by making us look impatient and passive-aggressively scolding?\n\nAll of these suffer from similar roots, which is the limits of our own experience and knowledge of these situations. We do not know whether the employer even considered us for the earlier jobs or remember us now. We can\u2019t know the internal assessments of others \u2014 only those signals we see, or think we see. We don\u2019t know the roadmap or even grasp the concept of the distances involved. We suffer from knowledge so incomplete that we cannot possibly see the whole truth, and therefore cannot calculate our potential for changing anything about it.\n\nThis specific parable only appears in Luke, and is similar to another parable told by Jesus in Luke 11, the parable of the importunate neighbor. In neither case does Luke explain the catalyst for telling this parable, but it seems apparent that the question of persistence in prayer must have come up, perhaps in a manner that it has been debated ever since. Since the Lord hears all prayer, and since the Lord\u2019s will prevails over ours, is it an insult to keep bothering the Lord with the same prayer over and over again? Is it not an attempt to demand that the Lord follow our will rather than His?\n\nIn both instances, Jesus uses the parables to insist that persistence in prayer is a virtue, as long as one is praying for justice and mercy. The earlier parable makes the same specific point, which is that mere persistence itself pays off. In Luke 11:8, one can almost hear the smile on Jesus\u2019 face when he teaches, \u201cI tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.\u201d\n\nThat leaves us with two key questions: what are we praying for, and why pray at all? Both parables show the value of the petitions, as long as they acknowledge God\u2019s will. The persistent widow pleads for justice and mercy, which the Lord Himself promises and which all legitimate authority should recognize. She pleads for a return of a right relationship between authority and those whom it governs, to which the Lord wishes for all of us to conform. The earlier parable, the one that gives us The Lord\u2019s Prayer, exalts the Lord and asks for only our portion each day of God\u2019s bounty along with His protection. It is a prayer of both justice and mercy.\n\nOn the second question, let\u2019s look at what happens in both parables when the petitions are made. In today\u2019s Gospel, the corrupt judge gets forced to conform to God\u2019s will through the persistence of the widow. If she had not persisted in her petitions, the judge would have continued in his corruption; instead, the judge has become an instrument of the Lord in ensuring justice and mercy. In the parable of the importunate neighbor, a similar if less dramatic change is also seen. The \u201cshameless audacity\u201d of the petitioner changes the heart of the neighbor and forces him into an act of selflessness, albeit begrudgingly.\n\nThe outcomes in either case are less important than the process, however. We are not promised outcomes from prayer, but are encouraged to pray nonetheless. The neighbor is not promised the food, nor is the widow promised justice and mercy from a corrupt judge.\n\nSo why pray at all? Prayer reminds us of our own misaligned perception of God and ourselves. It reminds us that we are all riding in the backseat on this journey, with no real sense of the endpoint or of the scale of the road. We are all children bleating at God, \u201cAre we there yet? When are we going to get there? Why aren\u2019t we going any faster?\u201d The more we recognize that we are not in control and that we don\u2019t know what the itinerary really is, the more likely we are to put our faith and trust in a loving God rather than rely on ourselves alone on the journey. That persistent prayer forms us to recognize others as brothers and sisters on the same journey and to have hearts more open to love and mercy for them.\n\nThat\u2019s the moment we will have truly arrived.\n\nThe front-page image is a detail from \u201cThe Unjust Judge and the Importunate Widow,\u201d a wood engraving by John Everett Millais in 1864.
