By focusing on its comparatively favorable results, they are neglecting the reasons behind them \u2014 and that these will turn decidedly unfavorable next year. In North Carolina, Democrats benefited in candidate and cash; in 2020, they will be disadvantaged badly in both.\n\nOn Sept. 10, in North Carolina\u2019s Ninth Congressional District, Republicans narrowly retained a district they have held almost 60 years. The contest pitted conservative Republican Dan Bishop against moderate Democrat Dan McCready. Mr. Bishop won by two points, but both parties could claim a victory: Republicans for winning and Democrats for keeping the margin well below Mr. Trump\u2019s double-digit 2016 total.\n\nWhile Democrats pounced on the outcome as moral victory, extrapolating from a single congressional loss to a national presidential victory is a great leap of faith.\n\nLooking locally first, Republicans actually increased their margin above 2018\u2019s disputed one, which forced this special election. Close is not victory and backward is not forward.\n\nEven looking collectively, off-year congressional elections \u2014 either midterms or special elections \u2014 are a far cry from presidential ones. Voter turnout is much heavier for presidential elections. According to the Census, 53 percent of Americans voted in the 2018 midterms \u2014 11 percent more than the previous midterm. However, 61.4 percent voted in 2016\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThis wide difference, in which the larger turnout elects a president and then a lower turnout turns on the president\u2019s party in Congress long has been a regular pattern in American politics. Bill Clinton lost 54 House seats in his 1994 midterm and Barack Obama lost 63 in 2010 \u2014 both well more than President Trump lost last year.\n\nFurther, the ebb of the midterm often has little impact on the flow of the incumbent\u2019s campaign two years later, when the larger electorate, which elected the president, returns to the polls. As evidence, both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama handily won re-election; overall, elected incumbents seeking re-election have gone 11-3 over the last century.\n\nThis flow for Mr. Trump, particularly in contrast to North Carolina\u2019s ninth district in 2019, is likely to be especially large. By now everyone recognizes Mr. Trump is sui generis: Love him or hate him, there is no imitating him. Mr. Bishop tried and won, but he is no replacement for Mr. Trump himself.\n\nIn contrast, Democrats nationally will likely fare worse with their 2020 candidate than they did with their one in North Carolina\u2019s ninth district in 2019. As the AP wrote on the local race: \u201cMcCready\u2019s moderate profile resembled that of many Democrats who won in Republican-leaning districts in the 2018 midterms.\u201d In 2020, Democrats will again need to win Trump areas; however, they will almost certainly have to do it without a moderate candidate.\n\nAccording to last week\u2019s Real Clear Politics\u2019s average of national polling, Democrats\u2019 collective left (everyone but Joe Biden, John DeLaney and Steve Bullock) stands at 60.3 percent support versus B-D-B\u2019s at just 27.5 percent.\n\nFacing a more than 2-1 deficit, it is hard to see a moderate winning the Democratic nomination. That means Democrats will run nationally to the left \u2014 and likely behind \u2014 where they were in North Carolina\u2019s ninth district and the 2018 midterms.\n\nAnother notable difference will be in cash. According to an Issue One estimate, the day before North Carolina\u2019s ninth district vote, all-in spending by and for the two major candidates was just over $9 million apiece, with the Democrats slightly ahead.\n\nIn 2016, Democrats had an enormous cash advantage. According to Open Secrets, Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidate plus outside money amounted to $770 million; Mr. Trump\u2019s total was $448 million.\n\nDemocrats lost both races despite cash advantages. What happens in 2020 when they face a likely sizable disadvantage? According to Open Secrets, Mr. Trump has more candidate campaign money than the top three Democrats combined. If outside money is included, Mr. Trump surpasses the top eight Democrats combined.\n\nAdditionally, the Democrats are already spending their money \u2014 on each other. Having already vigorously shaken their money trees, there may not be large amounts left for when their single nominee faces Mr. Trump. On the other side, Mr. Trump is saving \u2014 and continuing to bank \u2014 his for whenever, and whomever, Democrats finally choose.\n\nCoupled with Mr. Trump\u2019s unparalleled ability to generate \u201cearned media\u201d \u2014 both innate and as an incumbent \u2014 he could not only virtually dictate the message content, but dominate 2020\u2019s message war.\n\nDemocrats are narrowly looking at the recent results of North Carolina\u2019s Ninth Congressional District. At the same time, they are overlooking the more important reasons behind them. The results may dominate Democratic talking points, but the underlying reasons will determine Democrats\u2019 2020 fate. While favorable factors shaped results in in North Carolina\u2019s ninth district and 2018\u2019s midterms, unfavorable ones \u2014 particularly candidate and cash \u2014 will shape 2020\u2019s against them.\n\n\u2022 J.T.
