REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nIn what was to be their second attempt at listing in just over a year, KKR, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Varde Partners pulled the expected A$1 billion ($676.20 million) offering late on Tuesday, according to sources, even after finding buyers for all its shares.\n\nIn an email to Latitude staff on Wednesday, reviewed by Reuters, Latitude Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Fahour confirmed the Initial Public Offering was canceled but said the company would continue as a private enterprise.\n\n\u201cFeedback from investors has been overwhelmingly positive and although demand has been strong, some investors have not been prepared to offer a price per share that reflects a fair value given the strength and performance of our business,\u201d Fahour wrote in the email.\n\n\u201cFor this reason our shareholders have decided not to proceed with the listing process at this time, a decision that\u2019s in the interests of our business, our people, our customers and partners,\u201d Fahour added.\n\nA Latitude spokesman told Reuters the email was authentic.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s disappointing not to list at this time, Latitude is stronger than ever, which means better outcomes for our people, customers and partners,\u201d Fahour wrote, without offering information about any future listing.\n\nLatitude had filed a prospectus with the regulator last month valuing the company at between A$2 and A$2.25 per share but over the weekend decided to discount the offer price by as much as 20.9% due to low demand, Reuters reported.\n\nThe company, which offers easy-access loans and credit cards with minimal paperwork, and its bookrunners were due to finalize the raising on Wednesday and shares in the new company were due to begin trading Oct. 18.\n\nKKR, Deutsche Bank and Varde Partners founded Latitude in 2015 when they bought GE Capital\u2019s Australian and New Zealand consumer lending arm for A$8.2 billion.\n\nLast year, Latitude deferred a planned IPO that would have valued the business at about A$5 billion due to market conditions and a management change, while the country\u2019s financial industry was also being scrutinized by a national misconduct inquiry.", "description": "Private equity giant KKR & Co and its partners canceled what was to be Australia's biggest listing of the year, lender Latitude Financial, because investors would not pay a price that reflected its value, the Latitude CEO said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Paulina Duran", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441068314&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0RL", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
