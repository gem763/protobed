So long as the GOP is united, and so long as Republican lawmakers are willing to stand behind him, Trump believes his position is strong.\n\nAnd for the last 1,000 days, the president has had reason to be pleased with his party\u2019s fealty. There have been some exceptions, but they\u2019ve largely been limited to a modest number of senators.\n\nYesterday, however, was something altogether new.\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to condemn President Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal of American forces from northern Syria. Despite stark divisions over Democrats\u2019 Trump impeachment inquiry, Democrats and Republicans banded together and approved a nonbinding resolution by 354-60 vote. The resolution states Congress\u2019 opposition to the troop pullback and says Turkey should cease its military action in Syria. And the measure says the White House should present a plan for an \u201cenduring defeat\u201d of the Islamic State group.\n\nIn all, 192 House Republicans voted on the resolution, and 129 of them sided with Democrats against the White House\u2019s position. The president has convinced himself that his policy in Syria was \u201cstrategically brilliant,\u201d but it appears even GOP lawmakers know better.\n\nTrump has seen votes go against him on Capitol Hill, but he\u2019s never seen such a lopsided defeat in the House.\n\nThere were no hysterical presidential tweets on the vote \u2013 at least not yet \u2013 but there\u2019s reason to believe yesterday\u2019s outcome on the House floor contributed to Trump\u2019s meltdown during a meeting with congressional leaders.\n\n\u201cI think that vote, the size of the vote \u2013 more than 2 to 1 of the Republicans voted to oppose what the president did \u2013 it probably got to the president, because he was shaken up by it,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s why we couldn\u2019t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing that yesterday\u2019s House vote was on a non-binding resolution: it was a largely symbolic measure, expressing an opinion of the House majority.\n\nBut in this case, that bipartisan opinion was that Trump has made a horrible foreign policy mistake.", "description": "Trump has seen votes go against him on Capitol Hill, but he's never seen such a lopsided defeat in the House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/trump_hill_shutdown_0.jpg?itok=0EGS3IYP", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
