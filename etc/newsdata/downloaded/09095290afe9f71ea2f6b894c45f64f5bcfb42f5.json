We're not, we're not being affected,\" he said.\n\nHis relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping is strong, Trump added, but \"we have, right now, a little spat.\"\n\nTrump also said he didn't want a \"partial deal\" with Beijing, moving away from his suggestion last week that he would consider an \"interim deal.\"\n\n\"We're looking for a complete deal. I'm not looking for a partial deal,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president's support for the all-or-nothing stance on the potential deal with China came amid recent signs of a thaw in tensions between the two countries.", "description": "President Trump also said he is \"not looking for a partial deal\" with Beijing, moving away from his suggestion last week that he would consider an \"interim deal.\"", "authors": ["Kevin Breuninger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106141243-1568996128441gettyimages-1175944250.jpeg?v=1568996175", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
