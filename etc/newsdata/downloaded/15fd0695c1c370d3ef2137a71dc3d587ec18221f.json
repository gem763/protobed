However, the option is not available at many healthcare facilities, including at hospitals that are part of Centura Health, a Catholic and Adventist faith-based network which views the procedure as against their religious values.\n\nThis August, Dr. Barbara Morris, a primary care and geriatrics doctor, tried to change that on behalf of one of her patients, Cornelius \u201cNeil\u201d Mahoney, a 64-year-old with stage four cancer who is being treated by Centura-affiliated doctors and caregivers.\n\nMahoney and Morris filed a suit against Centura, arguing that the hospital does not meet the state\u2019s requirements for an exemption to the law, and that the court should thusly declare that Centura cannot prohibit or penalize Morris for providing the treatment.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Because it seemed so obvious that they can\u2019t do it.\u201d (Centura also confirmed Morris\u2019 firing to Kaiser.)\n\nIn a statement provided to TIME by Centura Health\u2019s director of media relations and public relations, Wendy Forbes, the hospital network wrote:\n\nThere are no adequate words to express how sorry we are and the sadness we feel for Mr. Mahoney with his terminal diagnosis. We wish that he and his family were not facing this frustrating challenge. As a Christian ministry, Centura Health is firmly committed to providing health services consistent with our mission and core values. When the Colorado End-of-Life Options Act was passed, health care providers were not required by the act to assist qualified patients. Most hospitals and physicians opted out of the act largely based on the \u201cfirst, do no harm\u201d part of the Hippocratic Oath. Centura Health opted-out of the act grounded in our commitment to Christian ministry and to unequivocally promote and defend human dignity and the sacredness of every human life, in addition to the violation to the Hippocratic Oath. We believe the freedom of religion doctrine at the heart of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution supports our policies as a Christian healthcare ministry. We will vigorously defend our Constitutional rights, and our position will be made very clear early in litigation of this matter.\n\nTucker, the executive director of the advocacy group End of Life Liberty Project, tells TIME that the aid-in-dying act only prohibits health care facilities from providing the medication if the patient intends to take the medication on the facility\u2019s premises \u2014 not if they intend to take the medication at home.\n\nShe argues that cases like this could have major implications for the way end of life care is handled. \u201cAre we going to respect of the rights of patients and their choices for medical care, or are we going to let corporate medicine, or corporate medicine\u2019s religious doctrine, have the prerogative?\u201d Tucker says.\n\nCentura Health has argued in court that Morris had violated her employment agreement because she \u201cencouraged an option that she knew was morally unacceptable to her employer.\u201d It also argued that the case raises First Amendment issues, and should be heard in federal court, noting that euthanasia violates Catholic religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of religious doctrine, those Directives declare that suicide and euthanasia are never morally acceptable options and prohibit participation or cooperation in any intentional hastening of a person\u2019s natural death, including through an \u2018attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil,\u2019\u201d the document said.\n\nThe case is particularly timely as President Trump\u2019s administration has moved to broaden the criteria for religious exemptions for companies. For instance, the administration has worked to make it easier for companies to avoid providing birth control and to make decisions on hiring and firing employees on religious grounds.\n\nFor Mahoney, there might not be much time for the courts to decide. His health has declined dramatically throughout the year, according to court documents. He has now been diagnosed with stage four adenocarcinoma, and learned in July that there is no cure for his illness. A physician\u2019s estimate is that he will live four months without treatment and as much as 14 months with treatment.\n\nThe complaint says that Mahoney had multiple reasons for choosing a life-ending medication, including his experience with seeing close family members die, his concerns about his family witnessing his suffering, and a hope to avoid prolonged suffering. Since becoming ill, he\u2019s endured abdominal pain and distention; had difficulty eating, swallowing and breathing; lost 30 pounds; and had a \u201cmiserable\u201d experience during two of his rounds of chemotherapy, among other symptoms.\n\nAccording to Mahoney and Morris\u2019s complaint, Mahoney could be transferred to another facility for the end of life, but he would prefer not to because he\u2019d like to work with the healthcare providers he knows, and believes he would have to endure invasive testing he\u2019s already had to undergo over again, such as biopsies and CT scans.\n\nWrite to Tara Law at tara.law@time.com.", "description": "A Colorado physician who sued her healthcare network to provide aid-in-dying medication has been fired, despite a state law passed in 2017", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/colorado-doctor-fired-euthanasia.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
