Since the company\u2019s collapse -- what\u2019s been described as climate change\u2019s largest financial casualty to date -- wildfire victims, state politicians, activist investors and ratepayer advocates have clashed over the company\u2019s future.\n\nPG&E Chief Financial Officer Jason Wells described the company\u2019s plan on Monday as a \u201ccrucial step in a multistep process\u201d and said it may eventually be revised, depending on what the courts find the company legally responsible for paying.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a framework,\u201d Wells said.\n\nMike Danko, a lawyer representing wildfire victims, called the plan \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d\n\nWildfire Estimates\n\nComplicating PG&E\u2019s proposal is the fact that claims tied to the blazes are getting tallied in a separate court process that\u2019s only begun. While the company has given estimates, it may be months before a clear picture of the liabilities emerges.\n\nAny exit plan hinges on that estimate. The official tally could lead to an entire rewrite of PG&E\u2019s reorganization. A total that\u2019s higher than PG&E is capable of paying threatens to wipe out current shareholders since, under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, fire victims would be paid in full first.\n\nThat puts PG&E in a tenuous position as key creditor groups clamor to pitch their own restructuring proposals to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali. In August, Montali said he doesn\u2019t expect PG&E\u2019s plan to be the final since some details aren\u2019t yet available. But he said the company must present something credible or else he may open the door to rival ones.\n\nMeanwhile, time is running out for PG&E. The company has until June to get out of bankruptcy if it wants to participate in a fund recently established by California to help utilities cover the cost of future fires. The alternative is facing the prospect of another catastrophic blaze that could force it into financial ruin once again.\n\nHitting Snags\n\nPG&E\u2019s plan has already hit some snags: A group led by Pimco and Elliott has been floating one plan that would all but wipe out the stakes of current shareholders and hand control of the company over to them. They\u2019ve fought to have their proposal considered by Montali. PG&E shareholders would keep their current holdings under the company\u2019s plan, but their stakes may be significantly diluted by new shares issued.\n\nOn Sept. 6, a measure that would\u2019ve allowed the company to use tax-free state bonds to pay off its fire claims stalled in California\u2019s legislature. And San Francisco is offering to buy some of the utility\u2019s local electrical assets for $2.5 billion. The city -- PG&E\u2019s hometown -- sees the deal as an opportunity to save ratepayers money and fulfill its long-held desire to break away from the company.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\n\u201cWe find the plan disappointing, as it falls apart if wildfire claims are estimated to be over $18 billion.\u201d\n\n-- Philip Brendel, senior credit analystClick here to view the report.\n\nPG&E filed its plan without an outline that describes in plain terms how creditors will be treated. That outline, known as a disclosure statement, typically helps creditors decide how to vote on the reorganization. Montali permitted PG&E to put off filing it.\n\nThe case is PG&E Corp., 19-bk-30088, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Northern District of California (San Francisco)\n\n(Updates with comment from tort committee in third paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mark Chediak in San Francisco at mchediak@bloomberg.net;Steven Church in Wilmington, Delaware at schurch3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Joe Ryan\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- California utility giant PG&E Corp. has issued its long-awaited plan for emerging from the largest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history: Raise debt, offer equity and cap wildfire liabilities that led to its collapse at $18 billion -- less than half of what victims and insurers want.The plan", "authors": ["Mark Chediak", "Steven Church"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yPlUFEnGjrCmCTg2p5laww--~B/aD05MTI7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/8fd4c4e45a210bd4b7f858f2ae85d1b5", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
