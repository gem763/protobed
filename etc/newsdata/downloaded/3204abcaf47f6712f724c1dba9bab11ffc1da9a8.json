I like the format personally as a manager now.\n\n\"If you ask me can we play more European games, I personally don't know where you'd fit them in amongst our busy schedule.\n\n\"I always find it hard with the players to keep the quality level and the freshness within the (team) so I think if we did do that there would be a lot of discussion about how that worked practically.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe League Cup which would be the obvious casualty if teams need to fit in more games - but Lampard is a fan of the competition.\n\n\"We won it a couple of times at Chelsea and it was the first competition I ever did win,\" he said.\n\nAn initial proposal, drawn up by UEFA in conjunction with the ECA earlier this year, has been sidelined by strong opposition.\n\nIt had envisaged a three-tier pan European league with promotion and relegation between the divisions.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe top tier would have been the new version of the Champions League, but 24 of the 32 teams involved would have their places for the following season - breaking the tradition that qualification is achieved through domestic competition.\n\nEuropean Leagues chairman Lars-Christer Olsson said football, not finance, had to be the main consideration in redesigning UEFA competition.\n\n\"The starting point has to be football and not the distribution of revenues,\" said the Swede, a former UEFA chief executive. \"We have to remember that we are a sport first and foremost.\"\n\nMarc Ingla, chief executive of French club Lille, told news agency Reuters that clubs wanted more European games.\n\n\"All clubs want more Europe and better Europe but not at the cost of losing access rights to these competitions, not at the cost of having a marginal portion of the revenue that can be generated or at the cost of giving even more means to the top clubs,\" he said.", "description": "Controversial plans to redesign European competition have met with opposition from leagues and clubs", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566467.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Chelsea-FC-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
