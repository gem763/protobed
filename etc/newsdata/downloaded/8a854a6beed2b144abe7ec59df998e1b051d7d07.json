We don\u2019t have a lot of ethnic minorities living in north Devon.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t exposed to people from other countries. They don\u2019t travel a lot. I think there is a slight disconnect with North Devon being isolated, being rural, and low income. Perhaps they don\u2019t appreciate the advantages of being in the European Union?\u201d\n\nAnti-Brexit Lib Dems Cheer EU's Verhofstadt as He Hails 'World Order' of 'Empires' https://t.co/wh5u3actyq \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 15, 2019\n\nJust three days before, the Liberal Democrat candidate for Banff and Buchan stepped down after saying Tory Brexiteer MPs should be \u201chung, drawn, and quartered\u201d.\n\n\u201cJohnson, Fox, Gove, Davis, Rees-Mogg should be hung, drawn, and quartered, with each quarter being sent to the four corners of the UK to be burned at the stake,\u201d Galen Milne had written on social media.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg responded in typical good humour, saying: \u201cTypical Lib Dem. Mr Milne should get his facts straight. As Lord President of the Council, I am entitled to the privilege of being beheaded.\u201d\n\nIt is not just the candidates who are known for their colourful language. During May\u2019s European Parliament elections, then-party leader Vince Cable launched campaign material bearing the slogan: \u201cBollocks to Brexit.\u201d\n\nThe motto was passed down to his successor Jo Swinson, who said during her leadership acceptance speech in July: \u201cWhen I say Bollocks to Brexit I mean it.\u201d\n\nParty members approved at September\u2019s conference to back revoking Article 50 \u2014 cancelling Brexit altogether \u2014 without a referendum. However, that would only occur if the party won an absolute majority \u2014 seen as highly unlikely, given the Liberal Democrats are riding comfortably in third place in the polls.", "description": "A Liberal Democrat candidate has compared Brexit to Nazi Germany in the latest embarrassment for the pro-EU party.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Liberal-Democrats-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
