With Jason in the team, I think we\u2019re a better team for sure.\n\n\u201cWith him coming in at four with hopefully the new ball worn off, and hopefully myself and (opener) Rory (Burns) doing our jobs at the top, it enables him to come in and play his way. He\u2019s a dangerous player so he\u2019s great to have there.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s Steve Smith, who scored 378 runs in three innings, is set to return to the side after missing the third test due to concussion.\n\nSmith was hit on the neck by a rising Jofra Archer delivery during the second test at Lord\u2019s and England fast bowler Stuart Broad expects the former skipper to be well-prepared.\n\n\u201cWhenever a batsman seems in great rhythm, a period of time out of being in the middle could affect them but he\u2019s a world-class batsman,\u201d Broad said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be very ready for the conditions he will face here at Old Trafford.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of to and fro between him and Jofra. And Jofra will be excited to continue that battle. Smith will be very hungry to come back into a crucial test match.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s one-wicket win at Headingley prevented Australia from retaining the Ashes, and Broad said this was the most closely-contested series he had been a part of.\n\n\u201cThe momentum of that test match shifted to England and with that the series,\u201d Broad said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever played in an Ashes that has been as closely matched man-to-man.\n\n\u201cThe teams are so close and you can see that by the punches being thrown by each side and how they\u2019re soaking it up. It\u2019s a fascinating series to be involved in.\u201d\n\nThe fourth test in Manchester starts on Wednesday with the series level at 1-1. The final match at The Oval in London begins on Sept. 12.", "description": "Joe Denly will swap places with struggling opener Jason Roy in the England batting order for the fourth Ashes test against Australia at Old Trafford, he said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425430326&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF81180"}
