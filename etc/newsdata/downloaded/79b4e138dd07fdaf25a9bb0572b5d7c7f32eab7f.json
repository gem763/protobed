No alcohol or drugs were found in his body that could have affected his judgement, neither other underlying illnesses that could have contributed.\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, former Peterborough junior player Dion Raitt, who has described being abused both by Carson and a second junior coach, Bob Higgins, now serving a prison sentence for sexual attacks that took place over 25 years, said he had mixed emotions at the conclusion.\n\nRaitt said: \u201cCarson took the coward\u2019s way out. He\u2019s not going to remain thought of as a great coach any more. Everyone can see through it now. He\u2019s committed suicide on the day of court to avoid prison. That is cowardly. Survivors haven\u2019t had their day in court but this just may help them get some closure.\u201d\n\nRaitt, an ambassador for the organisation the Offside Trust, which works with survivors of abuse in sport, said he hoped the coroner\u2019s conclusion might prompt others to come forward.\n\nSteve Walters, another football abuse survivor and a spokesperson for the Offside Trust, expressed relief and said the conclusion would \u201cprovide some justice to survivors of Carson\u201d.\n\nDuring a successful career, Carson worked as a junior developer for clubs including Norwich City and Peterborough United and also scouted for Chelsea.\n\nAfter the Guardian broke the football abuse scandal, dozens of former players contacted the police about Carson. He was arrested and due to be tried by a jury on charges involving 11 boys, which he denied.\n\nIn a statement to the inquest, Carson\u2019s widow, Pauline, said they had got on with family life while he was on bail and he had been looking forward to defending himself in court.\n\nBut she added he had got mixed up over the date of the trial and thought he had to be in court on Wednesday 9 January.\n\nShe said that at 9am on the morning of Monday 7 January, Carson contacted his barrister to ask him about the arrangements for that week only to be told that he needed to be in court at 10am that day. His barrister told him to take his time but to get to court when he could.\n\nCarson quickly changed into a pinstriped suit, a tie and said goodbye to his wife, the court heard. \u201cHe was stressed and confused,\u201d she said.\n\nThe most direct route to the court from Carson\u2019s home in Cambridge was west via the A14 and north up the A1 \u2013 a 40-mile journey.\n\nKit Carson, a football star-maker with a dark history of alleged abuse Read more\n\nBut Carson appears to have driven east and shortly after 9.30am his Mazda left the A1303 near the village of Bottisham and smashed into a tree. Passersby, paramedics and an air ambulance crew tried to save his life but he died from brain injuries.\n\nA forensic collision investigator, PC Sean Redman, said the weather was calm and clear and the road surface not slippery.\n\nThe Mazda\u2019s tyre tracks suggested the vehicle had left the road without skidding or braking and the car had travelled in a straight line into the tree. There was no evidence that any other vehicle was involved and the car had no mechanical faults. Carson was not using his phone at the time. He was wearing his seat belt.\n\nThe officer agreed with the coroner that the route had not been the \u201clogical\u201d one to take if he had been heading to court and Carson appeared to have been heading away from Peterborough rather than towards it. There were no traffic delays on the A14 or A1 that might have prompted Carson to try to find an alternative route.\n\nThe coroner said there was no evidence of Carson taking \u201cavoiding action\u201d before hitting the tree. He said: \u201cIn my view the obvious inference is that he intended to take his own life. My conclusion is that sadly Mr Carson committed suicide.\u201d\n\nMembers of Carson\u2019s family, including his wife, attended the hearing but did not comment.\n\nCarson had denied counts of indecent assault and one of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity between 1978 and 2009.", "description": "Michael \u2018Kit\u2019 Carson crashed into tree on first day of trial for sexual abuse charges involving 11 boys", "authors": ["Steven Morris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/847049624e79b89892ded4f9221c4e52306e27ec/0_117_3251_1950/master/3251.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=27c426a00064556a8cd9196b12702de8", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
