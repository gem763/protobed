She did not comment when asked at what time Byford had withdrawn the letter. The MTA had declined to affirm the existence of the letter earlier in the day.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nByford had no immediate comment.\n\nByford resigned last week, after growing concerned about the prospect of having to oversee potential service cuts and layoffs, at the same time Gov. Andrew Cuomo was putting additional pressures on the MTA\u2019s operating budget.\n\nHe also tired of having to spend time helping set up various tech-related conferences for the governor, which were a distraction from his day job running New York City\u2019s subway and bus system.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere and I remain laser focused on improving day-to-day service for millions of New Yorkers and delivering a transformed transit network,\u201d Byford said in a statement released by the MTA press shop on Friday. \u201cThe historic $51 billion capital plan provides a golden opportunity to further transform the subway and bus network \u2014 with unprecedented investments in accessibility \u2014 and my team and I are totally focused on achieving that. The Governor and I are on exactly the same page about the need to dramatically improve the transit system in New York and we now have the plan and the funding to do that.\"", "description": "Byford resigned last week, after growing concerned about the prospect of having to oversee potential service cuts and layoffs.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/99/94/f6399b4d4f109c855b3b6303a525/untitled.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
