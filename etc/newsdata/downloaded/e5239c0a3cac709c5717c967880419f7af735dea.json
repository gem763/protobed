Despite that, he was selected over the more experienced Camille Lopez to combine in the halves with Antoine Dupont.\n\nBrunel made another crucial pick at the back of the scrum in preferring Alldritt - who has three tries in seven test appearances - to veteran Louis Picamoles, who is appearing in his third World Cup.\n\nMaxime M\u00e9dard starts at fullback ahead of Thomas Ramos, who was selected among the reserves with Lopez and Picamoles. With Wesley Fofana injured, former rugby sevens winger Virimi Vakatawa will start at center alongside Ga\u00ebl Fickou.\n\nRabah Slimani and Jefferson Poirot will start in the front row, as expected, on either side of hooker and captain Guilhem Guirado.\n\nBoth teams have points to prove, in a tough Pool C which also contains 2003 champion England, Tonga and the United States.\n\nCoached by former standout hooker Mario Ledesma, two-time semifinalist Argentina has to stop a losing streak reaching 10 straight games since winning in Australia in last year\u2019s Rugby Championship. The Pumas came close to beating New Zealand for the first time and narrowly lost to Australia in the same tournament this season.\n\nThree-time runner-up France has been on a downward slope after years of mediocrity, punctuated by a home loss to Fiji, a walloping 44-8 defeat away to England and one top-three finish in the Six Nations since losing the World Cup final in 2011.\n\nHuget, who is aiming to his tally of 13 international tries, thinks the heavy criticism has been justified.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal given our results, we get what we deserve. Now, I think the squad is ready to honor the jersey, fight for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to show that a World Cup is different from the Six Nations or any tours, and that this team has talent.\u201d\n\nA lot hangs on France beating Argentina, especially with a confident England looming large.\n\n\u201cBut if you look back to 2011, with two losses France still got to the final,\u201d Huget said. \u201cAnything can happen in this competition, that\u2019s what is beautiful about it.\u201d\n\nFrance lost the 2007 third-place match to Argentina but won their previous encounter, 28-13 in November, and won 27-0 away in 2016.\n\nFickou pointed to weaknesses and strengths in Argentina\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cThey have quick players who always have a lot of movement. Not always in the right way, but with a lot of commitment,\u201d Fickou said. \u201cThey keep the ball very well and for a very long time in midfield. They\u2019re very strong in this sector. We know we don\u2019t have any room for error; we must be present and very aggressive in the rucks.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s attacking rucks are an ongoing weakness, and Fickou says \u201cit\u2019s down to us to impose our style of play and our aggression.\u201d\n\nThat also means closing down Argentina\u2019s flyhalf Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez - Fickou\u2019s club teammate at Stade Fran\u00e7ais.\n\n\u201cIf we let him play, it will be very difficult to defend. He has a very good kicking game, he\u2019s very technical,\u201d Fickou said. \u201cI think that if we put him under enormous pressure, that we\u2019re aggressive and if we manage to control him, we\u2019ll have controlled 50 percent of their team.\u201d\n\nKicking may prove decisive if the weather turns bad, with heavy downpours soaking Tokyo in recent days.\n\n\u201cThere may be fog, rain too,\u201d Fickou said. \u201cControlling the ball is not easy when it rains, but we are prepared for all conditions.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFrance: Maxime M\u00e9dard, Damian Penaud, Ga\u00ebl Fickou, Virimi Vakatawa, Yoann Huget, Romain Ntamack, Antoine Dupont; Gr\u00e9gory Alldritt, Charles Ollivon, Wenceslas Lauret, Sebastien Vahaamahina, Arthur Iturria, Rabah Slimani, Guilhem Guirado (captain), Jefferson Poirot.
