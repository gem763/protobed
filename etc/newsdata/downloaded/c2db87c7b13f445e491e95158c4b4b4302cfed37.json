It didn\u2019t taste like insect,\u201d said one satisfied customer at Insect Experience, Angelo Caralse. \u201cIt tasted like croquettes, it tasted like potatoes and chickpea with a slightly nutty, spicy flavor. I enjoyed it.\u201d", "description": "South African chef Mario Barnard said he was \"grossed out\" and did not entirely enjoy eating grilled scorpions and crunchy insects mixed with garlic and spices on a trip to Thailand four years ago.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425679530&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF820KQ"}
