There are also specific concerns over whether any technological solution could be delivered to monitor cross-border trade.\n\nCritics said the paper, seen by the Guardian, should \u201cring alarm bells\u201d across government over how likely it is that alternative arrangements to the backstop will be found.\n\nThe dossier marked \u201cofficial-sensitive\u201d prepared for the EU Exit Negotiations Board is dated 28 August. It details how the findings of all advisory groups informing the government on the Northern Irish border are being kept deliberately under wraps to try to avoid hampering Britain\u2019s intended renegotiation of the backstop agreed to by Theresa May.\n\nAlternative systems to avoid a hard Northern Irish border after Brexit have become the central tenet of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy. He sees this as a way of unlocking a new deal with Europe and has claimed that there are \u201cabundant solutions\u201d.\n\nHowever, the damning report shows there is no single deliverable solution at present, despite the fact Johnson is almost a third of the way through the \u201c30 days\u201d target that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave him to come up with a fresh border proposal.\n\nThe report said: \u201cIt is evident that every facilitation has concerns and issues related to them. The complexity of combining them into something more systemic and as part of one package is a key missing factor at present.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s claim that a hard border could be avoided with mobile checks of livestock and crops was dismissed by experts as the most unlikely option to work. The report said: \u201cOverall there were a number of concerns surrounding the deliverability of technological facilitations.\u201d\n\nQuestions were also raised over whether a trusted trader scheme \u2013 the current favourite for a border solution \u2013 would require infrastructure to set it up.\n\nMP Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: \u201cAs we continue to get closer to 31 October, with Boris Johnson attempting to shut down our democracy, this leaked document rings alarm bells. It proves the government has no deliverable solution to the Irish border, let alone being able to find one within the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cThe fact that in this document there is not a single option that can be put forward to the EU as a viable alternative to the backstop, and that No 10 do not want to release these findings as they know Boris Johnson\u2019s bluff will be revealed, simply shows why MPs must come together to stop no deal.\u201d\n\nNaomi Smith, the chief executive of the Best for Britain group, which is \u201ccommitted to finding a democratic way to stop Brexit\u201d, said: \u201cIt is utterly shameful that the government has found no practical solution to the question of the Irish border, despite its insistence that the backstop be removed.\n\n\u201cRemoving the backstop without something to take its place would fundamentally undermine the Good Friday agreement, and the fragile peace process started just 20 years ago which it guards.\n\n\u201cDespite the prime minister shutting down parliament, MPs must do all they can to block a damaging and undemocratic no-deal Brexit, and the reimposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nThe official report summarises the work of two groups tasked with coming up with border ideas: advisory groups involving agricultural and food experts, customs and legal specialists and senior Northern Irish figures; and a Whitehall-based group which is due to shortly come up with a negotiating position on how to rework the withdrawal agreement to present to the EU.\n\nBorder solutions the report deems as having the most potential are listed as:\n\nRegulatory and industry assurance schemes.\n\nTrusted trader schemes.\n\nSmarter risking (a technological solution that involves data sharing).\n\nA Northern Ireland sanitary and phytosanitary zone to track contamination and disease.\n\nThere were significant concerns about an artificial intelligence option, which experts felt might not detect disease and chemical contamination of food.\n\nOnboard vehicle technology which could track the location, weight and temperature of goods was also considered risky if a lorry might suddenly be taken out of service and goods offloaded into a non-registered vehicle.\n\nPhysical goods checks through mobile units could take weeks and involve lengthy periods of quarantine, the report found. The units could also be vulnerable to \u201ctargeting\u201d and staff could be at risk, it said.\n\nThe sheer scale of the crisis facing Britain\u2019s decrepit constitution has been laid bare | Will Hutton Read more\n\nSignificantly, smaller businesses in Northern Ireland could suffer through the additional administration required to send and receive goods across the border, as well as other constraints and costs, the report found. They might also struggle with data collection or be unwilling to share information due to concerns around privacy.\n\n\u201cThis is because they do not have the existing systems in place and are more likely to have non-standardised products and product ranges,\u201d it said.\n\nOn keeping the work around border solutions secret as the government prepares to go back to the EU to discuss the withdrawal agreement, the report said: \u201cDExEU [the Department for Exiting the European Union] has been considering whether a paper consolidating the findings from all of the advisory groups should be published in late September/early October.\n\n\u201cHowever, we and other departments have cautioned against this given the potential negative impacts on the renegotiation with the EU and we understand No 10 are in agreement \u2026\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the DExEU said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on leaked documents.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, the Republic of Ireland\u2019s minister for foreign affairs, Simon Coveney, said his country would not agree to drop the backstop merely for the \u201cpolitical convenience\u201d of the British prime minister.\n\nIn a forthright interview with the Sunday Business Post newspaper, he said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single EU member state putting pressure on Ireland to move away from that position, despite the fact that the UK has spoken to all of them and used all of the persuasion that they can muster to actually move countries away from that position.\u201d\n\nHe said dropping the backstop would only create problems for Ireland further down the line. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend to people that we can do that for political convenience now to get a deal, and then find that Irish politics is dominated by the border issue indefinitely into the future. We\u2019re not doing that,\u201d he said.", "description": "Exclusive: leaked report says at present there is no deliverable alternative to the backstop", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c5813c1a4b02cf988a334d073d74e9c3be23a4/0_0_5619_3370/master/5619.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d13cde96de068a23943ea69cafad4eb3"}
