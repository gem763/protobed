Yep.\n\n\"For the actual proposal I wanted it to be really special,\" said Dhar. \"I decided to do it in Paris because it's one of her favourite places in the world.\n\n(Image: laurag_143/Instagram)\n\n\"I decided to rent a private terrace that overlooks the Eiffel Tower. My plan was to blindfold her and then walk out to this amazing view.\n\n\"Right as the blindfold would come off, I'd have violinists playing her favourite song.\n\n\"I'd walk her down a path that would be covered in long stem white candles on both sides and with the Eiffel Tower as the backdrop, I'd get down on one knee and propose.\"\n\nDespite the rain (maybe the private terrace should have had a roof made from caviar), Laura happily agreed to become Dhar's 'forever'.\n\nAfter uploading photos every step of the way, the couple's millions of followers couldn't get over the sheer size of the ring.\n\nOne wrote: \"Holy shhh! You're finger is gunna fall off!\"\n\nAnother said: \"How can you even hold your hand up, that thing looks heavy AF!\"\n\nWelcome to proposals in 2019. Good luck.", "description": "The week-long adventure started in LA and ended in Paris, but it was the size of the ring that stole the show", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543933.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Dhar-Mann.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
