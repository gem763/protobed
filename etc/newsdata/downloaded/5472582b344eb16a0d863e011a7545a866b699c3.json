Those didn\u2019t include any of the countries the hijackers came from, or any of the countries where his own businesses have been the most active. It did include American green-card holders, and dual citizens of allies like Britain.\n\nAs planes landed Saturday morning, people already vetted by the United States\u2014with families and lives here\u2014found themselves caught in a nightmare, a world that had changed while they were in the air.\n\nA Clemson professor visiting her family in Tehran posted that she was trapped there, scrambling to find someone here to watch her dog. A Syrian family of six with visas was placed on a plane back to Doha. A translator who\u2019d worked with our military in Iraq was put in cuffs, before two New York Congressmen intervened on his behalf. Others were questioned about their opinion of President Trump and pressed to show their social media accounts to federal officials.\n\nIncredibly, the government won\u2019t (or perhaps can\u2019t) say how many people have been detained, though an unnamed senior official at the Department of Homeland Security official told the Washington Post Saturday that 109 people had been denied entry upon arrival and 173 had not been allowed to board flights at foreign airports. That\u2019s the same DHS that didn\u2019t see the order until hours before Trump signed it, according to CNN , and was unable to offer a legal analysis until after it was in effect.\n\nSaturday evening, Federal District Court Judge Ann Donnelly asked the government to explain itself. It could not. In a remarkable display, U.S. attorneys\u2014rarely at a loss for an argument\u2014were as flummoxed as many of the rest of us.\n\nThey briefly tried to argue that since the two named parties in the ACLU\u2019s request for a temporary stay on parts of Trump\u2019s order had already been released, the group lacked standing.\n\n\u201cWhat about the others in the class,\u201d asked Donnelly, about the possibility they would suffer \u201cirreparable damage\u201d if they were sent home. \u201cIf they had come here two days ago, we wouldn\u2019t be here, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has unfolded with such speed,\u201d Eastern District U.S. Attorney Susan Riley replied, on Trump\u2019s behalf, \u201cthat we haven\u2019t had an opportunity to address the issues, the important legal issues.\u201d\n\nOr, as some of the hundreds of Brooklynites protesting outside of the courthouse might have put it less formally, \u201cbeats the shit out of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people were caught in transit,\u201d American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt argued, adding that he\u2019d been informed during the hearing, slightly after 8:00 p.m., that \u201cwe just got word that the government is threatening to put someone on a plane at 9:20.\u201d He added a few minutes later, he\u2019d just then been told that person is a Syrian, who would be sent back to that war-ravaged nation.\n\nDonnelly pressed the government on how it could claim those already vetted and now suddenly rejected by the United States wouldn\u2019t suffer \u201cirreparable harm\u201d if they \u201cwere sent back to some of the most dangerous places on earth.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not a trick question, but one part of the four-part balancing act a judge must use to decide on a request to halt such an order. Again, the government\u2019s lawyers didn\u2019t even attempt a real answer, just went on for a bit about how many different people with different circumstances would be affected in many different ways by the order.\n\nAsked how many people had been detained, Riley said: \u201cThe government does not have sufficient information to answer.\u201d\n\nDonnelly had heard enough.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m going to grant\u201d the ACLU\u2019s request, she ruled at about 9 p.m.\u2014with perhaps 20 minutes to spare for the unknown Syrian.\n\nThe judge then noted drily that \u201cI don\u2019t think the government has really had a chance to think about this,\u201d and asked if they could return to court next Friday morning to discuss the issues now that she\u2019d granted the emergency motion, \u201cIs that too soon?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes it is, your honor.\u201d\n\nThe parties will meet again in mid-February, with the order ensuring that those now detained will not be deported until the government attorneys have had their chance to think about this, and the court then rules on their arguments.\n\nMeantime, the ACLU\u2019s Gelernt noted, that \u201cit sounds like the government is going to keep all these people in detention,\u201d adding that \u201cthey\u2019re not letting us see all the people in the airport.\u201d He asked for a list of them.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know. People are coming in all the time,\u201d said Riley.\n\nDonnelly ordered a list be provided, adding \u201cif there is somebody\u201d\u2014like the Syrian\u2014\u201cwho is in danger of being removed, I direct you to communicate that we have a stay.\u201d\n\n\u2018The whole point of this hearing is to preserve the status quo,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't think it's unduly burdensome to identify people we are talking about here.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the status quo was preserved for at least a few more days \u2014 at least if the Trump administration respects the court's order. In an emergency motion for clarification and enforcement filed early Monday morning, the ACLU warned of \"repeated reports of individual members subject to the Order who have been placed on planes, possibly deported, and subject to intimidation to sign removal orders after the issuance of the Court\u2019s Order.\"\n\nOne U.S. Attorney, the group said, \"refused to confirm that Respondents would respect the Order nationwide.\"\n\nThese are Trump\u2019s new functionaries, wrestling with how to justify the unjustifiable once they're summoned back to court. Beats the shit out of me.", "description": "Federal judge stays part of Trump\u2019s immigration ban after flustered U.S. attorney admits government didn\u2019t have time to think through \u2018important legal issues.\u2019", "authors": ["Harry Siegel", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1491846613/articles/2017/01/28/judge-blocks-part-of-trump-s-immigration-ban-after-his-own-lawyers-can-t-justify-it/170128-zavadski-seigel-aclu-stay-tease_rpuf1h", "published_at": "2017-01-29"}
