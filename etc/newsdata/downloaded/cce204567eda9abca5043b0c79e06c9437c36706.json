These issues have already begun to surface and we expect they will accelerate.\n\nBloom\u2019s tricky accounting allows it to mask servicing costs and shift write-downs to other periods, thereby avoiding recognizing major recent additional losses.\n\nWe believe that large debt maturities in 2020 and 2021, amounting to nearly $520 million, make Bloom Energy an obvious bankruptcy candidate.\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d narrative is absurd: our research shows that Bloom Energy servers emit significantly more CO2 than the electric grid in key states where it operates. Its emissions are comparable to those of modern natural gas power plants.\n\nCourt documents reveal that Bloom self-identified as a \u201clarge quantity generator of hazardous waste,\u201d to the EPA. Bloom was even sued in 2016 over alleged deceptive trade practices relating to the dumping of its hazardous waste in California landfills.\n\nBloom has collected over $1.1 billion in federal, state, and local subsidies. Many of these subsidies are being withdrawn or stepped down as jurisdictions wise up to the reality of Bloom\u2019s products.\n\nA former Bloom employee and a fuel cell expert told us, respectively, that Bloom \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t exist today\u201d without subsidies and that Bloom \u201churts the fuel cell industry overall\u201d.\n\nBloom executives have a history of making allegedly false statements, including ones it was forced to retract in SEC filings. In another case, Bloom paid $16.7 million to settle allegations that it lied to its brokers.\n\nInitial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in shares of Bloom. This report represents our opinion, and we encourage every reader to do their own due diligence. Please see our full disclaimer at the bottom of the report.\n\nPart I: Bloom\u2019s Fantasy Origins\n\nThe market appears to be slowly waking up to the same unfortunate conclusion about Bloom Energy that we have arrived at after several months of rigorous deep dive research. Instead of being a great clean energy success, we expect Bloom\u2019s \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d story will find its place in history along the likes of defunct companies such as Solyndra and Theranos.\n\nBloom is a technology company that develops and manufactures stationary fuel cell systems. Bloom\u2019s systems, called \u201cBloom Boxes\u201d, are essentially generators that businesses can use to create on-site energy using solid oxide fuel cells, a technology that has been around for almost a hundred years.\n\nThe boxes take an input, usually natural gas, and convert it into usable electricity.\n\nBloom Energy servers or \u201cBloom Boxes\u201d (Picture credit: Apple Insider)\n\nFuel cells, in general, have been understood by the scientific community since the early 1800\u2019s and have been a largely unprofitable industry to date. Much of Bloom\u2019s popularity (and funding) was based on the idea that it could \u201cbreak through\u201d as the first profitable and sustainable fuel cell company, they had a solid business idea that would be able to provide Business Utilities at a fraction of the price the business was originally paying for their utilities.\n\nThe company was founded in 2001 by KR Sridhar, a well-credentialed scientist who developed fuel cell technology at NASA before launching Bloom, quickly gaining the support of brand-name venture capitalists, such as Kleiner Perkins.\n\nBy early 2008, a Department of Energy report [1] ranking solid oxide fuel cell projects by effectiveness placed Bloom\u2019s dead last by a wide margin:\n\nNonetheless, later that year, the company booked a high-profile Kleiner Perkins alumni as its first customer: Google. The search behemoth installed a 400 kW Bloom system at its main campus that year (and doesn\u2019t appear to have expanded its relationship with Bloom since).\n\nBloom\u2019s big unveiling to the public took place in 2010 on national television. Upon its release, Bloom was heralded as a scientific breakthrough by a litany of the nation\u2019s top non-scientists. Senator Dianne Feinstein declared of Bloom:\n\n\u201cThis technology is fundamentally going to change the world.\u201d\n\nOther notable non-scientists, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Secretary of State George Schultz (of Theranos infamy), and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who is a current Bloom board member, voiced their full-throated support for the company.\n\nThat same year, 60 Minutes ran a puff piece on Bloom, introducing the program by saying \u201cin a world of energy, the holy grail is a power source that\u2019s inexpensive and clean, with no emissions.\u201d\n\nWith the wind at its back, Bloom rolled out its product to a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of Fortune 100 companies, including AT&T and Home Depot, regularly guaranteeing them long-term attractive energy prices with agreements that lasted up to 25 years. These agreements placed the risk of the company\u2019s fuel cell performance squarely on Bloom and its shareholders. Many customers, seeing the attractive guarantees, took the deals and held up their Bloom Boxes as evidence of a commitment to green, clean, and sustainable energy.\n\nIt was a storied beginning to a company that was slated to revolutionize global energy and change the world as we know it.\n\nBut nearly a decade later, the company has been unable to fulfill its ambitions of being profitable and the realities of our research have led us to one conclusion: We expect Bloom Energy will become yet another tombstone in the Silicon Valley cemetery of dead unicorns.\n\nBloom\u2019s Operational Reality: An Emissions-Spewing, Hazardous Waste-Creating, Uneconomical Product That is Failing in The Real World\n\nLet\u2019s start off our series of inconvenient truths by making one thing clear: Bloom has never been a \u201cgreen\u201d energy company.\n\nWhile being capable of running on biogas (a form of genuine green energy), 91% of the company\u2019s fuel cell products run on natural gas (a non-renewable fossil fuel). [Pg. 5]\n\nBloom is also not a \u201cclean\u201d energy company. Instead of reducing emissions, data we collected from hundreds of Bloom projects shows that they generate more CO2 than the electric grid in key states they operate in and produce CO2 levels comparable to modern natural gas power plants.\n\nBloom\u2019s generators also result in the creation of carcinogenic hazardous waste, which the company has allegedly improperly dumped into public landfills. Lawsuit exhibits reveal that Bloom labeled itself with the EPA as a \u201clarge quantity generator\u201d of hazardous waste. The exhibits include pictures of Bloom employees wearing respirators as they handle 55-gallon drums of what appears to be hazardous waste from emptied/cleaned collection canisters.\n\nTo make matters worse, the company has procured over $1.1 billion in federal, state, and local subsidies, often under the auspices of being green, clean, or renewable. As we will show, Bloom is none of these and lately, multiple states have wised up and begun to withdraw or step-down subsidies as a result \u2013 a move that we expect will further cripple Bloom\u2019s business model.\n\nBloom\u2019s Economic Reality: Never Been Profitable, No Expected 2020 Revenue Growth, An Estimated $2+ Billion Undisclosed Servicing Liability and Losing Subsidies\n\nAstonishingly, Bloom has never been profitable despite its significant historical revenue growth and despite receiving over $1.1 billion in subsidies.\n\nThis chart shows Bloom\u2019s quarterly net results, inclusive of its historic tailwinds:\n\n(Source: Company financials)\n\nWith the company\u2019s \u201cbag of tricks\u201d now empty and newly offered tepid guidance, we expect these red bars to drop materially lower going forward.\n\nRecent Conference Call: No Revenue Growth For 2020. The company recently acknowledged that it expects no revenue growth next year. Bloom hoped to achieve manufacturing economies of scale to lower costs and enhance its profitability, but in the absence of growth, high overhead will further imperil profitability.\n\nSubsidies Disappearing. Subsidies are disappearing entirely or being stepped down over time. We estimate that the stepping down of the Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), for example, will represent $247 million in foregone subsidies over the next 3 years.\n\nBloom\u2019s Unsustainable Debt Burden: Large 2020 and 2021 Maturities Make this an Obvious Bankruptcy Candidate\n\nBloom\u2019s debt situation has reached unsustainable levels. Per its most recently quarterly report, Bloom has just $308 million in cash on hand, down from $325.1 million in December 2018. By the end of 2020, $379.2 million in debt is coming due, with significant 2021 maturities thereafter:\n\nPer the same quarterly report, the company now has $701.3 million in total debt, with $431.7 million of that total listed as recourse debt.\n\nThe largest chunk of the company\u2019s debt is $296.2 million from its 6% convertible promissory notes due December 2020. These notes present a problem for the company, as the conversion price is now far out of the money, at $11.25 per share. This likely means that, upon maturity, Bloom will have to put up the cash, unless it can enter into a refinancing (which would likely be on toxic terms).\n\nBeyond the debt, we have also uncovered another massive liability, seemingly unknown to the investing public, that we believe will seal Bloom\u2019s demise.\n\nBloom Energy Has an Estimated $2.2 Billion In Undisclosed Servicing Liabilities That We Expect Will Sink the Business\n\nThe Crux of the Problem: Bloom Places Itself on the Hook for the Long-Term Performance of Its Systems (And Field Data Shows They Don\u2019t Last Long)\n\nBacking up for a moment, one might ask\u2014how does a new, relatively unproven company like Bloom manage to sell so many fuel cell systems to so many Fortune 100 companies, when fuel cell economics have repeatedly failed in the real world?\n\nThe answer is that Bloom\u2019s contracts guarantee baseline performance levels\u2014essentially locking in the price of electricity for its customers. Per Bloom\u2019s marketing literature:\n\n\u201cWe offer the ability to lock in cost for electric power (other than the price of natural gas) over the long-term\u2026we provide a solution that includes all of the fixed-equipment and maintenance costs for the life of the contract.\u201d\n\nThese contracts place nearly 100% of the risk on Bloom and are very long-term\u2014typically lasting from 10 to 21 years [Pg. 101] and lasting as long as 25 years. [Pg. 14]\n\nThis is an incredibly attractive deal for customers, who can (and do) tout their forward-thinking ways while also locking in cheap electricity.\n\nConversely, what this means for Bloom is that when the electrical output of its systems decline\u2014they are on the hook to replace them. Bloom has noted this as a key risk in its filings:\n\n\u201cIf our estimates of useful life for our Energy Servers are inaccurate or we do not meet service and performance warranties and guarantees, or if we fail to accrue adequate warranty and guaranty reserves, our business and financial results could be harmed.\u201d (10-Q Pg. 70)\n\nBloom is responsible for two types of replacements: its fuel cell servers (the system itself) and the individual fuel cells that go inside the servers.\n\nAs experts have confirmed to us, the high operating temperatures of solid oxide fuel cells (800C or 1400F, and higher) make them extremely susceptible to wear and tear.\n\nA fuel cell technician with 19 years of experience in the field made this clear to us and brought up what would be a recurring theme with multiple experts we spoke to, durability:\n\n\u201cBloom Energy is also a high temperature type application. They are using solid oxide fuel cells, which is a very temperamental fuel cell in the first place. High temperatures create a lot of issues whenever you\u2019re dealing with the expansion of different components in it. I mean, you\u2019re going up to 7-8-900 C. Whenever you\u2019re hitting those kinds of temperatures and then you\u2019re cooling back down, everything is expanding and contracting at different rates and those type of fuel cells suffer significantly from breakage through those varying thermal cycles.\u201d\n\nOur research has found that Bloom\u2019s fuel cells and systems degrade significantly faster than expectations, yet the company barely records any liability for these issues.\n\nNo One Seems to Have Noticed the Accounting Trick That Allows Bloom to Mask Its Liabilities: The Company Only Discloses 1 Year of Servicing Liabilities Despite Servicing Contracts that Last Up to 25 Years\n\nSo, how does Bloom justify largely ignoring its multi-year servicing liabilities?\n\nWe found a simple little line, buried on page 91 of Bloom\u2019s 10-K, that explains it. (Note that this line was NOT in the company\u2019s IPO prospectus):\n\n\u201cCustomers may renew the MSAs (master service agreements) leading to future expense that is not recognized under GAAP until the renewal occurs.\u201d [Pg. 91]\n\nAt first glance, this line looks rather benign. But what it means is that the company only books the next year of servicing liabilities, rather than accounting for the liabilities across the full 10-25 years of the contract.\n\nWhy? Because technically the customers have the option to renew their service contract every year that they could \u2013 technically \u2013 choose not to exercise. Per the same filing:\n\n\u201cThe warranty and guaranty may be renewed annually at the customer\u2019s option \u2013 as an operations and maintenance services agreement \u2013 at predetermined prices for a period of up to 25 years.\u201d [Pg. 39]\n\nThe obvious question is: why wouldn\u2019t they renew? What customer wouldn\u2019t push a \u2018free money\u2019 button that essentially guarantees them cheap, long-term electricity by renewing their service contract?\n\nEven Bloom acknowledges that customers don\u2019t cancel these agreements:\n\n\u201cvirtually no customers have elected to cancel their maintenance agreements\u201d [Prospectus Pg. 123]\n\nWe found zero examples of customers not renewing these service agreements. Nonetheless, Bloom records its servicing liabilities as if every customer will cancel every year. It\u2019s no surprise why this seems to have gone largely unnoticed given where it was buried in the financials:\n\nWe have contacted the company and asked about its servicing liability accounting, as well as the actual life of its new generation fuel cells and servers. We have not heard back as of this writing. Should we hear back, we will update this piece accordingly.\n\nBloom: \u201cWe Expect to Average Over Five Years Between (Fuel Cell) Replacements\u201d\n\nReality: Field Data Suggests Replacements Are Needed Before 3 Years, on Average\n\nWe have sourced extensive public data in order to track how Bloom\u2019s systems are actually performing.\n\nAs stated earlier, the major costs associated with Bloom\u2019s long-term service liabilities relate to degradation or damage to its (1) fuel cells and (2) fuel cell servers.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by discussing its fuel cells.\n\nBloom has claimed to have made big improvements to the life of its fuel cells, stating that fuel cells installed in 2017 and onward will have a lifespan of over five years:\n\n\u201cTime to stack replacement\u2019 primarily driven by our fuel cell stack lives\u2014in the early years, replacement was typically 12 to 18 months. Over the years we have made steady improvements in our fuel cell lives, and from 2017 onwards we expect to average over five years between replacements.\u201d [IPO Prospectus Pg. 61]\n\nWe have tracked data on Bloom projects installed since 2017 through state utility records in New York and California. There were 35 projects in all. After aggregating this data, we found that even Bloom\u2019s newest fuel cells will degrade below replacement thresholds in under 3 years, significantly below the company\u2019s \u201cexpectations\u201d. We present this data later in the report.\n\nOur findings were corroborated by multiple experts in the field who were highly skeptical of Bloom\u2019s claim that solid oxide fuel cells could last 5 years or longer in the field.\n\nWe asked one professional fuel cell technician, with 19 years of experience, whether he believed the company\u2019s claims to be able to run solid oxide fuel cells for 5 years. He responded with a curt \u201cno\u201d. When asked if the same fuel cells could operate for three years, he replied:\n\n\u201cDo I believe claims of 3 years before service is needed? No. I would be highly skeptical.\u201d\n\nAnother expert we contacted, with 14 years of experience working in Fuel Cells and Fuel Cell Performance Analysis, who also has a B.S., M.S., and a PhD in Chemical Engineering, also warned about temperature and durability preventing Bloom\u2019s cells from running for 5 years:\n\n\u201cThey are using the high temperature materials, I think. So, there is advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage is that degradation is probably high. I doubt they have 5 years life. They may have 1 or 2 max. They cannot achieve 5 years. Or maybe if they have to replace part of the stack, they can achieve 5 years. In general, it\u2019s really hard for SOFCs to run 5 years.\u201d\n\nBloom\u2019s Unrecorded Servicing Liabilities: Project Data Shows That Fuel Cells in The Field Will Need Replacement Far Quicker Than the Company Lets On\n\nKeep in mind that Bloom guarantees both the output (total electricity produced) and the efficiency (how much fuel is used to generate the electricity) of its servers:\n\n\u201c\u2026we typically provide an Output Guaranty of 95% measured annually and an Efficiency Guaranty of 52% measured cumulatively\u201d [Prospectus pg. 75]\n\nBloom also provides tighter 80% quarterly output guarantees or 45% monthly efficiency guarantees on some of its projects. [Prospectus pg. 88 and 89]\n\nEfficiency and output decline together: As the systems become less efficient, they produce less electricity, making efficiency degradation key to when fuel cells need to be replaced.\n\nAs we have seen from older Bloom project data in California and New York, fuel cell replacements were typically done in the 48%-50% efficiency range.\n\nThis chart, based on data from California and New York, shows how rapidly Bloom\u2019s newer post-2016 installed servers are declining by month, on average. It also shows how the trend continues:\n\n(Source: New York & California Utility Data & Author Analysis)\n\nAfter only 25 months, Bloom\u2019s newer fuel cell installations had deteriorated from a median starting efficiency of 58.3% down to 51.0%, a decline that puts them on pace to breach the 48% threshold with 34 months (less than three years).[1]\n\nThe chart also shows that 45% efficiency (which serves as a \u2018bare minimum\u2019 on some projects) will be breached after only 42 months, or 3.5 years.[2]\n\nThis multi-year difference between expectation and reality will translate to an estimated $1.87 billion in fuel cell replacement costs:\n\n(For a full breakdown of our calculations and data sourcing, see Appendix A)\n\nBloom\u2019s Unrecorded Servicing Liabilities: Bloom Estimates Its Fuel Cell Servers Last 15-21 Years\n\nNews Flash: They Don\u2019t. The Company Has Historically Replaced Servers After Just 4-7 Years\n\nMoving on to the liabilities associated with replacing Bloom\u2019s servers (as opposed to just the fuel cells), our first check was to see how long the company estimates they will last. Keep in mind that these systems run continuously at temperatures around 800C (or 1400F) in real-world conditions.\n\nBloom shows, in its depreciation schedule, that it expects its servers to last for 15-21 years [Pg. 95]:\n\nWe think this depreciation schedule is horribly askew from reality.\n\nFor instance, Bloom sold servers in 2010-2012 that lasted only 4-6 years. They had been replaced entirely by 2016. [Pg. F-39]\n\nBloom also installed servers in Delaware in 2012 that are now being replaced after just 7 years, as announced this past quarter. [Pg. 11]\n\nThe company itself acknowledged that it had failed to achieve its own estimates previously:\n\n\u201cEarly generations of our Energy Server did not have the useful life and did not perform at an output and efficiency level that we expected.\u201d [Pg. 70]\n\nWe are now being asked to trust the new estimates, which look to represent approximately a 3x improvement on prior server lifespans. Yet the company thoroughly disclaims its own estimates, declaring them to be a key risk factor:\n\n\u201cOur pricing of [customer] contracts and our reserves for warranty and replacement are based upon our estimates of the life of our Energy Servers and their components, including assumptions regarding improvements in useful life that may fail to materialize. We do not have a long history with a large number of field deployments, and our estimates may prove to be incorrect.\u201d [Pg. 70]\n\nFinally, our field research corroborates that Bloom\u2019s servers have experienced trouble in the real world.\n\nWe contacted several businesses to learn about the reliability of Bloom\u2019s new systems. A Home Depot in Greenbush, NY, told us that they had a system \u201cblow\u201d within a year of having it installed. New York utility records show that the system was new, operating since December 2018. They also appear to show sharp drop-offs in electricity generated, consistent with what we were told.\n\nWe were told that another Home Depot, in Clifton Park, NY, [operating since September 2018] had its server come right off the building shortly after its installation, according to the same conversation. (We share more details on this conversation, as well as conversations with other customers and experts, in Part IV of this report.)\n\nIn short, Bloom\u2019s expected server life is untested at best, and its history has demonstrated a 4-7 year lifespan.\n\nEven if we assume just 1 server replacement on an average outstanding contract life of 13 years, we estimate this to result in a nearly $1.5 billion unrecorded servicing liability:\n\n(Note: For a full breakdown of our calculations and data sourcing see Appendix A)\n\nBloom\u2019s Undisclosed $2.2 Billion Liability by The Numbers\n\nBloom has been cagey about disclosing the actual life of its fuel cells/servers and other metrics that would make its servicing liability clear to the market. In SEC comment letters, the company redacts such information.\n\nWe have reached out to the company and asked what their estimate of servicing liabilities would be when factoring in the full length of their contracts and have not heard back as of this writing.\n\nBelow is our full breakdown of Bloom\u2019s estimated undisclosed servicing liabilities, net of expected servicing revenue during that same time frame. For the full breakdown of our data collection and methodology, see Appendix A at the end of this report:\n\nOur overall view is that Bloom\u2019s economics are reliant on unrealistic assumptions about the useful life of its products. These are massive unnoticed liabilities that we expect will lead to materially adverse consequences for the company in the immediate future.\n\nIn fact, we have already begun to see this issue rear its head. However, rather than recognizing the reality of these costs, a troubling pattern has emerged where Bloom\u2019s costs have been masked by tricky accounting.\n\nServicing Liabilities Are Already Beginning to Show: Bloom\u2019s Accounting Methods Masked Service Losses and Juked Revenue Numbers in the Recent Quarter\n\nDuring the most recent quarter, Bloom disclosed it was commencing a project to \u201cdecommission\u201d 18MW worth of servers in Delaware. The servers are only about 7 years old, yet the company is aiming to replace all of them.\n\nAs we know from Bloom\u2019s service arrangements, the company is on the hook for the cost to replace servers. The company\u2019s agreement on the project in question makes this crystal clear:\n\n\u201cOperator\u2019s (i.e.: Bloom\u2019s) responsibilities hereunder shall include, without limitation, promptly correcting any Bloom System or BOF malfunctions, either by (i) recalibrating or resetting the malfunctioning Bloom System or BOF, or (ii) repairing or replacing Bloom System or BOF components which are defective, damaged, worn or otherwise in need of replacement.\u201d [Pg. 12]\n\nOne would think these unexpected server replacements would have represented a substantial hit to Bloom\u2019s servicing profitability in the quarter. Instead, we see that the company reported one of its healthiest servicing margins to date. How could this be?\n\n(Data in thousands. Source: Company financials)\n\nIn poring over the disclosures about the server replacements, we find that rather than replacing the servers and taking the hit to servicing margins as we would expect, Bloom instead engaged in a complex transaction that seems to avoid recognizing any servicing losses at all.\n\nInstead, the company claims to be \u201cselling\u201d new servers to the same project and BOOKING IT AS NEW REVENUE. [Pg. 35]\n\nAll told, we estimate the \u201cdecommissioning\u201d transaction, net of supposed \u2018new\u2019 revenue, will represent over $135 million in losses and cash out the door for Bloom in coming quarters.\n\nThe transaction is clearly cash flow negative and will represent a near-term loss to Bloom, yet its complexities mask the significance and the timing of the cash outlays. These complexities include:\n\n$57.5 million to buy out equity in the project from one of Bloom\u2019s financing partners [Pg. 33] Post upgrade, Bloom\u2019s remaining financing partner will receive 100% of the revenues from the new servers and Bloom will receive none! This makes Bloom\u2019s newly purchased \u2018equity\u2019 a seemingly worthless piece of paper. [Pg. 33]\n\n$40 million in cash collateral, posted by Bloom, to indemnify against up to $97.2 million in legal, regulatory, and tax liabilities. Presumably, the partner views the risks of these liabilities as material, given the high cash collateral, but Bloom has reserved nothing for them. [Pg. 34]\n\n$57.2 million in other liabilities, assumed by Bloom, that are vaguely contingent on Bloom\u2019s stock price. [Pg. 34] [Pg. 23-F]\n\n$72.3 million, paid by Bloom, as a partial payment to \u201crepurchase\u201d its old servers. [Pg. 33]\n\nDespite these significant cash outlays and assumption of liabilities, the decommissioning transaction created the appearance of positive top line growth. In the recent quarter, Bloom booked $91.7 million from the supposed \u2018sales\u2019 to replace its old servers, representing almost 40% of the revenue in the quarter. [Pg. 35]\n\nThis type of absurd transaction strikes us as textbook financial engineering. We find it incredibly suspicious that, despite the transaction affecting numerous income statement items, it looks to have avoided impacting \u2018servicing\u2019 items entirely.\n\nBloom\u2019s Accounting Methods Mask Service Losses and Juke Revenue Numbers: Part Two\n\nThis is not the first time Bloom has employed this type of accounting alchemy.\n\nIn Bloom\u2019s IPO prospectus, it disclosed replacing 172 early generation servers in 2016 [Pg. 66]. Once again, Bloom recorded the server replacements as NEW sales and classified cash outlays as investments instead of taking a servicing loss.\n\nBloom achieved this by determining that the server replacements involved such significant renegotiation of its old leases that it actually constituted a termination of the lease. We believe this, in turn, conveniently allowed them to book substantial write-downs in the pre-IPO period (where investors couldn\u2019t see the write-down) while booking new revenue that improved the financials disclosed publicly in the IPO.\n\n\u201cSince the underlying assets under the arrangement were replaced (i.e., new generation Energy Servers were installed in place of the decommissioned older generation Energy Servers), the decommissioning of Energy Servers under the program did not constitute a lease modification, and was accounted for as a lease termination. Through December 31, 2017, the Company has replaced 196 Energy Servers with new generation Energy Servers sold as part of a new sales arrangement.\u201d [Prospectus F-39]\n\n\u201cDuring 2015, the Company recorded a reduction in product revenue totaling $41.8 million for the decommissioning of its PPA I Energy Servers.\u201d [Prospectus F-39]\n\n\u201cIn 2016 and 2017, 172 and 0 respectively, of our acceptances achieved were for Energy Servers that were sold to existing customers under our PPA I decommissioning program.\u201d [Prospectus 66]\n\nWe find it incredibly alarming that Bloom seems to be engaging in transactions that avoid recognizing servicing losses in a forthright manner that is transparent to investors\u2014or in some cases, recognizing them at all.\n\nThe Edge of the Cliff: Why We Think These Servicing Issues are An Imminent Problem\n\nWe believe that this absurd juggling act is coming to an end and will culminate in an erosion of the company\u2019s remaining cash over the next 6-12 months.\n\nFor starters, the company isn\u2019t done replacing outdated servers and has acknowledged that it needs to secure $92 million in financing to finish the latest batch of replacements [Pg. 32]\n\nWe have also begun to see a slew of \u2018one time\u2019 charges and write-downs that we fully expect will continue in relation to upcoming server replacements. From the recent quarter alone [Pg. 35]:\n\n\u201cWe had repurchased and written-off 10.0 megawatts of our earlier generation energy servers for $25.6 million\u201d \u201cWe recognized charges related to the decommissioning of PPA II Energy Servers of $8.1 million\u201d \u201cAdditionally, in paying-off the outstanding debt and interest of PPA II amounting to $77.7 million, we incurred a debt payoff make-whole penalty of $5.9 million\u201d \u201cWe had PPA II debt issuance costs written-off of $1.0 million and additional interest expense incurred for PPA 2 debt payoff of $0.1 million\u201d\n\nFinally, we took the current efficiency of Bloom\u2019s California and New York projects, roughly 200 in all, and found that almost 15% of its projects likely need imminent fuel cell replacements, with almost 40% needing replacements within an estimated 14 months.\n\n(Source: New York & California Utility Records & Author Analysis)\n\nExtrapolating this data out, we estimate a $55 million imminent replacement liability with another estimated $147 million replacement liability over the next 14 months. Once again, this is just relating to fuel cell liabilities and does not include additional server replacement liabilities.\n\nThe Edge of the Cliff: Bloom\u2019s Servicing Liabilities Had Historically Been Masked by Strong Revenue Growth. That Growth Is Now Gone\n\nThe reason Bloom\u2019s issues are now bubbling to the surface is a lack of new revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s revenue model is heavily \u2018front-loaded\u2019. When the company sells a new fuel cell system, it collects 3 forms of revenue immediately:\n\nProduct revenue (for the physical fuel cell systems) Installation revenue The first year of service revenue in advance. [Pg. 61] (Bloom also usually gets another 1-2 years of servicing revenue before needing to replace systems, giving it up to 3 years of front-loaded servicing revenue.)\n\nAfter this jolt of initial revenue, Bloom collects a small ongoing annual servicing fee, but is required to carry the burden of all servicing liabilities.\n\nThe company has reported strong historical revenue growth, which has allowed its servicing liabilities to appear small relative to the influx of new money.\n\n(Source: Company financials)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Bloom acknowledged that it expects no revenue growth in 2020. The tide has gone out. Without new revenue, we expect the replacement liabilities to quickly represent larger and larger proportions of Bloom\u2019s cost structure.\n\nAll told, we see a significant deterioration in Bloom\u2019s cash balance and net income over the next year. With a large chunk of debt coming due by the end of 2020, we simply don\u2019t see a silver lining here.\n\nPart II: Bloom Energy is a Carbon Polluter and a Hazardous Waste Producer Masquerading as a Clean Energy Company\n\nPutting aside economic sustainability, one of the biggest misconceptions about Bloom Energy is the idea that the company is providing clean, green and/or renewable energy. As we\u2019ll lay out now in detail, this argument is severely misguided at best and deceptive at worst.\n\nBloom and its customers have consumed over a billion dollars in federal, state, and municipal clean energy subsidies, yet Bloom emits more CO2 than the grid in key states it operates. In fact, our findings show that the amount of CO2 Bloom Energy servers release into the air is comparable to modern natural gas power plants.\n\nCorporations and governments have begun to wise up to Bloom\u2019s claims on the environmental benefits of its products. Santa Clara California has essentially banned new Bloom Energy natural gas installations through recent legislation. New Jersey pulled the rug on subsidies to Bloom and other fuel cell providers. [Pg. 16] California is ending its program that subsidizes fuel cell manufacturers. [1,2,3]\n\nWould Bloom be alive today without receiving over $1 billion in subsidies based on misconceptions around its product? Experts we spoke with, as we will detail later in this piece, believe the answer to this question is \u201cno\u201d.\n\nBloom Produces Significantly MORE Emissions Than the Grid in Most States in Which It Operates\n\nWe compiled the average CO2 grid emissions in the states where Bloom primarily operates. The majority of Bloom\u2019s domestic deployments are in just 5 states (California, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey & Delaware).\n\nAs can be seen in the chart below, Bloom is far dirtier than most of the states it operates in. In Delaware, a state that is powered 98.6% by fossil fuels such as gas, coal, and oil, Bloom is only marginally better:\n\n(Source: 2016 EPA eGRID summary tables, table #3)\n\nBloom Falsely Claims That Its Servers Running on Natural Gas Produce 50% Less Emissions than the U.S. Electric Grid\n\nBloom claimed in its prospectus:\n\n\u201cWhen running on natural gas, compared to average emissions across the U.S. grid, Bloom Energy Servers reduce carbon emissions by over 50%.\u201d [Prospectus Pg. 4]\n\nThis statement appears to be outright false, and by a wide margin. According to the latest official figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. grid emits 1,009 lbs/MWh of CO2.\n\nBloom\u2019s own marketing documents show that its servers produce 679-883 lbs/MWh of CO2, a 12.5% to 32% reduction from the grid average.\n\nOur own review of 205 Bloom projects in New York and California showed that they are producing an average of 835 lbs/MWh of CO2, a reduction of about 17.2% from the grid.\n\nBloom\u2019s Carbon Emissions: Comparable to Those of a Modern Natural Gas Power Plant\n\nNot only do we believe Bloom\u2019s statements about emissions relative to the grid to be outright false, but comparing Bloom with \u201cthe grid\u201d is the wrong comparison in the first place. The grid is dirty and old. Coal accounts for about 75 percent of the grid\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and the average U.S. coal power plant is over 40 years old.\n\nA proper comparison would be between a new natural gas-operated Bloom system and a modern natural gas power plant. Using data from the U.S. Department of Energy, we plotted data from Bloom\u2019s new generation systems relative to the average for a modern combined cycle natural gas power plant.\n\n(Source: Department of Energy, New York & California Utility Records, And Author Calculations)\n\nThe numbers are comparable. Bloom\u2019s newest generation systems emit roughly 839 lbs/CO2 per MWh on average versus a modern natural gas plant that produces 896 lbs/CO2 per mWh. [Pg. 18] The average across all 205 Bloom outstanding projects in New York and California was also comparable at ~835 lbs/CO2 per MWh.\n\nNote that as Bloom\u2019s systems age and efficiency goes down, they produce more CO2. (See the appendix for the inverse relationship between efficiency and emissions.) According to the data we reviewed, after only about 24 months, Bloom\u2019s systems will produce CO2 levels on par with modern combined cycle natural gas plants (and then perform worse thereafter).\n\nBloom Also Wrongly Compares Its Emissions to the \u201cMarginal Grid\u201d (We\u2019ll Explain), Painting Another False Picture of Its Emissions\n\nBloom has deflected questions on its emissions by attempting to compare itself to the \u201cmarginal grid\u201d rather than the actual electric grid. So, what is the difference?\n\nThere are 2 types of power that feed the grid: baseload power and peak power.\n\nBaseload power is the type of power that is meant to meet the normal demands of the grid and is simply not easy to shut on or off. (An example is a nuclear plant which takes significant time to \u201cshut off\u201d once a nuclear chain reaction is commenced.) Peak power (\u201cmarginal grid\u201d) is the type of power that is turned on or off during periods of peak usage (such as during the dead of winter when people are using a lot of heat). Peak power tends to be far dirtier because of the inefficiencies introduced by starting and stopping the generation process. When the term \u201cmarginal grid\u201d is used, it typically refers to peak power sources.\n\nBloom is clearly baseload power\u2014after all, the first thing the company\u2019s marketing documents tout is how it is \u201calways on\u201d:\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem to be by choice. Multiple experts we spoke with noted that Bloom\u2019s solid oxide fuel cells run into major issues if they are not \u201calways on\u201d. As we\u2019ve noted, the systems operate at temperatures of 800C (or 1400F), and higher. If shut off, the drop in temperature can crack and break the ceramics and materials in the fuel cells.\n\nNonetheless, Bloom has repeatedly, and wrongly, compared itself to the very dirty \u201cmarginal\u201d peak power sources, which make its technology seem cleaner on a relative basis.\n\nWe saw this in a recent interview with Bloom CEO KR Sridhar that aired in early September 2019. When an NBC Bay Area anchor questions Bloom\u2019s emissions relative to the grid, Sridhar responds:\n\n\u201c\u2026we are lower in carbon footprint than the marginal grid, even in a state like California which is very clean\u2026\u201d\n\n[CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEO]\n\nThis statement is technically true, but in the most incorrect way possible.\n\nAs shown in the earlier chart, Bloom\u2019s systems are about 59% DIRTIER than the grid in California when you don\u2019t slip the word \u201cmarginal\u201d into the sentence.\n\nBloom used the same type of \u2018marginal\u2019 misdirection when it was fighting regulations in Santa Clara California that sought to curb new carbon emissions. Santa Clara rightly rejected the argument. (See an article on the subject here or view the city council meeting video at the 3:20:35 mark.)\n\nSanta Clara, California: We Are Moving Toward Fully Renewable Energy\n\nBloom\u2019s Response: This is a De Facto BAN on our Product\n\nThe fight between Bloom and Santa Clara serves as an example of Bloom outright rejecting renewables.\n\nOn May 7, 2019, the Santa Clara City Council required that new fuel cell projects in Santa Clara use renewable biogas. This was effectively viewed as a \u201cban\u201d of Bloom Energy, as the company was forced to concede that the requirement to use biogas meant that Bloom Energy Servers were infeasible. From Bloom\u2019s own petition:\n\n\u201c\u2026the Resolution effectively bars residents and businesses in Santa Clara from installing Petitioner\u2019s fuel cells unless the fuel cells are powered by renewable fuels sourced solely from within the State. It is infeasible, however, to satisfy this condition because renewable biogas sourced solely from within the State is virtually non?existent as a reliable fuel source or prohibitively expensive for a commercial user.\u201d\n\nRather than committing to move toward renewables, Bloom instead enlisted high-powered law firms to engage in aggressive lobbying and ultimately litigation in an effort to get Santa Clara to change course from renewables.\n\nBloom Servers Accumulate Hazardous Waste, Including Cancer-Causing Benzene\n\nIt turns out CO2 isn\u2019t the only byproduct of Bloom\u2019s systems.\n\nIn July 2018, Bloom disclosed that the EPA was seeking to collect $1m in fines from the company related to its disposal of benzene, which is hazardous waste found in Bloom\u2019s desulfurization containers. [Pg. 36] The company stated in its prospectus that it was contesting the fine, and does not anticipate \u2018significant\u2019 additional costs or risks from compliance with the latest guidance on hazardous waste disposal.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined that benzene causes cancer. Long-term exposure to high levels of benzene in the air can cause leukemia, cancer of the blood-forming organs.\n\nBloom\u2019s S-1 from July 2018 seems to play down its exposure to benzene:\n\n\u201c\u2026 natural gas, which is the primary fuel used in our Energy Servers, contains benzene, which is classified as a hazardous waste if it exceeds 0.5 milligrams (mg) per liter. A small amount of benzene (equivalent to what is present in one gallon of gasoline in an automobile fuel tank which is exempt from federal regulation) found in the public pipeline natural gas is collected by gas cleaning units contained in our Energy Servers and is typically replaced once every 18 to 24 months by us from customers\u2019 sites.\u201d\n\nThe above clever wording describes the relatively low levels of benzene found in natural gas. What is not clearly conveyed, however, is that Bloom\u2019s servers collect these small amounts of benzene over long periods, eventually resulting in large quantities of the hazardous waste.\n\nBloom Has Been Sued for Allegedly Dumping Benzene in California Landfills. Court Documents Show Bloom Labeled Itself a \u201cLarge Quantity Generator of Hazardous Waste\u201d\n\nIn 2016, corporate waste management company Unicat Services sued Bloom, alleging breach of contract. Unicat had been hired to clean and dispose of Bloom\u2019s waste canisters in public landfills but discovered that the canisters contained \u201cextremely hazardous\u201d and \u201ctoxic\u201d material. In the lawsuit, Unicat alleged that Bloom had been dumping benzene into the ground in California instead of disposing of it properly.\n\nFor a company that has built its reputation on claims of being environmentally friendly, this lawsuit essentially alleges that Bloom doesn\u2019t care about the environment. From the complaint:\n\n\u201cUnicat Services was told [by Bloom] that Bloom Energy had the contents of the fuel cell canisters emptied, canisters cleaned, and the extracted contents sent to public landfills for non?hazardous waste in Mexico and California. Unicat Services planned on doing the same operation in Alvin, Texas\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBloom Energy had effectively represented in 2013 that all of the canister contents was nonhazardous and could be dumped at any public landfill (the process Bloom Energy told Unicat Services was being done in California and Mexico).\u201d\n\n\u201cAs it has been trained by Bloom Energy, Unicat Services planned on emptying the canister contents into the nearby roll?off box and to transport the same to a public landfill as represented had been done in Mexico and California. However, prior to taking the shipment to a public landfill, [Unicat] as a matter of professionalism and best?practices, decided to test the contents\u2014just to be sure that it was safe to take to a public landfill. Their tests revealed that the Bloom Energy fuel cell canisters that Bloom Energy had transported to Unicat Services (and, according to Bloom Energy, had been previously emptied in Mexico and California and dumped in public landfills) contained an extremely hazardous and toxic material \u2013 benzene, which can cause blood cancers under long exposures, and which is a material clearly classified as hazardous by federal and state environmental authorities.\u201c\n\nThe complaint showed that rather than rewarding Unicat for helping correct a major environmental issue, Bloom tried to use it as leverage against Unicat:\n\n\u201cUnicat Services would have thought that an advertised \u201cgreen\u201d company like Bloom Energy would have rewarded Unicat Services for bringing to Bloom Energy\u2019s attention the hazardous waste in Bloom Energy\u2019s fuel cell canisters so that Bloom Energy would not expose the environment and people to dangerous toxins.\u201c\n\n\u201cInstead of rewarding Unicat Services for flagging the benzene to Bloom Energy, Bloom Energy used this as a renegotiating hammer to lower the per canister price that Unicat Services could charge\u2026\u201d\n\nAppended to the court documents were exhibits that confirm that Bloom is, in fact, collecting large quantities of hazardous waste.\n\nFor example, in signed court exhibits for Bloom Energy filed with the EPA, the company calls itself a \u201cLarge Quantity Generator\u201d of hazardous or industrial waste.\n\nThe waste Bloom generates falls under 4 EPA codes (D018, D007, D008, D001) which, according to the EPA hazardous waste codes, represent \u201cBenzene\u201d, \u201cChromium\u201d, \u201cLead\u201d, and \u201cIgnitable waste\u201d, respectively.\n\nAttached to those same court documents, per an e-mail from a Bloom Energy employee, are photographs of the \u201cemptying/cleaning process of canisters\u201d.\n\nThe employees undertaking the \u201cemptying/cleaning process\u201d are handling 55-gallon drums wearing what appear to be respirators.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled confidentially.\n\nThis hazardous waste generation seems to be starkly at odds with Bloom\u2019s public image. For example, in Bloom\u2019s marketing video touting its relationship with the city of Hartford, Connecticut, it refers to its technology as \u201cclean, reliable power without pollutants.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s our simple thought: before Bloom or Bloom customers receive any more government subsidies, we urge authorities to investigate the allegedly illegal toxic benzene dumping by the company.\n\nBloom Has Consumed $1.1+ Billion in Subsidies, Often Under Questionable Pretenses. Now, Jurisdictions Have Pulled the Subsidy Rug Out from Under the Company\n\nAs noted earlier, Bloom has consumed over $1.1 billion in subsidies on the Federal, state, and local level, often under the incorrect auspices of being green, clean and/or renewable.\n\nThe company\u2019s subsidies in California and New Jersey were curtailed after the states determined they were not contributing to green energy goals.\n\n(For a detailed state-by-state breakdown of Bloom\u2019s subsidies see Appendix B.)\n\nDelaware: Bloom Sold Us a Bill of Goods\n\nIn Delaware, the state and its residents have largely had a case of \u2018buyer\u2019s remorse\u2018 after forking over $221 million (and counting) to Bloom in the form of grants and subsidies.\n\nAfter a lobbying effort by the company, Delaware changed legislation so that Bloom\u2019s natural gas systems could be considered \u201crenewable energy\u201d. The state has since come under much criticism for the subsidy, with Delaware State Senator David Lawson declaring:\n\n\u201cI think we were sold a bill of goods.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Foundation documented the Delaware \u201cBloom Energy Boondoggle\u201d in thorough detail in this hour long presentation:\n\n[CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEO]\n\nBloom Has Complained That Green Energy Regulations Are Threatening Its Business and Subsidies\n\nBloom has recently made it even clearer that it should never receive subsidies under the auspices of being \u201cgreen\u201d. On Bloom\u2019s most recent conference call, CEO Sridhar said that green energy legislation in states like California and New York is creating \u201cconfusion\u201d for its customers.\n\nWe disagree\u2014 the only confusion seems to have been the perception that Bloom\u2019s natural gas-fueled systems were ever green in the first place.\n\nContrary to Bloom\u2019s complaint, the green legislation itself seems quite clear\u2014states like New York, California, Connecticut, and New Jersey are moving toward renewable energy:\n\nThis creates an obvious problem for Bloom, because the vast majority of its generators simply aren\u2019t renewable energy.\n\nCustomers Love \u201cGreenwashing\u201d With Bloom.\n\nHome Depot: Bloom Provides Us \u201cOn-Site Renewable Energy\u201d\u2026Such As Natural Gas\n\nWe agree with Bloom on one thing: its customers do appear to be confused.\n\nFor example, when Home Depot made an announcement in 2016 that it was working with Bloom, it called it a \u201crenewable\u201d energy source with \u201csignificantly less carbon emissions than traditional power sources.\u201d\n\nOnce again, natural gas is simply not renewable.\n\nHome Depot also parroted Bloom\u2019s false claim that it produces 50% less CO2 than the grid average. It then used this flawed metric to determine that installing Bloom\u2019s systems had taken the equivalent of 4,800 cars off the road.\n\nAs we have shown earlier, Bloom is actually far DIRTIER than the grid in states like New York and Connecticut, where Home Depot installed many Bloom systems.\n\nUnfortunately for Home Depot (and for the planet) it\u2019s more likely that installing Bloom Energy Servers in clean states like New York and Connecticut added thousands of cars to the road.\n\nThis is the ultimate version of virtue signaling and greenwashing, and it\u2019s all a result of what we believe to be a false narrative peddled by Bloom Energy.\n\nAT&T: \u201cOur Bloom Natural Gas Fuel Cells\u201d Count as an \u201cAlternative\u201d Energy Source\n\nEven though natural gas is hardly \u201calternative\u201d, AT&T has counted its partnership with Bloom as moving toward its alternative energy goals on its website.\n\nThe renewable energy angle to the Bloom story is that its servers are capable of running on biogas, though Bloom itself admits that biogas is expensive, isn\u2019t readily available enough, and is only used by a fraction of its customers.\n\nPart III: Bloom Energy Executives Have a History of Making Allegedly False Statements\n\nBeyond the questionable value of Bloom Energy\u2019s technology and the dubious \u201cclean energy\u201d value proposition advanced by the company, we also see some red flags with the executive team.\n\nThe Company was Forced to Correct False Statements Made by Its CEO on the Day of its IPO\n\nIn 2018, shortly after the company\u2019s initial public offering, its Chief Executive Officer, KR Sridhar, had statements he made on the record \u201cofficially disavowed\u201d after an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nWhen he was initially asked on the day of Bloom\u2019s IPO about the company\u2019s profitability, Sridhar told three MarketWatch staffers that Bloom was \u201ca profitable company as of [the second quarter],\u201d and he expected that to continue going forward.\n\nMarketWatch asked a follow-up question to clear up whether Sridhar meant GAAP terms, to which he answered \u201caffirmatively\u201d. MarketWatch then used those comments as the lead for a story published on July 26, 2018.\n\nThat statement turned out to be extremely incorrect:\n\n(Source: Company financials)\n\nFollowing the piece, MarketWatch was quickly contacted by a spokesperson for Bloom Energy with a \u201cclarification\u201d. The company explained to MarketWatch that Bloom expected to be GAAP profitable only on an operating basis, but not on a net basis.\n\nBut it turns out that wasn\u2019t true either.\n\nMarketWatch updated its story, but even then, the clarification \u2013 in addition to the original statements \u2013 were deemed misleading.\n\nBloom Energy followed the clarification by making another clarification, this time a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission itemizing its CEO\u2019s misstatements and correcting them one by one.\n\nMarketWatch then followed up with another piece summarizing its view of the experience:\n\nBloom Paid $16.7 Million to Settle Allegations That It Lied to Its Brokers, Leading to Their SEC Sanctioning\n\nIn 2009, brokerage firm Advanced Equities raised approximately $122M from 609 investors at a $1.45 billion valuation for Bloom Energy. During the fundraising process, Advanced Equities allegedly made several misstatements about Bloom Energy.\n\nAdvanced Equities and its founders were sued by the SEC in 2012 for those misstatements. The firm placed the blame on Bloom, claiming the company had \u201cmisled them and caused them to get sanctioned by the SEC.\u201d\n\nThe SEC lawsuit against Advanced Equities alleged a series of bald-faced lies and fabricated documents, including that:\n\n\u201c[Advanced Equities] misstated that [Bloom\u2019s] projected revenue of $2 billion \u201cis currently under contract and backordered\u201d. In reality, [Bloom] only had between $10m and $42m (10 to 42 individual hardware units) under contract as order backlog at that time.\u201d \u201c\u2026also misstated that [Bloom\u2019s] CEO had shown [Advanced Equities] emails with a \u201c$2 billion order from the CIA, which is not even in [Bloom\u2019s] numbers.\u201d In reality, [Bloom] did not have any order or other agreement from the CIA for any dollar amount at that time.\u201d \u201c[Advanced Equities] misstated again that [Bloom] was \u201cgetting $300m from the Department of Energy\u201d when in reality, [Bloom] had not yet received any funding from the Department of Energy and had only applied for a $96.8 million loan.\u201d\n\nAccording to a July 2018 Wall Street Journal article, founders of Advanced Equities had \u201cthreatened to sue Bloom, claiming that [Bloom] representatives were the sources of false information\u2026\u201d.\n\nAt the time, Bloom Energy denied those allegations but still settled with the founders of Advanced Equities, recording a $16.7M charge, according to documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nCo-founder of Advanced Equities, Dwight Badger, told the Wall Street Journal in 2018:\n\n\u201cI am currently under a confidentiality agreement\u2026 and [Bloom] is currently seeking to prevent me from releasing the information I have and claiming I breached the agreement, a charge I deny.\u201d\n\nPart IV: Experts, Customers and Competitors Reveal the Boring Truth About Bloom\u2019s Technology\n\nIn preparing this piece, we spoke with dozens of people including experts in the fuel cell industry, Bloom customers, competitors and former employees.\n\nOur discussions indicate that Bloom\u2019s technology is already well-understood, \u201cpretty old\u201d, and still faces two major hurdles: cost and durability.\n\n19 Year Fuel Cell Expert: Bloom\u2019s Technology \u201cHurts the Fuel Cell Industry\u201d and \u201cPublic Image (of Fuel Cells) Overall\u201d\n\nOne of the very first conversations we had was with a technician with 19 years of experience in the fuel-cell industry who has worked with everything from low temperature, low pressure hydrogen air/hydrogen oxygen PEM fuel cells to high pressure hydrogen oxygen aerospace-based fuel cells. His resume indicated a broad range of knowledge, from simple testing to advanced lead design for aerospace applications.\n\nWe approached him as objectively as possible, letting him know we wanted to hear both the good and the bad about the industry. When asked about Bloom Energy\u2019s contribution to the fuel cell space he didn\u2019t hold back his immediate distaste; his first response was a long sigh.\n\n\u201cNot very excited about Bloom Energy,\u201d he muttered, sounding disappointed. \u201cMy opinion on Bloom Energy is that they may have gotten out a little father ahead of themselves than they should have. Perhaps [they should have] spent a little more time in research and gotten a better handle on what they were wanting to do before they started bringing it to market.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cI feel like the general perception of Bloom Energy is that they kind of hurt the fuel cell industry as a whole.\u201d\n\nWhen we asked why he thought they were hurting the industry, he responded:\n\n\u201c\u2026they went out and made some pretty big bold claims, which would have been awesome if it had been 100% accurate, but it\u2019s looking like now that they made some claims and got some money for some ideas that looked good on paper, and didn\u2019t necessarily have a lot of credence to it. So, in my opinion, when you do that with the general public \u2013 when you promise them the moon, you better hit the moon. Whenever you make big bold claims, you better be able to follow them up \u2013 especially with something such as a temperamental R&D type subject as fuel cells. You only get the one shot and whenever you don\u2019t deliver, people aren\u2019t super forgiving whenever you invest a lot of money and don\u2019t deliver on everything you said. In short, my opinion is that they may have overstepped, and it is hurting the fuel cell public image overall.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about Bloom\u2019s push to raise money:\n\n\u201cThey were just making it very \u2018oh yeah, this is great, it\u2019s going to work, it\u2019s no questions\u2019. I understand why they did it, but at the same time you can\u2019t go to the public and say this is going great, this is going to work and not address the nuances\u2026\u201d\n\nHe also told us he thought Bloom had made these bold claims simply to raise money:\n\n\u201cFor money. For the money. It\u2019s my understanding they had tons of money coming in from capitalists that were interested in \u2013 it\u2019s kinda like, what is that show, Shark Tank? You go out and you make the pitch and if you make the pitch well enough; they\u2019re going to give money to you. If you don\u2019t make the pitch well enough, it\u2019s not so much. So, they were forced into making those kinds of bold claims to get the money.\u201d\n\nThe technician continued, telling us again how he thought this was bad for the industry as a whole:\n\n\u201cThe problem is when you make those bold claims and then you can\u2019t deliver, it really turns everything sour. And it\u2019d be one thing if it were just the investors, but they made it so public and so widespread, that\u2019s where I feel the disservice to the general industry was. I\u2019ve talked to multiple people that were not involved with fuel cells at all and you mention fuel cells and they\u2019re like, \u2018Ah, I don\u2019t know about that\u2019. \u2018You remember about 4-5 years ago Bloom Energy?\u2019. \u2018Bloom Energy, yeah I remember that. Did that work? Didn\u2019t that fall through or something?\u2019 That\u2019s not the image that the fuel cell industry needs.\u201d\n\nFinally, we asked his opinion on whether or not Bloom was ahead of the rest of the industry. He responded:\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I think Bloom Energy is only recognizable by name. I think your Ballard, your Plug Power, those are more industry leaders. They have more equipment out there. They\u2019re more involved with both the automotive and stationary applications. I think \u2013 and they\u2019re keeping a lower public profile until they can go and get a lot of good solid data. They actually have quite a few busses up and running on fuel cells.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really think Bloom just made the misstep of going too public, too fast and not having the \u2018ooh\u2019 and \u2018ahh\u2019 factor to maintain that approach,\u201d he concluded.\u201d\n\n14-Year Fuel Cell Expert in Performance Analysis: \u201cThey Use the Traditional Classic Materials\u201d\n\nWe also contacted another expert with 14 years of experience working in fuel cells and fuel cell performance analysis, who holds a B.S., M.S., and a PhD in Chemical Engineering. We asked him if he thought Bloom had any intellectual property that puts them ahead of new SOFC entrants. He responded:\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. These material developments are very real, very complicated and very fundamental. So, in SOFC, we\u2019ve made it better compared to 10 years ago. But I don\u2019t think there is revolutionary material [in Bloom\u2019s products]. Based on most of the disclosures, they\u2019re using the traditional materials. It\u2019s used in other fuel cells. They use the traditional classic materials.\u201d\n\nWe also asked about whether he thought the company\u2019s marketing was accurate. He told us:\n\n\u201cI see in some news they said they have 5 year stacks. My guess is they may have 2.5 or 3 year stacks. In that range. They probably have 50% [efficiency] they can reach for 3 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on their quarterly report, their cost is still much higher than other fuel cells. It\u2019s almost double in terms of cost. So that makes the electricity very high per kilowatt hour. I would say, probably triple the electricity of the classic generation. I would estimate their cost is probably 30 cents per kilowatt hour, based on my estimation and their costs.\u201d\n\nFinally, we asked if he thought Bloom could operate consistently and profitably without government incentives. He concluded:\n\n\u201cThat is very hard for all the fuel cells now. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\nPhD in Mechanical Engineering and Fuel Cell Expert: Fuel Cells Only Have a \u201c50/50 Chance of Making It Long Term\u201d\n\nWe also reached out to a U.S.-based PhD in mechanical engineering with research experience assessing the life cycle environmental impact of SOFC systems using energy systems modeling.\n\nWe asked for his take on whether or not fuel cells could make it in the long term and he was less than confident in his response. He also brought up durability and cost:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d personally like to give you a different answer, but I think based on the competition I\u2019m seeing from renewables and just conventional technologies, that I think fuel cells have a 50/50 chance making it long term. Again, the issues being lifetime and cost. The thing with lifetime is not only do you have to go through the maintenance part of it, but when you replace a stack you\u2019re basically paying for a whole new stack. So, lifetime and cost are also very much intertwined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the market, it also comes down to the cost. And I\u2019d say even more specifically to the lifecycle cost. So, there\u2019s a capital cost, right? And that\u2019s how much a system will cost up front. But then there\u2019s a lifecycle cost which includes not only the capital cost, which is that initial cost that you pay for the system, but it also includes the fuel cost, it also includes the cost to replace stacks over the lifetime. And so it\u2019s the lifecycle cost that I\u2019ve seen that is just not competitive at this point. It\u2019s much higher than internal combustion engines and microturbines.\u201d\n\nHe continued, going into more detail on cost and calling into question what he thought about Bloom\u2019s costs versus what the Department of Energy is targeting. The numbers he used were almost a decade old, but we thought the delta between Bloom\u2019s cost versus the DOE target was still worth noting:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little information on Bloom\u2019s costs that\u2019s been made public. There was one article published in 2010. Things have probably changed since then. There was a cost that Bloom had released.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a 100 kW Bloom energy system, it would cost $700,000 to $800,000. So the cost, if I just do the math. That is $7000 to $8000 per kilowatt. So it\u2019s about $7500 per kilowatt for a Bloom Energy system. That\u2019s in 2010. And DOE\u2019s target is closer to $900 per kW.\u201d\n\nPhD and Fuel Cell Technology Graduate Professor: Bloom\u2019s SOFCs Are \u201cPretty Old Technology\u201d\n\nWe also reached out to a PhD Professor of Engineering who teaches a graduate course in fuel cell technology and studied materials for solid oxide fuel cells for his graduate degree.\n\nWe asked him how fuel cells would rank among other green technology in the line for mainstream adoption. He told us:\n\n\u201cIn terms of overall green energy, probably what\u2019s best for the environment and sustainable are wind and solar\u2026\u201d\n\nHe also brought up SOFC\u2019s high temperatures as one of their key disadvantages:\n\n\u201cThe main disadvantage with the solid oxide fuel cell is the high operating temperature. They\u2019re operating at around 700-800 degrees Celsius.\u201d\n\nWhen we inquired as to how likely he thought it was that Bloom had something extremely unique with their patents, process or catalyst, he responded:\n\n\u201cTheir technology is pretty old technology. It\u2019s very well established.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed to the main hang-ups in the solid oxide fuel cell industry as costs and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe science is solid. There isn\u2019t anything thermodynamically that says that a fuel cell will not work. That technology exists. It\u2019s just now how you manufacture such that you can deliver it in a low-cost way. I think that\u2019s where the fuel cell industry is at. I think even Toyota still has to handmake some of their fuel cells. The components are not well suited for automation.\u201d\n\nFormer Bloom Employee: \u201cIf Congress Didn\u2019t Renew Their Subsidies, Bloom Energy Probably Wouldn\u2019t Exist Today\u201d\n\nWe also spoke to a former Bloom employee who worked for the company in the late 2000\u2019s and has more than 15 years\u2019 experience in servicing advanced energy products.\n\nHe first recalled being recruited saying:\n\n\u201cThe reason I turned it down was because of the product. Fuel cells have been around forever. No one\u2019s been able to crack the code to make it profitable. Here I am being recruited by a company that says otherwise.\u201d\n\nWhen we asked about whether Bloom had \u2018cracked the code\u2019 to get to profitability, the former employee focused on subsidies:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do that without subsidies and the materials that are in that thing are all rare earth materials which are pretty costly. There\u2019s only a few countries in the world \u2013 I think it\u2019s China and Russia \u2013 that own the rare earth materials that are being used in the thing. That\u2019s my knowledge from 11 years ago. Things could have changed, but it just seems like it\u2019s just so expensive to make and produce and then without the subsidies\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2026if congress didn\u2019t renew their subsidies, Bloom Energy probably wouldn\u2019t exist today. I just don\u2019t know how you make that. It\u2019s just playing off the green energy/climate change things that are going on out there that people want to feel good about this stuff and they\u2019re buying these Bloom Energy boxes\u2026\u201d\n\nHe also talked about the company\u2019s controversial project in Delaware:\n\n\u201c\u2026the company was thrown a lifeline. They weren\u2019t doing that well. You\u2019ve got the Obama administration \u2013 I think it was Joe Biden put the onus on the people in that state to subsidize Bloom Energy. Bloom Energy made a bunch of promises about employees that they never kept. But the people in Delaware are still paying. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nHe also commented about companies using Bloom products strictly for their PR image:\n\n\u201cI think with Bloom Energy \u2013 like, Google and Apple and some of these firms, are like \u2018yeah, I want to get on the bandwagon because I can make my stockholders happy because I\u2019m doing something with green energy\u2026\u2019 A lot of green energy stuff that was going out there maybe didn\u2019t work well, but these people were willing to take the risk and spend the money. Plus, they were getting subsidies so the pain wasn\u2019t that great, either. They all jumped in and took the risk.\u201d\n\nWe asked the same employee about the idea of companies using Bloom Boxes to claim that they\u2019re using clean and green energy. He responded quickly:\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re not really clean. They\u2019re still putting out a bunch of carbon dioxide. Everybody\u2019s complaining about CO2 and yet, that\u2019s a byproduct of this. And over time it gets worse because the efficiency of that fuel cell doesn\u2019t stay 100%.\u201d\n\nBloom Customers Weigh In\n\nWe also wanted to speak to people that had firsthand experience with Bloom Energy servers. After identifying project sites where Bloom servers have been installed through NYSERDA records, we spent weeks calling and speaking to more than 40 locations where servers have been installed.\n\nSome people that we spoke to at businesses like Home Depot and Walmart (store managers and assistant managers, mostly) told us that they didn\u2019t really know much about the Bloom Boxes on site. Most of the managers said they didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary unless something went wrong. Several referred us to their corporate numbers, as the Bloom installations were corporate-led initiatives.\n\nThe managers indicated that Bloom does all the servicing and didn\u2019t have prescheduled maintenance. They would see the service trucks come by from time to time but other than that generally had no knowledge of how regularly they were serviced or to what extent.\n\nSeveral of the managers that we spoke to, like one at the Home Depot in Enfield, said that the energy boxes have helped their P&L, or that energy costs weren\u2019t an issue. This was to be expected, due to Bloom guaranteeing service at dirt cheap \u2013 and we believe unsustainable \u2013 prices.\n\nThe issue of durability was brought up on a call that we had with a Home Depot manager in Greenbush, New York. As soon as we mentioned fuel cells to him, he launched into a story about how one had \u201cblown\u201d right after being installed and how another, at a second location in Clifton Park, \u201ccame off the building\u201d.\n\nThe Home Depot manager said:\n\n\u201cWe had it blow once already and we lost power for about a day and a half. There was a power surge and it blew. But other than that, it\u2019s been quiet. You\u2019d never notice it until something\u2019s wrong with it. We\u2019ve only had it for maybe a year now, going on maybe a year. A transformer blew on it.\u201d\n\nWe asked him to confirm whether the issue was with the Bloom boxes or the conventional grid. He responded:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just hard when something does go wrong, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s wrong with the power company or the fuel cell, so everybody\u2019s gotta figure out who\u2019s problem it is before they\u2019ll fix it. It took longer to figure out who was responsible to fix it than getting it repaired.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the fuel cell. It was them.\u201d\n\nWe were able to corroborate the claims by looking into the public NYSERDA data for Home Depot Greenbush, which shows an interruption in service in late January 2019. Efficiency numbers dropped across the board for a three-day period.\n\nFinally, he offered up a story about another Home Depot store in Clifton Park that had installation issues that were eventually resolved:\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t use the right bolts and everything came off the building. They had to re-do it. They didn\u2019t use the right bolts. They had it corrected by the time they got to our building. I guess there was an issue with the anchoring system.\u201d\n\nConclusion: We Are Witnessing Another Falling Unicorn\n\nAll told, we believe that Bloom Energy is facing numerous material and imminent problems.\n\nWith the company\u2019s accounting issues now exposed, we hope shareholders will demand far more detail going forward. We also hope the company\u2019s various partners will be more vigilant in understanding the company\u2019s carbon and hazardous waste footprint.\n\nBloom\u2019s story arc strikes us as reminiscent of other fallen Silicon Valley unicorns:\n\nLay out a grand vision to save the world Overpromise Draw accolades from everyone, raise billions of dollars \u2018Fake it \u2018til you make it\u2019 Never actually make it\n\nSimply put: the problems with Bloom\u2019s technology, accounting, undisclosed liabilities, debt burden, emissions & hazardous waste issues, in our opinion, put the prospect of bankruptcy or a reorganization on the table over the next 12-18 months.\n\nAppendix A: Methodology & Data Collection\u2014How to Replicate Our Work\n\nIdeally, we want the company to respond to our questions and offer the market a full explanation of its economic liabilities, CO2 output, accounting practices and other key issues. We welcome a response from the company, but in the event that they do not respond, we also want readers to be able to fully replicate and understand our work.\n\nThis thesis required a lot of unique data collection and number crunching, so we view it as important that we detail our methodology for both gathering and processing the data to help readers understand how we arrived at assumptions and conclusions. We encourage readers to download, examine, and question these datasets and our approach themselves.\n\nStarting with our estimate of Bloom\u2019s servicing liabilities:\n\nThe data and assumptions that went into it:\n\nCost to replace fuel cells: Bloom doesn\u2019t disclose how much fuel cells cost relative to total product, but EPA research shows that fuel cells represent roughly 29.3% of the total cost of a server. [Pg. 114]. New Jersey research into fuel cell projects (including Bloom\u2019s) show that the fuel cell servers cost roughly 2/3 more than the fuel cell itself. [Pg. 21] We used the EPA metric to estimate cost to replace fuel cell and applied this percentage to Bloom\u2019s product cost per kW in the latest quarter: $3,045/kW [Pg. 47]. We used ONLY product cost for this calculation (rather than total installed system cost) because fuel cells can be \u201chot swapped\u201d and therefore do not require incremental installation costs.\n\nBloom doesn\u2019t disclose how much fuel cells cost relative to total product, but EPA research shows that fuel cells represent roughly 29.3% of the total cost of a server.

Current replacement cycle: We are currently mid-way through the replacement cycle.

(In reality, we expect the company to replace many cells imminently, as shown by the current Generation 5 fuel cells nearing replacement thresholds, but we wanted to err on the side of conservative). Recovery value: We examined what the recovery value of fuel cell/server replacements could be. Department of Energy research has determined that recovery value for SOFC replacements \u201cwould not be significant\u201d [Pg. 105]\n\nWe examined what the recovery value of fuel cell/server replacements could be.

(This assumed that fuel cells are not replaced along with the servers. If the cells must also be replaced the cost would be significantly higher.) We used TISC for this estimation because servers would require new installation, whereas fuel cells can simply be \u201chot swapped\u201d and therefore would presume to only impact product costs rather than total installation costs.\n\n: 70.7% (or 1-29.3%) of the company\u2019s reported total installed system costs (TISC) per kW for the latest quarter; $5,274.

Service revenue: We extrapolated the latest quarterly service revenue run-rate across the 13-year average remaining life. [Pg. 48]\n\nRaw Data Sets on Output and Efficiency of Bloom\u2019s Projects\n\nMonthly performance data was obtained in two states, New York and California. These are the only states we could identify with robust and regularly-updated data on energy systems.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) publishes performance data on its website. See Monthly PBI Performance Report under Number 9 here.\n\nNew York has a similar program. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, known as NYSERDA publishes Distributed Energy Resources (DER) data on projects they fund. To see Bloom generators in field we searched \u201cbloom energy\u201d in the installer/developer section here.\n\nTo get a sense for how Bloom\u2019s newest version of generators performed, the analysis focuses on generators that were installed post 2016. We did this because Bloom stated that it expects 5-year performance from its fuel cell lives from 2017 onward and we wanted to test this specific claim:\n\n\u201cTime to stack replacement primarily driven by our fuel cell stack lives in the early years, replacement was typically 12 to 18 months. Over the years we have made steady improvements in our fuel cell lives, and from 2017 onwards we expect to average over five years between replacements.\u201d [IPO Prospectus Pg. 61]\n\nTo isolate generators installed after 2016, the \u201cinterconnection date\u201d in SGIP data and the first month of generation in the NY data was used in the data set.\n\nThere were some instances where generators exhibited strange performance in the data (such as generators operating at below 40% efficiency or seeming to break). With the efficiency, output and emissions samples we attempted to scrub out data points that appeared to be mostly negative outliers in order to give Bloom the benefit of the doubt (such as generators beginning to operate significantly below or above standard LHV efficiency between 40% to 70%, then sharply reverting). Had we included these potential outliers, Bloom\u2019s performance would have likely been significantly worse.\n\nHigher Heating Value to Lower Heating Value Efficiency Conversion\n\nA multiple of 1.107 (see page F-1) was used to convert the higher heating value efficiency provided by NYSDER to the lower heating value efficiency Bloom uses on its guarantees. This is the conversion factor found in Bloom\u2019s contracts with customers.\n\nEmissions: Pounds of CO2 per MwH\n\nTo calculate pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour emissions the following formula was used\n\n(3.412 MMBtu / 1 MWH) / HHV Efficiency * (117 pounds of CO2 / 1 MMBtu) = x bls carbon dioxide / MWH\n\n1 MWH is equivalent to 3.412 MMBTU. This is the conversion factor Bloom uses in its contracts (page F-1)\n\n1 MMBtu unit = 117 lbs of CO2 see Natural Gas row from the Energy Information Administration here\n\nHeat rate = (ideal heat rate)/efficiency = (3412 Btu/kWh)/efficiency\n\nFuel Cell Replacement Threshold\n\nBloom appears to be replacing fuel cells between 50% and 48% LVH efficiency. Fuel cells degrade linearly over time, yet between these efficiency ranges across Bloom\u2019s project base we regularly see sustained spikes in efficiency. The reason inferred for this is because fuel cells are being replaced in order to hit efficiency targets.\n\nThe largest source of historical data obtained on Bloom generator\u2019s past operating performance is from the state of California\u2019s SGIP program. Of the over 10,000 performance months dating back to 2012 in the SGIP data (each representing a historical month of operating performance from a Bloom generator dating back to 2012) less than 1% (89 instances) were operating below 48% LHV efficiency. (Of those, some were showing 0% efficiency, suggesting a system shutdown or other issue.) Less than 3% (256 instances) operated below 50% LHV efficiency. The data suggests that fuel cells are almost always being replaced before hitting the 48% LHV efficiency threshold.\n\nAppendix B\u2014Breakdown of Federal, State, and Local Subsidies to Bloom Energy\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of Bloom Energy\u2019s subsidy receipts to date:\n\nFederal Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC): This program is often associated with solar and renewable energy. Bloom has received an estimated $360 million from the program, but these subsidies are stepping down starting in 2020. We estimate that this step-down will result in $247 million in foregone subsidies to Bloom over the next 3 years at current annual run-rates.\n\nWe estimated the $360 million number by applying the 30% ITC to roughly $1.2 billion in product & installation revenue since 2014. We based our estimate of the foregone subsidies over the 3-year step-down period by using the 2018 annual run rate applied to the modified ITC percentage subsidies from the link above.\n\nCalifornia Self-Generation Incentive Program: Bloom received $376 million from this program as of 7/29/2019. In 2016, California modified the program after releasing a report indicating that Bloom Boxes were too expensive and released too much carbon to warrant incentives.\n\nThe modified incentive system requires replacing natural gas with biogas. With 91% of Bloom\u2019s servers operating on natural gas, the change rendered the program largely out of reach for the company. It is set to expire January 1, 2021 regardless.\n\nFederal Recovery Act: Bloom received $152 million for two projects [1,2] This program was established following the financial crisis to promote clean energy products, which mainly consisted of renewables but also included fuel cells. The subsidies received on Bloom\u2019s 2 projects were almost 10x the next largest fuel cell project.\n\nDelaware: Bloom has received $221 million between grants and subsidies from Delaware electricity ratepayers. [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n\nNew Jersey: Bloom and other fuel cell providers were ejected from the New Jersey Clean Energy Program (NJCEP) in 2016 over concerns relating to excess costs and carbon emissions [Pg. 16] Prior to that point Bloom had received $18.6 million from the program, per a FOIA request.\n\nConnecticut: We submitted a FOIL request to Connecticut but have not heard back as of this writing. We can confirm however that at least $35.4 million in subsidies have gone to Bloom from Connecticut from media articles.\n\nNew York: The state has been mum about subsidies paid to Bloom to date. We submitted a FOIL request but received no records back. We know that the state has awarded Bloom subsidies at least twice (1,2) but given the absence of specific data we did not factor any New York subsidies into our estimates.\n\nMassachusetts: Bloom tried and failed to \u201cmake non-combustible fuel cell technology eligible\u201d under a 2010 renewable energy program, according to media articles.\n\nAppendix C: Questions We Asked Bloom\n\nWe emailed Bloom and asked a number of questions. We have not heard back as of this writing but will update this report with their responses should we receive a reply. We figured it best to share these with readers to give a sense of the questions we would like the answers to:\n\nYou have stated that your expectation for fuel cell life from 2017 and onward is over 5 years. What is the actual performance of the fuel cells thus far and how does that compare with expected life?\n\nDo you have any internal estimates of what the service liabilities would be over the life of the customer\u2019s contracts? If so, could you make that available along with expectations of service revenue over the life of the customer\u2019s contracts?\n\nCan you confirm whether the financials only account for the next year of expected servicing revenue/liabilities?\n\nDo you see any other potential renewable applications of the product? The company announced hydrogen as a fuel source and alluded to other potential avenues recently.\n\nWhat performance do you expect out of the gen 7 servers in development? What about expected lifecycle, or is it too early to say?\n\nHow important is the price and supply of scandium to Bloom\u2019s supply chain? Can you give a sense of how scandium prices over time have affected the TISC?\n\nHow much does it cost to replace a fuel cell stack?\n\nHow much does it cost to replace an entire fuel cell server?\n\nAt what efficiency levels do you typically start replacing fuel cells?\n\nWhat are the criteria that determine whether to replace a server?\n\nWhat was the resolution of the EPA fine? The prospectus mentioned a $1 million fine that was being contested in relation to improper disposal of waste.\n\nAre there any other regulatory investigations or pending proceedings that you are aware of relating to the company?\n\nWith 2020 revenue expected to be flat, where does the company see the next stage of growth coming?\n\nDisclosure & Legal Disclaimer\n\nDisclosure: We are short shares of Bloom Energy\n\nAdditional disclaimer: Use of Hindenburg Research\u2019s research is at your own risk.
