Esper said the troops would not leave Syria completely.\n\n\n\nTrump defended the withdrawal, saying \"endless wars must end.\" It was \"very smart\" not to be involved in the fighting along the Turkish border, he added, and if other powers want to intervene in the conflict, \"Let them!\"\n\n\n\n\"Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?\"\n\nThe president said he was working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to possibly impose sanctions on Turkey for its invasion. Trump signed an executive order Friday giving his administration broad authority to sanction Turkey.\n\n\n\n\"We'll be taking in new information and we're ready to go at a moment's notice to put on sanctions,\" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said. \"Now we have warned the Turks...They know what we will do if they don't stop these activities.\"\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Esper told Fox News that he was aware of reports of ISIS prisoners escaping due to the Turkish invasion, as well as atrocities reportedly being committed against Syrian Kurds by members of a Turkish-supported Syrian Arab militia.\n\nEsper said that Turkey was ready to invade the country to attack Kurdish forces regardless of U.S. actions, and there was \"no way\" U.S. forces could have stopped the them.\n\nJames Mattis, Trump's first defense secretary, warned that a premature withdrawal would lead to a resurgence of ISIS after years of U.S. and Kurdish efforts to destroy the group. Mattis resigned as defense secretary last year over disagreements with Trump's foreign policy, including the president's desire to pull troops out of Syria.\n\n\"We may want a war over; we may even declare it over. You can pull your troops out as President Obama learned the hard way out of Iraq, but the 'enemy gets the vote,' we say in the military. And in this case, if we don't keep the pressure on, then ISIS will resurge. It's absolutely a given that they will come back,\" Mattis said in an interview with NBC's \"Meet The Press.\"\n\n\n\nTrump's decision has also sparked widespread opposition from his own party, including close allies such as Sen. Lindsey Graham. The senator from South Carolina has called on the president to change course.\n\nEsper said he spoke to Trump on Saturday night amid growing signs that the Turkish invasion was becoming more dangerous.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we learned that they likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned \u2014 and to the west,\" Esper said.\n\nU.S. allies and aid organizations have pushed for an end to the Turkish invasion, which has surfaced fears of a new humanitarian crisis in the region and a resurgent ISIS threat. France and Germany suspended arms sales to Turkey on Saturday in response to the invasion.\n\nOver 130,000 people have been displaced from rural areas around the northeast Syrian border towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain due to the conflict, according to the United Nations.", "description": "Turkey's invasion of northeastern Syria began Wednesday after Trump ordered U.S. troops to pull back from the area.", "authors": ["Emma Newburger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105390342-1533917203163trump.jpg?v=1533917277", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
