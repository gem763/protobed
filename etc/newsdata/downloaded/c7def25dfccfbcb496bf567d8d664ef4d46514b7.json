REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Illustration/File Photo\n\nIn a letter bit.ly/2BEFX3r to Joseph Macguire, acting director of national intelligence, the senators raised concerns about the video-sharing platform's collection of user data and whether China censors content seen by U.S. users. The letter also suggested TikTok could be targeted by foreign influence campaigns.\n\nConcern is growing in the United States about security and censorship issues involving TikTok, owned by Beijing-based tech company ByteDance, and other China-owned content platforms. Senator Marco Rubio has asked U.S. authorities to review allegations that the Chinese government uses TikTok for political censorship.\n\n\u201cWith over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone, TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore,\u201d wrote Schumer, the Senate\u2019s senior Democrat, and Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas.\n\nThey urged investigators to look into the issue of TikTok\u2019s collection of users\u2019 location-related data and other sensitive personal information.\n\nTikTok has said U.S. user data is stored in the United States, but the senators noted that ByteDance is governed by Chinese laws.\n\nThis month, Rubio asked a U.S. national security panel to review ByteDance\u2019s acquisition of Musical.ly Inc. He cited questions about why TikTok had \u201conly had a few videos of the Hong Kong protests that have been dominating international headlines for months.\u201d\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose product competes with TikTok particularly for younger users, also attacked the app over censorship concerns.\n\nTikTok has said China would not have jurisdiction over the app\u2019s content because the app does not operate in China.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content,\u201d a TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters. \u201cTo be clear: We do not remove videos based on the presence of Hong Kong protest content.\u201d\n\nThe spokeswoman said TikTok did not have other details on the senators\u2019 request.\n\n\u201cTikTok is committed to being a trusted and responsible corporate citizen in the U.S., which includes working with Congress and all relevant regulatory agencies,\u201d she said.\n\nConcerns about possible foreign influence on U.S. elections through social media platforms have grown since U.S. intelligence agencies found Russia conducted a cyber-influence campaign to help elect President Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Moscow has denied the claim.\n\nFacebook this week revealed it had suspended a network of Instagram accounts operated from Russia that targeted U.S. voters with divisive political messages ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.", "description": "U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Tom Cotton on Wednesday asked intelligence officials to investigate whether the popular Chinese-owned app TikTok poses national security risks.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444660047&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1VK", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
