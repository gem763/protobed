No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck. https://t.co/rJBeXUiwYS \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) October 8, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVideo game boycotts don\u2019t have a good history of being stuck to but, although it\u2019s back now, yesterday the Blizzard subreddit was shut down in protest and the Hearthstone community has become dominated by fans insisting they will never play a Blizzard game again.\n\nThat anger also been evident on Twitter, with even U.S. politicians and ex-Blizzard developers joining in, with many showing evidence of themselves cancelling subscriptions and pre-orders.\n\nNot everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened. Both the \"Think Globally\" and \"Every Voice Matters\" values have been covered up by incensed employees this morning. pic.twitter.com/I7nAYUes6Q \u2014 Kevin Hovdestad (@lackofrealism) October 8, 2019\n\nHearthstone players in the U.S. held up a banner saying, \u2018Free Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz\u2019 during their own esports tournament, while a statue at Blizzard\u2019s Californian campus that displays mottos including \u2018think globally\u2019 and \u2018every voice matters\u2019 have been covered up by disgruntled employees.\n\nBy far the most ingenious response though has been fans purposefully using Mei from Overwatch, who is Chinese, as a protest symbol for the pro-democracy campaign.\n\nTheir hope is that she\u2019ll become popular enough with the wider movement that Chinese authorities will take note and ban or censor Overwatch, which is made by Blizzard.\n\nLet's get back at Blizzard by making Mei a pro-democracy symbol!
