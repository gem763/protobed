It had been due to go into effect next month.\n\nIn a court hearing in Los Angeles on Friday, Gee asked the justice department attorney August Flentje how he could argue that the new regulations were not inconsistent with the terms of the Flores agreement.\n\n\u201cJust because you tell me it is night outside, doesn\u2019t mean it is not day,\u201d Gee said.\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration are expected to appeal.", "description": "Federal judge said administration rule was inconsistent with standards for humane treatment of migrant children in US custody", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/135c974edb4551daa194a6a73292c627eb8ab2de/0_4_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd14581f0d70e2dbe2f4d59dfde15f4f", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
