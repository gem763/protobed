During the raid, agents also seized a sawed-off shotgun and a package of methamphetamine.\n\nEagle Pass South Station Border Patrol agents assigned to the Highway 57 immigration checkpoint on October 17 observed a 2005 Chevrolet Colorado approaching for inspection. During an immigration interview, agents discovered the U.S. citizen driver from Katy, Texas, had three illegal immigrants in his truck. The agents arrested the driver and the illegally present trio, according to Del Rio Sector officials.\n\nDuring the processing of the migrants and the driver, the agents learned about a possible stash house in Eagle Pass. Agents coordinated with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents and executed a raid on the residence, officials stated.\n\nDuring the raid, agents found 12 people inside the house. Those include three suspected smugglers \u2014 all residents of Eagle Pass. A search also uncovered a sawed-off shotgun and 250 grams of methamphetamine, officials reported.\n\nThe 12 smuggled migrants came from El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Mexico.\n\nThe alleged human smugglers will face federal prosecution under 8 USC \u00a7 1324 \u2013 alien smuggling. If convicted on the charges, each could face up to 20 years in federal prison, officials stated.\n\n\u201cHuman smuggling is highly profitable for criminal organizations,\u201d Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz said in a written statement. \u201cAgents, along with our law enforcement partners, work hard to combat this type of illegal activity and safeguard the lives of those who may suffer at the hands of smugglers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuman stash houses are commonly used by criminal organizations to stage smuggled people in often sub-human conditions,\u201d Del Rio Sector officials wrote. \u201cIndividuals must typically await transport to interior destinations of the United States and pay fees to smugglers. It is not uncommon to be held for weeks in small, cramped structures without adequate ventilation, running water, or sanitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmugglers have also engaged in robbery, rape, and physical abuse,\u201d the officials stated.", "description": "Border Patrol agents rescued nine migrants from a stash house after stopping an attempt to move a separate group.", "authors": ["Bob Price"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/02/stash-house.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
