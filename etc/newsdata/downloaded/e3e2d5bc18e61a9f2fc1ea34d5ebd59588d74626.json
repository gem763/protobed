The transcript shows that the rot of bias at the Times is far beyond the pale and there is no hope of recovery. Yet not a single person there declared the obvious \u2014 that the paper is \u00adbetraying its principles.\n\nRigor in reporting and restraint in judgment once made the Gray Lady noble. Now she is dead, her homicide an inside job.\n\nThe transcript, leaked to Slate, reveals a confederacy of ignorance and bigotry involving hundreds of people. The ringleader is executive editor Dean Baquet, who fires the fatal shot into the credibility of his paper.\n\nBy giving reporters and editors license to try to stop Donald Trump from becoming president, then letting them peddle the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, Baquet helped unleash the \u00adhatred that is tearing America apart. Never before has a single media institution played such a destructive role in the nation\u2019s life.\n\nBut Baquet is not finished. The 75-minute meeting shows he is now determined to \u00addestroy the president by painting him as a racist.\n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019ve got to change,\u201d Baquet tells his assembled staff after acknowledging that the paper was \u201ca little tiny bit flat-footed\u201d when special counsel Robert Mueller performed so poorly before Congress.\n\nIn other words, Baquet had swallowed hook, line and sinker Hillary Clinton\u2019s fiction that Trump conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the election.\n\nThen again, this is the same editor whose paper was certain Clinton would win in 2016. Quite a track record.\n\nWhich leads to Baquet\u2019s newest idea for stopping Trump.\n\n\u201cHow do we cover a guy who makes these kinds of remarks? How do we cover the world\u2019s reaction to him? How do we cover America, that\u2019s become so divided by Donald Trump? How do we write about race in a thoughtful way, something we haven\u2019t done in a large way in a long time? That, to me, is the \u00advision for coverage . . . for the rest of the next two years.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t journalism. It\u2019s political activism aligned with the talking points of Democrats. And to liken race relations today to those in the 1960s, as \u00adBaquet does, is beyond ignorant.\n\nThe Aug. 12 meeting was held after an uproar over a headline deemed too friendly to Trump. \u201cTrump Urges Unity vs Racism\u201d didn\u2019t convey a sufficient dose of Trump hatred, so Baquet had it rewritten to criticize the president\u2019s sober remarks after the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton.\n\nEven that wasn\u2019t enough to sate the monster he created, so Baquet assembled the newsroom to hear the grievances and explain his thinking.\n\nThough none of those asking questions are identified, they are indistinguishable in wanting the paper to regularly call Trump a racist and a liar. These are supposedly straight news reporters and editors, yet are unrestrained in demanding that their partisan opinions dictate coverage.\n\nOne staffer asks Baquet, \u201cCould you explain your decision not to more regularly use the word racist in reference to the president\u2019s actions?\u201d\n\nAnother wonders, \u201cYou mentioned that there could be situations when we would use the word racist. What is that standard?\u201d\n\nA third sees \u201cracism and white supremacy being sort of the foundation of this country\u201d and wants those topics front and center. \u201cI just feel like racism is in everything. It should be considered in our science reporting, in our culture reporting, in our national reporting.\u201d\n\nAnother asks, \u201cWhat is the overall strategy here for getting us through this administration?\u201d\n\nSometimes Baquet gently disagrees \u2014 up to a point. He says the best way to make the case is by showing instead of telling and cites examples from the 1960s, as if they are relevant.\n\nNot once does he express any doubt that Trump is guilty as charged, or say that reporters should not be expressing partisan opinions. He\u2019s only quibbling over how to present the agreed-upon conclusions.\n\nIndeed, there is zero evidence in the transcript that anyone in the room objects. Even allowing that some might have doubts about an entire news organization speaking with one scripted voice, the silence shows nobody felt secure enough to say so. No safe spaces for dissenters there.\n\nThe failure of anyone to recognize that the approach violates the paper\u2019s historic standards of fairness and the strict separation of news from opinion speaks volumes about how low the Times has sunk.\n\nIf there is a silver lining, it is that the public has been warned. Readers who want straight facts and fair play won\u2019t find it in the Times. All they will get is a biased agenda and a guaranteed conclusion.\n\nLife, liberty and Justice Thomas\n\nThere is no shortage of smart books about the rise of the administrative state. But it\u2019s hard to imagine a more creative approach than juxtaposing this disturbing development against the life and judicial opinions of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nIn \u201cClarence Thomas and the Lost Constitution,\u201d author Myron Magnet weaves together two distinct worlds. One is Thomas\u2019 coming of age in segregated Georgia and the hard-knock lessons he learned from his grandfather.\n\nsee also Ruth Bader Ginsburg treated for malignant tumor on pancreas Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has undergone radiation treatment for a...\n\nWe also see Thomas\u2019 brief descent into youthful rage and his evolving embrace of the patriotic liberty enshrined in America\u2019s founding documents.\n\nThe other world is the vast expansion of the liberty-crushing federal agencies that effectively make laws without the bother of legislation and enforce them without the bother of federal courts. The progressive visions of Presidents Woodrow Wilson and FDR claim center stage, aided by a Congress that even now cedes too much power to unaccountable bureaucrats.\n\nThese two worlds collide when Thomas joins the court. In an efficient 168 hardcover pages, Magnet, a friend, demonstrates how Thomas, through his opinions, speeches and writings, wages war against this unholy power grab with the aim of restoring the Founders\u2019 idea of limited government.\n\nMy first impression was that the book was too ambitious, but Magnet is in complete command of his material and has produced a very readable gem.\n\nThe feat is all the more remarkable because he did not interview Thomas. Instead, Magnet uses available biographical material to show how Thomas arrived at his understanding of the Constitution, one shaped by the unique abuses inflicted on African Americans by excessive government power.\n\nWith Thomas now one of five conservative justices on the court, there is a chance to limit the bureaucrats\u2019 reach. Whatever the outcome, this book is a brilliant road map.\n\nTwo more years?! Lamenting the Putz\n\nReader Charlie Morris calls Mayor Bill de Blasio the WME (worst mayor ever) and adds: \u201cWe will have a very challenging time over the next 2-plus years with a mayor who dislikes his job and the people who put him in office. Too bad we can\u2019t impeach the Putz!\u201d", "description": "Rigor in reporting and restraint in judgment once made the Gray Lady noble. Now she is dead, her homicide an inside job.
