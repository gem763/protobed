Critics say deforestation, caused by the government\u2019s policy of increasing farming, is to blame for the disaster.\n\nThe government says it has spent more than $20 million in its effort to douse the flames. Complaints over the government\u2019s handling of the crisis have dented the popularity of Bolivia\u2019s leftist president, Evo Morales.\n\nIn neighbouring Brazil, the number of fires in the Amazon rainforest receded in September amid improved weather conditions and containment efforts by the country\u2019s military.", "description": "Heavy rains have helped military contain blazes that have burnt more than 4m hectares of land", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e52d463f65ffd6e029064f12fd36fc193c2d419/0_168_3660_2195/master/3660.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=491b56cdbaa60429509be7041dee05c7", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
