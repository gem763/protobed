REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nThe United Nations predicts that Nigeria\u2019s population will more than double to 400 million by 2050, which would make it the third most populous country in the world after China and India.\n\nThe combination of population growth and congestion has made Nigeria, and more broadly West Africa, attractive to foreign transport companies.\n\nUber\u2019s chief business officer told Reuters in June the company planned to launch the service to carry travellers in the Lagos megacity of around 20 million people that is built on a lagoon.\n\nThe waterway service, UberBOAT, is operated in partnership with local boat operator Texas Connection Ferries and the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA), said the ride-hailing firm.\n\n\u201cThis initiative is aimed at providing commuters with an easy and affordable way to get in and out of the city\u2019s business districts,\u201d Uber said in a statement.\n\nThe pilot phase will operate on weekdays from 0700 GMT to 1600 GMT on a fixed route between two locations in the city.\n\nPassengers will be charged a flat fare of 500 naira ($1.39) per trip, compared with about 300 naira by minibus for a similar journey in the commercial hub of the West African country where most people live on less than $2 a day.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday, Uber officials said there would be four trips a day, carrying up to 35 people on a boat, during the two-week pilot.\n\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, the governor of Lagos state, said the Uber boat service, and the use of waterways in general, were part of a raft of initiatives aimed at easing congestion that include a programme of road repairs.\n\n\u201cWe want ferries that carry 60 to 80 people,\u201d he said, referring to his hopes for the future use of waterways, on Thursday at a forum with businesses.\n\nUber\u2019s boat initiative follows a number of motorcycle ride-hailing firms that have targeted West Africa as an area for expansion in the last few months.\n\nTechnology giant Google also launched a new feature in July that allows Nigerians to hear travel advice in a local voice on Google Maps. Another feature allows users in Lagos to seek directions from \u201cinformal transit\u201d services, such as private minibuses.", "description": "Global ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc on Friday launched a pilot test of a boat service in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos to attract commuters seeking to avoid the megacity's notoriously congested roads.", "authors": ["Alexis Akwagyiram", "Nneka Chile", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439659727&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0ZJ-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
