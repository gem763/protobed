Dominic Lorrimer\n\nDevelopment site sales volumes fell 21 per cent in Victoria to $1.9 billion, and fell in all the other mainland states apart from the very small South Australian market, which bucked the national trend with a four-fold rise to $78 million.\n\nDriving the 38 per cent national fall was reduced demand from overseas investors, especially in Sydney, where they accounted for just 11 per cent of total site sales. Across Sydney, average site values fell 12 per cent to $184,000 per apartment, more than double the fall in Melbourne.\n\nThe 12-month period covered by the report included the evacuations of the faulty Opal and Mascot Towers in Sydney, a growing national flammable cladding crisis and lack of appetite among the major banks to lend to developers.", "description": "Sales of development sites suitable for high-density projects in Sydney halved to $1.97 billion, a report by Knight Frank found.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_275/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4528b6ed2cc76039bf3e23123175459038ab3dfd", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
