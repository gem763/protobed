In 2011, the United States, Brazil and many other countries around the world entered into a large-scale project to restore 150 million hectares of forest by the year 2020 and 350 million hectares by the year 2030 called the Bonn Challenge.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal was to renew large swaths of \u201cdeforested and degraded\u201d land, and a total of 56 countries have joined the cause since it was created. It was estimated that 350 million hectares of forest could soak up 1.7 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide every year.\n\nWe are on track to meet the goals set by the Bonn Challenge, but many climate experts have noted that much of the progress that\u2019s been made won\u2019t necessarily produce the intended climate benefits. A report from earlier this year that was published in the journal Nature found nearly half of the land that was pledged for forest area was \u201cset to become plantations of commercial trees.\u201d That means smaller, fast-growing trees that are grown to be harvested for paper, pulp and log make up much of what\u2019s being counted as new forest area.\n\n\u201cIf trees are harvested, it doesn\u2019t take carbon out of the atmosphere for long before it\u2019s put right back,\u201d Richard Houghton, an expert in forest science at the Wood Hole Research Center, tells The Daily Beast.\n\nDavid Milarch is a co-founder of the Archangel Ancient Tree Archive. This organization clones the largest and oldest trees from many different tree species around the world. They\u2019ve cloned trees from over 130 different countries since the organization was founded 25 years ago, including the coast redwood, and they aim to \u201cpropagate the world\u2019s most important old-growth trees before they are gone.\u201d\n\nMilarch tells The Daily Beast that if you want to get serious about tackling climate change, you need to be planting large trees that will be around for hundreds of years or more. He says planting smaller trees that will be harvested in the near future is \u201cnot doing anything for sequestering carbon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou plant the right tree in the right place. You plant the strongest, hardiest natives state-by-state and region-by-region,\u201d Milarch says. \u201cYou have to go about this very intelligently.\u201d\n\nGordon Bonan, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, tells The Daily Beast that reforestation and planting new trees are \u201cessential components of climate change mitigation.\u201d He says forests act as a \u201ccarbon sink to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThat said, some worry focusing too much on planting trees and restoring forests to fight climate change could be harmful. A study that was published in the journal Science in July claimed planting a trillion new trees would have a tremendous impact in the fight against climate change and could theoretically be accomplished. Many articles were written about what looked to be exciting news, but even the study\u2019s lead author said this would not likely happen and shouldn\u2019t be seen as a silver bullet in the fight against climate change.\n\n\u201cReforestation is one possible way to address climate change, but the main thing we have to be doing is reducing greenhouse gases,\u201d Karen Holl, a professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, tells The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s not a substitute.\u201d\n\nHoll says people shouldn\u2019t get the idea that we can \u201cplant our way out of climate change.\u201d She says restoring forests and planting new trees are important parts of the equation, but reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is the top priority. Furthermore, she says we need to put a stop to the large amount of deforestation that\u2019s taking place in the United States, Brazil and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is to be protecting existing forests, because they hold a huge amount of carbon both above ground and in the soil,\u201d Holl says.\n\nThe planet lost over half a million square miles of forest between 1990 and 2016. President Trump issued an executive order at the beginning of this year that allows for more logging on public lands, and President Bolsanaro of Brazil has begun a logging campaign that will likely decimate the Amazon rainforest. New data shows the Amazon is losing roughly three football fields of forest per minute to deforestation.\n\nHoughton says that reforestation and planting new trees are things that the U.S. should be doing much more actively, and he thinks we could stop subsidizing fossil fuels and use that money to pay for a large forest restoration project. It\u2019s extremely unlikely this will happen during the Trump administration, but the experts we spoke with said it could be accomplished after 2020 if Democrats controlled the White House, both houses of Congress, and made it a priority.\n\n\u201cGetting off fossil fuels and getting into renewable energy will take some years, so in the interim, we could use some new forest,\u201d Houghton said.", "description": "Scientists caution that we probably can\u2019t \u201cplant our way out\u201d of the climate crisis, but growing big trees and keeping them around is an important piece of the puzzle.", "authors": ["Thor Benson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565206463/190806-benson-redwood-climate-change-tease_jlccck", "published_at": "2019-08-08"}
