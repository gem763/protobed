A no deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU.\"\n\nYesterday, the Irish PM and Mr Johnson declared they could \"see a pathway\" to a possible agreement.", "description": "It comes after a positive meeting between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar yesterday so a shift in negotiations.", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16229045.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_European-Union-Chief-Brexit-Negotiator-Barnier-addresses-the-European-Parliament-Foreign-Affairs-Com.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
