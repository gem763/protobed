The latest example is with the headlines coming out after an Instagram post on Friday. She took a moment or two out of her weekend to praise the charity work of Duchess Meghan a.k.a. Duchess of Sussex. Also, a.k.a. Meghan Markle, an American actress, and social justice warrior.\n\nMeghan landed herself a royal catch \u2013 Prince Harry, son of Princess Diana and Prince Charles. Harry is the prince who will never be King of England. The new duchess has developed quite a trail of ugly press reports in England, exhibiting diva behavior and treating staff poorly. You can see why she would fit the profile of someone Hillary Clinton would gush over.\n\nThe 71-year-old presidential wannabe is spending the weekend in Italy at a conference hosted by an Italian think tank, The European House \u2013 Ambrosetti. For some reason, she is an invited speaker. The theme is \u201cIntelligence On The World, Europe and Italy\u201d according to the press release. Perhaps Hillary saw some reporting on Duchess Meghan coming to the end of her maternity leave and starting up her charity work again next week. Naturally, Hillary seized the opportunity to insert herself into the story. She is \u201cinspired\u201d by Markle\u2019s work with Smart Works, a charity that provides clothing and coaching for women seeking employment.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B2FCKF8pWC-/?utm_source=ig_embed\n\nMarkle has designed a fashion line of workwear to aid the charity and will make her public comeback with a visit to Smart Works to promote it.\n\nAll of Meghan\u2019s charity work appears to have touched the former US secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate. Hillary shared a photo of Meghan hugging another woman on Instagram on Friday and sang her praises in the accompanying post. She said: \u201cI\u2019m so inspired by how Meghan Markle\u2014aka one half of @sussexroyal\u2014is representing the U.S. in the U.K. and on the world stage.\u201d She added: \u201cMeghan\u2019s new project: Helping @SmartWorksCharity equip women who have been out of the workforce with the office essentials they need to feel confident in job interviews and beyond. The ability to earn their own paycheck is a key part of women\u2019s economic, social, and cultural equality, and it can all start with some smart suits.\u201d\n\nBless her heart. Hillary probably wouldn\u2019t have caused a stir as a participant in this Italian think tank\u2019s conference but she cleverly used social media to grab some headlines in Europe. How did she do that? Well, it may be because of the fact that Meghan and Harry hired Sara Latham as head of communications on their staff. Latham is a former senior adviser to Hillary\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. The Washington D.C. swamp crossed the pond. Latham is a dual citizen and has a work history in both countries.\n\nLatham worked with the Democratic nominee during her 2016 presidential campaign. She also served as chief of staff to John Podesta, the chairman of Clinton\u2019s campaign. She had an integral role in vetting candidates for Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, USA Today reported. She also worked for Bill Clinton in the White House in the late \u201990s. According to her LinkedIn, she was special assistant to the chief of staff and deputy assistant to the president and deputy director of scheduling from 1996 to 2000. USA Today called Latham a \u201clongtime Democratic fixer.\u201d In 1996, she was recruited to assist with Bill Clinton\u2019s re-election campaign, and 2008, she helped Podesta arrange secret interviews for President Obama\u2019s prospective cabinet members. The Telegraph reported that she was part of the POTUS\u2019s \u201ctransition team\u201d when he was first elected to office.\n\nApparently Latham has been hired to fix the press stories about Meghan. Good luck with that.\n\nHillary isn\u2019t the only American public figure in attendance at the conference. Also there and publicized as speakers are Senator Lindsey Graham and Cindy McCain, according to the press release. Cindy McCain is debating Marcus Kerber, German Vice Minister of the Interior, Building and Community. The subject is listed as Today\u2019s Social Challenges. I wasn\u2019t aware Mrs. McCain is a debater.\n\nGraham and Clinton are scheduled to deliver speeches under the heading of Country Focus USA. The conference boasts \u201cWe are honored to be hosting an official delegation of five members of the US Senate and House of Representatives\u201d which means American taxpayers probably paid for this Italian adventure. It\u2019s good to be a swamp-dweller.\n\nI\u2019d be willing to bet that Hillary takes the opportunity to slam President Trump over something or the other during her little speech. Think of how tickled her pal Meghan would be, given how she was such a big Hillary supporter in 2016. It would be more headlines for the woman who is still unable to accept the results of the 2016 presidential election.", "description": "Anything for a bit of publicity.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Hillary-Clinton.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
