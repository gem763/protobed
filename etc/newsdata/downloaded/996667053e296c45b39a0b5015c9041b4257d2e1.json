His Shostakovich Trilogy dances in tandem with a composer for whom Ratmansky feels deep affinity and it\u2019s a consummate achievement, packing in emotive biography, arch humour, audacious virtuosity, claustrophobic fear and stirring displays of power and unity. The moods shift as frequently as the attitudes of the Soviet censors who dogged Shostakovich\u2019s career. A fitting tribute to a great composer.

Set in swinging 60s London, Play Without Words is based loosely on Joseph Losey\u2019s 1963 film The Servant, and it\u2019s a tightly choreographed, seductive piece of dance-theatre, playing with power dynamics and choreographic structure to slick, sizzling effect. LW Read the review\n\n18\n\nTooMortal (2012)\n\nMade for historic churches, Shobana Jeyasingh\u2019s TooMortal places the audience at the altar, six female dancers half hidden in the pews, and fills the nave with dissonant chimes, tenebrous voices and murky light. The action is spare, but its images loom large: pews as cradles or coffins, the aisle as abyss, elementally evoking the tribulations, desolations and consolations of life\u2019s journey. This is a small, seemingly simple work that holds big ideas. SR Read the review\n\n17\n\nRain (2001)\n\nThe minimalist composer Steve Reich has been a longtime muse for Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, and she immersed herself in his Music for 18 Musicians to make this shimmering dance. De Keersmaeker\u2019s choreography is meticulously precise but the result looks like joyful, carefree abandon, the dancers bounding and skipping in a winding, looping skein of movement. A hugely sophisticated work that bathes the audience in a dreamlike glow.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\n16\n\nV (2001)\n\nAs with all of Mark Morris\u2019s best work, V does more than take inspiration from its accompanying score; it allows you to see, feel and hear the genius of Schumann\u2019s Piano Quintet in E flat major with a piercing clarity. From its passages of brightly crafted invention \u2013 floated on music of rapt and tender lyricism \u2013 to the stark, even abject melancholy of its darker sections, this is pure dance at its most emotionally and physically distilled.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\n15\n\nBird Song (2004)\n\nA formative figure of British dance, Siobhan Davies has for many years eschewed the stage as a platform for creation; perhaps, after Bird Song, she could go no further in this direction. Meshing astonishingly fine detail within a sweeping compositional frame \u2013 a kind of choreographic vortex that spirals into, then out of, a hushed central solo \u2013 the work feels cosmic in reach and intimate in effect, like a galaxy with the song of a bird at its centre. SR Read the review\n\n14\n\nFormosa (2017)\n\nLin Hwai-min\u2019s final work for Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, the company he founded in 1973, shows both the sure hand of long experience and an imagination still fresh and full of wonder. A tribute to Lin\u2019s native Taiwan that deftly weaves choreography, scenography, voiceover and typography, its nine numinously poetic scenes are as distilled, elegant and dense with imagery as the Chinese script itself, whether Lin is contemplating an egret, a war, city life or the sea. SR Read the review\n\n13\n\nDesh (2011)\n\nLondon-born Akram Khan is one of the most captivating dancers of his generation, his childhood training in the Indian classical dance form kathak underpinning explorations in contemporary dance and performance. Following powerful pure dance works and experiments with text, Desh is the solo that most successfully synthesised Khan\u2019s mix of awe-inspiring physicality and funny, searching monologue, as Khan journeys into his Bangladeshi heritage with Tim Yip\u2019s designs creating a magical visual feast. LW Read the review\n\n12\n\nBosque Ardora (2014)\n\nFlamenco firecracker Roc\u00edo Molina makes actual sparks fly with her ferocious feet (and some clever props). A dancer capable of immense grace but also beautiful spikiness, awkward angles and compelling physical contrariness, Molina produces work that blazes with feminism, even when she doesn\u2019t overtly state it. Bosque Ardora casts her as a creature of the woods, both hunter and hunted in a capricious game with the men on stage. It\u2019s an audacious, inventive, blistering piece.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\n11\n\nFour Quartets (2018)\n\nAfter two decades in New York\u2019s underground scene, Pam Tanowitz seemingly conquered the dance world with a single work. In the first authorised dance version of TS Eliot\u2019s Four Quartets, Tanowitz\u2019s movement gets inside Eliot\u2019s musings on time in the strong internal rhythms of its richly textured choreography. As well as a real clarity of line and voice, it has beautiful craft and is always unpredictable, as fascinating threads of movement unspool, taking the viewer in unexpected directions. LW Read the review\n\n10\n\nParadise Lost (lies unopened beside me) (2015)\n\nAn inspired fantasia on Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost by the writer, performer and choreographer Ben Duke. In this witty but profound solo show, Duke uses a mix of text, movement and bewildered charm to tackle the labours and horrors of creation, playing wild and free with the source text. The genius comes in drawing parallels between God\u2019s task and Duke\u2019s own more commonplace, but no less mind blowing, act of creation: parenthood. Duke\u2019s follow-up, riffing on Romeo and Juliet, is just as accomplished. LW Read the review\n\n9\n\nEast Wall (2018)\n\nCommunity dance often has a celebratory or affirmative remit, but East Wall \u2013 a collaboration between choreographer Hofesh Shechter and East London Dance, staged in front of a postcard-perfect Tower of London \u2013 feels more like sticking your finger in a socket and being jolted by the vitality and violence of a place and its people. Krump vies with gospel and Bowie, a band of Beefeaters march over a civilian, clowns caper with executioners and hallowed heritage clashes with messy, multiracial histories. Scrappy it may be, but oh \u2013 the force, the life. SR Read the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Painful to watch \u2026 Umwelt. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\n8\n\nUmwelt (2004)\n\nUnderstandably, Maguy Marin\u2019s Umwelt always induces walkouts. Nine mirrored panels rotate slowly, for an hour. Nine performers emerge at each turn to execute an action \u2013 all deadpan, whether it\u2019s mopping the floor, pointing a gun or chucking out a baby doll. There\u2019s a pervasive noise, as blank as the wind. A rope winches across the stage, at paint-drying pace. The entire process remains indifferent to our thoughts, feelings, wishes or indeed presence. Painful to watch, yes, but there it is: an unblinking glimpse into the void at the core of our existence. SR Read the review\n\n7\n\nWoolf Works (2015)\n\nWayne McGregor\u2019s three-act work for the Royal Ballet makes characteristically brilliant mayhem with the conventions of narrative dance. Inspired by the life and writings of Virginia Woolf, it ranges in style and content from the inner emotional dramas of Mrs Dalloway to the time-bending fantasy of Orlando and the limpid reflections on mortality in The Waves. With a lavishly atmospheric score from Max Richter, mind-altering lighting by Lucy Carter, and a deeply affecting central performance from Alessandra Ferri, Woolf Works takes McGregor to a freer choreographic space than he\u2019d seemingly inhabited before.

Forty-one and nearing retirement, Doisneau stands centre stage and talks of her career, the parts she danced, and most poignantly the ones she didn\u2019t \u2013 she floats through a scene from Giselle, humming the music to herself, haunting the role. It\u2019s a bittersweet story of almost, but not quite, achieving one\u2019s dream.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\n5\n\nPush (2005)\n\nWhen it comes to hushed, hypnotic beauty, Russell Maliphant has created a few contenders for this list (notably 2009\u2019s AfterLight, his solo for Daniel Proietto). However, Push is not only an exceptional piece of dance, but a reinvention for legendary ballerina Sylvie Guillem, shifting her career from classical to contemporary. In shadows and spotlights, with Maliphant\u2019s Zen-like martial arts-inspired choreography, the pair build an equal partnership of tension, fluidity and deep trust; a masterclass in understated intensity. LW Read the review\n\n4\n\nMerce Cunningham at the Tate Modern (2003)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of another performance where dance, design and location coincided to such serendipitously beautiful effect. Framed by the cosmic sorcery of Olafur Eliasson\u2019s Weather Project, the dancers from Cunningham\u2019s company took possession of the vast Turbine Hall, sometimes moving so close to those of us watching that we felt the whiplash passing of their bodies, sometimes receding into the outer edges of hall, silhouetted against the giant glowing radiance of Eliasson\u2019s sun. Both intensely intimate and spectacularly awesome \u2013 it feels as though the universe were dancing around us. JM Read the review\n\n3\n\nSutra (2008)\n\nIn this funny, charismatic and profoundly humane collaboration between Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and the monks from Shaolin Temple, there is not a whiff of fake \u201cexoticism\u201d or cultural appropriation. Cherkaoui\u2019s choreography revels in the maniacal danger and beauty of the monks\u2019 kung fu heritage \u2013 shamelessly displaying their shadow-boxing, backflips and flying kicks \u2013 but it also explores the spiritual and social heart of the Shaolin\u2019s monastic world. A journey of joyous exchange for Cherkaoui as well for as his audience. JM Read the review\n\n2\n\nSwan Lake/Loch Na hEala (2016)\n\nRarely does dance address specific social issues with the imagination and sophistication of Michael Keegan-Dolan\u2019s Loch Na hEala, unpicking Swan Lake\u2019s simplistic view of good and evil via a story of sexual abuse in the Catholic church. There\u2019s always been a bristling undercurrent of scorn in the Irish choreographer\u2019s work, but the power of this piece is the marriage of blunt detail and disgust with moments of mythical transcendence, all swirled together like the mist on a lake. LW Read the review\n\n1\n\nBetroffenheit (2015)\n\nOne of the most thrilling dance stories of the new century has been the rise and rise of Crystal Pite. With a steadfast belief in her own choreographic principles, Pite has created true and startling works for both classical and contemporary companies. Her language has taken flight in epic compositions of abstract dance but, as in her harrowing masterpiece Betroffenheit, it has also plumbed depths of human experience. Created in collaboration with actor and writer Jonathon Young, this 2015 work explores the hellhole of grief into which Young was plunged by the accidental deaths of his daughter, nephew and niece. The pain, humiliation and sheer ugliness of that experience is given searing physical embodiment in Pite\u2019s choreography but so too is the slow process of recovery and redemption. As raw and unflinching as Betroffenheit is, however, you come away from it with a wild feeling of exhilaration \u2013 uplifted by its courage, its coruscating beauty and by the faith it affirms in the power of art to address emotions that lie beyond reason or words.
