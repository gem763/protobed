Among Hispanics, 44% favor reparations.\n\nLori Statzer, 79, of West Palm Beach, Florida, opposes cash reparations and an official government apology.\n\n\u201cNone of the black people in America today are under the slavery issue,\u201d said Statzer, who is white. \u201cIt\u2019s over with.\u201d\n\nUsing taxpayers\u2019 money to pay reparations \u201cwould be unfair to me,\u201d she added. \u201cMy ancestors came to this country, worked hard to become Americans and never asked for anything.\u201d\n\nPoll respondents also were sharply divided by race on whether the U.S. government should issue an apology for slavery: 64% of white Americans oppose a government apology, while 77% of black Americans and 64% of Hispanics believe an apology is due. Overall, 46% of Americans favor and 52% oppose a national apology.\n\nNot everyone realizes how horrible slavery was to black Americans, said 63-year-old Nathan Jordan, adding that the federal government should apologize for slavery \u201cbecause it was wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile he supports reparations, Jordan, who is black and lives in Vienna, Georgia, can\u2019t put a dollar figure on what would be fair.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the government could even afford that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the value would be. There are still a lot of (black) people trying to catch up. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ll ever catch up.\u201d\n\nAlicia Cheek, 56, of Asheboro, North Carolina, who is black, opposes both reparations and a government apology, saying white people today \u201ccan\u2019t be liable for what their ancestors did.\u201d She also questions how a fair amount could be determined.\n\nThe nation is marking 400 years since the first slave ship sailed to what would become the United States, bringing about 20 slaves to the British colony at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619.\n\nOver the next two centuries, more than 300,000 men, women and children were forcibly brought to what is now the U.S. from Africa, according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database.\n\nThe debate on reparations has flared on and off since the moment slavery in the U.S. officially ended in 1865.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Union Army Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman promised compensation to freed slaves in the form of land and mules to farm it - hence the phrase \u201c40 acres and a mule.\u201d But President Andrew Johnson took away the offer.\n\nMore than 120 years later, then-Rep. John Conyers, a Detroit Democrat, introduced legislation to establish a commission to develop reparations proposals. He reintroduced it in every congressional session until he resigned in 2017, and it was reintroduced last year by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat. Presidential candidate and Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey filed a Senate companion bill this year.\n\nOther Democratic candidates have come out in support of reparations or at least a commission to study it.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has publicly opposed the idea of a national reparations policy.\n\nAnita Belle, founder of the Reparations Labor Union in Detroit, says \u201cdoing the right thing means making amends for what a nation did wrong.\u201d\n\nBelle said she was encouraged to see even a low level of support for reparations among white Americans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still progress,\u201d she said.\n\nAn apology for slavery would help the country move on, said Reuben Miller, assistant professor in the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration.\n\n\u201cAnd by moving on, I don\u2019t mean moving on and forgetting,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean moving on past the atrocity. It would teach a lesson about the relationship of black Americans with their government.\u201d\n\nThe new poll finds that about 3 in 10 Americans think the history of slavery still has a great deal of influence on black Americans. About another 3 in 10 think it has a fair amount of influence.\n\nAnd many see enduring disadvantages for black Americans in public life. About two-thirds of Americans think white people are treated more fairly than black people by police, and about half see advantages for white people in applying for jobs or shopping in stores.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at righting the wrong with cash to the people that were done wrong,\u201d Belle said. \u201cTo just say we aren\u2019t going to do anything is to just perpetuate the wrong.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video producer Noreen Nasir reported from Chicago.\n\n___\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,286 adults was conducted Sept. 20-23 using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nAP-NORC Center: http://www.apnorc.org/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Few Americans are in favor of giving reparations to descendants of enslaved black people in the United States, a new poll shows, even as the idea has gained momentum among Democratic presidential contenders.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Corey Williams", "Noreen Nasir"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/25/ap_poll_reparations_92815_c0-0-4032-2352_s1200x700.jpg?8f933bd9b70838c61c890c09c299727f73238683", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
