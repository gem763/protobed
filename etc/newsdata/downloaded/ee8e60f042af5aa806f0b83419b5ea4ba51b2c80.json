(The United States first deployed troops there in 2015.)\n\nAD\n\nWe analyzed and contextualized a number of his statements below.\n\n\u2018The United States and nobody else'\n\nTrump described Turkey\u2019s cease-fire in northeastern Syria as \u201cpermanent\u201d and said sanctions would be lifted, describing the outcome as being due to the \u201cthe United States and nobody else, no other nation.\u201d\n\nBut just one day earlier, Russian and Turkish leaders met in Sochi, a Russian resort town on the Black Sea, and agreed on a plan that would see them take over the territory U.S.-backed Kurdish forces controlled until this month \u2014 a sign of how little input the United States really has on the situation.\n\nAD\n\nAnd despite calling the cease-fire \u201cpermanent,\u201d Trump seemed to cast some doubt on his own claim, adding that it\u2019s \u201cquestionable\u201d to call anything in the region permanent.\n\nSafe zone\n\nTurkey is hosting millions of Syrian refugees, and as Erdogan faces mounting economic pressure at home, he\u2019s suggested returning Syrians back to their home country by establishing a safe zone along the Syrian side of the Turkish-Syrian border. Human rights advocates have expressed a wide range of concerns over this plan. They worry that refugees will be forcibly returned to a war zone, that the safe zone won\u2019t actually be safe for the returnees and that Erdogan has alternative motives, hoping to use the refugees to eradicate Kurdish strongholds by sending Syrians from all different ethnic groups and regions into a predominantly Kurdish area.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump referred to these plans Wednesday, saying the United States helped achieve a safer area between Turkey and Syria, including \u201ca 20-mile-wide safe zone. An interesting term \u2018safe zone\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s the term we\u2019re using. Hopefully that zone will become safe. Thousands and thousands of people have been killed in that zone over the years.\u201d\n\nHuman rights advocates would say he has good reason to question whether \u201cthat zone will become safe.\u201d As some experts told The Washington Post earlier this month, plans for a safe zones could in fact create \u201cdeath traps.\u201d\n\n\u2018Bloodstained sand\u2019\n\nTrump said Wednesday that U.S. troops were never supposed to have stayed in Syria as long as they have and that Washington had done \u201ca great service and done a great job for all of them and now we\u2019re getting out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet someone else fight over this long bloodstained sand,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAs The Post reported before, Trump has developed something of a proclivity for describing Syria as, well, \u201csand.\u201d Syria has \u201cgot a lot of sand over there,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d\n\nIn January, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about sand and death, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nContrary to these statements, Syria\u2019s deserts are not very sandy but rather more dusty and semiarid.\n\nGen. Mazloum\n\nTrump said Wednesday that he had just spoken with Syrian Kurdish commander Gen. Mazloum Abdi. \u201cHe was extremely thankful for what the United States has done,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe could not have been more thankful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe had a great talk,\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe\u2019ve saved the lives of many, many Kurds. He understands that.\u201d\n\nMustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, seemed to confirm that version of events, tweeting remarks he attributed to Mazloum, thanking Trump for \u201chis tireless efforts that stopped the brutal Turkish attack and jihadist groups on our people.\u201d He also wrote that Trump \u201cpromised to maintain partnership with SDF and long-term support at various spheres.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly happened on the call, but this is somewhat remarkable considering that Kurdish officials have repeatedly accused Trump of abandoning them in Syria, and just three days ago Bali himself tweeted that Trump was encouraging what he described as an \u201congoing genocide campaign.\"\n\nAD\n\nEncouraging the ongoing genocide campaign is by far the greatest insult to our people so far. With all due respect, Mr. President, what makes you think you have the right to drive millions of Kurds out of their homes and resettle them elsewhere? Isn\u2019t this ethnic cleansing? https://t.co/FZ45jRcqie \u2014 Mustafa Bali (@mustefabali) October 20, 2019\n\nISIS prisoners\n\nKurdish forces oversee a network of detention centers holding suspected Islamic State fighters and their families, including many foreigners. Trump claimed Wednesday that Mazloum told him the detention centers were secure.\n\n\u201cGen. Mazloum has assured me ISIS is under very, very strict lock and key and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere were a few that got out, a small number relatively speaking, and they\u2019ve been largely recaptured.\u201d\n\nBut both Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Jim Jeffrey, the U.S. special envoy for Syria and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, have recently said that at least 100 suspected Islamic State fighters had escaped from detention in the area. In fact, Jeffrey\u2019s comments came just an hour before Trump\u2019s statement that significantly downplayed such concerns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nISIS defeat\n\nTrump said Wednesday that \u201cAmerican forces defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate during the last two years.\"\n\nBut both U.S. and European military and intelligence agencies have repeatedly warned that the Islamic State is not in fact defeated. While the group no longer controls land as it once did, it still has plenty of followers, including many women in the detention camps in Syria. And as the New York Times reported in August, the Islamic State may still have as many as 18,000 fighters mobilized in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAmerican forces were by no means the only troops to push the Islamic State out of its territory in Syria and Iraq. As Trump himself later pointed out, Syrians and Iraqis sacrificed by far the most troops in military operations against the Islamic State: 10,000 Syrian Kurdish fighters died fighting the group, in addition to Iraqi soldiers and civilians from both countries who were killed, wounded and displaced over the course of the conflict.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2018Ancient conflict\u2019\n\nTrump tried to justify his reasoning for troop withdrawal Wednesday, asking how many Americans must die \u201cin the midst of these ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts.\u201d\n\nThis narrative overlooks the fundamental ways in which American and Western interventions in the region \u2014 such as the Iraq War \u2014 have entirely disrupted and influenced political, social and economic dynamics, thereby contributing to the very conflicts Trump routinely derides.\n\n$8 trillion on wars in the Middle East\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump claimed the United States has \u201cspent $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East,\u201d an uptick from his earlier claims that Washington had already spent $6 trillion or $7 trillion on these conflicts. Studies estimating U.S. expenditures on these conflicts vary, but experts say it\u2019s unlikely that Washington has actually spent that much.\n\nAD\n\nCongratulations\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said it\u2019s \u201ctoo early for me to be congratulated.\u201d But he has already repeatedly congratulated himself for the \u201cbig success\u201d \u2014 even as he\u2019s faced mounting criticism at home, even from members of his own party.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Trump said he would lift sanctions on Turkey.
