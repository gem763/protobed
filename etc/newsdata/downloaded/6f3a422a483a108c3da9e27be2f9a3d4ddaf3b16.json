But that\u2019s a good starting place, it\u2019s not a good finishing place,\u2019 she told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This is a collective crisis. It requires collective action. And so, I decided to use my celebrity to try to raise the sense of urgency and I moved to Washington and I\u2019m going to get arrested every Friday.\u2019\n\nJane was one of 16 people who were charged with \u2018crowding, obstructing or incommoding\u2019, but told fans on her website that she will be back every week until something is done.\n\nShe wrote: \u2018I will be on the Capitol every Friday, rain or shine, inspired and emboldened by the incredible movement our youth have created.\n\nJane Fonda has been an activist since the 1960s (Picture: AP)\n\n\u2018I can no longer stand by and let our elected officials ignore \u2013 and even worse \u2013 empower \u2013 the industries that are destroying our planet for profit. We can not continue to stand for this.\u2019\n\nShe and her fellow activists were held for a few hours in a police cell, before each paying $50 (\u00a339.60) to be released.\n\nJane admitted that the plastic handcuffs hurt her wrists and that it was difficult for her to get in and out of the police van without her hands.\n\nShe wrote: \u2018White plastic \u2018handcuffs\u2019 were put on each of us, we were taken to the nearby police station for a few hours.\n\n\u2018The plastic handcuffs hurt more than the metal ones and I discovered that it\u2019s not easy for an 82-year-old to get in and out of a police [van] without the use of her hands. All the police women and men were super polite and nice.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJane has a long history of political activism, beginning in the 1960s when she supported the Civil Rights Movement and opposed the Vietnam war.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
