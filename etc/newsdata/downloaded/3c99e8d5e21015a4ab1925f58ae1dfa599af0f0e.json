This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the year Reuters\n\nMr Draper made a name for himself through traditional investments in companies like Skype, Tesla and Twitch, but has since turned his attentions to bitcoin.\n\nIn 2014, he purchased 30,000 bitcoins that had been seized from criminals by the US Marshals, which were worth around $21 million at the time. At today\u2019s rates, they are worth more than $300 million.\n\nHe has since been an outspoken advocate of the cryptocurrency, consistently claiming it represents the future of money.\n\nOther financial analysts have also predicted that the price of bitcoin is set to increase, though their market projections have been far more modest.\n\nNigel Green, the CEO of financial consultancy firm DeVere Group said that bitcoin\u2019s price will be boosted by the US Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut interest rates by around a quarter of a per cent this week..\n\n\u201cBitcoin is likely to break out of its recent sideways trading pattern and be given a healthy boost by the Fed\u2019s rate cut,\u201d he told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThis is because an interest rate cut reduces the incentive to keep the fiat currency. In addition, rate cuts typically lead to higher inflation, which reduces the purchasing power of traditional currencies, therefore making cryptocurrencies more attractive.\u201d\n\nBitcoin price predictions range from $1 million to next to nothing (Getty Images)In August, Mr Green predicted that geopolitical instability would see bitcoin hit $15,000, as bitcoin was becoming a \u201cflight-to safety\u201d asset during times of market uncertainty.\n\nHe cited the ongoing trade war between the US and China, as well as the unpredictable outcomes of the Brexit crisis in the UK and Europe.\n\nHe stood by this forecast following the anticipated interest rate cuts, adding that cryptocurrencies will \u201ccontinue to do well as the global economy slows and central banks ease monetary policies in response to this\u201d.\n\nMr Green is joined by several other industry figures in predicting short-term gains, with some pointing to the record bitcoin mining rates in recent days acting as a key metric towards future gains.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, CEO of one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, tweeted this week: \"[Mining] hashrate increase means more miners are investing in btc, they are bullish.
