It randomly requests Uber drivers to take a selfie before they begin a ride. The tech, which utilises Microsoft\u2019s facial recognition technology, is meant to help prevent the issue of people using cars and Uber accounts registered to other people.\n\nFollowing Singh\u2019s conviction, unnamed police sources told The Age that people are fooling the security system by holding up photographs of authorised drivers.\n\nAccording to the report, this technology loophole is being used to run illegal rackets involving up to 10 vehicles and multiple employees under a single authorised account.\n\nIn online forums posts prior to 2016 seen by Business Insider Australia, self-identified Uber drivers ask others how to beat the identification system, and are advised to use an existing photograph instead of taking a new photo. It is a breach of community guidelines for someone else to use a driver\u2019s Uber account.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider Australia, Uber denied that this is a current issue. However, the facts of the Singh case make clear the technology was not advanced enough in 2018 to distinguish between a photograph and a face. A spokesperson for Uber said the company has made strides since last year to improve its safety technology and implement Microsoft\u2019s facial recognition technology.\n\nUber confirmed to Business Insider Australia that it introduced fraud detection technology and a human review process in 2019.\n\n\u201cUber utilises a security feature called real-time ID check alongside real-time human review and fraud detection technology. Among other checks, this technology can check that the image is not an image of another photo,\u201d an Uber spokesperson said. \u201cTogether these help prevent fraud and protect riders by building another layer of accountability into the app to ensure the right person is behind the wheel.\u201d\n\nIn late 2018, it also introduced security features including an in-app emergency button for both riders and drivers, the ability to share your trip with others and, more recently, notifications that ask people to check their ride and driver details and contact them immediately if there is a mismatch.\n\n\u201cWe also provide driver photos in the app so riders can confirm it\u2019s the right person picking them up. If the driver doesn\u2019t match the photo, report it to Uber right away so we can take action,\u201d the Uber spokesperson said.\n\nThe introduction of advanced security features \u2013 in particular the \u2018check your ride\u2019 functionality \u2013 also followed the death in April of a University of South Carolina student who was murdered by a man she thought was her Uber driver but had no connection to the company.\n\nIn a change of tune, many Uber drivers are now complaining in online forums of the overly strict technology and the fact they need clear lighting and have to take a photo multiple times to be approved to continue driving. The robustness of the system is good news for passengers, but it may be making things more difficult for legitimate drivers.\n\nVictoria Police said it works closely with rideshare companies with regards to the safety of passengers.\n\n\u201cVictoria Police consults closely with stakeholders such as rideshare services to share intelligence and advice on ways we can work collaboratively to prevent and investigate crime. We are always looking at ways we can improve these relationships and combat any emerging crime issues,\u201d a police spokesperson said.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
