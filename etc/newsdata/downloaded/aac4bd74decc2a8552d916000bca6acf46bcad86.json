He had dominated Zimbabwean politics for almost four decades from independence in 1980 until he was removed by his own army in a November 2017 coup.\n\nRevered by many as a liberator who freed his people from white minority rule, Mugabe was vilified by others for wrecking one of Africa\u2019s most promising economies and ruthlessly crushing his opponents.\n\nMugabe\u2019s family is pushing back against the government\u2019s plan to bury him at the National Heroes Acre monument in the Zimbabwe capital Harare and wants him to be interred in his home village, relatives have told Reuters.", "description": "The body of Zimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe was en route from Singapore to Zimbabwe on Wednesday, five days after he died in hospital in the city-state, according to an event schedule issued by his embassy and flight data.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428549437&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A05E", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
