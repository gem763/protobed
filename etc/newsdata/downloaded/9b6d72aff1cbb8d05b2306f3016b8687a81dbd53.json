Authorities said Patterson held the teen in his cabin for 88 days, forcing her to sleep under his bed before she escaped.\n\nIn July, he was transferred to New Mexico from Wisconsin without an explanation from prison officials. The previous month, he had been disciplined at the Dodge Correctional Institution in Waupun for threatening to assault another inmate.\n\nCLOSS HONORED AS HOMETOWN HERO\n\nPatterson reportedly said: \"Say that one more time motherf----- and I will kick your ass.\"\n\nThe Green Bay Press-Gazette reported that records provided by the New Mexico Corrections Department said Patterson was approached by two inmates in the prison gym on Aug. 28.\n\nThey reportedly told Patterson to leave the pod because he couldn't \"stay in line\" because of the case. One of the inmates \"questioned his case involving a 14 year old girl.\"\n\nVideo surveillance appeared to show an inmate aggressively approach Patterson, who punched the man. Blows were exchanged and the two wrestled before a staffer fired a bean bag round that hit a railing.\n\nNo one was seriously injured.\n\nCorrections officials in both states have not revealed in which prison Patterson is being housed. He initially went to the Central New Mexico Correctional Facility in Los Lunas, a reception center for the state's prison system.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile there, he falsely claimed he met a 17-year-old girl online and helped her run away from home.\n\nThe fight raises questions about whether moving Patterson out-of-state makes him safer. The Press-Gazette reported the team who transferred him had to drive straight from Wisconson to New Mexico because no state wanted to assume responsibility for him, even for long enough to allow the team to rest.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The man who kidnapped Jayme Closs and killed her parents got into a fight with a fellow\u00a0inmate at a New Mexico prison who asked about his\u00a0crimes, raising questions about whether any prison can shield him from the notoriety brought by\u00a0the case.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19303796496860.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
