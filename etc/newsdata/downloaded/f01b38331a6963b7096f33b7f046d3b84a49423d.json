But it's unclear whether the former White House official will show up.\n\nAs they gather evidence behind closed doors, House investigators had been expected to press Kupperman to corroborate key elements of a top U.S. diplomat's account that Trump built a shadow foreign policy team around his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate a political rival \u2014 and that Trump held up U.S. military aid for Ukraine as leverage.\n\nBut Kupperman, who had been the top aide to then-National Security Adviser John Bolton, filed a lawsuit on Friday night describing himself as caught between two competing orders. He wants a court ruling on whether he should comply with the House subpoena to testify \u2014 or comply with a White House order to stay away because the nature of his job as adviser means he is exempt from the congressional order.\n\n\"Dr. Kupperman takes no position on whether the command of the Legislative Branch or the command of the Executive Branch should prevail; he seeks only to carry out whichever constitutional obligation the Judicial Branch determines to be lawful and binding on him,\" his lawyer, Charles Cooper, said in a statement.\n\nHouse investigators called the lawsuit a stall tactic and accused Kupperman of working with the White House to stonewall Congress. They sent him a letter on Saturday saying their subpoena \"remains in full force\" and said Kupperman is legally obligated to appear on Monday.\n\n\"The deposition will begin on time and, should your client defy the subpoena, his absence will constitute evidence that may be used against him in a contempt proceeding,\" the impeachment inquiry leaders said in a letter to Cooper.\n\nKupperman's lawyer said the White House had no advance notice of the lawsuit and said it was not discussed or coordinated with anyone from the White House. \"We believe the arguments of both Branches are substantial and offered in good faith,\" Cooper wrote, saying it would not be appropriate for Kupperman to resolve what he called a \"momentous Constitutional dispute.\"\n\nNicholas Rostow, who served as legal adviser to the National Security Council in George W. Bush's White House, said he expected that the congressional subpoena would take precedence over the White House claim \u2014 but he cautioned that the court may take a different view.\n\n\"The court may say this is an odd duck because the House hasn't voted on whether this is an official impeachment inquiry, so executive privilege might still apply,\" said Rostow, who has long worked with Bolton and knows Kupperman. \"It's a question the court may have to wrestle with.\"\n\nPeople who know Kupperman say they don't expect him to be swayed by politics or ideology. Dennis Ross, a former ambassador and top adviser to Republicans and Democrats on Middle East policy, compared Kupperman to Sgt. Joe Friday from the television series Dragnet, a character known for sticking to the facts.\n\n\"Charlie has always been very conservative but also honest and a straight shooter,\" said Ross, who got to know Kupperman years ago when they both were doctoral students. \"He has strong views like Bolton about Russia and Putin. Neither he nor Bolton would have turned a blind eye to what they saw as fundamentally inappropriate and wrong behavior.\"\n\nFormer Trump administration officials say Kupperman is known to follow procedures. He was an adviser to Bolton for more than 30 years and served various roles in President Reagan's administration, including in the White House and on an advisory committee on arms control.\n\nKupperman worked as an executive at defense contractors Boeing and Lockheed Martin before joining the Trump administration in January. He left the White House on Sept. 20, 10 days after Bolton and Trump parted ways.\n\nKupperman has expressed some controversial hard-line views in his past work with Frank Gaffney, the founder of the Center for Security Policy, who has advocated curtailing immigration and has repeatedly denounced Muslims, according to a former Bush administration official. But the former official said Kupperman was also known to be \"quietly instrumental\" in helping to strengthen and build National Security Council staff during his time in Trump's White House.\n\nHe started at the National Security Council two months after Bolton's first deputy, Mira Ricardel, was pushed out of her post following an argument with first lady Melania Trump's office.\n\nDespite their political differences, Ross said he never knew Kupperman to be anything but straightforward.\n\n\"It'll be the real facts,\" Ross said. \"It won't be something else. It won't be alternative facts.\"\n\nNPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe contributed to this report.", "description": "House investigators are expected to press Charles Kupperman to corroborate key elements of an account that Trump built a shadow foreign policy team to pressure the Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Franco Ordo\u00f1ez", "Mara Liasson", "Claudia Grisales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/25/gettyimages-1176345513_wide-5fab88137e9b67fc8131e5f39619a8184b260994.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
