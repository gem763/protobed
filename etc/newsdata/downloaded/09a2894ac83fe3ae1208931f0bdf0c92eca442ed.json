At the same time, the Indian government plans to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy mix from 6% to 15% by 2030.\n\n\"Today, India is sourcing its energy requirement from a different part (of the) world, Russia is one among the important destinations for us,\" Pradhan told CNBC's Tanvir Gill at the World Economic Forum in New Delhi, India.\n\nFollowing a meeting between Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin last month, the two countries announced several energy-related deals. According to Reuters, they include:\n\nIndia's Petronet LNG agreeing to buy liquefied natural gas from Russia's Novatek and invest in the Russian company's future projects.\n\nIndia's H-Energy looking to buy LNG from Novatek on a long-term basis.\n\nCoal India signing a deal to mine coking coal in Russia.\n\nThose deals and investments would help India and Russia to reach their goal of hitting $30 billion in annual trade by 2025. Bilateral trade between the two countries currently stands at around $11 billion.", "description": "India imports around 80% of its oil needs, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he wants to bring that down to 67% by 2022.", "authors": ["Yen Nee Lee"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106163720-1570157593321gettyimages-1165923237.jpeg?v=1570157662", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
