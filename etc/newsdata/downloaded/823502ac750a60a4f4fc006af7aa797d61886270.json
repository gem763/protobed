In many cases the Taser was combined with other force such as restraint holds, pepper spray, or batons.\n\nWith the introduction of the BolaWrap, police departments are equipped with a safer alternative in situations that do not call for deadly force.\n\nDavid Wood, the assistant chief of police in Aransas Pass, Texas, told the local ABC News affiliate that he sees the BolaWrap as a \u201csafer or less violent way that's less likely to injure the person or get the officer injured in the process.\u201d", "description": "The new device is called the BolaWrap.
