That document alleged that Trump pushed Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s family, prompting a White House cover-up. Crucially, the new whistleblower works in the intelligence field and has \u201cfirsthand knowledge\u201d of key events, Zaid said.\n\nThe emergence of the second whistleblower threatened to undermine arguments from Trump and his allies to discredit the original complaint. They have called it politically motivated, claimed it was filed improperly and dismissed it as unreliable because it was based on secondhand or thirdhand information.\n\nA rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, released by the White House, has already corroborated the complaint\u2019s central claim that Trump sought to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The push came even though there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president or his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nText messages from State Department officials revealed other details, including that Ukraine was promised a visit with Trump if the government would agree to investigate the 2016 election and Ukrainian gas company Burisma \u2014 the outline of a potential quid pro quo.\n\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said word of a second whistleblower indicates a larger shift inside the government.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s real problem is that his behavior has finally gotten to a place where people are saying, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d Himes said.\n\nDemocrats have zeroed in on the State Department in the opening phase of their impeachment investigation. The Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees have already interviewed Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine who provided the text messages. At least two other witnesses are set for depositions this week: Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly ousted as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May.\n\nTrump and his supporters deny that he did anything improper, but the White House has struggled to come up with a unified response. No administration officials appeared on the Sunday news shows to defend the president, while other Republicans focused mainly on attacking Democrats. A few Republicans suggested that Trump was only joking this past week when he publicly called on China to investigate the Bidens.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump\u2019s most vocal backers, provided perhaps the strongest defense of the president. He said there was nothing wrong with Trump\u2019s July conversation with Zelenskiy and that the accusation look like a \u201cpolitical setup.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump, rather than visiting his nearby golf course in Sterling, Virginia, for a second day, he stayed at White House, where he tweeted and retweeted, with the Bidens a main target.\n\n\u201cThe great Scam is being revealed!\u201d Trump wrote at one point, continuing to paint himself as the victim of a \u201cdeep state\u201d and hostile Democrats.\n\nAs the president often does when he feels under attack, he trumpeted his strong support among Republican voters. He kept lashing out at Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, one of the few Republicans who has publicly questioned Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are lucky that they don\u2019t have any Mitt Romney types,\u201d Trump wrote, painting the 2012 GOP presidential nominee as a traitor to his party. Romney tweeted recently that Trump\u2019s \u201cbrazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine\u201d for an investigation of Biden is \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nThe July call raised questions about whether Trump held back near $400 million in critical American military aid to Ukraine as leverage for a Burisma investigation. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Ukraine. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nA leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Biden wrote in The Washington Post that he had a message for Trump and \u201cthose who facilitate his abuses of power. ... Please know that I\u2019m not going anywhere. You won\u2019t destroy me, and you won\u2019t destroy my family.\u201d\n\nAdditional details about the origins of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelenskiy emerged over the weekend.\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry had encouraged Trump to speak with the Ukrainian leader, but on energy and economic issues, according to Perry spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes. She said Perry\u2019s interest in Ukraine is part of U.S. efforts to boost Western energy ties to Eastern Europe.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly described his conversation with Zelenskiy as \u201cperfect,\u201d told House Republicans on Friday night that it was Perry who teed up the July call, according to a person familiar with Trump\u2019s comments who was granted anonymity to discuss them. The person said Trump did not suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAs the furor over Trump\u2019s phone call and the House\u2019s subsequent impeachment inquiry escalated, two Republicans challenging Trump for the GOP presidential nomination engaged in a heated on-air debate over what should happen to the president. The exchange between former Reps. Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Joe Walsh of Illinois was notable, given the refusal of all but three Republican senators to criticize Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nWalsh said the president deserves to be impeached. Sanford tried to make the case that moving forward with impeachment in the Democratic-run House if the Republican-controlled Senate doesn\u2019t have the votes to convict would be counter-productive.\n\n\u201cThis president needs to be impeached, just based on what he himself has said,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cAnd Republicans better get behind that.\u201d", "description": "A second whistleblower has spoken to the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog and has information that backs the original whistleblower\u2019s complaint...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS534_19trum_ZG_20191002210940.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
