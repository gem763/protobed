It's about putting a strong message out that we need to do more in our society to stop this from happening.\"\n\n(Image: Wales News Service WS)\n\nRachel described her youngest son Jack as strong-willed and said his death came as a shock.\n\nShe added: \"He was very outgoing, popular and never had any problem with his health, certainly not any mental health issues until the shooting.\n\n\"He was a popular boy in school and was a bit of a Jack-the-lad but he was a loving boy. He was the first to put his shoes on and help me with the shopping from the car.\"\n\n(Image: Wales Online WS)\n\nRachel, who is now married to Mike and has an older son Josh, said she would never get over losing her child but said \"time was a great healer\".\n\nShe added: \"Eight years on from losing a child, you learn to live with it and I have got a strong Christian faith.\n\n\"Sharing the photo is not something significant I would hold on to as a memory to him, it was an easy decision to make and the response from Twitter has been worth it.\n\n\"We have got to bring home that we're dealing with domestic abuse and perpetrators, and victims and survivors are speaking out against it.\"", "description": "Jack Williams, from Newport, Wales, witnessed the sickening campaign of abuse Darren Williams carried out on his wife Rachel", "authors": ["Philip Dewey", "Image", "Wales News Service Ws", "Wales Online Ws", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20646231.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Jack-Williams.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
