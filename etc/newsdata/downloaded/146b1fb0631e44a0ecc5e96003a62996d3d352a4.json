Macy Bought the Grad Balloons Himself", "language": "en", "text": "William H. Macy. Photo: GEDU/Terma / BACKGRID\n\nEsteemed character actor William H. Macy has stepped out with balloons. This would not be news except for the crucial fact that Macy\u2019s wife, Felicity Huffman, recently pleaded guilty to wire fraud in connection to the college admissions scandal and the balloons he is carrying happen to be graduation balloons. His 18-year-old daughter Sofia Grace is graduating from the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts soon. Macy himself wasn\u2019t named in the scandal, though the so-called Operation Varsity Blues did uncover that Huffman paid to boost her daughter\u2019s SAT scores without her knowledge. But anyway, back to the photo: There\u2019s just so much to ponder here. There\u2019s Macy\u2019s downward gaze, the lighthearted exclamation points of the balloons, what appears to be the sign of a Ralph\u2019s in the background. It\u2019s a tableau of Americana, latticed with ambition and despair. The Coen brothers wish they had staged this.", "description": "Gaze at a photo of William H.
