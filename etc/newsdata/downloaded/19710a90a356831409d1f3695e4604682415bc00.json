Particular innovative and aerodynamic features concern the design of the seat-stays between the saddle and rear wheel and the handlebars.\n\nThe bike will be ridden at the Minsk Arena this weekend at the Track Cycling World Cup and then again at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow the following weekend.\n\nNew rules mean that all teams competing in the Olympics in Japan next summer must use their bikes during the World Cup series but, once unveiled, teams cannot make further changes in order to stop rivals from replicating other designs. The appearance of the bike has so far been kept secret, with anyone who sees it forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement.", "description": "Team GB\u2019s new track bike for the Tokyo Olympics will draw inspiration from the iconic Lotus design that Chris Boardman famously rode in 1992 en route to Britain\u2019s first Olympic cycling gold since 1920.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cycling/2019/10/30/214582092_COPYRIGHT-OF-JAMES-CHEADLE-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0Z2z1rJXtHoOClGD0I239s81dhAdHRz5eiuPvx5oT7w.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
