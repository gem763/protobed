According to the homeowner, who only gave his name as Alex, the man took his shoes off before entering the home\n\nThe man can be seen climbing in to the Alex's wife car. He gained access to the property by gaining access to the car which held the garage door opener\n\nHere's the location, before the stairs, that Alex said the burglar took off his shoes before robbing the house\n\nThe couple said that the burglar got into the house by first gaining access to their car in the garage.\n\n'A guy was able to break into my car. Which allowed him to get the garage door opener. Which allowed him to get inside the house,' the homeowner, Alex, told Click2Houston.\n\nOnce the criminal was inside, he took his shoes off before starting his robbery spree.\n\nHe first took what he could from the home office and second-floor bedrooms. Then, he swiped an Ipad that was charging in the bathroom; all with his white trainers in hand.\n\nAfter he was through plundering the homeowner's possessions, he can be seen with his shoes still off about to take off in Alex's wife's car. The homeowners did say that he remembered to close the door on the way out\n\n'He is literally three feet from the head of my bed where we are sleeping. It's unbelievable. It is extremely scary,' Alex said.\n\nHe added that he was glad they didn't wake up because he thought the invader was carrying a pistol from the footage.\n\nThe man moved the whole way through the home before leaving in Alex's wife's car.\n\nAfter getting past the garage door, he even got out of the car to lock it again.\n\nPolice said they are searching for the suspect.", "description": "A couple in Riverwest, Milwaukee awoke on Friday morning to find their home had been plundered.
