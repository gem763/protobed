The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nPublic awareness about period poverty, the inability to access menstrual hygiene products, has ignited a movement calling for free and accessible pads and tampons in restrooms and public spaces around the world. Period poverty impacts millions of people every day and is pervasive in US schools.\n\nAcross the country, thousands of students lack the resources to manage basic menstrual hygiene and are denied equal learning opportunities, as they often skip school or classes while having their period as a result. According to a recent study , a startling one-in-five teens have struggled to afford period products or have not been able to purchase them at all, and one-in-four teens have missed class due the lack of access to menstrual hygiene products.\n\nPeople with periods are taught from a young age that one of our body's natural processes is something to be ashamed of, and something we should go to great lengths to conceal. We're taught to hide our period products in our sleeves on the way to the restroom, and constantly check our clothes for any leaks or stains. The reality of period poverty, combined with the social stigma attached to having a period, like whispering for a tampon in the middle of class or the perception that periods are strictly prohibited as a topic of conversation, has long-lasting implications on a student's life. Rather than face the stress and shame associated with these conversations, many students just choose to skip school altogether. In fact, students reported that stress and shame were the most common emotions that they associated with menstruation.\n\nThe good news is that the menstrual equity movement has been gaining momentum, with policy proposals and pilot programs getting adopted in high schools and on university campuses, as well as legislation calling for the elimination of the 'tampon tax' or 'pink tax' at the state and municipal levels.\n\nFor example, Ohio recently passed a proposal repealing the state's sales tax on menstrual products in the House with unanimous support . Connecticut eliminated the \"tampon tax\" in 2016 as part of the S 502 bill , which went into effect in July of 2018.", "description": "Period poverty impacts millions of people every day and is pervasive in US schools.", "authors": ["Nadya Okamoto", "Maria Molland For Cnn Business Perspectives", "Maria Molland For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191021150336-female-teenager-school-bus--stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
