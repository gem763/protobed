There is a drop-off point too, to encourage people to resell their items with us if they have a value of \u00a3200 or more.\u201d\n\nThere are, of course, thousands of existing places to buy second-hand and vintage clothing, from boutiques to flea markets, charity shops and online marketplaces.\n\nVestiaire Collective, Moizant says, has more than a million products available to buy on its website at any given moment, uploaded by sellers from all over the world. The beauty of visiting its boutique within Selfridges will be that the selection of products will have been curated by an expert who has already done the hard trawling for you.\n\n\u201cThe shop will display 200 pieces at any time, including ready-to-wear, accessories and leather goods by luxury and affordable brands, from Isabel Marant and Gucci, to Herm\u00e8s. We have a huge inventory on the website and we wanted to show the most rare and interesting pieces when translating that into a boutique. The second-hand pieces will be surrounded by newness, so the way to stand out is to offer an amazing product and allow customers to experience that thrill of the hunt, which you get when you find a rare piece that no one else has.\u201d", "description": "Where once they were the leading destinations to discover something new, Britain\u2019s iconic department stores are now looking to sell us what\u2019s old.", "authors": ["Caroline Leaper", "Senior Fashion Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000214493586-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqG0T6zsWKXhWl85lXUYuEheVcI23MU9i46DgwJt8t-8I.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
