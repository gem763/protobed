I\u2019ve got a book coming out in October called How America\u2019s Political Parties Change (And How They Don\u2019t), on the history of our 185- and 167-year-old political parties, and I can report that things like this have happened before. One example of many: Franklin D. Roosevelt, undeniably a great president, especially as a war leader, but one whose policies also drove some prominent members of his own party to the opposition and some of whose actions seemed, well, eccentric.\n\nLike sitting in bed in 1933, and setting a new price of gold, up 21 cents one day because, as Amity Shlaes recalls in The Forgotten Man, \u201cit\u2019s a lucky number, because it\u2019s three times seven.\u201d Sounds sort of like setting tariffs in tweets. Or setting up a ramshackle National Recovery Administration charged with setting prices and wages for 700 industries, a law ruled unconstitutional by a 9-0 Supreme Court.\n\nRoosevelt supported Democrats\u2019 traditional policy of low tariffs, but left implementation to subordinates suxh as Secretary of State Cordell Hull, which looks something like Trump\u2019s desultory support of Republican tax cuts.", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Barone", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion The-Trump-Era-Is-Not-As-Extraordinary-As-Never-Trumpers-Think"], "top_image": ""}
