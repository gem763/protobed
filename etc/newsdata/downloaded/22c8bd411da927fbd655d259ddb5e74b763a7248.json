The East Surrey MP called on them to unite and fight back against the drift to the extremes.\n\n\u201cI listen to ministers undermining the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cMinisters questioning experts because their views are inconvenient for what the government is saying about no deal. You have a government that says law enforcement is the centrepiece of its platform, and yet says in another breath that it will pick and choose what laws it chooses to respect.\n\n\u201cThis is in many ways undermining key pillars of our constitution and the functioning of our democracy. The issue for me is not just Brexit. It is beyond Brexit \u2013 how you conduct politics and the veering towards populism and English nationalism.\u201d\n\nGyimah is the first of the 21 Tory rebels who were stripped of the party whip for voting against the government for a bill to block no deal to join the Lib Dems. Swinson\u2019s party hopes that support from liberal Tory voters can deliver them their best ever general election result should a poll take place in the next few months.\n\nThe former minister, regarded as a rising star in Theresa May\u2019s administration, is the sixth MP to defect to the Lib Dems this year and follows former Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Angela Smith, and fellow former Tory MP Phillip Lee.\n\nThe latest defection will be a further boost to Lib Dem morale as the likelihood of a general election grows amid continuing Brexit turmoil. Gyimah\u2019s switch of allegiance means the Lib Dems now have 18 MPs, up from 12 at the 2017 election. The party has recently updated its targets for a snap election and believes that there are now more than 100 seats \u201cin play\u201d.\n\nWriting today in the Observer Swinson says: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats are the strongest Remain party in the UK, and we continue to grow, adding members, councillors and MPs. When a general election comes, we will be ready for it and ready to take our clear, pro-European message to the country.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson is damaging Britain, while Corbyn betrays Labour values Read more\n\nIn an attempt to further sharpen the party\u2019s pro-remain message, conference delegates will vote on Sunday on whether to reverse Brexit without a referendum by revoking article 50 if they form the next government. Ahead of that vote Swinson says: \u201cWe want to stop Brexit, and if the Liberal Democrats win the general election then we will revoke article 50. Our country deserves better than Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. The Liberal Democrats are the positive, hopeful alternative that the country needs.\u201d\n\nThe defection came as Johnson prepared to strike an uncompromising tone at a key Brexit meeting in Luxembourg on Monday with European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. He will tell the two EU power brokers he will refuse to ask for an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership past 31 October in any circumstances, meaning that he will be prepared to defy the UK parliament and drive the UK out of the EU with no deal if an agreement cannot be reached by mid October.\n\nThe shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer warned the prime minister that if he refused to seek an extension he would be breaking the law and would have to face the consequences. \u201cIf the prime minister thinks Parliament is going to stand by while he breaks the law, then he has another think coming,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the latest defection and a period of extraordinary turbulence at Westminster, Johnson\u2019s determination to defy parliament, and frame the Brexit battle as one between obstructive MPs and the people who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum, seems to be bolstering support for his party.\n\nThe latest Opinium poll for the Observer on Sunday shows that the Tories have a 12-point lead over Labour, up two points on 37%. Labour remains on 25%, while the Lib Dems are down one point on 16%. The Brexit party is unchanged on 13%.\n\nGyimah said that under Johnson the foundations of British democracy were being shaken. \u201cThere is a scorched earth approach to delivering Brexit by 31 October at the risk of our institutions, at the risk of our democracy, at the risk of our economy. That should not be allowed to happen.\u201d", "description": "The MP says he has joined Jo Swinson\u2019s party to fight No 10\u2019s \u2018scorched earth approach\u2019 to leaving the EU", "authors": ["Michael Savage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3884e6b61ce8f56edd8f8b095da6224bd077fc55/0_128_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22bb7edb21611585a4ae4eb4178691c4", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
