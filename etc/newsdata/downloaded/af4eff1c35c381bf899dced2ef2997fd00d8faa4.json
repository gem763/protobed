I wasn't eating or sleeping. He was horrible to me.\n\n\"I felt frightened as I knew when he was going to switch. He never gave me time to think on my own and to be on my own. He would say he was never going to hurt me - but he did.\"\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\nAt Manchester Crown Court Judge Richard Mansell QC praised Miss Rechelle as Booth, also of Glossop, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, assault by beating, escaping custody and possession of a bladed article following the stabbing last February 2.\n\nHis not guilty plea to attempted murder was accepted.\n\nThe judge told her: \"You have been brave in the extreme. You have not just protected yourself you have protected other women.\"\n\nHe then told Booth: \"Zahra had had warnings from her friends not to get involved with you.\n\n\"When at home you would bully and degrade her by spitting, flicking cigarettes and throwing household items.\n\n\"She describes how you could change suddenly without any warning and regularly picked arguments with her leading to violence.\n\n\"A particularly disturbing feature of your violence is grabbing a woman around the neck tightly as if strangling her, which can only be intended to subdue, control and strike fear into her.\n\n\"Zahra says how she had previously been a strong person but living with you had ground her down, losing two stone in weight due to stress.\n\n(Image: Zahra Rechelle/ Cavendish Press)\n\n\"She felt particularly vulnerable due to her personal circumstances and she felt trapped in this relationship.\n\n\"Your claim is that she gave off mixed signals, you point to various exchanges of text messages which you claim demonstrates a genuine desire on her part to resume the relationship.\n\n\"But I approach these with considerable scepticism. She acknowledges she would often try and appease you because of her fear that you would become violent.\n\n\"Any expression of love in this situation is as likely to be born out of a necessity of self-preservation.\n\n\"On that night she went home to bed.\n\n\"You turned up and demanded to be let in. You tried to kick her door in, she called 999 and the recording of that call was played in court, because it is utterly harrowing I have not required it to be played.\n\n\"She can be heard crying a pleading to the operator to hurry up before a blood curdling scream of terror as you smash a window to get in and immediately set about beating her up.\n\n\"She dropped her phone on the carpet but your voice can be heard in the background saying 'I will f**king kill you'.\n\n(Image: Zahra Rechelle/ Cavendish Press)\n\n\"This was a sustained and brutal assault on a defenceless woman. The officers describe seeing you stabbing her in a continued and precise manner and you were trying to inflict as many wounds as possible.\n\n\"I watched her carefully throughout the court hearing when she thought she would be giving evidence, she is still deeply traumatised by this offence.\n\n\"She has suffered serious psychological harm at your hands.\n\n\"She was particularly vulnerable as a result of your controlling, coercive and manipulative behaviour.\n\n\"You are a dangerous young man with a capacity for sudden outbursts of extreme violence as well as controlling and coercive behaviour towards partners.\n\n\"You present a risk to people generally in a social context and towards women in the context of a relationship.\"\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\nHis counsel Sara Haq said in mitigation: \"He fully acknowledges his appalling behaviour on the night of this incident and acknowledges nothing can ever explain or justify his behaviour in any way.\n\n\"He wishes to extend his apology directly to the victim but in the weeks leading up to this incident there were hopes of a future relationship between both parties.\n\n\"He should have kept away rather than let his emotions get the better of him this night.\"\n\nBooth was jailed for 14 years and will be on licence until the year 2039 following his release.", "description": "Zahra Rechelle was on the phone to police when her ex broke in and she let out a blood-curdling scream as he attacked her, a court in Manchester was told", "authors": ["Timothy Gallagher", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Cavendish Press", "Manchester", "Ltd", "Zahra Rechelle"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529660.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Cavendish-Press-Manchester-Ltdjpgs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
