Qatar has mitigated the threats it faces by making itself visible, relevant and important,\u201d said Chadwick.\n\nQatar is embroiled in a bitter two-year dispute with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates which accuse Doha of backing Iran and radical Islamists.\n\nThey have cut direct transport links, closed airspace to Qatari aircraft and restricted their citizens from visiting over the claims, which Doha denies.\n\nBy hosting such events, Qatar \u201chas a degree of protection against some of the threats,\u201d Chadwick said, adding that the 2015 World Handball Championship and the 2016 cycling Road World Championships were also poorly attended.\n\nFIFA would now seek clarity about Doha\u2019s ticketing strategy following the sight of a near-empty stadium on some days at the athletics, he added.\n\n\u201cPeople want to know \u2014 is there going to be somewhere nice to stay, can they buy a beer?\u201d Chadwick said.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of event ecosystem are they constructing around that ticketing strategy? You\u2019ve got to give people reasons to be there.\u201d\n\nQatar World Cup organisers declined to comment on the ticketing challenges at the athletiics but sought to head off fears around the World Cup, including alcohol prices in the conservative Gulf monarchy.\n\nOfficials also sought to reassure LGBT fans their safety would be assured as they showed off rapidly evolving World Cup infrastructure to visiting media ahead of the athletics.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Qatar no more\u2019? \u2013\n\nAnother recurring issue was the heat in the road races, with some competitors berating organisers for the sweltering temperatures and humidity during the marathons and race walks that were held outside the air-conditioned stadium.\n\nCanada\u2019s Lyndsay Tessier, who placed ninth after 28 of her 68 rivals dropped out of the women\u2019s marathon, told AFP it was \u201creally scary and intimidating and daunting\u201d seeing competitors collapse.\n\nBut World Cup organisers insisted to visiting media that 2022 will not be dogged by high temperatures as it will be staged in the winter months and played in air-conditioned stadiums.\n\nChampionships spectators faced grim traffic jams across Doha with many key roads and junctions undergoing construction, although competitors and VIPs received police escorts.\n\nCongestion surged when the Al-Sadd football team hosted Saudi outfit Al-Hilal at home on Tuesday, just minutes away from the Khalifa Stadium. It also highlighted that soccer is more popular than athletics among Qataris, despite the fact that thousands of locals packed the stadium to see home hero Mutaz Essa Barshim retain his high jump title on Friday.\n\nPressure is also mounting on the authorities to open all 37 metro stations, of which only 13 are currently operational, by the promised New Year deadline.\n\nChadwick said Qatar was \u201cskating on thin ice\u201d following the challenges of the World Championships.\n\n\u201cThey have to get the World Cup right otherwise, after 2022, there\u2019s going to be a question about what happens next,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf sports governing bodies walk away saying \u2018Qatar no more\u2019, then that does expose Qatar again to geo-political vulnerability.\u201d", "description": "Doha (AFP) \u2013 Despite triumphs on the track, Qatar has come under fire for its hosting of the World Athletics Championships with questions raised", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/333c18_shelly-ann-fraser-pryce-produced-stellar-performance-win-women-100m-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
