It\u2019s sort of like the State of the Union in the United States. The political class watches it intensely, but the broader public might not follow every word.\n\nWhy is this time different?\n\nHong Kong is in political crisis. Pro-democracy protests have continued for more than four months, and they seem to be getting more violent. Mrs. Lam faces pressure to use this speech to help defuse the crisis. All eyes will be on her. But she is unlikely to address issues that the protesters have emphasized, including free elections and greater police accountability. So tensions are likely to continue for some time.\n\nWhat are you expecting her to say?\n\nMrs. Lam has said she plans to focus on economic issues in her speech, including increasing the supply of affordable housing. The government believes Hong Kong\u2019s vast inequality is the root of the unrest. But many protesters will tell you that they care about politics, not economics. They want Hong Kong to have greater autonomy from Beijing, and they say they will not rest until the government grants free elections.\n\nRelated: Hong Kong\u2019s demonstrators have started boycotting or vandalizing global businesses, including Starbucks and the video game company Activision Blizzard, that they perceive as being sympathetic toward the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nLeBron James: The Los Angeles Lakers star said that an N.B.A. executive\u2019s post about the Hong Kong protests could have endangered traveling players.\n\nU.S. Democrats face off again\n\nIn a few hours, 12 Democratic presidential candidates will take the stage for the biggest American primary debate in history.", "description": "What will Carrie Lam say?", "authors": ["Alisha Haridasani Gupta"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/briefing/16Briefing-Asia-promo/16Briefing-Asia-slide-E98C-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
