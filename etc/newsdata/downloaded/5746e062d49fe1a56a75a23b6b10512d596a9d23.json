A phone call is so anxiety-inducing that the recipient is caught between either silently waiting for the ringing to stop or experiencing the stomach-sinking adrenaline rush of answering with a \u2018hey, what\u2019s up?\u2019.\n\nNo wonder Ofcom has found that phone calls are dying out, with one in four of us making fewer than five calls on our mobile phones a month. I\u2019d guess that those five calls are for the doctor\u2019s offices and hair salons that refuse to allow online booking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in spite of all the horror and misery around phone calls, it would be a huge shame if we stopped making calls entirely.\n\nPhone calls can be a truly wonderful way to connect \u2013 something that\u2019s hugely important considering the epidemic of loneliness that\u2019s reaching every corner of society.\n\nThere\u2019s something about a phone conversation that inspires honesty and openness in a way texting and messaging doesn\u2019t.\n\nWe need to reclaim phone calls as a vital form of connection (Picture: Getty)\n\nThere\u2019s no time to edit your responses to make you seem like you\u2019ve got your sh*t together. If someone asks you a question over the phone, you do eventually have to answer \u2013 and they\u2019ll be able to hear in your tone whether you\u2019re upset, pissed off, or tired.\n\nIt can even be a more honest type of communication than talking IRL. Not having to look someone in the eye can embolden you to say things that would feel too awkward or painful face-to-face \u2013 that\u2019s why you\u2019ll often find phone calls with a friend turning into impromptu therapy sessions.\n\nPhone calls are intimate. They\u2019re a way to dive inside another person\u2019s life while they\u2019re comfortable in their own environment, allowing social interaction for anyone who\u2019s not able to leave the house or can\u2019t afford to go out for drinks and a catchup. They let friendship span across miles and countries without the need for expensive train tickets and put-off plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink of the times before texting was so common, when a phone call with someone you fancied would drag out into hours of late-night laughter, a walk to the bus stop was filled with speedy recaps of your day, and you\u2019d call your mum to verbally guide you through how on earth you roast a chicken in an oven that\u2019s quite clearly too small.\n\nThe trick to turning phone calls from something of horror into an important moment is simple: plan your calls in advance.\n\nWe need to reclaim phone calls as a vital form of connection in a time when our mental health is \u2013 generally speaking \u2013 in dire condition and we desperately need to just talk.\n\nGet rid of the anxiety of a mystery phone call by agreeing to chat with a friend, a partner, a parent at a set day and time for as long as you can. Free yourself from the worry of what needs to be spoken about, the desire to check your phone to see what time it is, and the anxiety of your phone\u2019s battery running out midway through (if you plan in advance, you\u2019ll have a charger handy and be sat close enough to an outlet).\n\nWe need human connection, and when highly edited messaging isn\u2019t enough, and face-to-face conversations feel too daunting, time-consuming, or difficult, phone calls are the answer.\n\nMORE: Doctors should prescribe technology to tackle loneliness, report urges\n\nMORE: Sainsbury\u2019s is testing out talking tables to combat loneliness\n\nMORE: Why you should hold your iPhone in your right hand to make phone calls\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Few things fill a person with dread more than an unexpected phone call.
