WARNER BROS. PICTURES\n\nThough Joaquin Phoenix's dark new movie \"Joker\" has only been in theaters for a little more than a week, it's already getting the remake treatment with an unexpected protagonist.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" offered up the perfect parody of \"Joker\" with its fictional origin story trailer of longtime Sesame Street resident Oscar the Grouch, with \"SNL\" host David Harbour starring at the center of the \"next gritty antihero origin story\" (apparently directed by \"Joker\" director Todd Phillips).\n\nHarbour's Oscar starts off in the \"Grouch\" trailer as a grumpy garbage man, lamenting that things are getting worse on Sesame Street, from \"hookers and pimps on every corner\" to Ernie dying in Bert's arms after being stabbed in a rubber ducky robbery. It all makes him feel, well, \"grouchy.\"\n\nSoon enough, he's applying green face paint, crawling into his signature trashcan and aiming a gun at the camera. \"If everyone calls you trash, if everyone treats you like trash, why don\u2019t you just become trash?\" he says.\n\nOscar even recreates the scene where the Joker is dancing on the stairs. \"Would you do me one favor? Would you call me the Grouch?\" he says at the end of the trailer.\n\nBig Bird, Count Dracula, Cookie Monster and Elmo make appearances in the dark trailer, and they're far from their cheery \"Sesame Street\" selves.\n\nWatch the full trailer below.\n\n'SNL': David Harbour finds Pete Davidson in the Upside Down in 'Stranger Things' monologue\n\n'SNL' skewers LGBTQ town hall with Billy Porter, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Woody Harrelson cameos\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/13/snl-joker-parody-sesame-street-oscar-the-grouch-david-harbour/3968189002/", "description": "David Harbour stars as a gritty Oscar the Grouch in the \"SNL\" trailer that parodies Sesame Street and Joaquin Phoenix's new movie, \"Joker.\"", "authors": ["Anika Reed", "Published A.M.
