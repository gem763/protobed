U.S. West\n\nTexas Intermediate futures were down 37 cents at $55.38.\n\nSaudi Arabia's new energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin\n\nSalman, said deeper cuts would not be discussed before a meeting\n\nof the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries planned\n\nfor Dec. 5 and 6.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz said, however, his country would keep\n\ncutting by more than it pledged in a deal that has throttled\n\nsupply by OPEC and its allies by 1.2 million barrels per day.\n\nNigeria, Iraq and Russia have, at times, produced above\n\ntheir quota. A statement from OPEC and its allies, a grouping known as\n\nOPEC+, said oil stocks in industrial countries remained above\n\nthe five-year average. Oman's energy minister said \"the outlook\n\nis not very good for 2020.\" Both crude benchmarks fell sharply the previous day\n\nfollowing a report that U.S. President Donald Trump had weighed\n\neasing sanctions on Iran, a move that would potentially boost\n\nglobal crude supply. Also feeding bearish sentiment, the International Energy\n\nAgency, which advises industrial economies on energy policy,\n\nsaid surging U.S. output would make balancing the market\n\n\"daunting\" in 2020.\n\nThe Paris-based agency kept its oil demand growth forecasts\n\nfor this and next year at 1.1 million bpd and 1.3 million bpd,\n\nrespectively.\n\n\"There is not a lot of room for any waiver on Iranian crude\n\noil imports,\" said Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob, pointing\n\nto likely inventory builds in the first half of next year.\n\nSupporting prices earlier in Thursday's session, China and\n\nthe United States made some concessions in a protracted trade\n\nwar, which has weighed on oil demand forecasts, ahead of a\n\nplanned meeting in coming days. Also giving a floor to prices, the U.S. Energy Information\n\nAdministration said on Wednesday that U.S. crude oil stockpiles\n\nfell last week to their lowest in nearly a year, as refineries\n\nraised output and imports fell. EIA/S\n\nCrude inventories USOILC=ECI fell for a fourth week,\n\ndecreasing by 6.9 million barrels in the week to Sept. 6 - more\n\nthan double analysts' expectations.\n\nAt 416.1 million barrels, U.S. crude inventories were at\n\ntheir lowest since October 2018, the EIA said.\n\nThe European Central Bank meets later on Thursday and is\n\nexpected to ease policy to support flagging growth.
