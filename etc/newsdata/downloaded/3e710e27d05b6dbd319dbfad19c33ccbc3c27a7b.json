But as he turns 89 on Friday, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s recent performance has led some to question whether he is still at the top of his game.\n\nThrough Tuesday, Berkshire\u2019s A shares BRK.A, -0.64% had lost about 2.5% year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.06% has climbed 14.5% And this isn\u2019t a new trend.\n\nIn a March 2018 column, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Zweig noted that Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, +0.10% had underperformed the S&P 500 over the 10 years ending in 2017. He hypothesized that Berkshire\u2019s portfolio had grown so large that it created a significant burden.\n\nWhile size can become a problem for active managers, there is a more important factor at work\u2014the value premium in U.S. stocks has been negative for more than a decade. Since Buffett\u2019s investment strategy has always been value-oriented, this might explain the gap between Berkshire and the S&P.\n\nTo properly analyze Berkshire\u2019s performance, we\u2019ll compare Berkshire A-share\u2019s returns to Vanguard\u2019s 500 Index Fund VFIAX, +0.08% as well as to Dimensional Fund Advisors\u2019s Large Value Fund DFLVX, +0.43%, which systematically invests in value stocks. (Full disclosure: My firm, Buckingham Strategic Wealth, recommends Dimensional funds in constructing client portfolios.)\n\nThis table shows performance through Tuesday, using Morningstar data.\n\nYear to date (%) 1 year (%) 3 years(annualized %) 5 years (annualized %) 10 years (annualized %) 15 years (annualized %) Berkshire Hathaway A shares (BRKA) -2.5 -5.6 10.4 7.8 11.6 8.6 Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX) 16 1.1 12 9.7 13.1 8.8 Berkshire returns less Vanguard fund returns -13.5 -6.7 -1.6 -1.9 -0.2 -0.2 DFA U.S. Large Cap Value Portfolio (DFAVX) 7.5 -8.8 7.4 5.4 11.8 8.2 Berkshire returns less DFA fund returns -10 3.2 3.2 2.4 -0.2 0.4\n\nWhile Berkshire A shares have underperformed both the Vanguard S&P fund and DFA\u2019s value fund by wide margins so far this year, as we extend the period, we see its underperformance relative to the stock market is pretty well explained by the overall performance of large-cap value stocks. Indeed, its performance has been relatively similar to that of DFLVX over the past 10 and 15 years.\n\nAlso read: Here\u2019s how the stocks held by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway have performed in 2019\n\nThere\u2019s nothing new in investing, only the history you don\u2019t know\n\nWhile such long periods of underperformance for the value premium is \u201cunusual\u201d, Buffett knows it shouldn\u2019t be unexpected. He knows that all risky assets experience long periods of underperformance. If that weren\u2019t the case, there would be no risk for long-term investors (and there should not be any other kind).\n\nIn fact, there have been three periods of at least 13 years, and as long as 17 years, when the S&P 500 underperformed totally riskless one-month Treasury bills. And there have also been long periods when value underperformed as well. In fact, during the dot-com era, many were questioning whether Buffett\u2019s best days were behind him, as from 1995 through 1999 Berkshire shares underperformed the market by more than 6 percentage points per year while experiencing almost twice the volatility.\n\nRecency and relativism\n\nThe twin problems of recency (recent observations have the largest impact on an individual\u2019s memory and, consequently, on perception) and relativism (investor satisfaction or unhappiness and by extension, the discipline required to stick with a strategy is often determined by the performance of the portfolio relative to some index) are compounded by the problem that most investors think three years is a long time, five years a very long time, and 10 years an eternity.\n\nYet financial economists know that when it comes to risky assets, performance over 10 years is likely nothing more than noise. That is why Warren Buffett has noted that temperament \u2014 which provides the discipline to ignore what economists know are random periods of underperformance and adhere to a well-thought-out plan \u2014 is far more important than intelligence.\n\nNo more proof is required than the S&P 500\u2019s average return of negative 0.9% per year return over the first decade of this century, underperforming riskless one-month Treasury bills by 3.7 percentage points a year. Yet investors shouldn\u2019t have lost faith in their belief that stocks should outperform safe Treasury bills due to the experience of that decade.\n\nTemperament, and the knowledge that all risky assets go through long periods of unpredictable performance, is what allowed Buffett to stay the course with his value strategy. It paid off: After underperforming the S&P 500 by more than 6 percentage points a year from 1995 through 1999, from 2000 through 2007 Berkshire outperformed by an even greater 10.7 percentage points a year.\n\nBuffett\u2019s great returns have been earned by having conviction in his investment principles (investing in quality value stocks) and having the discipline to stay the course, avoiding panicked fire sales that destroy the performance of so many portfolios. The great tragedy is that while so many investors idolize Buffett, they fail to take his advice and invest just like him.\n\nLarry Swedroe is chief research officer of the Buckingham Family of Financial Services and the author of 17 books on investing, including \u201cThink, Act, and Invest Like Warren Buffett.\u201d", "description": "The big problem is large-cap value stocks \u2014 Buffett\u2019s sweet spot \u2014 haven\u2019t done well.", "authors": ["Larry Swedroe"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ413_buffet_ZG_20190829122733.jpg"}
