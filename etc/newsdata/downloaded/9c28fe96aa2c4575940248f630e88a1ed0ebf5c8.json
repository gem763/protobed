I still do attract guys that aren't serious, but I see them coming.\n\nShe continued: 'For me what's changed is that I am not actively looking for the bad boys anymore and I understand what it is I truly want. I've been on around ten dates so far and there is one who I'm continuing to date.'\n\nUpon meeting the dating coach, the model began to date a host of different men in order to keep her options open and lessen the chances of an early heartbreak. Now, she is simply enjoying getting to know new people.\n\n'The men in my life currently are very sweet,' she explained. 'I don't know yet where these relationships will go but I'm enjoying getting to know new people and experience new things. There's no rush for me.'\n\nThe model (pictured with a date) was told to practice 'rotational dating' which is not exclusively seeing one person\n\nJenna (pictured) said that rotational dating has allowed her to meet a range of new people and lessened her chance of heartbreak\n\nPrior to her journey, the model (pictured left and right) told how she didn't take dating seriously and simply expected to find a relationship\n\n'In the past I've found it hard to deal with heartbreak, my longest relationship was five years, but now that I have children, I can't wallow in any form of misery.\n\n'I have to brush myself off and carry on. Dating is nice, and I've never really done it before as I've always had a relationship.'\n\nEarlier this year, the model told This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that her attractive looks were to blame for her ongoing single status.\n\nSAMI'S ADVICE FOR SINGLE WOMEN 'Single women - rotational date! It's the fastest way to attract the love of your life, without wasting years on the wrong men.' 'Make sure your profile is representing the best version of you. Value yourself and do not pursue or chase men. 'Let them do the hard work of winning you, just like a queen deserves. And finally, remember that love matters. 'Don\u00b4t let your job and money suck the life out of you and leave you no time for dating. Love is what we are here to experience. 'Make time for it intentionally and ask for help if you're struggling vs. trying to do it alone and wasting years of your life in trial and error with men.'\n\nDuring the show she explained: 'I think I intimidate nice guys. I seem to attract guys who are only after one thing. People who think they'll have a go and just want hook ups. No one is looking for anyone that serious.'\n\nHowever, after seeking the help of the internationally recognised dating coach and founder of www.samiwunder.com, the model has seen her love life flourish.\n\nSpeaking about Jenna's newfound success in the realm of love, Sami, who is based between the UK and Germany, said: 'Like many amazing women out there, Jenna too was not valuing herself fully in the dating market.\n\n'Her profile wasn't showing her in her full power. She was still in her ''trying hard'' masculine energy on the dates, even though she is such a catch. Also, only seeing one man at a time made her waste a lot of her precious time and energy on the wrong men.\n\n'When she came to an expert, just the first few tweaks have made a radical difference in her attitude in dating and the results she is getting now. I am so confident that her soulmate is on the way.'\n\nSami's six-step process to find love, which has seen the dating coach be responsible for 145 engagements in the past three years, allowed Jenna to change her belief that all men are intimidated by her and allowed her to put her bad dating experiences behind her.\n\nThe dating guru, who shares a three-year-old child with her husband of six years Chris, said: 'I don\u00b4t believe in rules in dating. I believe that coming from the energy of confidence and clarity is way more powerful for love success for my clients than following any rules.\n\nSami (pictured) encouraged Jenna to follow a six-step process to find love and made the model change her belief that all men are intimidated by her\n\nDating guru Sami (pictured) said: 'I don't believe in rules in dating. I believe that coming from the energy of confidence and clarity is way more powerful for love success'\n\n'When Jenna came to me, her biggest block to attracting healthy love and a masculine man was her belief that men are intimidated by her success and beauty. The first thing we did together was dismantle this limiting belief.'\n\nThe expert went on to say she made Jenna see that celebrities including Beyonce and J Lo are all gorgeous and successful women and they have love - and there was no reason she couldn't have it, too.\n\n'It was important that she understood that her beauty and success made her a catch and wasn't something she had to hide or play small in order to attract a good man,' she explained.\n\n'On our private sessions, we also helped her understand that men don\u00b4t fall in love or out of love with us because of our success or looks. Those are both superficial factors that can help start a relationship but not sustain it.\n\n'Men fall in love with our essence, with who we truly are and this is what Jenna had to bring out in the dating process for herself.\n\nShe added: 'From Jenna\u00b4s point of view, this felt like a huge liberation to know that she didn't have to be less smart or attractive to have a man in her life.'\n\nJenna said she is no longer looking for the bad boys anymore and understands what it is that she truly wants\n\nThe model (pictured on holiday in an unknown location) added that rotational dating has changed her whole mindset to dating and while there are no proposals on the horizon, she is in a much better place\n\nAfter getting Jenna to change her view on the way she approached dating, Sami encouraged her to undertake a powerful mindset session on time management to ensure that the model always had time in her life to find love.\n\n'Practically, we made her lock some time on her calendar to go on dates and have some predictability around asking for baby support, so that she could step out,' explained Sami.\n\n'Working on these two things alone, helped Jenna to feel empowered and have both space in her mind and her life, for love to enter.;'\n\nNext up, the pair addressed the challenge that Jenna was attracting the wrong sort of man from her online dating profile.\n\n'We completely shifted the way she was presenting herself online from a wild and free rebel into a glamorous classy mum,' said Sami.\n\n'I wrote the profile personally for her and made sure her pictures were up to date, feminine and professional shots.\n\n'And while we both agreed that Jenna has these beautiful wild and free sides to her, only lucky men, men who have gained her trust through effort over time, deserve to see those intimate sides of her soul.\n\nSami (pictured) told Jenna that Beyonce and J Lo were both gorgeous and successful women who had found love\n\nFollowing this change, the expert claims there was immediately a 'rush of high quality men' interested in Jenna - but the real challenge was how to choose the right man for Jenna.\n\nOn their third private session Jenna and Sami agreed on the model's deal breakers - and the mother-of-two was told to choose men based solely on chemistry.\n\n'You do want that physical attraction but you also want to ensure compatibility on values and lifestyle,' explained Sami.\n\n'Plus, what Jenna was doing before our work together, was that she was only seeing one man at a time.\n\n'This caused her to waste a good three-six months dating one man and then when it didn't work out (which it often doesn't), it took more time for to recover and get back in the dating scene.\n\nShe continued: 'When Jenna came to me, I taught her how to rotational date. This is a method of dating where you see more than one man at the same time, for non-sexual connection dates, and get to evaluate several men at the same for compatibility and match. This method of dating brought up a lot of feelings of guilt for Jenna.\n\n'It was powerful for her to observe how quickly she got attached to a man she was seeing for just a few weeks and felt obligated to give him quick exclusivity and sex. Beneficial for the man but a bad idea for the woman in question.'\n\nAnd finally, Sami taught Jenna how to be in her feminine energy and let the man do the hard work of chasing her, pursuing her and giving to her.\n\n'This work has been a complete game changer for how Jenna dates,' she explained. 'The last we connected, Jenna had a handful of healthy, masculine suitors and was enjoying being courted like the queen that she is.'\n\nNow in a much happier place in her dating life, Jenna has thanked the dating coach for changing her entire mindset to dating.\n\nJenna added: 'I've recently had a very heartbreaking experience with one guy I met online, who sadly was killed in his job working in the Ministry of Defence. It's been a hard situation to accept. And very sad.\n\n'I have learned from this, not to ever judge a situation as you just don't know what's going on in peoples lives. If people disappear or go quiet on you, not to think it's something you said or did .. I can't say anymore on that.'\n\nJenna (pictured on holiday in an exotic location) now recommends rotational dating to other women and said it does not mean sleeping with multiple people but meeting for coffees, drinks, dinners and movies", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Model Jenna Thompson 36, from\u00a0Brentwood in Essex, decided to seek the help of dating guru Sami Wunder after previously claiming her beauty was the reason behind her single status.", "authors": ["Jessica Green", "Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/08/20024554-0-image-a-5_1571729282844.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
