Add Interest\n\nIf you have been watching any of the raucous Brexit debates happening now in the U.K., you might have noticed several unique personalities. Here\u2019s a brief guide to some of the most important political players:\n\nBen Stansall/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBORIS JOHNSON\n\nReferred to by some as the \u201cBritish Trump,\u201d the U.K.\u2019s new bombastic leader began his career as a journalist before entering politics. After serving as mayor of London, Johnson quickly became a leading advocate of leaving the EU, while his boss, then Prime Minister David Cameron, led the campaign to remain.\n\nAfter the Vote Leave campaign\u2019s 2016 referendum victory, the new prime minister, Theresa May, appointed Johnson as foreign minister, a position only members of Parliament can hold. He lasted in the cabinet for two years, resigning over May\u2019s Brexit plan.\n\nHe later voted against May's doomed deal twice as a member of Parliament, before changing his mind and voting in favor of it once May promised to step down and his leadership chances increased.\n\nWhen May resigned in June, Johnson easily succeeded her as prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party.\n\nAs prime minister, he made headlines for firing half of the British cabinet, kicking well-known MPs out of his party after rebelling against him, and moving to suspend Parliament, a move that many observers say was an effort to avoid scrutiny of his plan for a no-deal Brexit.\n\nJohnson recently experienced a fresh blow to his leadership when his brother, Jo Johnson, resigned from his cabinet citing a conflict between \"family loyalty and the national interest.\"\n\nStefan Rousseau/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nJEREMY CORBYN\n\nBefore his shock 2015 election as leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn operated at the left-wing fringes of his party. A socialist through-and-through, Corbyn reportedly divorced his wife over a disagreement on whether to send their children to a state school.\n\nIn his tenure as the largest opposition party\u2019s leader, Corbyn has moved Labour decisively to the left, calling for a nationalization program and appointing a self-described Marxist to lead his economic policy. Corbyn has also faced cross-party backlash over allegations of anti-Semitism and a failure to create a coherent Brexit strategy.\n\nCorbyn has been hesitant on staying in the EU, pledging to support a second referendum on membership in the EU only this July. Because Johnson's Conservative Party lost its majority, Corbyn's stance is crucial to finding a way forward on the issue.\n\nDan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nJOHN BERCOW\n\nWith his quick wit and \u201ceccentric gesticulations,\u201d the speaker of the House of Commons has become a critical figure in the Brexit crisis. Bercow serves as the procedural leader of the U.K.'s principal legislative body.\n\nWhile his position is non-partisan, Bercow has come under fire from critics who argue he has a \u201cbias\u201d against Brexit. Additionally, the speaker has faced allegations of bullying, with The Independent reporting he may face an investigation into his conduct.\n\nWiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media via Getty Images\n\nJACOB REES-MOGG\n\nLike Johnson, the pro-Brexit Rees-Mogg was once a rebel before joining the governing ranks of his Conservative Party. Serving as Leader of the House of Commons (a position different than Bercow\u2019s), Rees-Mogg\u2019s style and demeanor make him seem more like he belongs in a past century opposed to the current era.\n\nAfter his appointment to leader of the House in July, ITV obtained a list of words and phrases he banned from use in office. Some of the forbidden words include \u201cvery,\u201d \u201cyourself\u201d and \u201chopefully.\u201d\n\nThis week, Rees-Mogg was criticized for lounging on the government\u2019s front bench while leading a debate on Brexit.\n\nSimon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn addition to these personalities, several other people have the chance of playing significant roles in the Brexit crisis.\n\nLeader of the Liberal Democrat Party, Jo Swinson, has made her pro-EU party home to opponents to Brexit, attracting MPs from both main parties.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, leader of the secessionist Scottish National Party, has recently threatened a second referendum on Scottish independence.\n\nKenneth Clarke, the longest-serving lawmaker in the House of Commons (giving him the title \"Father of the House\"), was recently kicked out of the Conservative Party and exemplifies the opposition to Brexit from within the prime minister\u2019s own ranks.", "description": "If you have been watching any of the raucous Brexit debates happening now in the UK, you might have noticed several unique personalities.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/boris-01-as-gty-190906_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
