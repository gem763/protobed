He owns property and a home, which is paid for. He has never added me to any of it. He also has two children who I\u2019m sure would toss me out and sell everything if he were to pass away before me.\n\nWhen I have mentioned this, he just ignores me or acts as if it\u2019s not important. He also has a life-insurance policy for which his daughter is the beneficiary, and he has never changed that either.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Americans who were \u2018scarred\u2019 by the Great Recession changed the way they spend\n\nI have worked very hard trying to fix up the home because it was in bad shape. Now I am beginning to feel that I no longer want to keep putting my time and energy into this house, which may never truly be mine. I would appreciate any advice on this. Thank you.\n\nFed-up Wife\n\nDear Fed Up,\n\nFile this under \u201cIssues to Discuss Before You Are Married.\u201d It appears your husband has chosen Door No. 3 \u2014 that is, do nothing. That is a solution for him. It just doesn\u2019t help you. I have two solutions to your dilemma, although there are more. Let\u2019s go with the most obvious options for now.\n\nSolution No. 1: He writes a will and leaves you his house. He may not be willing to do that. Your husband has two children, and he likely believes it\u2019s fairer for them to inherit the home he paid for. We are, of course, speculating. He hasn\u2019t told you what he wants, so we are merely filling in the gaps.\n\nIf your husband dies without a will, the house will go through probate and be subject to the law in your state. \u201cMany states have rules that would provide only a portion of the estate to the surviving spouse,\u201d according to the Wilson Law Group, which has offices in Evansville and Madison, Wis.\n\n\u201cIf this is a second marriage, children from the prior marriage may be entitled to more of the estate. If this is indeed the case, the surviving spouse may be forced to leave the home, even if she had contributed to home expenses during the course of the marriage,\u201d the group added.\n\nAlso see: These are the pricey summer camps where wealthy kids go to feel \u2018normal\u2019\n\nSolution No. 2: Your husband could create a \u201clife estate\u201d in which you live in the home until you die and then it passes to his two children. That is, you have the right to live there for the rest of your life. You will be responsible for upkeep, property taxes and maintenance costs as if you were the owner.\n\nThere are drawbacks to this: If one of your husband\u2019s children racks up unsustainable debt, a creditor could put a lien on the house and claim that is part of his/her estate. You would also need to discuss with your husband what happens to the house in the event that his children die before you do.\n\nIn a similar vein, your husband could put this home in a trust, so you can live there for the remainder of your life. For second marriages, there are many kinds of trusts to provide financial support for you and your husband and, if he wished, his children. Read more about that here.\n\nIt\u2019s telling, perhaps, that you call your home \u201cthe house\u201d rather than \u201cour house.\u201d I assume that by refusing to discuss the issue, he has already given it some thought, and \u2014 I am again replacing his silence with my own narrative here \u2014 concluded that you would not like what he has to say.\n\nTalk to him over dinner in a restaurant so he can\u2019t escape. If he does flee to the restroom, do not waver from your position when he gets back. It\u2019s tough to have a marriage where there is silence, evasion, a wall instead of open communication and, I\u2019m sorry to say, a worrying lack of respect.\n\nRecommended: My fianc\u00e9 postponed our wedding, secretly bought a house \u2014 and told me I could pay rent\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
