We will take a comprehensive look to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe\u2019re cooking with 14 games tonight.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nWalker Buehler \u2013 Los Angeles Dodgers (at Giants)\n\nThis might be a good night to bet on value plays like Velasquez, Lopez, and Eovaldi. The reason is that playoff bound clubs with nothing left to play for have the best pitchers in the slate. We\u2019re likely to see artificially shortened outings. However, despite losing some of the ceiling on Buehler, it\u2019s still hard to pass up Buehler at Oracle Park. He\u2019ll face a terrible offense at a pitcher friendly venue. We should get something like six innings and seven strikeouts. Those contest leading point totals we usually dream about when rostering Buehler may be out of reach, but he\u2019s the safest pick for an above average performance.\n\nAlso Consider: Vince Velasquez (value), Pablo Lopez (value), Nathan Eovaldi (value), James Paxton, Jose Berrios\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nYasmani Grandal \u2013 Milwaukee Brewers (at Chi Chi Gonzalez)\n\nStory continues\n\nYep, we\u2019re finishing up 2019 with a Coors Field series. Grab any and all Brewers who fit into your lineup. Gonzalez is on a shockingly successful streak of four straight solid outings \u2013 two on the road against the Dodgers and two at home. There\u2019s no obvious reason to believe he\u2019s improved. This looks more like a \u201cblind squirrel\u201d situation. It\u2019s likely the Brewers will put up at least half a dozen runs tonight. With Christian Yelich waylaid, Grandal is arguably their best hitter. He bats second. His patient and powerful approach tends to produce extreme outcomes. He\u2019s likely to at least walk a time or two, and he also carries a one-in-four chance to homer.\n\nAlso Consider: Mitch Garver, Sean Murphy (value), Travis d\u2019Arnaud (value), Pete Alonso, Cody Bellinger, Max Muncy (value), Eric Thames, Edwin Encarnacion\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nGleyber Torres \u2013 New York Yankees (at Joe Palumbo)\n\nIf you\u2019re not playing Coors Field, the Yankees stack is looking second-best. They\u2019re visiting Globe Life park which is extremely offense-oriented at this time of year. More to the point, southpaw Joe Palumbo has performed terribly in a small sample of major league work. In particular, Palumbo has struggled with home runs (four in 13.2 innings). He\u2019ll probably only throw two to three innings, but that just means Torres and friends will see squishy relievers. Torres is one hot series away from reaching the 40-homer plateau. His batted ball profile matches up well against Palumbo\u2019s.\n\nConsider a flexible approach to selecting your second baseman tonight. It\u2019s an extremely deep position with bargain plays extending well beyond those listed below.\n\nAlso Consider: Max Muncy (value), Mike Moustakas, Keston Hiura, Nick Solak (value), DJ LeMahieu, Ryan McMahon, Jose Altuve, Joey Wendle (value)\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nEugenio Suarez \u2013 Pittsburgh Pirates (at Steven Brault)\n\nDepending on the platform you play, second and third base may have a lot of overlap. Considering the scalding power binge he\u2019s on, Suarez is shockingly cheap. Brault is a left-handed ground ball pitcher who struggles versus right-handed hitters. Suarez is a fly ball-hitting lefty masher. While PNC Park is pitcher friendly, ballparks aren\u2019t as much of a consideration in this juiced-ball fueled season. Suarez projects for just under one-third of a homer.\n\nAlso Consider: Mike Moustakas, Rafael Devers, Nolan Arenado, Anthony Rendon, Matt Chapman (value), Nick Solak (value), Joey Wendle (value), Gio Urshela\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nMarcus Semien \u2013 Oakland Athletics (at Justus Sheffield)\n\nSemien is a classic lefty-killer although he\u2019s posted neutral platoon splits in this breakout season. Sheffield is an unusual ground ball pitcher with shaky command. Semien\u2019s discipline, high contact rate, and ability to jump on mistakes should serve him well in this matchup. Once the Athletics chase Sheffield, they\u2019ll feast on the Mariners bullpen. This game has playoff implications \u2013 the A\u2019s are just one game up on the Rays to host the Wild Card game. Semien projects for a little under one-quarter of a homer.\n\nAlso Consider: Gleyber Torres, Trevor Story, Alex Bregman, Francisco Lindor, Manny Machado (value)\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nTrent Grisham \u2013 Milwaukee Brewers (at Chi Chi Gonzalez)\n\nOutfield is an excellent position to pack in Coors Field bats. Grisham is among the pricier options in the slate tonight, but he\u2019s still a bargain so long as he\u2019s batting leadoff. With a patient approach that sometimes crosses the border into outright passivity, he should do well against a poor-command pitcher like Gonzalez. He also makes high quality contact and can hit for power. It\u2019s the total package. If he bats down in the order, he\u2019ll still be borderline usable.\n\nSam Hilliard \u2013 Colorado Rockies (vs Zach Davies)\n\nLet\u2019s not neglect Rockies bats. You know all the big names. Hilliard is a discount power source. After hitting 35 home runs with 22 steals at Triple-A, he\u2019s hammered six deep shots in 76 major league plate appearances (no steals as yet). The 25-year-old is extremely strikeout prone, but it\u2019s not as if Davies induces many whiffs. In fact, he\u2019s a pitch-to-contact guy at sea level. He\u2019ll truly struggle to miss bats at elevation.\n\nAlso Consider: Aaron Judge (value), J.D. Martinez (value), Charlie Blackmon, Mookie Betts, Juan Soto (value), Austin Meadows, Aristides Aquino, Tommy Pham (value), Josh Rojas (value)", "description": "Brad Johnson finds the best MLB DFS Plays for Friday, September 27.
