Those additional 60 minutes sleep could, in fact, have a profound impact on your health.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the seven million Britons with heart disease, it could prove life-saving. A recent study by University of Colorado scientists showed that in the two to three days immediately after the autumn time switch, the number of potentially fatal heart attacks drops by roughly 20 per cent.\n\nAnd when the clocks jump forward an hour in the spring, heart attack rates jump 25 per cent almost immediately.\n\nWhy? It\u2019s all to do with the power of sleep.\n\n\u2018Most of us can get away with a few late nights but any more than that and you start running up a sleep debt,\u2019 says Dr Neil Stanley, a member of the British Sleep Society and author of the book How To Sleep Well.\n\nAn extra hour in bed isn\u2019t the only benefit of the clocks going back this weekend (stock image)\n\n\u2018If you are repeatedly deprived of your full quota of sleep \u2013 seven to eight hours a night for most of us \u2013 for more than about four weeks, it can become a chronic condition that could threaten your health.\u2019\n\nGrowing evidence shows the greatest toll is on your heart.\n\nLast year, a study of 460,000 Britons found that even those without family history of heart disease, who were perfectly fit and healthy, dramatically increased their risk of a heart attack by sacrificing sleep.\n\nThose averaging fewer than six hours a night were a fifth more likely to have a heart attack than those getting seven or eight hours. If they slept five hours or fewer, the risks increased by more than 50 per cent.\n\nProfessor Melvin Lobo, a heart disease specialist at Bart\u2019s NHS Health Trust in London, adds: \u2018It\u2019s not just the time you spend in bed \u2013 it\u2019s the quality of the sleep that counts.\u2019\n\nAccording to experts, poor sleep can trigger a cocktail of other common problems, causing the risk of heart attack to soar. \u2018Being exhausted during the day and awake at night can raise levels of hormones that drive up blood pressure,\u2019 says Professor Naveed Sattar, from Glasgow University\u2019s Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences.\n\nSleep deprivation also upsets the balance of vital hormones in the body that control appetite.\n\nStudies show that eating late at night \u2013 up to two hours before bed \u2013 upsets the internal body clock, or circadian rhythm, which, in turn, disrupts our metabolism. The body is less efficient at processing food for energy, causing spikes in blood sugar and blood pressure. Both of these are known risk factors for heart attacks.\n\nSleep deprivation also upsets the balance of vital hormones in the body that control appetite (stock image)\n\nToo little sleep can also harden your arteries. Sleeping six hours nightly was shown, in studies by University of Chicago researchers, to make participants three times more likely to develop fatty deposits in the blood vessels over a five-year period, compared to those who consistently slept for at least eight hours.\n\nBut a daytime snooze won\u2019t help matters. According to recent Chinese research, catching up with shut-eye during the day won\u2019t undo the damage caused by restless nights.\n\nFurther research published in the journal Current Biology in February this year showed that a weekend lie-in is unlikely to help, either.\n\nUltimately, the best defence against sleep-related health problems is simple: a few early nights. Studies consistently show that being early to bed not only protects you from heart disease, but also respiratory illness, psychological disorders and even \u2013 according to some studies \u2013 early death. So, consider setting a bedtime. Your heart \u2013 and overall health \u2013 will be better off.", "description": "A study by University of Colorado scientists showed in the two to three days immediately after the autumn time switch, the number of potentially fatal heart attacks drops by roughly 20 per cent.", "authors": ["Pat Hagan For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/16/20217072-0-image-a-6_1572102031314.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
