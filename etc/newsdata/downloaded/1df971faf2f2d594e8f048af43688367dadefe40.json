Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are at the beginning of a mass extinction,\u201d child prophet Greta Thunberg announced through tears at the United Nations Climate Summit in New York City last month, \u201cand all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\u201d\n\nInstead of deriding the stunt, as they might have, national leaders and the presumed cream of the international community clapped like trained seals eager for a fish treat.\n\n\u201cNo one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and different,\u201d Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin\u2014to his credit\u2014exclaimed scornfully. \u201cPeople in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden.\u201d And in spite of UN antics, industrial technocracy has no intention of reverting to subsistence and chronic want, nor should it.\n\nHaving risen from 2.5 billion to 7.5 billion since 1950, world population growth is historically staggering. UN projections for 2050\u2014one generation out\u2014stand at 10 billion. That\u2019s an astonishing four-fold growth in one century. The earth\u2019s carrying capacity is by many accounts being tested. Yet climate change and world population are rarely correlated today, since critical appraisals cannot but point the problem finger at fertility in Africa and the Third World.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe global desire for the comfort, wealth, and security that the First World\u2019s underclass take to be rights remains unquenched. Indoor plumbing and running water, air conditioning and heating, automobiles, refrigerators, and techno-goodies all have worldwide appeal. How to reconcile\u2014or even move haltingly toward\u2014sustainability given limitless human demands is a tough one, as is maintaining the infrastructure\u2014electricity, gas stations, irrigation, and tax systems\u2014to back up consumption.\n\nThe \u201cglobal community\u201d has limited ability to mandate what the English cleric Thomas Robert Malthus long ago called \u201cpreventive checks\u201d on population overload. In 1798, Malthus wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population. English thinkers at the time, including Malthus, feared that \u201cindiscriminate charity\u201d could lead to an army of paupers dependent on government handouts, and eventually to national bankruptcy. Moreover, Malthus warned, food supplies were expanding slower than was population. Without restraint, famine would eventually provide catastrophic \u201cpositive checks\u201d on that population.\n\nIn the Malthusian spirit, half a century ago, population apocalyptics took off. Paul Ehrlich\u2019s 1968 runaway best seller, The Population Bomb, forecast, \u201cIn the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.\u201d\n\nWhile notoriously off the mark, Ehrlich maintains that intensive agricultural techniques have simply deferred disaster. His forecasts of continued overfishing, global warming, urbanization, chemical pollution, and competition for raw materials are widely shared. Ehrlich remains a staunch statist and anti-capitalist. In a 2018 interview with The Guardian, he proposed \u201cunprecedented redistribution of wealth\u201d but observed that \u201cthe rich who now run the global system\u2014that hold the annual \u2018world destroyer\u2019 meetings in Davos\u2014are unlikely to let it happen.\u201d\n\nIn 1968, the ecologist Garrett Hardin wrote his celebrated essay \u201cThe Tragedy of the Commons,\u201d still widely studied in college classrooms. \u201cIt is clear that we will greatly increase human misery if we do not, during the immediate future, assume that the world available to the terrestrial human population is finite,\u201d he insisted. One of the most eminent scientists of his generation, Hardin argued against population growth, and advocated birth control and forced sterilization.\n\nComing from the academic left, Hardin contended that humans acting rationally in their own interests would destroy the planet. He stood firmly for state controls and against immigration. Why would an overcrowded lifeboat\u2014a rich nation\u2014take on new members, he asked, risking those capable of survival? For such thoughts, the Southern Poverty Law Center calls Hardin a \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d who is frank in his \u201cracism and quasi-fascist ethno-nationalism.\u201d\n\nChanging the subject, yet still in tune with radical environmental fashion, Susan Sontag declared maliciously, \u201cThe white race is the cancer of human history; it is the white race and it alone\u2014its ideologies and inventions\u201d that \u201cthreatens the very existence of life itself.\u201d Africa\u2019s population explosion today not only suggests Sontag was wrong, but moves remedial strategies about climate change and ecological balance in unwelcome directions.\n\nLong-term continental growth rates are very uneven. Over the last 250 years, Europe\u2019s population has doubled to 450 million, trimmed by two world wars. Since 1950, by comparison, in three generations, Mexico\u2019s population has more than quadrupled to 130 million. (The nation has exported perhaps another 15 million to the U.S.) Africa is growing at an even faster rate.\n\nSince 1950, Nigeria\u2019s population has risen from 30 million to 200 million, and is expected to double again to 400 million. Lagos, now a city of 22 million, grows in every possible direction and pushes relentlessly at its arable edges. Since 1950, Nairobi\u2019s size has soared from 140,000 to 14 million; Kinshasa\u2019s from 200,000 to 12 million. Abidjan, Dar es Salaam, Conakry, Dakar, and other sprawling African conurbations exhibit the same patterns.\n\nThe heralded African middle class that seeks to emigrate to Europe or America comes of age differently from a middle class, in, say, Frankfurt or Boston. Some grow up with running water, closed sewers, and clean hospitals. Others\u2014many more\u2014live in fetid, barely electrified slums and endless urban shanties of corrugated metal with next to no public services. These are places where life\u2014despite smartphones\u2014is brutal, filthy, insecure, and drab.\n\nSince 2010, at least a million Africans have entered Europe, and many millions more would like to. Few are equipped for their new residencies. Native-born Europeans by and large shun them. Some of these migrants are employed at menial tasks at the bottom of the labor ladder. Others become wards of the state or live as transients in an immigrant demi-monde. African migrations en masse into Europe are \u201calmost too overwhelming to contemplate,\u201d says a world-traveled London banker. The prospect is already a potent force in continental politics.\n\nIn a review of Stephen Smith\u2019s The Rush to Europe, Christopher Caldwell provides an eloquent, candid appraisal of an \u201cextraordinarily disruptive mass movement of labor and humanity from Africa to Europe.\u201d This ongoing migration, Caldwell argues, can bring Europe no benefits. The fantasy of migrant enrichment is \u201crationalization for something that Europe is undergoing, not choosing,\u201d Caldwell says.\n\nAnd Africa is political dynamite. Just ask Emmanuel Macron, who in 2017 faced the subject with some grace and realism. Taking a question on why there is no Marshall Plan for Africa\u2019s development, he responded, \u201cThe challenge of Africa, it is totally different, it is much deeper, it is civilizational today. What are the problems in Africa? Failed states, the complex democratic transitions, demographic transitions, which is one of the main challenges facing Africa.\u201d His peers and the global media viciously slapped back, ensuring that Macron never again erred in his ways.\n\nThe population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to double by 2050 from 1.2 to 2.4 billion, should fertility trends continue uninterrupted and world surpluses endure. But many nations worldwide are already dependent on a global version of \u201cindiscriminate charity.\u201d Free society abhors the idea of government-based eugenics and mandated private restraint that Malthus advised\u2014and rightly so. Not surprisingly the Chinese have stakes in Africa\u2019s future and fewer qualms than the West about imposed population control.\n\nAll the world should hope smart minds, not just in China but at the United Nations, World Bank, European Union, and U.S. State Department, are taking Malthus seriously. Nature is a powerful, ineffable system. It will be ready to curb biomass long before Greta\u2019s fantasies of mass extinction come close to realization.\n\nGilbert T.
