Mitt Romney wrote in a letter to President Donald Trump. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Congress Romney says Trump was right to not cut capital gains taxes\n\nMitt Romney is offering rare praise for President Donald Trump, hailing his decision not to index capital gains taxes to inflation as the right choice both politically and economically.\n\nThe Utah senator said skirting Congress to allow investors to effectively lower their tax rates could risk a sell-off in the markets, a stern legal challenge and a potential political backlash given the disproportionate benefit to wealthy people. So, in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Romney said he welcomes \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s focus on the welfare of American workers.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cNot only would such a change stand on dubious constitutional and legal ground, but it would primarily benefit wealthy investors without supporting American workers,\u201d Romney said of changing tax law on capital gains. Moreover, Romney warned: \u201cEncouraging investors to sell their stocks through inflation indexing could risk a sell-off.\u201d\n\nRomney has been among Trump\u2019s loudest GOP critics since joining the Senate this year, though he has taken a far less confrontational line than past detractors like Jeff Flake and Bob Corker. Romney has yet to endorse Trump\u2019s reelection, but as a senator he has praised Trump when he agrees with the president\u2019s policies, while criticizing his battles with progressive congresswomen and controversial rhetoric.\n\nMorning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Most Republicans would prefer passage of the new North American trade deal and an end to the trade wars with China than stimulus through the tax code.", "description": "In a letter, Romney said he welcomes \"President Trump\u2019s focus on the welfare of American workers.\"", "authors": ["Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/08/99/18dc25a94c79b31ddd26d993df7e/20190913-mitt-romney-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
