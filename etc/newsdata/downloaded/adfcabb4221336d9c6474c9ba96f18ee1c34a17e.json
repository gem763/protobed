All we got from the new housing minister was a commitment to try harder. It\u2019s meant to be KiwiBuild, not KiwiHope,\u201d said Collins. \u201cLabour talked a big game on housing but has failed to deliver meaningful change.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand house prices are among the most unaffordable in the world, with Auckland the seventh most expensive city to buy a home, and all three major cities considered \u201cseverely unaffordable\u201d by the latest Demographia international housing affordability survey.\n\nPrices have soared nationwide more than 50% over the past decade.\n\nArdern\u2019s centre-left government passed laws last year that restricted many non-resident foreigners from buying existing homes in New Zealand, as part of efforts to contain house price increases and reduce high rates of homelessness.\n\nDespite these efforts, the wait for a state house is at a record high under Labour and homelessness figures continue to climb around the country.\n\nReuters contributed to this report", "description": "Major climbdown as Jacinda Ardern\u2019s flagship KiwiBuild policy, designed to provide affordable housing, is dumped", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fd6b35591fc954fd6fcdc335d3c611bb5839645/0_217_3955_2373/master/3955.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2cd79099b1a769b1ef09e3f25c6b8c5f"}
