The other flipped top-first off the building on the opposite side and onto nearby Rampart Street, left sticking straight up.\n\nEngineers had hoped that the two cranes would fold like an umbrella into the building that partially collapsed Oct. 12.\n\nNEW: Video of the controlled demolition of two cranes at the Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans shows an explosion followed by one of the cranes falling to the ground. The other crane appeared to remain standing after the smoke cleared. https://t.co/j8qWmUwaJy pic.twitter.com/00IgdWjwEV \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) October 20, 2019\n\nLast week's collapse killed three workers and injured dozens more. The cause is under investigation by the New Orleans Police Department and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration.\n\nThe engineers, who have worked both on buildings damaged after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City, identified more damage than expected when preparing the massive, 300-foot cranes for demolition late last week.\n\nThey delayed the implosion several days to accommodate the shifting cranes on the side of the unstable building.\n\nInitial reports indicated the implosion did not damage nearby historic buildings, including the New Orleans Athletic Club and the Saenger Theater.\n\nOn Sunday morning, crowds gathered on the streets around the evacuation zones, despite the pleas from city officials for people to stay away. Authorities cleared blocks around the site hours before the explosion, and lifted the evacuation about a half hour after the cranes were detonated.\n\nTwo large cranes from the Hard Rock Hotel construction collapse come crashing down after being detonated for implosion in New Orleans, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019.

When the blast happened, it could be felt and heard as far away as the Lakeview neighborhood, 4 miles from the Hard Rock.\n\nTwo bodies of workers killed in the initial collapse last week remain in the damaged Hard Rock building. Authorities plan to recover the bodies when they are able to reach them.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lafayette Daily Advertiser: Hard Rock Hotel collapse: Demolition blast brings down unstable cranes", "description": "Engineers detonated two cranes at the site of the Hard Rock Hotel collapse on Sunday.", "authors": ["Todd A.
