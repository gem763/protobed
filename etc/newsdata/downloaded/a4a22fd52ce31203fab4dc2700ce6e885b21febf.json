Add NASA as an interest to stay up to date on the latest NASA news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nA team of researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is in the process of testing a 3D-printed prototype of the robot in Pasadena, California, according to NASA.\n\nNASA described the robot as \"a contraption that looks like a drone encased in an elongated hamster wheel\" which can roll and then split in two, according to a statement. Once split apart, \"the two halves rise on small propellers, effectively becoming flying drones for aerial exploration.\"\n\nJPL-Caltech/NASA\n\nThe researchers are designing up a series of a dozen robots that could also transform into a \"swimming probe.\"\n\nWhile still in its earliest stages of development by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts research program, Ali Agha of the Jet Propulsion Lab hopes to see the mini robots explore Saturn's moon, Titan, one of the only other places known to have liquid (in the form of methane seas) on its surface.\n\nMarilynn Flynn/JPL-Caltech/NASA\n\n\"We have very limited information about the composition of the surface,\" Agha said in a statement. \"Rocky terrain, methane lakes, cryovolcanoes - we potentially have all of these, but we don't know for certain.\"\n\n\"So we thought about how to create a system that is versatile and capable of traversing different types of terrain but also compact enough to launch on a rocket,\" Agha added.\n\nJPL-Caltech/NASA\n\nWhile the Shapeshifter is semi-autonomous, in future designs it will rely on fellow robots that can \"auto-assemble without needing commands from Earth,\" according to NASA.\n\n\"Shapeshifter's remarkable versatility enables access to all of these scientifically compelling places,\" Jason Hofgartner, the lead scientist for the Shapeshifter at the Jet Propulsion Lab added in a statement.\n\nWhile researchers are hard at work on designing the Shapeshifter, NASA's next mission to Titan is not scheduled to launch until 2026.", "description": "NASA's Shapeshifter robot looks like a science fiction project come to life and could explore Saturn's moon, a distant world with liquid on its surface.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/nasa-robot-ht-jt-190926_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
