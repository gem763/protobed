That contract included about $100 million in deferred salary, with the final payment coming in 2052.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe offer to Rendon, in contrast, is structured similarly to the seven-year, $210 million deal the Nationals gave to pitcher Max Scherzer prior to the 2015 season. The deferrals, according to these people, are to be paid off within the seven years after the contract expires.\n\nBoswell: Sharks are chomping at Nats Park, and we\u2019re going to need a bigger bandwagon\n\nRendon, 29, enters Tuesday\u2019s National League wild-card game coming off the best season of his seven-year career. He set career highs in home runs (34), RBI (National League-leading 126), batting average (.319), on-base percentage (.412) and slugging percentage (.598). Among NL players, only Milwaukee\u2019s Christian Yelich and Los Angeles\u2019s Cody Bellinger exceeded Rendon\u2019s 1.010 on-base-plus slugging percentage.\n\n\u201cHis season was outstanding,\u201d Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said Monday. \u201c. . . He\u2019s a consummate professional. He\u2019s as low-maintenance a superstar as there is in the game, one of the best players that nobody knows about, and he\u2019s a true credit to the scouting and player development staffs here in Washington that drafted him, signed him, developed him and watched him turn into a superstar.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn February, Colorado Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado agreed to an eight-year, $260 million contract extension \u2014 a deal that Rendon\u2019s team, led by agent Scott Boras, believed strengthened their leverage. Several teams with the ability to spend would be in need of a third baseman in the upcoming winter, including the Chicago White Sox, Texas Rangers and division rivals Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nRendon was not available to media in the clubhouse during Monday\u2019s workout day at Nationals Park, and he has been typically low-profile about his contract year. But he also has shown that he doesn\u2019t mind the idea of allowing other teams to bid for his services.\n\nNationals and Brewers enter NL wild-card game with different plans to get 27 outs\n\n\u201cI mean, if you\u2019re giving me the opportunity and saying I\u2019m this close from going to go car shopping from multiple lots, instead of staying in one lot, I mean, what would you do?\u201d Rendon said in a radio interview on \u201cGrant and Danny\u201d on 106.7 The Fan in July.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough negotiations on a new deal have been going on since spring training, people familiar with Rendon\u2019s thinking said he has indicated to ownership that he feels he has earned the right to free agency, which opens after the conclusion of the World Series.\n\nMark Lerner, now the Nationals\u2019 managing principal partner, has met personally with Rendon several times, including last week, to gauge his interest in the offer and make sure he knows how much the club would like to keep him. Part of that is due to his play on the field, but he also has been the Nats player most closely involved in the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy \u2014 an organization to which he has made several donations, including a $150,000 gift that was announced last week.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great teammate,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cBetween the lines, in the dugout and in the community, he\u2019s outstanding.\u201d\n\nRead more Nationals coverage from Post Sports:\n\nNew York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s approach to his last 15 pitches explains everything about him\n\nNationals\u2019 Dave Martinez on recent heart procedure: \u2018I was so, so scared\u2019\n\nBaseball according to Gerardo Parra\n\nCharting the wildest season in Nationals history\n\nAD", "description": "Star third baseman is expected to test the free-agent market before signing any contract.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Tpc4KY6Ov8bQ-4L5uUIWJBr-9FU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NSECPBU6ZEI6TA7DIX663DUNFY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
