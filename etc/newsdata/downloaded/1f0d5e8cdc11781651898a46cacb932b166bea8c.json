(Trump Jr. was referring to news coverage of a parody video, played during a conference at Trump\u2019s Miami golf resort, depicting a caricature of Trump murdering members of the news media and other critics.)\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Its art is a symbol. We would never condone violence. This is about taking our country back.\u201d\n\nOther ads in the campaign show models taping over Trump\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cHe unilaterally has created a gag rule that you cannot refer patients with reproductive information about abortion, sex ed, and contraception,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s gagging doctors and nurses, and telling them what they can and cannot tell patients.\u201d According to Dhvani, the model in the billboard, Michal Mesa, is a Marine Corps veteran and middle school teacher.\n\nDue to the ad\u2019s violent nature, there was some back and forth between Dhvani and Lamar Advertising, the agency that operates the billboard. \u201cThe client wanted to use a photo of the President but we said no,\u201d said Lamar Advertising\u2019s digital marketing coordinator, GraceAnn Woolf. The company insisted on a look-alike instead.\n\nBrown said there\u2019s been an increase of traffic to the company\u2019s website, along with an increase in sales, since the billboard went up.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A clothing company has put up a billboard in New York City's Times Square that depicts President Donald Trump being hog-tied by a woman.", "authors": ["Arijeta Lajka"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trump-billboard-times-square.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
