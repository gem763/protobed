ETH price is likely to resume its decline if it breaks $165 and $160.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nYesterday, we saw a nasty decline in bitcoin, Ethereum, ripple, and major other cryptocurrencies against the US Dollar. ETH price nosedived below the $185 support and traded close to the $150 level. Moreover, there was a close below the $180 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A swing low was formed near $152 and the price recently started an upside correction.\n\nIt recovered above the $160 and $165 levels. Additionally, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $211 high to $152 low. The price even traded above the $170 level. However, it struggled to clear the $175 level. It seems like yesterday\u2019s highlighted key bearish trend line is still active with resistance near $172 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nIf the price breaks the trend line resistance and $175, there could be a decent recovery. The next key resistance is near the $182 level. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $211 high to $152 low. However, the main resistance for a trend change is near the $185 level. The stated $185 level has acted as a support and resistances on many occasions. Therefore, a close above $185 is needed for a strong recovery.\n\nOn the other hand, the price could resume its decline below $165. An immediate support is near the $160 level. If there is a downside break below the $160 level, the price could accelerate towards the $150 level in the coming sessions.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near the $175 and $185 levels. As long as the price is trading below both $175 and $185, it remains at a risk of a fresh decline towards $150 or even lower.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is likely to move back into the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is currently moving lower towards the 40 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $160\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $175", "description": "Ethereum price is facing a strong resistance near $175 versus the US Dollar, while bitcoin is bleeding.
