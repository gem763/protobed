He counts $5,573,334 on the books this season and each of the next two seasons.\n\nMozgov signed with Khimki Moscow this summer. However, he hasn\u2019t played in the Russian team\u2019s first nine games.\n\nIn August, Mozgov said, via TASS:\n\n\u201cThere is some progress in my knee injury recovery, although not as speedy as it should be since it is an old-time trauma,\u201d Mozgov said in an interview with TASS. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make wrongful accusations in regard to American doctors, but their treatment of my injury was not quite correct.\u201d \u201cIt seems to me at the moment that they have been treating me based on a wrong diagnosis,\u201d he continued. \u201cNothing terrible has happened, but the injury has aggravated as the time went by.\u201d\n\nMozgov\u2019s pain could become the Magic\u2019s gain.\n\nMarc Stein of The New York Times:\n\nOrlando has applied to the league seeking to have Timofey Mozgov\u2019s remaining salary \u2026 removed from the books under career-ending injury and illness provisions, league sources say\n\nMozgov will still get the $16.72 million the Magic owe him. The big question: Will it count toward the salary cap and luxury tax?\n\nAn NBA Fitness to Play panel will rule on Mozgov\u2019s health. The Collective Bargaining Agreement requires players to cooperate, including by \u201cappearing at the reasonably scheduled place and time for examination by the jointly-selected physician.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe NBA must also determine Mozgov\u2019s career-ending injury \u201cbecame known or reasonably should have become known\u201d while with Orlando. After his last game, Mozgov got traded from the Nets to the Hornets to the Magic in the 2018 offseason. Corroborating evidence for Orlando: Though he didn\u2019t play, Mozgov was available for a 2018 Magic preseason game, according to Dante Marchitelli of Fox Sports Florida.\n\nMozgov is 33. He could certainly be finished, and perhaps Orlando knows more than is publicly available. Or maybe this is just a stab at gaining flexibility.\n\nThe Magic could use it. They\u2019re near the luxury-tax line and could be again next season and maybe even the following season. Orlando could just pay the tax in future seasons, but that seems unlikely. Getting Mozgov\u2019s salary excluded could open the door for using the mid-level exception and upgrading the roster.", "description": "The Magic have gotten expensive.
