Andy Murray, tennis champion once again.\n\n\u2018This is one of the biggest wins I\u2019ve had after everything,\u2019 said an emotional Murray after the 3-6 6-4 6-4 victory. It\u2019s hard to disagree.\n\nThis is, of course, not the biggest win of Murray\u2019s career on paper. This is a man who has won Wimbledon twice under immense pressure as a home favourite, the US Open, two Olympic gold medals, the Davis Cup.\n\nA tearful Murray revealed he could potentially retire in January (YouTube)\n\nBut this win at a relatively lowly ATP 250 event \u2013 the lowest tier of tournament on the ATP Tour \u2013 ranks among the most memorable and special moments in his glittering career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was nothing substandard about Murray\u2019s opponent Wawrinka \u2013 a symbolic opponent given the Swiss was on the other side of the net in the five-set French Open semi-final from which Murray\u2019s hip, in his own words, \u2018never recovered\u2019. Until now.\n\nThis was a final fitting of a Grand Slam or Masters 1000 event. For much of it, Murray was second best. But the man with the metal hip just doesn\u2019t know when to quit.\n\nIt looked as if he would finally throw in the towel at the start of the year.\n\nHe arrived in Melbourne a broken man. Obituaries were written after he admitted he couldn\u2019t carry on fighting through the pain in a tearful press conference. British sport mourned the loss of its greatest tennis export.\n\nHis peers, including greatest rivals Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, essentially retired him on court after a five-set defeat to Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open. Nine months on, he has made us all look like fools.\n\n\u2018I think the tennis world, including me, was really sad in Australia after that press conference,\u2019 Wawrinka said after defeat.\n\n\u2018To see you back at this level, it\u2019s amazing. We\u2019re all really happy. I\u2019m sad I lost today but I\u2019m really happy to see you back.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re an amazing champion and you deserve that.\u2019\n\nMurray came from behind to beat Stan Wawrinka (AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s set to be a joyous few weeks for Murray, who is expecting his third child with wife Kim in the coming weeks. Childbirth faces a tough task, though, in matching the pure ecstasy of this victory in Belgium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven his latest parenting commitments, this is set to be the last ATP event of Murray\u2019s season but he is expected to be part of Leon Smith\u2019s Davis Cup squad in November. Britain\u2019s chances in Madrid suddenly look rather healthy.\n\nWhat the future holds is anyone\u2019s guess. One well-respected coach is convinced that, health permitting, he will end 2020 in the world\u2019s top-five, along with rivals Federer, Djokovic and Nadal and rising Russian Daniil Medvedev.\n\nThat would have sounded utterly bonkers even two months ago. Now, belief must surely be coursing through the veins of British tennis fans.\n\nWinning a fourth Grand Slam may remain something of a pipedream, especially given his ranking \u2013 which will rise to world No. 127 on Monday \u2013 for the time being, at least, leaves him unseeded at majors, meaning he could face anyone, including the \u2018Big Three\u2019, in the first round. He will be the man every seed is desperate to avoid.\n\nAndy Murray poses with his European Open trophy (AP Photo/Francisco Seco)\n\nIn many regards, what Murray wins or doesn\u2019t from here on in is irrelevant.\n\nThis already has to go down as one of the great sporting comebacks. Nine months after going under the knife, undergoing an operation that no singles player had ever returned from, Murray has just won five matches in a week \u2013 the last three of which were three-setters to win a title in what\u2019s only the seventh singles event of his return.\n\nThree weeks ago, he thought he was playing at a level of someone who was ranked No. 60 or 70 in the world. Murray couldn\u2019t hide his surprise at what\u2019s been another phenomenal achievement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t expect to be in this position at all. I\u2019m happy, very happy,\u2019 he said. \u2018It means a lot. Last few years have been extremely difficult.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s been, and no doubt will continue to be, an emotional ride. It always has been with Murray.\n\nBut the future is bright. The sky\u2019s the limit. Murray\u2019s back.", "description": "Tears have been all too familiar during Andy Murray\u2019s hip injury nightmare, but he was living the dream once more as he sobbed courtside in Antwerp.
