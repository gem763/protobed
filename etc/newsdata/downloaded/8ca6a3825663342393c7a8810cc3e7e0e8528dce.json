The hubbub surrounding efforts to impeach President Trump has been called many things \u2014 including a witch hunt and a circus. The process itself also has been very episodic, progressing from one cliffhanger to the next as Democrats and their strategists huddle together and manufacture the next suggestive scenario, complete with talking points and buzz words. Partisan journalists are more than happy to enhance these efforts.\n\nWhich brings us to a cultural moment about the impeachment melodrama. It is just that, some say.\n\n\u201cThis is a lawyered-up script. It not an actual complaint, which this goes to my point. This is not an impeachment inquiry. It\u2019s an impeachment show for television,\u201d former U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy tells Fox News.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no inquiry. They never made a vote. And all this talk we\u2019ve heard about subpoenas \u2014 there are no subpoenas. The Democrats wrote a couple of snippy letters which make the preposterous claim that if you don\u2019t do everything we say in the letter, we\u2019re going to cite you for obstruction. That\u2019s not an enforceable legal document,\u201d Mr. McCarthy continues, offering a reality check.\n\n\u201cIf they were serious about this, they would vote on it. Then they\u2019d have an inquiry. They would issue subpoenas. But they don\u2019t want to do that because subpoenas get litigated in court. People get to move to quash subpoenas and make legal arguments against them. They\u2019d have to explain to a federal judge why they haven\u2019t voted for impeachment,\u201d he observes.\n\n\u201cThis is not the House of Representatives looking for impeachment. This is Nancy Pelosi \u2014 who has decreed that we have an impeachment inquiry.\u201d Mr. McCarthy concludes.\n\nYes, well. One Democrat also had an observation this week.\n\n\u201cThe impending impeachment hearings \u2014 are they going to be \u2018West Wing\u2019-level entertainment or more like C-SPAN?\u201d The Hollywood Reporter asked Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be full-on \u2018House of Cards,\u2019\u201d he replied.\n\nFOR THE LEXICON\n\n\u201cImpeachment Defense Task Force.\u201d\n\nNever think the GOP doesn\u2019t rally its forces. President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign has launched a new national volunteer squad to address an obvious issue.\n\n\u201cOut-of-touch Democrats are ignoring the will of their voters to pursue a baseless, unpopular impeachment witch hunt. The Democrats refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election and are on a never-ending fishing expedition to tear down President Trump. We need your help in standing up to these members of Congress across the nation to stop the madness. Tell them to end the impeachment inquiry and get back to work for the American people,\u201d the organizers advise.\n\nFind their pitch at StoptheMadness.gop.\n\nPREDICTION: TRUMP WINS THE RUST BELT\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is likely to win the Rust Belt in 2020,\u201d writes Fletch Daniels, a columnist for The American Thinker.\n\nDuring a drive through rural Michigan this week, he recalled the president\u2019s recent speech before the United Nations.\n\n\u201cIf you want freedom, hold on to your sovereignty, and if you want peace, love your nation. The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots. Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests. Those days are over,\u201d Mr. Trump told his audience.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a message the Democrats don\u2019t want America to hear. Even as Democrats failed Americans living in the inner-city areas, politicians from both parties failed the people in these rural towns, viewing them as collateral damage in their globalization crusade,\u201d Mr. Daniels observes, suggesting a simple tactic for the GOP.\n\n\u201cThe problem for the Democrats is that Trump has a simple but effective message they cannot counter. So they fall back on impeach, impeach, impeach. If the Republicans stand together, the coordinated Democrat, media, and Intelligence Community attack will fail. What the Democrats will be left with is the candidate worst positioned to actually win back the states that cost Democrats in 2016. At that point, history will be on track to repeat,\u201d the columnist counsels.\n\nWhich is, of course, the reelection of Mr. Trump in just over a year.\n\nMEANWHILE IN THE COAST GUARD\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard is changing its tattoo policy for new recruits and current service members, effective immediately.\n\n\u201cThe policy change will ensure the Coast Guard\u2019s workforce presents a sharp and professional military appearance to the public while permitting body art that is consistent with the Coast Guard\u2019s core values. Aligning the policy closer to current tattoo trends also allows the Coast Guard to increase the pool of otherwise-qualified potential applicants,\u201d the service said.\n\nThe new rules say tattoos and/or brand logos may not be visible above the collar of the Coast Guard\u2019s Operational Dress Uniform\u2019s crew neck T-shirt.\n\nOne finger tattoo per hand is permitted, to be situated between the first knuckle and second knuckle. One ring tattoo per hand remains authorized, but no tattoos are authorized on the thumbs. A single one-inch tattoo per hand is authorized on the hand between the wrist and the base of the finger. No tattoos are authorized on the palms, though.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to see the Coast Guard\u2019s new tattoo policy reinforces a professional appearance to the public while adopting some of the very same tattoo standards that are now acceptable among the public,\u201d notes Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard Jason Vanderhaden.\n\n\u201cThe new tattoo policy will expand our recruiting candidate pool and provide those already serving in the Coast Guard with a few new options.\u201d\n\nWEEKEND REAL ESTATE\n\nFor sale\u201d The Gloria Swanson Estate, a Renaissance Revival mansion built in 1926 on five acres near Englewood, New Jersey \u2014 and the residence of the iconic actress.
