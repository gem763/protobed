They Are Not a Cabal. They Are Public Servants. Let us now praise these not-silent heroes,\u201d Michelle Cottle, a member of the editorial board, wrote:\n\nPresident Trump is right: The deep state is alive and well. But it is not the sinister, antidemocratic cabal of his fever dreams. It is, rather, a collection of patriotic public servants \u2014 career diplomats, scientists, intelligence officers and others \u2014 who, from within the bowels of this corrupt and corrupting administration, have somehow remembered that their duty is to protect the interests, not of a particular leader, but of the American people.\n\nPraising the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who first went to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA)\u2019s committee before filing any formal complaint, Cottle said the unelected public servants protesting the president from within \u201cdeserve our gratitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout the Trump presidency, there has been a trickle of fed-up individuals willing to step up and protest the administration\u2019s war on science, expertise and facts,\u201d Cottle wrote.\n\nCottle, in her piece, pointed to three public servants who did not remain anonymous and actually quit their jobs, unlike the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d \u2014 Rod Schoonover, an analyst for the State Department; Joel Clement, former director of the Office of Policy Analysis at the Interior Department; and Lewis Ziska, a veteran plant physiologist with the Agriculture Department.\n\nCottle compared them to public servants at the State Department who have chosen to testify after House Democrats subpoenaed them as part of their impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nShe noted that White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney called them, \u201cmostly career bureaucrats who are saying, \u2018You know what, I don\u2019t like President Trump\u2019s politics, so I\u2019m going to participate in this witch hunt.\u2019\u201d\n\nCottle insisted that was not the case, and that instead, they are \u201cveteran public servants appalled by an administration that continues to subvert the public interest to the whims of a president who has mistaken himself for a king.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Mr. Trump\u2019s deep state. For the sake of the nation, the American public should be clamoring for more patriots to join the conspiracy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOn Tuesday, CNN reported that the anonymous senior Trump administration official who wrote the op-ed last year claiming to be part of the resistance is now planning to publish a book anonymously.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told CNN, \u201cTakes a lot of conviction and bravery to write a whole book anonymously.\u201d\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Liberals have scoffed at Trump's claim of a \"deep state\" undermining him, but the New York Times\u00a0 admitted the \"deep state is alive and well.\"", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/09/Trump-darkness-Deep-State.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
