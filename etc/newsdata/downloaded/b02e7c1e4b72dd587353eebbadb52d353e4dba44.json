Last week\u2019s rally, which pushed major U.S. stock indexes to the cusp of records, was led by shares of banks and small companies tied to the domestic economy. Those sectors have lagged behind in recent months but are staging one of their fastest rallies in years.\n\nAt the same time, Treasurys and gold, popular destinations for skittish investors, have taken a U-turn as fears have eased about a looming recession.\n\nDriving the reversal: hopes for coming trade talks with China and a spate of better-than-feared economic data. Figures from the past few weeks have shown steady retail sales and activity in the services sector, contained but stable inflation, and strength in the labor market. Although there are signs a manufacturing downturn overseas is spreading to the U.S., data tied to the consumer generally remain healthy.\n\nAnd because consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic output, some investors are hopeful more upbeat figures will drive stocks to new peaks\u2014the S&P 500 is up 20% for the year and within 0.6% of July\u2019s all-time high.\n\n\u201cEverything looks very attractive in the U.S.,\u201d said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities and multiasset strategies at Charles Schwab Investment Management, which is favoring U.S. stocks over international shares. \u201cConsumer spending continues to be very strong, so people are starting to get less worried.\u201d\n\nThe sudden market shift occurred after the U.S. and China softened rhetoric on trade and agreed to talks in Washington next month, highlighting how the trade war continues to hold markets hostage. A presidential tweet that takes a harsher tone could easily bring about another reversal.\n\nFor now, though, investors feel a thaw in the geopolitical air. About $14.4 billion flowed into global stock mutual and exchange-traded funds during the week that ended Wednesday, the largest such inflow since March 2018, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysis of data from fund tracker EPFR Global.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which is tied to everything from student debt to mortgages, staged its largest weekly climb since June 2013\u2014just days after approaching a record low. Yields, which rise as bond prices fall, had tumbled this summer as many investors flocked to safer investments. Gold prices, meanwhile, have dropped nearly 4% since hitting a six-year peak earlier in the month.\n\nThe pullback came as the S&P 500 rose for the third consecutive week, boosted by battered banks, manufacturers and commodity producers. For the week, Bank of America Corp. surged 8.8% and Caterpillar Inc. added 9%.\n\nAnd small companies that earn more of their revenue domestically outpaced major indexes by the largest margin since November 2016.\n\n\u201cThat reinforces the point that perhaps things aren\u2019t as bad as people feared,\u201d said Amanda Agati, chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services Group. \u201cWe think the market can forge ahead from here.\u201d\n\nMs. Agati said she was inundated with calls from nervous clients after the recent inversion of the yield curve, a measure of the gap between short- and long-term Treasury yields, but tried to keep them focused on areas of strength in the economy. Short-term yields have eclipsed longer-term ones before past recessions, though the time between such inversions and economic growth halting has varied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenging backdrop,\u201d Ms. Agati said. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky because you don\u2019t want to get too defensive too soon.\u201d\n\nFurther bolstering hopes for an improved growth outlook: The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S. recently turned positive for the first time since February, indicating data are generally coming in better than expected after downward revisions to growth targets in recent months. A similar measure for emerging markets has also rebounded. That gauge remains in negative territory, indicating figures are still broadly missing targets.\n\nTo some analysts, the perceived gap between domestic growth and economic activity globally is affirming the effect known as TINA: \u201cThere is No Alternative\u201d to U.S. stocks. Major indexes have long outpaced global equities and commodities, and a monthslong decline in bond yields has made dividends paid to shareholders look more appealing.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think growth in the U.S. will continue to outpace the rest of the world? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nInvestors this week will be monitoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest-rate decision and commentary amid hopes that lower borrowing costs will also support the economy. The central bank is expected to cut rates for the second time in three months, but some analysts say still steady growth calls into question bets on even more cuts ahead.\n\n\u201cThe risk of recession is still relatively tame,\u201d said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. \u201cIf earnings can stay anywhere near where they are, we think that\u2019s enough for the market to move higher.\u201d\n\nMr. Chiavarone is still overweight stocks, meaning he holds a larger position than the benchmark the firm tracks, and said he prefers shares of fast-growing companies in sectors like software and high dividend payers to stocks that are more economically sensitive.\n\nThe prospect of a sustained drop in corporate profits is one reason some investors are skeptical that stocks can continue climbing, particularly with more tariffs possibly on the horizon. The U.S. has proposed duties on a host of Chinese imports including smartphones and toys to take effect in December, potentially complicating plans for business spending and earnings projections.\n\nFedEx Corp. , General Mills Inc. and Adobe Inc. are among the notable companies reporting earnings this week.\n\n\u201cWe need to get some guidance from some of these companies, particularly these larger companies that are very multinational,\u201d said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors, which is holding elevated levels of cash and favoring value stocks that it considers cheaper. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect that volatility is over.\u201d\n\nWrite to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com", "description": "Investors are piling back into stocks and unwinding massive bets on haven assets, illustrating renewed faith that a resilient U.S. consumer can continue powering economic growth.", "authors": ["Amrith Ramkumar", "Amrith.Ramkumar Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106556/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
