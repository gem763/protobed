When you or the sign are removed, I will continue,\u201d Morrissey declared. \u201cOtherwise, get out. Now.\u201d\n\nHe went on to continually shout \u201cGo! Goodbye! We don\u2019t need you!\u201d until the man finally got up and exited the venue.\n\nFollowing the incident on Tuesday, Morrissey announced that he had canceled his performance in Seattle on Wednesday, but would return to his tour in San Francisco on Thursday.\n\n\u201cDue to circumstances beyond our control, Morrissey will not be able to perform tonight\u2019s concert scheduled in Seattle, Washington,\u201d read a statement on his promoter\u2019s website. \u201cRefunds will come from your point of purchase. The Morrissey/Interpol tour will resume as scheduled in San Francisco on Thursday.\u201d\n\nThe 60-year-old rocker upset many on the political left after declaring his support for the party, founded by the former leader of Sharia Watch and ex-Labour Party member Anne Marie Waters, with fellow artists and organizations even calling for a boycott on his music.\n\nHowever, Morrisey has refused to back down from his support of For Britain. Some of the party\u2019s policies include a massive reduction in Islamic immigration, immediate withdrawal from the European Union, and the introduction of a new British constitution.\n\n\u201cI despise racism. I despise fascism. I would do anything for my Muslim friends, and I know they would do anything for me,\u201d the singer explained last year. \u201cIn view of this, there is only one British political party that can safeguard our security. That party is For Britain.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Morrissey was forced to eject a protester from his concert in Portland on Tuesday after they held up a sign criticizing the rocker's support for the British anti-Islam party For Britain.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/11/Morrissey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
