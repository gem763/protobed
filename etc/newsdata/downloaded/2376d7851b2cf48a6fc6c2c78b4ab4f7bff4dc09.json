The metric -- which strips out the effect of currency swings and acquisitions -- has topped 4% for five straight quarters.\n\nPepsiCo posted $17.19 billion in net revenue for its fiscal third quarter ended Sept. 7, rising from $16.49 billion a year earlier on increases across all divisions. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting revenue of $16.93 billion.\n\nShares of PepsiCo rose 3% on Thursday.\n\nNet revenue at its North American beverage division -- the company's biggest contributor -- rose 3.4%. Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta said on the company's earnings call that recent investments in advertising have helped the division.\n\nMr. Laguarta said Gatorade logged sales growth in the mid-single digits in the quarter. PepsiCo has tried to bolster the sports-drink brand, including last year's launch of sugar-free Gatorade Zero, and Mr. Laguarta said that effort continues.\n\nPepsiCo earlier this year also rolled out three different flavors of Pepsi that are made with real juice.\n\nStrong results from potato-chip brands helped propel a 5.5% rise in sales for PepsiCo's Frito-Lay North America division.\n\n\"The business is not only growing but winning in the marketplace versus competition,\" Mr. Laguarta said of the snack division.\n\nPepsiCo's costs climbed as the company invested more in areas such as advertising and distribution. Selling, general and administrative costs rose more than 8% in the latest period.\n\nMr. Johnston said the investment in advertising spanned PepsiCo's different brands.\n\nHe said the company has also invested to add new lines at its manufacturing plants.\n\nNet income fell to $2.1 billion in the third quarter, from $2.5 billion a year earlier. The company's income-tax provision almost tripled, contributing to the drop in profit.\n\nPer share profit fell to $1.49 from $1.75. Adjusted earnings came to $1.56 a share, beating FactSet's analyst consensus estimate by 6 cents.\n\nWrite to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 04, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
