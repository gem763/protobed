Whether that\u2019s the chance to chill with Final Fantasy XV\u2019s Noctis or battle in Final Fantasy Tactics\u2019 Ivalice, there have been plenty of cool stories and difficult bosses. The latest challenge, a huge 24-player raid, adds a splash of Nier Automata and might be the best yet.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV features 24-player dungeons called \u201calliance raids\u201d that involve three groups of eight teaming up to defeat difficult bosses. These raids have included original stories about magical towers and air pirates, but they sometimes involve guest writers. The last raid series \u201cReturn to Ivalice\u201d had three different raids that brought in Final Fantasy Tactics\u2019 Yasumi Matsuno for a story using elements from Final Fantasy XII and Tactics. The newest raid series, added for the Shadbowbringers expansion, is called YoRHa:Dark Apocalypse and features Nier Automata director Yoko Taro and producer Yosuke Saito as guest creators.\n\nHow in the hell does Nier end up in Final Fantasy XIV? It just does. The story so far involves a pair of enterprising dwarfs who discover a factory underground. There they find 2P, not quite Nier Automata\u2019s protagonist 2B, and a facility creating killer robots. It\u2019s up to players to disable the facility and defeat a series of ever-increasing bosses. The current raid, \u201cThe Copied Factory,\u201d released yesterday, is among the highest level endgame activities in the game. It\u2019s also fast-paced, brimming with great music, and pushes players to their limits.\n\nNier\u2019s combat, either in the original game or Automata, is a mixture of action game fighting with bullet-time elements. The Copied Factory takes this idea and runs with it. Other raids involved gimmick mechanics, including doing maths on the fly and having a giant beam struggle with a demon. Dark Apocalypse focuses on dodging and quick thinking. It packs the screen with missiles to avoid, energy orbs to dance around, and robotic arms that instantly kill anyone they smash into.\n\nThe result is amazing. The Copied Factory demands player focus and punishes sloppy execution. Some players might find this frustrating \u2014 it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed by everything that\u2019s happening \u2014 but it provides a challenge that feels true to Nier Automata. It culminates in a final boss that I won\u2019t spoil here except to say the fight itself is one of the most intense battles in any game I\u2019ve played. Destroying tanks and hiding behind their wreckage to avoid explosions, withstanding carpet bombing and massive \u201ctankbusters\u201d that do tons of damage \u2014 every moment is perilous.\n\nThen there\u2019s the loot. Players eagerly awaiting a chance to cosplay as 2B or 9S will be pleased. The gear in the Copied Factory isn\u2019t just useful but captures some iconic looks. Better yet, players looking to gather the gear for fashion purposes can simply pass on picking gear with stats for a chance to receive a crate that automatically grants cosmetic only versions of gear sets. It\u2019s a fantastic new system that cuts down on gear farming and grinding.\n\nAll it took to get the full cosmetic set was one run of The Copied Factory and a successful dice roll on loot.\n\nDark Apocalypse is off to a great start, adding a fresh take on raids and better loot gathering. It\u2019s one of the best things Final Fantasy XIV has ever done, and there\u2019s still two more raids to go. Combined with the high quality, 8-player \u201cnormal raid\u201d collaboration with Final Fantasy VIII\u2019s Tetsuya Nomura, which was added in July, this latest expansion is knocking it out of the park with boss fights.", "description": "Final Fantasy XIV is no stranger to crossover events.
