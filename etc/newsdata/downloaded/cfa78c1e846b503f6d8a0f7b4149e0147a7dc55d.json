Russia and China share a 4,200-km (2,600-mile) border.\n\nBut Russia pivoted east after the West imposed sanctions on Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014 and trade ties with China have since expanded.\n\n\"Russia has special relations with China of advanced partnership.... including (on) the most sensitive (areas) linked to military-technical cooperation and security and defence capabilities,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry could not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment during the weeklong National Day holidays.\n\nLast year, Russia held its biggest military drills since the Soviet Union and invited China to take part, a move seen then as signalling closer military ties.
