Nonbinary people may want to avoid gendered pronouns like \"he\" and \"she\" or \"his\" and \"hers,\" as those pronouns might not capture how someone views themselves or wants to express themselves to others.\n\nGender-neutral \"they\" (and \"them\" and \"their\") provides one of many possible alternatives to gender-specific pronouns.\n\nA recent blog post on the Oxford English Dictionary's website pointed out that the singular \"they\" has long been used in the English language \u2014 tracing it back as far as a 14th-century romance \u2014 and that it wasn't until much later that grammarians started frowning upon using \"they\" to refer to one person.\n\nThis isn't the first time in recent years that Merriam-Webster has updated its definitions to be more inclusive of LGBTQ communities. As more US states legalized same-sex marriage, the dictionary updated its definition of \"marriage\" to reflect a more gender-neutral usage.", "description": "The singular \"they\" is a pronoun option for people who don't strongly identify as either male or female and want to avoid \"he\" and \"she.\"", "authors": ["Andy Kiersz"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8150842e22af5f141004a4-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
