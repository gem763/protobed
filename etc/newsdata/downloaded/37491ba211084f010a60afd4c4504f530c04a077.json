A vote on that proposed bill might then be held on Tuesday.\n\nIf the vote on the Brexit deal does go ahead later on Saturday, it is expected to be incredibly close, with the PM's former DUP allies and opposition parties planning to vote against the PM's deal.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would \"not be duped\" into voting for an agreement which would leave the UK worse off.\n\nHowever, at least nine Labour MPs are expected to support the government while the PM is hoping to be backed by some of the 21 Tory MPs he sacked for opposing him last month.\n\nSteve Baker, the chairman of the European Research Group, a group of Tory Brexiteers, recommended its members vote in favour of the deal at a meeting on Saturday morning.\n\nMr Johnson has defended the terms of of his revised EU withdrawal agreement at the start of the first weekend sitting since the invasion of the Falklands in 1982.\n\n'Heal rifts'\n\nHe urged MPs to come together to begin to \"heal the rifts in British politics\", saying he believed a majority of MPs were committed to delivering the result of the 2016 referendum.\n\nHe suggested any further negotiations would be fruitless and urged opponents of Brexit to \"abandon their delusion\" that another delay would help the UK.\n\n\"It is my judgement we have reached the best possible solution,\" he said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: \"Chance to move on\" with Brexit\n\n\"I must tell the House, in all candour, whatever letters they may seek to force the government to write, it cannot change my judgement that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\"\n\nAfter several hours of debate, there will be series of votes, not expected before 14.30 BST.\n\nAmong the amendments chosen by Speaker John Bercow to be voted on is a controversial one put down by former Tory Sir Oliver Letwin, who now sits as an independent.\n\nThis would withhold parliamentary support for the deal unless and until legislation implementing the agreement in UK law is passed by MPs.\n\nIf this amendment is passed, it would force the prime minister to seek a further delay to Brexit beyond the 31 October deadline - under the terms of the Benn Act passed last month.\n\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said its \"brutal effect\" would be to deny the PM the opportunity of having the \"conclusive\" vote on his deal he so badly wants.\n\nA No 10 source has said the vote on Mr Johnson's deal will be abandoned if the amendment is passed, saying it will \"render the entire day meaningless\".\n\n\"A vote for Letwin is a vote for delay and the whips will send everyone home,\" they said. \"It would perfectly sum up this broken Parliament.\"\n\nFormer Tory Chancellor Philip Hammond, who is backing the amendment, told the BBC it was an \"insurance policy\" to ensure the UK did not leave the EU later this month without a deal if the necessary legislation was not passed in time or was scuppered by MPs.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The prime minister and the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced the new deal at a summit on Thursday\n\nHe insisted he was not trying to stop Brexit and it might only lead to a delay to the UK's departure of a matter of weeks.\n\nMr Johnson has repeatedly said Brexit will happen by the end of the month with or without a deal.\n\nHis revised deal with the EU, secured at a Brussels summit on Thursday, ditches former PM Theresa May's backstop, the measure designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border.\n\nInstead it will, in effect, draw a new customs border along the Irish Sea.\n\nA number of Tory MPs who voted against Theresa May's agreement on all three occasions it was put to the Commons - the so-called \"Spartans\" - have said they will support the deal.\n\nThese include Mark Francois, the deputy chairman of the ERG of Tory Brexiteers, Iain Duncan Smith and Bernard Jenkin.\n\nAlso crucial to Mr Johnson's hopes of success will be the Tories who had the whip withdrawn for supporting a bill to force the PM to seek an extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\n'Sell-out'\n\nThe vast majority of Labour MPs will oppose the deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has branded a \"sell-out\" and worse than Theresa May's agreement rejected three times by MPs.\n\nThe government appears to have moved to allay concerns expressed by some Labour MPs by offering MPs wan enhanced role in determining the UK's future relationship with the EU and by announcing workers' rights and environmental standards will be boosted post-Brexit.\n\nIn response to a question from ex-business secretary Greg Clark, Mr Johnson said UK workers would not be short-changed after Brexit and he was prepared to guarantee in law that their rights would not lag behind those on the continent.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn said these were \"empty promises\".\n\n\"This government cannot be trusted and these benches will not be duped,\" he said.\n\n\"Supporting the government this afternoon will merely fire the starting pistol in a race to the bottom in regulations and standards.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionists have made clear they will not be voting for the deal, saying it would \"drive a coach and horses\" through the power-sharing arrangements enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe party's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said \"weariness\" over the Brexit process \"should not be an excuse for weakness on the union\".\n\n\"There may be special circumstances for Northern Ireland but that can only be with consent of the people - unionists and nationalists together. He must respect that.\"\n\nAnd the SNP's Ian Blackford said it would not support an agreement which would see Scotland \"shafted\" economically.\n\nAs the debate goes on, thousands of people are expected in central London, to call for a so-called People's Vote, asking for a new referendum on the Brexit deal.", "description": "Boris Johnson urges MPs to back his agreement with the EU, amid moves by MPs to delay approval of the deal until Brexit laws are passed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rhmcg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
