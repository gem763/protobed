She has seen people postpone their financial plans and refrain from saving for retirement because they don\u2019t want to deal with the possibly complicated equations and complex investing topics.\n\nA fear of math can be debilitating \u2014 and not just because it could result in poor math grades. Many students, especially girls, may avoid careers that include a heavy amount of math, especially those in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-gender-gap-starts-in-ninth-grade-2018-08-20 Girls made up just 30% of the top 5,000 ninth-graders in the American Mathematics Competitions, according to research distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2017. Just 18% of the top 500 ninth-graders were girls, and only 8% of the top 50. That gender gap worsens as they age \u2014 by senior year, only 22% of the top 5,000 are girls (compared with the 30% in ninth grade), followed by just 12% of the top 500.\n\nSee: 4 steps to conquering your fear of math\n\nParker, 30, taught Algebra II and geometry to high-school students before switching to financial planning and working with her 76-year-old father, who has his own firm. She also became a Certified Financial Planner. \u201cI have a math background and the CFP puts me in a good position to do financial planning in a way that educates people about the planning and why,\u201d she said. Their age difference also helps them work with clients of all ages and provide their own perspectives, she added.\n\nParker spoke with MarketWatch about her education background, why people are so worried about math and how to mesh the two:\n\nMarketWatch: How exactly would you describe math anxiety?\n\nMaddie Parker: A lot of people would say \u201cI have that\u201d and to a degree, a lot of people do, but it\u2019s more than feeling like you don\u2019t do well on exams. Kids who have math anxiety almost always have a physical inability to respond to being tested or asked to perform on math-related tasks. It is just built up over the years of different experiences, and it stops them from being able to learn any further.\n\nMW: Is it something adults face?\n\nParker: It translates from kids to adulthood. When you get out of school, you\u2019re less exposed or have less experience being tested so the anxiety may seem like it\u2019s gone away but any time math or that skill is required, the anxiety comes right back. I think it has been perpetuated as a weird acceptance in our country, that it\u2019s OK to be bad at math. Like, \u201coh, math is hard and it\u2019s OK not to get it.\u201d It definitely follows into adulthood and affects people dealing with finances, because they have to do math and they don\u2019t know how to do it, and they\u2019re stressed or embarrassed to ask for help.\n\nMW: How can math anxiety impact personal finances?\n\nParker: In high school, you\u2019re not required to take personal finance and the math you\u2019re doing is unrelated to what you do in real life. And that real life math in your brain is still tied to calculus so you think, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that at 16, I probably can\u2019t handle finances now.\u201d But it is different math. It\u2019s not to say it\u2019s simple, but it\u2019s different, and it is applicable in such a way that people do find it easier to understand. It is not quite as challenging as graphing logarithmic equations. It\u2019s a lot different.\n\nMW: There are many people who say women generally are more likely to have math anxiety than men. Is that something you\u2019ve seen?\n\nParker: There are great articles and podcasts and TED talks about the same concepts, of how we\u2019re raising our girls to be perfect and raising our boys to be brave. And there was one example at a girls\u2019 coding camp, where they have to learn to do coding and the girls specifically would type up all this stuff and then if they couldn\u2019t figure it out they\u2019d erase it all and call the teacher over. The teacher would press undo and show all of this work and that they were really close, but because the girls couldn\u2019t make it work they wanted to tell the teacher to show them from the beginning. They didn\u2019t want to show this not perfect work.\n\nIt is just a good example that demonstrates that girls are being raised to be perfect and not in the same way as boys, who may say (like in that example) that they don\u2019t care and at least they\u2019ll get partial credit. The only way to learn is by making mistakes, but that gets lost on girls when they feel they have to be perfect.\n\nMW: Does that concept translate to adult couples in financial planning?\n\nParker: It is more apparent for women when they are single individuals. They\u2019re more comfortable saying \u201cI don\u2019t get it\u201d or it\u2019s more evident. They\u2019re not as afraid to ask for help. It\u2019s when they\u2019re with their spouses it is easier to be quiet or let them talk and pretend you understand things because your partner is helping you, but it is still relevant. I always work with most clients together and I will ask them both \u201cdo you understand this?\u201d or make sure they\u2019re both on the same page.\n\nAlso see: \u2018Math isn\u2019t so hard for women post backfires for financial planning organization\n\nMW: How would you say your background as a math teacher benefits you and your clients?\n\nParker: One of the biggest ways is in my ability to explain things. It\u2019s funny, I majored in math and decided to be a high school math teacher, but when I was in high school, I struggled with math. I had good grades and I didn\u2019t have math anxiety, but I wasn\u2019t some freaky Einstein genius kid who got it all. It made sense when I didn\u2019t get something right and because I liked it so much I worked hard to understand it. I was good at explaining things to my friends. But my own struggle made me good at explaining it. A lot of math teachers are geniuses who understand it, and that makes it hard to explain it to students who are struggling.\n\nThat ability translates nicely to doing financial plans. I can see what is probably going to confuse them and where they\u2019ll get lost.\n\nMW: Are there any math-related topics that clients typically have a hard time understanding?\n\nParker: It varies, but one big thing we talk about is inflation and compound interest. The need to factor in inflation because a dollar today is not going to be a dollar 10 years from now, and that it is a slow climb. People are amazed at how different the numbers look when I factor in 2.5% inflation.\n\nMW: Is there any way to overcome math anxiety?\n\nParker: It is important that there be no stigma about it. There\u2019s this expectation people have of themselves that they should know more about finance because it applies to their life. I am a financial adviser and I don\u2019t know how to fix my car, so I bring it to be serviced by professionals. I don\u2019t feel stupid because I didn\u2019t focus on that and I know nothing about it.\n\nIt can be scary if you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re going to and unfortunately there are some bad people out there, but if you do your homework to find the people to help you, you don\u2019t need to feel ashamed or embarrassed. That\u2019s the whole reason you find a professional to begin with \u2014 someone who is trained. That\u2019s their job.", "description": "This teacher-turned-financial adviser on the different ways men and women approach math and life", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT944_maddie_MG_20191024114515.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
