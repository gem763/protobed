In Illinois, a reader participated in a debate on slavery in which the pro-slavery side won. And a fourth-grade class in Virginia was given an assignment that referred to enslaved people as \u201cAfrican workers.\u201d\n\nInspired by Nikita Stewart\u2019s essay for The 1619 Project on why slavery is taught so poorly in American schools, we asked readers to tell us about their own experiences learning this history. We received hundreds of responses depicting off-base and factually inconsistent lessons, as well as a few thoughtful approaches.\n\nBelow is a selection, condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nThe \u2018Good\u2019 Aspects of Slavery\n\nIn a Virginia history textbook from the 1960s, enslaved people are shown \u201cenjoying themselves\u201d after a day of forced labor.\n\nMany readers remembered lessons that emphasized the \u201cpleasant\u201d aspects of slavery, an attempt to play down its horrors that some rejected even as children.\n\nIn the fifth grade, my textbook said that many enslaved people were \u201csad\u201d that slavery ended, because their enslavers took care of them and gave them food and clothing. I took the book home, and my parents made me go back to school and tell my teacher to change the book and teach us the truth \u2014 my parents said \u201cjustice demanded it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kian Glenn, 32, went to school in Eden Prairie, Minn.\n\nIn my 10th grade American history class, we were given an assignment to write the \u201cpros\u201d and cons of slavery. Many of us questioned what, if any, \u201cpro\u201d would there be, but the assignment stood.\n\n\u2014 Deirdre Sheridan, 24, went to school in Scotch Plains, N.J.\n\nWe were taught that removing people from Africa and bringing them to America \u201csaved\u201d them from idolatry and damnation. We were also taught that slavery was a \u201ckindly\u201d institution and that enslavers \u201cloved\u201d their enslaved people and took good care of them.\n\n\u2014 Karen Seay, 72, went to school in Inman, S.C.\n\nIn grade nine or 10, we took Alabama History. The teacher told us that \u201cslavery wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d Then the teacher asked, \u201cWould you treat something badly that you had paid good money for?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reginald Grayson, 53, went to school in Huntsville, Ala.\n\nInaccuracies About the Cause of the Civil War\n\nEven though historians have concluded that slavery was central to the Civil War, many readers told us that their teachers told them otherwise.\n\nIn seventh grade, my teacher announced that \u201cthe Civil War had absolutely nothing to do with slavery!\u201d while standing in the middle of the classroom and sweeping her arm in the air dramatically.\n\n\u2014 Angela Aguero, 59, went to school in Chelsea, Mass.\n\nIn eighth grade, we debunked the \u201cmyth\u201d that slavery caused the Civil War. Instead, we learned, the Southern states felt as though their rights were being encroached on by the Northern states, and thus \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d actually led to the breaking up of the Union.\n\n\u2014 Daniel Tran, 20, went to school in Windham, N.H.\n\nMy high school history teacher was a strict economic determinist \u2014 all wars are fought for economic reasons, whether or not those reasons were actual or merely perceived was moot to him. To him, slavery was not a cause of the war, except to the extent that it threatened the economic interests of landed Southerners.\n\n\u2014 John Beauregard, 79, went to school in Windsor, Conn.\n\nPoorly Constructed Demonstrations\n\nA reader, Hannah Lang, said her younger sister was given a worksheet to complete in class that referred to enslaved people as \u201cAfrican workers\u201d and emphasized a \u201cneed\u201d for slave labor. Handout/Hannah Lang\n\nReaders told us about lessons that missed the mark by providing little context for what students should be learning \u2014 or, worse, that seemed to minimize the evils of slavery.\n\nIn the fifth or sixth grade, several students were designated as judges. The rest of the class was divided into two groups \u2014 one pro-slavery and the other against \u2014 and asked to give arguments in front of the judges about whether slavery should be outlawed.\n\nI was on the antislavery side, so I got up and talked to the class about families being torn apart and babies ripped out of mothers\u2019 arms. I remember this activity so clearly because I thought we had the easier argument and we should have won by default.\n\nI was shocked when the judges voted against us.\n\n\u2014 Jane Zhi, 33, went to school in Hoffman Estates, Ill.\n\nIn the eighth grade, my teacher turned off the lights, gathered the desks in the middle of the room and made all the students sit in the fetal position under them. She then played a music track with crashing waves and spooky thunderbolts. She told us that this is what the Middle Passage was like for enslaved persons.\n\nAt the time, I thought the activity was dumb, boring and pointless.\n\nThe lesson was so superficial that it was probably a mockery of real horrors and hardship. Also, it probably wasn\u2019t an appropriate way to communicate the material to us, and the emulation of the pain could have been triggering for some.\n\n\u2014 Mark Anliker, 25, went to school in Zionsville, Ind.\n\nOne day, I was looking at a work sheet my little sister brought home from school from the fourth grade. Two questions in particular caught my eye. One was \u201cIn what region did the African workers primarily settle?\u201d\n\nAnd another was \u201cWhy did the Virginia colony need African slave labor?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe the work sheet referred to enslaved people as \u201cAfrican workers,\u201d as though it was voluntary. I also couldn\u2019t believe it said Virginia needed slave labor.\n\n\u2014 Hannah Lang, 23, Leesburg, Va.\n\nIn the fifth grade, I was one of three black girls in the class, and all three of us were assigned to be \u201cslaves\u201d during a presentation. I told my teacher that I was too nervous to give the presentation, and he told me to add that into the role playing.\n\nHe said if my voice shakes or cracks, I can say I sound like that because \u201cmassa will beat me or sell me if he knewed I was talkin\u2019 to y\u2019alls.\u201d It was very humiliating, and I felt horrible afterward.\n\n\u2014 Mary Watts, 29, went to school in Orlando, Fla.\n\nA Missing Education\n\nSome told us that lessons on slavery were rushed, severely lacking or missing entirely.\n\nI didn\u2019t learn about slavery until high school. It was a short paragraph within a chapter about the Civil War in our history textbook. Although I already knew about slavery, it took me literal years to understand the scope, long-term ramifications and all-encompassing reach of slavery \u2014 and I\u2019m still learning today.\n\n\u2014 Margaret Browne, 33, went to school in North Kingstown, R.I.\n\nI was one of the few African-American students at my high school in Southern Virginia. While taking Advanced Placement U.S. History, I noted that our book only had about one and a half pages on slavery, which included the half-page diagram of a slave ship.\n\n\u2014 Brian M. Williams, 39, went to school in Botetourte County, Va.\n\nThere was minimal discussion about slavery at my school, but in our Texas history class, a teacher joked, \u201cIf the South won, you would be our slaves.\u201d I was one of four black students and we looked at one another in shock. The teacher became angry and said it was \u201cjust a joke.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Gina Kennedy, 46, went to school in Dallas\n\nI don\u2019t remember being taught anything other than the main facts: when it started, what crops benefited and other significant historical events. My Advanced Placement U.S. History teacher zoomed through it all.\n\n\u2014 Poppy Purcell, 44, went to school in Redondo Beach, Calif.\n\nWell-Handled Lessons\n\nA reader praised a lesson comparing Howard Zinn\u2019s \u201cA People\u2019s History of the United States\u201d to her school district\u2019s textbook.\n\nNot all readers felt that their education was lacking. Some told us they received memorable and robust lessons on slavery that encouraged them to think deeply about the atrocities faced by enslaved people and also about how that history is reflected in modern society.\n\nIn seventh grade, my history teacher had us compare the district textbook with \u201cA People\u2019s History of the United States\u201d by Howard Zinn. A moment that stands out the most was when we discussed the semantic difference between the phrases \u201cthey were given freedom\u201d and \u201cthey took their freedom.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion of the lesson was that \u201cto take\u201d implies that one is retrieving what has been stolen and is a phrase of power, whereas \u201cto give\u201d implies that freedom is not an inherent trait but rather a state to be bestowed by a benefactor. Once I saw this language, I couldn\u2019t unsee it.\n\n\u2014 Kristen N., 41, went to school in Santa Rosa, Calif.\n\nI had an excellent, but unorthodox, U.S. History teacher. During one discussion, he said this: Enslavers loved enslaved people \u201clike they loved their dogs.\u201d\n\nDuring that time, I think it was common for people to believe the adage: Enslavers \u201cloved their slaves.\u201d\n\nI believe a student brought this up in discussion. Mr. Hall\u2019s comment told us that \u201clove\u201d might mean something very different than appreciation. This realization was profound to me.\n\nI came to see that it could be love of property, love of economic advantage, love of defining and \u201cbeing superior,\u201d love of degrading people.\n\n\u2014 Suzanne Zintel, 76, went to school in Ridgewood, N.J.\n\nI always thought the way I was taught about slavery was standard, which is why I\u2019m always surprised to see headlines saying that most Americans don\u2019t know the full story of slavery.\n\nWe learned about how different countries addressed slavery and eventually outlawed it. We learned about the participation of slaves and freed men in the Civil War and in the numerous revolts that occurred before.\n\nOur textbooks were supplemented by field trips to plantations that showed slave quarters, and we watched movies to help understand the subject. We also read the writings of Frederick Douglass and learned about other enslaved people who sued for their freedom.\n\nI went to a Catholic school that was open and intent on teaching us the failures of the Catholic Church throughout history, including slavery.\n\n\u2014 Gabriela W., 27, went to school in Irving, Tex.", "description": "We asked you how you learned about slavery in school. You told us about degrading role play, flawed lessons and teachers who played down its horrors.", "authors": ["Nicole Phillip", "Compiled Nicole Phillip"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/magazine/27mag-UGCEducation/27mag-UGCEducation-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
