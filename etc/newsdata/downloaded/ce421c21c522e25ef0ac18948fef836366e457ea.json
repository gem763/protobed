Some have proved so popular they\u2019ve been worn whatever the weather.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The sole is really tough without being overly heavy, and is lined with aluminium, to help keep the cold out. The boots are lined with synthetic fur \u2013 but not too much so they\u2019re not too thick. There\u2019s a pull cord round the top to further keep the cold and wet at bay, and they\u2019re a decent mid height. Most pleasing to our young tester is the LED light in the heel that blinks on every step. These will last and last, as is the company\u2019s ethos for them. Available in black too.\n\nBuy now\n\nCrocs kids\u2019 handle it rain boot: \u00a319.99, Crocs\n\nBased on the same design as the classic Crocs shoes, these rain boots are wonderfully simple but comfortable with good support. They are the only pair here to not be lined, they\u2019re extremely light and have a roomy fit. Huge grab handles make them easy to tug on, and the soles are grippy and firm. There\u2019s a reflective Crocs logo on the heel. They\u2019re also available in green, pale pink, bright pink, bright blue and pale blue.\n\nBuy now\n\nFrugi puddle buster wellington boots: \u00a324, Frugi\n\nFrugi comes up trumps again with its cute designs \u2013 these puddle busters are available in gender-neutral polar bears and igloos, cars and lorries, or rhino prints, and are so cheerful. Made from natural rubber and lined with cotton, they\u2019ll keep mild chills at bay but cold days may require an extra pair of socks. The soles have enough flexibility for lots of running and playing, but are dense enough to not feel every little pebble or bump through.\n\nBuy now\n\nGrass & Air kids colour-revealing wellies: \u00a318, Beyond the Stork\n\nWe love the fun idea of these wellies, where the raindrops change from white to multicoloured when they get wet, a feature that hasn\u2019t failed to entertain our tester every time they\u2019ve been worn in the rain. Lined with cosy brushed fleece, they\u2019re warm without being overly bulky, and are robust yet relatively lightweight. Another nice touch, encouraging kids to learn their left and right, is the illustration on the insoles that joins up when you put the boots side by side. Available in coral, green, yellow, pink and navy.\n\nBuy now\n\nHunter original kids first Peppa Pig grab handle wellington boots: \u00a340, Hunter\n\nThis Hunter x Peppa Pig collaboration has been a huge hit with our little tester, often wanting to wear them on even the sunniest of days. A pared back design disguises the sturdy build; the soles are surprisingly grippy despite appearances. The grab handles make these a cinch to pull on and the cotton lining is soft to the touch. Made from natural vulcanised rubber, these boots are very flexible and light. The Peppa Pig collaboration is limited edition, but you can get the same classic grab handle boot withour the print for \u00a335. Also available in pink and blue.\n\nBuy now\n\nJoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9 kids ankle wellies: \u00a317, JoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9\n\nA shorter height than most, these ankle wellies are ideal for showers on warmer days or for playing on the beach. Made from natural rubber, they\u2019re flexible, durable and have an anti-sweat cotton liner. Lighter than full-length pairs, they\u2019re comfy to wear all day and have a ridged, grippy sole. They\u2019re vegan friendly \u2013 the glue is a synthetic bond. Available in navy or fuchsia.\n\nBuy now\n\nJoules roll up wellies grey floral: \u00a324.95, Joules\n\nTaller than the majority of wellington boots included here, these pretty puddle stompers from Joules are designed to be rolled down and folded up, so they\u2019re easier to carry about and have to hand if unexpectedly needed. It seems a bit of an unnecessary gimmick, as all the boots featured here will fold up, but these at least do so the easiest (NB don\u2019t store them rolled up). Despite the tall design, these are one of the lightest pairs we tested and our tester found them to to be wonderfully comfy. Lined with thin cotton, they\u2019re another pair to feature a reflective strip down the back. Also available in antique gold, khaki camo, dark blue dinos, navy stripes and navy sharks.\n\nBuy now\n\nMuddy Puddles puddlestomper wellies raindrop print: \u00a324.50, Muddy Puddles\n\nThe tallest boots reviewed here, the puddlestompers from Muddy Puddles have long been a best-seller. This year, the design has been tweaked \u2013 there\u2019s now a reflective strip on the back for improved visibility, and soft padded insoles have been added. They\u2019re hardwearing and comfortable, and have a soft cotton lining. Unlike the rest featured here, they have a small heel \u2013 but our tester didn\u2019t notice any difference. Also available in a yellow sea urchin design.\n\nBuy now\n\nPolarn O.Pyret stripe wellies: \u00a328, Polarn O.Pyret\n\nA chunky sole make these PO.P wellies a reliable choice, and the distinctive stripes are complemented with a reflective strip down the back. The PVC-free rubber outer is lined with cotton, and the insole is also cotton and can be taken out and washed separately. There are little pull tabs at the rear to encourage children to put them on themselves, but our tester found them too small and fiddly to use, and would just wriggle them on like any other. Also available in navy.\n\nBuy now\n\nRNLI kids yellow welly: \u00a315, RNLI\n\nIdeal for budding lifeboat volunteers, these RNLI wellies are just like the ones the grown ups wear at sea. Strong and dependable, these rubber wellies have a thin cotton liner and a comfy sole. Great for the beach, they\u2019re lightweight and straightforward, and all proceeds go to supporting the RNLI\u2019s work. Also available in navy with red logo.\n\nBuy now\n\nSolognac glenarm warm kids low hunting wellies black: \u00a312.99, Decathlon\n\nFantastic value, these wellies have a warm fleece lining that can be removed if necessary \u2013 to easily wash, for example. They\u2019re not as exciting as some of the other designs here but they\u2019re very functional, lightweight and non-slip, as you\u2019d expect from Solognac\u2019s parent brand Decathlon. The little pull-tab at the back of the boot is attached to the inner sock, so tugging them on kept everything in place. For the price, they\u2019re hard to beat.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Kids wellies\n\nTop marks go to the Reima twinkle wellies \u2013 exceptionally well designed and made, they will last and last, and the flashing lights in the heels gave them the winning vote from our young tester. Also commended are the Grass & Air colour-revealing ones, for their fun design, and the great value Solognacs from Decathlon.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
