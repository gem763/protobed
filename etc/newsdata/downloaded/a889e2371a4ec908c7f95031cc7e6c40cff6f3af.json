Sham was assaulted by four to five men Wednesday while on his way to a meeting in nearby Mong Kok -- the second time he\u2019s been attacked since August.\n\n\u201cWhen Jimmy was at his street counter, many of the citizens expressed that they really hope there will be a safe march on Sunday,\u201d the Civil Human Rights Front said in a statement Thursday. \u201cJimmy therefore urges the Police to issue Letter of No Objection, so that Hongkongers can express their views.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Human Rights Front has helped organize several of the largest protests ever held in the former British colony, including two largely peaceful marches in June that drew more than a million people. The demonstrations have since mushroomed into a broader push for greater democracy, leading to regular clashes between protesters and police and occasional incidents of mob violence.\n\nOn Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, was forced to repeatedly halt a question session in the city\u2019s legislature as opposition lawmakers demanded her to step down and address other protester demands. The coming weekend will be the Asian financial center\u2019s 20th-straight weekend of unrest.\n\nSee also: Hong Kong Police Targeted With Remote-Controlled Explosive\n\nNg Tak-nam, chief police inspector for the Mong Kok area, condemned the attack on Sham, which he said appeared to have been premeditated. \u201cThe police will investigate impartially and seriously, regardless of the person\u2019s background and identity,\u201d Ng told reporters.\n\nSham, who is planning to join the district council elections next month, was attacked in August by two masked men with a baseball bat and knife. Police have arrested three men in connection with that earlier case, charging two of them with conspiracy to assault causing bodily harm. The third is on bail pending further investigation.\n\nThe Civil Human Rights Front said that the assailants in the latest attack appeared to be aiming for Sham\u2019s head, elbows and knees. The group said he suffered several wounds, but had no broken bones.\n\n\u201cThe Civil Human Rights Front strongly condemns the acts of the perpetrators,\u201d the group said. \u201cIt is not hard to link this incident to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights.\u201d\n\n(Updates with recovery in headline and first paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Justin Chin.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Shelly Banjo in Hong Kong at sbanjo@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Ben Sharples\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- One of Hong Kong\u2019s most prominent protest organizers -- including a march planned for Sunday -- was recovering after being attacked on the street by men wielding hammers.Jimmy Sham -- convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized many of the city\u2019s largest peaceful protests", "authors": ["Shelly Banjo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k9oV8RjQ6P8NNeTNKOUB2g--~B/aD0xMjM4O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/398e32d59f7e52f577ebb9051228b303", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
