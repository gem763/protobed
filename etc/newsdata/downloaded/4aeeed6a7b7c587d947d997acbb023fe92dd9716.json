The Supreme Court ruling Wednesday only ends a nationwide block on the policy ordered by a lower court.\n\nUnder the new rule, which the Trump administration published in July, migrants who pass through another country must seek asylum there rather than at the U.S. border, where they are ineligible to do so. The policy effectively cuts off the chance to win asylum for immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras\u2014who are the vast majority of people crossing the border.\n\nA Homeland Security official said newly arriving migrants are subject to a process known as \u201cexpedited removal,\u201d under which migrants can be deported without a court hearing, but would-be asylum seekers can still ask for an interview with an asylum officer and even ask for a judge to hear their cases.\n\nEven if they are denied asylum, migrants can also ask for other protections if they fear returning to their home nations. Under U.S. law, they can also apply for a more limited status allowing them to remain in the U.S. and work, though that option can never lead to permanent residence, and it requires meeting a higher threshold of proof that an immigrant faces persecution at home.\n\nSome immigrant advocates and lawyers say that, to be considered for this temporary status, immigrants must know to ask for it specifically; most currently don\u2019t.\n\nRandy Capps, director of research at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said the new rule and swift deportations of ineligible asylum seekers would deter many more people in Central America from attempting to make the journey north.\n\n\u201cPurely from an enforcement point of view, if you deport people back to their home countries quickly, that will have a big impact because people in their home communities will say, \u2018Oh, it didn\u2019t work, they didn\u2019t get in,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nDHS may face practical hurdles in trying to detain and quickly deport thousands of newly arriving migrants: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an enforcement arm of DHS, has long said it doesn\u2019t have enough jail space to house safely migrants waiting for deportation.\n\nIn Texas and New Mexico, where a federal circuit court allowed the policy to take effect several weeks ago, immigrants have been permitted to apply for asylum, a process that could stretch weeks or even months. If the Trump administration allows this practice to continue across the entire border, as a DHS official suggested is the case, these immigrants could be permitted to stay in the U.S. to attend hearings, adding to an immigration court backlog, though their cases would be largely predetermined.\n\nThe administration has argued that the U.S. asylum process has motivated the surge of migrants from Central America this year. Immigrants traveling as families, who make up most of the people crossing the border, can\u2019t be detained for longer than 20 days, and they are most often permitted to remain and work in the U.S. for years as they await decisions on their asylum cases.\n\nThe government argues that most of their cases are meritless or even fraudulent, and that immigrants truly fleeing persecution would seek a haven in the first country they enter.\n\n\u201cEvidence clearly suggests that the surge of Central American migrants was not driven by worsening conditions in the region, but rather the near certainty of admission into the United States due to loopholes in our asylum system,\u201d said RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates lowering all forms of immigration.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do you think of the Trump administration\u2019s asylum policy? Join the conversation below.\n\nU.S. asylum law generally allows people to request asylum when they arrive in the U.S., with some exceptions, including those coming through a country deemed safe pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement. The U.S. currently has only one such pact, known as a safe-third-country agreement, and that is with Canada. The Trump administration is in negotiations to put a similar pact in place with Guatemala.\n\nImmigrant-rights advocates say that, no matter how the new U.S. asylum rule is implemented, it will result in immigrants who have valid claims to asylum never being allowed to make a case.\n\n\u201cPeople whose lives are in danger will be deported without getting a hearing before a judge,\u201d said Charanya Krishnaswami, advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA.\n\nImmigration-rights advocates say that the countries those immigrants must cross to reach the U.S.\u2014 Mexico and Guatemala\u2014have only nascent asylum systems. Mexico agreed to build up its asylum capacity in a June agreement with the United States, but Guatemala, where the U.S. State Department counsels American citizens to take extreme precautions before traveling, received fewer than 300 asylum applications in 2018.\n\nThe administration this year has enacted other policies that the new rule would appear to render unnecessary. For example, the government has been sending many asylum seekers since December to wait for their court proceedings in Mexico, under a policy known as Remain in Mexico. DHS opened the first of several courts it erected specifically to hear Remain in Mexico cases on Wednesday.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear that the government would continue to send migrants to wait in Mexico if it could quickly deport them instead.\n\nWrite to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com and Alicia A.
