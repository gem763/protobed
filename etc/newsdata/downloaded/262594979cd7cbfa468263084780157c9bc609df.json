Here's how make sure it's a success", "language": "en", "text": "With U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-in set to hold a summit in New York on Monday\u2014as talk builds that a third U.S.-North Korea summit is possible by the end of the year\u2014we once again have a historic opportunity to usher in lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nConfused yet? I know I sure am\u2014and I do this for a living.\n\nConsidering the fact that North Korea has been testing missiles at a furious pace over the last few months while making some very bold statements to match, tensions seemed to be spiking all over again.\n\nNORTH KOREA\u2019S KIM INVITES TRUMP TO PYONGYANG IN LETTER: REPORT\n\nBut with President Trump\u2019s recent decision to part ways with now-former National Security Adviser John Bolton\u2014someone many senior Blue House and White House officials blame for the collapse of the Hanoi summit\u2014along with recent comments that he has rejected Bolton\u2019s suggestion that the \u201cLibya model\u201d be used to denuclearize North Korea, it seems Washington is ready to try and strike a bargain.\n\nPyongyang also seems willing to deal. North Korean state media in a recent article stated that upcoming working-level talks\u2014now proposed for the end of this month\u2014are part of a \"process to discuss and fine-tune the content to be included in an agreement to be signed at a summit\u201d.\n\nWith that said, now is the time to consider what it will take to get a deal across the finish line. History tells us that won\u2019t be easy\u2014the recent Singapore and Hanoi summits prove that all the fancy photos and made-for-TV moments won\u2019t bring peace to the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe good news is that if he plays his diplomatic cards right, President Trump can make history, securing a deal whereby Pyongyang begins the process of dismantling its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a partial roll-back of sanctions relief.\n\nBelow are four simple steps to not only securing a deal and getting to a summit but what it will take to get to the bargaining table in the first place and how talks could fall apart.\n\nLe'ts Get Working Level Talks Going\u2014Now\n\nSure, that seems like the easy part\u2014but the simple act of getting negotiators together has been tough. Even after President Trump taking the historic step\u2014literally\u2014of walking into North Korea back in June, there has been no progress on working-level meetings that would set the stage for at least an interim deal and a possible third Kim-Trump summit.\n\nBut having a meeting for meeting's sake only invites disaster. To ensure such talks are productive, both sides need to communicate clearly the agenda they hope to pursue, what both sides want to accomplish and at least a rough idea of each sides bottom lines are.\n\nAbove all, there is one thing American negotiators must know going into the talks: that their North Korean counterparts have the authority to talk and make a deal on Kim\u2019s nuclear weapons and facilities, something Pyongyang\u2019s working-level team did not have when they met with their U.S. counterparts in negotiations leading up to the Hanoi summit. Sadly, Kim would only negotiate on nuclear weapons directly with Trump, with his negotiators in Hanoi claiming he was bringing a \u201cbig gift\u201d. We all know the result\u2014a historic failure.\n\nHere's What a Deal Should Look Like\n\nSo, let\u2019s assume working-level talks due proceed. What would a deal look like?\n\nTo be frank, at least to me, the specifics seem clear: liaison offices to expedite communications between America and North Korea, some sort of peace declaration ending the Korean War, a sustained joint effort to uncover all Korean War remains and some sort of first step that shows Kim\u2019s commitment to denuclearization with America making security guarantees along with some sort of easing of sanctions.\n\nNukes for Sanctions Relief Is Critical\n\nIt\u2019s that last part that seems to be the sticking point. The lynchpin in any deal is how much of a down payment does Kim want to make on getting rid of his nuclear weapons and how much does Trump ultimately want to pay for it?\n\nAt least for me, there is a formula that makes sense. Kim would put down on paper\u2014no longer just a pledge to Trump\u2014that he will no longer test intermediate-range or long-range missiles (ICBMs) as well as nuclear weapons. Kim would also agree to the full closure of the Yongbyon nuclear facility, the crown jewel of North Korea\u2019s nuclear efforts as well as international inspectors on the ground to verify it.\n\nWhat America should offer is to rollback for 24 months\u2014not eliminate permanently\u2014sanctions on North Korea\u2019s exports of coal, textiles along with the removal of restrictions on fuel imports.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWashington would also agree to the resumption of several billion dollars\u2019 worth of inter-Korean economic projects in close coordination with South Korea, again, for a 24-month period. This would allow the Trump administration to test North Korea\u2019s intentions and snap back sanctions in 24 months if Pyongyang were to cheat in any way\u2014or even sooner if needed.\n\nThe Key: Both Sides Shouldn\u2019t Overreach\n\nThere will, of course, be those who will demand way more\u2014on both sides.\n\nSome in North Korea will surely demand more sanctions relief. There will be those in America who will demand a full accounting of North Korea\u2019s nuclear assets, missiles, and halting of any nuclear weapons production. Such demands will only poison the well, leading to another long-pause in diplomatic efforts or something far worse. Both sides need to start with smaller steps that can build trust and lead to bigger efforts in the future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut if any of this is going to work, both sides need to start talking\u2014and soon. If Washington and Pyongyang come to the table with realistic expectations with an eye towards rebooting their relationship over the long-term, we could see some history get made in the next few months.\n\nThat\u2019s the only path to a third U.S.-North Korea summit.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM HARRY KAZIANIS", "description": "We once again have a historic opportunity to usher in lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.", "authors": ["Harry J.
