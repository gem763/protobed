Now he says it might happen again.", "language": "en", "text": "Mark Cabana was warning of the emerging strains in short-term U.S. money markets as early as last year, well before daily funding markets seized up last month and forced the Federal Reserve to dust off tools it hadn\u2019t used since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn the end, the troubles in the repo market, a roughly $2 trillion short-term lending market that is vital to financing on Wall Street, comes down to how the U.S. central bank briefly lost its grip on its policy interest rate in September, said the head of U.S. short rates strategy for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in an interview with MarketWatch on Monday.\n\nCabana said the central bank has been working hard to avoid further funding stresses, but believes the Fed could do more to help assuage the frayed nerves of market participants after September\u2019s repo market crisis when overnight lending rates surged to a peak of 10%, according to some estimates.\n\nSee: Here are 5 things to know about the recent repo market operations\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the crux. We are talking about the core of central banking. There were a couple of days when the Fed lost control, and they have now taken steps to regain that,\u201d said Cabana, who worked at the New York Fed\u2019s markets group for more than eight years from 2007 to 2015.\n\nSo when the repo market \u2014 used by banks and hedge funds to borrow short-term funds to finance their trading positions \u2014 saw rates surge to five times their normal levels in mid-September, it briefly rattled Wall Street, reviving memories of the 2008 crisis when funding markets similarly seized up.\n\nThe demand for cash also dragged the rate to borrow from the fed-funds market above the central bank\u2019s preferred levels as both repo and fed funds are pools of short-term funding.\n\nBNP Paribas\n\nTo keep interest rates within their targeted range, the U.S. central bank launched repo auctions, temporarily lending cash in return for Treasurys and government-backed mortgage bonds, for the first time in more than a decade to inject liquidity back into funding markets.\n\nMore important, it reversed gears on its plans to shrink the size of the crisis-era balance sheet, which analysts say was one of the biggest reasons why banks were rapidly shedding their reserves since 2018. The Fed is now engaging in monthly purchases of $60 billion Treasury bills until through the second half of the year.\n\n\u201cThe move to $60 billion of bills is very significant, and it\u2019s the right policy action,\u201d Cabana said. \u201cBut personally, I wish they did more,\u201d he added. Cabana said he felt the U.S. central bank should have announced a larger and more accelerated schedule of debt buying to boost the level of reserves in the financial system.\n\nSince September, stocks have steadily neared all-time highs. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.22% were less than 1% away from their record close on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.14% traded at 1.733%.\n\nRead: Fed\u2019s Williams says central bank would adjust plan to soothe funding markets \u2018as appropriate\u2019\n\nIn recent days, executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs blamed stringent post-crisis liquidity rules that penalized banks if they didn\u2019t hoard cash reserves beyond usual capital requirements, or excess reserves. Part of the issue was their holdings of Treasurys weren\u2019t considered on par with cash.\n\nAnalysis by the Fed last year showed a select few banks held the majority of the reserves in the financial system, drawing questions why they did not pass them round to other cash-starved market participants.\n\n\u201cBanks did not have a distribution problem, they have a concentration issue,\u201d Cabana said. \u201cThe banks could have lent their reserves, but they didn\u2019t want to. Because banks are told by their supervisors they need to hold a high amount of assets in the most liquid form \u2014 reserves \u2014 those who had reserves didn\u2019t want to have them falling further,\u201d he said.\n\nCabana suggested the warning signs were there for Fed officials well before September. During 2018 when the Fed was raising interest rates, the central bank also increased the interest rate it paid out to banks for holding excess reserves by increments of 20 basis points, instead of the full quarter point.\n\n\u201cThere was increased money market sensitivity that the Fed was getting close to reserve scarcity, and the Fed partially ignored that,\u201d he said.\n\nCabana worried that the current actions the central bank had undertaken wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to prevent strains in funding markets from cropping up again at the end of the year, when banks are reluctant to lend money via the repo markets as they try to shrink their trading operations to avoid regulatory charges.\n\nHe said pressures in funding markets could far exceed that of the year-end in 2018.\n\nCheck out: Wall Street raises questions about Fed\u2019s late action on funding squeeze\n\nTo prevent short-term lending rates from spiking again, Cabana advocated for a permanent lending facility that market participants could tap, saving the Fed from having to make regular injections of liquidity. In addition, he suggested the central bank should look to buy shorter-term Treasury bonds instead of just Treasury bills to deliver on the balance sheet expansion it announced in October.\n\nMost of all, the central bank needs to be \u201cmore pre-emptive\u201d and give better guidance.\n\n\u201cThe market needs to know the Fed will ensure it will never happen again,\u201d said Cabana.", "description": "Mark Cabana of BAML was one of the most vocal market participants who warned investors of the emerging strains in short-term borrowing markets well before it...", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT745_cabana_ZG_20191022082622.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
