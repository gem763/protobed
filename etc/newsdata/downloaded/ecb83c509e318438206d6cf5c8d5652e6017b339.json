We talk a lot so it\u2019s easy for us because we talk the same language,\u201d said Raka.\n\n\u2013 Brawn drain \u2013\n\nThe list goes on. The elder brother of Fiji\u2019s Campese Ma\u2019afu played for Australia at the 2011 World Cup, while his younger brother has three caps with Tonga.\n\nEngland wing Cokanasiga, who left Fiji as a toddler, has been receiving messages from the family village during his campaign with England.\n\n\u201cDad always reminds Joe that when he represents England, he is also a Fijian and not to forget his roots,\u201d his brother Phil told the BBC.\n\nLobby group Pacific Rugby Players Welfare estimates about 20 percent of all professional players come from islander backgrounds.\n\nThe Pacific nations\u2019 geographical isolation, lack of financial resources and poor governance tempt players to move to rich clubs abroad, where they are eventually able to represent their adopted country through residency rules.\n\nThe brawn drain has become a severe irritant for the Pacific nations, which continue to struggle on the international stage while their most talented players ply their trade elsewhere.\n\nFiji\u2019s appearance in the 2007 quarter-finals was the only time a Pacific nation has made it to the World Cup knockout stages since Western Samoa in 1995.\n\nAfter losses to England, France and Argentina in Pool C, Kefu said his team needed more opportunities to play together if they were to beat Tier One nations.\n\n\u201cWe need more games which will bring more quality time together,\u201d he said, after Tonga\u2019s 21-23 defeat to France.\n\n\u201cWe also have a list of players that for some reason or another are not here. So those are the main things.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how he rated France\u2019s Raka and Vakatawa, Kefu said: \u201cHe (Raka) was outstanding.\n\n\u201cBoth Fijians were a threat.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 England forward Billy Vunipola\u2019s father represented Tonga, Joe Cokanasiga\u2019s cousin plays for Fiji and Australian prop", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/4ea756_england-wing-joe-cokanasiga-left-fiji-young-age-family-fortunes-pacific-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
