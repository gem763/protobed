Barton won both the main and the subsidiary song prize - foreshadowing the versatility she displayed at the Proms, where she was equally at home with opera, Gershwin and, of course, Rule Britannia.\n\nThe 37-year-old, who revealed her bisexuality on Twitter on National Coming Out Day 2014, said she wanted to use the Proms to make \"a very clear statement of Pride\".\n\nImage caption The dress was designed by Jessica Jahn and built by Donna Langman\n\n\"It's not only a very important thing to me personally, but it's also something I think unifies the audience,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not just queer pride, it's a connective celebration of people being exactly who they are and loving who they are. And I'm honoured to get to lead that.\"\n\nAs well as singing Judy Garland's gay anthem (\"it felt a little too on-brand not to do\"), Barton wore a gown featuring the colours of the bisexual flag - lavender, pink and blue - as \"a statement of the pride in my community\".\n\nHer messages of tolerance and inclusivity lent a modern touch to the flag-waving frolics of the Proms, but the touchstones of the Last Night remained as stoically immutable as ever.\n\nThe audience bobbed to the Hornpipe, they linked arms to Auld Lang Syne, and they set off party poppers at comically inappropriate moments.\n\nThe programme also included nods to the main themes of this year's Proms: Laura Mvula's Sing To The Moon marked the 50th anniversary of the lunar landings; and a delicately beautiful version of Elgar's Sospiri marked the 150th anniversary of Proms co-founder Sir Henry Wood, who premiered the piece in 1914, just nine days after Britain declared war.\n\nAcross the UK, Proms In The Park events allowed fans to follow the action on big screens, as well as enjoying live performances from the likes of Barry Manilow, Barbara Dickson, Jack Savoretti and Susan Boyle.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The best bits of the 2019 Proms in four minutes\n\nAs the concert ended, Omaro, who was conducting the Last Night for his fourth time, paid tribute to live music audiences.\n\n\"The explosion of social media in our lives has caused our attention span to decrease,\" he said from a podium decked in streamers.\n\n\"So why have you lovely people, here tonight, chosen to come and hear live music? Why do you, our radio and TV audiences, switch on?\n\n\"I hope it's because it's a wonderful experience to come to a concert and listen with complete concentration to an orchestra and chorus perform live.\"\n\nHis comments came at the close of a Proms season that encompassed 85 concerts in just 58 days.\n\nHighlights included a soul-stirring tribute to Nina Simone, a musical recreation of the moon landings, and a performance of Mendelssohn's First Piano Concerto, played on Queen Victoria's own piano.\n\nMore than 300,000 concert-goers attended the festival, with one in five purchasing on-the-day tickets for \u00a36.\n\nThe Proms will return for their 126th season on 17 July, 2020.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
