With over 1,000 people on the emergency housing list, however, it was soon revived.\n\nThe organisation behind the project is Aprop \u2013 an acronym meaning \u201clocal provisional housing\u201d that also means \u201cclose by\u201d in Catalan \u2013 which is working in conjunction with three architectural practices.\n\nDavid Ju\u00e1rez, an architect at Straddle3, one of the practices involved, says people have an image of a \u201cnaff\u201d project but that there is nothing shabby about the one- and two-bedroom flats being constructed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest How the Barcelona homes will look inside, according to Aprop. Photograph: APROP\n\nThey will be built to the same standards as conventional housing, with good thermal and sound insulation and under-floor heating, he says, and when the work is complete they will not even be recognisable as containers.\n\n\u201cThese container homes are built to a higher standard than much of what is on the rental market in Barcelona,\u201d says the housing activist Jaime Palomera, spokesman for the city\u2019s Tenants\u2019 Union. \u201cThis idea that the poor are being forced to live in sardine tins is nonsense.\u201d\n\nBut concerns have been raised about this type of housing.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem with containers is insulation, both thermal and noise,\u201d says Co Govers of the Zest Architecture practice in Barcelona, which specialises in low-energy construction.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest La Rambla, Barcelona.

You have to add massive amounts of insulation, which is expensive.\u201d Some forms of internal insulation also further reduce the cramped living space.\n\nThere has been criticism of a similar scheme in Ealing, west London. The children\u2019s commissioner for England recently criticised container flats as unsuitable and unsafe, and residents have said they are cramped, stiflingly hot in summer, and too cold in winter.\n\nThe total cost of the scheme in Barcelona is \u20ac940,000 (\u00a3840,000). \u201cWe can deliver an apartment in a year while a traditional building takes six to eight years to reach completion,\u201d says Tonet Font of the city\u2019s social innovation department. Work is expected to be completed by the end of October.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nasibah Yagoub, 21, with her son outside a shipping container development being used for homeless families in Hanwell, Ealing.

This sounds expensive for temporary housing.\u201d\n\nBarcelona already has an abysmally low level of public housing \u2013 1.5% of the total stock, compared with 28% in Berlin.\n\nLocal authorities depend on central government funding to finance building projects but have been starved of cash in recent years. Currently only 0.05% of GDP is set aside for public housing.\n\nJu\u00e1rez says Aprop\u2019s prime motivation is to resist the tide of gentrification that is driving all but the most well-to-do out of the city centre as speculation and tourist apartments force up rents and house prices.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A worker walks on the construction site of the flats on Carrer Nou de Sant Francesc. Photograph: Pau Barrena/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cNearly all social housing is built on the outskirts and not in the city centre,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is because most of the work on public housing is done by a few big construction companies and they are only interested in big projects.\n\n\u201cWe can produce housing in much smaller empty spaces that exist all over the city. And if we can do this in a neighbourhood as dense as Ciutat Vella, we can do it anywhere.\u201d\n\nPalomera says: \u201cWhat\u2019s been happening in cities is that private investors have been building luxury homes on these sites, and what the council is trying to do is gain some ground on investment funds and produce quality public housing instead.\u201d\n\nIn the digital age, how much longer can Spain's street kiosks survive?

I think the majority are positive but are reserving judgment until they see what it looks like.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "Just a stone\u2019s throw from La Rambla, the Spanish city is building 12 shipping container flats to help tackle its social housing crisis", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0acacab2e183bb030d875c79f0f328a63bf0ea/0_167_5048_3030/master/5048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=836c7bf3918691bc77652b83a539b092", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
