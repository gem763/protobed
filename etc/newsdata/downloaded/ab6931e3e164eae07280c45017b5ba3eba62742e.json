We\u2019re not yet talking about a large-scale military intervention in the region.\u201d\n\nU.S. 10-Year Treasury note futures prices rose 0.2 pct at the start of trading.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that energy costs don\u2019t rise by some amount worldwide so the long nightmare of disinflation and below target inflation is over, and that\u2019s why the Treasury market is not going to have this flight-to-quality drop in yields,\u201d said David Kotok, chairman & chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors.", "description": "U.S. stock futures fell 0.3% percent when trading resumed on Sunday, a day after attacks on Saudi oil facilities that risk disrupting global energy supplies.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
