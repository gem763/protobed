The move was curious because, despite Kendrick\u2019s slow start, he\u2019d been the team\u2019s third-best hitter all season and delivered in the clutch throughout the postseason (see: Game 5 of the National League Division Series). Cabrera had also not caught fire to start the series, and his 3-for-9, three-RBI line almost mirrors Kendrick\u2019s (2 for 9, one RBI).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCabrera has better numbers against Greinke (16 for 37, six walks, two strikeouts, three RBI) than Kendrick (5 for 20, two RBI, two strikeouts). But the lion\u2019s share of Cabrera\u2019s success against the veteran right-hander came six or seven years ago. Manager Dave Martinez understood that, but he said he reviewed recently at-bats and liked what he saw on film.\n\n\u201cI saw a lot more groundballs in Howie against Greinke,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw some better opportunities with Cabrera hitting the ball up in the air. I like that.\u201d\n\nGame preview\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe energy has hit 11 because not only are the Nationals in the World Series again, but they\u2019ve seized a stunning 2-0 lead over the juggernaut Houston Astros. This development has surprised even the players.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a success if we only came in and stole one game,\u201d star third baseman Anthony Rendon said in Houston on Wednesday. He added winning both was \u201cgreat,\u201d in typically understated Rendon fashion. But his expression after the 12-3, Game 2 win betrayed his surprise that they\u2019d pulled this off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis absurd team, this inability to stop having fun, this tantalizingly close brush with a championship has fans forgetting all the heartbreaks which came before it. Even as Astros Manager A.J. Hinch vowed on Thursday night his team would not go down without a fight, calls and emails poured into local media expressing confidence that the Nationals could pull off a sweep, which was unthinkable even two days ago. If Gerardo Parra pinch-hits in a close game, the reverberations of the \u201cBaby Shark\u201d chomps might break the stadium off its moors and float away into the Anacostia River. (Okay, that\u2019s a bit much.)\n\nThe Nationals, on the field, are throwing fourth starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez against the Astros\u2019 third starter Zack Greinke. The mid-30s right-handers are not the fireballing aces of the last two nights, and their bevies of pitches and difficult off-speed symbolize the veteran craftiness needed to survive more than a decade in the majors.\n\nBut, up until first pitch on Friday, the focus won\u2019t be on the field. This game, this elite and silly Nationals team, has helped people sit back and think about what\u2019s happened not just to the team since baseball returned. It\u2019s held up a mirror to a part of the city.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOkay, I wasn't going to do this, but what the heck. Let's walk to #Nats Park, before the ballpark was built, and now. We'll start by the subway station at New Jersey and M, in 2005 and now.
