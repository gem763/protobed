There are so many wonderful things I wish people knew about you.\n\n\"There are SO many things, so I will only name a few. For all the years of your life, you have glowed from the inside out.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"There has always been a magnetic energy about you. You've written your own set of rules, always with love. \"\n\nShe finished off the heartwarming post with: \"You are everything to so many but especially me.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAlong with the video of Kim, 35-year-old Khloe shared a selection of pictures of her sister, showing off how proud she is.\n\nSome included snaps of the Hollywood star posing for big-name brands, such as their family Calvin Klein campaign, and another of the sisters together looking glammed up as usual.", "description": "The middle Kardashian sister celebrated her 39th birthday and her youngest sister surprised her with a throwback", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20669414.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Kim-Karsashian.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
