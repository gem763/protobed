Officials said the government is considering earmarking a larger share of the reserves for disaster relief and crafting a supplementary budget.\n\nMeanwhile, rescuers continued to wade through mud to search for survivors of Typhoon Hagibis -- though the first 72 hours considered critical for finding more people have lapsed.\n\nAt least 74 people were killed by the typhoon and more than a dozen were missing, according to a Kyodo News tally, based on official information collected from each region.\n\nSpeaking at the House of Councillors Budget Committee, Abe reiterated a government plan to survey affected regions and determine whether they could be designated as suffering from a serious disaster, which would trigger further subsidies for recovery efforts.\n\n\"We will make the utmost effort so the disaster victims can return to their lives without worries as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\nPeople rest at an evacuation center in Date City, Fukushima Prefecture, on Wednesday.

Officials said the river's water levels reached as high as 23 meters.\n\nThe infrastructure ministry has confirmed collapsed embankments at 79 locations along 55 rivers as of 5 a.m., up from 74 announced Tuesday as it continues to assess the extent of the damage.\n\nThe Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism said it plans to set up a panel of experts to study damage along seven state-controlled rivers that flooded neighboring areas.\n\nThe panel plans to draw conclusions in a few months as to why river embankments collapsed, and how to rebuild them in a more resilient way.\n\nThe seven rivers include the Abukuma, the Chikuma in Nagano Prefecture and the Yoshida in Miyagi Prefecture.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Japan will disburse about 710 million yen from reserves in the fiscal 2019 budget to deal with the aftermath of the most powerful typhoon to hit the country in decades, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Wednesday.
