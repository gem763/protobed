It added that he took in a bird\u2019s-eye view \u201cthat looked like the high steep mountains of the revolution he has to pass in high spirits.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe official account hailed his ascent as reflecting \u201cthe majesty of the illustrious commander\u201d who was determined to advance his country to \u201cachieve prosperity with its own efforts, meeting all headwinds.\u201d\n\nExperts speculated that the dictator\u2019s trip up Mount Paektu could signal a major announcement, amid faltering nuclear diplomacy with the United States.\n\nRachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with the NK Pro website based in Seoul, said Pyongyang\u2019s coverage of Kim\u2019s ride emphasized power and a hard line against concessions to the outside world.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cState media has consistently played up North Korea\u2019s rise to the ranks of powerful states as one of Kim\u2019s major achievements after the failed Hanoi summit,\u201d she said, referring to Kim\u2019s February meeting with President Trump.\n\nThe coverage also emphasized the visit\u2019s symbolism and said it was for \u201cmeditation,\u201d Lee said, suggesting the regime may be about to make decisions on key issues.\n\nKim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, was supposedly visited by a white horse during his battles against Japanese occupation and was often pictured riding such a steed. Lee said the regime\u2019s reporting was also meant to suggest similarities between the younger Kim and his grandfather, North Korea\u2019s founding leader.\n\nAD\n\nRelations between North Korea and its southern neighbor have nose-dived since Kim took Moon up the mountain last year, while talks with the United States in Stockholm this month ended with North Korea issuing an angry denunciation of Washington.\n\nAD\n\nThe image of Kim on horseback was also reminiscent of the macho imagery employed by Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, who often appears bare-chested while riding, swimming and fishing.\n\nKim has given the United States until the end of the year to change what North Korea calls its \u201chostile policy\u201d or face unspecified consequences.\n\nIn separate remarks released Wednesday after a trip to construction sites in nearby Samjiyon county, Kim had a message of defiance for the United States, and a vow that his country would prosper despite international sanctions.\n\nAD\n\nThe pain the U.S.-led \u201chostile forces\u201d had inflicted on the Korean people \u201cis no longer pain but it turned into their anger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever the enemies try to strangle us with the chain of pressure, we should pave the way with our own efforts to continue to live well under the banner of the great spirit of self-reliance so that the enemies feel a pain in their stomach and head,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nBy visiting Samjiyon, Kim was trying to show that North Korea is standing strong despite sanctions, said Lim Eul-chul, an expert on the North Korean economy at Kyungnam University in Seoul.\n\n\u201cFor the domestic audience, Kim intends to lower the expectations for nuclear talks with the United States and give a fresh push for \u2018self-reliance,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cFor people outside North Korea, Kim is showing that he won\u2019t give into the sanctions pressure to make concessions in negotiations with Washington.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Photos showing the North Korean leader on horseback in the snow, atop an active volcano, could presage a major announcement.", "authors": ["Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea.", "Min Joo Kim", "Assistant Reporter In Seoul Covering South", "North Korea."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uFajCp2q08lZ6CUExpsIa_JwGog=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GIY34EHP5AI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
