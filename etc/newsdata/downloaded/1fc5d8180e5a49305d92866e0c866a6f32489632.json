This is Money podcast", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s crunch time for Brexit and things could go one of three ways.\n\nTheoretically, a no-deal Brexit shouldn\u2019t be able to happen and the Prime Minister has to ask for an extension instead, but we are faced with the bizarre prospect of the Government saying it might be able to dodge the law\u2026 and so maybe no-deal could still happen.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the possibility that instead of no-deal or an extension, we actually get a deal.\n\nAmid all this, we\u2019ve had news that the UK economy slowed earlier this year and fresh fears over recession, global trade war worries have stepped up a bit, an election\u2019s on the cards, the stock market\u2019s been tumbling and interest rates are going to head down not up.\n\nSo, is it time to batten down the hatches, or should you be optimistic and aim to be greedy while others are fearful?\n\nIt's crunch time for Brexit... unless we get another extension and the game goes on\n\nOn this week\u2019s podcast, Simon Lambert, Tanya Jefferies and Georgie Frost look at what the latest episode in the Brexit soap opera means for our money, from savings and investments, to mortgages and holiday money.\n\nThey also discuss the question of whether it is too late to protect your finances against no-deal?\n\nAlso on this week\u2019s show, the women\u2019s state pension age case defeat and what it means, the almost certain 4 per cent rise for the state pension next year, and what Drastic Dave\u2019s departure from Tesco means for the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket.\n\nAnd finally, you might fancy a classic car but think you can\u2019t afford one \u2013 but the team have got ten bargain cars tipped for future classic status that put one in reach (and Simon explains how man maths means they\u2019re almost free).", "description": "We look at what the latest episode in the Brexit soap opera means for our money, from savings and investments, to mortgages and holiday money - whether it is too late to protect your finances?", "authors": ["This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
