It's one of the many features that makes Tesla's Model 3 sedan ultra safe in crashes.\n\nIt will be a while yet before South Africans will be able to get their hands on any Tesla vehicle. Elon Musk admitted via a tweet that Tesla models won't arrive locally due to the country's import duties, reported Janine Van der Post Wheels24 journalist.\n\nWould love to, but import duties are extremely high, even for electric vehicles \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 28, 2019\n\nThe Model 3 is an all-electric plug-in, meaning that the front compartment doesn't have an engine like a normal combustion car would. Instead, all the empty steel and aluminium at the front of the car crumples, drawing the shock of the crash away from the occupants.\n\n\n\nA large crumple zone isn't the only special feature that makes the Model 3 safe. The Model 3 received top overall marks in multiple tests, like roof strength, head restraints and seats tests, and autonomous driver-assistance systems tests, much in part due to the advanced safety technology special on the car.\n\nThe Model 3 has a suite of driver-assist systems designed to keep you from getting into an accident, including an automatic emergency-braking system that detects obstacles and stops the car on its own. It scored an astounding 94% in the Safety Assist category for halting automatically for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as correcting inattentive driving.\n\nWhile the Model 3 received top marks from IIHS and other safety organizations, it's one of many vehicles with excellent safety ratings. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Lexus ES 350 scored top marks in every category, while the Audi e-tron, another electric plug-in vehicle, also received IIHS's highest safety award. A hydrogen car, the Hyundai Nexo SUV, received results comparable to the Model 3.\n\nTesla has long touted the super safety of their crash technology, and now the evidence is in.\n\nCompiled by Jay Caboz\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Tesla has long touted the super safety of their crash technology, and now the evidence is in.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7925/f144b044f324474194d8ee55e606de02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
