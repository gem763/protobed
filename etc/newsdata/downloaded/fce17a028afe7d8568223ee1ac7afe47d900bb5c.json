(New Wave Foods)\n\nTyson Foods is riding the new wave. Literally. On Thursday the world\u2019s second-largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef and pork announced it is moving in a whole new direction: plant-based shellfish. Tyson has invested in New Wave Foods, a San Francisco-based start-up that will debut plant-based shrimp early next year.\n\n\u201cI was introduced to New Wave by a venture capital friend of mine, and I flew out and had the product prepared for me by a chef, and I didn\u2019t even know it wasn\u2019t shrimp,\u201d says Tom Mastrobuoni, chief financial officer of Tyson Ventures.\n\n[Veggie burgers were living an idyllic little existence. Then they got caught in a war over the future of meat.]\n\nThis is a new entry into the plant-based protein revolution led by Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, a heady world of products that cook, bleed and chew like real flesh. Since Beyond\u2019s stratospheric IPO in May, plant-based debuts have been the talk of the food world, with establishment companies such as Smithfield, Perdue and Nestl\u00e9 jumping on board.\n\nTyson was an early adopter, owning a 6.52 percent share in Beyond Meat, only to hop out pre-public offering to announce its own plant-based meat brand, Raised & Rooted.\n\n[Who are you calling chicken? Tyson Foods is getting into the business of plant-based meat.]\n\nThis, however, is something largely unprecedented, according to New Wave chief executive Mary McGovern.\n\n\u201cThis is the first disrupter in this particular kind of protein, and there\u2019s a clear advantage to coming in and being the first disruptive shrimp.\u201d\n\nShrimp are the most-consumed seafood on the planet, and No. 1 in the United States by a factor of two. If a product that tastes like the real thing can be debuted at a similar price point, there\u2019s the potential for big business.\n\nOnce established, the company intends to follow with plant-based versions of crab and lobster.\n\nMcGovern says plant-based shrimp will be rolled out in restaurants. Eighty percent of shrimp are consumed in food service, and she says the advantages for a restaurateur are consistency.\n\nConsistency of size and shape, as well as consistency in price. Farmed and wild shrimp vacillate in seasonal pricing between $4 and $11 per pound wholesale, which can make menu pricing frustrating.\n\nConvenience and consistency mean very little, however, if the taste and essential \u201cshrimpiness\u201d aren\u2019t there. The job fell to Michelle Wolf, co-founder and chief technology officer of New Wave. With seaweed extract as a main ingredient and a plant protein augmented by two other proprietary ingredients, the sham shrimp\u2019s biggest challenge was texture.\n\n\u201cWe have been wholly focused on making this a product for the flexitarian,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cIt has to provide the bite and texture and characteristic snap of shrimp. It was critical to get the texture, so much of the work has gone into that.\u201d\n\nWolf says the product looks like a peeled, deveined and tailless cooked shrimp but is hypoallergenic, lower in calories and cholesterol, and higher in fiber.\n\nNot everyone is bullish about how a plant-based shellfish will be received in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s worked so well for the plant-based burger is that it\u2019s disguised, it\u2019s masked with sauces and condiments, and there\u2019s not a compromise with texture and taste,\u201d said Eddie Yoon, founder of Eddie Would Grow, a think tank on growth strategies.\n\n\u201cIf you think about meatballs, you\u2019re drowning them in tomato sauce, cheese. Chicken nuggets get breading. From a seafood perspective, there\u2019s not a lot of disguising going on,\u201d Yoon said.\n\nIf Tyson is smart, he says, it will roll out the product in areas where seafood plays a bigger role in regional cuisine. No matter what, he says, its reception is likely to be slower, partly because shellfish is more niche than burgers and nuggets.\n\n[From lab to table: Will cell-cultured meat win over Americans?]\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll need restaurants chefs to get excited about this.\u201d\n\nSome already are.\n\nChef Spike Mendelsohn debuts his newest plant-based restaurant concept, PLNT Burger in Silver Spring, next week. He says Tyson\u2019s decision to invest in New Wave\u2019s plant-based shellfish is a savvy one.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s room for anything right now, to be honest. We\u2019re experiencing a universal shift in how we think about food.\u201d\n\nHe says customers will be reassured by the use of seaweed as a central ingredient, as people have been eating it for centuries. Consumers will also be drawn to New Wave\u2019s smaller environmental footprint, he argues, as well as its lack of involvement in overfishing or unfair labor practices.\n\nThe positioning of this new product is crucial, according to Mendelsohn. This new array of plant-based products is largely targeting omnivores aiming for the occasional meat alternative.\n\n\u201cBeyond Meat wanted to be in the meat aisle, not the veggie burger aisle, and that was brilliant.\u201d", "description": "Tyson has invested in New Wave Foods, a San Francisco-based start-up that will debut plant-based shrimp early next year.", "authors": ["Laura Reiley", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Food", "September At Am", "Laura Reiley Is The Business Of Food Reporter.
