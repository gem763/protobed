The TMC MP\u2019s decision to wear a Western outfit for the first day of the inaugural session of the Parliament was criticised.\n\nThen, she was under fire for wearing sindoor and chooda after getting married to entrepreneur Nikhil Jain. She faced backlash for sporting these symbols of Hindu matrimony, despite growing up as a Muslim.\n\nNow, the TMC MP is under fire once again, this time for visiting a Durga Pooja Pandal in Kolkata. Nusrat was there with her husband, and sang and danced with the gathered crowds.\n\n\n\nHere is what the Muslim clerics had to say\n\nMufti Asad Qasmi, a cleric associated with Darul Uloom Deoband, on Monday said the MP should change her name and religion because she is \"defaming Islam and Muslims\" by her actions.\n\nNusrat responded to the allegations with this statement: \"Those who have not given me my name, do not have any right to ask me to change it. This is not a matter of Hindu or Muslim. My message to clerics...relax a bit...happy puja.\" The MP had spoken to a section of the media, after the cleric\u2019s statements made headlines.\n\nA problematic defence from a Union Minister\n\nThe episode took another turn when Union minister Debasree Chaudhuri came to Nusrat\u2019s defence. This is what she said: \"Everybody should respect personal choices. It is her choice and she has the freedom to practice or participate in any festival of her choice. And in India, a married woman generally practises the religion of her husband. And we all know that Nusrat has married Nikhil Jain.\"\n\nNusrat Jahan\u2019s stance on her religious identity\n\nNusrat Jahan has always maintained that she chooses to remain a practising Muslim. So, when we ascribe her husband\u2019s religion to her, we are questioning her agency to choose her faith. The statement by the Minister therefore becomes self-contradictory.\n\n\n\nThe traditional model of marriage demands that women give up most of their identity (name, familial traditions, home, etc.) and merge with the husband\u2019s family. And the minister\u2019s statement is just a reflection of the same mentality.\n\nAfter an earlier furore over her sporting the sindoor, Nusrat had tweeted: \"I represent an inclusive India which is beyond the barriers of caste, creed and religion. None should comment on what I chose to wear. Faith is beyond attire and is more about believing and practising the invaluable doctrines of all religions.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": "Trinamool Congress,Nusrat Jahan, Nusrat Jahan Durga Pooja, Nusrat Jahan Durga Pooja pandal, Nusrat Jahan wedding pictures, Nusrat Jahan husband, Nusrat Jahan Nikhil Jain, Nusrat Jahan Mimi Chakraborty", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_MP-Nusrat-Jahan-Caught-In-Religious-Crossfire-This-Time-Over-Pandal-Visit-_Social_5d9c2d72b2d72.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
