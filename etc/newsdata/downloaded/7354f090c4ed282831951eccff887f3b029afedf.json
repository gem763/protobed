Have no idea what\u2019s going on? Welcome to the club. Everyone is all over the place.\n\nLET\u2019S BE PERFECTLY CLEAR: At this point, it looks as if President DONALD TRUMP will be impeached by the House, and the WHITE HOUSE has struggled mightily with how to handle this. This administration operates at the whims of TRUMP, and on an issue as politically and legally complex as impeachment, that seems like a foolhardy play. The first play seemed to be to try to scare Democrats out of impeachment with an angry letter by the White House counsel. That, quite predictably, fell on deaf ears.\n\nNOW THE WHITE HOUSE HAS an acting chief of staff who seems like he\u2019s on the brink of being fired. Their plan to hire Trey Gowdy never panned out. Their communications strategy seems to be the president angrily tweeting about \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d and a \u201cperfect phone call.\u201d RUDY GIULIANI, the president\u2019s lawyer, is in his own legal jeopardy.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE HAS GRIPED about having no visibility into the closed-door proceedings on Capitol Hill -- even though Republicans are keeping them in the loop. TRUMP said Tuesday he didn\u2019t know Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the most recent official to testify. This might seem curious since Vindman focused on Ukraine, which the president says was a top priority for him.\n\nCAPITOL HILL REPUBLICANS ARE NO LESS LOST. They mounted a weekslong defense on process, only to be told publicly by the president that they should drop that argument, and focus on defending him on the merits.\n\nMEANWHILE, DEMOCRATS SPENT ALL WEEK trumpeting and explaining a new impeachment resolution, missing an opportunity to ride the wave of Vindman\u2019s damning testimony. The impeachment resolution, by the way, enacts modest tweaks to the arcane rules that govern committee hearings. (If you care: Top lawmakers and staff get more time to question witnesses. Republicans can request witnesses. The president\u2019s lawyers can participate in hearings -- but at Dems\u2019 discretion. The House Intelligence Committee is leading the probe -- but you knew that already.)\n\nWATCH FOR REPUBLICANS to try to jam up this process with procedural tricks, and try to force many votes on amendments to make life difficult for Democrats.\n\nAS JOHN BRESNAHAN put it Tuesday: One side doesn\u2019t know how to handle impeachment, and the other side is trying to overmanage it.\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT WE STILL DON\u2019T KNOW: When will Democrats make their case to the public -- something they\u2019ve said for months they need to make? There are 63 days until the end of 2019 -- will impeachment wrap up before then? Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment took 55 days. Heck, will we even see public hearings by the end of the year?\n\nAND WHERE WILL SENATORS LAND? Many senators have been a bit cagey, using the I\u2019ll-be-a-juror excuse as a way to not weigh in on what\u2019s happening in the House. Will Republican senators back Trump and push for a speedy trial? Or will they take a more measured approach, and could there be defections? Also: Will any Senate ***Democrats*** defect and vote to acquit?\n\nUNDERSTAND THE DEMS\u2019 NEW IMPEACHMENT RESOLUTION, via Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle and Kyle Cheney: \u201cThe resolution is less about imbuing impeachment investigators with new power than about directing traffic as multiple committees jockey for jurisdiction over the high-stakes probe. It lays out that the House Intelligence panel decides which hearings to hold. And it allows Schiff to add rounds of uninterrupted questioning for himself and ranking Republican Devin Nunes \u2014 up to 45 minutes per side \u2014 as many times as necessary. Both Schiff and Nunes may yield their questioning time to staffers.\n\n\u201cThat's a slight change from existing House rules which permit committee chairs to add a single round of staff questioning at 30 minutes per side.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the resolution spells out that Republicans may request to call witnesses \u2014 which is already permitted under House rules \u2014 and issue subpoenas. In both cases, the requests are subject to a veto by Schiff and committee Democrats, a similar arrangement to previous impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe resolution also preserves the authority of House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). While it affords Trump and his legal team a chance to mount a defense and cross-examine witnesses, those powers will all be subject to Nadler's discretion. Those details, specifically for Judiciary, were outlined in a separate document released later Tuesday.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NOT SO FAST \u2026 JOSH GERSTEIN: \u201cAppeals court delays House\u2019s access to Mueller grand jury secrets\u201d\n\nBIG \u2026 NYT: \u201cWhite House Ukraine Expert Sought to Correct Transcript of Trump Call,\u201d by Julian Barnes, Nick Fandos and Danny Hakim: \u201cLt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, told House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that the White House transcript of a July call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president omitted crucial words and phrases, and that his attempts to restore them failed, according to three people familiar with the testimony.\n\n\u201cThe omissions, Colonel Vindman said, included Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\u201d NYT\n\nA message from PhRMA: FACT: Speaker Pelosi\u2019s drug pricing plan would siphon $1 trillion or more from biopharmaceutical innovators over the next 10 years.

And Chuck Schumer says he\u2019s \u2018increasingly worried\u2019 that it might come to fruition.\n\n\u201cAs he and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell battle over government funding, the Senate minority leader said on Tuesday that he\u2019s fretting that Trump will balk at a short-term spending bill during the Democratic effort to oust him from office.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m increasingly worried that President Trump will want to shut down the government again because of impeachment,\u2019 Schumer told reporters. \u2018He always likes to create diversions. I hope and pray he won\u2019t want to cause another government shutdown because it might be a diversion away from impeachment.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\nSPOTTED at dinner at the Trump Hotel after the \u201cTake Back the House\u201d fundraiser featuring Trump: Trump, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP Reps.

The man, whose nationality had not been revealed, is expected to receive some or all of the $25 million U.S. bounty that had been placed on Baghdadi\u2019s head, according to the officials. One official said he was a Sunni Arab who turned against the Islamic State because one of his relatives had been killed by the group.\u201d WaPo\n\nDRIVE THE KNIFE IN, BRADLEY!, via WaPo\u2019s Seung Min Kim: \u201c[Alabama GOP Senate candidate Rep.

He has spent so much time around the Trump White House that Republicans here and in Washington began to wonder if he was seeking an administration job to escape a difficult re-election. But when one well-connected Kentucky Republican inquired about that possibility with an administration official the word came back that there was no mutual interest: \u2018We like him where he is,\u2019 the official replied icily, according to the Republican here.\u201d NYT\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S JOSH ROGIN spoke with JOE BIDEN: \u201cBiden lamented that Trump\u2019s own friends and officials have essentially tricked him into leaving some troops in Syria by telling him he could control the oil there and referred to a U.S. official telling The Post: \u2018This is like feeding a baby its medicine in yogurt or applesauce.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s like dealing not with a commander in chief, but a whiner in chief,\u2019 said Biden. \u2018It\u2019s bizarre.\u2019\u201d WaPo\n\n-- \u201cPoll: Voters split on whether country is ready for a gay president,\u201d by Caitlin Oprysko: \u201cAs the Democratic Party fields its first serious presidential contender who is openly gay, half of American voters say that they personally are ready for a gay or lesbian president, but are split about whether the country as a whole is ready.\n\n\u201cAccording to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll of registered voters, 50 percent of respondents said they were either definitely or probably ready to have a commander in chief who is openly gay, compared with 37 percent who said they were either definitely or probably not ready.\u201d POLITICO\n\nGREAT STORY -- MATT DIXON in Tallahassee: \u201cTrump rescues Florida GOP fundraiser amid leadership fight\u201d: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s promise to headline the Republican Party of Florida\u2019s annual fundraiser has given it a much-needed financial and emotional boost going into 2020, even as the news has laid bare divisions within the state party\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cThe party\u2019s scramble to land a Trump visit culminated in a political victory for Gov.

That makes some people very happy, and it makes some people very mad. But if we are a country that lives by the rule of law, we must all accept that we have one president at a time and that president attained his office by the choice of the American people. When I was in the administration, I served alongside colleagues who believed that the best thing to do for America was to undermine and obstruct the president. Some wrote about it anonymously in The New York Times. Others just did it.\n\n\u201cThey sincerely believed they were doing the right thing. I sincerely believed they weren\u2019t. The president was the choice of the people, in accordance with our founding charter. No policy disagreement with him, no matter how heartfelt, justifies undermining the lawful authority that is vested in his office by the Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor those who don\u2019t like the president, they are free to protest him, and many do. But if you serve in the administration, you are not free to push your personal agenda. What\u2019s at stake is not President Trump\u2019s policies.
