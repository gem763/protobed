Trump has dismissed the inquiry as another Democratic attempt to unfairly target him.\n\nThe dramatic move has increased the prospect of prolonged political uncertainty in the world's largest economy. It comes at a time of fragile market sentiment, with investors already anxious about upcoming U.S.-China trade talks.\n\nTrump harshly criticized China's trade practices in a speech at the United Nations in the previous session, dampening hopes for a comprehensive breakthrough ahead of high-level talks in early October.\n\nOn the data front, new home sales for August will be released at around 10:00 a.m. ET.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury is set to auction $41 billion in five-year notes and $18 billion in floating-rate notes (FRNs) on Wednesday.", "description": "U.S. government debt prices were lower Wednesday morning, after the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106109874-1567543960040gettyimages-1163401856.jpeg?v=1567543991", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
