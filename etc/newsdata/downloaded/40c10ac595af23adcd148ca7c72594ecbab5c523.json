That's not including the 1.5 hours she's in the car each day. She usually doesn't get a chance to eat lunch or even drink much water,' Laura wrote.\n\n'She is so good at what she does that she often forgets how to take care of herself while she's taking care of her patients.'\n\nIn the photo, which has been shared 87,000 times so far this week, Caty is seen in her blue hospital scrubs breaking down into tears as she finally pauses to eat something when she got back to Laura's house.\n\n'This pic is from a night back in July where she came to my house after a particularly hard day,' Laura explained. 'She delivered a stillborn. Have you guys ever really thought about what a labor and delivery nurse sees?'\n\n'They see great joy in smooth deliveries and healthy moms and babies. They see panic and anxiety when a new mom is scared. They see fear when a stat c-section is called,' Laura continued.\n\nDevoted: Nurse Caty is seen proudly showcasing her employee of the year accolade in February 2019\n\n'They see peace when the mom has support from her family [because] not all new moms do. They see teenagers giving birth. They see an addicted mom give birth to a baby who is withdrawing. They see cps come. They see funeral homes come. Did you know that [nurses] have to make arrangements for the funeral home to come pick up the baby? I didn't either,' Laura wrote in the stark post.\n\nShe concluded by saying, 'Caty (and all other nurses) - you are SPECIAL. You bless your patients and their families more than you will ever know. Thank you for all that you do.'\n\nTwins: Laura, left, who uploaded the emotive post smiles with her twin sister Caty\n\nThe post struck a chord with social media users all over the world.\n\n'I\u2019m a nurse too and just reading this brought tears to my eyes. There is a lot behind the scenes that the majority know nothing about. [Caty] thank you for all the unknown things you do and the bearings you carry each day. You are truly appreciated,' a fellow nurse commended.\n\nOthers praised their partners, siblings, children and friends who work in hospitals, often tagging them in the comments to let them know they appreciate them and recognize the work that they do.\n\nThe post resonated with countless nurses too.\n\n'Many times I have cried all the way home because of a patient I had. Most days are good, but the ones that aren\u2019t good, stand out forever,' said one Pennsylvania-based nurse.\n\nOne Facebook user across the pond in the UK also chimed in, writing: 'These people are saints and deserve all praise in the world and more money. We should be proud and [grateful] to have these wonderful people in the NHS [National Health Service].'\n\nMany heartbroken woman and men left comments about experiencing stillbirths, and added that the selfless nurses who cared for them at the time helped to 'add a little sunshine to the darkness'.", "description": "A Texas-based nurse went viral unexpectedly when her twin sister shared an emotive post about how tirelessly she works.
