We are wondering if I should take his Fidelity MRD for 2019 now before he passes or later. I am also taking MRDs on My Fidelity account.\n\nIs there an advantage in taking his MRD's before he passes ? Should I wait until his IRAs are combined with mine ? I am 14 years younger than he is. He is 86. I am 72.\n\nThis is all so stressful. Thank you for any advice.", "description": "Hello I have not been on Morningstar in a while and I am totally confused by this new format.
