In the 90 minutes, Arsenal squandered a two-goal lead as Palace fought back superbly at the Emirates to secure a 2-2 draw.\n\nOn Xhaka\u2019s reaction, Emery said: \u2018He was wrong. We are going to speak to him and decide with the club.\n\n\u2018We are here because we have supporters. We work for them and need to have respect for them when they are applauding us and criticising us.\u2019\n\n\"He's wrong but we need to speak inside with him, and also to be calm about that reaction.\" Unai Emery speaks after his side threw away a 2-0 lead and Granit Xhaka reacted angrily to Arsenal fans' jeers.

I want to be calm but, really, he was wrong in this action.\u2019\n\nArsenal took full control of Sunday\u2019s clash through Sokratis Papastathopoulos and David Luiz but Palace responded with goals either side of half-time from Luka Milivojevic and Jordan Ayew.\n\nEmery admits Xhaka was \u2018wrong\u2019 (Picture: Getty)\n\nPalace\u2019s first goal came after VAR overturned a penalty decision in Wilfried Zaha\u2019s favour. VAR also ruled out an Arsenal goal late on.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t understand the referee and VAR reaction,\u2019 Emery said. \u2018Last week they didn\u2019t check VAR for a penalty for us but we respect that.\n\n\u2018Two weeks ago there is one penalty for Pepe against Bournemouth, they didn\u2019t check, okay. I don\u2019t understand.\n\n\u2018For me there is no confusion \u2013 it is not a good decision. We deserved to win, we had a good reaction after they equalised, we scored but then they didn\u2019t count it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t concede many chances apart from the penalty to score. Our reaction was very good, also the supporters help us in the last minutes to score the third goal and win the match but this doesn\u2019t happen.\u2019\n\nArsenal, still fifth in the Premier League, face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night.\n\nMORE: Jurgen Klopp provides Mohamed Salah injury update after Liverpool beat Tottenham", "description": "Unai Emery has hinted Granit Xhaka could lose the Arsenal captaincy after his shocking meltdown during the draw with Crystal Palace.
