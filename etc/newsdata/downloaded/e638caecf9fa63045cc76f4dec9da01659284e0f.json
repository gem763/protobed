Kamala D. Harris of California, a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said the report confirmed that Russia exploited racism, which she described as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel.\u201d\n\nShe also accused Mr. Trump of helping Russia to divide the country.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be frank. It\u2019s time for Trump to stop using Twitter to play into our adversaries\u2019 hands,\u201d she said. \u201cWith every deranged tweet, he advances foreign interests by dividing Americans. Social media companies must account for the role they play in amplifying Trump\u2019s dangerous rhetoric.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, California Democrat, blamed his Republican counterpart for not doing enough to combat another misinformation campaign by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hindered a full response ahead of the 2016 elections and continues to block a full-throated U.S. response today by burying meaningful election security bills in his legislative graveyard,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat will it take for Sen. McConnell to finally let the Senate do the people\u2019s business and protect the integrity of American democracy?\u201d\n\nThe Republican-led committee recommended combating Russian information warfare by improving coordination between social media companies and the government.\n\n\u201cBy flooding social media with false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls, and by exploiting existing divisions, Russia is trying to breed distrust of our democratic institutions and our fellow Americans,\u201d said Sen. Richard Burr, North Carolina Republican and the panel chairman.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
