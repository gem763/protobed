He reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund on a $4.2 billion loan last month and said last week he would withdraw the fuel subsidy, expand the number of families that receive a $15 monthly bonus and increase taxes on businesses that generate more than $10 million per year.\n\nAD\n\nThe scene in Ecuador as protests and clashes erupt over President Moreno's austerity measures share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Oct. 8, 2019 | Anti-government demonstrators gather in Quito, Ecuador, during clashes with the police as they protest President Len\u00edn Moreno and his economic policies. Ecuador has endured days of popular upheaval since the president scrapped fuel price subsidies, a step that set off protests and clashes across the country.

And you\u2019ll agree with me, it\u2019s not a good example to follow.\u201d\n\nWho's protesting?\n\nEcuador\u2019s transportation union protested the resulting jump in gasoline prices with a strike Thursday that brought the country to a standstill. The union lifted the strike Saturday, but by then, indigenous groups, young people and others had joined the protests.\n\nMoreno said Sunday that he was willing to open a dialogue with \u201cmy brothers, the indigenous people,\u201d but the protests have grown.\n\nAmherst College political scientist Javier Corrales sees a familiar pattern in recent Latin American history.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStates pursue expansionary policies that are unsustainable but which consumers like,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd eventually they\u2019re followed by restrictive policies that are inevitable but which consumers dislike.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhat has been the impact of the protests?\n\nOne protester died Sunday after being run over by a car. Authorities have reported vandalism of government facilities and looting; they have declared a state of emergency and deployed security forces. About 570 people have been arrested.\n\nThe suspension of oil field operations has cut the nation\u2019s production by 12 percent, the Energy Ministry said. Iv\u00e1n Ontaneda, minister of production, commerce and investment, told reporters the country has lost $1.4 billion over six days of protests.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat we are living is not a peaceful mobilization, it is crime and vandalism,\u201d Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Rold\u00e1n, Moreno\u2019s personal secretary, tweeted Tuesday. \u201cThose people must answer for their actions.\u201d\n\nWhat do others say?\n\nThe United Nations has called for an \u201cinclusive and effective dialogue\u201d between the government and protesters.\n\nAD\n\nVenezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has supported the protests. \u201cI express my solidarity with the people of Ecuador,\u201d Maduro tweeted Sunday. \u201cNo more IMF packages! No more misery!\u201d\n\nThe governments of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay and Peru backed Moreno, and accused Maduro of leading \u201cactions aimed at destabilizing our democracies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 also backed Moreno.\n\n\u201cWhile president Len\u00edn Moreno works to maintain and strengthen the republic and institutions of Ecuador,\u201d he tweeted, \u201ca group financed by Maduro\u2019s accomplices in America, taking advantage of the most vulnerable, seeks to end the country\u2019s stability. Solidarity with Ecuador.\u201d\n\nWhat now?\n\nIn a national address Monday night, Moreno said he was moving the government from Quito to the port city of Guayaquil. Appearing with his vice president and military commanders, he said he would not reverse his policies.\n\nAD\n\nMoreno blamed the chaos in the country on Correa and his foreign allies.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened these days is not a social protest against a decision by my government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe looting, vandalism and violence show that there\u2019s an organized action to destabilize my government.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCorrea, who served as president from 2007 to 2017, has praised the protesters and criticized the government. He has called for new elections.\n\n\u201cPlease. Moreno, quit,\u201d he tweeted Tuesday. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to our people.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Indigenous groups and young people are joining the demonstrations against Moreno\u2019s austerity measures.", "authors": ["Rachelle Krygier"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/97ywX5iIiAQau-ZmRGD4VxIpu3g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2I6FABXJ5AI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
