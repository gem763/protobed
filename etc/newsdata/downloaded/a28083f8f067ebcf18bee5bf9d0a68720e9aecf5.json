So we have pretty much almost a complete agreement on both of those issues.\n\n\"Currency has been a very big concern... and we have an agreement around transparency into the foreign exchange markets and free markets, so we are very pleased with that.\"\n\nThe US Treasury in August branded China a currency manipulator, accusing Beijing of deliberately weakening the yuan to gain unfair trade advantages.\n\n- Technology transfer -\n\nTrump said the talks had \"made very good progress on technology transfer\" -- a key point of friction.\n\nWithout giving further details, he said an agreement could be reached soon, with US companies sharing their know-how in exchange for access to Chinese markets.\n\n- Intellectual property -\n\n\"We have an agreement on intellectual property,\" the US president said, claiming another obstacle to an overall deal had been overcome.\n\n- Settling disputes -\n\nUS chief negotiator Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said a dispute settlement mechanism was being finalized.\n\nThe mechanism is seen as essential by the United States to enforcing any agreement.\n\nLighthizer said the next round of tariffs due to hit on December 15 could be canceled.", "description": "US President Donald Trump on Friday announced a partial trade deal with China after talks in Washington with Vice Premier Liu He.  \"We have a fundamental understanding on the key issues... but there is more work to do,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters.
