The industry has not yet gained back those jobs, with Dietz describing it as a \u201csluggish process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe JOLTS data says we\u2019re short about 350,000 workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe skilled labor shortage has gotten progressively more challenging as this lengthy growth cycle has continued. The impacts of it are \u2026 how long it takes for an individual homeowner to access a remodel, or how long that project will take. Those duration times have gone up.\u201d\n\nNearly 1.5 million construction jobs were lost during the Great Recession. (Chart: FRED Economic Data) More\n\n\u2018A whole set of limiting factors\u2019\n\nDietz said \u201cthere\u2019s a whole set of limiting factors\u201d for the construction industry over the last 10 years.\n\nDietz refers to these factors as the five L\u2019s in building: lack of labor, lack of lots, lack of lending for builders and land developers, lumber and material issues, and law issues.\n\n\u201cThe economic impact is the fact that we\u2019ve got a housing deficit,\u201d Dietz said. \u201cI think that\u2019s fairly clear. The housing deficit means a shortfall in inventory, which has resulted in home prices going up faster than incomes and faster than inflection.\u201d\n\nConstruction workers from the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development work in the heat on a road grading project on Airline Highway in St. Rose, La.

And it\u2019s contributed to the housing affordability prices. The fact that home prices have continued to outpace income growth, inflation growth. Inventory has been so tight, and the key reason for that has been the labor shortage.\u201d\n\nPart of the challenge is also demographics, with Baby Boomers becoming older.\n\n\u201cThe aging existing workforce, which took an enormous hit during the Great Recession with people losing jobs, in some cases leaving the industry and not wanting to come back, means that we really have this large deficit of skilled labor,\u201d Dietz said.\n\nThen, there are the millennials, who are becoming more and more college-educated.\n\nAmerica needs more construction workers.

That\u2019s a consequence, I believe, of the fact that we\u2019ve got a much greater fare of people going to four-year universities today than we did 30, 40, 50 years ago.\u201d\n\nWages may play a small role in the lack of available workers. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, the median annual wage for construction workers in May 2018 was $34,810.", "description": "Since the Great Recession, the U.S. has seen a major shortage of workers in the construction industry.", "authors": ["Adriana Belmonte", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lQwnfFJ2KoGv_8spE8Ktnw--~B/aD0zMjYwO3c9NDg5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/aa1ba0c0-54b2-11e9-b7b9-f8f96db6b879", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
