(Felix Dlangamandla, Netwerk24)\n\n\"In this context, I wish to emphasise that, consistent with our Constitution, all our registered political formations have an absolute obligation practically to contribute to the national effort to make ours a non-racial country.\n\n\"It would be a matter of the greatest concern if it were in fact true that our country's official opposition, the DA, is going through a leadership crisis because of a hegemonic ascendance of a racist tendency which seeks to assert policies to that end to sustain colonial and apartheid social relations.\n\n\"The millions of our people and our constitutional order will gain absolutely nothing from any negative movement in any of our political parties toward policies based on racism.\n\n\"The DA has an imperative obligation to reassure the nation, practically, unequivocally and transparently, that it is conducting and will conduct itself in terms of all its internal and public policies and programmes in a manner which truly helps to transform South Africa into a non-racial country.\"\n\nMbeki goes on to say that \"this is an obligation which binds all the political parties which serve within our legislatures, without exception\".\n\nFULL STATEMENT | Mmusi Maimane's final words as opposition leader: 'DA not suited to build One South Africa for All' Mmusi Maimane announced his resignation as the DA's leader, saying the party is not the vehicle best suited to take forward the vision of building one South Africa for all. He says as the leader of the DA he relentlessly sought to grow the party, specifically for black South Africans.\n\n\"Together, these must ensure that as elected representatives of the people, they faithfully discharge their solemn obligation to contribute to the building of the South Africa prescribed in our Constitution.\n\n\"Those who organise and act to frustrate the realisation of the goals detailed in our Constitution must understand that thereby they commit a criminal act against both the ordinary people in our country and the post-apartheid legal order which has sought to defend the interests of all our people without regard to race, class, gender, sexual orientation or creed.\"\n\n- Compiled by Ethan Van Diemen", "description": "Former president Thabo Mbeki has said he understands that current developments within the DA have to do with the ''continuing challenge of racism in our country''.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9518/b34c470b221b47b99824c911b232d4eb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
