The most important thing is for Biden not to be speaking about these issues with his dad, and for them to try and draw the lines.\u201d\n\nThose distinctions haven\u2019t stopped President Trump from making the younger Biden the butt of his campaign appearances, and his son, Eric Trump, from leading the \u201cLock him up!\u201d chant for Hunter.\n\nWith the realization that Trump\u2019s charges of corruption\u2014as false as they might be\u2014could sink the vice president\u2019s campaign, the Biden family finally pushed back.
