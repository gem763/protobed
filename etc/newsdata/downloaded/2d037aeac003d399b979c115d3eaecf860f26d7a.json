While the young Biden did have business interest overseas while he father was in office, there is no evidence of misconduct. Trump\u2019s adult children have faced congressional scrutiny for their foreign business dealings while their father is serving as president, and Trump still maintains ownership stakes in his family\u2019s businesses.\n\nThe rally in Minneapolis, the first since Democrats began proceedings two weeks ago to remove him from office, served as a proving ground for the president as he tries to use the impeachment inquiry to energize supporters for his 2020 campaign by casting himself \u2014 and his supporters \u2014 as victims of Democrats in the Washington swamp.\n\nThe performance revealed a defense strategy utterly detached from the allegations Trump faces. Trump spent little time defending his phone call with the Ukrainian president or his actions. Instead he cast the impeachment fight in simpler basic terms \u2014 a battle between him and the swamp.\n\n\u201cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey want to erase your voice, and they want to erase your future.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country.\u201d\n\nBefore Trump took the stage, his son Eric warmed up the crowd with an attack on the Bidens.\n\nThe younger Trump asked the crowd for an assessment of how Hunter Biden is feeling and suggested that the familiar Trump rally chant of \u201cLock her up\u201d \u2014 directed at Hillary Clinton \u2014 become \u201cLock him up\u201d instead. The crowd then chanted, \u201cLock him up, lock him up.\u201d\n\nThe rally, scheduled before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the impeachment investigation, came at a pivotal moment for Trump. His campaign strategy is focused on motivating his core supporters, rather than trying to win over a diminishing number of undecided voters, and the resonance of his appeal to the faithful may determine his second-term chances.\n\nTrump has lashed out in acerbic tweets and public statements at Democrats, the media and even some Republicans as impeachment has dominated the national headlines. He has claimed that he is the victim of a \u201ccoup,\u201d although impeachment is a constitutional process, and accused Democrats of trying to undo the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy,\u201d Trump said, as he quoted from the letter his White House counsel wrote Tuesday to Democrats declaring the administration\u2019s refusal to cooperate in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAs polls show Americans\u2019 support for removing Trump from office has ticked up since House Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry, his GOP allies have launched a countrywide campaign to try to reverse that trend and inflict political pain on vulnerable Democrats who are supporting the House investigation.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are tuned in to the symbolism of the moment.\n\nThe rally at Target Center, the city\u2019s basketball arena, drew thousands of supporters as well as protesters outside. Trump was joined by Vice President Mike Pence, who had a separate schedule of appearances in the state Trump is trying to tip his way next year.\n\nPence told the crowd that Democrats have spent the last three years trying to \u201coverturn\u201d the 2016 result. \u201cNow, Minnesota, it\u2019s our time to fight for him,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump fell about 45,000 votes short of beating Democrat Hillary Clinton statewide in 2016. He has had staff in the state since June building a network to turn out supporters next November.\n\n\u201cWe are going to win this state,\u201d Trump said Thursday.\n\nAttacks on the \u201csocialist\u201d wing of the Democratic Party are the heart of Trump\u2019s plan to hold onto the Rust Belt and become the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972.\n\nBut the state has additional significance as the home of Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Somali-American lawmaker whom Trump often holds up as a symbol of the liberal shift in her party.\n\nTrump has tweeted that Omar should \u201cgo back\u201d to her home country if she wants to criticize the United States, and Trump supporters broke into chants of \u201cSend her back!\u201d at a rally this summer in North Carolina. Both incidents drew widespread condemnation from otherwise stalwart Trump supporters, who called the chants racist and urged the president to condemn them.\n\nSome lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and some of the president\u2019s closest outside advisers privately warned Trump about the damage those chants could inflict on the GOP, according to four Republicans close to the White House who were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.\n\nThey believed the sight of thousands of mostly white attendees chanting \u201cSend her back!\u201d would dominate news coverage and turn off moderate voters, particularly women and suburban residents.\n\nThe chant did not recur at the Minneapolis, as the crowd chanted \u201cfour more years\u201d and \u201cUSA\u201d when Trump mentioned the lawmaker.\n\n\u201cShe is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that I\u2019m going to win and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota,\u201d he said of Omar.\n\nProtesters converged on the arena hours before Trump\u2019s appearance, eventually packing the streets surrounding it. Many blew brightly colored whistles handed out by fellow protesters, adding to the din of frequent chants like, \u201cLock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!\u201d \u2014 referring to Trump himself. Some clutched helium-filled balloons depicting Trump as a baby, similar to the famed Baby Trump balloon that flew above a nearby building.\n\nLora Torgerson of suburban Inver Grove Heights clutched a sign that read \u201cLiar Liar Diaper on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a registered GOP member, and I\u2019ve never been more ashamed of our party,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him.\u201d\n\nInside the arena, Lori Glass, a longtime Republican from White Bear Lake, a Twin Cities suburb, dismissed the talking of impeachment with one word: \u201cRidiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done so much for the country,\u201d she said, citing the economy as Trump\u2019s top accomplishment. Democrats are pressing for impeachment because \u201cthey don\u2019t have a good candidate,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Friday, Trump planned a rally in Louisiana against Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. Aides said Trump is not endorsing one of the GOP candidates in the race before Saturday\u2019s election to maximize the chances that Edwards falls below the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff.\n\nNext week Trump is set to hold a rally in Dallas, a GOP stronghold in a state that has grown more competitive for Democrats in recent cycles.\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.
