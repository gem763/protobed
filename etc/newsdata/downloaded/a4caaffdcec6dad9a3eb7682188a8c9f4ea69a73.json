Bernie Sanders (I-VT) participated in a criminal justice forum at Benedict College on Saturday and told a black male student \u2014 who asked for advice on how to handle an interaction with a police officer \u2014 to \u201crespect what they [police officers] are doing so that you don\u2019t get shot in the back of the head.\u201d\n\nSanders participated in the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at the historically black college on Saturday and took a question from an audience member, who asked, \u201cIf I was your son, what advice would you give me the next time I would be pulled over by a police officer?\u201d\n\nThe presidential hopeful told the student that he would suggest politely asking for the officer\u2019s name and stressed respecting what the officer is doing \u201cso that you don\u2019t get shot in the back of the head.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would do my best to identify who that police officer is in a polite way, ask him or her for their name,\u201d Sanders began.\n\n\u201cI would respect what they are doing so that you don\u2019t get shot in the back of the head, but I would also be very mindful of the fact that, as a nation, we have got to hold police officers accountable for the actions that they commit,\u201d he continued, urging his hypothetical son to exercise caution.\n\n\u201cSo, to answer your question, I would be very cautious if you were my son in terms of dealing with our police officers, but I would also defend my rights and know my rights and make sure, if possible, that police officer\u2019s [body] camera is on,\u201d he added:\n\n.@BernieSanders to black student on how to handle getting pulled over by the police: \u201cIdentify who the police officer is \u2013 respect what they are doing so that you don\u2019t get shot in the back of the head.\u201d pic.twitter.com/MND84NELLL \u2014 chris evans (@notcapnamerica) October 26, 2019\n\nMany on social media were not pleased by Sanders\u2019 answer.\n\n\u201cLord, @TheDemocrats are in real trouble. They NEED the Black vote in both elections,\u201d one user wrote.\n\n\u201cShowing an officer \u2018respect\u2019 still regularly gets Black people killed because racism,\u201d another tweeted.\n\n\u201cOooohhhhh, so all those victims of police shootings were\u2026 just asking for it\u2026 Gotcha,\u201d another added.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden (D) was presented with a similar question.\n\n\u201cIf I were your daughter, what advice would you give me the next time I am stopped by police?\u201d a young black woman asked.\n\n\u201cIf you were my daughter, you would be a Caucasian girl and you wouldn\u2019t be pulled over,\u201d Biden said to applause.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal. What I would tell you is that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong. That is what\u2019s wrong. There is institutional racism that still exists,\u201d he added:\n\nInstitutional racism should no longer exist. As president, I'll put forward change to help put an end to it. pic.twitter.com/DQtPzGIfNq \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 27, 2019\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also attended the event, despite pledging to skip it the day prior due to the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center\u2019s recognition of President Trump.\n\nColumbia Mayor Steve Benjamin (D) assured candidates that the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center had nothing to do with the event, which prompted Harris\u2019s reversal.\n\n\u201cI am excited to welcome presidential candidates to a criminal justice forum dialogue which will allow Benedict College students and the wider community to have full participation,\u201d Benjamin said.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear that the Candidate Forums are hosted by myself and Benedict College. This portion of the weekend is not a 20/20 Presidential Justice Center event,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite that, the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center \u201cmaintained a presence there throughout the day,\u201d the Washington Post reported, even tweeting images from Harris\u2019s discussion:", "description": "Sanders told a male black student to \"respect what they [police officers] are doing so that you don\u2019t get shot in the back of the head.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Bernie-Sanders-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
