I\u2019d been feeling sorry for myself, complaining of an aching wrist and back \u2013 the vestiges of an age-inappropriate roller skating accident - while my massage therapist Elisa worked to soothe my pain.\n\nEventually, our conversation turned to her friend Stephen. At only 41, just months after marrying the love of his life, Stephen had gone to the doctor complaining of stomach pains and the inability to keep anything down. He reemerged with a diagnosis: stage-3 pancreatic cancer, inoperable due to a very large tumor wrapping itself around a major artery in his abdomen.\n\nIn essence, a death sentence.\n\nElisa had been buying Stephen sublingual CBD oil \u2013 $89 for one ounce \u2013 because it proved to be the only thing effectively alleviating the tingling and numbness that had recently consumed his fingers and toes. He and his husband Wade\u2019s savings had been bled dry by their $2,400 per month insurance premium plus general expenses. Stephen is unable to work since his life has become a blur of excruciating pain, treatments, hope, fear, and heavy doses of opioids like fentanyl and oxycodone.\n\nStephen first heard about the reported pain relief benefits of medical marijuana and CBD oil for cancer patients a year into his treatment. When he asked his doctors about applying for a medical marijuana card, their reluctance confused him. Still, he persisted and when he started using both, he found they controlled his symptoms as well or, in some cases, better than opioids. He also found out that no insurance company covers their high costs.\n\nAs Elisa told me Stephen\u2019s story, I considered how the small discomforts I\u2019d come in with made it harder for me to get around in the day or to sleep well at night. How they made me feel irritable and fragile. And how I could pay a negligible amount of money to a lovely woman to help soothe them for me. My ailments were absolutely nothing by comparison to Stephen\u2019s, yet what he needs is elusive at best, prohibited at worst.\n\nPoliticians have been embroiled in contentious debates for years about the morality and logistics of legalizing medical marijuana despite reputable studies, like the RAND study, which supports its efficacy. In the meantime, people like Stephen suffer.\n\nI decided to document Stephen\u2019s life because his story had something valuable to remind us all about the gap between the abstract moralizing of politicians and the needs of the people they represent.\n\nThese pictures were taken between January and August 2019.\n\nWade is a freelance hairstylist. Once in a while, he sits Stephen down in the chair in his home salon and treats him to a haircut, shave and facial mask.\n\nStephen remembers clearly what it felt like to be diagnosed: \u201cIt just hits you like a ton of bricks: \u2018Everything is about to change.\u2019 Your life is going to be about doing chemo, radiation, things you wouldn\u2019t normally do and it\u2019s going to be a hard, uphill battle.\u201d\n\nWade adds Osmolite formula, a therapeutic nutrition for patients with increased calorie and protein needs, to a drip every other night to help Stephen maintain a healthy weight. The procedure takes eight hours and is very uncomfortable. Lack of appetite and nausea leading to unhealthy weight loss are common for pancreatic patients. The use of medical marijuana has helped Stephen greatly with these symptoms.\n\nArtist Jason Naylor, whose self described mission is to \u201cspread color and positivity across the globe,\u201d heard about Stephen\u2019s plight through social media and made him the \u201cLove\u201d painting, which he hand delivered to the couple, that hangs above Stephen and Wade\u2019s bed.\n\nOverwhelmed by medical expenses, Stephen and Wade accepted the offer of a friend to set up a GoFundMe page for them.\n\n\u201cWe have to lean on each other, trust one another, and be up front about how we\u2019re doing and feeling every single day,\u201d Stephen says of his relationship. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would have been able to get through this diagnosis without Wade. I appreciate him more every day. I know that sounds corny, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nClyde, one of the couple\u2019s two cats, the other is Bonnie (both male), watches as Stephen tries on his kickboxing gloves. Kickboxing was something Stephen enjoyed with friends before his diagnoses when he was 40 pounds heavier. Now, there are some days he\u2019s too weak to get out of bed.\n\nStephen describes the current state of his disease; \u201cStage 3-pancreatic cancer without the possibility of the Whipple procedure because of the placement of the tumor. They do a CT scan every three months and determine the next steps based on those results. A very risky surgery \u2013 I believe it\u2019s only performed by one doctor in the US at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota \u2013 is my only option and we\u2019re hoping to make that happen. But insurance has, so far, refused to pay for it or the chemotherapy I\u2019ll need beforehand, and it is astronomically expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me smile a little to wear fun, colorful socks,\u201d Stephen says in reference to the \u201ccock socks\u201d he wears to physical therapy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s funny,\u201d Stephen remarks, \u201cthat in America you\u2019re able to buy alcohol, which is known to cause all these problems, but CBD oil and medical marijuana are more regulated and looked down upon. It\u2019s sad because they\u2019ve definitely helped me immensely.\u201d\n\nIn New York State, medication comes primarily in the form of pills, vapes, oils and lotions. Dispensaries can\u2019t distribute edibles because it\u2019s much harder to control the doses a patient receives in them. Every dose at Columbia Care New York is consistent and titrated, meaning it\u2019s increased, if need be, slowly over time.\n\nTricia Reed, PharmD, Columbia Care New York\u2019s lead pharmacist, describes the purported benefits of some of their products.\n\n\u201cHigh THC products are good for nausea, vomiting, and severe pain, giving more of an opiate-type pain relief. THC is a good muscle relaxer and helps with sleep. CBD is a great anti- inflammatory, works well for nerve pain, and is an anti-convulsant so it\u2019s good for seizures.\n\nEvery dose has to deliver the exact milligram per milliliter as prescribed. Each time you take an inhalation from the vapor, it gives you a specific mg.\u201d\n\nWhen a patient visits Columbia Care for the first time, they meet with a pharmacist who takes them through a full consultation to determine what products they may respond to best.\n\n\u201cIn the higher THC products,\u201d Reed explains, \u201cthere can be a euphoric feeling which might not be so bad for patients going through a hard time. It\u2019s similar to the side effects you\u2019d get from other meds like Valium. I encourage patients to think of it that way. It\u2019s just a side effect similar to those of other medications they may have already taken. There is still that sense of taboo or stigma that goes along with marijuana. A lot of what we\u2019ve been trying to do is to de-stigmatize it.\n\nRosemary Mazanet, an oncologist by original training, is chief scientific officer for Columbia Care. \u201cWhen I think about the disconnect between the enormous promise that cannabis products bring and the fact that there\u2019s such an air about it that makes it tawdry, it comes down to the fact that it\u2019s federally illegal.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cIn the state of Massachusetts, where I live, the Massachusetts Medical Society sent a letter to doctors stating that they could recommend cannabis when it was made legal there, but that they were at risk for losing their license. \u2018We don\u2019t know what will happen, but the federal government may take action\u2019, the letter essentially said. We do know that physicians at any hospital that\u2019s federally funded will be terminated if they recommend medical marijuana to a patient. That\u2019s made physicians understandably very reluctant. I do get angry because this should be easy and it\u2019s not. We need to fix it!\u201d\n\n\u201cCancer is a mind fuck,\u201d Wade says. \u201cYou\u2019re hit with devastating and debilitating news that your loved one\u2019s life has an expiration date and you realize your own powerlessness and that begins to take its toll on your spirit. All you can do is try to remember that love is the greatest gift you can give anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day is a waiting game, praying for the best,\u201d Stephen muses. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary, but I try to remain positive and think that if the tumor does grow, I\u2019ll just have to fight it and try to remain strong. I have no other choice.\u201d", "description": "A year into his cancer treatment, Stephen heard about the benefits of medical marijuana and CBD oil, but it has proven difficult to get.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c87d26d5dc122b7d08b3bb401bf0b9f634958d4/0_131_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05266e4cc360318525db17969db9521c"}
