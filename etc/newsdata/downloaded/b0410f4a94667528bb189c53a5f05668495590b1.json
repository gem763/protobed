REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo\n\nAMS\u2019 supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Friday to explore the options, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter. Spokespeople for AMS and Osram declined to comment.\n\nAMS\u2019s 4.5 billion euro ($5 billion) takeover offer for Osram fell through earlier this month, but the group said it would still explore strategic options to pursue an acquisition of the German lighting group after securing a nearly 20% stake.\n\nAMS had sweetened its bid to 41 euros a share after private equity groups Bain Capital and Advent said that they were prepared to trump the Austrian group\u2019s original offer of 38.50 euros.\n\nOsram Chief Executive Olaf Berlien said after the failed attempt he was open to a potential new offer from the Austrian group at the right terms.\n\nAMS wants to form a global leader in sensors and lighting with a special focus on package solutions for self-driving cars.\n\nTo succeed with a potential new bid, AMS might have to increase the offer price a second time and lower the previous threshold of 62.5% needed to clinch the deal. It might also have to overcome considerable opposition from Osram labor representatives and management.\n\nOsram chief Berlien had recommended the first bid as \u201cfinancially attractive\u201d to shareholders but did not tender his own shares.\n\nAMS is due to report third-quarter results next Tuesday.\n\nAMS shares fell as much as 4.9% to 42.60 Swiss francs. Osram stock was up 1.5% at 39.56 euros at 0728 GMT.", "description": "Shares in AMS fell nearly 5% on Friday after Bloomberg reported the Austrian sensor maker was planning to discuss a renewed bid for Osram following the failure of its first attempt.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442210034&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0LV", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
