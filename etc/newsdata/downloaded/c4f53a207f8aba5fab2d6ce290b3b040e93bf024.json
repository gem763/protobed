Mat started chucking things on the ute tray like our passports and I grabbed the dogs.\n\n'As we pulled out of the property onto the laneway, the fire was just 100m away. It was really scary, absolutely terrifying.'\n\nThe couple had just hit the main road when a message was broadcast saying it was too late to evacuate - they had got out just in time.\n\nAs they drove away, fire raged through the area, taking homes, livestock and cars.\n\n'There were families on the side of the road [on Tuesday], who had lost everything and they didn't know where to go,' Ms Lillywhite said.\n\n'We heard of people who didn't have time to get their animals off the property - they just had to open the gates and hope.\n\n'Our next door neighbour had tried to leave with her children, but the fire had already cut off their property, so they had to go back and fight for their house.\n\n'We lost everything, we literally got out with the clothes on our back.'\n\nMs Lillywhite and Mr Weir had only moments to get out before they were trapped, so all they could grab was their two dogs and small things like their passports\n\nWhen they returned home the next morning, Ms Lillywhite said smoke and fire was still spewing from the trees, as they came crashing down around them\n\nThe couple fled in Mr Weir's ute, leaving Ms Lillywhite's car behind (pictured)\n\nThe couple are now fundraising to rebuild their lives, as they both work for themselves, and lost equipment necessary for them to work in the fire\n\nMs Lillywhite and Mr Weir headed to her mum's house in Ballina, where they spent a sleepless night thinking of the family photographs and precious mementos they had lost.\n\nThe couple raced back to their home on Wednesday morning to see if anything could be salvaged, and were left devastated by what they saw.\n\n'The ground was thick with white ash, and the trees were burning like volcanoes, spewing fire out the top of them,' Ms Lillywhite said.\n\n'Every 10 minutes or so, you'd hear this creaking and then a bang. It was just trees going down.\n\n'I'm just rattled, I'm just in shock, it doesn't feel real. Every time you get in the car and try to go home it hits again - it's all gone. We don't have a home.'\n\nAn even bigger problem is both Mr Weir, a painter, and Ms Lillywhite, a cheesemaker, work for themselves - and all of the equipment they need to work was taken by the fire.\n\n'Not only has it taken our home, it's taken our ability to make money, to rebuild,' she said.\n\nHer family have launched a GoFundMe for the couple, to help them purchase equipment they need for work, as well as other life essentials.\n\nMs Lillywhite and Mr Weir have been living in their beloved caravan (pictured) for two years as they saved to buy their plot of land\n\nThe couple restored the interior of the caravan, building everything themselves, and are devastated to have lost it\n\nThe oven could be seen on top of the rubble pile where the remains of the caravan lay on Wednesday morning\n\nMs Lillywhite said she was immensely grateful to the local community, who had rallied around her and her partner in their time of desperate need\n\nMs Lillywhite said while the experience has been devastating, she and her fiance were able to put a positive spin on things.\n\n'We were just about to build [our home] - there is a silver lining in that we hadn't put anything on the ground yet,' she said.\n\nShe said the community had rallied around her and Mr Weir, with an op-shop in Ballina donating bags of clothes to the couple, a nearby publican donating a few free beers, and locals all jumping in to help those affected.\n\nAs the fire burned, locals were running to their neighbour's homes, making sure they got out in time, or had a plan in place to stay.\n\nIn the aftermath, everyone was checked in on, with locals ensuring everyone had accommodation and food.\n\nAs she sat in the pub, Ms Lillywhite said a woman told her: 'Australians show their best side when it comes to disaster, it brings out the best in everyone.'\n\nShe and Mr Weir are now working to rebuild. The couple are looking for a caravan to live in while they clear the ash off their land and start their lives again.", "description": "Hannah Lillywhite was living her 'dream life', until an out of control bushfire raged through the Northern Rivers property she and her fiance had moved onto just weeks earlier, taking everything they owned.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/01/19518142-0-image-a-20_1570666750113.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
