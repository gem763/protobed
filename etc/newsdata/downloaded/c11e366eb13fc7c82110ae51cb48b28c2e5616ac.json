They may look at him again when Lille travel to Marseille this weekend.\n\nGabriel, 21, played the full 90 minutes as his team won 3-0 to consolidate their impressive start to the campaign, which sees them third in the table with 18 points from 11 matches. Like Boly, he is a physically strong player who is comfortable on the ball.\n\nWolves are considering a January move for Lille's Brazilian defender Gabriel Magalhaes\n\nThe 21-year-old has impressed after establishing himself as a regular starter this season\n\nMagalhaes has operated in both a back three and a back four for Lille this season\n\nWolves are on the look out for a replacement for Willy Boly who fractured his ankle in training\n\nWith Boly out of action at least until the New Year, Wolves' need for a quality centre-back is even more urgent - they were already looking to sign one in January, even before Boly fractured his left ankle in training last Saturday.\n\nGabriel is under contract at Lille until the end of next season and has only become a first choice starter this term. He is usually part of a four-man defence but Lille switched to a back three - Wolves' favoured defensive formation - for the Bordeaux fixture.\n\nGabriel Magalhaes: Stats Age: 21 Nationality: Brazilian Club: Lille Appearances: 11 Goals: 0\n\nWhile Lille are in a stronger position than a year ago after selling Nicolas Pepe to Arsenal in a deal that could be worth \u00a372million, they are still rebuilding their finances following the difficulties of the last two seasons.\n\nHe has yet to earn a senior cap for Brazil but has been capped four times at Under-20 level. Before making his breakthrough at Lille this term, Gabriel had loan spells at Troyes and Dinamo Zagreb, after he joined the club from Brazilian club Avai in January 2017.", "description": "Wolves are considering a move for Brazilian defender Gabriel Magalhaes as they seek defensive reinforcements following an injury to Willy Boly, which will keep him out until New Year.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/12/20373848-0-image-a-51_1572438267085.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
