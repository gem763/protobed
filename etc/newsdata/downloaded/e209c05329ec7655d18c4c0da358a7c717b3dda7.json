President Trump has called Teigen a \u201cboring\u201d singer and \u201cfilthy mouthed,\u201d while Teigen called him a \u201cpussy ass bitch.\u201d\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cWe know this president has a particular aversion to strong women coming after him, particularly women of color,\u201d singer John Legend told the magazine.\n\n\u201cSo he called her out. Every time he does something like his, he just makes himself look more terrible. I don\u2019t know that that incrementally convinces anyone not to vote for him, but he just proves himself to be a shitty human being every day.\u201d\n\nLegend also said: \u201cThe biggest issue about this presidency is how they\u2019ve just lowered standards for everything. Hopefully we\u2019ll reset?\u201d\n\nTeigen said that Trump supporters are all bigots.\n\nThe magazine said that the former model struggles with anxiety but is still able to dunk on the president and his base of supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t care about pissing off a bunch of bigots,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pair campaign for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 president election.\n\nIn the interview, Legend discussed his friendship with rapper Kanye West, who is a Trump supporter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he knows one way or another what policies of Trump\u2019s he likes. He just kind of embraced Trump\u2019s blow-it-all up spirit and the energy of himself being countercultural in support him.\u201d\n\nTeigen and Legend told Vanity Fair that the impeachment proceedings against President Trump aren\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cI think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,\u201d Teigen said. \u201cI feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office. I know that his first tweet after he\u2019s impeached will be, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to be there anyway.'\u201d\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
