Gavin Newsom Signs Law That Could Upend Uber, Lyft", "language": "en", "text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed legislation on Wednesday that will reclassify many gig economy workers from independent contractors to employees, a change that could upend the business models of tech companies like Uber and Lyft.\n\nIn a letter to California lawmakers on the bill signing, Newsom called Assembly Bill 5 \u201clandmark legislation for workers and our economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will help reduce worker misclassification \u2015 workers being wrongly classified as \u2018independent contractors,\u2019 rather than employees, which erodes basic worker protections like the minimum wage,\u201d Newsom wrote, adding that the bill is an \u201cimportant step\u201d toward fighting against the \u201chollowing out of our middle class.\u201d\n\nThe new law, which is set to go into effect in January, clarifies the conditions under which a worker should be considered an employee entitled to such benefits as a minimum wage, unemployment and disability insurance, and a right to form a union.\n\n\u201cThe misclassification of workers as independent contractors has been a significant factor in the erosion of the middle class and the rise in income inequality,\u201d the new law says.\n\nUber and Lyft, whose hundreds of thousands of drivers are currently considered independent contractors, had lobbied against the measure. The companies\u2019 bottom lines will be dramatically affected if thousands of drivers are reclassified as employees.\n\nThe law applies an \u201cABC\u201d test under which workers can be considered independent contractors only if (A) the workers are \u201cfree from the control and direction\u201d of the company that hired them, (B) their work falls outside the usual business of the company and (C) they are engaged in work in an independent business of the same type as the company\u2019s.\n\nUber has claimed that its drivers \u201cpass\u201d that test and can still be considered independent contractors.\n\nExactly how the law will affect ride-hailing companies and their drivers when applied in practice is still unclear. In early September, as AB5 was expected to soon become law, Uber said that it was pursuing \u201cseveral legal and political options,\u201d including a statewide ballot initiative in 2020, to keep from having to classify its drivers as employees.\n\nThe law has exemptions for certain groups of workers, including real estate agents, freelance writers, hairstylists and barbers who set their own rates and hours.\n\nHundreds of Uber and Lyft drivers with the organizing group Gig Workers Rising protested throughout California in August, pushing for the bill\u2019s passage.\n\nThe legislation overwhelmingly passed the California Senate in early September and in the Assembly in May.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates came out in support of the bill and workers\u2019 demands in recent months, including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cAmerican history is full of shameful examples where powerful industries exploited workers in pursuit of greater profits,\u201d Warren wrote in an op-ed in the Sacramento Bee in August. \u201cIn many industries today, it takes the form of worker misclassification.\u201d", "description": "The law could transform the gig economy by requiring some companies to reclassify independent contractors as employees and provide added benefits.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6844112500004b04746870.jpeg?cache=h0zkvtnc9x&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
