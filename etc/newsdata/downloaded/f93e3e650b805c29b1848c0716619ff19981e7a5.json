USA TODAY\n\nNick Bosa didn't forget.\n\nThe former Ohio State and current San Francisco 49ers defensive end seems to hold a grudge. After Bosa sacked Baker Mayfield at the end of the first half in Monday night's win over the Browns, the rookie - who was the second overall pick in the draft - celebrated by pretending to wave and plant a flag in the Cleveland Browns' offensive backfield.\n\nOh yes, it's a reference to Mayfield's flag-planting antics at Oklahoma.\n\nMayfield quarterbacked a Sooners team that upset Bosa's Buckeyes, 31-16, on the road in 2017. After the win, Mayfield grabbed an Oklahoma flag and planted it in the middle of the field at Ohio Stadium. Bosa sacked Mayfield once during that game, but the quarterback finished with 386 yard and three touchdowns.\n\nMayfield would eventually be the No. 1 overall pick in 2018, and Bosa would go on to be the No. 2 overall pick in 2019.\n\nWith his first crack at Mayfield in the pros, Bosa recorded two sacks and recovered a fumble, and had one memorable celebration to boot:\n\nIn case you haven't seen it, here's the original planting of the flag:\n\nBaker Mayfield just did that. pic.twitter.com/Qo2Aw1pPE8 \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 10, 2017\n\nBosa then planted a literal flag after the game (though the game was at the Niners' own Levi's Stadium).\n\nBosa with the epic troll of Baker after the win \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/e0eRB6smze \u2014 49ers on NBCS (@NBCS49ers) October 8, 2019\n\n\"Good for him, good play, Mayfield said postgame.\n\nWell played, Bosa.", "description": "Nick Bosa, a former Ohio State player, sacked Baker Mayfield, a former Oklahoma player, and celebrated by drawing on an infamous Mayfield moment.", "authors": ["Henry Mckenna", "For The Win", "Published A.M.
