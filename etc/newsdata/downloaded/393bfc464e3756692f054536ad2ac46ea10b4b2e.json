Estonia is a NATO member, and with more than 1,000 alliance troops now permanently based there to deter potential Russian aggression, I had dark visions of tanks and electric fences and heavily armed border guards bristling with suspicion: a Checkpoint Charlie from the darkest days of the Cold War.\n\nBut the border in southern Estonia near the ancient Russian city of Pskov was a lot more relaxed than my paranoid imagination. It\u2019s just a few aluminum sheds bisecting a gorgeous valley lined with birch and Christmas trees.\n\nStill, as an American citizen driving an Estonian car and with numerous Ukrainian stamps in my passport from having worked as a journalist in Kyiv, it was inevitable that suspicions would be aroused.\n\nI was interviewed in a private room by one of the border guards \u2014 a clone of the young officer from the Russia-Ukraine border a year ago, with his buzz cut, tight short-sleeved shirt and wary expression. He was friendly but demanded to know what I had been doing in Ukraine. Admitting that I had been a journalist there didn\u2019t help allay his misgivings. I understood his predicament: Ukraine, Estonia and the United States are all adversaries of Russia. I could easily be a spy, or a provocateur, or both.\n\nFortunately, my having a valid Russian press accreditation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow left him no choice but to let me exit Russia without incident. \u201cBeware of the Estonians,\u201d he warned when stamping my passport. \u201cThey\u2019re tough on travelers coming from Russia.\u201d\n\nThe Estonians were stern and unfriendly, checking for cigarettes and vodka, but having an American passport trumped their misgivings, and I was done in no time.\n\nI hadn\u2019t been to Estonia in over five years and remembered the Russian language being frowned upon as it is in present-day Ukraine, even though a third of Estonia\u2019s 1.5 million citizens are Russian speakers. So, I was surprised when everyone was relaxed and speaking Russian at the Shell gas station. It was the same when I arrived in the capital, Tallinn a few hours later: The blond Estonian receptionist at the hotel spoke fluent Russian to some guests from St. Petersburg, and the menus were in both Russian and Estonian.\n\nEven my Estonian friends were enthused about the new openness toward Russian-Estonians and the Russian language. \u201cI just finished filming a Russian-language TV show set in eastern Estonia,\u201d announced Ken Saan, a friend and Estonian television producer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a hit on Estonian television.\u201d\n\nSaan admitted that Estonians are now far more accepting of the Russian language, and of the Russian-Estonians in their midst. \u201cEstonians now even go to Narva (a city on the Russian border where a majority are ethnic Russians) for a cultural weekend.\u201d He talked about Vaba Laba, a cutting-edge theater venue in the city that was recently opened in an abandoned Soviet factory.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Estonian hipsters, however, heading to the country\u2019s most Russian city for some theater. The progressive Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid moved her offices to Narva for a few weeks last year to bring more national awareness to the troubled city. \u201cThe area will thus get more attention and help break through some of the stereotypes some people still have about Narva,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe Estonians looked at the Russians and decided they weren\u2019t that different after all. They\u2019re both white and Christian\u201d \u2014 American resident in Estonia\n\nThe Estonian President also faced criticism for meeting with Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last spring \u2014 the first Baltic president to meet with him since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. She brushed off her critics, declaring in Moscow that \u201cneighbors should talk, even if we have certain disagreements.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, Estonia feels like an alternative-history TV show, where French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s hopes for a reset with Russia have already happened (the French leader called in August for the relationship to be \u201cprofoundly reinvented\u201d). Even the mayor of Estonia\u2019s capital Tallinn, Mikhail Kolvart, is an ethnic Russian \u2014 though he does speak fluent Estonian. And while Ukraine has banned most Russian television and media, Estonia has no restrictions on Kremlin media, and even has a flourishing Russian-language publishing industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their common fear of Muslim immigrants,\u201d said an American friend resident in Estonia. \u201cThe Estonians looked at the Russians and decided they weren\u2019t that different after all. They\u2019re both white and Christian.\u201d\n\nWith a far-right, nationalist and anti-immigrant Conservative People\u2019s Party having entered government last year (its Cabinet members made news by flashing \u201cwhite power\u201d salutes while being signed in), my friend\u2019s analysis might not be far from the truth. Estonia has accepted just 200 refugees under the EU\u2019s resettlement plan, and public opinion is fiercely opposed to more immigration.\n\nBut the real reason for the newfound warmth between Estonian and Russian speakers is the war in eastern Ukraine. Estonians realized that unless they integrate their Russian speakers, their dissatisfaction might turn them into a fifth column and give the Kremlin an excuse to attack their country.\n\n\u201cThe Ukraine conflict acted as a wake-up call,\u201d said Kristi Raik, director of the Estonian Foreign Policy Institute at the International Center for Defense and Security in Tallinn, in an interview with Deutsche Welle. It helped focus the nation\u2019s attention on the issue of Russian speakers\u2019 loyalty, she said, adding: \u201cDo they feel at home here? Do they feel loyal to the Estonian state?\u201d\n\nWhile neighboring Lithuania distributes pamphlets with instructions for dealing with an armed invasion from Russia, Estonians are a lot less spooked these days. Once the most hawkish of the Baltic states in their dealings with Russia, Estonia is now the region\u2019s dove.\n\nEstonia, where citizens can vote and file their taxes on their mobile phones, has always been hailed as the most advanced and tech-savvy of the Eastern European nations. Politicians and think tanks have long studied its example for clues on how to successfully transition from post-communist dystopia and compete in a market economy.\n\nIs Estonia again ahead of the curve in its embrace of its Russian speakers, and non-confrontational stance with Russia?\n\nThough Poland just negotiated with Trump for the addition of 1,000 more American troops to beef up its NATO defenses there, it might be an outlier. Neighboring Hungary, under its President Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and some in the Czech Republic, have been cozying up to Putin\u2019s Russia for years.\n\nEven Ukraine, which is on the frontline of the war with Russia, is moving from confrontation to dialogue under its new President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The comedian-turned-politician recently negotiated a high-profile prisoner swap with the Kremlin, and controversially wants Ukrainian media to broadcast in Russian into the war-torn Donbas to win back the hearts and minds of its residents.\n\nWhile his hard-line predecessor Petro Poroshenko pushed for a military solution to the conflict with Russia, Zelenskiy correctly realizes that Ukraine also needs to win back the allegiance of the region\u2019s traumatized, Russian-speaking residents. He has resumed paying pensions to residents there and wants Ukrainian products back in its stores.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia have now signaled their willingness to accept Macron\u2019s initiative and attend peace talks in Paris soon to breathe life back into the stalled Minsk Agreement.\n\nEstonia celebrated a hundred years of the founding of its republic last year, and now feels confident enough in its statehood to accept the Russians in its midst and open a dialogue with Moscow. Macron\u2019s stark warning that unless Europe explores ways of \u201cconvergence with Russia \u2026 Europe will remain the scene of a strategic battle between the United States and Russia\u201d clearly resonates with many in the country.\n\nWhether his message also resonates with Russia\u2019s more paranoid Eastern European neighbors also depends on Putin\u2019s next move. Is Russia serious in withdrawing its troops from east Ukraine and bringing about peace there, so that it can rejoin the G8 and the global community? Given Putin\u2019s growing unpopularity at home and the growing strains on its weak economy by Western sanctions, he might no longer have a choice.\n\nLike with other things in the past, Estonians seems to have figured that out much earlier than their neighbors.\n\nVijai Maheshwari is a writer and entrepreneur based in Moscow.
