The remaining three passengers were left in critical conditions, authorities said, and taken to a nearby hospital.\n\nThe crash took place Wednesday morning west of the Capital Region Airport, Clinton County Sheriff Larry Jerue said in a press conference, and was traveling from the Indy South Greenwood Airport in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\n\u201cI can at this point tell you it\u2019s a very active, investigative scene. It\u2019s still ongoing,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe plane was carrying a pilot, co-pilot and four passengers, the Lansing State Journal reported. Wednesday\u2019s crash marks Lansing\u2019s deadliest, according to the outlet, as the second-most deadly occurred in 1993 and killed two people.\n\n\u201cWe have three confirmed deaths on board, three others have been transported in critical condition to Sparrow Hospital,\u201d Jerue continued. ABC13 reported later Wednesday afternoon that one of those taken to the hospital was declared stable.\n\n\u201cAt this point, there should be no speculation as to why [the plane crashed]. We\u2019re going to continue to treat it as an active crime scene,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe airport\u2019s chief of public safety and operations Eric Patrick told USA Today that the airport received an emergency alert from the plane, but it was unclear whether or not the alert was sent before or after the crash.\n\nRELATED: Runaway Catering Cart Nearly Hits Plane on Tarmac but American Airlines Employee Saves the Day\n\n\u201cIt appears to be a very hard impact,\u201d Patrick told the outlet, while also revealing that there was no fire and the plane was mostly intact when response teams arrived on the scene, an open field near airport property.\n\n\u201cFAA investigators are on their way to the accident site, and the National Transportation Safety Board has been notified. The NTSB will be in charge of the investigation,\u201d the FAA said in a statement to CNN.", "description": "Small Plane Crashes Near Michigan Airport Leaves 3 Dead", "authors": ["Ashley Boucher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0WD4NKgcCy_iB3LtdKUHMA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/d87abbacf0d5d5841986dfa34d3bbbf8", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
