With the Nationals back in the playoffs for the first time since that wild ride, and fresh off their own breakthrough, it\u2019s hard to avoid comparing the teams again, especially considering their ongoing love affair.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about this year that\u2019s different,\u201d Nationals fan Tom Lundregan told me after Washington\u2019s comeback win over the Brewers in the wild-card game. \u201cIt\u2019s the same way we thought about the Caps two years ago. You can\u2019t put your finger on it.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals advanced to the NL Championship Series for the first time in their history with a rousing, 7-3 comeback win at Dodger Stadium in the deciding Game 5 of the NLDS on Wednesday. Did Howie Kendrick\u2019s 10th-inning grand slam, which broke a 3-3 tie, not feel a bit like Capitals forward Evgeny Kuznetsov\u2019s series-clinching overtime goal against the Penguins 16 months ago? One came in extra innings, the other required overtime. They both happened on the road, against opponents responsible for previous playoff heartbreak, though of course much more so in the case of the Penguins.\n\nKendrick\u2019s slam secured the Nationals\u2019 first berth in the NLCS, while Kuznetsov\u2019s goal put Washington in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 20 years. The Capitals then knocked off another postseason nemesis, the Tampa Bay Lightning, to reach the Stanley Cup finals, while the Nationals\u2019 path to the World Series now goes through their original playoff tormentor, the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Demons Have Been Exorcised.... again\n\n\n\nNot unlike 2018 #ALLCAPS, the 2019 #Nats worked overtime to finally break through and erase years of playoff disappointments. The #Caps went on to win 8 more games en route to a title. #Nats are now 8 wins from doing the same #OnePursuit pic.twitter.com/UDyDtFqpUB \u2014 Ben Raby (@BenRaby31) October 10, 2019\n\nI said it earlier. Just stay in it. Wait for the magic to happen. This #Nats team is too similar to the #Caps of 2018. Something special. This ride ain\u2019t over yet. #STAYINTHEFIGHT \u2014 Rob Carlin (@RobCarlinNBCS) October 10, 2019\n\nVery similar parallels between the #Nats and 2017-2018 #Caps. The Nats have been getting their version of \"puck luck\" this postseason that the Caps didn't get until their Stanley Cup run. \u2014 Jake Russell (@_JakeRussell) October 10, 2019\n\n(It turns out that Wednesday\u2019s Game 5 win also had eerie echoes of the last time a Washington baseball team won a postseason series, Game 7 of the 1924 World Series against the Giants. And if you look hard enough, you can probably draw parallels between this Nationals team and the 1978 Bullets, but I digress.)\n\nThink back to the wild-card game, when the Nationals entered the eighth inning trailing the Brewers 3-1. Washington loaded the bases with a controversial hit by pitch, a broken-bat single and a walk before Juan Soto singled to right. The ball took a strange bounce under the glove of Milwaukee right fielder Trent Grisham, allowing the go-ahead run to score, and while you might not have immediately thought back to Lars Eller\u2019s fluky, double-overtime goal in Game 3 of the Capitals\u2019 first-round series against Columbus, well, others were.\n\nIn all seriousness, a lot about this Nationals team reminds me of the 2018 Capitals. (This is coming from a total baseball outsider.) \u2014 Isabelle Khurshudyan (@ikhurshudyan) October 2, 2019\n\nI love how everyone is thinking this. What does a Columbus hockey game have to do with October baseball who cares we were all thinking it or something like it https://t.co/PW5yj2TFr4 \u2014 Dan Steinberg (@dcsportsbog) October 2, 2019\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 \u201cpuck luck\u201d continued in the NLDS, when Joc Pederson\u2019s line drive with the bases loaded in Game 4 landed inches foul and the wind knocked down what appeared to be a home run by Max Muncy later in the game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn hindsight, there was at least one familiar comparison between the teams in the regular season, too. Consider Nationals Manager Dave Martinez, whose hot seat was scalding on the afternoon of May 23, when a four-game sweep at the hands of the Mets left the Nationals 12 games under .500. The Capitals didn\u2019t start quite so poorly the season they won the Stanley Cup, but questions swirled about Coach Barry Trotz\u2019s job status after his team suffered consecutive embarrassing losses at Nashville and Colorado in November. (If the Nationals continue to mirror the Capitals\u2019 title run, expect Martinez to be introduced as the manager of the division rival Phillies sometime after the World Series parade.)\n\nThe Capitals needed seven games and consecutive shutouts by Braden Holtby to eliminate the Lightning in the Eastern Conference finals. Capitals players are all aboard the Nationals\u2019 bandwagon and will no doubt be watching to see if Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg have something similar in store for the Cardinals.\n\nThe best comparison of all between the teams, though, would be how they celebrate a title.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe way they partied afterward, I think everyone in this clubhouse would love to do as well,\u201d Nationals outfielder and hockey fan Adam Eaton said of the Capitals before the wild-card game. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite hockey players, so I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to be swimming in any fountains or anything. But, hopefully, like I said, they\u2019ll inspire us to get there.\u201d\n\nIn the words of Capitals radio play-by-play man John Walton, it\u2019s okay to believe.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "It's okay to think it.
