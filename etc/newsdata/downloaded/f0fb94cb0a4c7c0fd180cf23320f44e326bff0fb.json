The cutbacks came as carriers slammed the brakes on fleet-expansion plans.\n\nWarehousing and storage businesses added 3,400 workers, meantime, as a sector that includes labor-intensive online fulfillment centers stepped up recruitment ahead of the holiday season. The Labor Department revised its earlier numbers to show warehouse operators gained 1,700 jobs in August after earlier reporting a 1,000-job increase.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nHiring expansion slowed at parcel carriers that deliver packages to homes and businesses. Courier and messenger companies added 3,600 jobs in September.\n\nOverall the U.S. gained 136,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, a 50-year-low.\n\nExpanded hiring in health care and business and professional services helped offset weakness in the industrial sector that feeds freight networks. Manufacturers lost a net 2,000 jobs, including 4,100 positions at companies that make motor vehicles and auto parts.\n\nThe weakness in the industrial sectors includes manufacturers of trucks. Orders for heavy-duty trucks fell 72% in September from the prior year, when trucking companies flush with cash from the 2018 freight boom raced to expand fleets and replace older equipment, according to research firm FTR.\n\nDaimler Trucks North America LLC this week said it would lay off about 900 workers at two North Carolina Freightliner plants. \u201cThe market is now clearly returning to normal market levels,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis levelling-off in the market requires us to adjust our production levels to meet the normalized demand and therefore reduce our current build rates and employment levels at these locations.\u201d\n\nThe trucking sector now has cut payrolls by 9,600 jobs over the past three months.\n\nTrucking companies that stepped up recruitment last year also are cutting off that hiring pipeline as freight demand softens, said Avery Vise, FTR\u2019s vice president of trucking. \u201cThey overshot things a little,\u201d he said. What\u2019s more, \u201ca lot of smaller carriers are going out of business\u2026through August we\u2019ve already lost twice as many for-hire carriers than we lost in the entire of 2018.\u201d\n\nThis week Roadrunner Transportation Systems Inc., a large Downers Grove, Ill.-based trucking company, said it plans to cut about 450 jobs, or 10% of its total workforce, as it downsizes its unprofitable Rich Logistics truckload business as part of a broader operational overhaul.\n\nLogistics employers in sectors tied more closely to retail and e-commerce are in expansion mode as they prepare for the holiday peak. The National Retail Federation expects holiday sales to rise by between 3.8% to 4.2% this year, although it warned that slowing economic growth and uncertainty over trade could erode consumer confidence.\n\nDelivery giant United Parcel Service Inc. plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers this year, and staffing agencies report demand for warehouse labor is outstripping the available supply.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "description": "Trucking company payrolls contracted last month as a manufacturing slump weighed on freight demand while logistics sectors tied to e-commerce notched modest gains.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith", "Jennifer.Smith Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-113827/social", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
