In short, survivability also depends greatly upon \u201cspeed\u201d ...and \u201cweight.\u201d As part of this, fatigue is a realistic variable. How can infantry soldiers be expected to perform with 100-percent of their abilities after hiking for five hours through mountainous terrain -- while carrying more than 100-pounds of gear.\n\nU.S. Army infantry soldiers prioritize physical fitness, but how much faster could they maneuver wearing new material that is 14-times more effective than current body armor? This goal forms the principal inspiration for a current Army Research Lab effort to engineer a new kind of lightweight armor -- intended to be 64-percent more impact resistant than steel and up to eight times lighter than current armor.\n\nScientists with the Army Research Laboratory and the University of Buffalo have begun laboratory experiments involved in restructuring microscopic materials to massively increase an ability to \u201cabsorb impact\u201d and \u201cdissipate energy,\u201d Dr Evan Runnerstrom, Program Manager, Materials Design, Army Research Office, Army Combat Capabilities Development Command\u2019s Army Research Laboratory, told Warrior in an interview.\n\nARMY SETS SIGHTS ON NEW FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY\n\nCurrent Army soldier body armor, call the Improved Outer Tactical Vest, can weigh as much as 35 pounds. Much of it is made of synthetic fibers such as Kevlar or Dyneema with either metal or ceramic trauma plates.\n\nThe new material being used is a reconfigured variation of - Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene - a plastic-like composite material known for its durability and toughness against extreme force such as hard-object penetration and explosive impact. Variants of the material are widely used in common materials such as the plastic-like milk-gallon cartons or even joint replacements such as artificial limbs in humans. Scientists define the material, called UHMWPE for short, as \u201ca linear (non-branching) semi-crystalline polymer which can be described as a two-phase composite of crystalline and amorphous phases.\u201d\n\nThe material now being tested, however, is designed to engineer a new kind of UHMWPE that is 10-to-20-times more resistant than off-the-shelf UHMWPE; this is accomplished through an elaborate scientific process designed to create \u201cmicroscopic structural variations\u201d in the composition and thickness of the material, Runnerstrom said.\n\nThese new variations are created, Runnerstrom said, by combining differently configured polymer strands into integrated \u201chard & soft\u201d material. On one side, polymer strands are both elongated and hardened together -- while the other side is engineered to be softer and amorphous. This is done to generate a specific, high-value impact.\n\nSOLDIERS USE AI TO FIRE PRECISION GRENADES, GUIDE DRONE ATTACKS\n\n\u201cOn one side the structure is still crystalline polymer. As you move through the thickness of the material, it becomes more amorphous and disordered. It becomes softer. This smooth transition between softness and hardness gives it the ability to absorb impact and dissipate energy,\u201d Runnerstrom said.\n\nOn the hardened side, long polymer are arranged together; the \u201csheets(polymer) are lined up and very well ordered,\u201d as Runnerstrom put it.\n\n\u201cThe other (soft) side becomes amorphous polymer which is not as well lined up or stiff anymore. It allows the material to dissipate energy from an impact to the material, as opposed to a material that is only stiff or only soft,\u201d Runnerstrom said.\n\nInterestingly, an essay from the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health takes up the topic addressed by Runnerstrom and reinforces his point about how altering the \u201cmechanical properties of polymer\u201d can impact how the material behaves.\n\nHOW AI CHANGES ATTACK MISSIONS FOR US FIGHTER JETS AND BOMBERS\n\n\u201cThe mechanical properties of the polymer are dependent on both its crystalline and amorphous phases. Altering either phase (i.e., changing overall crystallinity, crystalline morphology, or crosslinking the amorphous phase) can affect the mechanical behavior of the material,\u201d the essay, called \u201cUltra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene: Mechanics, Morphology, and Clinical Behavior,\u201d states.\n\nBy extension, the paper seems to also address the protective impact of \u201cstiffening\u201d or \u201chardening\u201d some of the polymer crystalline strands.\n\n\u201cWith respect to fatigue crack propagation, work has shown that increasing the crystallinity increases fatigue crack propagation resistance of UHMWPE,\u201d the essay states.\n\nThe work is being performed the ARL and research scientists at the University of Buffalo. Prof. Shenquian Ren, who leads the effort, writes that altering \u201cthermal\u201d or heat properties of UHMWPE can change its performance, further reinforcing how different polymer strands can be altered and combined to engineer more resistant materials.\n\n'FIRST-CUT-OF-STEEL' BEGINS NEW ERA IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS, SUBMARINE WARFARE\n\n\u201cThe thermal and mechanical properties of UHMWPE graded materials could be exploited for impact resistant human protection applications,\u201d Ren writes in a scientific paper in an Applied Polymer Materials journal, called \u201cFunctional Gradient Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene for Impact-Resistant Armor.\u201d\n\nThe inspiration for this UHMWPE configuration, now being pursued by Ren, can be traced to nature - clam shells and pearls in particular. Runnerstrom explained that a natural material, called Nacre for calcium carbonate, forms the smooth iridescent material found on the interior of a clam or the outer layer of pearls. It is comprised of \u201csmall individual crystal and carbonate platelets,\u201d Runnerstrom explained. The small calcium platelets are held together by a \u201cmix of proteins.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of using calcium carbonate they are using UHMWPE,\u201d he added, referring to the new effort.\n\n\u201cThe exciting thing is by using bio-inspired materials we can design the microstructure of materials that are already known and can be manipulated to give us greater performance,\u201d Runnerstrom said.\n\nNEW AIR FORCE NUCLEAR-ARMED ICBMS TO DEPLOY BY 2029\n\nOverall, the effort could be described as future-reaching Basic Research, and scientists say this material may still be five-years away. However preliminary laboratory testing shows the \u201cmaterial does not break and nothing passes through to the other side.\u201d\n\nThere has, as of yet, not been ballistic testing. Nothing has been fired at it, however, once the initial results can be tested on a larger scale, it is believed that the results will be similar to the promising initial findings discovered in the laboratory.\n\nIf ultimately proven successful, the emerging material could have a range of combat essential functions, protecting soldiers\u2019 heads, bodies, boots and even extremities.\n\nRen\u2019s research paper on the topic explains the ultimate goal of the research.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThe body armor materials have been designed for body protection by absorbing energy from deflecting the slashing, bludgeoning, and penetrating attacks under the ballistic shock,\u201d Ren writes.", "description": "Surviving direct-hit enemy bullets to the chest, stopping hot metal fragments from IED explosions and protecting heads from otherwise catastrophic combat collisions - are all known advantages of\u00a0 U.S. Army soldier body armor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/SoldierRifle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
