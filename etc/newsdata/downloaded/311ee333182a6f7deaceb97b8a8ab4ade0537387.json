More than 300 people attended today\u2019s event.\n\nEight CBD tram routes were disrupted by the protest along Swanston St and St Kilda Rd. Flinders Street was also partially closed from the Market St intersection as a result of the disruptions.\n\nThe group planned to occupy the bridge and disrupt traffic for as long as possible before police intervened. According to Extinction Rebellion, 100 members of the group were willing to be arrested for the cause.\n\nPolice later moved in a forcibly removed protesters from the area at around 3pm. The protesters occupied the area for about three hours on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\u201cPeople made the decision before the protest they were willing to get arrested, that showed their level of commitment,\u201d protester James Norman said.\u201cIt shows they are willing to take action to peacefully demand the government listens to the science.\u201d\n\nThis is the second event in Melbourne organised by the Extinction Rebellion ahead of the major international \u201cSpring Uprising\u201d protests planned for October 7.\n\nAlthough the protesters have been removed from the area, delays are expected to continue throughout the afternoon while services resume running in these areas. If possible, it\u2019s probably a good idea to hop on a train instead of the trams.\n\nIt looks like we\u2019re about to see a whole heap of protests across Australia and the rest of the world in the coming months, with groups like Extinction Rebellion prepared to go to extreme measures to make sure we all wake the fuck up about climate change.\n\nOr, you know, we could just start giving a shit about the planet.
