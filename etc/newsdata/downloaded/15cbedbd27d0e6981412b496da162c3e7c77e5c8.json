We say this because another bizarre incident about a family being bullied and rebuked for the same has surfaced, leaving everyone shocked.\n\nA family in Bengaluru chose to remain seated during the national anthem. This agitated two Kannada actors, BV Aishwarya and Arun Gowda, who started calling them \u201cPakistani terrorists\u201d. This incident was recorded, and the video has now gone viral with the actors facing severe backlash from netizens.\n\nThe video was originally shared by Kannada actress BV Aishwarya on her Facebook account. Her post read: \u201cSo yes this damn thing happened yesterday at Orion mall PVR these F****ing so called citizens of India refused to stand while the national anthem was played n we are here as the True citizens to set these Anti-Indians right. Don\u2019t You Dare (sic).\u201d\n\nHow Kannada actors heckled a family and labelled them \u201cPakistani terrorists\u201d\n\nA group of people screamed saying: \u201cAre you trying to tell me it\u2019s their choice when it's national anthem? It is definitely not their choice. I think they should be ashamed as they are standing on Indian soil. Are you a Pakistani terrorist? Look at these guys... look at their faces once again. Standing on Indian soil, not able to spare 52 seconds for the country and you have the audacity to sit here and watch a movie for three hours.\u201d\n\nWho the hell are these goons to intimidate and threaten those who do not follow their dictate on nationalism?\n\nSalute to those few people who stood their ground in front of threatening idiotic goons.pic.twitter.com/75BmveJHez \u2014 Ravi Nair (@t_d_h_nair) October 28, 2019\n\nDisgusted to see youngsters not respecting India and our national anthem ... see the resistance to stand up when being rendered in a theatre ! pic.twitter.com/6Yti6795K0 \u2014 Karuna Gopal (@KarunaGopal1) October 29, 2019\n\nIf you can\u2019t stand for just 52 seconds for National Anthem, you can never stand for India.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s good that these anti national people are exposing themselves these days.\n\n\n\nPeople make them famous pic.twitter.com/8yzUq7Lf8E \u2014 Amit Agarwal (@AmitAgarwal9) October 28, 2019\n\nResponding to that a woman from the family says: \u201cI am amazed to hear that the opposite of Indian is Pakistani.\u201d The crowd reacts saying they will file a case if they have to.\n\n\n\nSeveral other cases from Chennai and Kerala have been reported in the past\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened. Before this, several other cases from Kerala and Chennai were reported, where the police arrested moviegoers for not standing up during the national anthem following the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict. In another incident that took place in Chennai, seven people were booked by the police for disrespecting the anthem where a group of six men and one woman were taking selfies while the national anthem was playing.\n\nAmeesha Patel, too, got called out for it\n\nIn fact, even Bollywood actress Ameesha Patel, too, wasn\u2019t spared and got called out by Kushal Tandon, a former Bigg Boss contestant. Kushal had tweeted about the same, saying Ameesha was busy with her phone while others stood up for the anthem. He even shared pictures to support his tweet. The next day, Ameesha responded to his tweets reasoning out how her menstrual cramps didn\u2019t let her stand up.\n\nI waited for the film to start so I cud address my GirLY problem in the bathroom. Didn't know that kushal wud make it a national issue \u2014 ameesha patel (@ameesha_patel) October 26, 2015\n\nStanding up for the national anthem, a choice not a mandate\n\nIn November 2016, the Supreme Court made it mandatory for all movie theatres to play the national anthem before the start of the feature film. They made it a mandate for everyone present in the hall to stand up during the anthem. However, in 2017, a Supreme Court bench headed by former Chief Justice Deepak Misra scrapped the mandate. He said, \u201cPeople do not need to stand up at a cinema hall to be perceived as patriotic.\u201d Again, in January 2018, a two-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice overturned the 2016 order and gave theatres a choice whether or not to play the national anthem.\n\nWhile the debate on this needs rational thought and a thorough understanding of a citizen\u2019s rights, for now, all we know is that not standing up for the national anthem doesn\u2019t make anyone a terrorist, Pakistani or otherwise.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A video of two Kannada actors BV Aishwarya and Arun Gowda getting agitated and calling a family Pakistani terrorists, who chose to remain seated during the national anthem, has gone viral facing major flak from netizens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_Kannada-Actors-Harass-A-Family-For-Being-Seated-During-National-Anthem_Social-1_5db95e2f4beeb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
