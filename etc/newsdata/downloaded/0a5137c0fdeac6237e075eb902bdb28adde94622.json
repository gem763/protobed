Consisting of more than 1,000 islands across 26 atolls, there is a lot to choose from \u2014 too much, in fact.\n\nThe Conrad Maldives Rangali Island is unique from many other resorts in the Maldives because it's on two islands instead of one, resulting in lots of room options, privacy, and amenities.\n\nIt also has the world's first underwater restaurant and underwater residence, plus tours to see whale sharks, and a unique coral regeneration program to help rebuild its damaged house reef.\n\nThe Conrad Maldives Rangali Island is part of the Hilton family so you can use and earn points during your stay. Nightly rates for one-room overwater villas can start as low as $570 and go up to $830 during low and shoulder seasons, and range between $2,200 and max out at around $2,800 during high season.\n\nWhen searching for honeymoon spots, my husband and I decided on the Maldives because it would be the one time in our lives where we could do absolutely nothing without any responsibilities. Well, except sleep, snorkel, and get to our dinner reservation on time.\n\nMany late nights and spreadsheets later, we chose to stay at the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island. Uniquely located on two islands in the South Ari Atoll, we thought there'd be more to do and see than other resorts we looked at. But even after 10 days, we felt like we barely saw anything. Or anyone for that matter. Since everything is spread out between the main island known as Rangalifinolhu, and the second, more private Rangali Island, we only encountered other guests at restaurants or on tours.\n\nAs most of our trips tend to be pretty active and include some combination of hiking, swimming, diving, or snorkeling, we were initially hesitant about going to the Maldives where you're more limited. But we really just wanted to relax and the resort has everything we needed \u2014 restaurants, bars, tennis courts, shops, water sports, house reef, and more \u2014 and we surprisingly didn't feel bored even after 10 days.\n\nMy husband and I stayed on both islands in two different types of rooms \u2014 a Superior Water Villa on Rangali Island and a refurbished Beach Villa on Rangali Island. We went in August, which is considered part of the shoulder season for the Maldives, so our room rates were a lot cheaper than the high season. Nightly rates for one-room overwater villas in August can start as low as $570 and go up to $830, and range between $2,200 and max out at around $2,800 during high season.\n\nAs we'd come to expect though, everything in the Maldives comes with a justified premium.\n\nKeep reading to see why I was so impressed by the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island.", "description": "My husband and I spent 10 days at the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island on our honeymoon.
