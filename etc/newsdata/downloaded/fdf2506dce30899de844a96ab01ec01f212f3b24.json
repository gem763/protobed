(Image: ESA)\n\nThe European Space Agency was forced to perform a \u201ccollision avoidance manoeuvre\u201d to prevent its Aeolus spacecraft from potentially smashing into one of Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellites, in what is quickly becoming an all-too-common occurrence. According to SpaceX, it never received the expected alert that a collision was possible.\n\nESA pumped out a series of tweets Tuesday describing the incident, in which the Aeolus satellite \u201cfired its thrusters, moving it off a collision course with a @SpaceX satellite in their #Starlink constellation\u201d on Monday.\n\nLaunched in August 2018, the Aeolus Earth science satellite monitors the planet\u2019s wind from space, allowing for better weather predictions and climate modelling.\n\nFor the first time ever, ESA has performed a 'collision avoidance manoeuvre' to protect one of its satellites from colliding with a 'mega constellation'#SpaceTraffic pic.twitter.com/kmXvAgpj1U \u2014 ESA Operations (@esaoperations) September 2, 2019\n\nExperts in the ESA\u2019s Space Debris Team \u201ccalculated the risk of collision between these two active satellites,\u201d determining that the safest option for Aeolus was to increase its height and have it pass over the SpaceX satellite, according to an ESA tweet. It marked the first time the ESA had to perform \u201ca collision avoidance manoeuvre\u2019 to protect one of its satellites from colliding with a \u2018mega constellation,\u2019\u201d noted the space agency.\n\nReferring to SpaceX\u2019s Starlink as a \u201cmega constellation\u201d is a bit of a stretch at the moment, given that the system currently consists of 60 satellites. This initial batch of satellites was delivered to low Earth orbit in May aboard a Falcon 9 rocket, and it\u2019s the first of many planned deployments.\n\nSpaceX envisions a constellation consisting of hundreds and possibly thousands of interlinked Starlink satellites, which would collectively provide broadband internet to paying customers regardless of where they are in the world.\n\nBut as the ESA tweeted, as \u201cthe number of satellites in orbit increases, due to \u2018mega constellations\u2019 such as #Starlink comprising hundreds or even thousands of satellites, today\u2019s \u2018manual\u2019 collision avoidance process will become impossible...\u201d\n\nThe manoeuvre took place about 1/2 an orbit before the potential collision. Not long after the collision was expected, #Aeolus called home as usual to send back its science data \u2013 proving the manoeuvre was successful and a collision was indeed avoided pic.twitter.com/flYGDwFQ57 \u2014 ESA Operations (@esaoperations) September 2, 2019\n\nAn ESA graphic identified the culprit as being Starlink 44. The manoeuvre was done a half-Earth-orbit before Aeolus\u2019 closest approach to the Starlink satellite. Jeff Foust from SpaceNews provides more insight into the incident:\n\nHolger Krag, director of ESA\u2019s Space Safety Programme Office, said in a Sept. 3 email that the agency\u2019s conjunction assessment team noticed the potential close approach about five days in advance, using data provided by the U.S. Air Force\u2019s 18th Space Control Squadron. \u201cWe have informed SpaceX and they acknowledged,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the days the collision probability exceeded the decision threshold and we started the manoeuvre preparation and shared our plans with SpaceX. The decision to manoeuvre was then made the day before.\u201d\n\nThe odds of a collision were calculated at 1 in 1,000, which was high enough to warrant the manoeuvre. ESA scientists assessed the threat using data gathered by the U.S. Air Force, along with the \u201coperators\u2019 own knowledge of spacecraft positions,\u201d according to SpaceNews.\n\nIn a statement emailed to Gizmodo, a SpaceX spokesperson said the Starlink team \u201clast exchanged an email with the Aeolus operations team on August 28, when the probability of collision was only in the [1 in 50,000 range], well below the [1 in 10,000] industry standard threshold and 75 times lower than the final estimate.\u201d\n\nOnce the U.S. Air Force\u2019s updates showed that the probability had increased to more than 1 in 10,000, \u201ca bug in our on-call paging system prevented the Starlink operator from seeing the follow on correspondence on this probability increase,\u201d according to the spokesperson, who said \u201cSpaceX is still investigating the issue and will implement corrective actions.... had the Starlink operator seen the correspondence, we would have coordinated with ESA to determine best approach with their continuing with their manoeuvre or our performing a manoeuvre.\u201d\n\nYikes. This incident reveals the flimsy and primitive state of space traffic management, in which a failed communication led to ESA having to act unilaterally on the issue.\n\nAs for the Starlink constellation and its potential to create future risks as it grows in size, SpaceX is equipping its satellites with automated and manual collision avoidance capabilities, according to the Elon Musk-led company.\n\nSpaceX also shares position and velocity forecasts, among other data, with the U.S. Air Force and other satellite operators. The spokesperson said SpaceX is \u201camong the first to voluntarily share ephemeris tracking data with other satellite operators and the public at space-track.org.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, ESA had to perform 28 avoidance manoeuvres, reports C|net, so this isn\u2019t hugely out of the ordinary. That said, it is \u201cvery rare to perform collision avoidance manoeuvres with active satellites,\u201d according to an ESA tweet, as the \u201cvast majority of ESA avoidance manoeuvres are the result of dead satellites or fragments from previous collisions.\u201d\n\nResponding to the ESA tweets, Matt Desch, the CEO of satellite communications company Iridium, suggested this incident wasn\u2019t a big deal. \u201cHmmm,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe move our satellites on average once a week and don\u2019t put out a press release to say who we manoeuvred around...\u201d\n\nIndeed, a cynical reading suggests the ESA used this incident \u2014 which was very much a real incident \u2014 to raise awareness about the burgeoning issue of space traffic management, which it did by piggybacking off of SpaceX hype. It\u2019s worth pointing out that ESA took the opportunity to note that it\u2019s currently preparing to streamline the collision detection process with artificial intelligence.\n\nEventually, AI could be used to automate the system, from detection of a threat through to carrying out the required action. Both ESA and SpaceX are planning to use autonomous systems in the future to mitigate the risk of collisions, reports SpaceNews. Automated systems, the ESA noted, \u201care becoming necessary to protect our space infrastructure.\u201d\n\nNo doubt, it\u2019s currently the Wild West era in terms of how we\u2019re managing space traffic. Aside from preventing weapons of mass destruction from entering into space, no formal laws or treaties exist to manage the stuff that goes up into orbit nor what operators should do to prevent their satellites from smashing into other satellites.\n\nThat satellites might crash into each other may not seem like a huge deal, but aside from the loss of an important space-based asset, each collision would produce a field of orbiting debris, increasing the chances of even more collisions.\n\nJessica West, a program officer at Project Ploughshares and the managing editor of its Space Security Index, said it would be a mistake say this latest incident wasn\u2019t a big deal.\n\n\u201cYes, satellite manoeuvres happen on a regular basis,\u201d West told Gizmodo. \u201cBut just because something is business as usual doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s good business. The problem that we\u2019re facing in outer space is that the number of satellites and different operators in orbit is increasing drastically, but we don\u2019t have rules for managing this traffic. There are no industry-wide standards for who moves, when, and how.\u201d\n\nEven worse, West said there \u201cisn\u2019t even a single map of all of this traffic.\u201d Existing data remains imprecise, she said, and even though we\u2019re \u201cnot flying blind,\u201d we don\u2019t have the required tools to operate safely in the long term, she explained.\n\n\u201cSo far we have been lucky,\u201d said West. \u201cBut it only takes one collision to create a mess in low Earth orbit.\u201d", "description": "The European Space Agency was forced to perform a \u201ccollision avoidance manoeuvre\u201d  to prevent its Aeolus spacecraft from potentially smashing into one of Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellites, in what is quickly becoming an all-too-common occurrence.
