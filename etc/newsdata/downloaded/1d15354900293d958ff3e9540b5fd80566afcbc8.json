What isn\u2019t in place is the infrastructure like roads, which would usually be in place first.\n\n(Image: WalesOnline/Jon Lawrence)\n\nAsked whether they would ever be lived in, he responded: \"Our intention is that the dwellings will eventually be utilised as part of the wider scheme.\"\n\nMr Gough also said a new planning application had been submitted for the construction of 74 more homes at Coed Darcy. The plans are currently awaiting approval from Neath Port Talbot Council.\n\nLlandarcy itself was built as a model village to house the workers at the BP oil refinery and was named after the owner of the company, William Knox D'Arcy.\n\nAt its height, the refinery employed 2,600 workers, with the final buildings being torn down in 2013, starting the long process of decontaminating the land.\n\n(Image: WalesOnline/Jon Lawrence)\n\nThe process of making the area safe for people to live and work in has been a long one. St Modwen has removed 125kms of pipes and cables from the refinery site, and recovered 1.25 million litres of oil from the lakes and ponds that dot the area.\n\nThe amount of oil recovered would fill 18,000 tanks of fuel in an average sized family car.\n\nSince the process started, wildlife, trees and plants have returned to the area as it has steadily become less contaminated.\n\n(Image: WalesOnline/Jon Lawrence)\n\nHowever, local people have long questioned what is happening at the site, with some believing that the land still retains some oil.\n\n\u201cThe water around there is just gross and you can see there is still a fair amount of oil being rejected by the ground,\" said Seren Craven who is a regular walker through the woods near Coed Darcy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a fair amount of time before they consider letting them be lived in.\n\n\u201cIn the summer it looks wonderful though, nice and peaceful.\"\n\nMr Gough said the plans were \"hugely long-term because of the large quantities of oil extracted out\" and the need to protect the natural habitat at Coed Darcy.\n\n\"There is nothing wrong with the homes themselves, it's the access, we've extracted the oil and are transforming it (Coed Darcy) into new positive uses like homes and public spaces\", he added.\n\nCarl Flynn, 42, who now lives in Wrexham but worked as an operator at the bitumen plant at the refinery until 1999, said: \u201cThat was the tank farm area of the refinery (where the houses are), the area in front of those houses was the main tip and lagoons. It was a very nasty area of land.\n\n(Image: WalesOnline/Jon Lawrence)\n\n\u201cMany years ago a train used to travel around the 1000 acre site collecting all types of refinery waste and it was all dumped in that area.\u201d\n\nCoedffranc West councillor Helen Ceri Clarke said residents on the neighbouring Persimmon Homes estate had complained to her about the lack of promised development at Coed Darcy.\n\nShe said: \"People are more interested in when the schools are going to be built. They want what they were promised when they bought the homes.\n\n\"There isn't even a place to buy a bottle of milk there at the moment, although they (St Modwen) have done a lot of work cleaning up the ground to bring the site up to an acceptable, habitable standard.\"\n\n(Image: WalesOnline/Jon Lawrence)\n\nIn a section 106 agreement with Neath Port Talbot Council, a part of the planning process that ensures that negative impacts of a development are considered and balanced out, St Modwen agreed to build primary and secondary schools, a doctors surgery and shops at Coed Darcy.\n\nCouncillor Clark believed that people in the neighbouring Persimmon estate had been attracted by the lure of the schools that were yet to materialise.\n\n\"We are expecting the application for the schools to come in shortly,\" she said, adding that a huge growth might be seen at the site in the next couple of years.\n\nMr Gough insisted that in the first half of 2020 it was likely that new development would finally begin at Coed Darcy.", "description": "The houses were built on the site of the former BP oil refinery in Llandarcy, Wales, in 2013, with traditional Welsh stone and using cutting-edge construction techniques", "authors": ["John Cooper", "Image", "Walesonline Jon Lawrence"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20736512.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RBP_MAI181019village1644JPG1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
