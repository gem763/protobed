I hope others will look to it.\"\n\nLonger vision\n\nMs Lewis said the bank's previous leave policy of 10 days had been conceived in a time when the focus was on giving victims enough time to exit a dangerous situation.\n\n\"As we\u2019ve done more work and we\u2019ve worked extensively with some of our community partners, we\u2019re moving beyond the emergency response area and more to what can be a very long time to get yourself back to financial stability.\"\n\nCurrently, employers must allow for a minimum five unpaid days of domestic violence leave, while unions have been pushing for 10 to 20 days' paid leave.\n\nMs Lewis said a week was enough to find alternative accommodation but \"victim survivors\" needed to be confident they had enough leave to attend court to recover assets or negotiate child support.\n\n\"Our purpose is enhancing financial wellbeing and 90 per cent of domestic abuse cases have involved financial abuse [where a partner restricts access to money],\" Ms Lewis said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bank had seen the effects of such abuse first-hand through its customers.\n\nRecently a woman had walked into a CBA branch and sought to withdraw $70,000 because she needed to buy a car for work, Ms Lewis said.\n\nThe branch manager saw the amount was most of the customer's life savings, and after talking to her found out her new partner was persuading her to invest in a Mercedes. The customer ended up opting for a cheaper car after the manager proposed it would be a more sensible alternative.\n\nBut the bank later discovered her partner was on several apprehended violence order lists and had been a previous perpetrator of domestic violence.\n\nMs Lewis said financial abuse made it more difficult to exit a violent situation and she hoped uncapped leave would encourage more people to use the leave, not just more of it.\n\nNo fear of 'false claims'\n\nMedibank and some local councils also offer uncapped domestic violence leave but the benefit is still relatively rare.\n\nWomen's Information Referral Exchange chief executive Julie Kun said she expected more employers to back uncapped benefits following CBA's announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The hardest part is getting one to do it and then others begin to follow slowly. Whenever a significant organisation like this says yes it just adds to the snowballing effect.\"\n\nEmployers were more open to larger leave balances after their initial concerns proved unfounded, she said.\n\n\"When it first came in people thought there would be a tsunami of people wanting leave and people would be asking for 30 or 40 days, and that's not what happened,\" she said.\n\n\"The people coming forward really need it and you're not getting the false claims that maybe people were scared of happening.\"", "description": "The Commonwealth Bank has become the largest employer to back uncapped domestic violence leave in a move expected to set the standard for big corporates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3142%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_432%2C$y_209/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e1e49b190727c59bfd51aad55485bb09941b50c9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
