Shareholders of both firms seemed unenthusiastic about the potential deal when talks were announced last month, and stock in both tobacco giants was up in premarket trading Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhile we believed the creation of a new merged company had the potential to create incremental revenue and cost synergies, we could not reach agreement,\u201d said Altria CEO Howard Willard.\n\nPhilip Morris International stock (ticker: PM) was up 7.2% to $76.71, while Altria stock (MO) rose 3.4% to $42.10.\n\nThe news coincides with a shake-up at Juul Labs, which is 35% owned by Altria. CEO Kevin Burns is stepping down. He will be succeeded by K.C. Crosthwaite, who is leaving his role as chief strategy and growth officer at Altria.\n\nRegulatory pushback has been mounting against Juul Labs. The San Francisco company is seen as Altria\u2019s hedge against a cigarette-free future. But investigations and vaping-related bans at the state and local levels could have complicated merger talks.\n\nJuul said Wednesday it will suspend all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the U.S., adding it will also refrain from lobbying the Food and Drug Administration. The company has faced concern that its marketing tactics appealed to teenagers\n\nIn a statement, Crosthwaite cited the \u201cunacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence\u201d facing the vaping industry. \u201cAgainst that backdrop, we must strive to work with regulators, policy makers and other stakeholders, and earn the trust of the societies in which we operate,\u201d he said.\n\nPhilip Morris CEO Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos said in a statement that it and Altria will focus on launching the IQOS device\u2014a heat-not-burn tobacco product\u2014in the U.S. \u201cas part of their mutual interest to achieve a smoke-free future.\u201d\n\nIQOS has received pre-sale approval from the FDA, though Philip Morris has also applied for less strict regulations. Philip Morris sells IQOS overseas, while Altria will sell it in the U.S.\n\nWrite to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com", "description": "Juul Labs\u2014partly owned by Altria\u2014is changing CEOs and its approach to marketing in the U.S.", "authors": ["Connor Smith"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110644/social", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
