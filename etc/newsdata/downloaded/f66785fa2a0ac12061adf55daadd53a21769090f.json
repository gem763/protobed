The installation, titled The Nautilus, is free to the public, and is meant to serve as both a destination and an experience for visitors to the seaport throughout the summer.\n\n\u201cWith this public art installation, we were able to use Lincoln\u2019s rich design heritage and technology, and bring a really fun and immersive experience to the seaport,\u201d says Jeremy Elias, executive creative director of Atlantic Re:think. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the typical approach to auto advertising, or a new-car launch, and the result is a piece of art that gives visitors at the seaport a real, valuable experience.\u201d\n\nCreated by design studio SOFTLab, The Nautilus consists of nearly 100 interactive poles, arranged in a circular constellation, that each respond to a visitor\u2019s touch and to environmental sounds. The entire installation is connected by a back-end computer and sensors, so that touching one pole sets off a choreographed audio and light display. While a single touch produces one tone, simultaneous interactions with the installation stimulate a complex, layered chorus. Its animated lights act as a dispersed lighthouse, which visitors to Brooklyn\u2019s waterfront park will be able to see from across the East River at night. The Nautilus will be open through September 10, and then move permanently to Lincoln\u2019s home, in Michigan.", "description": "Opening today, The Nautilus invites the public to please, touch this art", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/TheNautilus/facebook.jpg?1560794951"}
