REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration\n\nHis service, LeakZero, helps people surf the web anonymously, protect passwords and send encrypted messages. By design, he can\u2019t find out the names of the app\u2019s users or even know how many there are. It doesn\u2019t have a so-called \u2018back door.\u2019\n\nAnd as far as he knows, it\u2019s the only one of its kind on China.\n\nYang and the users of his service are fighting uphill and unusual battle for privacy in a place where the government is deeply involved in Big Data, and companies have done little to resist.\n\nTech industry executives have described the country\u2019s citizens as less sensitive about privacy than their Western counterparts, with Chinese search engine giant chief Robin Li saying last year that many in China were willing to trade it for convenience, safety or efficiency.\n\nBut that mindset has sparked debate about the consequences of access, with growing concern over the illegal collection of data and the rise of a black market for personal information.\n\nThe Chinese government has strengthened data protection laws, but foreign encrypted messaging apps like KakaoTalk and Line are banned in China while others, like Whatsapp or Signal, are occasionally blocked.\n\nThe most widely used homegrown services, Internet giant Tencent\u2019s messaging app WeChat and search engine Baidu are heavily monitored and censored by Chinese authorities.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nYang and users of LeakZero, which works with other companies\u2019 messaging apps and email platforms, say they are trying to find another way.\n\nHu Zhicheng, 23, who uses the company\u2019s search engine, password manager and encrypted messaging service, said proliferation of targeted advertising showed how much of his personal data had been collected.\n\n\u201cThese few years, I\u2019ve slowly realized personal privacy is very important,\u201d Hu said. \u201cIn China, you would receive a lot of spam calls and a lot of texts, all of them ads.\u201d\n\nNONSENSE MESSAGES\n\nYang, who used to be head of security for Amazon China and lived in the U.S. for 15 years, said he started researching privacy protection tools in China in 2017 but came up empty.\n\nHe started the company that would eventually launch LeakZero in March 2018, basing it on his belief that personal information should only be seen by the original user or an intended recipient.\n\nHis hope, he said, was that he would quickly find others in China who felt the same way.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have the power to change people\u2019s thoughts,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThe only thing I can do is to meet people\u2019s needs, and if the solution and timing is right, then this will take off.\u201d\n\nUsers launch LeakZero\u2019s encrypted messaging service and use a random name generator to create an ID. Then, when they open a messaging app like WeChat, LeakZero is \u201clayered\u201d on top.\n\nWhen they type a message, they can use LeakZero to turn their message into a nonsense string of letters and numbers in WeChat. The recipient must use LeakZero\u2019s app to decrypt the message.\n\nYang says users are superfans who spread the message and even help new joiners troubleshoot. So far, his encrypted messaging app has more than 34,000 aliases - although by design, he does not know how many users are behind them.\n\nThe company got $2 million in seed money to start up, and is free for now. The plan is to create something of value and later figure out a way to charge for it, he said.\n\nHis apps are available on the global app stores for Android and iOS, and he said that there was a universal need for such software, but that his main target for now is the Chinese audience.\n\nAnother user, who declined to give his name because of the sensitivity of the issue, told Reuters he started using the app last summer, eager to find an extra layer of protection. He has five telephone numbers to avoid spam calls, common on Chinese networks.\n\n\u201cI think I come from a position of fear, or horror really,\u201d he said. \u201cYou, as a person, your whole course of movement can be tracked. From when you step out of the door, there\u2019s a surveillance camera in the elevator.\u201d\n\nDIFFERENCES IN CHINA\n\nAlthough some Western tech giants such as Facebook, Apple, Alphabet and Amazon are blocked or restricted in China, and have opposed laws proposed by governments like Australia that would require them to provide access to private encrypted data linked to suspected illegal activities, Yang says he is happy to cooperate with the Chinese government.\n\nHe has not heard about his app from authorities or WeChat\u2019s parent company, Tencent, he said. The messaging apps his service operates on can see which users use LeakZero, though users can set up multiple aliases.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve done anything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd second, I didn\u2019t do this for any political motives. I just think in the course of my normal life and work I have this need.\u201d\n\nThere would also not be much for authorities to find, he believes, given how little user information he keeps.\n\n\u201cIf you give me even a little bit of info, at some point I\u2019m obligated to tell somebody. But if I don\u2019t know then I don\u2019t have this ability,\u201d Yang said.\n\nWeChat messages encrypted by Chinese app LeakZero are seen on a mobile phone in this illustration picture taken August 23, 2019. REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration\n\nStill, he said, he thought there would be far more demand for such privacy, expecting his app\u2019s search engine to process millions of searches per day. In reality, it has only registered up to 140,000 searches a day since its launch.\n\nFor the future, he is looking to develop products for corporate clients.\n\n\u201cBefore I thought this was a universal demand,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now looking at it, the people who are aware of this problem and would take some action and to protect themselves and their data, it\u2019s a pretty small group.\u201d", "description": "In a country where privacy protections are considered weak and anything-goes data collection has become the norm, Chinese tech entrepreneur Yang Geng stands out.", "authors": ["Huizhong Wu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426829290&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850K1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
