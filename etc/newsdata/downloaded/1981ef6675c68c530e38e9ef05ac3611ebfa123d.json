That would put Fernandez over the threshold to avoid a runoff as voters were rejecting Macri\u2019s tough-love austerity amid an economic crisis.\n\nRaucous crowds cheered at Fernandez\u2019s election headquarters, while the mood was far more muted across the city at Macri\u2019s election party.\n\n\u201cThis resounding victory in the first round is a very clear expression of the Argentine people,\u201d said Felipe Sol\u00e1, one of Fernandez\u2019s closest advisers.\n\nFernandez needs 45% of the vote or 40% with a 10-point lead over the runner-up to avoid a second round, which if needed would be held on Nov. 24.\n\nHe was the heavy favourite in the run-up to the vote, since winning a landslide victory in primaries in August. He extended that lead in pre-election opinion polls.\n\nArgentina\u2019s choice could have far-reaching implications. It is one of the world\u2019s top grain exporters, is stirring the energy world with its huge Vaca Muerta shale field and is on the cusp of restructuring talks with creditors over $100 billion in debt.\n\n\u2018TWO OPPOSING VIEWS OF COUNTRY\u2019\n\nPolling stations closed at 6 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Sunday. Soon afterward, local media started to call the election in Fernandez\u2019s favor, although with few details about the size of his lead.\n\n\u201cI voted for Fernandez because I see people just very unhappy in the street and I want a country with a better economy and more social support,\u201d Carlos Berenguer, 71, said outside a polling station in the district of Palermo in Buenos Aires.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in play in this election are simply two opposing views of the country,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Salom\u00f3n, mayor of farming town Saladillo, who was supporting Macri.\n\nFernandez, a relative unknown until this year outside Argentine political circles, had held a 20-point lead in most opinion polls after thumping Macri in the August primary. Markets had been rattled after the primary as investors feared a populist political shift.\n\nThe primary result - and the market crash that followed - sharply altered the dynamic of the race, pushing the country further into economic crisis and making Macri the underdog in an election that most had thought would be a closely fought battle.\n\n\u201cWe are in an enormous crisis and as a result, we all have to be very responsible for what\u2019s coming. It will be an effort from all of us,\u201d Fernandez said earlier in the day as he cast his vote in a Buenos Aires polling station.\n\nSupporters of presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez react, in Buenos Aires, Argentina October 27, 2019.

NO ARCHIVES\n\n\u2018FOUR COMPLEX YEARS\u2019\n\nThe economy has taken center stage with the country in the grip of recession for most of the past year, the outlook for growth darkening, annual inflation over 50%, job numbers down and poverty up sharply.\n\nOthers said, however, they feared a return of the Peronist left, which they blamed for leaving an already broken economy when Macri came to power in 2015. Supporters of the president said Macri needed more time to sort things out.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s been four complex years, I have hope Macri can fix it,\u201d said Pablo Nicol\u00e1s, 36, an accountant, as he voted on Sunday. He added he did not trust Fernandez\u2019s running mate, former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.\n\nMacri won backers with plans to reform Argentina\u2019s notoriously closed economy with trade deals and a successful push to lure foreign investment into energy projects and infrastructure.\n\nHis reform plans were badly hit in 2018 when a currency and debt crisis forced him to strike a deal with the International Monetary Fund for an eventual $57 billion to help the country to pay its bills.\n\nMacri, casting his vote to cheers of \u201cYes we can,\u201d said he understood the country was going through \u201canxious\u201d times, but hoped a strong turnout would help his cause.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of interest and we understand that this is a historic election for our country,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nFern\u00e1ndez looked poised, however, to take over Macri\u2019s mantle - as well as negotiations with creditors, including the IMF, about restructuring over $100 billion in sovereign debt amid fears the country could face a damaging default.\n\nMost investors are already pricing in a Peronist opposition win, although a big victory could lead to renewed volatility in markets, which have been constrained by recently imposed capital controls.", "description": "Argentina's Alberto Fernandez was leading the presidential election on Sunday and was on track to win outright, according to a count of 73% of the ballots, a result that would shift Latin America's No. 3 economy firmly back towards the Peronist left.", "authors": ["Nicol\u00e1s Misculin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445646665&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0V8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
