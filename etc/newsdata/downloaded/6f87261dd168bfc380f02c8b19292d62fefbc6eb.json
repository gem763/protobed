There's a number of those players within the side who've contributed to a fair bit of history for us,\" he said, in reference to a first-ever win over New Zealand (in 2016), the tour to Australia last year, and a triumph over South Africa in Cape Town two years ago.\n\n\"The accumulation of those experiences together hopefully builds a bit of confidence because you need to have some belief.\n\n\"You can't go out against an All Black side and accept you're second fiddle, you've got to put your best foot forward.\"\n\nIreland (15-1)\n\nRob Kearney; Keith Earls, Garry Ringrose, Robbie Henshaw, Jacob Stockdale; Johnny Sexton, Conor Murray; CJ Stander, Josh van der Flier, Peter O'Mahony; James Ryan, Iain Henderson; Tadhg Furlong, Rory Best (capt), Cian Healy\n\nReplacements: Niall Scannell, Dave Kilcoyne, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Beirne, Rhys Ruddock, Luke McGrath, Joey Carbery, Jordan Larmour\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Ireland's Robbie Henshaw will replace banned center Bundee Aki for their World Cup quarter-final against defending champions New Zealand on Saturday.
