And while the booming market in rentals is nothing new \u2013 these days, you can hire anything from a wedding dress to a pasta maker and a desk in a co-working space \u2013 the concept is fast expanding into the luxury sphere. Not only can you rent that handbag or evening gown; you can now rent the jewels to go with it.\n\nPiggybacking on the success of the pioneering fashion rental company Rent the Runway, companies including the US-based Flont, Haute Vault and Switch now offer one-off and subscription-based jewellery hire services. And it\u2019s not just costume jewellery up for grabs \u2013 semi-precious and fine jewellery from the likes of Cartier, Tiffany and Van Cleef & Arpels is available to rent.

Known for its selection of vintage jewellery, Switch offers items from Chanel, Herm\u00e8s, Yves Saint Laurent and Dior.\n\nIn June, The New York Times declared that \u201cowning nothing is now a luxury\u201d \u2013 renting is not merely about convenience and cost, it's about status.\n\nA gold-toned Coco Chanel vintage necklace, available from Switch.\n\nIn The State of Fashion 2019 report, written jointly by Business of Fashion and Mckinsey, the growth of rental is attributed to \u201cgrowing consumer desire for variety, sustainability and affordability\u201d. And, of course, consumers are not exclusively renting \u2013 more and more, renting is a prelude to purchasing, particularly when it comes to watch hire.\n\nYou'll look the part in this Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore Safari chronograph. Find it at Acquired Time.\n\nAcquired Time, a Singapore-based watch rental start-up, offers subscription services starting at $S175 ($188) a month for a minimum of six months (at which price point IWC Pilot\u2019s Chronographs and Omega Speedmasters are available). For the top tier of $S575 you can upgrade to a Rolex GMT Master II, worth about $28,000.\n\nThe service, says co-founder Roy Tong, is seen as a way to build on existing watch collections and effectively try before you buy.", "description": "As rental services become more popular and mainstream, it seems you can hire just about anything \u2013 including fine jewellery.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4608%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_10/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/108f6328821a8bec5c84d577f85d280cec4b8f8d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
