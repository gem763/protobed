The big difference is, Stephens plans on throwing bombs from the opening bell.\n\n\u201cIt brings a whole different fight,\u201d Stephens said in an interview with Karyn Bryant. \u201c(The first fight) was a five-rounder, and going into that fight, the mentality was a little bit different. But then coming straight here to a three-round fight, it\u2019s going to be a little more vicious. It\u2019s a different type of fight now, so it\u2019s going to be everything swinging \u2013 everything\u2019s going to be swinging to put the lights out.\u201d\n\nTheir first fight was stopped when an accidental eye poke by Rodriguez rendered Stephens unable to continue after just 15 seconds. A visibly frustrated Rodriguez accused Stephens of looking for a way out. That resulted in a hotel lobby altercation the next day in which the two had to be separated.\n\nThey won\u2019t have to wait long to run it back. They are rescheduled to a fight in Boston on Oct. 18, less than a month after their first bout. While Stephens had to put up with a lot of criticism from the fans, as well as Rodriguez accusing him of faking the eye injury, he intends on making him pay on fight night.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to make it that much sweeter when I put his lights out. It\u2019s a different fight. This is three rounds. I already have the cardio to go five. Now I get to go three. Everything I throw is going to be bad intentions on this kid, so I\u2019m really looking to put him in his place \u2013 and all eyes are on me to do it. So like I said, big banger in Boston. We\u2019re going to bring it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLil\u2019 Heathen\u201d traveled early to Mexico to get acclimated to the high altitude in preparation for a five-round war. But now that the fight will be 15 minutes, Stephens (28-16 MMA, 15-15 UFC) thinks with his hard-hitting style, the preparation he\u2019s already had in terms of cardio will pay dividends on fight night.\n\nHe plans on bringing the fight to \u201cEl Pantera,\u201d closing the distance and swinging. Some of Stephens\u2019 past losses were due to opponents outpointing him, going in and out and picking their shots. But he doesn\u2019t plan on letting Rodriguez (11-2 MMA, 7-1 UFC) do the same thing.\n\n\u201cI think my mindset going into the last one, I was really kind of wanting to whoop his (expletive) for 25 minutes and kind of put him at that make-him-want-to quit stage,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThis time, three rounds to do so, guys are always squeaking by, outpointing me with these decisions, these rounds, and I\u2019m chasing them. But I think everything that I\u2019m going to throw is going to be bad intentions in order to put his lights out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing in the closer \u2013 like, you\u2019re bringing in the right hander. Everything is going to be a bad intent. It\u2019s going to be vicious, and I\u2019ve got the cardio to back it up \u2013 so sweet dreams to this kid.\u201d", "description": "Jeremy Stephens vows to make Yair Rodriguez pay for his words at UFC on ESPN 6 in Boston, says three-round fight plays to his favor.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "The Blue Corner", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Ken Hathaway", "Mmajunkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/jeremy-stephens-ufc-fight-night-1241.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
