(AP) - On a night the Buffalo Sabres\u2018 top scorers were held in check, Kyle Okposo and his line of grinders came to the rescue.\n\nOkposo set up both goals in regulation before Jack Eichel and Casey Mittelstadt scored in the shootout to help Buffalo match its best start to a season in 10 years with a 3-2 win over the Florida Panthers on Friday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a bench cheer so much for another line having success,\u201d coach Ralph Krueger said of how his so-called energy line scored goals 2:33 apart spanning the second intermission to stake Buffalo to a 2-0 lead. \u201cTo see all that hard work, the grinding they\u2019ve been doing the first five games paying off was so big tonight.\u201d\n\nIt might have been even more satisfying had the Sabres not squandered a two-goal, third-period lead for a second consecutive game. Buffalo blew a 4-2 lead in an eventual 5-4 overtime win over Montreal on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe just sat back a little bit,\u201d said Okposo, who had the primary assists on goals scored by Johan Larsson and defenseman Marco Scandella. \u201cWe just have to find a way to continue to play our game and continue to stay aggressive.\u201d\n\nZemgus Girgensons also had two assists on a night Buffalo\u2019s potent power play finished 0 for 4. Linus Ullmark finished with 41 saves, with two more in the shootout.\n\nBuffalo improved to 4-0-1 and opened with three straight home wins for the first time since 2008-09.\n\nMike Hoffman forced overtime by scoring with 11 seconds left. Left open in the right circle, he waited patiently before snapping a shot over Ullmark\u2019s left shoulder. Evgenii Dadonov had a goal and assist, and Jonathan Huberdeau had two assists for Florida (1-2-1).\n\nMuch of the credit goes to goalie Sergei Bobrovsky, who made 30 saves, including several in the final 1:45 of overtime.\n\nFirst he lunged up to get a piece of Eichel\u2019s shot on a breakaway. Then, Bobrovsky kicked out his left pad to stop Mittelstadt, who was set up at the right post.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge point for us,\u201d Bobrovsky said. \u201cObviously, we could clean up some things, but I thought the boys stepped up and showed character.\u201d\n\nBobrovsky was coming off a 6-3 loss to Carolina on Tuesday, when he was yanked after allowing four goals on 14 shots through the first period.\n\nEichel scored on Buffalo\u2019s first shootout attempt by banking in a shot off the right post. After Florida\u2019s Vincent Trocheck and Aleksander Barkov failed on their attempts, Mittelstadt sealed the victory by backhanding a shot inside the crossbar.\n\nUllmark was impressed by how the Sabres didn\u2019t let up after surrendering the lead.\n\n\u201cWe never hesitated. We stayed calm on the bench. No one got upset or anything like that,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd he blamed himself for allowing Hoffman\u2019s goal, which came with Bobrovsky pulled for an extra attacker.\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve had that. He\u2019s known to go top glove,\u201d said Ullmark, who stopped 40 shots in a 4-3 overtime loss at Columbus on Monday night. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to stop the puck.\u201d\n\nLarsson opened the scoring with 31 seconds left in the second period just as Hoffman finished serving a cross-checking penalty.\n\nOkposo drove up the right wing and drew two defenders while entering the Panthers\u2018 zone. Okposo then slipped a pass to an open Larsson, who roofed a shot in and then went soaring over Bobrovsky, who was a split-second late in getting across with 31 seconds left in the second period.\n\nBuffalo\u2019s power-play unit entered the game having converted eight of 15 opportunities.\n\nScandella put Buffalo up 2-0 by jumping into the play and converting Okposo\u2019s pass into the left circle by scoring 2:02 into the third period.\n\nThe Sabres had several point streaks come to an end, including defenseman Rasmus Dahlin\u2019s four-gamer, in which he had a goal and six assists, and rookie forward Victor Olofsson, who combined for four goals and an assist in his first four games.\n\nNOTES: Buffalo entered the day with 18 goals scored in first four games, the most over that same span since scoring 19 in 2007-08. \u2026 Panthers remain the NHL\u2019s only team to not have scored a goal in the first period this season. \u2026 Panthers C Denis Malgin returned to the lineup after sitting out two games and replaced Henrik Borgstrom.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPanthers: At New York Islanders on Saturday.\n\nSabres: Close three-game homestand against Dallas Stars on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "On a night the Buffalo Sabres' top scorers were held in check, Kyle Okposo and his line of grinders came to the rescue.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/panthers_sabres_hockey_02784_c0-167-4048-2528_s1200x700.jpg?5d77a4e25ce612090d371c949c711cdf1f8cf485", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
