That\u2019s how long it will take to close the gender gap unless we speed up the process, says a recent report by the World Economic Forum.\n\nAnd looking at the statistics, this makes sense. A recent study by Pew Research found that the gender pay gap has narrowed but stayed relatively stable since\u2026 the 80s.\n\nSomehow, we\u2019ve learned how to build self-driving cars and smartphones with more computing power than the first computers used in space travel, but we still haven\u2019t figured out how to pay men and women equally.\n\nLuckily, social and government-led pressure is mounting. Movements like the Women\u2019s March and #metoo are bringing discrimination into the spotlight, while many countries including Denmark, the UK, France, and Germany are now requiring companies to report on their gender pay gap every year.\n\nIt\u2019s not just society and governments. With so much evidence of the bottom line benefits, diversity can bring to a company, more and more are looking to close their pay gap in order to attract more diverse talent.\n\nWith so much will and incentive to finally close the gap, why are we still not making gains? The emergence of new technologies may be able to give us the answer.\n\nWhy we\u2019re not making progress\n\nIn a strange turn of events, Google recently reported it found a pay discrepancy which would actually have resulted in male engineers being paid less in 2019. Rather than it being a difference in salary, the discrepancy resulted in a larger percentage of discretionary funds being allocated to female engineers. As a result, they corrected this mistake ahead of time by increasing the expected wages of thousands of male Googlers.\n\nComing from a company which is now facing a potential class-action lawsuit from current and former female engineers and an investigation by the US Department of Labor for discrimination in pay and promotion, the new report is certainly raising eyebrows (and eye-rolls in some cases).\n\nGoogle\u2019s data only compares employees within the same pay grade. According to the New York Times, one of the plaintiffs bringing a lawsuit against the company claimed she was hired in at a lower level than male engineers with the same experience. Critics argue it\u2019s likely the discrepancy actually comes from more experienced women being hired in at lower levels and then allocated more discretionary pay to compensate for the clear mistake in leveling.\n\nIt\u2019s examples like these which clearly show the cracks in our data when it comes to solving the gender pay gap.\n\nOne of the biggest problems companies face is seeing the symptoms of the gap but not actually having the insights to identify the causes within their unique structural makeup. At the moment, most companies have their payroll and HR data on two separate systems meaning that discrepancies resulting from issues in their hiring or promotion structures aren\u2019t accounted for.\n\nBecause of this lack of insights, we\u2019re seeing a lot of companies spend massive amounts of time and resources on strategies that simply aren\u2019t working. But AI and machine learning may be able to provide a more microscopic view of what\u2019s actually happening.\n\nCan AI and machine learning help close the gap?\n\nZara Nanu, CEO of Gapsquare, a software service that\u2019s helping companies address the gender pay gap through its AI and machine learning technology, explained her view.\n\nOftentimes, companies will go through an almost manic push to solve their gender pay gap problems quickly. For example, some will try offering high starting salaries to attract more female applicants in the short run but, ultimately, if inequalities still exist in your leveling and later promotion and pay structures, this won\u2019t result in a long term solution.\n\n\u201cInstead, we need to help companies understand how those discrepancies can be covered in a more sustainable way that doesn\u2019t disadvantage either gender. It\u2019s not about stealing a slice of the pie; it\u2019s about building the pie together equally,\u201d she explained.\n\nGapsquare\u2019s technology allows companies to run their payroll and HR data through one system. Using AI and machine learning technology, they\u2019re able to merge and analyze the data together providing expertise in three key areas:\n\nIdentifying any existing pay discrepancies based on gender but also ethnicity, disability or any other employee characteristics\n\nInsights into why these gaps exist based on a combination of data and academic expertise from the backend\n\nOpportunities to take more data-driven decisions to narrow these gaps\n\nAs Nanu explained, a company\u2019s data is often based on \u201ccomplex reward and compensation structures with over a thousand different elements of pay.\u201d With Gapsquare\u2019s software, companies can look at both outright salary based inequalities but also, for example, discrepancies which could arise from less visible factors like housing and car allowances.\n\nWith this information, companies can zero in on which departments or at which levels glass ceilings exist and use data-driven decisions to create real sustainable change.\n\n\u201cGender equality can be a very emotional and political topic within a company. You get people engaging in debates about whether they should introduce quotas or targets or other methods with very little action actually happening in the end. Whereas, with the software, we have the numbers and a graph and an explanation of why the numbers are what they are. This makes it a lot easier for managers to start taking data-driven decisions and moving things along,\u201d she remarked.\n\nThe irony of using AI to tackle bias\n\nIronically, the AI field itself has one of the biggest gender gaps. Currently, only 22% of the AI workforce is made up of women. According to Nanu, \u201cthe gender pay gap is three times higher in AI. This is a major problem as this technology is actually shaping our future.\u201d\n\nAt just 17, Sara Conejo Cervantes has become a spokeswoman for AI and gender, having spoken at the UN AI for Good Summit and the AI Europe Stakeholder Summit this past year. She explained that the looming gender pay gap is already top of mind for her and other girls looking to get into the field.\n\n\u201cIf I go into the field and I have a colleague who is being paid more just because of their gender, I would feel like I\u2019m losing out on something. It creates a path where women feel they have to prove themselves to be able to take on that role.\u201d\n\nThe massive gender gap in the field is already showing its effect on the AI-powered tech we\u2019re using today. For example, voice recognition bots like Siri, Alexa, Google Home, and Cortana all feature female voices as their primary setting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a study that shows if you speak to Alexa or Siri in a passive-aggressive or even abusive way they usually brush off what you say or respond with a flirtatious remark.\u201d\n\nJust like in other applications of AI, we\u2019re starting to see this issue more and more as it enters the field of HR Tech. Amazon attempted to use AI to create a fast moving recruitment tool, only to find it learned to penalize female applicants by allocating lower scores to resumes with the word \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d as in \u201cwomen\u2019s chess club captain\u201d or those who attended women\u2019s only colleges.\n\nThe problem is that AI and machine learning technology uses historical data to learn and make decisions. Ultimately, if your past data is biased, the outcomes will be too. As Conejo explained,\n\n\u201cRight now is when we\u2019re starting to spot these patterns in algorithms, in particular in AI, and if we don\u2019t start fixing them now, it\u2019s going to be very hard in the future as they\u2019ll already be deeply embedded into these algorithms.\u201d\n\nGapsquare\u2019s team also faced this challenge. The interesting thing they\u2019ve found is that, after you take away the parts of a gap which can be explained by performance, length of service, and educational level, you\u2019ll then still have about 60 percent unexplained which can be directly attributed to bias and societal norms impacting women\u2019s career progression.\n\nTheir team is now working with experts from Harvard and the University of Exeter to introduce different parameters which take bias into account, essentially filtering out past discrimination. This will take time but:\n\n\u201cThe way we see our work is that, yes, we\u2019re now using AI to see how we can specifically unpick bias in recruitment and career progression but, at the same time, we want to make sure that what we develop is then applicable to other spheres where we will start to be more aware and conscious about bias and the need to control for it,\u201d Nanu shared.\n\nUsing data to finally close the pay gap\n\nIf the WEF\u2019s prediction is true, it means that young promising engineers like Conejo still won\u2019t see the gender pay gap close within their lifetime. As Conejo explained,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really in our control and that\u2019s why, when I speak at conferences and other events, I really try to bring this up. If someone is doing the same job, they should be paid equally. But I tend to see that the people who are there don\u2019t really have much interest in what I\u2019m saying, both because I\u2019m very young and also a female.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, with more women leveraging AI and machine learning to filter bias out of our data, we\u2019ll have the insights we need to finally start narrowing the gap.\n\n\u201cIf I walk into a board room and see there\u2019s one woman standing in a crowd of 20 men it\u2019s obvious there isn\u2019t diversity and we need to encourage it. I think having the data can really reinforce that,\u201d Conejo concluded.\n\nBy combining a passion for people with the power of today\u2019s intelligent machines, Randstad supports people and organizations in realizing their true potential.
