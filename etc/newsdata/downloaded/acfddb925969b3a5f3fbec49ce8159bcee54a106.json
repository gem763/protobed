Another thanked South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham \u2014 who on Tuesday vowed to implement \u201csanctions from hell\u201d on Turkey if war breaks out \u2014 for taking a stance against the withdrawal.\n\nThe rally was led by the American Rojava Center for Democracy (ARCDEM), which advocates for a democratic Syria.\n\n\u201cThe United States and the international community must reverse this decision, refuse to allow any Turkish invasion, and instead pursue a negotiated settlement that reflects the interests of all the peoples of Syria,\u201d the group said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe group joined lawmakers and U.S. officials who have insisted that allowing Turkey into the region would spur a resurgence of the Islamic State terror group.\n\n\u201cA Turkish invasion would also allow ISIS to regroup and regain strength,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThey cannot be trusted to secure captured terrorists or continue the fight against sleeper cells that continue to destabilize the region.\u201d\n\nTurkey on Monday began preparing for a military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in Northeast Syria that is expected to take place over the next several days.\n\nAlthough administration officials have insisted that as few as 50 U.S. forces would be repositioned, about 1,000 U.S. troops remained deployed in northern Syria. It\u2019s unclear whether the remaining forces would stay in Syria if widespread violence erupts, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s ultimate goal has long been to bring all U.S. troops home.\n\nDespite their small number, the U.S. troops in Syria were seen as a restraint on Turkish military action across the border.\n\nOne rallygoer, who requested only to be identified as \u201cOmer,\u201d said Tuesday that the U.S. pullback came as a surprise to the local Kurdish community.\n\n\u201cMost of the Kurdish community here in D.C. was so shocked with that decision,\u201d he told The Washington Times.\n\nOmer, a Kurdish-American man living in the District, explained that because the U.S. has invested significantly in clearing the area of Islamic State over the last several years and has since played a peacekeeping role in northern Syria, the move was not welcomed among the Kurdish community.\n\n\u201cAt least there should be a road map,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe U.S. presence is symbolic over there and very meaningful. If there\u2019s not any USA military over there, it\u2019s kind of open door for a Turkish invasion.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
