One YouTuber recently stumbled across some apparently never-before-seen footage from the making of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, and it\u2019s a discovery as exciting as Harrison Ford\u2019s Indy first laying his hands on that shiny golden idol.\n\nThe 44-minute video, first spotted by ScreenCrush, shows the behind-the-scenes of Indy\u2019s memorable escape from the Peruvian temple on his buddy Jock\u2019s biplane. YouTuber Joe Hughes, who found the footage in his grandfather\u2019s VHS collection, describes in the video description that his grandfather\u2019s neighbor was a pilot who rented a plane to the film\u2019s crew in Hawaii. Even better, said neighbor and his family got to hang out with the crew during production and capture a bunch of cool BTS footage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the video has no audio\u2014Hughes says he plans to upload a commentary track from his grandpa with more details\u2014it\u2019s still a pretty awesome find, full of shots of Ford balancing on the plane\u2019s floats, a young George Lucas chatting with the crew, and a bunch of kids having the summer vacay of their life riding on the top of boats.\n\nCheck out the original \u201cJock!
