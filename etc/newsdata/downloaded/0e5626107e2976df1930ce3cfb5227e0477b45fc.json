So that\u2019s the kind of memoir that I chose to write, just naturally.\u201d\n\nFor more than a quarter-century since her landmark first album \u201cExile in Guyville\u201d made her a feminist favorite, Phair has swerved between cult status and larger stardom, between deep-dive indie albums and pop near-hits, making choices that thrilled some fans and confounded others.\n\nBut \u201cHorror Stories,\u201d which stretches from childhood to her 50s, gives virtually none of the play-by-play behind all that, dwelling instead on moments that may seem insignificant but have proved difficult to forget, as big as giving birth to those as small as moving on with her night instead of helping a drunken girl in a public bathroom who looked like she needed it.\n\n\u201cI had to kind of really go into the recollections that had stuck with me that were really unresolved in a way, kind of still haunting me,\u201d Phair told The Associated Press.\n\nLike memory itself, the essays in \u201cHorror Stories\u201d jump in time and shift from haziness into clarity, often leaving out the year or other grounding details.\n\n\u201cTo me, the interesting parts about life are the things you can\u2019t look up,\u201d Phair said. \u201cI want to know how you felt. I want to know what you were going through. That\u2019s the part that I can\u2019t get by Googling.\u201d\n\nShe said that while the writing process was so lonely compared to music that at times she \u201cwent cuckoo,\u201d she also took comfort in how much putting her thoughts to paper resembled putting her thoughts to music.\n\n\u201cI treated these as if they were songs,\u201d she said. \u201cI made a collection of short stories as if it were a long-form album.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s far from finished making actual albums too. A new record that she quietly made with the team behind \u201cExile in Guyville\u201d was announced Tuesday. The first single, \u201cGood Side ,\u201d will be released Friday.\n\nPhair said her publishers were hands-off in allowing her to take her novel approach to the book, but urged her to talk about the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe resulting essay, by far the timeliest chapter in the book, opens with her reluctance to address the subject, describing her reaction to reading women\u2019s stories of Ryan Adams\u2019 sexual misconduct, which he has denied.\n\nPhair, who does not use Adams\u2019 name in the book but has acknowledged in interviews she\u2019s talking about him, worked on an aborted album with the rocker. She writes that he \u201chit on\u201d her, but did not treat her as poorly as other women say he did, nor behave as badly as many other men have toward her.\n\nIn the essay, Phair\u2019s hesitance gives way to a flood of memories of sexual mistreatment of the times men had stalked her through airports or forced themselves on her in business meetings.\n\n\u201cIt was an overwhelming experience to go back and try to list all the traumatic things that had happened to me whether it\u2019s sexual harassment in the workplace, or just predatory men when I was younger,\u201d Phair said. \u201cThere are things that either I had not told anyone about or had tried to compartmentalize and put on a shelf. But once I started to open up all the boxes of memories, I really just wanted to throw them all out of the closet on the floor and just be like, \u2018and this one, and this one, and this one, and this one.\u2019 It\u2019s not unrealistic to most women\u2019s experience. We have dozens and dozens and dozens of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are full,\u201d she writes in the book. \u201cWe can\u2019t hold any more.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton .\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When she began writing her new memoir, Liz Phair found she wanted to tell inside-the-mind stories, not behind-the-scenes stories.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dalton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/liz_phair_portrait_session_71389_c0-222-5319-3323_s1770x1032.jpg?46ab3229e1b32f6c021d145d6aaaa55c9ab61ad2", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
