fires.\n\n\u201cAll hands are focusing on the Kincade, the most stubborn challenge we face.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference on Sunday, officials said they expect the current conditions of high winds and low humidity \u2013 that can lead to the rapid spread of fire \u2013 to persist for days.\n\nCounty of Sonoma Supervisor David Rabbitt said: \u201cWe know we are not out of the woods, and the wind conditions that were ferocious continue today.\u201d\n\nThere are currently no reports of deaths or major injuries.\n\nCalifornia Fire officials said on Sunday that the fire had grown to burn over 85 square miles, and officials reported containment had dropped to 5 per cent with at least 94 structures now destroyed.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, two grass fires briefly halted traffic on an Interstate bridge and the flames came dangerously close to homes in Vallejo.\n\nAnother grass fire closed a stretch of interstate that cuts through the state capital as smoke obstructed drivers.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address

As of Sunday night, the Tick Fire was 70 per cent contained.\n\nThe biggest evacuation was in Northern California\u2019s Sonoma County where 180,000 people were told to pack up and leave, many in the middle of the night.\n\nTo prevent its power lines from sparking in the high winds and setting off more blazes, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) said on Sunday that preventative shut-offs impacted 965,000 customers and another 100,000 lost electricity because of strong gusts, bringing the number of residents impacted by blackouts to nearly 2.7 million people.\n\nPG&E officials said they were expecting strong winds to whip up again on Tuesday and that they have notified 500,000 customers \u2013 or more than 1 million people \u2013 that they are likely to have their power turned off for the third time in a week.\n\nChief executive officer and president of PG&E Andrew M Vesey said: \u201cWe recognise the hardship of not having power.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard with all our partners to ensure the most vulnerable customers are being cared for.\u201d\n\nSome of those people might not have their power restored from the current outage before the next major shutdown, which would leave them without electricity for five days or longer, said Mark Quinlan, PG&E\u2019s emergency preparedness and response director.\n\nThe fear that the winds could blow embers and spread fire across a major highway prompted authorities to expand evacuation orders that covered parts of Santa Rosa, a city of 175,000 that was devastated by a wildfire two years ago.\n\nSonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office tweeted on Sunday: \u201cThis is the largest evacuation that any of us can remember. Take care of each other.\u201d\n\nHundreds of people arrived at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa by Sunday.\n\nSome came from senior care facilities. More than 300 people slept inside an auditorium filled with cots and wheeled beds. Scores of others stayed in a separate building with their pets.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "California\u2018s governor has declared a state-wide emergency, ordering nearly 200,000 people\u00a0to flee from the threat of\u00a0wildfires\u00a0fuelled by ferocious winds.
