For many, it was a relatable story of parenting and the fears and absurdities that come along the way.\n\nAD\n\nBut, as is often the case in viral stories, others took the opportunity to criticize Cibuls. Among the laughing emoji, she was disheartened to see a few comments bashing her parenting abilities.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was so embarrassed,\u201d a laughing Cibuls told The Washington Post. \u201cI mean, I was relieved, but I was so embarrassed that I was debating whether I should even update all the ladies from my mom group.\u201d\n\nSo last night I was positive there was a ghost baby in the bed with my son. I was so freaked out, I barely slept. I even...

Stories abound of strange splotches or creaking doors showing up on the tiny screens and terrifying moms and dads, according to a Wall Street Journal story on the phenomenon. Much of it can be explained away as the cameras picking up on \u201cpoints of movement, such as lights, shadows or blowing curtains,\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\nAD\n\nAfter confirming that her baby was alone in his crib, Cibuls racked her mind for an explanation. Her husband, who was still at work, chimed in \u2014 as did her mom and best friend. Could it be a patch of drool? Another baby monitor feed somehow getting looped in?\n\nAD\n\nShe kept the monitor in front of her face all night. Despite herself, she kept opening her eyes over and over again to make sure the \u201cghost baby\u201d wasn\u2019t moving.\n\n\u201cThe more I looked at it, the more I was thinking I was tricking myself into believing that it\u2019s something,\u201d Cibuls said. \u201cSo I posted it in one of my mom groups, and I said something like, \u2018Hey, do you guys see the baby? It\u2019s really creeping me out,\u2019 because I wanted to know if I was going crazy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThey all \u201cgot a good laugh\u201d the next morning when she figured out the explanation. Normally, the photo of the baby on the mattress label isn\u2019t visible. It appeared on the baby monitor Friday night because of some combination of the camera\u2019s night vision and Cibuls\u2019s husband forgetting to put on the mattress cover after changing the sheets. (\u201cI could kill him!\u201d she joked on Facebook.)\n\nAD\n\nJust for the record, Cibuls said: \u201cIf I really thought our child was in danger, I wouldn\u2019t have left him in there.\u201d\n\nEven after the cause was revealed, the image of the ghostly baby is creepy enough that it nearly spooked the family a second time.\n\n\u201cI was watching the monitor again last night, and I was like, oh my gosh, what is that?\u201d Cibuls said. \u201cBut this time, obviously, I knew what it was.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Maritza Cibuls had a hard time sleeping after seeing what looked like a ghost on her baby monitor.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0oWZk-UucsitKgLfSikgqlsUN9I=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-20-2019/t_efe70ccef35348af9b1b195e2bd34b9c_name_ghost.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
