She broke with royal tradition that tended to dictate a visiting royal would do little more than receive bouquets from the kids and smile while retaining a regal, dignified posture and facial expression.\n\nThe memory created in the people they met was more one of having seen a very special, high-status person.\n\nDiana\u2019s techniques of self-lowering, such as diminishing her own status, signals to make people feel at ease allowed both Kate and Meghan to reach out to children at their own level instead.\n\nMirroring techniques\n\nBoth Kate and Meghan employ some very clever mirroring techniques with the children they meet to allow for a more natural and less over-awed response.\n\nMeghan\u2019s tour even involved some mirroring with her clothing, opting for denims and casual wear rather than a more formal, regal look.\n\nOnce she learns the steps of the dancing the girls are doing in these clips she mimics their steps with a lack of inhibition to allow them all to be enjoying the same experience at the same time.\n\nKate dips down to the same level as the smaller children she is meeting and we can see her mimicking their \u2018baby wave\u2019 rituals, with a low, childlike wave ritual as she approaches and leaves them.\n\nStatus-swapping\n\nKate and Meghan both lower their own status and power signals to raise the confidence levels of the children they meet. Meghan approaches the dancers with a head-tilt and slightly shy smile, carefully watching and eye-checking the dancers before picking up their steps.\n\nShe allows them to teach her and in both these clips she is taking her learning seriously, putting the power in the hands of the children.\n\nKate is seen playing with some children at a table and again she is watching them and appearing to learn from then rather than the other way round.\n\nWhen she approaches the group of children that are standing to meet her she immediately uses self-diminishing techniques to lower her own status with them, pulling her arms into her body and lowering to their height. All this body language self-lowering would have the effect of boosting the young childrens\u2019 confidence.\n\nRoyal Charisma\n\nThere is a truism about genuine charisma that suggests people might forget what you said or did but they will never forget how you made them feel.\n\nMeghan and Kate both use the style of charisma that is aimed at making the people they meet, especially the children, feel good rather than in awe of and impressed by them as high-status royals.\n\nBoth use congruent facial expressions and body language like touch to suggest they really are happiest when they\u2019re communicating with children on their tours.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Body language expert Judi James tells how both royals have demonstrated an exceptional ability to calm children they meet during public engagements", "authors": ["Judi James"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642111.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196163339.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
