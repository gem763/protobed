Cain\u2019s vengeance left devastation in its wake, and his marriage to Moira is hanging by a thread \u2014 but is it irreparable?\n\nAfter everything that\u2019s transpired, it\u2019s safe to say that Cain\u2019s not in a good place. He\u2019s found out that the new farmhand has not only been sleeping with his wife, but that he also happens to be his son. Then, of course, there\u2019s the fact that his beloved Moira has been cheating on him \u2014 which came as a devastating blow considering all the hurdles they\u2019ve come through in the past.\n\nCain\u2019s in a low place in the coming episodes, but Moira\u2019s not willing to give up on her marriage without a fight, and thus she heads up to the farm. While there, she makes an effort to explain why she had an affair in the first place, but it\u2019s clear from the offset that Cain\u2019s not interested in what she has to say. In fact, he resorts to some pretty drastic action to forget about what\u2019s happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscussing Cain\u2019s response to Moira\u2019s affair, actor Jeff said: \u2018After the explanations from Moira that don\u2019t tell him what he wants to know, he starts to hit self-destruct and Kerry\u2019s in the pub and she\u2019s a bit drunk and she just sits down next to him. The scenes are funny and charged \u2014 it\u2019s nice to have a bit of light relief. It\u2019s been great working with Laura because I think the pair of them, Kerry and Cain \u2014 from what\u2019s happened to them in the stories recently \u2014 they\u2019re both really damaged and they don\u2019t really care about what\u2019s happening.\u2019\n\nA one-night-stand with Kerry may help Cain forget about all what\u2019s happened, but for Moira \u2014 who stumbles upon the pair together \u2014 it\u2019s no doubt going to feel like a betrayal. However, knowing that Moira\u2019s caught him with another woman doesn\u2019t seem to phase Cain.\n\nJeff said: \u2018I think he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s glad to see her hurt. It pleases him for her to know how he felt.\u2019\n\nYes, you know what they say: revenge is a dish best served cold \u2014 and Cain\u2019s actions here are most certainly cold, so much so that Moira believes there to be no going back afterwards. However, this is the Cain and Moira we\u2019re talking about here, and \u2014 given they\u2019ve been through so much as a couple and managed to come out the other end \u2014 is this really the end for them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff reckons so, as he said: \u2018The consequence of this storyline sadly means that Cain and Moira are no more. And who knows if they will ever get back together?\n\nThe interesting thing about Cain is that it was his marriage to Moira that kept his darker side in check. With the stability of married life and there support of his wife having now vanished from his life, could we perhaps see the return of a darker, more volatile Cain?\n\nJeff mused: \u2018Yes. Definitely. Of his many low points in his life I think this is as low as he\u2019s going to get. Not only has he lost his wife again, but he\u2019s lost his wife to a son that he didn\u2019t even know he had, so it\u2019s like a double punch in the gut.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cain struggles to forgive Moira after what transpired with Nate, which results in their marriage coming to an end.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/05_11_emm_cain_moira_02-0014_1571762536.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
