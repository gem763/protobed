He grabbed her wrist and asked: \"Do you want to come back to mine?\"\n\nAfter telling him 'No', Laverick asked if she wanted to have sex with him, which was met with the same response and she pushed him away.\n\nLaverick then pushed the girl up against a wall, pulled her trousers down and raped her.\n\nJust months later, Laverick approached another girl while she was walking along Chapel Hill, and grabbed her left arm from behind.\n\nShe told him to get off and leave her alone, but Laverick began sexually assaulting her before the passer-by intervened. She thought she was going to be raped.\n\nLaverick was 16 when he raped the first girl and 17 when he sexually assaulted and tried to rape the other.\n\nHis barrister, Dale Brook, said he had an emotionally unstable personality disorder.\n\nJudge David Tremberg remanded Laverick in custody and adjourned sentencing for the preparation of reports, including an assessment of whether he should be treated as dangerous.\n\nThe judge told Laverick: \"You have been convicted on clear evidence of these matters.\n\n\"I'm sure that I don't need me to tell you how serious they are.\n\n\"They are likely to result in a substantial custodial sentence, possibly within the framework of a sentence under the dangerous offender provisions, but that's a matter for the future.\"\n\nThe judge thanked the eight women and four men of the jury for the attention they had given to what he described as a \"troubling case\".\n\nIn a statement after the hearing, Detective Constable Sarah Gladstone, who conducted the investigation, said: \"The offences that Michael Laverick has been convicted of are very serious sexual offences.\n\n\u201cThe victims have been exceedingly brave in coming forward, telling us about their ordeals and standing up to such a dangerous man.\n\n\u201cThey remained brave and resolute throughout the investigation and attended court to give evidence last week.\n\n\u201cWe want to thank the victims for coming forward and placing their trust in the Humberside Police Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) Team to seek justice for the dreadful offences they endured.\n\n\u201cI hope this case will help any other victims of CSE or abuse to come forward and speak to the police about their experiences, no matter how much time has passed since the offences occurred.\n\n\u201cMichael Laverick\u2019s conviction sends a clear message to perpetrators that this type of behaviour and offence will be investigated thoroughly.\n\n\u201cAnyone found to have committed such awful crimes will be brought before the court as Michael Laverick has been and will face the full force of the justice system.\u201d", "description": "Michael Laverick, from Pocklington, attacked two girls after approaching them from behind while they were walking alone in secluded areas near his home", "authors": ["Simon Bristow", "Image", "Hull Daily Mail Ws", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703416.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Michael-Laverick.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
