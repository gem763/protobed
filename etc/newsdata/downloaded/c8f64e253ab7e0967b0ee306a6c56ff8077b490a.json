Though he had one of the shortest speaking times during Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate, Castro used his limited window to talk almost exclusively about police violence in his answers about gun regulation.\n\nCastro has been especially focused on issues of social justice and criminal justice reform both on the debate stage and campaign trail this year, and his campaign has highlighted the fact that he is one of the few candidates to pay such close attention to those issues.\n\n\"While other campaigns focused on attacking bold ideas and the frontrunners in the last debate, I was the only one to highlight police violence, the shooting of Atatiana Jefferson, and I was the only candidate to point out the hypocrisy of letting ISIS fighters run free in Syria while keeping innocent children in cages at our southern border,\" Castro wrote in the email.\n\nHis mention of the men and women who have been killed by police officers have connected with activists and national organizations who have called for a sharper public message from presidential candidates on issues relating to black and Latino communities.\n\nCastro has mentioned the names of gun violence victims in almost every one of his major public appearances, including his presidential announcement speech .\n\nDuring June\u2019s Democratic debate Castro pointed to high-profile victims of police shootings like Sandra Bland and Tamir Rice. At MSNBC\u2019s Gun Safety Forum in September he held up Laquan McDonald as an example of police violence as gun violence.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth,\u201d Castro said in Tuesday\u2019s debate, alluding to the early October killing of a young woman at the hands of law enforcement. \u201cI am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities because police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that.\u201d\n\nResponses from activists and other viewers to Castro\u2019s remarks catapulted his \u201cpolice violence is also gun violence\u201d soundbite to the most tweeted about moment of the evening , according to AdWeek.\n\nCastro\u2019s reference to Jefferson also resulted in increased traffic to his campaign website and a spike in fundraising, according to his campaign. Following his debate performance, his campaign traveled to Iowa to meet with community organizers and discuss policing and his plans for criminal justice reform.\n\nCastro, who is polling at 1% nationally , has not yet released his complete criminal justice reform plan but said during a racial profiling roundtable with organizers in Des Moines on Friday that he planned to do so before the end of the month.\n\nThose present for the discussion said his commitment to mitigating police violence is more clearly demonstrated than most other candidates.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Kamala] Harris who\u2019s really talking about policing. I think that\u2019s key,\u201d said Kameron Middlebrooks, president of the NAACP\u2019s Des Moines chapter, who attended a racial profiling roundtable with Castro. \u201cIf he can continue to get this message through, this could be something that really resonates. It\u2019s not high on people\u2019s minds as the weeks follow [the debates].\u201d\n\nCastro is not alone in offering plans to monitor and mitigate police violence into their policy platforms. Harris\u2019 criminal justice plan includes increased investigations into police misconduct and support of legislation to end racial profiling.\n\nButtigieg, who is polling at 1% with black voters, held meetings with social justice activists over the summer to discuss the fallout behind a fatal police shooting in South Bend, Ind., where he serves as mayor. In July, he released a Douglass Plan to mitigate racial inequality with a specific focus on African Americans.\n\n\u201cTransparency and justice for Laquan McDonald is more important than a campaign contribution. We are returning the money he contributed to the campaign and the money he has collected. He is no longer a co-host for the event and will not be attending,\u201d said Chris Meagher, Buttigieg\u2018s national press secretary.\n\nAdrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, an organization that advocates for increasing black voting power, said Castro has been out front on the issue of police violence.\n\n\"Castro is right on this: police violence is very much a part of the gun violence epidemic,\u201d she said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s been right on this issue. It\u2019s deeply meaningful to hear him honor the memory and say the names of the victims of police violence in campaign speeches and at every debate, something we didn\u2019t see in 2016. The rest of the candidates should follow.\"\n\nNolan McCaskill contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9d/46/ea2a89314843b4a6b73ba8c6f45f/20190901-julian-castro-listens-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
