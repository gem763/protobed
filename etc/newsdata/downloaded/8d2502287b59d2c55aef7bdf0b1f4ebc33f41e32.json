An eventual decision on Huawei, however, risks alienating one of them, with the U.S. warning of consequences if Brazil gives the Chinese technology company the go-ahead.\n\nChina\u2019s vast appetite for commodities helped drive up total trade between the two countries to $113 billion in 2018. The South American nation was China\u2019s eighth-biggest trading partner last year.\n\nChinese companies also invest heavily in Brazil, which is seeking foreign investors to participate in its privatization program to accelerate its sluggish economic growth. While the president will be accompanied by his foreign and agriculture ministers for this week\u2019s state visit, members of his economic team are set to come at a later date.\n\n\u201cThe absence of senior economic advisers suggest there won\u2019t be any major announcements besides a possible increase in commodity deals,\u201d said Hussein Kalout, a Harvard University political scientist and one of Brazil\u2019s leading scholars on international relations.\n\nAround 40% of Brazilian exports, mostly commodities, head to China, according to the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Bolsonaro wants to not only boost these numbers, but raise the country\u2019s export profile from commodities to higher-added-value products.\n\nRead more: China May Allow More Brazil Meat Plants for Exports, Group Says\n\nBolsonaro has long been a fan of U.S. President Donald Trump and he expressed skepticism over Beijing\u2019s investment prior to his election victory last year, saying the Chinese were allowed to \u201cbuy in Brazil, but not buy Brazil.\u201d Bolsonaro, however, has since toned down some of his criticism and adopted a pragmatic approach.\n\nIn May, he sent Vice President Hamilton Mourao to smooth over any awkwardness with Beijing. While there, Mourao met with Huawei\u2019s billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei and said that Brazil had no intention of restricting the firm\u2019s activities in the country. The company has been active in Brazil for over 20 years.\n\n\u201cSince assuming office, President Bolsonaro has attached importance to relationship with China, we appreciate that,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing last week while announcing the visit. A commentary published Thursday by China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency predicted the visit would \u201cinject new vitality into bilateral cooperation and advance joint efforts in improving global governance.\u201d\n\nHuawei\u2019s bid to build Brazil\u2019s 5G network is widely expected to be discussed, although Bolsonaro told journalists in Japan on Tuesday that the issue wasn\u2019t on his radar. Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo recently said Brazil would choose its 5G partner soon.\n\nAfter China, Bolsonaro is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where he\u2019ll seek further investments from local sovereign funds in renewable energy, defense and infrastructure. Brazil also seeks to calm Arab countries\u2019 anxieties over its unabashed support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cThe visit to the Gulf countries will demonstrate the possibilities of investment in Brazil and intensify relations after the president visited Israel,\u201d Ambassador Kenneth Nobrega, the head of the Middle East department at the foreign ministry, told reporters in Brasilia. \u201cThe countries of the region are major buyers of Brazilian agribusiness and there are also great prospects for the export of defense material to the region.\u201d", "description": "Bolsonaro Heads to China Amid Looming Question of Huawei Deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic86fcd2f4a885c9770dbd35bfa7283f7d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
