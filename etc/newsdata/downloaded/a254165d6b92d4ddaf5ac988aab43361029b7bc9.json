ANY of those-- just using the comic pages as storyboards-- would have made a far better movie than what they put up on the screen.'\n\nMeanwhile, he appeared to take issue with the inclusion of one scene in particular, writing: 'Just when you think the JOKER movie can't get any worse, they found a way to incorporate a scene we've already seen way too many times in... super hero movies. (If you saw JOKER, you know what I'm talking about.)\n\n'That was the rancid little cherry on top of this god awful sundae,' he bluntly added.\n\nHowever, Slott did concede that he found leading actor Joaquin Phoenix to be 'good' in the role of The Joker.\n\nMarvel writer Dan Slott didn't hold back when giving his review of Joker on Twitter\n\nThe comic book writer's opinions were met with a mixed reaction, much like the film itself - which has been fiercely dividing audiences since it opened across North America last week.\n\nThe film received tepid reviews in both The New York Times and The Washington Post, and have claimed that the violent film may encourage alienated young men to commit savage acts of violence - much like the movie's main character.\n\nHowever, others have applauded the film, with one Ivy League professor even considering including the film in his curriculum - describing it as 'a revelation'.\n\nThe film received tepid reviews in both The New York Times and The Washington Post, and have claimed that the violent film may encourage alienated young men to commit savage acts of violence\n\nJoker details how the character of Arthur Fleck was abused and neglected as a child, with University of Pennsylvania neurocriminologist Adrian Raine saying it depicts a realistic portrait.\n\n'[The film] was a surprisingly accurate prediction of the kind of background and circumstances which, when combined together, make a murderer,' Raine told Vanity Fair on Monday.\n\n'For 42 years, I've studied the cause of crime and violence. And while watching this film, I thought, 'Wow, what a revelation this was. I need to buy this movie down the road, make excerpt clips of it to illustrate'. t is a great educational tool about the making of the murderer'.\n\nMeanwhile, Joker continues to bring it big money at the box office, taking in an estimated $55 million in North America during its second weekend in cinemas.\n\nJoker's domestic box office take now totals $192.7 million\n\n'These are incredible numbers and really reflect how interested and excited people were,' said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore.\n\n'It shows that content wins. A great movie will rise up above all the noise over whatever controversy or security concerns there were,' he added. 'You're totally left out of the water cooler conversation if you haven't seen Joker.'\n\nInternationally, the Todd Phillips-directed comic book origin story starring Joaquin Phoenix added $123.7 million, bringing its global total to $543.9 million after just 12 days in theaters.", "description": "Slott - who  has penned popular Marvel titles including Fantastic Four and Tony Stark: Iron Man - shared a series of scathing tweets about the film over the weekend.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/02/19715644-0-image-a-8_1571103762709.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
