Depending on how it is used, it can lead businesses to lean on suppliers to accept discounts in exchange for early payment, and extend payment terms for suppliers that are owed money if they decline to participate.\n\nBut Mr Greensill claimed the concept of using technology to deliver cheaper money to small businesses was \"a great thing\" and that the Bundaberg-registered firm was trying to \"democratise capital.\"\n\nGreensill Capital founder and CEO Lex Greensill says the financial group's technology can help suppliers get paid faster. Peter Braig\n\n\"A lot of companies are fearful of making early payment options available to their suppliers because they\u2019re afraid of being pilloried for somehow being evil,\" he said.\n\n\"We\u2019re being prevented from giving cheap money to small businesses because of the fear that\u2019s going on in the market.\"\n\nGreensill Capital, headquartered in London, created its own technology that it integrates for free into the accounting systems of big corporations. It has several dozen customers in Australia including construction group CIMIC and Telstra \u2013 so it can track the invoices it is buying.\n\nIt claims this technology allows it to avoid the risk of fraudulent invoices or commercial disputes over payments .\n\nThe Australian economy would get \"a real shot in the arm\" if governments and companies used the technology in the same way that the British government does to speed up payment of invoices, Mr Greensill said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I absolutely am behind [Prime Minister Scott Morrison] in terms of we should be pushing more cash into the economy but actually technology, and technology and finance, has a huge role to play in actually making the systems work faster.\"\n\n'Delivering technology'\n\nGreensill Capital's financing role is more about enabling payments to suppliers than delaying them, Mr Greensill said. \"We\u2019re in the business of delivering the technology that does that.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister wants companies to pay small businesses more quickly, requiring companies working on Commonwealth contracts to pay invoices under $1 million in 20 days from July 2019.\n\nThe Committee for Economic Development of Australia's 2019 company pulse survey, released last week, found the general public placed a higher priority on the issue of prompt payment of small business suppliers than business respondents did.\n\nBut Mr Greensill argued there is a big gap between what politicians want to do and what actually happens, pointing to the UK.\n\n\"When Gordon Brown was prime minister, he announced that suppliers to government would get paid in 10 days. The reality is that the government pays within 10 days of approving an invoice. The problem is that on average it takes them more than 30-40 days to approve an invoice.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreensill had saved the UK's National Health Service over a quarter of a billion Australian dollars annually by giving cash to suppliers 60 days faster than they would otherwise have been, Mr Greensill claimed. \"We do that at a cost of funds that is significantly less than 1 per cent per annum.\"\n\nGreensill teamed up with technology group Taulia to finance a program that gives British pharmacies the option of receiving money due for the provision of pharmaceutical services earlier than the government would typically pay them.\n\nCredit ratings agencies and equity investors are wary of reverse factoring because it can allow companies to generate artificial working capital benefits. Accounting standards also do not enforce a distinction between whether the proceeds are presented within operating or financing cashflow, prompting Australia's accounting standards setter to raise questions about reverse factoring with international regulators.\n\nMoody's has likened the use of reverse factoring to a tiger trap in a jungle.\n\nBut Mr Greensill said a dollar of liability to a trade creditor was the same as a dollar of a liability to a financial institution.\n\n\u201cFor at least the last 30 years, for some odd reason the three major ratings agencies all have taken a view that for some reason trade creditors are somehow not a debt or liability,\" he said.\n\n\u201cWhen they tot up the indebtedness of the company, they ignore the credit provided by their suppliers. That is complete craziness. There is no economic justification for that.\u201d", "description": "The Australian government should use Greensill's technology and financing services to pay suppliers faster, says Lex Greensill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5104%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_764%2C$y_320/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e331c0e19dbdcf26f0c07ed85fa83061387938bf", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
