The rookie drove in four runs and scored three times.\n\n\"I did know my dad had one,\" Cavan Biggio said. \"I have a ticket to the game he got it in in my room my whole life. I didn't think I was going to get up there for the opportunity.\"\n\nHe got his first hit off Chandler Shepherd, the second against Shawn Armstrong, the third versus Richard Bleier and the last off Mychal Givens.\n\nCraig Biggio hit for the cycle at Colorado's Coors Field on April 8, 2002, as part of a career that earned him induction into the Hall of Fame.

A triple is hard to get in this ballpark. He was really going all out rounding second. He's aggressive at the plate and he's really doing better.\"\n\nTrey Mancini and Jonathan Villar homered for last-place Baltimore, which lost for the third time in four games and dropped to 49-102.\n\nMancini finished with four RBIs. He hit his 34th homer in the first and snapped a tie with a run-scoring single off Justin Shafer in the seventh.\n\n\"I think everybody wants to finish the year strong,\" Mancini said. \"It sounds clich\u00e9 but it's honestly what I think about when I go up to the plate is to do what I can to help the team win and try to have a good at-bat.\"\n\nThe Blue Jays tied the game again when Biggio doubled, stole third and scored on a sacrifice fly by Lourdes Gurriel Jr. in the eighth.\n\nJustin Smoak put Toronto ahead when homered off Givens (2-6) leading off the ninth, Smoak's 21st homer and first since Aug. 27.\n\nBiggio tacked on two more runs with a triple to before an error by Villar at shortstop allowed the eighth run to score.\n\nDerek Law (1-2) pitched a scoreless eighth inning.\n\nRandal Grichuk hit his 10th homer in 26 games against Baltimore.\n\nVillar hit his 22nd home run off Ken Giles in the ninth.\n\nOrioles manager Brandon Hyde was not happy about several gaffes his team made on the bases and defensively.\n\n\"I feel like for the most part this year we've competed our tails off. Just fell short quite a few times,\" Hyde said. \"I just thought we made a lot of mistakes tonight. I thought we played like a really tired team. We need better effort.\"\n\nREED\n\nFormer Baltimore Ravens safety and NFL Hall of Famer Ed Reed threw out a ceremonial first pitch \u2014 a strike down the middle.
