The short-term impact would be limited, he said.\n\nWednesday also sees the ECB's introduction of tiered rates, to help mitigate the effect of negative interest rates on banks.\n\nEuro zone bond yields across most maturities rose as much as 2 basis points in early trade - possibly boosted by Spanish inflation data which came in marginally above expectations.\n\nGermany's 10-year bond yield was last up around 1.5 bps on at -0.34%, near Monday's three-month high of -0.32%. It is up 22 bps so far in October and set for its biggest monthly jump since early 2018, largely driven by expectations that Britain will avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nData from the German state of Saxony showed consumer prices rose by 1% year-on-year in October. A nationwide inflation report is expected later in the day.\n\nBut the bigger focus for markets was the Fed, which concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday. A rate cut is widely expected, but attention will be focused on any hints about future policy.\n\nOmitting the reference that the Fed \"will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion\" would be a signal that the Fed is done with its precautionary rate cuts,\" Commerzbank's head of rates and credit research, Christoph Rieger, wrote in a note.
