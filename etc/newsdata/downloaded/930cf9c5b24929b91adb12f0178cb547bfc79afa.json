Vilnius, Lithuania\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\n\nAverage price per person: \u00a337.98 a night\n\nVilnius is already hailed as one of the cheapest European city breaks so it's no surprise that the Lithuanian capital has been revealed as a great value hotspot in January.\n\nThere's heaps to explore from the fairytale-esque Trakai Island Castle to the impressive 16th century Gate of Dawn, as well as the Old Town with its cosy caf\u00e9s and historic architecture.\n\nThe best part is that some of the top attractions such as the Church of St Anne are free, while the museums and art galleries often have entrance fees that work out at less than \u00a33pp.\n\n3. Athens, Greece\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAverage price per person: \u00a350.27 a night\n\nYes, the weather will be hot and sunny if you head in the summer, while in January you could face some rain.\n\nBut if you're not fussed about the heat, winter can be ideal for visiting Athens; there are very few tourists, meaning the museums and sites tend to be fairly empty.\n\nPlus, with average temperatures around 13 degrees, it won't be so freezing that you can't go out and explore.\n\nYou may also want to check out our Athens city guide with more top tips on the best things to see and do while you're in the city.\n\n4.

Sofia, Bulgaria\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAverage price per person: \u00a343.17 a night\n\nSofia has cold weather and heavy snow in the winter, but that can make the city seem idyllic - and most of the highlights are indoors anyway.\n\nThe Alexander Nevski Cathedral needs to be on your radar, while the National Historical Museum of Bulgaria is home to some pretty fascinating exhibits.\n\nFull list of best value city break destinations for January", "description": "Best value city breaks for January that are ideal if you're looking to kick off 2020 in style but you're on a post-Christmas budget", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20577730.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Alexander-Nevski-Cathedral-Sofia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
