Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nTurkey\u2019s military moves have sparked bipartisan backlash in Washington, with many saying it puts Kurdish allies who fought with the U.S. against ISIS in danger. Several lawmakers have announced their intention to introduce sanctions against Ankara over the operation.\n\nTrump has already introduced sanctions of his own, saying in a statement he is slapping sanctions on government officials in Ankara and \u201cany persons contributing to Turkey\u2019s destabilizing actions in northeast Syria.\u201d The sanctions include an increase on steel tariffs from 25 percent to 50 percent and a halt in trade negotiations with Turkey.\n\nHowever, lawmakers have also trained their ire on Trump over his decision to withdraw troops from northeastern Syria ahead of the offensive, which many said lifted the chief deterrent to Turkey\u2019s operation.\n\nSen.
