About 32 percent said they used only THC vaping products, and about 13 percent told investigators they used only nicotine products, the CDC said.\n\nOf 1,043 patients with demographic data available, 70 percent of patients are male and about 80 percent of the patients are under age 35. Thirty-six percent were younger than 20 years old, the agency said.\n\nThe ages of the patients who have died range from 17 to 75, the agency said, with a median age of 49.\n\nNational health agencies have recommended that people stop using vapes altogether until the investigation is complete.\n\nA Massachusetts judge last week declined to temporarily lift Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker\u2019s four-month ban on the sale of all vaping products in the state. A Michigan ban on flavored vapes was also challenged in court this week.\n\nLast week, the Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into the marketing practices of the six largest e-cigarette manufacturers, including Juul. The FTC is investigating whether some of the largest companies were engaging in marketing practices, including flavored vapes, specifically targeting children.", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 The number of deaths connected to vaping-related lung injury has soared to 26, and the number of confirmed and probable cases has", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
