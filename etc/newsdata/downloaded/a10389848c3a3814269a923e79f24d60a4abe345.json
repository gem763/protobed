But he\u2019s not at all popular in Iowa.

In particular, Selzer showed Elizabeth Warren (22 percent) moving ahead of Joe Biden (20 percent), and having double the level of support as third-place Bernie Sanders (11 percent). No other candidate was in double figures, and fourth-placed Pete Buttigieg (9 percent) lost six points since the last Iowa poll in June. So the bottom line was continued churn among the Big Three, with Warren showing the most momentum, but with not much shaking lower on the long list of candidates.\n\nBut Selzer also compiled favorable/unfavorable ratios for the candidates, and a look at them may help to discern which of today\u2019s bottom-feeders have true dark horse potential, and which are probably going nowhere fast. Nine active candidates have positive net favorability numbers among likely caucus-goers:\n\nWarren +58 Buttigieg +56 Harris +39 Booker +38 Biden +37 Klobuchar +30 O\u2019Rourke +28 Sanders +22 Yang +6\n\nBut nine others are underwater:\n\nCastro -1 Bennet -3 Bullock -5 Gabbard -5 Steyer -5 Sestak -14 Ryan -15 Delaney -17 Williamson -39\n\nTwo of the candidates with net negative favorability ratings (Castro and Steyer) have qualified for the October debates, and one other (Gabbard) is one qualifying poll away from making the stage with eight days left before the deadline.\n\nYes, this is just one poll from one state, albeit a highly regarded poll from the single-most important state, but it provides some evidence that below the Big Three are five who are making enough of a positive impression on Iowa Democrats that a late surge isn\u2019t at all out of the question. And actually, all of the those five have higher net favorability numbers than Bernie Sanders, which increases the bad news he got from Selzer.\n\nNot many pollsters offer favorability/unfavorability ratings for the entire field, but one national tracking poll that does, Morning Consult, offers a somewhat different take, from findings collected just after the September debate. It shows only one candidate, Marianne Williamson, having an underwater favorability ratio (-6). Here\u2019s the rest of the field (Morning Consult didn\u2019t bother to poll Joe Sestak):\n\nSanders +59 Biden +54 Warren +52 Harris +38 Buttigieg +33 O\u2019Rourke +31 Booker +30 Yang +22 Klobuchar +21 Castro +11 Gabbard +11 Steyer +8 Bennet +6 Bullock +6 Delaney +3 Ryan +1\n\nThe rankings are pretty similar, with the exception of a big difference of opinion over Bernie Sanders (the most popular candidate nationally, per MC, but only the eighth most popular in Iowa, per Selzer), and some less dramatic divergences over candidates in the middle of the pack like Yang and Klobuchar (much more popular, unsurprisingly, in next-door Iowa).\n\nAt this point you\u2019d have to figure October-debate non-qualifiers Bennet, Bullock, Delaney, Ryan, and Sestak are pretty toasty, with possible qualifier Gabbard and qualifiers Castro and Steyer not looking so hot, either. Yang\u2019s on the bubble, as is Klobuchar, though her relative strength in Iowa could keep her aloft. But if you\u2019re looking for a dark horse at this point, it\u2019s probably going to be from the group that includes Booker, Buttigieg, Harris, and O\u2019Rourke. So in your mental road-map of the race you should probably add a Little Four to the Big Three. And if Cory Booker\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t bluffing in its recent distress signal about fundraising, the list of plausible dark horses could soon shrink further.", "description": "Favorability ratios for the Democratic presidential field show an emerging Little Four of candidates (Booker, Buttigieg, Harris and O\u2019Rourke) with enough popularity to become feasible dark horse threats to the Big Three (Biden, Sanders, Warren).", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/23/23-kamala-harris.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
