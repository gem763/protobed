We hope as we move forward we will be able to conclude very soon an agreement that would allow Sudan to be delisted.\u201d\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed support at the Sudan event, held on the sidelines of the General Assembly, for Hamdok\u2019s efforts. He called for the immediate removal of \u201cSudan\u2019s designation as a terrorist-supporting state and lifting all economic sanctions and mobilizing massive financial support for development to make the current political gains durable.\u201d\n\nShortages of bread, fuel and medicine coupled with hefty price rises sparked protests that led to the toppling of longtime ruler Bashir in April.

It will launch a nine-month economic rescue plan in October aimed at curbing rampant inflation while ensuring supplies of basic goods. It is also asking the World Bank for $2 billion.\n\n\u201cThe new Sudan that is upholding governance and democracy is not a threat to any nation in the world,\u201d Hamdok said.\n\nA senior U.S. official said in August that Washington would test the commitment of Sudan\u2019s new transitional government to human rights, freedom of speech and humanitarian access before it agrees to remove the country from a list of state sponsors of terrorism. [nL2N25M1FL]\n\nThe U.S. State Department was not immediately available for comment on Friday.\n\nSudan was designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993 under then-U.S. President Bill Clinton, cutting it off from financial markets and strangling its economy, over allegations that Bashir\u2019s Islamist government was supporting terrorism, notably attacks in Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nWashington lifted a 20-year trade embargo against Sudan in 2017 and was in the process of discussions on removing it from the U.S. list when the military stepped in on April 11 to depose Bashir.\n\nThe Trump administration suspended talks on normalizing relations with Sudan and demanded that the military hand power to a civilian government.\n\nA senior European diplomat said the U.S. government considered that the new government had to assume the responsibilities of the previous administration.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Americans are ready yet. They still think that today\u2019s Sudan must pay for the crimes of yesterday\u2019s Sudan when it comes to legal cases out there related to the terrorist attacks in Nairobi or Dar es Salaam,\u201d said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard on the Sudanese, so the key is finding a formula to resolve this,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cIf we can unlock that, then it will open the door for the whole (transitional) process.\u201d", "description": "Sudan's prime minister said on Friday he had held useful talks with U.S. officials while at the United Nations this week, and expressed hope Khartoum could reach an agreement to be removed from Washington's state-sponsored terrorism list \"very soon.\"", "authors": ["John Irish", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435213532&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0JK-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
