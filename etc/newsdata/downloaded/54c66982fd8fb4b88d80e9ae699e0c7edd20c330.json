The idea was swiftly rejected by Corbyn, who called it \u201cTom\u2019s view\u201d.\n\nRemain-minded campaigners are set to push the issue at the conference. A majority of the Brexit motions submitted have been put forward either by Another Europe is Possible or two other groups, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour.\n\nMichael Chessum from Another Europe is Possible said: \u201cLabour members are the secret weapon of the party at a general election, and the party ignores them at its peril.\n\nLabour activists pledge to create most radical manifesto ever Read more\n\n\u201cSupport for an explicit remain stance is evidently overwhelming. If backroom manoeuvres are deployed to stop this being debated on conference floor it will be a disaster for morale and for Labour\u2019s prospects.\n\n\u201cWe need a debate and a vote at conference. Only if Labour can get clarity on this part of its policy can it fight the election on its domestic agenda.\u201d\n\nPolling has indicated that the mass Labour membership is notably more remain-minded than the party\u2019s official policy, with one survey from January saying 72% sought a second referendum, and 88% saying they would back remain if one was held.", "description": "Vast majority of motions submitted call for party to explicitly back remain", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Zoe Williams", "Joseph Harker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af3ed3073d9194da209741504e23f4d9493d4477/98_90_3421_2054/master/3421.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f44f5c9260e674aa13379eeb20085eef", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
