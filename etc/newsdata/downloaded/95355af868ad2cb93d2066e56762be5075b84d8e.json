Lately there has been much buzz about a mystery lung disease caused by \u201cvaping\u201d \u2014 but what it actually seems to be caused by is contaminated materials sold through illegitimate channels, including many that deliver THC instead of nicotine. Banning flavors would enlarge this market, and also encourage vapers to try to mix in flavorings themselves. One hopes they would find it easy to figure out which ingredients are safe to inhale and which are not. One is not too hopeful, however.\n\nThere\u2019s also the tiny matter of the government telling everyone, including adults, what to do. Even if we take it at face value that teen vaping is a problem that demands government action beyond the minimum-age requirement already in place, there are ways to reduce it that don\u2019t affect those of age \u2014 harsher punishments for selling to minors, information campaigns, even raising the age for flavored vapes to, say, 21 to reduce the number of minors who have friends who can buy them legally. But the administration has decided that if some teens are going to illegally vape liquids with names like Fruity Hoops, well then, no one can. One does not need to be a dyed-in-the-wool libertarian to be disgusted at this affront to personal freedom and responsibility.", "description": "", "authors": ["Robert Verbruggen", "Nationalreview.Com Hands-Off-The-Fruity-E-Cigs"], "top_image": ""}
