It was his fine cross which allowed Holgate to emphatically head Everton into the quarter final.\n\nFor Silva, it was a vital contribution. \u201cTheo played a huge part this evening again - the change we made at half time had a big impact,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe allowed us to build our attacks quicker, and the gaps were bigger. He helped Alex Iwobi have a bigger impact, too. Theo was really important for us.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cTheo was always a really important player for me, even sometimes when he was not playing and starting the games. He deserved it. He is in a good moment, a really important player us.\u201d\n\nWhen Richarlison confirmed victory in stoppage time, it was no more than Everton deserved\u2026or rather Watford deserved, for a hugely unambitious performance which seemed to be based solely on the idea of going to penalties.\n\nIt created a woeful first half, notable only for the commitment of the visitors to sucking all life from the contest; straight from a Harry Potter novel, but half neon.\n\nThe first shot on target arrived a minute before half time, summing up the frigid game. But when Silva hooked the disappointing Moise Kean for Walcott during the break, things warmed up.\n\nIt was Holgate\u2019s first goal for his club which hauled it out of the deep freeze. Before then, Alex Iwobi and Lucas Digne had seen deflected shots cannon off the cross bar, and Andre Gomes a shot cleared from the line by Mariappa.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nWhen Watford failed to clear a corner, Walcott darted onto the loose ball on the left, and crossed back in for Holgate - who is making a fair fist of grabbing a regular first team place - to ram a ferocious header home.\n\nWith Watford finally forced to break their defensive shackles, it left space for Everton to break, and Richardson ran from the half way line onto a well timed ball from Cenk Tosun to cooly finish.", "description": "The Toffees eased the pressure on their under-fire manager by beating the Hornets 2-0 and progress to the Carabao Cup quarter-finals", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20753599.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Carabao-Cup-Fourth-Round-Everton-v-Watford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
