It\u2019s code (issa dorky pun, don\u2019t get too upset about the spelling) Cascadia Code, and you can already try it out.\n\n\u201cIt is the latest monospaced font shipped from Microsoft and provides a fresh experience for command line experiences and code editors,\u201d wrote Microsoft program manager Kayla Cinnamon in a blog post. Cascadia Code was built especially for the new Windows Terminal application, but Cinnamon says it ought to pair just fine with other terminal apps and text editors, like Visual Studio an Visual Studio Code.\n\nThe new font inherited its name from the pre-release codename given to Windows Terminal, namely Cascadia. The Windows-maker later decided to add \u2018Code\u2018 to its name to indicate it was intended for devs. It\u2019s also entirely open source.\n\nOne cool thing is that Cascadia Code supports ligatures. \u201cProgramming ligatures are most useful when writing code, as they create new glyphs by combining characters,\u201d Cinnamon adds. \u201cThis helps make code more readable and user-friendly for some people.\u201d\n\nAnyone itching to give Cascadia Code a test drive can grab it from its GitHub repository. For anyone else, the font will automatically make its way to the next iteration of Windows Terminal. And for those looking to implement it in Visual Studio, you\u2019ll find instructions on how to do that here.\n\nvia Thurrot\n\nRead next: Ethereum 'ICO architect' arrested over alleged $12M cryptocurrency extortion", "description": "Microsoft has crafted a new font specifically built with developers in mind.
