Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District\u2019s nonvoting representative in Congress, said that once the Washington, D.C. Admission Act is passed in the Democrat-controlled House, the version in the Republican-led Senate will gain more co-sponsors.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even worry about McConnell, he will not be there much longer,\u201d Mrs. Norton said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican and a staunch opponent of D.C. statehood.\n\nEarlier this year, Mrs. Norton introduced the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which calls for establishing the District as the state of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, with full congressional representation \u2014 i.e., two senators and a voting House member.\n\nThe House version of the statehood bill (H.R. 51) has more than 200 co-sponsors, and the Senate version (S.B. 631) has just over 30.\n\nSenior Republicans on the House Oversight Committee have indicated that D.C. Council member Jack Evans\u2019 ethics scandal could hurt the District\u2019s chances at statehood.\n\nReps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina sent a letter Monday to Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, Maryland Democrat and committee chairman, urging him to invite Mr. Evans to testify at Thursday\u2019s hearing.\n\nThe committee is scheduled to hear from Miss Bowser; D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson; D.C. Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey DeWitt; Kenneth Thomas, a legislative attorney at the Congressional Research Service; and Kerwin Miller, a veteran and District resident.\n\n\u201cIn light of allegations that Evans exploited his official position with the DC government to engage in self-dealing for personal financial gain, Members must fully understand the nature and extent of Evans\u2019s action to properly assess and consider H.R. 51,\u201d the House Republicans wrote in the letter.\n\nMiss Bowser said Monday that she won\u2019t be \u201ctricked\u201d into the discussion of statehood focused on Mr. Evans.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be dissuaded by anybody that wants to focus on one person, or one man, when we are talking about 700,000 people who pay taxes and who do not have a vote in that congress and do not have two senators,\u201d the Democratic mayor said.\n\nBernie Siler, a veteran of Operation Joint Endeavor and Afghanistan, said the fact that he served the country while he and other residents didn\u2019t have representation in Congress speaks to his \u201cloyalty and love\u201d of the country.\n\n\u201cWe did what we were told, we went where we were sent knowing we had no voice in those decisions, so for this bill to be passed would mean vindication for all the years of injustice,\u201d said Mr. Siler, who lives in Ward 4.\n\nPeggy Gilgannon, a 70-year-old retired news photographer in Ward 6, was one of more than a hundred people who attended Monday\u2019s rally. She said she feels like a \u201csecond-class citizen\u201d who is not \u201callowed to have her own viewpoints\u201d because Congress has the power to disapprove of D.C. legislation.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in D.C. is not American,\u201d Ms. Gilgannon said.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, Congress is authorized to administer the District as the seat of the federal government. All D.C. laws must first be approved by Congress to take effect.\n\nThe statehood movement has waxed and waned over decades without success regardless of which party has controlled Congress and the White House.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
