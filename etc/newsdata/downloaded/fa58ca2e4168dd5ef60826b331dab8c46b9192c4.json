(NASDAQ: ) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 18, 2019 $15 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\n\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\n\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\n\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\n\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Flexion Therapeutics shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Flexion Therapeutics is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Drugs industry that ranks in the Top 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has narrowed from a loss of 98 cents per share to a loss of $1.01.\n\n\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Flexion Therapeutics right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.
