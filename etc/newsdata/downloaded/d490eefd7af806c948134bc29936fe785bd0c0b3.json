Stand up fight back!\u201d and carrying a sign reading, \u201cHate is not normal.\u201d\n\nSanctuary DMV activists claimed responsibility for the disruption, writing online, \u201cwe denied DHS Acting Secretary McAleenan the opportunity to justify the unjustifiable to an audience of DC immigration wonks & lawyers\u201d and demanding the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency be abolished.\n\nIn response to the protest, McAleenan said:\n\nThe First Amendment guarantees all Americans the right to free speech and assembly. Unfortunately that right was robbed from many who were scheduled to speak and attend today\u2019s event at Georgetown. Unfortunately the Acting Secretary and the audience did not get the opportunity to engage in a robust dialogue this morning due to the disruptions of a few activists. [Emphasis added]\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, McAleenan recently aired a number of grievances that he had with President Trump\u2019s \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d policy at the southern border, fellow Trump officials, and terms like \u201cillegal alien,\u201d which he said he refuses to use because it carries \u201cracial overtones.\u201d\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
