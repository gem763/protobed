This is a new EU treaty. It\u2019s slightly better than Mrs May\u2019s abject surrender, but when Boris says to you, \u2018This gets Brexit done,\u2019 it sounds wonderful.\n\n\u201cMonsieur Barnier said the next phase of negotiations would last for a minimum of three years. You\u2019ve got to ask yourself: do you believe Boris Johnson or do you believe Michel Barnier?\n\n\u201cThis is not Brexit. This treaty will lead to years and years of acrimony and us still being part of European institutions. It will never free us completely from the European Court of Justice. This is not Brexit.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released on Tuesday night, the Brexit campaigner warned that as well as ECJ judges still being able to override British law, during the extendable transition period, \u201cwe won\u2019t withdraw from the EU at all but become non-voting members.\n\n\u201cWe will still be trapped in the EU Customs Union and Single Market, subject to all existing EU laws and any punitive new ones they might pass.\u201d\n\nThe agreement and political declaration will also mean that UK fishing waters will still open to European fishermen during the transition; Britain must \u201cstick[] to EU rules\u201d in order to abide by Brussels\u2019 demand to ensure a \u2018level playing field\u2019 in commerce; and accept the restriction of British sovereignty whereby the UK is prevented from \u201ctaking \u2018any action likely to conflict with or impede\u2019 EU foreign policy\u201d, Mr Farage said.\n\nThe Brexit Party leader reiterated his offer of a pact with the Conservatives if the prime minister abandons the pursuit of an exit treaty and embraces no deal, otherwise Mr Farage will field candidates in every seat in the country. With Number 10 indicating that it may pursue an election strategy if the EU grants a Brexit delay, that challenge may come sooner rather than later.\n\nBoris Johnson says that the new EU treaty gets Brexit done, but Mr Barnier says the next negotiations will last for 3 years or longer. Who do you believe? \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) October 23, 2019\n\nPredicting a New Year election, Mr Farage said on Sky News: \u201cA general election does give Boris Johnson the opportunity to say: \u2018We\u2019ve tried with Mrs May and with myself to get a new EU treaty through. Let\u2019s drop that, and get a different approach.\u2019 That is what I very much hope he would do.\n\n\u201cIf he does that then, of course, my attitude towards standing against many Conservatives would be different. But on the current course, of course, we\u2019ll stand against them because only the Brexit Party will actually represent genuinely leaving the institutions of the European Union. That\u2019s what the vote was all about.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Boris Johnson decides to drop the treaty and we see the beginnings of a Brexit alliance fighting that election, it would win a thumping majority. Then, we really would get Brexit done,\u201d he added.", "description": "Nigel Farage has warned that Boris Johnson's bill \"is not Brexit\" and has urged the prime minister to join forces with his Brexit Party.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Nigel-Farage-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
