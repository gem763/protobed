It was signed by the chairmen of the committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight.\n\nThe letter follows a report published in The Washington Post on Tuesday that revealed that Pence\u2019s national security advisor was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump urged Zelensky on the call to investigate his 2020 rival Joe Biden, the former vice president. On Thursday, CNN reported that Pence was provided a transcript of the phone call the day after it took place. A source told CNN that Pence \u201cmay or may have not read it.\u201d\n\nCiting the public reporting, the committee chairmen wrote in the letter that it \u201cremains unclear to what extent you had knowledge of the specific aspects of some of these events.\u201d\n\nAlso under scrutiny is Pence\u2019s Sept. 1 meeting with Zelensky in Warsaw, Poland. According to the Post report, Trump instructed Pence to inform Zelensky that Washington would not release military aid Congress had allocated to the country unless the leader committed to fighting corruption.\n\nIn a statement, Pence\u2019s press secretary Katie Waldman said that the vice president received the letter after it was released to the media.\n\n\u201cGiven the scope, it does not appear to be a serious request but just another attempt by the Do Nothing Democrats to call attention to their partisan impeachment,\u201d Waldman said. \u201cDespite their efforts to distract and obstruct our agenda, this Administration will stay focused on creating jobs, securing the border, rebuilding our military, negotiating better trade deals, and the issues most important to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe committees requested a broad range of documents related to Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, as well as second call that took place in April.\n\nThe Democrats asked for all \u201crecordings, transcripts, notes,\u201d of the calls as well as the names of all the people who were on the calls or who had a role in transcribing them. They also requested all communications related to the calls between current or formal officials in the White House, the Department of Justice, the Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the various intelligence agencies.\n\nThe committee heads also asked Pence to turn over documents related to his meeting with Zelensky in September, including any communications about the meeting with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, White House senior advisor Jared Kushner and others.\n\nThe committee chairmen warned Pence in the letter that failure to turn over the documents they requested \u201cshall constitute evidence of obstruction\u201d in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry has moved at a brisk pace since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her support for it last month. The three committees have subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Giuliani for documents related to the probe, and have threatened to issue a subpoena to the White House if it fails to comply with their requests.", "description": "House Democrats on Friday demanded that Vice President Mike Pence turn over documents related to President Donald Trump's call with the Ukrainian president at the heart of their rapidly unfolding impeachment probe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIiCJI.img?h=158&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1200&y=653", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
