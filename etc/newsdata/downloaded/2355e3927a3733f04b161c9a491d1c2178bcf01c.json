Edwina Pickles\n\nEighteen months after that, Telstra's old residential copper network will be switched off, meaning most households will either have to migrate onto the NBN or forgo fixed line broadband altogether. If prices are too high, there are concerns lower income households will be forced to fall back on their mobile plans.\n\nThe ACCC flagged its pricing concerns in April, saying that by focusing on encouraging take-up of its higher speed plans, NBN Co had neglected customers with lower speed needs.\n\nThe Australian Communications Consumer Action Network has echoed these concerns, warning that \"if prices go up any more, there's going to be a significant portion of the community excluded from getting an NBN service\".\n\nLast month, NBN Co changed its pricing structure for its entry level 12 Mbps product, partly in response to the ACCC's concerns. While the initial cost will remain the same at $22.50 per month, the cost for users that exceed the very modest bandwidth inclusion will be dramatically reduced.\n\n'Superficially good'\n\nUnder the new pricing, retailers can buy the entry level product with 1Mbps of bandwidth, or \"CVC\", for $35 a month. CVC is often described as the 'on-ramp' onto the NBN's network. The more CVC an NBN retailer buys, the more traffic it can get onto the network, lowering the likelihood of congestion at times of peak demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Sims said under the old pricing, while 12 Mbps plans looked \"superficially good\", they had insufficient bandwidth. \"If you used it as people use ADSL, you\u2019d quickly pay a lot more,\" he said.\n\nHe said a number of retailers had told the ACCC that they couldn't make the entry level product stack up economically under the NBN's current pricing.\n\nMr Sims said the latest pricing was \"much closer to the mark\". \"Now we need to test that in an open and transparent way. Had they not done that [changed the pricing], we may have moved to do something more decisive\u201d.\n\nAn NBN Co spokesman said: \"We welcome any additional options the ACCC may identify through its access pricing inquiry to promote competition and the interests of customers, while allowing NBN Co the opportunity to grow its revenues and re-invest in the network.\"\n\nNBN users pay more\n\nNBN Co must meet an internal rate of return of 3.2 per cent if it is to pay for itself and avoid a writedown. Chief executive Stephen Rue said he hoped to achieve this by encouraging customers to move onto higher speed plans, as well as increasing NBN Co's revenue from business customers.\n\nComparison website Canstar Blue's telco editor Tara Donnelly said her organisation's research showed NBN customers were on average paying more than ADSL users.\n\n\"A recent survey of broadband users conducted by Canstar Blue showed that, on average, NBN customers spend $77 per month on their plan, compared to $72 per month for ADSL and cable users,\" she said.\n\n\"Forty per cent of respondents to Canstar Blue\u2019s survey pay more for their NBN plan than their previous connection, and 18 per cent of NBN customers have considered ditching the service altogether for home wireless or similar alternatives.\"", "description": "The competition and consumer watchdog has launched an investigation into whether NBN is failing customers that don't want or need high speed internet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_106/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4562618b24c2b26f0c2a3c30945d0fb4f217c2c6", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
