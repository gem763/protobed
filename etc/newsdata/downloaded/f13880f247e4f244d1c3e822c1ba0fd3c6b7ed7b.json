It wasn't broken, but it also wasn't not broken \u2014 we just needed something more grown-up. Our next pick had to fit just three small requirements \u2014 it couldn't cost a ton (hey, we're already paying NYC rent!), it had to be sturdy enough to last at least one move (there's no such thing as a single-use bed frame), and it had to have a headboard (a clear sign of \"adulting\"). This Zinus bed frame nailed all three.\n\nIt has a 4.7 star rating on Amazon and it's easy to see why \u2014 the price is reasonable, the overall look is quite classic, and it's really easy to assemble.\n\nAt $205, the bed isn't dirt cheap, but it's also not an investment piece, either. It's a reasonable price for something that doesn't have an immediately recognizable brand name or brick-and-mortar location where you can check out the quality in person.\n\nSince we were moving, we also applied for the Amazon movers' coupon. It's a 10% discount off all items sold by Amazon (as in, Amazon, the seller, and not just Amazon, the site) capped at $200 for 90 days. To apply, you just have to fill out a change of address form with the USPS in person for free or online for $1. Once verified, you can buy everything you need to furnish your next apartment at a pretty sweet discount.\n\nRead more: The best mattresses you can buy\n\nZinus\n\nThe Zinus bed comes in a twin, full, queen, and king size, and in dark and sage gray. We have the dark gray, but both are neutral colors that can match any room's vibe. The diamond pattern in the headboard is a low-key elevated touch that makes you wonder if it's a West Elm piece, because it definitely doesn't look like it's from IKEA. And speaking of the headboard, it also has a handy zippered compartment behind it that's perfect for holding the instruction booklet and assembly tools, so you won't lose them. We also use the space to store extra (read: old) bed sheets and pillowcases.\n\nLike with most other furniture, the bed came with easy pictorial instructions and all the tools you'd need to put it together \u2014 which is basically a teeny-tiny hex key that you'll drop every other turn because it's so small. Thankfully, the instructions are easy enough so using a tool meant for a child's hand is the only frustrating part of putting the bed together.\n\nRead more: 21 helpful products we've bought for our apartments\n\nZinus\n\nAnother thing we also really liked was the customer service, though not all the reviews will agree with us on this. Our bed arrived in a few days with Prime shipping and a cracked leg, which meant we couldn't use it the night we got it, so we left feedback about the problem on Amazon and it promptly sent over a whole new set of legs. They arrived fine and have held up, so if anyone needs extras, hit me up.\n\nFor $205, the queen-sized Zinus bed is a pretty good buy. It's reasonably priced for something a step above your college furniture and will last a few years, or at least a few moves. It also means that we won't regret it too much if we decide to upgrade our bed again in a few years.", "description": "If you want a bed frame that adds a luxurious aesthetic to your bedroom without a hefty price tag, the $205 Zinus Shalini model is the way to go.", "authors": ["Jada Wong"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c4f22ed2bdd7f40470f747b-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
