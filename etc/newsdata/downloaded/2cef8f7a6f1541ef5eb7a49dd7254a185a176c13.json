(Brendan McDermid/Reuters )\n\nMSNBC anchor Chris Hayes on Monday admonished the network for allegedly suppressing former NBC journalist Ronan Farrow\u2019s expose on Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct.\n\nHayes, in the closing segment of his Monday night broadcast, described the allegations detailed in Farrow\u2019s new book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d which was released Tuesday. In the book, Farrow accuses NBC News executives of killing the Weinstein story after he spent seven months reporting it due to concerns that Weinstein would expose former Today Show host Matt Lauer\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nNBC President Noah Oppenheim has denied Farrow\u2019s allegations.\n\nAfter presenting Farrow\u2019s and Oppenheim\u2019s positions, Hayes went on to imply that NBC must bear some responsibility for allowing Farrow to leave the network just two months before he broke the Weinstein story in another publication.\n\n\u201cOne thing\u2026is indisputable,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cFarrow walked out of NBC News after working on the Weinstein story and within two months published an incredible article in the New Yorker, that not only won a Pulitzer but helped trigger a massive social and cultural reckoning that continues to this day.\n\n\u201cIt is the kind of journalism that you want to do as a journalist,\u201d he continued.\n\nPlease watch this excellent closing statement by @chrislhayes To stand up this way against his bosses at NBC News is remarkable I should note what makes this even more remarkable is Andy Lack (NBC News Chairman) isn't a big fan of Chris/his show Chris is stepping out here pic.twitter.com/vXnQkJd4eq \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 15, 2019\n\nOppenheim on Monday sent a letter to NBC employees strenuously denying that the company suppressed Farrow\u2019s story on Weinstein to keep a lid on allegations against Lauer, calling the charge a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nFarrow hit back at Oppenheim during a Monday interview on the View, saying he had a \u201cpaper trail\u201d to prove his allegations.", "description": "NBC President Noah Oppenheim has denied Farrow's allegations.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Katherine Timpf", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
