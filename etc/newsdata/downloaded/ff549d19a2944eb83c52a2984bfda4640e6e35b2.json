So I think we appreciated the fact that our helicopters, our planes weren't molested,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nAfter teasing a major announcement the day before, Trump confirmed reports Sunday that Baghdadi had died in a raid by U.S. special forces \u2014 using vivid and gory detail to describe the self-declared caliph\u2019s final moments.\n\n\"The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president later gave his acknowledgments: \u201cI want to thank the nations of Russia, Syria, Turkey and Iraq, and I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us.\u201c\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s death comes amid debate in Washington over Trump\u2019s withdrawal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, a move that allowed Turkey to invade the region. It\u2019s also a move that many have called a betrayal of U.S.-allied Kurds who have been on the front lines of the fight against ISIS.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds played an important role in the operation, and we are grateful for the Kurds and the [Syrian Democratic Forces] and our allies there,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on NBC.\n\nLater in the interview, he added that Russia still presents a \u201cgreat danger\u201d to the U.S. But sometimes, O\u2019Brien said, American interests \u201coverlap\u201d with Russian interests \u2014 and there is no reason the two countries shouldn\u2019t work together in those cases.\n\n\u201cLet me just make it very clear: Russia is not an ally of the United States. The president doesn\u2019t believe that, I don\u2019t believe that.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/93/10/00b3510a4533a5c0bd67e8ad7d1c/20191027-trump-obrien-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
