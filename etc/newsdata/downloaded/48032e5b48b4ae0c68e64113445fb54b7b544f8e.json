Bush administration, which lay down and allowed the Democrats to savage it during the fake \u201cBush lied\u201d scandal, I have a strong feeling that this president isn\u2019t going to take the attacks on his election and administration lightly.\n\nIn his 2007 book, \u201cThink Big and Kick Ass,\u201d Mr. Trump dedicated a whole chapter to the concept of revenge, stating, \u201cWhen somebody screws you, screw them back in spades. \u2026 Go for the jugular so that people watching will not want to mess with you.\u201d\n\nI predict the Trump administration will get to the bottom of all this corruption \u2014 and when the swamp is drained, many big names in this false Russian-collusion narrative will be going to jail. It will be a glorious day for American justice.\n\nAs I see it, all this deep-state corruption aimed at short-circuiting Mr. Trump\u2019s goal of making America great again is the political equivalent of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. And Mr. Trump will respond with Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto\u2019s warning that \u201ca sleeping giant\u201d has been awoken and is now \u201cfilled \u2026 with a terrible resolve.\u201d\n\nEUGENE R.
