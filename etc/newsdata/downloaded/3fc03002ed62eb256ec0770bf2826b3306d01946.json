But anyone who\u2019s been living here long enough will have realized the shocking truth: Japan is old-fashioned AF.\n\nLike an 80s movie set in an imagined future where a lot of things are packaged in plastic, Japan lives in a time warp that wants to embrace technology but is also terrified by it. Fax machines exist alongside touch-screen vending machines. Flip phones are as common as VR headsets. As for toilets. Do you choose the humble squat or the semi-sentient washlet which sings while spraying you up the butt?\n\nVery occasionally though, life here does offer us a glimpse of what the future may have in store for us.\n\nMeet Pepper, the creepy humanoid robot\n\nIf you fear super-intelligent robots, humanoid Pepper (\u30da\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc) will be the stuff of your nightmares. While this synthetic being is no Terminator, his ability to see that you are looking at him and to follow your path as you walk by, silently turning his head, is unsettling, invasive and creepy as hell.\n\nDeveloped by Softbank Robotics Aldebaran, Pepper was introduced to the market in 2014 as the first \u201crobot capable to read human emotions.\u201d Thanks to its facial and voice recognition abilities, Pepper is able to respond to the user\u2019s emotional state, using both his voice and body language to interact with people around him. At the same time, this sneaky little cyborg collects and analyzes data about you. 26\n\nAvailable for purchase at just $22,500 (a fraction of the cost of the new iPhone), Pepper has been freaking people out with its soulless black eyes at Softbank stores, public libraries, banks, medical facilities, and restaurants across the nation.\n\nNow though it looks like Pepper has decided to engage the next step of its evil plan to destroy the world.\n\nNo more birthdays for us\n\nIf one Pepper robot wasn\u2019t enough to get you to cross to the other side of the road, five of them should make you run for the hills (the really far away ones).\n\n\u306a\u3093\u304b\u3053\u306e \u4e16 \uff08 \u3088 \uff09 \u306e \u7d42 \uff08 \u304a \uff09 \u308f\u308a\u307f\u305f\u3044\u3067 \u8349 \uff08 \u304f\u3055 \uff09 = Seems like the end of the world, lol\n\nMemes and GIFs exploded on Twitter after this blood-curdling video went viral across the globe.\n\nThis is terrifying \u2014 msumisu (@msumisu) October 18, 2019\n\nYes.
