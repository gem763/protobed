The Irishman has been fighting something of a losing battle during his time in charge of the Italians. The promise of a renaissance has always been lurking just beyond the horizon, with O\u2019Shea unable to turn the perennial wooden spooners into a genuine European force.\n\nKey player\n\nMatteo Minozzi. The young full-back caught the eye at the 2018 Six Nations where he impressed with a series of dynamic attacking displays that saw him score four tries and earn a place in the team of the championship. His ability to beat a man, and proficiency in crossing the white lane, will prove invaluable for the Italians as they look to take the fight to their opponents in Japan.\n\nThe only hitch? Miozzi has been out of action since August 2018 after injuring his ACL. Last month he returned to training with Wasps, whom he signed for at the start of the year, and is set to be a part of Italy\u2019s warm-up preparations. But given the nature of his injury, it\u2019s unclear whether Minozzi will be able to hit the ground running come Sunday 22 September.\n\nPast record\n\nItaly have never progressed beyond the pool stages.\n\nPrediction\n\nSee above. 2019 won\u2019t be any different for the Azzurri.\n\nFixtures\n\nSunday 22 September \u2013 Italy v Namibia (Osaka), 6.15am\n\nThursday 26 September \u2013 Italy v Canada (Fukuoka), 8.45am\n\nFriday 4 October \u2013 South Africa v Italy (Shizuoka), 10.45am\n\nSaturday 12 October \u2013 New Zealand v Italy (Toyota), 5.45am\n\nOdds\n\nItaly to win the World Cup: 750/1", "description": "As with their yearly outings in\u00a0the\u00a0Six Nations, Italy\u00a0head to the Rugby World Cup with little expectation hanging over their heads.
