She\u2019s now two short of Vitaly Scherbo\u2019s all-time record among men or women of 23.\n\n\u201cEvery year it feels better and better just because we\u2019re adding to the legacy,\u201d Biles said. \u201cI feel like I never think of records. I just go out there and do what I came to do, which is compete for the country.\u201d\n\n#TokyoOlympics (@NBCOlympics) The floor routine of the most decorated women in world gymnastics championships history: @Simone_Biles \ud83e\udd47#Stuttgart2019 pic.twitter.com/DSNIzIjG0v\n\nThe US team scored 172.330 points to beat second-placed Russia by 5.801 points and win their seventh consecutive team title at an Olympics or world championships. According to NBC, it\u2019s the longest global title streak for a women\u2019s gymnastics program since the Soviet Union in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBiles, the prohibitive favorite in Thursday\u2019s individual all-around final, qualified for all four event finals. Additionally, she posted the best individual scores on the vault, balance beam and floor. \u201cI think if I do the routine that I did tonight I\u2019ll be more than happy\u201d on Thursday, she said.\n\nA fall for Sunisa Lee on the balance beam in her world championship debut and a fumbled routine from Grace McCallum on the uneven bars left the US with room for improvement, though both were strong on other apparatus. \u201cIt\u2019s just so surreal to come out here and end up on top with the strength of the team that we have, even after having a couple falls out there,\u201d Biles said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Simone Biles is congratulated by her USA teammates after her floor routine.

China, failing to reach the podium for the first time since 2003, were fourth after a tough day for Liu Tingting, who fell twice on the uneven bars and again on the balance beam.\n\nA fall on the beam mount by Italy\u2019s last gymnast, Elisa Iorio, made for a tense finish but she recovered to score enough to stay ahead of China by 0.536 points. It was a big recovery for Italy, who had qualified in last place for the final. \u201cThe goal for today was just to do better than qualification and how it goes, it goes,\u201d Italian gymnast Giorgia Villa said.\n\nGreat Britain finished sixth in the final, and have qualified for next year\u2019s Olympics.", "description": "The United States retained their women\u2019s team all-around title at the world gymnastics championships on Tuesday as their star re-wrote history yet again", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/biles_.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4784c76c1fe523eaaa8fe7a513def75a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
