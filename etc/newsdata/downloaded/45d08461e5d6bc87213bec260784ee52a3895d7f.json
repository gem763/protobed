Howell balked at the Justice Department\u2019s appeal to deny a House Judiciary Committee request for grand jury materials, including redacted portions of Mueller\u2019s report, ordering the department to reveal which and how many FBI witness interview reports have been turned over to the committee and how many they plan to turn over, The Washington Post reported.\n\nDURHAM INVESTIGATION INTO ORIGINS OF 2016 TRUMP CAMPAIGN SURVEILLANCE EXPANDS ITS SCOPE\n\nThe judge also said the department must explain why it was withholding interviews with witnesses who didn\u2019t go before the grand jury.\n\nHowell\u2019s ruling came after hours of testimony from lawyers for House Democrats and the Justice Department.\n\n\"This is not a situation of us getting all sorts of materials,\" a lawyer for House Democrats said. \"We're getting almost nothing.\"\n\nThe judge, appointed by former President Obama in 2010, called some of DOJ\u2019s arguments for withholding information \u201cextreme,\u201d citing the department\u2019s contention that some of the material from the Watergate grand jury should not have been turned over to Congress during the impeachment inquiry into former President Nixon.\n\n\u201cWow, OK,\u201d Howell said, according to The Post. \u201cAs I said, the department is taking extraordinary positions in this case.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department argued that a 1974 federal appeals court decision that said impeachment proceedings are exempt from grand jury secrecy rules is no longer valid because a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit this year tightened requirements to exclude impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe judge also ordered the DOJ to disclose by Friday whether the Mueller team had disclosed grand jury information when asking for help from other countries, explaining that she wanted to know if the DOJ was withholding information from Congress that had already been shared with foreign countries.\n\nRepublicans have also argued that a formal impeachment inquiry isn\u2019t taking place until the House has a vote on impeachment. Democrats deny a vote needs to take place.\n\nThe judge hasn\u2019t said when she\u2019ll make a decision on whether DOJ has to turn over the material.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe lawsuit predates the impeachment inquiry into President Trump over a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president in which he asked him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A federal judge Tuesday ordered the Justice Department to disclose some material relating grand jury information from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's\u00a0Russia investigation\u00a0into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.", "authors": ["Brie Stimson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/AP19203352203125.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
