But even in the 21st century, the lasting effects endure, both psychological and material. After all, the war took more than 60 million lives, redrew the map of Europe and ended with the Soviet Union and the United States locked in a Cold War of nuclear superpowers.\n\nJapan and South Korea should logically remain natural allies. Both are booming capitalist constitutional states. Decades ago, both nations emerged from devastating wars. And in pacifist fashion they vowed never to suffer such mass carnage again.\n\nBoth nations are staunch allies of the United States. They are likewise similarly suspicious of their neighbor, aggressive Communist China, which threatens their economies and security. Yet, Tokyo and Seoul are now more adversaries than democratic allies, and they are locked in a bitter fight. In their acrimony over trade and past war reparations, neither can forget World War II.\n\nSouth Koreans continue to press for more reparations to atone for the horrific treatment of the Korean Peninsula by Japanese occupiers and imperialists. Imperial Japan stripped Korea\u2019s natural resources and exported thousands of Korean women to war zones to be raped by Japanese troops.\n\nThe wealthier that South Korea becomes, the more an ascendant Seoul begins to rival \u2014 and worry \u2014 Tokyo. And the more distant World War II becomes, the more Japan and South Korea relive their bitter shared wartime past.\n\nThe United States has had difficulty forming a Pacific alliance of containment against a bellicose China. Australia, the Philippines and Southeast Asian nations fear Chinese aggression. But they also share bitter memories of merciless Japanese imperialism that killed as many as 15 million Chinese \u2014 the vast majority of them civilians.\n\nIn their minds, our allies know China is the chief threat. But in their hearts, even now they can\u2019t quite forget how their ally Japan once committed genocide throughout the region.\n\nNATO was designed to avoid another European war and the constant threat bullying from Germany and Russia. NATO\u2019s creed, first, was that the United States should stay engaged in Europe and never again allow it to commit collective suicide. Second, America was to keep Russia out of Western Europe as it did at the end of World War II. Third, the alliance must keep Germany \u201cdown\u201d so it would never start another European war. That third element of the original NATO mission is often laughed at as entirely irrelevant today.\n\nBut is it? Germany now dominates the European Union. Its banks squeeze Southern European countries for overdue loan payments. Berlin pressures Eastern Europe \u2014 whose leaders grew up with lectures about the nightmares of Nazi Germany \u2014 to follow Berlin\u2019s disastrous open borders plan. That laxity has resulted in more than a million migrants flocking into the EU from the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nBerlin also tried to hold the United Kingdom hostage to prevent Brexit \u2014 the verdict of the British people, a majority of whom voted to leave the EU. Less than half of today\u2019s German population has a favorable view of America, the country whose troops and nuclear umbrella still keep a virtually unarmed Germany secure.\n\nA clairvoyant in 1945 might have warned both Europe and the United States that a \u201cFourth Reich\u201d financial powerhouse would someday dominate Europe.\n\nIn addition, Germany still has an existential fear of Russia. After all, more than 3 million German soldiers perished on the Eastern Front in World War II. Millions of German-speakers were ethnically cleansed from postwar Russia and Eastern Europe by the Russian army.\n\nNo wonder that German Chancellor Angela Merkel seeks close ties with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin\u2019s autocratic Russia. As was true during the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, Germany once again has little if any ability to ward off Russian aggression, whether conventional or nuclear, and knows it.\n\nFinally, a recent poll of Americans reveals a veritable abyss between younger and older Americans. Today\u2019s millennials, children of the postwar baby boomers, grew up in the affluence of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. They claim that they will be far less likely to marry, to value religion or to feel patriotic.\n\nIn contrast, those who were once children during World War II, or who had parents and grandparents who fought in the war, have a far more realistic appraisal of human nature and the need to find security, stability and transcendence in a dangerous world.\n\nOne way of keeping sane and safe during and after such a global catastrophe was to marry and raise a family, to believe in God, and to appreciate the unique morality and strength of a victorious United States.\n\nWorld War II ended in 1945. And then again, it really did not.\n\n\u2022 Victor Davis Hanson, a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, is the author of \u201cThe Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won\u201d (Basic Books, 2017).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
