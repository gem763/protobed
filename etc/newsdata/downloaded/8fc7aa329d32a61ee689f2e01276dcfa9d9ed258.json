The Independent was unable to independently verify the claim.\n\nMervan Qamishli, a senior Kurdish official said \u201cthere was no accurate information on the names or total numbers of fugitives\u201d because of the fighting.\n\nHowever least 800 affiliates of Isis broke free form Ain Issa displaced camp, around 100km north of Mahmudly, over the weekend, which Kurdish officials said was attacked by members of the group.\n\nIt is unclear what happened the rest of the 13,000 residents of the camp which is now empty or whether other fighters have managed to break free.\n\nFrench officials have confirmed that nine French fighters managed to escape while Belgium\u2019s security assessment agency said two of their nationals had also escaped custody.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that two British Isis affiliates from east London, Tooba Gondal and Zara Iqbal, were among those who escaped but that they were intercepted by Turkish-backed Syrian troops as they tried to flee.\n\nA medical coordinator for the Kurdish Red Crescent in Ain Issa said that in total at least 50 fighters were freed in the attacks.\n\n\u201cAlmost all the guards were killed or wounded. The number of guards has been reduced in the past few days to help fight the Turkish army,\u201d Monir told The Independent.\n\n\u201cPeople here are worried and most of them have left to Raqqa itself or other cities. There has been an unprecedented wave of displacement. I live in a ghost town now,\u201d he added.\n\nIraq promised on Thursday to repatriate its nationals who are Isis fighters as well as their families in a bid to help the Kurdish authorities.\n\nAl-Hakim said foreign fighters come from 72 countries and \"their countries should take the needed measures.\"", "description": "Kurdish authorities have called for a humanitarian corridor along the frontline of the battle with Turkish forces in northern Syria, saying hundreds of civilians and teams of medics were trapped within the ferocious fighting.
