Of all the players to lose, Laporte would probably have been the last on Pep Guardiola\u2019s list and, after an afternoon when a magnificent Wolverhampton Wanderers brutally exposed City\u2019s Achilles heel thanks to two late goals from Adama Traore to hand Liverpool a significant advantage in the title race, those feelings will only have been reinforced.\n\nAfter just eight games, Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side have an eight point lead, the biggest any team has enjoyed in the Premier League era at this stage. City clawed back a seven point deficit last term to win the title but this will be a different challenge.\n\nThey may have been without Kevin De Bruyne for long periods then but they still had Laporte anchoring the back line and, for as long as he is missing and Nicolas Otamendi is manning the defence, City will be vulnerable.\n\nPerhaps the loss of Laporte with a knee injury until March would not have proved quite as costly had City been willing to cough up an additional \u00a320 million to sign Harry Maguire but they opted against doing so and the wisdom of that now looks questionable. John Stones\u2019s return from injury after the international break cannot come soon enough, although the England centre-half has been having his own struggles.", "description": "Manchester City have coped incredibly well with the loss of big players to injury in recent seasons but the long term absence of Aymeric Laporte may prove a bridge too far even for this side.", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Northern Football Correspondent", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212212620-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
