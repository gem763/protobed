But Johnson instead attempted to shut down Parliament from the start of September \u2014 a decision that on Wednesday was ruled unlawful\u2014 meaning MPs did not have a chance to vote on the usual recess schedule.", "description": "MPs denied Johnson's request for a parliamentary recess so the Conservative Party's annual conference in Manchester could go ahead as planned.", "authors": ["Adam Bienkov", "Thomas Colson", "Adam Payne"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cb3f12e22af552925e541-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
