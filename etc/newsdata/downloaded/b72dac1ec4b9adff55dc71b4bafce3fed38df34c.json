(AP) - Jeff Undercuffler threw four touchdown passes and Albany rallied in the second half to beat Rhode Island 35-28 on Saturday.\n\nUndercuffler had 140 yards passing for the Great Danes (5-3, 3-1 Colonial Athletic Association). Karl Mofor ran for 101 yards on 19 carries.\n\nAlbany trailed 14-6 at halftime but defensive end Eli Mencer sacked Rhode Island\u2019s Vito Priore on the opening drive of the second half, forcing a fumble which was picked up by lineman Nick Griffin who returned it 55 yards for a Great Danes touchdown. Rhode Island fumbled the ensuing kickoff return and cornerback Alex Badine recovered, setting up a 13-yard Undercuffler TD pass to LJ Wesneski four plays later for a 21-14 lead with 10:39 left in the third.\n\nTurnovers plagued Rhode Island the rest of the game and Albany capitalized on a Priore interception with another scoring pass from Undercuffler to Wesneski, giving the Great Danes the lead for good, 28-21, with 1:09 remaining in the third.\n\nPriore threw for 320 yards and two scores for the Rams (1-6, 0-4).\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jeff Undercuffler threw four touchdown passes and Albany rallied in the second half to beat Rhode Island 35-28 on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
