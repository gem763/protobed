AAP Image/Jason O'Brien/via REUTERS\n\nBlazes in New South Wales (NSW) state have ravaged more than 80,000 hectares (198,000 acres) of land this week alone, and state fire service officials said they were monitoring about 25 fires ahead of what\u2019s shaping up to be a long bushfire season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned ... this is going to be a horrible bushfire season,\u201d state premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.\n\nMost of the homes were lost in the northern towns of Busbys Flat, Rappville and Casino, part of a major agricultural area.\n\nLarge areas of eastern Australia are experiencing severe drought. Several rural centres could run out of drinking water next year unless rains come.\n\nAustralia\u2019s air temperature has warmed over the past century, according to a state of the climate report in January, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events like drought and fires.\n\nRob Rogers, NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner, said fire crews from other states were coming to help so firefighters did not get worn out so early in the season.\n\n\u201cIn light of how long some of those crews have been going, we\u2019ve called for interstate support,\u201d he said.\n\nFire services are also monitoring blazes in the state of Queensland, while high-risk fire alerts have been issued in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts are with those who have lost a great deal, fortunately there\u2019s been no loss of life,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nFires have been raging in Australia for several weeks, despite it only being mid-spring. Usually, fires are more severe in summer.\n\nQueensland vineyard owner Robert Davidson was at home in early September when a damaged powerline set his plum orchard ablaze before flames tore through four blocks of vineyards reserved for a fledgling wine brand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bone dry. It\u2019s like a ticking time-bomb out there. Normally we\u2019d be doing controlled burns and now we\u2019re burning for all the wrong reasons,\u201d he told Reuters.", "description": "More than 20 homes have been destroyed by spring fires in Australia, officials said on Wednesday, straining communities already suffering under the region's worst drought conditions in living memory.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438719505&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980AE", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
