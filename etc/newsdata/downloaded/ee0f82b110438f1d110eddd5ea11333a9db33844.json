And no matter what you buy, its details will be well-thought-out and beautiful. But anyone who\u2019s shopped there knows that it\u2019s not the cheapest place to shop, which is why real Anthro fans tend to wait for things to go on sale before adding them to their to carts. Today is one of those add-to-cart days because Anthropologie is taking 25 percent off everything on its site (plus offering free shipping) \u2014 and, yes, you heard us correctly: everything.
