'I don't think we're prepared for the results. We're not.'\n\nGreen isn't the first person to speculate that humanity isn't equipped to handle an encounter with life from another planet.\n\nIn 1953, the CIA recommended the creation of The Robertson Panel, after an investigation of various UFO cases led it to worry the public focus on alien life might lead to 'hysterical mass behavior.'\n\nThe Interplanetary Initiative at Arizona State University has taken up the mantle of preparing for the moment when humans first encounter life, part of its larger mission of advocating to make space habitable for humans.\n\nEngineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California work on the rover, which will drill into Mars's surface in search of evidence of extra-terrestrial life\n\nMARS 2020 ROVER 101 Set launch on July 31, 2020 Mission will last 687 Earth days 10 feet long, 9 feet wide, 7 feet tall Weighs 2,314 pounds Equipped with 6.6-foot drill Will carry microchip containing more than 10 million humans\n\nLast year, Michael E.W. Varnum of ASU, was among a group of researchers who published a study examining how humans might actually react to the news of life on other planets.\n\nThe researchers solicited 501 brief essays expressing the author's personal feelings about learning there was proof of extra-terrestrial life.\n\nFollowing a close linguistic analysis of the sample, Varnum et al found that people were actually much more likely to be optimistic about the news than fearful.\n\nThere'll be plenty of time to think more about the question as the Mars 2020 Rover won't land on the red planet until January 31, 2021.", "description": "The Mars 2020 Rover will take humanity one step closer to answering whether there is life on the red planet.
