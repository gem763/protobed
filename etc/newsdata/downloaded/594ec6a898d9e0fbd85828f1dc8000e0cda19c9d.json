There, in a corner of the club, he set up a ping-pong robot, one that can have balls shot out from between two spinning disks, for as long as required.\n\nFor sixteen hours between 7am and 11pm that day, the robot's performance was put to test by Navin Kumar, who had been training with Hodges for a few years. Kumar, who had congenital heart condition, was diagnosed with Young Onset Parkinson's Disease (YOPD) three years earlier.\n\n\"I battled the robot for sixteen hours straight in order to raise $1600 that would allow me to travel with Team USA and compete at the Para Open in Cluj, Romania later that year,\" recalled the 46-year-old. \"Throughout I didn't stop to eat: I held the table tennis paddle in one hand and ate my sandwich with my other hand.\"\n\n\"I thankfully only needed to urinate that day. The bathroom was 20 feet from the table tennis table, so I gave myself a 60 second bathroom break,\" he continued.\n\nIt was a test of some sort for Hodges too. \"While Navin got down to his challenge, I had a lot of writing done \u2013 eleven articles in total \u2013 on a nearby table that had been barriered off together with his one,\" he said. \"All day and night, it was just a steady smack\u2026smack\u2026smack, about one per second, on and On and ON!\"\n\nMore than four hundred dollars was raised on that day, and Kumar eventually went to Romania, where, partnering with another ping pong player from Israel, he defeated the duo representing Japan and Russia, thus winning his first-ever Para doubles match. (The year before, Kumar had been to Spain for the Para Open held in Barcelona.)\n\n\"I am the first athlete in history to actively complete with Parkinson's on the Olympic and Paralympic level,\" said Kumar, whose diagnosis of the disease in 2013 was described by him as being \"not that upsetting\".\n\n\"I've had heart issues my entire life and have never known a 'normal life',' he said. \"The Parkinson's was just another medical challenge to make me stronger.\"\n\nIn 1973, Kuma was born in Arizona of parents who hailed from India. The next year, the family moved to Utah, where the father, whom Kuma described as his \"greatest inspiration\", worked as a government engineer.\n\nBefore turning four, Kuma had already undergone two open-heart surgeries, carried out within two weeks' time. The third would come he was eight, followed by a forth one at 19 and a fifth one at 27.\n\n\"The first time I realized that I was somehow different was at the kindergarten. I saw I couldn't run as far as the rest of the class. As a young child, it scared me,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the heart condition was banning him from participating in all physical activities, all but one. \"We had a table tennis table in the garage of our house. My father was a table tennis champion back in India and, with doctor's approval, he began teaching me how to play\u2026 And I played on and off throughout my childhood.\"\n\nOne of Kumar's memorable moments came when the teenager captained his high-school table tennis team and wound up coming in the second place in the country. Another took place in the summer of 2010, when Kumar won gold in the doubles while on the Bermuda cruise with his family. \"That was the major turning point for me to get back to the game. I started taking lessons with Hodges and others at the Maryland Table Tennis Center,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the two men had met before. \"We first met at a regional college sports championships, where we both represented University of Maryland, me in table tennis, him in pool,\" said Hodges, \"Navin has always been very good at focusing on an activity.\n\nOver the past few years, as Parkinson's strike, Hodges, along with a number of other coaches that Kumar has been training with at various points in time, have been witnesses to Kumar's almost stubborn effort \"to defy odds to be where I am today\", to use the latter's own words.\n\n\"At first it was very difficult: my right hand would shake uncontrollably, which rendered my forehand and backhand shots very weak,\" he said. \"Two long-time friends of mine \u2013 Donn Olsen and Kyongsook Kim, helped me to start back from the beginning and focus on my forehand play with inverted rubber bat, and backhand play with long pips rubber bat.\"\n\n\"They also helped me improve the transition from the forehand to the backhand \u2013 something basic to an average ping pong player but not me,\" he continued. \"The significant Parkinson's tremor that I have in my dominant right hand, plus the muscle stiffness and slow movement, means that I have to quickly teach my right hand how to play each time I play table tennis.\"\n\n\"Brick-wall defense style\" is Hodge's answer to Kumar's problems. \"This allows him to conserve energy a bit more than a more aggressive style. A player of this style uses a specialized covering on the backhand side of his racket \u2013 the long pips \u2013 to return the opponent's topspin attack with steady, off-the-bounce backspin returns, covering most of the table with his hand,\" said Hodges. \"This way, he either pins the opponent to his backhand side, or moves him side to side.\"\n\nWith all that being said, the coach has observed remarkable improvement since Kumar made a more serious commitment to ping pong playing, shortly after his diagnosis of Parkinson's.\n\n\"Now he's getting better and better at suddenly smashing with the forehand, or flipping his racket to make another sudden smash with his backhand,\" he said.\n\nThis has been reaffirmed by Kumar's doctor, who recently reported a 94% improvement in his motor skills since 2013.\n\nYet for Kumar, nothing is more miraculous than the fact that these days, once he starts playing, his hand stops shaking. \"I can really say why this happens, but that is just what happens. Maybe because the brain is too preoccupied with table tennis, it doesn't have time for the Parkinson's thing that has caused my hands to shake,\" he said in a YouTube video that also shows him playing unaffected. \"That's the beauty of the sport.\"\n\nIn December 2018, Kumar won two bronzes at the US Open, one in the Para event class, the other in a hardbat ratings event. Proud as he was, winning was never on the top of his agenda.\n\n\"We are all winner because we are all in good enough health to play this sport which has the ability to improve our health,\" he said.\n\nIn July this year, Kumar underwent a heart surgical procedure called \"ablation\", for the correction of atrial fibrillation. As a result, he took a break, before resuming training for the inaugural World Parkinson's Table Tennis Championships held in Pleasantville, New York in mid-October, where he bagged a bronze for Men's Singles and silver for Men's Doubles.\n\n\"Navin has the ability to find the positive in anything, so I haven't really seen any change of mood in the past. However, he likely has them but doesn't give in to them,\" said Hodges. \"I know about his struggles here.\"\n\nPositivity is infectious. And Kumar, who has been invited to speak to various people including patients, caregivers, doctors and corporate employees, is never reluctant to pass on his ample share. \"The people I inspire wind up equally inspiring me as each individual story has helped me see and appreciate what others have gone through,\" he said.\n\nThese days, Kumar's two daughters \u2013 aged 9 and 14 \u2013 have also tried their hands with the bouncing ball. \"Both of them are left-handed and right-handed so they can play table tennis with both hands naturally,\" he said.\n\nFor the past two open-heart surgeries that Kumar had to address his congenital defects \u2013 at the age of 19 and 27, mechanical implants were installed in his heart along with a cardiac pacemaker.\n\nA few years ago, a paddle-maker friend from Texas made two table tennis paddles for Kumar free-of-charge. \"One is sponge and the other hardbat, branded with my name with inlaid carbon fiber on the handle on one of the paddles,\" he said. Carbon fiber is the material of which Kumar's heart implants are made. (The man has also cultivated the hobby of car customizing. He sees the car, which he made stronger and faster by using a supercharger and carbon fiber for weight savings, an extension of himself as well as a metaphor for his own life story.)\n\n\"Growing up, I was a huge fan of the Six Million Dollar Man,\" said Kumar, referring to the hit American science fiction in which the title role, a former astronaut, has superhuman strength due to his bionic implants. \"I had wished to be him as a kid and now my wish has been granted.\"\n\n\"I've got the mechanical part and the electronic part. The only thing that's lacking is the cool Bionic sounds,\" he said. \"But hey, I can live with that!\"", "description": "On an average Saturday in March 2016, coach Larry Hodges arrived at 6:30 am at the Maryland Table Tennis Club, nearly three hours earlier than he usually would.
