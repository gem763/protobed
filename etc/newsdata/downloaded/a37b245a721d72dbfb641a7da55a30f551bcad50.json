Pet Sitting Services.\n\nMorrison ran the company for 18 years, and built up a crew of 35 employees before selling it in 2013. At the time of her company\u2019s sale, she generated millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nShe declined to disclose the amount she received for Woof! Pet Sitting.\n\nHowever, building it up from scratch wasn\u2019t easy, Morrison explained to Yahoo Finance recently \u2014 and therein lies a lesson for other would-be entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning it was very slow. I did not know how to market, I didn\u2019t know how to run a business,\u201d she told YFi PM.\n\n\u201cI got books out of the library and I started studying, enrolled myself in my own business school at night,\u201d Morrison added.\n\nAnd it took years for her income to break the $100,000 barrier, which it did in 2000, and continued to rise for most of the following years.\n\nSocial Media Takeover\n\nLow section of woman walking with English bulldog on sidewalk More\n\nMorrison says that when she started, her options for advertising were not as readily accessible as they are now. \u201cI really utilized SEO, search engine optimization. So my website came up very high on the search engine,\u201d she told Yahoo Finance.\n\nPart of her initial struggle was proving that dog walking was a business. \u201cWhen I started, people didn\u2019t really know what dog walking was,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nFast forward to 2019, and its become a bonafide market in its own right. The American Pet Products Association estimates that owners will spend over $75 billion on their pets this year in the United States.\n\nAs Woof! made money, Morrison said she was able to whittle her work days down to just three per week during her last decade running the business. She now runs Six-Figure Pet Business Academy, a business focused on coaching dog walking professionals.\n\nYahoo Finance's All Markets Summit, Oct. 10 More\n\nMorrison added that things would have been easier for her if social media had been as ubiquitous as it is today.\n\n\u201cI absolutely would be using social media now. It\u2019s so important. I mean, that is the way that people are finding out about different services,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not using it as a business owner, you\u2019re going to be left behind,\u201d she added.\n\nMcKenzie DeGroot is a producer at Yahoo Finance.
