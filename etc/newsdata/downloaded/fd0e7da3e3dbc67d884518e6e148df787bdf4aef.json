Ireland, Jean-Claude Juncker, and others say it won't work. Breakthrough? Where?\n\nIgnore the denials, Boris Johnson made significant progress in negotiations with the EU and Ireland. Here are a few details of Johsnon's proposal from the Guardian Live Blog. Johnson\u2019s plan essentially replaces a UK-wide backstop with a Northern Ireland (NI) only backstop (which is what was originally planned before May proposed the UK-wide one to satisfy the DUP). Under May\u2019s plan the whole of the UK would have stayed in the customs union, and NI would also have stayed bound by some single market (regulatory) rules. Johnson has reverted to a NI-only model, with two features: Northern Ireland staying in an all-island regulatory zone for goods, meaning a regulatory border down the Irish Sea; but Northern Ireland staying in UK customs territory, meaning a customs border in Ireland. Frosty Reception The Guardian says Johnson's plan received a frosty reception. And Ireland's Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar says Johnsosn plans 'do not fully meet agreed objectives'. Breakthrough? Yes Not only is Varadkar ready for more talks, so is Juncker. Juncker Open to Discuss Here is a snip from Juncker's Statement. President Juncker welcomed Prime Minister Johnson's determination to advance the talks ahead of the October European Council and make progress towards a deal. He acknowledged the positive advances, notably with regards to the full regulatory alignment for all goods and the control of goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, the President also noted that there are still some problematic points that will need further work in the coming days, notably with regards to the governance of the backstop. The delicate balance struck by the Good Friday Agreement must be preserved. Another concern that needs to be addressed are the substantive customs rules. He also stressed that we must have a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop: preventing a hard border, preserving North-South cooperation and the all-island economy, and protecting the EU's Single Market and Ireland's place in it. No Deal Scam Some label the effort as a \"no deal scam.\" There is nothing fair or reasonable in this plan. It is a No Deal Scam. It is a Trojan Horse which will jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement and also undermine the future prosperity of the United Kingdom. https://t.co/hr8qPiDUUK \u2014 Mike Gapes (@MikeGapes) October 2, 2019\n\nBut ...\n\nDUP on Board\n\nThis is a sensible way forward. It allows the people of Northern Ireland consent in a way not provided by the anti-democratic backstop. We hope that people will look at it in a serious way.https://t.co/R2EMusDWsF pic.twitter.com/AnJ17Qdic0 \u2014 Arlene Foster (@DUPleader) October 2, 2019\n\nSolid majority?\n\n\u201cA pretty solid majority\u201d in the Commons for the new Brexit deal, says Michael Gove to @Peston, ITV, 2245 tonight pic.twitter.com/F6huAvT5ug \u2014 John Rentoul (@JohnRentoul) October 2, 2019\n\nKey Idea\n\nBREAKING from Dublin after PM call with Varadkar\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Taoiseach said the proposals do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, he indicated that he would study them in further detail, and would consult with the EU institutions\u201d \u2014 Nick Eardley (@nickeardleybbc) October 2, 2019\n\nLabour Support\n\nGareth Snell and Ruth Smeeth have just told me they will vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s #brexit deal if it is approved by the EU.

Will MPs try to block short prorogation at end of next week? And when vote of government\u2019s programme comes on 21 or 22 October, and when government is defeated, how at that point could Boris Johnson continue in office? Murky \u2014 Robert Peston (@Peston) October 2, 2019\n\nJohnson intends to request that the current session of Parliament be prorogued from the evening of Tuesday 8 October, with a Queen\u2019s Speech on Monday 14 October.\n\nAll that court action for what?\n\nIt looks to me like it helped Johnson.\n\nLabour Bounce is Over\n\nDespite an allegedly amazing speech by Jeremy Corbyn at the Labour Party conference, the Labour bounce lasted all of one day, assuming it happened at all.\n\nBenn Bill\n\nThe Benn Bill says Johnson must ask for an extension. Johnson says he won't. He also says he will comply with the law.\n\nThe bill proponents say the bill is watertight. Can both sides be correct?\n\nPossibly. One way would be if Johnson can get the EU to say this is the final deal, and there will be no more extensions.\n\nThe irony in this madness is that far from taking No Deal off the table, the Benn bill increased the odds of No Deal.\n\nLabour's position is to negotiate a deal and then hold a referendum. That can't possibly sit well with the EU.\n\nEveryone is tired of referendums, except it seems for Labour.\n\nCorbyn Caretaker Government Unlikely\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have repeatedly ruled out supporting Jeremy Corbyn as leader of a caretaker government. Without their support Corbyn does not have the votes to head up a caretaker government.\n\nAnd Corbyn refuses to back anyone else. Without Labour votes there is again no majority.\n\nThis is crucial. Parliament can oust Johnson, but if it cannot agree on a new PM to seek an extension, there will not be an extension if Johnson has a way around Benn or if the EU refuses to extend.\n\nGrounds for a Deal\n\nIf there are elections, Johnson rates to get a huge majority. In that case, No Deal happens, extension or not. The EU can see the polls too. They are very aware of them. Germany is in shambles. The entire Eurozone is on the cusp of recession if not in recession. And to top it off, Trump just won a case against Airbus and will now go ahead with tariffs. The EU will not breach certain red lines but neither will Johnson. The makings of a fair deal are right there in those five points.\n\n\n\nPolitical Reality The UK and the EU took small steps towards each other. This is the first time in three years that has happened.\n\nDon't underestimate or overestimate what that means. There are dozens of ways a deal can collapse, but as long as the Liberal Democrats hold their ground, odds favor a deal or an election rather than another delay or extension or a long-duration caretaker government.\n\nIgnore the chatter. The Liberal Democrat's primary goal is not really to win Brexit cancellation, but to pick up a huge number of Labour seats.\n\nIf it negotiations collapse, the most likely result given election math is a Johnson victory and No Deal at all.\n\nFinally, the Liberal Democrats have a current hold on all the hard Remainers. Like Johnson, they want elections. The kicker is that the Liberal Democrats want an election before Brexit is settled. Remain goes away as an issue in the event of a deal.\n\nPonder that last point. The Liberal Democrats are desperate for an election but it has to be before Brexit is settled. To get one, they need to defeat a Johnson deal or somehow trigger an election before this is settled.\n\nIf the Liberal Democrats can do the latter, prepare for a Labour slaughter and a No Deal Brexit.\n\nThere is no advantage for the Liberal Democrats to support a caretaker government under Corbyn or any caretaker government at all that does not force elections by January.\n\nThis diminishes the odds but does not entirely rule out a lengthy caretaker government with Brexit suspended.", "description": "Johnson submitted his plan to the EU.
