France start fast\n\nFrance could not afford to get dragged into an attritional, forward-based contest. They have neither the big match steel nor grunt in the pack to grind out a victory against a Welsh side designed to do exactly that. What they had to do was invite the Welsh to play their game, broken-field, transition rugby and ask them to expand their repertoire.\n\nTo do that, they needed a fast start, and got one. Hitting width and with great appetite to play, they began with pace in space, utilising their dangerous midfield carriers Gael Fickou and Virimi Vakatawa early to break the line and get beyond the Welsh defence. Vakatawa might have been over had Damian Penaud been able to slip his offload into the former sevens star\u2019s hands, but soon after Sebastien Vahaamahina managed to burrow his way through after a powerful driving maul went close.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Getty Images 2/31 <b>Wales:</b> Liam Williams - 6 France did an excellent job of kicking away from him to limit his involvement, with few chances to show what he can do. Getty Images 3/31 George North - 6 Excellent tackle stopped Fickou early on, but was intercepted by Huget when Wales had a three-man overlap as they were desperately searching for the try. Didn\u2019t have a great game by all accounts, but then not many in red did. AFP via Getty Images 4/31 Owen Watkin - 5 Had big shoes to fill in Jonathan Davies\u2019s last-minute absence, but didn\u2019t show his best and showed what Wales lose without Davies in the side. Getty Images 5/31 Hadleigh Parkes - 5 Made no impact whatsoever with ball in hand and the fact that he was thumped backwards by Huget sums up the Welsh performance. Getty Images 6/31 Josh Adams - 6 Tried to come off his wing in an effort to get involved in the game but could not find anything come his way as he was starved of ball. World Rugby via Getty Images 7/31 Dan Biggar - 6 100 per cent record from the tee and his kicking from hand was average, if not good, but will need to work out how to get his back line firing again. At least he showed o signs of the recent concussions he\u2019s suffered. AFP via Getty Images 8/31 Gareth Davies - 5 Didn\u2019t look his normal lively self as France contained him around the fringe, and he made no impact off the defensive line in attempting his trademark interceptions. REUTERS 9/31 Wyn Jones - 5 Quiet in attack, quiet in defence, Just quiet, really. AP 10/31 Ken Owens - 6 Wales\u2019s most prominent defender as he led the tackling charts. Breathed a huge sigh of relief when his intercepted 25-metre pass was ruled inconsequential due to a knock-on advantage, as Guirado galloped over for what he thought was France\u2019s fourth try. REUTERS 11/31 Tomas Francis - 5 Conceded a penalty early on and struggled in the scrum, though contributed well in defence. REUTERS 12/31 Jake Ball - 6 Made one impactful tackle that sent the French into reverse, but his place is coming under threat from the returning Adam Beard. AFP via Getty Images 13/31 Alun Wyn Jones - 6 Got little change out of the French defence with the ball in hand, but his defensive effort was at the highest degree that we\u2019ve come to expect. REUTERS 14/31 Aaron Wainwright - 7 Sprung into life to snap up the loose ball and gallop away for his try that kicked Wales into life with a much-needed score to stem the flow. Was on the receiving end of Vahaamahina\u2019s disgraceful elbow in the second half, but on the whole it was another good showing from the youngster. AFP via Getty Images 15/31 Justin Tipuric - 6 Played a key role in the match-winning try by catching the rip and taking it to the line. Spent a lot of time out wide, which didn\u2019t always help his side. Getty Images 16/31 Josh Navidi - 5 Suffered a hamstring injury in the first half that forced him off. Replacement Ross Moriarty joined him minutes later when he was sent to the sin-bin, though he redeemed himself with the match-winning try. Getty Images 17/31 <b>France:</b> Maxime Medard - 7 Kicked smartly until his rash decision to attempt a drop-goal from halfway saw him grubber the ball instead. Part of a French back line that dazzled throughout the first half as he caused Wales all sorts of problems with his offloading in the tackle. AFP via Getty Images 18/31 Damian Penaud - 7 On another day he could have scored a hat-trick, but he did set up a beauty for Vakatawa as he split Biggar and Owens before offloading to the centre. He was guilty of dropping one with the line in front of him in the second half. AFP via Getty Images 19/31 Virimi Vakatawa - 8 Possibly his best performance in a France shirt. He caused all sorts of problems for the Welsh defence, scoring a try himself and knocking Biggar into next week with one emphatic charge. AFP via Getty Images 20/31 Gael Fickou - 8 Made a superb start to the match as he ran riot with Ntamack, cutting through the gaps left in the Welsh line. Could have scored early on had it now been for North\u2019s excellent tackle. EPA 21/31 Yoann Huget - 6 Made a thumping tackle on Parkes and intercepted North crucially when Wales had a three-man overlap, but otherwise he was strangely quiet. AFP via Getty Images 22/31 Romain Ntamack - 8 Ran the show throughout the first half with a stunning display of running rugby. Brought his outside backs into play beautifully that Wales simply could not contend with. Played a key role in Ollivon\u2019s try that will go down as one of the best at the tournament. AFP via Getty Images 23/31 Antoine Dupont - 7 Mixed up his play well with a blend of runs and kicks. Was on hand to take an offload from Ntamack and feed Ollivon to score the second try. AFP via Getty Images 24/31 Jefferson Poirot - 7 Won a penalty against Francis early on and made a strong contribution defensively. You could visibly see the role he\u2019s taken on within this team as he tried to lead the pack. PA 25/31 Guilhem Guirado - 6 Lost possession of the ball in contact with Ball that lead to Wainwright\u2019s breakaway try. Reliable in the lineout but disappointed slightly with his carrying. Decision to replace him straight after the red card was a puzzling one. AFP via Getty Images 26/31 Rabah Slimani - 7 Stood strong in the scrum, but needed to do more with the ball and missed two tackles. Getty Images 27/31 Bernard le Roux - 6 In the unfamiliar position of lock that stemmed his talents around the ruck. REUTERS 28/31 Sebastien Vahaamahina - 3 Got the ball rolling with the opening try of the game, only to go from hero to villain with a stupid deliberate elbow to the head of Wainwright that earned him a straight red card and swung the game in Wales\u2019s favour. AFP via Getty Images 29/31 Wenceslas Lauret - 6 Ran good support lines on occasion but could have done more defensively when the going got tough. AFP via Getty Images 30/31 Charles Ollivon - 7 On the shoulder of Dupont to inherit the ball and finish from range for the second try, and nearly found himself with another chance soon after in chasing a loose ball. A good showing. AFP via Getty Images 31/31 Gregory Alldritt - 7 Stood out with Ollivon in the back-row as he made important runs for his side.

AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe story of Virimi Vakatawa is strange, sad and special. Born in New Zealand and raised in Fiji, he was brought to France by great Fijian wing Sireli Bobo, qualifying for his adopted nation in 2013 and immediately being brought into the French sevens circuit.\n\nWith flamenco footwork, pace, power and an offloading game to rival the world\u2019s best, Vakatawa was one of the true stars of the sevens circuit, and parachuted in to the French national team set-up ahead of the 2016 Six Nations, and immediately given a prominent role as a roaming wing on a combined contract with the sevens set-up.\n\nBut Vakatawa was far from a finished product, and struggled to provide impact in a team that had serious problems inside him. Jacques Brunel\u2019s installation as head coach rather saw Vakatawa cast aside, and, in many ways, forgotten about as other wings were injected and quickly discared.\n\nVakatawa went away and reinvented himself as a centre in a Racing 92 shirt, playing in a side that suited him to a T, with commitment to fast, offloading, open rugby. 18 months ago his mother died shortly after Vakatawa promised to win back his place in the French side \u2013 at her funeral, he laid a France jersey on her coffin. Sure enough, courtesy of a fine season alongside Finn Russell and co on the outskirts of Paris and an untimely injury to Geoffrey Doumayrou, Vakatawa kept his promise.\n\nWith Brunel jettisoning Mathieu Bastareaud out of the team to seek greater potency and flair in that 13 berth, Vakatawa got his chance, and took it, dovetailing beautifully with the similarly effervescent Gael Fickou in midfield. He is the perfect outside centre for a team now committed to that open style, and this was a game that showed that.\n\nVakatawa was integral to the first two tries, making the half-break that set up the fabulous second score, and then scored the third as France took a nine point advantage into half-time.\n\n3.Wales show their fight to stay in it\n\nWales may have been down by nine points at half-time, but they backed themselves. That is partly due to the Six Nations meeting between the pair earlier in the year \u2013 it was a sixteen point half-time lead on that occasion, and Wales overturned it to begin their run to the Grand Slam.\n\nHere, Aaron Wainwright\u2019s opportunistic score kept them alive, and Dan Biggar\u2019s boot allowed them to stay within striking distance.\n\nFrance simply do not have the final quarter fitness and clarity of thought that Wales do, partly due to the fact that their domestic league does not demand the same levels of fitness of the other big leagues. There, stars are often able to take games off, rotated out, or play fewer minutes, and games tend to devolve into attritional affairs at the death. France consistently under-perform in the second half and final 20, not managing to add even a point to their half-time total here, and they tend to make silly errors, too\u2026\n\n4. Sebastien Vahaamahina costs France\u2026again!\n\nRecall that come-from-behind Welsh victory, and you might just remember a scrum-capped second row trying to hurl a 30-yard pass over the head of George North. It did not work: North intercepted, juggled, and raced away to score the match-winning try.\n\nHere, Sebastien Vahaamahina cost his side again. This was an ever greater act of stupidity, tussling with Aaron Wainwright in a maul and then, for reasons known only to the giant second row, decided to throw his elbow into the face of the Welsh back-rower.\n\nIt was not a tough decision for the officiating team \u2013 red cards seldom come more clear. France were down to 14 men, and an ideal opportunity to progress to the semi-final slipped through their grasp.\n\n5. Wales strike at the death\n\nFair play to France. Few sides would have been able to hold on for the length of time they did with 14. Showing unusual organisation and desperation in defence, it seemed for a while like they might just manage to hold out for a famous World Cup victory.\n\nBut they could not. Ross Moriarty wriggled his way over after the ball was ripped free from French hands at the back of a retreating French scrum, and Wales had the try, and the win. South Africa or Japan await, and while Wales will have to be much better, they have every chance of reaching a World Cup final for the first time.", "description": "1.
