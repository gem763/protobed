Of the total 406 recorded deaths between 1 December 2018 and 1 September 2019, 339 \u2013 more than 80% \u2013 were among children.\n\nThe main causes of death were severe malnutrition, diarrhoea and pneumonia.\n\nThe camp, near the border with Iraq, is known among its female residents as Jabal Baghuz, or Baghuz Mountain, named after the oasis town on the Euphrates river where their husbands were finally defeated in March.\n\nThe majority of the 70,000 people living in the al-Hawl camp are women and children. The IRC said that roughly 34% of all child deaths recorded up until mid-July occurred in tents, meaning that the victims had not been transferred to a health facility.\n\n\u201cThe main causes [of death] being recorded are severe malnutrition with complications, diarrhoea with dehydration and pneumonia \u2013 a proxy indicator of poor health conditions upon arrival and poor access to humanitarian assistance,\u201d the IRC said.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for 7,000 children of foreign nationals who are sheltered in the camp\u2019s annex, where the highest number of under-five deaths have been recorded.\n\nThe IRC said health services have recently improved in the camp except in the annex, where residents have access to few services and face restrictions to their movement. Pregnant women, for example, are \u201ccompelled to give birth alone in their tents\u201d, the agency said.\n\nAccording to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) situation report, the foreigner\u2019s annex is \u201cstill suffering from the lack for full provision of health services\u201d.\n\nMisty Buswell, IRC\u2019s Middle East policy, advocacy and communications director, urged repatriation of foreign children and said more support was needed for resources to treat children in the camp for trauma and distress.\n\nInside al-Hawl camp, the incubator for Islamic State's resurgence Read more\n\n\u201cThe fates of the 70,000 people in al-Hawl who lived an appalling existence under Isis are uncertain. Foreigners face even more uncertainty, as few countries are willing to repatriate their citizens \u2013 threatening to create a generation of stateless children with no prospects or hope for a future,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAll those in [al-Hawl] camp are entitled to humanitarian assistance without discrimination and life-saving services need to be urgently scaled up, particularly for foreign nationals in the camp.\u201d\n\nBuswell added: \u201cThe tragic increase in child deaths underscores the need for countries of origin to repatriate these children and ensure that they don\u2019t become stateless, and for the international community to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety and wellbeing of these innocent victims of the conflict. This will include the provision of education and psychosocial support conducive to rehabilitation and recovery necessary for peaceful and productive futures.\u201d", "description": "Aid agency calls for urgent upscaling of inadequate healthcare at refuge housing women and children displaced by fall of Isis", "authors": ["Saeed Kamali Dehghan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1437bac99bca7063868709e2c97e6b37f66349d6/21_32_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e751ddfabc339b91ae6618cf750e992c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
