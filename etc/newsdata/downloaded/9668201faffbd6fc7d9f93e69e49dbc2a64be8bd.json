Mr Mahaffy added: 'SAM's data is extremely complex and takes time to interpret. But we're all eager to see what we can learn from this new location, Glen Etive.'\n\nAbout 984 feet (300 meters) behind the rover is Vera Rubin Ridge, which Curiosity departed nearly a year ago.\n\nScientists hope the remains of bacterial life may have been preserved for billions of years within the rock samples\n\nBeyond the ridge, you can see the floor of Gale Crater and the crater's northern rim. Curiosity has been ascending Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain inside the crater.\n\nClay-based rocks are good at preserving chemical compounds, which break down over time when bombarded by radiation from space and the Sun.\n\nThe science team is intrigued to see which organic compounds, if any, have been preserved in the rocks at Glen Etive.\n\nUnderstanding how this area formed will give them a better idea of how the Martian climate was changing billions of years ago.", "description": "NASA scientists hope the remains of bacterial life may have been preserved for billions of years within the Martian rock samples.", "authors": ["Sophie Curtis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/11/20175616-0-image-a-5_1571999779616.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
