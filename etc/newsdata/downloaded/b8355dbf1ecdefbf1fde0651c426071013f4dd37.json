Police said they believe the body belongs to the woman pictured on the SD card. They are currently waiting on the medical examiner to identify the woman and confirm the cause of death.\n\nFollowing an investigation, police arrested and charged 48-year-old South African native Brian Steven Smith with first-degree murder on Oct. 8.\n\nPolice spokesman MJ Thim told Alaska Public Media that investigators had to determine whether the images and video on the SD card were authentic.\n\n\u201cWith the SD card, one of the first questions that detectives had to answer was, \u2018Was this staged or did this really happen?\u2019\u201d Thim said. \u201cWhen they were able to determine that this was an actual crime, then the investigation started to quickly speed up.\u201d\n\nSmith was taken into custody at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport on Tuesday afternoon and is currently being held on a $750,000 cash bond.\n\nAccording to charging documents obtained by TIME, the SD card, which was labeled \u201chomicide at midtown Marriott,\u201d contained 39 photos and 12 videos that depicted a naked woman \u2014 who police believe to be Native Alaskan \u2014 being assaulted and strangled in a hotel room.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Justice, 56% of American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced physical violence by intimate partners in their lifetime. (Police have not confirmed any details relating to the relationship between Smith and his alleged victim.)\n\nIn the videos, the man police believe to be Smith is heard laughing and saying \u201cjust die\u201d as he strangles the woman. She attempts to fight back by scratching at his wrist, the charging documents said.\n\nThe first of the photos, which timestamps indicated were taken in the early hours of Sept. 4, show the woman lying on a carpeted floor bloodied and bruised. Later photos show her body on a luggage cart in the hotel\u2019s parking lot, wrapped in a white blanket, charging documents said. The final photos, which were taken on the morning of Sept. 6, show the woman\u2019s body face down in the back of a pickup truck.\n\nInvestigators \u2014 who had dealt with Smith in a previous investigation \u2014 recognized Smith\u2019s distinctive accent in the videos, according to court documents.\n\nAdditionally, investigators determined Smith had checked into a Marriott hotel in Anchorage from Sept. 2 to Sept. 4, which police said had the same carpeting featured in the photographs found on the SD card.\n\nCharging documents also claim that Smith owns a black pickup truck that matches the one seen in the photos, and that cellphone records place him within the vicinity of where the woman\u2019s body was found at the same time the final photos were taken.\n\nIn a statement, police thanked the woman who, after viewing the graphic images, turned the SD card in to authorities.\n\n\u201cThe Anchorage Police Department extends its gratitude to the citizen who stepped forward with the evidence of this crime,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThey played an instrumental role in making sure Smith will be held accountable for his actions. This serves as another example of when you see something suspicious, say something.\u201d", "description": "An Anchorage woman turned in an SD card she found on the street that contained videos and images of an alleged murder in a local hotel room", "authors": ["Gina Martinez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jOFLlDstWduupdEkozDOHw--~B/aD0xNDUxO3c9MjA2NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/20b1544e92fc913ea6c09437064742d3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
