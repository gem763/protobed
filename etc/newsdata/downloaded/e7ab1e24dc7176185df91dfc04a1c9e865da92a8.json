They are scheduled to appear in the Knysna Magistrate's Court later this week once they have been charged,\" Pojie said.\n\n\"An autopsy will be performed on the body of the deceased to determine the possible cause of death.\"", "description": "Hours after an elderly man was found tied up and dead in his home in Sedgefield, near Knysna, two suspects were arrested for murder and burglary, Western Cape police say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9335/ff097076f8a74255b8081d0df9745f21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
