For more than a decade, every People\u2019s Choice winner has gone on to score a best-picture Oscar nomination. Last year\u2019s winner, \u201cGreen Book,\u201d eventually won best picture.\n\n\u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d is a coming-of-age comedy about a 10-year-old boy named Jojo growing up in World War II Germany. His imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler, played by Waititi, the New Zealand filmmaker of \u201cThor Ragnarok\u201d and \u201cHunt for the Wilderpeople.\u201d\n\nThe film earned mixed reviews in Toronto, with some critics calling it Waititi\u2019s masterpiece and others \u2014 many of whom compared it to the 1997 Roberto Benigni Holocaust comic-drama \u201cLife is Beautiful\u201d \u2014 criticizing its off-kilter balance of tones.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

And, going by history, the film is practically assured of a promising Oscar campaign. \u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d which stars Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo alongside a cast including Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell, will be released by Fox Searchlight on Oct. 18.\n\nLast month, Variety reported that some executives for the Walt Disney Co., which earlier this year acquired Fox Searchlight, were concerned about \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d being too edgy for the company. But in an interview in Toronto, Waititi disputed that, saying Disney chief executive Bob Iger and chief creative officer Alan Horn \u201cgushed\u201d over the film.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018Watch out for that \u201cLife Is Beautiful\u201d movie. It\u2019s going to bring down the corporation,'\u201d Waititi said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to worry about this movie because once you see it, it speaks for itself. It\u2019s uplifting and it\u2019s a very positive message.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Choice runners up were Noah Baumbach\u2019s divorce drama \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d starring Adam Driver and Johansson, and Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite,\u201d a Korean class satire that won the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or in May.\n\nFeras Fayyad\u2019s \u201cThe Cave,\u201d about a team of female doctors clandestinely treating casualties in war-torn Syria, won Toronto\u2019s audience award for documentary. The festival earlier announced that Pietro Marcello\u2019s \u201cMartin Eden,\u201d an adaptation of the Jack London novel, won its juried Platform section.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Taika Waititi's Nazi Germany-set satire 'Jojo Rabbit' won the People's Choice award Sunday at the Toronto International Film Festival.", "authors": ["Jake Coyle"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/jojo-rabbit-wins-toronto-international-film-festival.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
