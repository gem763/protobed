(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)\n\nOne member of the Houston Astros has already blasted New York Yankees fans for their behavior in the ALCS, but the fan base might have reached a new low Thursday night.\n\nNJ.com\u2019s Brendan Kuty has reported that a group of Yankees fans seated around the visiting bullpen reportedly taunted Astros starter Zack Greinke in ways that crossed a line ahead of Game 4 of the ALCS.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAmong the subjects thrown at Greinke were the right-hander\u2019s well-documented struggles with anxiety and depression:\n\nChants digging at Greinke\u2019s battles with a social anxiety disorder and depression rained down on the 35-year-old right-hander as he threw to a catcher. Fans leaned over the concrete barrier between the stands and the bullpen and shouted insults about Greinke\u2019s mother, too. They also chanted \u201cDonald,\u201d Greinke\u2019s first name.\n\nKuty declined to print the exact chants directed at Greinke, but he revealed on Twitter that they referenced prescription medications.\n\nPolice officers in the bullpen and bleachers reportedly ejected one fan for his behavior regarding Greinke.\n\nSpeaking after the Astros 8-3 victory, Greinke downplayed the situation by telling reporters \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything,\u201d in regards to the reported taunts.\n\nGreinke opened the game with a shaky first inning in which he walked three batters, one with the bases loaded. Greinke finished with a line of 4 1/3 innings pitched, three hits allowed, four walks, five strikeouts and one earned run.\n\nYankees fans\u2019 treatment of Greinke also appeared in T-shirt form ahead of the game, with one fan going so far as to have a custom T-shirt made about the pitcher\u2019s wife.\n\nStory continues\n\nOMG THIS GUYS SHIRT LMAOOO pic.twitter.com/WfycaRXy9u \u2014 Valerie (@TheNYYBabe2) October 17, 2019\n\nClassy.\n\nAstros had complained about Yankees fans throwing objects on field\n\nThe ugliness surrounding Greinke\u2019s warm-ups came hours after Astros manager A.J. Hinch threatened to pull his team off the field if fans at Yankee Stadium threw debris onto the field as they had in Game 3.\n\nAstros outfielder Josh Reddick claimed to have seen water bottles and baseballs thrown into the outfield on Tuesday, with Hinch claiming objects were also thrown into the bullpen.\n\n\u201cI will pull the team off the field if we get in that situation again where bottles are being thrown and balls are being thrown and it becomes unruly,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cThere's other ways to support your home team, and this place does as good a job as anybody to trying to police that while also trying to create an environment that's all pro-Yankees.\n\n\u201cIt would be a very ugly scene for baseball, a very ugly scene for the Yankees, if one of our guys was hit by something from the upper deck. Something tragic could happen and nobody wants that.\u201d\n\nIt appears a certain set of Yankees fans opted to throw verbal garbage into the bullpen this time, and found yet another line to cross.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "An ugly scene reportedly broke out as Zack Greinke warmed up before Game 4 of the ALCS.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7HSsvN9OPqhFKzBn2MyFzg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ikg0uuM_9UR64Fo0Z90uAg--~B/aD0yNDM1O3c9MzY1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/45b74170-f156-11e9-8f99-bdbd5b908a1e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
