Venezuela's President, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, is shown above.\n\nThe U.S. imposed more sanctions targeting Venezuela\u2019s oil sector, blacklisting four entities and four related vessels for allegedly transporting oil from Venezuela to Cuba, the Treasury said on Tuesday.\n\nThe designations come after the U.S. blacklisted state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA, an important revenue generator for the country, in January, in a move to cripple Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government and empower opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3.\n\n\u201cMaduro\u2019s Cuban benefactors provide a lifeline to the regime and enable its repressive security and intelligence apparatus,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Treasury levied sanctions on Cyprus-based Caroil Transport Marine Ltd., which operates three vessels that the Treasury alleged recently delivered Venezuelan petroleum products to Cuba as part of an arrangement involving PdVSA, Cuba\u2019s state-run oil import-and-export company Cubametales and Cuban officials. The Treasury also blacklisted two Panama-based companies that are the registered owners of two of the vessels operated by Caroil Transport Marine. The U.S. in July blacklisted Cubametales for its continued importation of oil from Venezuela. A representative for Caroil Transport Marine didn\u2019t immediately provide a comment. Another Panamanian company that owns a crude oil tanker that allegedly delivered Venezuelan oil to Cuba recently was also blacklisted by the Treasury. The Treasury also removed sanctions on two Liberian entities and their vessels in recognition of a change of behavior, including discontinuing business and charter with Cubametales and adopting sanctions compliance measures, the department said.
