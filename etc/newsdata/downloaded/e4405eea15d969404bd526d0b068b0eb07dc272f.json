Shawn Porter pressured, prodded and exposed him during a title bout that stretched every bit of Spence\u2019s vaunted boxing skill.\n\nThe budding welterweight superstar emerged with two championship belts after he figured out the answers to this test just in time.\n\nErrol Spence Jr defeats Shawn Porter to unify IBF and WBC welterweight titles \u2013 live! Read more\n\nSpence added the WBC welterweight title to his IBF strap with a thrilling split-decision victory over Shawn Porter on Saturday night.\n\nSpence (26-0) persevered through the biggest challenge of his ascendant career from Porter (30-3-1), a veteran brawler who forced Spence into uncomfortable situations in nearly every round. Spence matched Porter\u2019s pace and landed more punches, and the Texan punctuated the win by knocking down Porter in the 11th round with a left hand.\n\n\u201cThis is a lifetime dream,\u201d Spence said. \u201cIt shows hard work pays off. \u2026 Shawn Porter is a rough and awkward fighter. I didn\u2019t get off what I wanted to. He\u2019s a true champion. He made it tough \u2026 (but) all my punches have bad intentions.\u201d\n\nTwo judges scored it 116-111 for Spence, and a third scored it 115-112 for Porter. (The Guardian scored it 114-113 for Spence.)\n\nPorter\u2019s unorthodox, pugnacious style baited the favored Spence into many wild exchanges, starting with a thrilling stretch of the third and fourth rounds. The pace rarely waned for the rest of the bout, with Porter constantly forcing a tough fight.\n\nBut Spence knocked down Porter with a spectacular left hand to the head with a minute left in the 11th round. The punch staggered Porter and rolled his eyes back, but he barely touched the canvas and went right back into the fight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a strong kid,\u201d Porter said. \u201cWe both came in to do the job. I think I had a little more than what he expected, but he handled it. Congratulations to him and his team. We\u2019re proud of what we did.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Errol Spence Jr celebrates after unifying the IBF and WBC welterweight titles.

But Spence landed 221 of those punches \u2013 49 more than Porter. Spence also landed 44% of his power punches to just 25.7% for Porter, whose inaccuracy has been a problem in an otherwise stellar career.\n\n\u201cPorter was throwing a lot,\u201d Spence said. \u201cI wanted to show I was the bigger and stronger welterweight.\u201d\n\nPorter was a double-digit underdog with some oddsmakers despite his stellar record and accomplishments. That\u2019s a measure of the boxing world\u2019s respect for Spence, who has been one of the brightest rising stars in the sport since he turned pro following the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut Porter appeared to be the toughest opponent of Spence\u2019s career, and it showed. Porter believed he could beat Spence by forcing a brawl on his skillful opponent, taking away Spence\u2019s space to put together combinations and using his awkward style to set up counterpunches.\n\nPorter\u2019s plan mostly succeeded, starting with a dynamite third round in which he absorbed body punches to deliver his own. Both fighters traded huge shots in a ramshackle three minutes of action, and they followed it with an equally exciting fourth in which each fighter rocked the other repeatedly.\n\nSpence was the more accurate fighter throughout the bout, and the judges noticed. None of his punches was bigger than the left hand in the 11th round, underlining his tactical skills with visceral evidence to the fans who loved Porter\u2019s wild aggression.\n\nWith his rangy athleticism and virtuosic skill, Spence has captured fans with a series of crisp victories in recent years. Spence won the IBF title in 2017 by stopping Kell Brook in England, and he defended it three times, culminating in a one-sided thrashing of undersized Mikey Garcia in March.\n\nBut Porter has been an elite welterweight for the past half-decade, rising to win the IBF title in 2013 before losing it to Brook. He rebounded from a much-hyped loss to Keith Thurman in 2016 with four straight victories, including a decision over Danny Garcia last year to claim the WBC belt.\n\nJosesito L\u00f3pez opened the pay-per-view show with an impressive eighth-round stoppage of fellow Southern California veteran welterweight John Molina Jr. L\u00f3pez (37-8, 20 KOs) knocked down Molina (30-9) twice in the first round and again in the seventh.\n\nMario Barrios claimed the WBA 140lb belt in his first world title shot with a narrow unanimous decision over Uzbek Olympian Batyr Akhmedov. Barrios (25-0), from San Antonio, knocked down Akhmedov (7-1) twice, but the Uzbek slugger largely dominated long stretches of the fight, leading fans to boo the scorecards of 114-112, 115-111 and 116-111 for Barrios.\n\nDavid Benavidez then won the WBC 168lb title with a ninth-round stoppage of Anthony Dirrell, who fought the final half of the fight with a ghastly cut on his right eyelid. The 22-year-old Benavidez (22-0), who controlled the bout before and after Dirrell\u2019s cut, reclaimed the belt he won in 2017 and lost last year after testing positive for cocaine.", "description": "The unbeaten Spence added the WBC welterweight title to his IBF strap with a thrilling split-decision victory on Saturday night in Los Angeles", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/670dff1caedb1280e5e5a671e910ecace519103f/0_64_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9028a52bf094d2f382dbd205766665d6", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
