When half a dozen trucks loaded with construction material screeched to a halt on their farms, Baryam Singh and fellow residents in the Indian village of Bobiya sensed they were soon going to lose more land to the military.\n\nThe farmers chased away the contractors and labourers with protests and threats of deflated tyres, knowing it was only a temporary reprieve.\n\n\"The military infrastructure has been growing in our village and our farmlands are shrinking,\" Singh told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, as other farmers sitting around him nodded.\n\n\"More than 50% of our agricultural land is under military lockdown,\" he said of the village on the border with Pakistan.\n\nOver the past 15 years, the Indian army and the country's Border Security Force (BSF) have been acquiring land to fortify defences in the border districts of Jammu and Kashmir, according to the Border Welfare Committee, a local organisation campaigning for the rights of border residents.\n\nBoth India and Pakistan administer the disputed state of Kashmir in part while claiming it in full.\n\nThe fertile land where Jammu and Kashmir meets Pakistan has become dotted with barbed wire and landmines, leaving hundreds of farmers cut off from their farms, often with no warning or compensation, said Bobiya villagers.\n\n\"This is adding to the economic distress of farmers who don't have alternative sources of livelihood,\" said Singh.\n\nAfter India revoked the autonomy of its portion of Kashmir in August, farmers in border areas now fear losing even more of their land to the military, according to ID Khajuria, an activist who heads up the Jammu and Kashmir Forum for Peace and Territorial Integrity.\n\nWith India bringing Jammu and Kashmir deeper into its fold, the central government will have greater power to seize territory in the border regions in the name of national security, he warned.\n\n\"The local elected political representatives will now have a very limited say in the functioning of the (Jammu and Kashmir) government,\" Khajuria said.\n\nJammu divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma said that all farmers in Jammu province would eventually be paid for their land.\n\n\"Whatever new agricultural land is being acquired, the farmers will get financial compensation,\" he said in a phone interview.\n\nSome have already been compensated, he added, though he declined to specify how many.\n\n'I AM LANDLESS NOW'\n\nThe defence system includes a fence of about 900 km (560 miles) in length that sits several kilometres into India from the border, slicing through villages and leaving vast tracts of farmland on the other side of the fence towards Pakistan.\n\nIndia's government is also working on a \"Wall of Defence\" along the border between India and Pakistan, according to the Border Security Force.\n\nThe project consists of a 10-metre-high (32-foot) mud embankment to protect residents of India's border villages from frequent ceasefire violations that both sides blame on each other.\n\nThere are also plans to install high-tech surveillance systems to plug gaps where physical surveillance is not possible, India's ministry of home affairs announced last year.\n\nMembers of the Border Welfare Committee - which is based in the city of K athua - said that thousands of hectares of Indian farmland now sit untouched on the other side of the fence.\n\nTechnically, farmers can still get to their land, but the checkpoints in the fence are opened only during specific times of day and farmers have to walk for hours to reach their fields, explained Bharat Bhushan Sharma, the committee's vice president.\n\nEven if they do manage to successfully cultivate their crops, \"there is always a threat of cross-border fire\", said Sharma, who is also head of Bobiya village.\n\n\"And then (they) can't protect their crops from wild animals.\"\n\nCommittee president Nanak Chand, 87, said he lost almost eight hectares of land to the fence when it was first built in 2004.\n\n\"Three months ago, the military acquired the remaining two hectares of farmland as well,\" he said. \"I am landless now.\"\n\nChand was given 3 million rupees ($42,000) as compensation, which he says is not enough to buy himself an equivalent piece of land in a peaceful part of the country.\n\nKhajuria agreed, saying that \"with developers and businessmen from other states rushing to Jammu and Kashmir, land prices are likely to soar and it would make it difficult for poor border residents to buy land in peaceful areas.\"", "description": "When half a dozen trucks loaded with construction material screeched to a halt on their farms, Baryam Singh and fellow residents in the Indian village of Bobiya sensed they were soon going to lose more land to the military.  \"The military infrastructure has been growing in our village and our farmlands", "authors": ["Ashutosh Sharma", "Thomson Reuters Foundation"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
