In the Bulgarian championship, we have a lot of players of different ethnicities and skin colour,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we have this big problem like, for example, England do.\u201d\n\nAmid suggestions England will walk off the pitch if there is any racism in Bulgaria, the team held a meeting last week to discuss how they will react at the Vasil Levski stadium.\n\nHowever, Southgate, who has repeatedly said England need to get their own house in order over racism, was keen to focus on the match rather than get dragged into more mud-throwing.\n\n\u201cWell I say the same as I said the other night in Prague. We are guests in another country and I have always said we have as many issues in own country to resolve than anywhere else,\u201d Southgate said in a press conference broadcast on Sky Sports News.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants us to talk about football, for the players and both teams the same.\n\n\u201cWe had to prepare our players for what happened in Montenegro, so that was a process that we needed to go through before our next away fixtures.\n\n\u201cOutside of that, we trust the authorities to make sure everything is in place and everybody involved in the game from both countries is wanting to talk about the match.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Self-reflective\u2019 \u2013\n\nEngland lost their first European or World Cup qualifier in a decade in a 2-1 defeat against the Czech Republic last week.\n\nA win in Prague would have booked England\u2019s place at Euro 2020 and Southgate said his Group A leaders are keen to make amends for that missed opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe have a very honest group and are very self-reflective. They don\u2019t need me to tell them when they haven\u2019t played at the level they can,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe key is always to recover from the result. We have to move forward and focus on tomorrow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think defeats harm teams if the reaction is good. Then what you learn from defeats and the resilience from defeats are important parts of a player\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cI have always maintained that we have to qualify, and we haven\u2019t secured that qualification yet and our focus tomorrow is to get the performance and result.\u201d\n\nSouthgate is reported to be considering using the three-man defensive formation which he favoured during last year\u2019s run to the World Cup semi-finals.\n\nBut the England manager would only say \u201cWe are always looking at every aspect. We train and have meetings specifically on every area of the performance. There is always particular focus when an area is not going too well.\n\n\u201cIn terms of tactical adjustments, we are always thinking about the best way to get the best players on the field, be the most dangerous, to get the best of our strengths but hide our weaknesses.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Gareth Southgate refused to be embroiled in a war of words with Krasimir Balakov after the Bulgaria manager said England has more", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/3230fc_england-manager-gareth-southgate-expects-his-bounce-bulgaria-southgate-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
