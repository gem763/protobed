Questions will pop-up on the screen that they answer. The AI analyzes their facial movements, voice tone and choice of words during the 30-minute interview. Following the HireVue test, the AI creates a report card based on their 'competencies and behaviors,' including their 'willingness to learn,' 'conscientiousness & responsibility' and 'personal stability.' These personality traits then group individuals into high, medium and low tiers based on their 'likelihood of success.'\n\nMeredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the AI Now Institute, a research center in New York, said, 'It's a profoundly disturbing development that we have proprietary technology that claims to differentiate between a productive worker and a worker who isn't fit, based on their facial movements, their tone of voice, their mannerisms.'\n\n'It's pseudoscience. It's a license to discriminate,' she added.\n\n'And the people whose lives and opportunities are literally being shaped by these systems don't have any chance to weigh in.'\n\nThe assessment system connects to the candidate's smartphone, tablet or computer camera, giving the AI a front row seat to the candidate's facial movements, word choice and speaking voice.\n\nNathan Mondragon, HireVue's chief industrial-organizational psychologist, told The Post the interviews are about 30 minutes and include more than a dozen questions that can 'yield up to 500,000 data points', which create the individual's personal score.\n\nQuestions are created by the employer, which are shown on the device for the interviewee to see and answer.\n\nThe system connects to the candidate's smartphone, tablet or computer camera, allowing the potential employers to not only see them, but also gives the AI system a front row seat to the candidate's facial movements, word choice and speaking voice\n\nDuring this part of the interview, the AI monitors the person's facial movements, which can reveal how excitable they are is or how easily angered they can be.\n\nThe AI gathers information from the interview and ranks what it has learned about the candidate against other applicants who have also interviewed for the same position.\n\nThose 'Facial Action Units,' Mondragon said, can make up 29 percent of a person's score; the words they say and the 'audio features' of their voice, like tone, determine the rest.\n\nThe AI creates a report card based on 'competencies and behaviors,' including their 'willingness to learn,' 'conscientiousness & responsibility' and 'personal stability.' These personality traits then group individuals into high, medium and low tiers based on their 'likelihood of success'\n\n'Humans are inconsistent by nature. They inject their subjectivity into the evaluations,' Mondragon said.\n\nThe system is trained using interviews from current employees in the position and their responses are crosschecked with a 'benchmark of success' , such as how well they met a sales quotas or how quickly they'd resolved customer calls.\n\nAnd the best candidates for the position tend to mirror those who have already excelled in the position.\n\nFollowing the HireVue test, the AI creates a report card based on their 'competencies and behaviors,' including their 'willingness to learn,' 'conscientiousness & responsibility' and 'personal stability.'\n\nThese personality traits then group individuals into high, medium and low tiers based on their 'likelihood of success.'\n\nAlthough employers can choose who to purse, several have told The Post that they usually focused on those the computer system liked best.", "description": "Big name firms, like Hilton and Goldman Sachs, are using an AI assessment system to find the perfect candidate, which scores applicants on facial movements, voice and word choice.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/14/20084922-0-image-a-2_1571837694696.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
