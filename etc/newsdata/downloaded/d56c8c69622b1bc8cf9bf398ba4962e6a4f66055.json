Boone Pickens\u2018 death.\n\nPickens, a 1951 graduate of what then was Oklahoma A&M;, died Wednesday at age 91 . Much of the $652 million he donated to Oklahoma State went to athletic facilities, including the football stadium that bears his name. An Oklahoma State spokesman said the Cowboys will wear helmet stickers in his honor.\n\n\u201cThe greatest Cowboy of them all has taken his last ride,\u201d Oklahoma State athletic director Mike Holder said in a statement. \u201cIt will never be the same again. We could never thank him enough for all that he did for our university. He gave us everything he had, and all that he asked in return was that we play by the rules and dream big. He was living proof that anything is possible if you\u2019re wearing orange. \u2018Great ride Cowboy, great ride!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys opened with a 52-36 win at Oregon State and followed that with a 56-14 win over McNeese State. The Cowboys rank eighth nationally in total offense and ninth in scoring offense.\n\nIt will be a tough task for Tulsa in its home opener.\n\n\u201cJust like always, they\u2019re very potent on offense,\u201d Tulsa coach Philip Montgomery said. \u201cThey\u2019re very sound and aggressive defensively. So we know we got our hands __ we know we have our job cut out for us, but we\u2019re excited about the opportunity and ready to be at home.\u201d\n\nThe Golden Hurricane lost their opener 28-7 at Michigan State, but bounced back last week to defeat San Jose State 34-16.\n\n\u201cThey played excellent, in my opinion, at Michigan State and out west over the weekend,\u201d Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said. \u201cThey put It together offensively the other night out against San Jose State.\u201d\n\nWALLACE\u2019S WHEELS\n\nOklahoma State\u2019s Tylan Wallace has picked up where he left off last year. Last season, Wallace caught 86 passes for 1,491 yards and 12 touchdowns. This season, he\u2019s tied for the national lead with five touchdown receptions. The preseason AP All-American gained 180 yards and three touchdowns on just five receptions against McNeese State - a performance that left an impression on Montgomery.\n\n\u201cHis first touchdown the other night, they\u2019re just throwing a little now out to him and he gets back outside, makes one guy miss and then he outruns three or four other ones down the sidelines,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cSo had a lot of YAC (yards after catch) to that play, but he\u2019s also stretched the field.\u201d\n\nTULSA\u2018S DEFENSE\n\nFor years, Tulsa has been known for its prolific offensive play. So far, it\u2019s a steady defense that has kept the Golden Hurricane competitive. Linebacker Cooper Edmiston leads the way with 19 tackles. Defensive end Trevis Gipson has 4.5 tackles for loss already.\n\n\u201cI just like how they play,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cI think they are a good defense and they are playing well.\u201d\n\nSPECTACULAR SANDERS\n\nQuarterback Spencer Sanders was named the Big 12 Newcomer of the Week after passing for 250 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for 51 yards against McNeese. He ranks fifth nationally in passer efficiency rating.\n\nCHUBA HUBBARD\n\nOklahoma State running back Chuba Hubbard looks to bounce back after a rough week. He opened the season with 221 yards and three touchdowns against Oregon State, but he had just eight carries for 44 yards against McNeese State and fumbled once, though Oklahoma State recovered. Gundy said it wasn\u2019t all Hubbard\u2019s fault.\n\n\u201cThe offensive line was average and Chuba put the ball on the ground,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIf you put the ball on the ground, you\u2019re out. He\u2019s not going to get his carries if he fumbles, and the offensive line was average.\u201d\n\nONE-TWO PUNCH\n\nTulsa\u2019s Shamari Brooks had his ninth career game with at least 100 yards against San Jose State with 140 yards on 29 carries. He has 1,794 yards rushing and 18 touchdowns in his career. Corey Taylor has 1,034 career yards rushing and 15 scores. He has just 10 carries this season, but has proven capable. The backs could be important as Tulsa tries to control the pace and keep Oklahoma State\u2019s offense off the field.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Oklahoma State will play at Tulsa on Saturday in its first game since billionaire donor T.
