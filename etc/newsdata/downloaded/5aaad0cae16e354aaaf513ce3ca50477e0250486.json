He told us how the blowback led to a new retail model that's outperformed expectations.\n\nThings became shaky between the two companies early last year, as Dick's saw lagging Under Armour sales in its stores. In March 2018, Stack told Wall Street analysts that \"significant weakness\" on Under Armour's part hurt Dick's overall performance. Specifically, the Dick's CEO called out Under Armour's \"expanded distribution\" strategy, which saw the Baltimore-based clothing company partnering with other retailers like Kohl's.\n\nSpeaking with Business Insider about his book \"It's How We Play the Game\" on October 7, Stack said that Dick's has \"re-engineered what we're going to do with Under Armour.\"\n\n\"The Under Armour business was down for probably five quarters in a row after they made the changes in their distribution strategy,\" Stack told Business Insider.\n\nBut since then, Stack said, the partnership has gotten back into shape. Specifically, Under Armour's brand collaboration with the Rock has stabilized the partnership.\n\n\"We made a big presence on Under Armour around The Rock \u2014 Dwayne Johnson \u2014 which has been great,\" Stack said. Hollis Johnson / Business Insider\n\n\"We made a big presence on Under Armour around The Rock \u2014 Dwayne Johnson \u2014 which has been great,\" Stack said. \"It has really helped re-energize the Under Armour brand in our stores. We're on pretty solid footing with Under Armour now.\"\n\nJohnson's own partnership with Under Armour dates back to 2015, when he signed a \"long-term\" contract to team up on an apparel and footwear brand. Like Stack, Johnson has voiced his own concerns about Under Armour in the past. However, the actor's qualms were political in nature. He was one of the celebrities to criticize the company's CEO Kevin Plank for praising US President Donald Trump as a \"pro-business president\" back in 2017.\n\nToday, the Project Rock brand features products like shoes, t-shirts, athletic pants, leggings, and socks.\n\nJohnson isn't the only star whom Dick's has hitched its wagon to. The sporting goods retailer also partnered with singer Carrie Underwood for its private-label Calia brand, which features women's fitness apparel.\n\n\"The private brand business continues to be something that we're very aggressive on,\" Stack said.", "description": "Dick's Sporting Goods has also partnered up with singer Carrie Underwood for a private-label collection.", "authors": ["Richard Feloni", "\u00c1ine Cain"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5feaacc4a0a7f7d6fe9c4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
