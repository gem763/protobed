Parasite is the culmination of his abilities; it morphs from thriller to slapstick to black comedy to horror with both playful ease and tightly orchestrated precision. It\u2019s a movie only Bong could have made: ferocious, bracingly critical of the absurdities of late-stage capitalism, yet fun and never priggish. It\u2019s one of the best films of the year.\n\nParasite offers mirrored images of two families: the ultra-wealthy Park clan and the destitute Kims, each composed of a father, mother, daughter, and son. Where the Parks reside in a sleek and secure fortress designed by a name-brand architect, the Kims live in a cluttered, bug-infested semi-basement apartment where their view of the street (through a thin slit of a window) frequently includes a drunkard pissing. The Kims are a resourceful and industrious bunch, but gig after gig has dried up, leaving them folding pizza boxes for pennies.\n\nBy the time we see son Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam) chase down free Wi-fi signals around the apartment, it\u2019s clear why they might reach for any income opportunity available. Ki-woo stumbles on the perfect one: as an English tutor for the Park family\u2019s teen daughter, Da-hye. His first visit to the Park\u2019s place stings with wonder and shock; his eyes eat up the verdant backyard, the window spanning an entire wall, the spotless floors and high ceilings. Even the housekeeper wears clothing so prim he mistakes her for the owner.\n\nKi-woo\u2019s shock wears off quickly enough, though, for him to start leveraging what he learns about the Parks to benefit his own family. One off-handed mention of their troubled youngest son\u2019s need for an \u201cart therapist,\u201d and Ki-woo successfully installs his sister (whom he pretends to know only as a distant cousin\u2019s classmate) as another Kim on the Park family\u2019s payroll. No detail proves too small\u2014from their housekeeper\u2019s peach allergy to the driver\u2019s generosity\u2014nor method too depraved for the Kim family to scam their way into four separate streams of Park fortune-derived income.\n\nYet the fact remains: the goal of this giddy, wild heist isn\u2019t diamonds or gold. It\u2019s just the opportunity to work for a living wage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fraud and crimes in the film, but I think it\u2019s really a representation of all of us who are trying to adapt to a changing environment,\u201d actor Song Kang-ho, who plays Kim family patriarch Ki-taek, tells The Daily Beast through a translator. \u201cIf you look at the family in the film, they really strive to achieve that.\u201d\n\nSong is sitting (dressed impeccably in a dark turtleneck, blazer, and leather loafers) across from his screen counterpart\u2019s son, 29-year-old actor Choi Woo-shik, who nods and speaks in English: \u201cThey are facing economic problems, but that doesn\u2019t make you less of a person. Our family is a really loving family. We care about each other, just as Park\u2019s family does.\u201d\n\nSong watches as Choi talks, a slow smile forming. \u201cYou sound so intelligent,\u201d he quips in Korean, drawing roars of laughter from his onscreen daughter, 28-year-old Park So-dam, sitting to his left. Choi pushes up a pair of gold-rimmed frames, pretending to be flattered: \u201cIt\u2019s the glasses.\u201d\n\nThe three are gathered in a New York hotel room the week of Parasite\u2019s U.S. release, their family dynamic still firmly intact. (The Kims are rowdier, more honest with one another, and closer than the Parks, though Bong and co-screenwriter Jin Won Han staunchly resist villainizing or martyring either family.) Laughter now aside, Park adds to the Kim family\u2019s perspective: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much about \u2018We don\u2019t have it and we want that,\u2019\u201d she says of how they view wealth. \u201cIt\u2019s more that we had a different starting point.\u201d\n\nAt the height of their ambition, the Kim family dreams of having in-laws like the Parks. Asking favors, maybe staying over. Enjoying the snacks, alcohol, and endless sunlight that pours into the garden. (They take full advantage of a weekend when the Parks are out of town.) But the secrets they\u2019ve kept become harder to sustain with the revelation of another, uglier hidden cost of wealth\u2014one that sends the film careening toward an inevitable eruption of violence.\n\nLike the rest of the film, the scene is best experienced knowing as little as possible going in. If you haven\u2019t yet seen Parasite, do that first\u2014it\u2019s in theaters today\u2014then come back once you\u2019ve pieced yourself back together.\n\nAt once both devastating and illuminating, Parasite\u2019s blood-splattered finale is the kind you can neither predict nor forget.\n\nGeun-se, husband to the Parks\u2019 original housekeeper and the personified \u201cghost\u201d of human labor, is revealed to have been living in a sunless concrete bunker under the family home for years. He worships the Park family patriarch, flashes Morse code thank-yous to the family upstairs, and barks the English word \u201crespect!\u201d at magazine cutouts of the glamorous Mr. Park. Geun-se and his wife, Moon-gwang, learn the Kims\u2019 secret\u2014that they are related, lied to get Moon-gwang fired, and that a simple text to the Parks could doom them\u2014through no fault of their own: Ki-woo blurts out \u201cdad\u201d when addressing Ki-taek in front of them.\n\nThe Kim family\u2019s violent scramble to suppress the fallout (and keep their jobs) leads to all-out war. The Parks arrange a birthday party outside in the garden, ordering the tension-wracked Kims\u2014who are here on their day off\u2014from one whim to the next.\n\nThen Bong snaps his puzzle together\u2014before he smashes it to shreds as Ki-taek snaps in a scene of bloody carnage.\n\n\u201cI think the essential reason that character snapped is not really the income difference between the wealthy and poor,\u201d says Song. \u201cIt actually has to do with human dignity. The collapse of it leads the character to take this extreme measure.\u201d The film, as he sees it, is about the recovery of that dignity, with Ki-taek\u2019s act of desperation his final attempt. \u201cThe characters in the film have a lot of antagonistic feelings toward each other.\u201d But in his estimation, \u201cthe problem really lies in what they held at their hearts.\u201d\n\nParasite\u2019s script alone did not paint a specific \u201cimage\u201d of how the scene would unfold, Choi and Song remember. Still, the actors understood the tension that coils until it snaps, and the \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201cchaos\u201d that would break loose. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d Choi remembers. \u201cPeople were on edge, \u2019cause it was really one of our most difficult scenes to shoot. There were so many people there and so much movement in front of the camera.\u201d\n\nPark remembers Bong\u2019s instructions to her for the scene: \u201cHe didn\u2019t want Ki-jung to look like she was going to die,\u201d she laughs. \u201cHe wanted that to not be foreseen. So I was asked to just say anything that came to mind. I had to think about how I can be stabbed in the heart but not look like this is my dying will. That was a difficult request to fulfill.\u201d\n\nBong storyboarded Parasite himself; his sketches resemble the pages of a comic book, with detailed indications of movement, dialogue, and camera placement. The fictional Park family\u2019s house, Park remembers, \u201cwas based on the storyboard, not the other way around, to the point that the art director was saying this kind of architecture wouldn\u2019t work for a real house.\u201d With Bong\u2019s storyboards as \u201cthe backbone of the film,\u201d actors enjoyed a certain flexibility: \u201cIt was actually much more fun than my other experiences,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it allowed me more freedom. I knew exactly where my boundaries were but could also play around within the scene.\u201d\n\nWoo-shik, who has worked with Bong twice (first on Okja), confesses to being \u201creally nervous\u201d the second time around, too. \u201cBut he\u2019s one of those guys who makes the atmosphere really comfortable. He\u2019s like a loving teddy bear,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cOn set, we could just do anything. He didn\u2019t give us any limitations about where we could act or move. It was just a really fun and comfortable, loving set.\u201d\n\n\u201c The film is essentially about the recovery of human dignity. \u201d \u2014 Song Kang-ho\n\nBut it\u2019s Song, 52, who has the most intimate creative partnership with \u201cDirector Bong,\u201d stretching back to their first onscreen collaboration in 2003, Memories of Murder. Bong speaks often and glowingly about his trust in Song\u2019s abilities and feeling emboldened to take risks in the films they make together. When Parasite won the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s top prize (an overdue first for a South Korean film), Song was at his side\u2014the director even knelt before Song at a photo call on the red carpet, playfully offering his muse the Palme d\u2019Or.\n\n\u201cThere is no significant change ever since I started working with him more than 20 years ago,\u201d Song says, chuckling a bit at the word \u201cmuse.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of respect between us, a lot of expectations, and I always feel a sense of thrill as I look forward to working with him.\u201d\n\nBetween Memories of Murder and Parasite, Song has acted the part of the boisterous, likable everyman in Bong\u2019s allegorical kaiju movie The Host (2006) and in the sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer (2013). \u201cI think over the years, Bong has had this very sharp and perceptive view of life itself,\u201d Song adds. \u201cAnd you can really see the evolution of that in this movie. It\u2019s the crystallization of all those efforts. If you look at what he\u2019s done so far, I do think it\u2019s very admirable, and I do want to pay my respect to his talent.\u201d\n\nAs if possessed by the English word leaving his translator\u2019s mouth, Song sits up suddenly and barks \u201cRESPECT!\u201d, relishing the reaction he detonates in the room. It\u2019s not quite the chaos of a bloody finale exposing the dehumanization at the heart of capitalism. But it\u2019s something close.", "description": "The South Korean auteur has created another classic in this genre-bending masterpiece.
