Depending on where you live, it might even be celebrated by your city tonight.\n\nIf you have an Amazon Alexa device, then it can come in handy setting the scene for trick-or-treaters and party guests.\n\nAmazon has Spooky Halloween Sounds available by default on the device. To activate it, just say \u201cAlexa, start Spooky Halloween Sounds\u201d and a loop of creepy sounds will start going.\n\nIf you have Spotify or Pandora enabled on your device, you can also ask it to play a Halloween playlist from either service through the smart speaker.\n\nI\u2019m also a tremendous fan of the Spooky Scream skill. Once enabled, you can have it scream after a set time. For instance, you can set it to scream an hour from now and terrify your spouse/roommate while you\u2019re not even in the room anymore.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a quick, fun Halloween-themed moment, you can also ask Alexa to \u201cTell me a scary story\u201d which will result in a roughly 20-second clip of a scary poem. None of them are all that scary, from my experience, but they can be fun to listen to nonetheless.", "description": "Halloween is just a few days away.
