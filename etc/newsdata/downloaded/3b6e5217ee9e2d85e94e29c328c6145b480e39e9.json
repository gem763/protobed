Of course, they all have a downside.

Forrester's emerging tech spotlights have previously identified and characterized the various emerging technologies that are worth your time.\n\nTo help you figure out how to best consume them, Will McKeon-White and I did our best to help simplify this shifting landscape in our latest report, written as a downloadable PowerPoint file: \"Use The Cloud Platforms To Drive Your Tech-Driven Innovations.\"\n\nFrom this research, we came across three key takeaways:\n\nDon't assume your business can't be enhanced by the technologies covered. From healthcare to manufacturing and construction to higher education, adopters of emerging technologies are finding new and innovative ways to enhance what their companies can do. Don't immediately write off using emerging technologies in your organization because you're unsure of how they can fit.\n\nFrom healthcare to manufacturing and construction to higher education, adopters of emerging technologies are finding new and innovative ways to enhance what their companies can do. Don't immediately write off using emerging technologies in your organization because you're unsure of how they can fit. Open source is accelerating, but some technologies are far more proprietary than others. From providing a larger, more engaged development base to enabling deployment flexibility, open-source is ever-growing in popularity, and for good reason. Today, it's far more prevalent in some technologies than others, and vendors are increasingly embracing this trend. Open-source technologies that are currently explicitly proprietary will not only drive innovation but likely adoption, as well.\n\nFrom providing a larger, more engaged development base to enabling deployment flexibility, open-source is ever-growing in popularity, and for good reason.

Open-source technologies that are currently explicitly proprietary will not only drive innovation but likely adoption, as well. Breadth and strength of services is defining the next wave of cloud competition, and vendors know it. While infrastructure-as-a-service is still a growth market, a status quo has already arisen, one that is unlikely to change rapidly. As such, vendors have realized that next-generation services are their next avenue for net-new competition and are now being fiercely pursued by every vendor covered. This change is rapidly shifting the established market dynamics of the cloud, further contributing to the multi-cloud reality.\n\nAnd while we've touched upon some of the contents of this report in our cloud empowerment webinar and video blog so far, to provide more context on what the PowerPoint contains, we provide a breakdown of the various solutions/services offered by the major cloud providers (Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, IBM, Microsoft Azure, Oracle, and Salesforce) for the following 10 technologies:\n\nComputer vision refers to a family of tools and technologies used to analyze images and video to understand the objects and features of objects contained in said images.\n\nrefers to a family of tools and technologies used to analyze images and video to understand the objects and features of objects contained in said images.

Serverless computing is a form of server architecture designed to further abstract development, compute, and run resources from servers \u2014 an evolution beyond virtualization -- further removing the need for the infrastructure management and maintenance of servers and instances.\n\nis a form of server architecture designed to further abstract development, compute, and run resources from servers \u2014 an evolution beyond virtualization -- further removing the need for the infrastructure management and maintenance of servers and instances. Quantum computing is an emerging computing paradigm and very much still in the R&D stage -- we've yet to see the creation of a true quantum computer, but the technology is one that promises to rapidly increase computing power and efficiency.\n\nThis downloadable PPT also covers:\n\nEach solution's availability in the market today -- is it generally available, is it in beta (or a similar program), or is it still in development and not available today?\n\nin the market today -- is it generally available, is it in beta (or a similar program), or is it still in development and not available today?
