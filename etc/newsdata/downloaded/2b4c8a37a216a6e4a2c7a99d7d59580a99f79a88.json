In fact he is considering expanding the scheme to even more vulnerable categories of people.\n\nSee also: Centrelink's new data-matching project targets Medicare fraud\n\n\"This is not in keeping with our traditional values of a fair go. It is unAustralian.\"\n\nShorten again called for the OCI project to be scrapped.\n\nDHS in March last year told a Finance and Public Administration References Committee that its data-matching program went well because it produced savings, but this ignored claims from individuals that the OCI system caused them feelings of anxiety, fear, and humiliation, and reportedly even resulted in suicide.\n\nMinister for Government Services Stuart Robert has also responded to pleas to stop the program by saying that the government has a lawful responsibility to collect \"where citizens have mismatched what they said they'd earn versus what, through their tax return, they've been shown to earn\".\n\nAccording to Robert, across Australia, as at 30 June 2019, there were 1.54 million outstanding social welfare debts he claims have a value just shy of AU$5 billion.\n\nWhile the Coalition claims AU$1.9 billion has been returned funds thanks to robo-debt, the program has cost AU$375 million so far, but has only recovered a little over AU$326 million in overpayments, while at least 31,000 debt claims have been wiped.\n\nShorten's accusations come the same day the Australian Data and Digital Council, chaired by Robert, agreed to establish a National Disability Data Asset, which will compile data on those in the country living with disability.\n\nREAD MORE", "description": "Apparently all you need to do to get a Centrelink debt wiped is show up in court to contest it.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/06/13/b10f6274-2f6d-4f99-8e6e-42f801931824/thumbnail/770x578/1c4eff061779d4095126e39cf3a8fb80/centrelink-medicare-shop-front-sign.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
