General Assembly on Tuesday.\n\nIn practice, this meant both a general call to respect national sovereignty and a specific warning that non-Arab powers should not meddle in the affairs of Arab nations, a warning Sisi repeated in several different contexts throughout his address.\n\nSisi saluted his administration for embarking upon \u201can ambitious plan to comprehensively advance society,\u201d including \u201cdecisively combating terrorism and launching the most ambitious economic reform in [Egypt\u2019s] modern history.\u201d\n\nHe said these reforms were \u201cwholeheartedly embraced by the Egyptian people, who have graciously shouldered the burden of their successful implementation in a manner that exceeded all expectations.\u201d\n\nReminding the audience that Egypt currently chairs the African Union, Sisi praised the \u201cprinciple of African solutions to African problems,\u201d a \u201ccontinent-wide vision that is based on our common history, unity of destiny, and confidence in our ability to achieve progress towards integration and upholding the interests of our peoples.\u201d\n\nSisi praised initiatives like the African Union Center for Reconstruction and Development and the Aswan Forum for Sustainable Peace and Development as positive steps toward realizing the potential of Africa, but the balance of his speech laid out some problems that have proven painfully resistant to both \u201cAfrican solutions\u201d and U.N. multilateralism, such as the savage civil wars in Yemen and Syria and the utter disintegration of Libya.\n\nIn each case, Sisi declared the urgent need for \u201cpolitical\u201d solutions but offered few suggestions for what those solutions would look like.\n\n\u201cI say that the time has come to take a decisive stance to end the protracted crisis in Yemen through the implementation of a political solution based on the well-known parameters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to end foreign interventions by non-Arab regional parties which seek to curtail Arab national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also need to address the unprecedented threats facing the Arabian Gulf region, including threats facing navigation, as well as recent attacks on oil installations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\u201d he added. Those attacks were the work of Iran, which is also the primary \u201cnon-Arab regional party\u201d involved in the Yemeni civil war. Sisi did not call the Iranians out by name.\n\nOn the \u201cprotracted crisis\u201d in Libya, Sisi said the conflict \u201cneeds to be stopped\u201d by taking a \u201cbold and decisive stand to address the root causes of the Libyan crisis comprehensively.\u201d\n\nSisi said part of this comprehensive solution would involve \u201caddressing the grave imbalance of the distribution of wealth and power, and the absence of public oversight by the Libyan people\u2019s elected representatives over political and economic decision-making.\u201d He decried the influence of local militias and foreign powers on the chaos in Libya.\n\nSisi called for an equally comprehensive solution to the \u201clongest-standing crisis in the Middle East, namely the Palestinian cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe persistence of this cause without a just solution based on international resolutions calling for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital does not only mean the continuation of the plight of the Palestinian people, but it also entails the continued depletion of the resources of the peoples of the Middle East,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI say that Arabs are open to the realization of a just and comprehensive peace,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe Arab peace initiative is still on the table, and there remains an opportunity to launch a new phase in the Middle East. However, we need bold decisions that restore the rights to the Palestinians that pave the way for a major change in the reality of this region.\u201d\n\nSisi promised that if the Palestinian issue is resolved in this way, it would \u201clead to the establishment of a security and economic system in the Middle East that is based on peace, security, cooperation, and common interests.\u201d\n\nSisi stressed the importance of combating terrorism \u201cby confronting all terrorist organizations with no exception\u201d and holding accountable \u201call those who support terrorism, whether through funding, or whether through weapons, or whether through safe havens or media platforms.\u201d\n\nThe Egyptian president called on the United Nations to address the \u201cimbalance in the composition and the shortcomings in the decision-making process\u201d of the U.N. Security Council.\n\n\u201cWe must guarantee a balanced representation in the Security Council, and with regard to our African continent, we must work to rectify the historical injustice our continent has been subject to,\u201d he said.", "description": "Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi denounced the wars in Yemen, Libya, Syria, and attack on Saudi Arabia during U.N. address.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1170765287-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
