I\u2019m not voting for Yang but I\u2019d definitely be his friend,\" she wrote.\n\nNYT WALKS BACK NEW KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' BY POSTING MAJOR REVISION\n\nPresident Trump noticed the tweet and responded, \"I'm OK with that!\"\n\nDillon said her viewpoint comes down to the results of the Trump administration.\n\n\"Results are more important than rhetoric. ... While I don't like some things he tweets or says, I do want to vote for him,\" she said, noting the Supreme Court justices picked by the president, Trump's foreign policy achievements and support for Israel.\n\nDillon said she believes Yang is a \"genuine person\" who is having fun on the campaign trail, while his many Democratic presidential rivals are \"trying too hard\" to impress voters.\n\nDIGENOVA: MCCABE PROSECUTION WOULD START HOLDING OBAMA OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANTI-TRUMP ABUSES\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe said the response was \"completely overwhelming\" after Trump tweeted at her and she \"can't believe\" how many people agree with her original sentiment.\n\n\"He's really protecting the religious community, he's pro-life and there's a lot of different things he's delivering on and I think it's really important to look beyond just the rhetoric,\" said Dillon.\n\nYang made headlines last week by announcing that he would distribute $1,000 a month to 10 Americans chosen at random. Yang's support for a universal basic income, which he calls the Freedom Dividend, has been a centerpiece of his campaign.", "description": "A young conservative writer got President Trump's attention over the weekend with a viral tweet, as she explained why she likes Andrew Yang but would still vote to re-elect the president.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Andrew-Yang-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
