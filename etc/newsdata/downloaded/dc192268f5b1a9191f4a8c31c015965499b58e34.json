To celebrate, Leafly is hosting a 16-city tour across North America to bring Leafly Learn directly to budtenders. Leafly Learn and the Budtender Education Tour will teach budtenders about the science of cannabis and how it can be applied to budtender best practices in order to help customers discover the products best suited for their needs.\n\n\u201cBudtenders are the face of the cannabis industry and the frontline for guiding customers toward products that will work best for them,\u201d said Rebecca Kelley, content director at Leafly. \u201cWe built Leafly Learn with an understanding of the crucial role budtenders play in educating customers, and created this learning platform so that budtenders everywhere can feel supported in their careers and have more confidence in their product recommendations.\u201d\n\nLeafly Learn will be exclusively available to retailer clients of Leafly, who can use the curriculum and the newly unveiled Leafly Cannabis Guide to provide training to budtenders as part of their professional development. According to the 2019 Leafly Jobs Report, there are more than 211,000 jobs in legal cannabis, many of which are budtenders new to the industry. According to a recent industry report, more than 90 per cent of consumers seriously consider a budtender\u2019s recommendation when making a purchase decision, highlighting the need for budtender education efforts like Leafly Learn.\n\nTo kick off this initiative, Leafly is taking Leafly Learn on the road to 16 cities across North America, meeting directly with thousands of budtenders to provide hands-on training based on the Leafly Cannabis Guide:\n\nLeafly Learn Budtender Education Tour\n\nPhoenix, AZ: October 7, 2019\n\nLos Angeles, CA: October 10, 2019\n\nPortland, OR: October 12, 2019\n\nVancouver, Canada: October 17, 2019\n\nSeattle, WA: October 24-25, 2019\n\nCalgary, Canada: October 30, 2019\n\nChicago, IL: November 4, 2019\n\nDetroit, MI: November 5, 2019\n\nToronto, Canada: November 8, 2019\n\nBoston, MA: November 11, 2019\n\nBaltimore, MD: November 13, 2019\n\nOrlando, FL: November 19, 2019\n\nMiami, FL: November 21, 2019\n\nOklahoma City, OK: December 1, 2019\n\nDenver, CO: December 4, 2019\n\nLas Vegas, NV: December 9, 2019\n\n\u201cI was a budtender before I worked at Leafly, and I know a thousand questions come your way when helping customers select the right products.
