Do we say yes to inequity? Do we say yes to things that are half done?\u201d she said. \u201cThe offer on the table right now effectively provides class size protections for only one-third of the entire city.\u201d\n\nChief Education Officer LaTanya McDade said one of the issues keeping the sides from reaching a deal was providing teachers with paid time to prepare, which the district opposes, saying it would require reduced instructional time.\n\n\u201cThe truth is we have made quite a bit of compromise at the table and we also need the union to make compromises,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the overall progress toward a deal remained stalled on Monday, Chicago Public Schools reached a tentative deal with SEIU Local 73, the union representing school support staff.\n\n\u201cThis is a victory for working people in Chicago and shows what is possible when we unite and take action,\u201d SEIU Local 73 President Dian Palmer said. \u201cThe lowest-paid support workers who are the backbone of our schools are going to see raises that mean their families won\u2019t have to struggle living in an expensive city where costs keep going up.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 28 (UPI) \u2014 The Chicago teachers strike will extend into a ninth school day after the school district and the union failed to reach a deal on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
