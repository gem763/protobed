Right and left: Models showcase the green Beanpole collection from the casual brand\u2019s 2019 fall and winter collection. [PARTSPARTS, SAMSUNG C&T]\n\n[ULKIN]\n\nPARTsPARTs is a women\u2019s high-end fashion brand built on the concept of zero waste. The collection is made with neoprene and with the intention of not producing any excess in the manufacturing process.According to Im Seon-oc, the brand\u2019s creative designer, she hopes to make clothes people can wear every day, just like an \u201cundershirt sold at Dongdaemun.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re living in a world where demand and supply overflow,\u201d said Im at a sustainable session held at Dongdaemun Design Plaza, central Seoul, during Seoul Fashion Week last week. \u201cThat explains why modern consumption patterns have made fashion and the environment inseparable.\u201dAccording to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, fashion may be the world\u2019s second most polluting industry, after oil. Boston-based McKinsey says nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within a few years of being made. In the same report, the consultancy argues washing and drying 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of clothing over its entire life cycle creates 11 kilograms of greenhouse gases. The global consumption of fiber materials hit 11.4 kilograms per capita as of 2016, according to a report from Lausanne, Switzerland-based Quantis, an environmental sustainability consulting group.With fast fashion identified as a major cause of pollution, it has become essential for labels to evaluate the environmental costs of their businesses. A growing number of brands are developing strategies to design, manufacture and distribute clothes in eco-friendly ways.This way of making clothes creates additional challenges.\u201cUsing a single material to design clothes could limit a designer\u2019s ability to follow the trend,\u201d said Im. \u201cIt\u2019s also tough to make seasonal clothes with just a single material. We take on the challenges by adding layers over layers to make winter clothes and embedding eye-catching designs to make them look less dull. Though challenging, there are solutions.\u201dIm added, \u201cWe can\u2019t encourage consumers to buy our clothes just because they are made with good intentions. Sustainable fashion brands first need to make consumers choose us for the design, and then help them realize that the clothes are made in a sustainable method, not the other way around.\u201dThe effort to go sustainable is global, joined by big luxury fashion houses.Chanel in June purchased a minority stake in Evolved by Nature, a green chemistry firm working to replace toxic chemicals and develop sustainable materials, while Prada in May joined other fashion houses, like Mulberry and Gucci, in the fur-free movement. Stockholm-based fast fashion brand H&M started selling second-hand and vintage items in April.\u201cAs consumers become more informed about the damaging impact of fashion on the environment, industry players face increasing pressure to take a stance on ethical issues, such as animal cruelty,\u201d said Nina Marston, Fashion & Beauty analyst at Euromonitor International. This is especially true as young consumers who have risen as the leading consumers have a strong tendency to shop from brands that share their interests and values, according to Marston.Ulkin is a domestic upcycling fashion label that makes bags with the canvas of paintings that were about to be thrown away. By cooperating with lesser-known artists, the brand says it upcycles materials as well and gives the artists exposure. Ulkin uses some of its profits to hold exhibitions featuring the works of the artists.Not Ours is a vegan fashion start-up that makes clothes without the use of animal products, including fur, cashmere and pearls. Instead, it utilizes imitation animal materials, like fake leather.\u201cAs part of the effort to make fashion sustainable, we introduce basic clothes that don\u2019t follow trends so that our consumers can wear them for many years,\u201d said Shin Ha-na, brand marketer for the start-up that launched the service in February last year. Shin, however, admitted to using disposable materials like plastics to make clothes.Vegan Tiger is an eco-friendly fashion brand launched in 2015 with similar intentions.Though not as aggressive, bigger local brands are also joining the effort.Hazzys from LF announced in September that it introduced an \u201cEcoful\u201d lineup targeting women who actively make eco-friendly purchases, like buying electric cars.The primary materials Hazzys uses for the lineup are recycled poly - a man-made fabric produced from PET and polyester fabrics - and micro Tencel, an eco-friendly cotton substitute. The fashion label said it applied eco-friendly production methods, like solvent recycling and the utilization of eco-friendly water repelling agents, to save water and energy as well as reduce the level of carbon dioxide emission.\u201cWith the lineup, we hope to offer diversity in terms of not just colors and designs in our clothes, but also materials for consumers who are increasingly making smarter consumption decisions,\u201d said a spokesperson for LF. \u201cBut our goal with the lineup isn\u2019t to promote our brand as eco-friendly, because that would imply that rest of our clothing is harming the environment.\u201dIn the move to reduce waste, Top 10 in March replaced plastic and vinyl shopping bags with so-called corn bags. Made of corn starch, the bags are biodegradable, disintegrating after a year of being exposed to the sunlight, according to the domestic fast fashion brand.Hyundai Motor also joined the ongoing fashion movement by upcycling leftover leather from car seats and turning it into designer clothes. The automaker in September hosted Re:Style, an upcycling fashion event collection, with New York-based fashion brand Zero + Maria Cornejo.\u201cThe growing influence of social network services has alerted companies of the need to raise transparency of company management and connection with consumers,\u201d said Seo Yong-gu, a professor of business at Sookmyung Women\u2019s University. \u201cThe social recognition has made it difficult for even major firms without a proper social agenda to succeed. How companies grow has become just as important as their performance.\u201dThe environmental recognition is especially notable among younger people.\u201cOn top of millennials, Generation Z\u2019s demand for a company to be operated ethically has become particularly notable,\u201d said a spokesperson for Style Share, a fashion social media start-up that also sells fashion items. \u201cGeneration Z is able to honestly speak out about what\u2019s socially wrong because the online age and the popularity of influencers has shown them that getting employed is not the only way to get a paycheck.\u201dGeneration Z refers to people born after the mid-1990s, while millennials are people born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s.The fashion industry is closely connected with environmental issues in diverse ways, but many fashion companies often simply focus on designing clothes using eco-friendly materials, according to Prof. Park Ju-hee, who teaches fashion design at Kookmin University.\u201cA lot of strong chemicals and water are used in the process of dyeing clothes and in the finishing stage to ensure the colors don\u2019t leave a stain on the buyer\u2019s skin. The polluted water is then discharged into the drain.\u201d Park added, \u201cAlthough we are still in the initial phase, fashion labels have started to realize that eco-friendly is no longer just a trend, but something they are obliged to tackle.\u201dOn top of having released a green Beanpole collection for women\u2019s wear for the fall and winter season, Samsung C&T\u2019s casual fashion brand got rid of the dyeing process for its new bags.Last week, Beanpole introduced to reporters women\u2019s bags that have been made without using water. According to Beanpole, it melts polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compound chips on threads to add colors to the bags without the use of dyes.\u201cGoing eco-friendly has become inevitable in the fashion industry,\u201d said Alex Bang, team leader of Beanpole Accessory. \u201cBut manufacturing items using eco-friendly materials and designs usually costs a lot more since it requires additional manufacturing and time. The problem is whether consumers can accept that increased price.\u201dThe bags are part of the brand\u2019s spring and summer collection.Also important to make fashion sustainable is the consumer awareness.\u201cThe desire to have something exciting and new is always going to be there,\u201d said Michael Ferraro, director of the FIT/Infor DTech Lab, at a Seoul Fashion Week event. \u201cWe need to resist the programming that we are subjected to so we actually make informed decisions about what is good and what we feel is righteous and purposeful. And not respond to an individual marketing message, which is driving their particular point.\u201dBY JIN MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/27210716.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
