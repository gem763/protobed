The stock market has become more volatile over the years, according to a new method for measuring its gyrations, and that\u2019s making life more of a challenge for investors as they attempt to navigate the ups and downs.\n\nIn a Tuesday note, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas highlighted a volatility measure that starts with daily returns on the S&P 500 SPX, -0.08% for any given year and adds them up, but turns the negative days into a positive sign.\n\nNeed to Know: A bear-market catalyst is lying in wait for stocks, warns UBS\n\nThe resulting total absolute daily return mimics what a day trader with 100% knowledge of the next day\u2019s market direction could make by simply going long or short at the previous day\u2019s close, Colas explained, while also offering a measure of what a buy-and-hold investor sees in terms of daily perceived stock market volatility (see chart below).\n\nDataTrek Research\n\nColas and company then did the math for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.08% going back to 1958 and found that absolute daily return volatility has risen steadily over the years. Here\u2019s what he found, broken down by 10-year periods in the table below:\n\nDecade Average absolute daily return volatility 1958-1967 112.3% 1968-1977 154.9% 1978-1987 177.4% 1988-1997 148.4% 1998-2007 207.5% 2008-2017 178.0%\n\nThe annual average for the entire period is 167.6%, with the last decade below that mean being 1988-1997, Colas noted, also emphasizing that 2018\u2019s absolute daily returns totaled 187%, well above the long-run average.\n\n\u201cU.S. equities are becoming structurally more volatile,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAbsolute daily returns capture a unique signal: how much stocks \u2018churn; in a given year. When you look at the data across decades, the upward pattern is clear.\u201d\n\nOpinion: How to take advantage of the January Effect in the U.S. stock market\n\nColas also observed that \u201cbad\u201d single years are showing ever higher levels of volatility, as measured by absolute daily return. Among the examples, 1987 came in at 284%; that was the year of the Oct. 19 crash, but still saw the S&P 500 eke out a 5.8% yearly gain. 2008 \u2014 the worst single year for the S&P 500, with a 36.6% drop, since the 1929 stock market crash \u2014 came in at 440%.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line here: rough years, with or without single-day crashes, are getting tougher,\u201d Colas wrote.\n\nAt the same time, quiet years are more rare. The 1960s saw three years with absolute daily returns of less than 100%. A sub-100% year wasn\u2019t seen again until 1995, when the S&P 500 rose 37.2% for its best annual performance since a 43.7% rise in 1958. After that, it was a 22-year wait for the next such reading in 2017, which saw the S&P 500 rise 21.7%.\n\n\u201c\u2018Easy money\u2019 years are fewer and further apart and the payoffs seem to be lower as well,\u201d Colas said.\n\nWhat about this year? So far, absolute daily returns, under this methodology, for the S&P 500 through Friday totaled 128%, and were on track to end the year around 150% \u2014 pretty close to the average since 2010 of 160% and the long-run mean of 168%, Colas noted. In other words, 2019 isn\u2019t as \u201cquiet\u201d as it\u2019s often made out to be given a reading of the Cboe Volatility Index VIX, +0.69% \u2014 a widely followed measure of expected volatility over a coming 30-day period \u2014 that\u2019s largely stayed below its long-run average of 19. Instead, it\u2019s pretty average.\n\nThe S&P 500, meanwhile, posted a record close on Monday and is up more than 21% for the year to date after taking back a steep fourth-quarter 2018 selloff. The Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, -0.07% is up more than 16% in 2019.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the long-run rise in volatility? Colas said it boils down to \u201ccomplexity.\u201d A more globalized world makes corporate cash-flow streams less predictable, he said, due to increased competition and variations in economic growth across regions. Technological disruption is also playing an increasing role.", "description": "A new measure shows the U.S. stock market becoming \u201cstructurally more volatile\u201d over the last several decades, says DataTrek\u2019s Nicholas Colas.", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU233_dollar_ZG_20191029135611.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
