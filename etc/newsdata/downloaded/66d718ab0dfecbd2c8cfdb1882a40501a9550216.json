EEOC and the women's rights legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "language": "en", "text": "What is a woman? In oral arguments scheduled for today, the Supreme Court soon will consider this question.\n\nIn R.G. and G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC and Stephens, a man named Anthony Stephens, who worked at a funeral home, decided that he is a woman and took the name Aimee. The funeral home\u2019s dress code requires men to wear pants and women to wear skirts; Aimee demanded the right to wear a skirt, but the funeral home did not agree and said things weren\u2019t going to work out. Aimee complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which sued the funeral home, arguing that it engaged in sex discrimination because of Aimee\u2019s \u201cgender identity.\u201d The EEOC and Aimee won.\n\nThe question now before the Supreme Court is whether Congress intended sex to mean \u201cgender identity\u201d when it wrote the Civil Rights Act.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Women\u2019s Liberation Front (WoLF) has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, asking the court to rule definitively that Congress intended for the word \u201csex\u201d to follow the longstanding, traditional meaning of the term \u2014 the biological classification of human beings as either female or male \u2014 when it incorporated it into Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Or, in the words of Merriam Webster, \u201ceither of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male especially on the basis of their reproductive organs and structures.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201csex\u201d does not equate to some vague, ill-defined concept of \u201cgender identity.\u201d Women have been discriminated against for thousands of years because we are biologically women, not because of \u201cidentity.\u201d\n\nWoLF is in this fight this because we care about the rights, privacy and safety of women and girls, as does Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Ruth Bader GinsburgThe Hill's Morning Report - Trump's impeachment woes mount Fallout from Kavanaugh confirmation felt in Washington one year later Ginsburg predicts historians will call this political era an 'aberration' MORE. We hope that she will side with us. Justice Ginsburg long has argued that women deserve justice under the law, on the basis of sex. She knows what a woman is, and it would be difficult to overstate her commitment to advancing the rights of women. There are too many examples to detail here, but to name a few:\n\nIn 1971, Ginsburg worked as a volunteer at the American Civil Liberties Union (the ACLU understood in 1971 what the word \u201cwoman\u201d means). While there, she wrote a brief before the Supreme Court in the case of Reed v. Reed, describing the legally enforced second-class status of women. She argued that a law stating that \u201cmales must be preferred to females,\u201d in appointing administrators of estates, violated the 14th Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. Ginsburg\u2019s 68-page brief included an appendix of state laws that discriminated on the basis of sex. She won, and the court concluded that women are entitled to equal protection.\n\nIn 1972, Ginsburg co-founded the Women\u2019s Rights Project at the ACLU and, in 1973, she became the Project\u2019s general counsel. She argued six sex discrimination cases before the Supreme Court and won five of them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 1973, Ginsburg wrote another brief for the ACLU making similar arguments. Her relentless advocacy on behalf of women ultimately prevailed in the case of Craig v. Boren, where the court ruled that sex discrimination claims would receive \u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d \u2014 a significant legal win. Ginsburg had advised the plaintiffs\u2019 ACLU lawyer in that case and submitted a brief in support.\n\nGinsburg\u2019s advocacy on behalf of women has not been limited to judicial arguments. Between 1972 and 1980, she taught at Columbia University \u2014 the first female tenured faculty member \u2014 and co-authored the nation\u2019s first legal textbook on sex discrimination. She has written dozens of Law Review articles on this topic, and is ferocious in researching how women have been systematically excluded from participation inside and outside of the legal profession. For example, she wrote in 1979 that:\n\n\u201c[W]omen litigated few sex equality claims in the eight decades following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. The brave handful who did were unsuccessful: Myra Bradwell, in 1873, was told she had no federal constitutional right to practice law; Virginia Minor, less than two years later, was told participation in the processes of democratic government through the franchise was properly reserved to men \u2026\u201d\n\nHer statements on this topic aren\u2019t limited to those she made in the 1970s. In 2015, she stated: \u201cI\u2019m sometimes asked when will there be enough [women on the Supreme Court] and I say, \u2018When there are nine\u2019; people are shocked. But there\u2019d been nine men and nobody\u2019s ever raised a question about that.\u201d\n\nSome are concerned that if our society achieves true equality of the sexes, we will be unable to enforce sex-based segregation when there is legitimate reason to do so. But that is simply not true \u2014 justice does not require denying the reality of biological sex. This is precisely what Ginsburg meant when she stated, in 1975: \u201cSeparate places to disrobe, sleep, perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual privacy. Individual privacy, a right of constitutional dimension, is appropriately harmonized with the equality principle.\u201d\n\nIt is well known that Ginsburg replaced the word \u201csex\u201d with the word \u201cgender\u201d in her advocacy because she was concerned that using \u201csex\u201d would make the justices squeamish. But there is no reason to believe that by doing so she intended to create a third sex class, or to advance the notion that men can be women.\n\nIn the current case, Stephens could have simply challenged the sex-specific dress code, but instead is attempting to redefine the fundamental meaning of the term \u201csex\u201d under federal civil rights law.\n\n\u201cGender identity\u201d is an enshrinement of the sex-based stereotypes that Ginsburg has been fighting for decades. \u201cSex\u201d means biological sex, not \u201cgender identity.\u201d We look forward to a Supreme Court ruling that settles the question.\n\nKara Dansky serves on the board of the Women\u2019s Liberation Front (WoLF), a radical feminist organization that sued the Obama administration to restore Title IX rights to women and girls.
