The walls, they're filled with bullet holes,\" said taxi driver Jose Manuel Uriarte, whose home is located just below the hill where he said gunmen had taken up positions to fire upon the military vehicles.\n\nHe pointed out, with fingers stained with paint from the repairs he had started, where his mattress had been covered by a blanket of broken glass.\n\nAn avocado tree in the lush garden outside his bedroom had been split open by the gunfire and Uriarte estimated that he had already found around 500 bullet casings nearby.\n\nHe spotted another on the ground, squatted down to pick it up and then handed it over like it was a souvenir.\n\nLike other locals, he wonders about the possible infiltration of the cartel into local and state police, but said there is no doubt that the cartel proved itself to be the stronger force, at least for one violent afternoon last week.\n\nAnd then his face turned angry and he pursed his lips.\n\n\"It's infuriating,\" he said, \"because you have to ask yourself, 'Who's really in charge?'\"\n\n(Reporting by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)", "description": "The trendy bars and restaurants along the main strip of the Mexican city overwhelmed late last week by an army of cartel gunmen slowly began their recovery over the weekend even as many traumatized residents still shied away.
