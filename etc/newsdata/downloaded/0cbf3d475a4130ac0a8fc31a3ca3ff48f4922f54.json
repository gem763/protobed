The Russian leader had used the call to complain about the humanitarian situation on the Turkish-Syrian border and had stressed the need to avoid a clash between Turkish and Syrian forces, it said.\n\nPutin had told Erdogan that the situation whereby Islamic State prisoners being held in custody by Syrian Kurds were exploiting the chaos by trying to escape was unacceptable, the Kremlin said.\n\nPutin had also invited Erdogan to visit Russia in the coming days for urgent talks, a proposal Ankara had accepted, it added.\n\nLavrentiev, Putin's Syria envoy, earlier on Tuesday told Russian news agencies that Moscow had always considered any kind of Turkish military operation on Syrian territory unacceptable.\n\nHis comments, which suggest growing tensions between Turkey and Russia, came a day after the Kremlin complained that Turkey's incursion was \"not exactly\" compatible with Syrian territorial integrity.\n\n\"The security of the Turkish-Syrian border must be ensured by the deployment of Syrian government troops along its entire length,\" said Lavrentiev. \"That's why we never spoke in favour or supported the idea of Turkish units (being deployed there) let alone the armed Syrian opposition.\"\n\nLavrentiev said Turkey's actions risked upsetting delicate religious sensitivities in northern Syria.\n\nIn particular, he said the area was populated by Kurds, Arabs and Sunnis who would not take kindly to their lands being resettled by people who had never lived there, a reference to Turkey's plan to house refugees from other parts of Syria there.\n\nLavrentiev confirmed that Russia had brokered an agreement between the Syrian government and Kurdish forces that saw the Kurds cede control of territory to Syrian troops.\n\nThose talks had taken place at Russia's Hmeimim air base in Syria among other places, he said.\n\nRussia's influence in Syria and the Middle East is widely seen to have been boosted in the last week thanks to Washington scaling back its Syria operation and the Syrian Kurds striking a deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Moscow's closest ally in the region.\n\nLavrentiev said Moscow was hoping that the United States would withdraw all of its forces from Syria. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke to his U.S. counterpart about Syria on Tuesday evening.\n\nRussian military police are patrolling the line of contact between Syrian and Turkish government troops.\n\nLavrentiev estimated there were around 12,000 Islamic State prisoners being held in northeast Syria.
