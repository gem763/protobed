Trump could be impeached for that.", "language": "en", "text": "For congressional Democrats considering impeachment, there is a case to be made that the Constitution\u2019s reference to \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors\u201d applies to Trump\u2019s alleged Ukraine plot, charges of a coverup or possible obstruction of justice. And there would be nothing unusual about Congress considering several articles of impeachment: The House voted on four articles against President Bill Clinton \u2014 obstruction passed, abuse of power failed \u2014 and 11 against President Andrew Johnson. The Senate ultimately voted on two articles against Clinton and three against Johnson.\n\nAmid a series of House investigations, however, and several public, potentially incriminating admissions by Trump, Democrats haven\u2019t settled on a core legal rationale for impeachment, which is striking, considering the Constitution\u2019s answer is staring them in the face. Trump\u2019s statements and actions with regard to Ukraine appear to fit one of the few offenses the Constitution specifically lists as impeachable:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBribery.\n\nAlong with treason, it\u2019s the only impeachable offense expressly listed in Article II, Section 4 before the catchall category, \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors,\u201d as a reason to impeach federal officials, who \u201cshall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nThe legal case would be that Trump offered a bribe. He encouraged Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cto do us a favor\u201d and look into, among other things, the Biden family. Trump would later acknowledge that goal, telling reporters on Oct. 3 that he wanted Zelensky to \u201cstart a major investigation into the Bidens.\u201d Evidence and testimony from inside the Trump administration, meanwhile, suggests that the sought after benefit \u2014 an investigation of Trump\u2019s rival \u2014 was conditioned on U.S. government action: Administration officials have referenced apparent conditions on both a coveted White House meeting between the two leaders, and on disbursement of millions in military aid, pending Ukraine\u2019s government announcing an investigation of the Bidens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven though the process would likely call for additional evidence and detail, that\u2019s the logical thrust of the argument that Trump offered a bribe: corruptly soliciting something of value \u201cin exchange for official action.\u201d As it stands, the case appears straightforward, and, unlike most legal or political issues, several key underlying facts aren\u2019t even in dispute.\n\nA focus on bribery would distinguish this case from the two presidential impeachments in history, neither of which resulted in conviction in the Senate and removal from office. The Johnson and Clinton cases were bogged down by a difficult question: What defines a high crime or misdemeanor in the Constitution?\n\nAt Johnson\u2019s trial, the Senate was not convinced by articles of impeachment that fixated on whether he made an illegal recess appointment for the war secretary position, or whether he brought a generalized sense of \u201cridicule and disgrace\u201d to the presidency, a matter of opinion. For Clinton, even some of his Republican opponents were not convinced a president should be convicted of a \u201chigh crime\u201d for alleged perjury and obstruction that did not involve official duties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy contrast, no one can deny that bribery is impeachable, because the Constitution says it is.\n\nInvoking the Founders\u2019 text also preempts efforts to turn impeachment into a technical debate over federal law. A Senate trial on bribery would evaluate impeachment the way the Constitution does: As a violation so grave it merits removal, without parsing the statutes that Congress passed decades after the Constitution was ratified. As former Justice Department lawyer Ben Berwick argues, \u201cthe concept of high crimes and misdemeanors can\u2019t be limited by statutes\u201d since, until the mid-20th century, criminal law \u201cfollowed the common law model\u201d and the \u201csame goes for bribery,\u201d since \u201cthere was no general federal bribery statute at all until 1853.\u201d There\u2019s not much logic, then, to invoking contemporary laws to resolve whether the president\u2019s conduct is impeachable, when the conduct fits within an impeachable offense already spelled out in the Constitution\u2019s text.\n\nIf the president or other officials separately committed a felony, that is a matter for prosecutors. The outlook there is mixed. On the one hand, the Supreme Court recently raised the bar for what it takes to convict a public official for bribery, in a unanimous ruling knocking down the conviction of former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell. Remember the \u201cofficial act\u201d required in return for a bribe? The Court ruled it must involve deploying \u201cgovernmental power,\u201d not just setting up a meeting. That could be good news for any official who may have arranged Ukraine meetings, but it probably doesn\u2019t help an official who may have corruptly altered foreign aid. On the other hand, when a plot involves a United States official demanding a benefit, strict bribery and extortion rules can kick in. Public officials can be found guilty of federal bribery or extortion even without fulfilling a promised quid pro quo. As the Court stressed in that same case, an official can commit bribery even if he does not actually take an action, \u201cit is enough that the official agree to do so.\u201d In other words, demanding something of value while merely suggesting you will take future government action, such as delaying military aid, might constitute a crime, even if you don\u2019t follow through.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is a range of evidence against President Trump, including what is known in legal circles as his \u201cvoluntary confession,\u201d but he has more than one defense: On his conduct toward Ukraine, Trump argues that regardless of what he requested or hoped for, he didn\u2019t offer any explicit action in exchange for an investigation. \u201cWhen this came out, it was \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 \u2014 well, there is none,\u201d Trump told reporters on earlier this month. Thursday, in the White House press briefing room, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney conceded that military aid for Ukraine was conditioned on a political probe, saying \u201cthat\u2019s why we held up the money\u201d \u2014 an admission so blunt that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer rushed to distance himself from the statement. Ultimately, though, the Constitution\u2019s bribery prohibition doesn\u2019t turn exclusively on whether officials say the conduct occurred, but rather on Congress\u2019s view of what the evidence proves.\n\nWhile that argument is about what Trump offered, there is another defense based on what he sought: Trump may argue that whatever personal benefit might accrue from a Biden investigation, he genuinely thought an investigation was in the interest of the country. Trump took this tack on Oct. 4, arguing that he had \u201ca duty\u201d to push a foreign investigation of Biden because \u201cwe are looking for corruption.\u201d Legitimately demanding something for the United States does not amount to a benefit for a bribe, which makes his intent the issue.\n\nAnd there are also institutional defenses: Whatever one thinks of this alleged plot, there\u2019s a question of whether the Senate should set a precedent for indicting, and potentially ousting a president over what some consider only diplomatic \u201chardball.\u201d Throughout history, the argument goes, presidents have wielded foreign policy powers with an eye on reelection \u2014 perhaps that\u2019s what Mulvaney was trying to get at with his now infamous comments in the briefing room, declaring \u201cwe do that all the time\u201d and telling everyone to \u201cget over it\".\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost of these defenses turn on credibility. Are they corroborated, or undercut, by firsthand witnesses, the administration\u2019s actions, and the evidence of Trump\u2019s intent? In the end, there may be many things about the president that merit criticism, but few that merit impeachment. That is what the Founders intended when they listed only bribery, treason, and high crimes and misdemeanors as grounds for taking that step.\n\nIf Congress, pursuing impeachment, begins with the Constitution\u2019s text, it may find bribery is the right place to focus. That\u2019s true especially because of evidence drawn from Trump\u2019s own words: Remarkably, the president who spent years successfully resisting an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller finds an impeachment probe rapidly escalating, in part, because of interviews he\u2019s given, freely, sometimes standing on the White House lawn.\n\nAD", "description": "Why wrestle with the meaning of \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors\u201d?
