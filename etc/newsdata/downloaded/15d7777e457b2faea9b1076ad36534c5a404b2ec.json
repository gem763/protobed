It first appeared on scmp.com on Aug. 27, 2019.\n\nMost of the young people who on Monday spoke with Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in a landmark dialogue session had taken part in anti-government marches, organizers of the meeting have told the Post.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGovernment officials stuck to its plan to meet first with moderate young protesters before reaching out to more vocal and radical activists, a source familiar with plans to start a citywide dialogue platform said on Tuesday. Several leaders of the youth groups who organized the Monday meeting said they were open to similar events to allow senior government officials more opportunities to exchange ideas with young protesters.\n\nThe youth groups involved included the Outstanding Young Persons\u2019 Association, the Hong Kong Playground Associations and the Junior Chamber International Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the idea late last week and government officials were interested in such an arrangement,\u201d said Dr. Eugene Chan Kin-keung, vice-chairman of the Outstanding Young Persons\u2019 Association.\n\nThe Post was told that at least one well-established youth group withdrew from the initiative after discussions started.\n\nLam on Monday afternoon held a closed-door meeting with about 20 protesters, most of whom were in their 20s and 30s. She was accompanied by Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung and Secretary for Home Affairs Lau Kong-wah.\n\nChen Lin, director general of the youth department of Beijing\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, also attended the meeting. The three youth groups said they invited young people from various backgrounds to attend the meeting.\n\nEdward Leung Wai-kuen, executive director of the Hong Kong Playground Associations, said the government expressed a desire to speak directly with young people who had taken part in protest marches, including rallies against the now-shelved extradition bill.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing political crisis can\u2019t be resolved simply by suppression,\u201d Leung said. \"It\u2019s good that the government is willing to understand the views of young people.\u201d\n\nCasper Wong Chun-long, the deputy chairman of centrist group Third Side, who attended the meeting with Lam, said he joined the marches in June but he disagreed with the violent protests that had shocked the city in recent weeks.\n\nSince June, Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government by protests sparked by an unpopular government bill that would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to mainland China another jurisdictions. In the weeks that followed, protesters settled on five main demands, including the formal withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry into the actions of police.\n\nLam last week again rejected the protesters\u2019 top demands, but offered to create the platform for dialogue.\n\n\u201cIt is not a question of not responding, it is a question of not accepting those demands,\u201d Lam said on Tuesday before meeting her Executive Council. She said the outbreak of violence and radical tactics made it inappropriate for the government to accommodate the protesters\u2019 demands.\n\n\u201cThe government should take smaller steps, such as withdrawing the bill first and launching an independent inquiry,\u201d Wong said. \u201cProtesters should give the government some room by not insisting that the government meet all their demands.\u201d\n\nThe source familiar with the dialogue plan agreed the government should meet certain demands \u2014 like launching an independent inquiry \u2014 to help jump-start the dialogue process.\n\nOn Monday, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said the government had studied the French government\u2019s response to \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests. The protests began in November to oppose fuel tax increases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough for the government to draw references from the form, but not the substance, of other countries\u2019 experience in handling political crisis,\u201d the source said.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron launched a two-month consultation that included holding 10,000 town hall meetings across France.\n\n\u201cMacron launched the nationwide dialogue after withdrawing the fuel-tax hikes. It would be very difficult for the dialogue in Hong Kong to bear fruit if the government refuses to meet any of protesters\u2019 demands,\u201d the source said.", "description": "Government officials stuck to its plan to meet first with moderate young protesters before reaching out to more vocal and radical activists.", "authors": ["Gary Cheung", "South China Morning Post"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e8/b3/4df4c0f4439bb7e4ddf7b3223faa/190827-carrie-lam-gty-773.jpg"}
