Now, he\u2019s the last one remaining.\n\nThe sudden departure on Tuesday of John Bolton as the president\u2019s national security adviser\u2014a strong personality and unique character even by Trumpian standards\u2014removed one of the last dissenting voices in the West Wing. It also immediately empowered Mr. Pompeo, already one of the longest-tenured and most trusted foreign-policy advisers in the current White House.\n\nWhether he remains is an open question, given such key Republicans as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) have urged him to run for an open Kansas Senate seat, while others are suggesting that now may not be the time to leave.\n\nFor now at least, the shift within the administration highlights how Mr. Pompeo remains one of the few senior Trump officials who has maintained strong relationships with the traditional wing of the Republican Party while earning support from the new brand of \u201cAmerica First\u201d conservatives that the president has brought into the party, according to Republican officials and Trump allies.\n\nHe has also maintained his own personal political base, organizing monthly dinners around Washington with disparate political factions, including groups of farmers, Republican operatives and strategists, business executives, donors and preachers. Mr. Pompeo has organized similar dinners dating back to his time as a U.S. House lawmaker.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s departure also emboldens Mr. Pompeo to shoulder some of Mr. Trump\u2019s most ambitious and unconventional objectives, including meeting with Iran\u2019s leader with no preconditions and bringing Taliban leaders to Camp David for peace talks.\n\nMr. Pompeo backed recent efforts by Mr. Trump\u2019s envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, to broker a deal, and he \u201cdidn\u2019t oppose\u201d talks with the Taliban, people familiar with the matter said. The breaking point for Mr. Bolton\u2019s association with Mr. Trump came in a dispute over the president\u2019s interest in speaking directly to the Taliban.`\n\n\u201cThese have been the president\u2019s policies,\u201d Mr. Pompeo told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think any leader around the world should make any assumption that because some one of us departs, that President Trump\u2019s foreign policy will change in a material way.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo and his expanding foreign policy portfolio will be in the spotlight as world leaders converge on New York later this month for the United Nations General Assembly, where the president potentially could meet with his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani. Mr. Pompeo said Tuesday that such a meeting was possible.\n\nAnother concern is the continuing dispute between U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, and the looming end of a military information-sharing agreement between them.\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s role in denuclearizing North Korea may also face new scrutiny. Pyongyang frequently complained that Mr. Bolton\u2014who had proposed using military force to oust current rulers\u2014was a part of Mr. Trump\u2019s team. Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure removes that talking point for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his team.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s involvement with North Korea was Mr. Trump\u2019s first complaint about his former national security adviser when speaking to reporters on Wednesday. The president said it was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and among Mr. Bolton\u2019s biggest mistakes to publicly say last year that the administration was considering a \u201cLibya model\u201d for quick disarmament in North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea immediately denounced the comparison as insulting and \u201csinister.\u201d The fact that Moammar Gadhafi, Libya\u2019s strongman, was overthrown and killed by rebels in 2011 made the comparison objectionable to Pyongyang.\n\nAt the time, Kim Kye Gwan, North Korea\u2019s first vice minister for foreign affairs, referred to the regime\u2019s previous statements about Mr. Bolton, which referred to him as a bloodsucker and human scum, while noting, \u201cWe do not hide our feeling of repugnance toward him.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he didn\u2019t blame North Korea for what its leaders said about Mr. Bolton. \u201cWe were set back very badly when John Bolton talked about the Libyan model,\u201d the president said.\n\nThe expanding role for Mr. Pompeo continues a familiar path for those around the West Wing, where he has leaned on his own political skills to maintain and deepen his relationship with Mr. Trump.\n\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio), who appointed Mr. Pompeo to the prestigious House intelligence committee as a freshman representative in 2011, said that the Kansan\u2019s chief political skill was that he was from the Midwest.\n\n\u201cPeople from the Midwest are nice, and that\u2019s the first step in this process,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. \u201cAnd people respect him: He doesn\u2019t play games with people, or mince words. He\u2019s a bit cautious, but smart about what he says and smart about what he doesn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo, the president\u2019s first director of the Central Intelligence Agency, continues to be involved in the Mr. Trump\u2019s intelligence briefings, according to people familiar with the briefings, an unusual situation for a sitting secretary of state.\n\nAt the CIA, he straddled the line between the agency\u2019s analysts and spies and a president who frequently criticized the intelligence community. Early on, when CIA analysts would complain about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, Mr. Pompeo would remind them that the president consistently gave the agency the resources it requested, according to people familiar with his tenure there.\n\nSimilarly, he provided an initial boost to morale at the State Department. At his swearing-in ceremony in May 2018, he vowed to bring back the State Department\u2019s swagger. He lifted the hiring freeze imposed by his predecessor and regularly held \u201cMeet With Mike\u201d sessions at embassies to receive bottom-up feedback from staff.\n\nMore recently, he was considered by several in the administration to be the de facto defense secretary during a recent period of transition. In June, with the Pentagon still under acting leadership, Mr. Pompeo flew to Tampa, Fla., for meetings with the leadership of U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command, which are under the purview of the Defense Department. Mr. Pompeo said his visit was intended to ensure coordination between the departments of State and Defense, but his Pentagon counterpart wasn\u2019t present.\n\nUntil Mr. Bolton\u2019s replacement is named, he is likely to pick up duties that would normally fall to the national security adviser, according to administration officials and people close to Mr. Pompeo. Only one man in U.S. history, Henry Kissinger, has formally held both titles.\n\nThe moment also created an inflection point for Mr. Pompeo, who is being pushed by some Senate Republicans to run for the U.S. Senate seat in Kansas.\n\nThat option would provide an exit ramp from the Trump administration amid public polls that raise questions about whether the president will win a second term. Seven of 10 Kansas Republican primary voters hold favorable views of Mr. Pompeo, well above other contenders for the seat, according to a poll conducted June 3-6 by the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group.\n\nJosh Holmes, Mr. McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff, said Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda for a potential second term could depend on holding the Kansas Senate seat. \u201cMike Pompeo can solve that problem instantaneously,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Mr. Pompeo is now getting pressure from other Senate Republicans and Trump allies to forgo that campaign and stay by Mr. Trump\u2019s side as the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy continues to be challenged from China to Iran to Venezuela.\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.) said that Mr. Pompeo \u201cought to stay where he is\u201d at the State Department.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the last well-informed individuals, kind of the old school,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d prefer that he stay.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has said he plans to name a replacement for Mr. Bolton next week, but Mr. Inhofe said the process may take longer. In the interim, he expects the president to lean even more on Mr. Pompeo.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, we have to run this,\u201d he said. Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Inhofe said, \u201cis the most logical person to have that continuity to do it. But let\u2019s wait and see what the president\u2019s decision is.\u201d\n\nCharles Kupchan, a senior National Security Council staffer in the Clinton and Obama administrations, said Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure strengthens Mr. Pompeo\u2019s position, as it removes a key rival for influence.\n\n\u201cPompeo now has no one in the White House who is an influential figure, a cabinet-level figure, that can stand up to him or go around him,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said.\n\n\u2014Lindsay Wise, Jessica Donati and Vivian Salama contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Michael C.
