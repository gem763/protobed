He expects better ball movement. And it all starts with more communication.\n\nMiller believes improving those areas will finally produce consistently better results and could help Indiana return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2016.\n\n\u201cI definitely think our team understands from a staff perspective that there is a lot of pressure on us as a group of people to really come together,\u201d Miller said Wednesday at Indiana\u2019s annual media day. \u201cTo do that, I think definitely requires more talking, more communicating and more situations where we\u2019re forcing them to be sort of the driving force behind that.\u201d\n\nIt appears Miller has the program heading in the right direction despite concerns from impatient fans.\n\nAfter missing the postseason in Tom Crean\u2019s final season in Bloomington and again in Miller\u2019s first season with the Hoosiers, Indiana reached the NIT quarterfinals in March.\n\nTaking that next step in Miller\u2019s third season means Indiana must figure out how to replace its top two scorers - Romeo Langford, who left after one season for the NBA, and Juwan Morgan, who graduated. Miller knows it won\u2019t be easy to replace 32 points per game, nearly half the team\u2019s scoring average.\n\nSo Miller is working on intangibles first, hoping that will provide a solid foundation on which to grow.\n\n\u201cYou know the setting with young people these days, they very literally don\u2019t talk as much as they used to,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we try to put our guys in situations where it forces them to communicate, be more active with one another. I think the one thing that\u2019s unique, as you get older, is you have more familiarity with each other, you have more closeness.\u201d\n\nAnd two years in the system should help with continuity, too.\n\nBut Miller also needs highly touted in-state recruits Trayce Jackson-Davis and Armaan Franklin to fill the voids left by Morgan and Langford, and Miller thinks redshirt freshman Jerome Hunter also can make a difference after missing all of last season following surgery on his leg.\n\nIndiana announced Tuesday that Hunter is participating in all basketball-related activities and Miller told reporters Hunter has been making steady progress over the last five weeks.\n\nPlus, the Hoosiers found a new veteran voice in the locker room: 6-foot-11, 245-pound graduate transfer Joey Brunk who spent the last three seasons at Butler.\n\n\u201cWe do have a group of guys that, naturally, are kind of quiet natured. I think that\u2019s where Joey has been a great boost,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHis personality has really helped our workouts, our locker room. The younger guys who have a year under their belt have changed. Robert (Phinisee) has done a really nice job in our workouts. He\u2019s taken a concerted effort to communicate better, talk better, not be quiet.\u201d\n\nBut Miller isn\u2019t just talking a good game; he\u2019s trying to find answers on the court, too.\n\nEven with Langford and Morgan last season, the Hoosiers struggled mightily from 3-point range.\n\nThe solution might be better movement in the offense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be much more difficult to deal with, which means the offense has to have a lot more randomness in what we do,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe have to utilize our versatility with the guys that can play multiple positions together. And we are going to have to move that ball. To do that, you\u2019re going to have a lot of concepts and action to the way you play.\u201d\n\nWill the new approach change the bottom line?\n\nMiller thinks it will.\n\n\u201cThis team is built a little bit differently,\u201d Miller said. \u201cOur versatility is more inside out than it is outside in. I do think we have some guys that are going to have to stretch the floor for us to be effective, and that starts with our backcourt. Our perimeter guys have to shoot it in, and we\u2019ll have to find some other guys that can fill that niche.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coach Archie Miller expects the Indiana Hoosiers to look and play differently this season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/indiana-media_day_basketball_13834_c0-160-3823-2389_s1770x1032.jpg?e179130a4223a4c5420b495e7ef6833ee1ea6c63", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
