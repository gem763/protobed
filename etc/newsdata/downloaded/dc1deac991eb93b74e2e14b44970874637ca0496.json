Joe Walsh, who is mounting a long-shot primary bid against President Trump, on Monday called the Republican Party a \u201ccult\u201d and decried recent moves from some state parties to eliminate or curtail their presidential nominating contests next year.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Russia. I do not live in Russia. I refuse to live in Russia,\u201d Mr. Walsh said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t just cancel elections in this country.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump continues to enjoy overwhelming support among Republicans, but Mr. Walsh claimed that the support is \u201csoft\u201d and that people want an alternative.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ve given up on the Republican Party. The Republican Party is a cult, right? They no longer stand for ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Republican Party right now is all about washing their leader\u2019s feet every day \u2014 that\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take our campaign directly to Republican voters, and I\u2019ll add: in all 50 states. We\u2019re going to campaign in all 50 states,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican parties in states such as South Carolina, Nevada, Kansas and Arizona have recently moved to cancel or curtail their 2020 nominating contests with Mr. Trump up for reelection.\n\nBoth parties have done similar things in the past when they have an incumbent president running for reelection, under the rationale that the money saved on a primary that the incumbent is overwhelmingly likely to win anyway could be better spent elsewhere.\n\nMr. Walsh, along with fellow GOP primary challengers former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Rep. Mark Sanford, wrote a piece for The Washington Post last week decrying the moves from the state parties.\n\nThe president has labeled the candidates the \u201cThree Stooges.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
