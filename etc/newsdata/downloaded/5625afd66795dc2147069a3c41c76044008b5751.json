He has been hailed as a hero in some American conservative circles.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5826992125001\n\n\u2018I beg the Lord\u2019s forgiveness\u2019 for child abuse \u2018betrayal\u2019 says Pope Francis at a service in Knock, Ireland\n\nIt has been no secret that Pope Francis, the first Latin American pope, has a complicated view of his former neighbours to the north, and that the American conservatives have long been out of his good graces.\n\nHe has been a committed critic of the abuses of American capitalism.\n\nNot long after his election, Vatican ambassadors briefed the pontiff about various situations around the world and suggested that he be especially careful when appointing bishops and cardinals in the United States.\n\n\u201cI know that already,\u201d the pope interrupted, a high-ranking Vatican official told the Times in 2017. \u201cThat\u2019s where the opposition is coming from.\u201d\n\nThat year, two close associates of Pope Francis, in an article published in a Vatican-vetted magazine, accused American Catholic ultraconservatives of making an unholy alliance of \u201chate\u201d with evangelical Christians to help Donald Trump.", "description": "In an offhand remark on the papal plane en route to Mozambique, Pope Francis acknowledged the sharp opposition he has faced from conservative Catholic detractors in the United States, calling it an \u201can honour that the Americans attack me\u201d.His remark came at the start of a six-day trip to Africa, as the", "authors": ["Jason Horowitz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Rr6GADJW2G6kB1RMB_TSrw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/13146a2f2c62aa1dbb017bc4f0d25753", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
