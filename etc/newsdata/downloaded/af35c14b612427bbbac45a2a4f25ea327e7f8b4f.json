Refinitiv data showed that 55% of Asian firms missed their consensus earnings\u2019 estimates in the April-June quarter.\n\nHowever, Asian shares are up this month on hopes the talks between the United States and China early in October would help de-escalate their trade dispute, bringing some relief to regional economies.\n\n\u201cThe sustainability of the rosier mood remains a question that could keep investors cautious into year-end,\u201d said IG\u2019s Pan.\n\n\u201cDespite the rosier valuations, the uncertainty across the range of geopolitical issues continues to suggest that there may be greater volatility ahead.\u201d\n\nAsian companies Q2 earnings miss here", "description": "Foreigners turned net sellers of Asian equities in August as sentiment worsened with the United States and China, after a brief truce, announcing new tariffs on each other.", "authors": ["Patturaja", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
