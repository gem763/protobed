Max Rose of New York and Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, saw their newfound support for an impeachment inquiry met mostly with applause. Both are the type of moderates that Republicans have sworn would pay a steep political price for backing impeachment.\n\nTheir warm receptions show how rapidly the perceived politics of an impeachment inquiry are changing. Though Democrats long feared impeaching the president would gin up Trump\u2019s fiercely conservative base voters and overshadow the party\u2019s focus on health care and the economy, tightly crafted to appeal to swing voters. Instead, many Democratic operatives are increasingly seeing an impeachment inquiry as politically neutral.\n\nFor instance, Priorities USA \u2015 the largest Democratic super-PAC and a longtime advocate of the idea Democrats should remain focused on economic issues \u2015 released polling this week aimed at showing \u201cmajor warning signs for the GOP\u201d on impeachment. The poll, conducted by Civis Analytics, found 45% of likely 2020 voters support impeachment, while 40% oppose it. (The poll is broadly in line with other recent public polling, though.)\n\nAndrew Kelly / Reuters Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) meets the press following a town hall where he announced his support for an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nRose, a military veteran and proud member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, unseated Republican Rep. Dan Donovan in November in a district that Trump won by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016. Until Wednesday evening, he had been one of just 11 House Democrats resisting coming out in favor of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSpeaking to over 100 constituents at the Jewish Community Center of Staten Island on Wednesday, however, Rose revealed that Trump administration officials\u2019 obstructionist attitude toward investigations of alleged misconduct had pushed him over the edge.\n\n\u201cInstead of allaying our concerns, the president and his administration have poured gasoline on the fire. The American people have a right to know if their president used the power of his or her office to get a foreign power to interfere in our elections,\u201d he said, eliciting applause from the audience.\n\nOn its face, Rose\u2019s decision to embrace the impeachment inquiry in a district where Trump won by a larger margin than he did carries clear risk.\n\nBut Rose was facing Republican attacks for effectively supporting impeachment even before he had staked out a stance on the matter.\n\nThe Republican National Committee already began blasting him at the end of September as part of a $2 million ad campaign targeting Rose and other vulnerable House Democrats.\n\n\u201cInstead of working to create more jobs, Rose wants more hearings,\u201d the narrator of the RNC ad says as images of more liberal Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, appear on-screen.\n\nThis is just the beginning of an all-out fight to defend our democracy & our president.\n\n\n\nDozens of House Dems campaigned on working with @realDonaldTrump, yet fell in line with Pelosi & the Squad.\n\n\n\nVoters don't support this impeachment charade & it\u2019s going to backfire come 2020! pic.twitter.com/fcb9Uvfvca \u2014 Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) September 27, 2019\n\nNicole Malliotakis, the Republican New York Assemblywoman who has launched a bid to unseat Rose, nonetheless showcased how attacks against him could intensify now.\n\nRose, she tweeted, \u201ctonight announced that he caved to Pelosi, AOC & socialist squad after saying he didn\u2019t support impeachment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the town hall, Rose, employing the sort of bravado native to his corner of New York, insisted that the attacks from Malliotakis and other Republicans did not frighten him.\n\n\u201cI am not concerned at all by [House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm] or anyone that wants to try and challenge me because they already tried once, and we kicked their ass,\u201d he boasted, referring to his 2018 victory. \u201cAnd guess what: That\u2019s exactly what is going to happen again. They have been absolute jokes. They will continue to be jokes. And I look forward to beating them by an incredible margin.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Rose went out of his way during the town hall to distance himself from Ocasio-Cortez and other left-leaning Democrats whom Republicans have turned into a political cudgel against moderates like Rose.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, we have Democrats who, before they have sworn the oath of office, want to impeach the president of the United States,\u201d he said, making what appeared to be a veiled reference to comments by Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, a member of the group of progressive congresswomen known as \u201cthe Squad.\u201d \u201cOn the other side, though, we have Republicans who swore the same oath that I did, but suddenly they become deaf, mute and blind whenever allegations against the president come up. That\u2019s an even greater threat to our democracy.\u201d\n\n(Wild, similarly, used a voter\u2019s question to note she had worked to be a \u201csounding board and educator\u201d after Omar and Tlaib made comments some considered anti-Semitic.)\n\nOn the campus of Muhlenberg College, Wild faced questions about improving public education, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and climate change before a voter asked why she was more focused on impeachment than on improving schools in the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think that those of us in Washington are spending all of our time on impeachment,\u201d she told the crowd of roughly 250 people.\n\nThe audience at the event was mostly on the side of Wild, who won her seat in this manufacturing-heavy area by 10 percentage points in 2018. Questioners who pressed her on impeachment were met with boos, while a voter who suggested House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff jail uncooperative Trump officials received applause. Before the event, Wild told reporters that phone calls to her office were running 85% in favor of impeachment or an impeachment inquiry.\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images Rep. Susan Wild talks with constituents following a town hall meeting at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The crowd was largely supportive of her decision to back an impeachment inquiry.\n\nWild, who had opposed an impeachment inquiry until revelations about Trump pressuring Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to reopen an investigation into Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, said she felt \u201cthe administration left us no choice\u201d but to back impeachment. And, she said, voters were behind them.\n\n\u201cI think the issue of the Ukraine phone call is sufficiently troubling. And we\u2019ve seen what the polls have done this week,\u201d she told reporters, later adding that she wanted to keep the inquiry focused narrowly on Ukraine and avoid re-litigating special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cThis was a single, discrete event that was very easy for people to understand.\u201d\n\nWild\u2019s focus on polling is telling. Many Democrats have been privately surprised at how well the issue polls after months of surveys showing a majority of American voters opposed to any effort to remove Trump from office. But polling on a fast-developing issue is tricky, and impeachment could still turn sour for Democrats. Republicans boast that the issue will fire up their base, and Trump\u2019s reelection campaign said it raised more than $15 million in the days after Democrats began more solid moves toward impeachment proceedings.\n\nEven with an impeachment inquiry looming, Rose and Wild were happy to highlight their work on other issues \u2015 and their constituencies were happy to discuss them.\n\nRose, whose town hall was devoted to transportation and commuter concerns, relished getting into the policy details on expanding bus and ferry routes. He touted his collaboration with Republican lawmakers on efforts to protect Staten Island commuters from toll hikes on the Verrazzano Bridge into Brooklyn. And he even welcomed the unlikely prospect of a federal, bipartisan infrastructure bill.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing at all \u2015 impeachment or otherwise \u2015 will distract \u2026 me from my work fighting for you,\u201d he declared.\n\nEven conservatives at Wild\u2019s town hall weren\u2019t focused on impeachment, instead asking what she was doing to help Trump combat China and about Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state. Several liberal questioners focused on climate change, and others focused on education. Wild said the high cost of prescription drugs was the \u201cnumber one issue\u201d in the district.\n\n\u201cI believe that I will get reelected on the basis of the work that I\u2019ve done for the district and not on how this impeachment issue goes one way or another,\u201d she told reporters.", "description": "At town halls in swing districts, there\u2019s little evidence of broad anger from constituents.", "authors": ["Senior Political Reporter", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9572aa2200008c01dc8e91.jpeg?cache=cmd4v0x44h&ops=1778_1000"}
