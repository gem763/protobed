But Republicans are building an argument that the inquiry isn\u2019t legitimate because Pelosi skipped the vote to sanction it.\n\nRepublicans contend Pelosi was shielding politically vulnerable Democrats when she broke precedent and announced last month that the House is holding an impeachment inquiry without the customary vote.\n\nDemocrats are defending dozens of contested seats, many in swing districts that support Trump and where constituents frown on the impeachment investigations. But Republicans say the political advantage Pelosi is trying to maintain by avoiding a vote is breaking decades of precedent and is fundamentally unfair to the Republican minority and the president.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, one of a handful of remaining lawmakers who, as a House member, managed the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, urged Democrats to hold a vote.\n\n\u201cDemocrat House members cannot be allowed to hide behind Speaker Pelosi when it comes to an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump,\u201d Graham said Friday on Twitter. \u201cThey should \u2014 and must \u2014 vote to open an inquiry of impeachment so their CONSTITUENTS, COUNTRY, and HISTORY can evaluate their actions.\u201d\n\nPelosi told Republicans Thursday she is not required to hold a vote.\n\n\u201cThe existing rules of the House provide House Committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a colleague from California.\n\n\u201cThere is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,\" she said.\n\nHouse Republican are ramping up pressure on the Democrats to either vote on an impeachment inquiry or drop it.\n\nRepublicans argue that a formal vote would establish a process for the investigation that would provide the GOP with the authority to call their own witnesses and request subpoenas, among other rights.\n\n\u201cAs you know, there have been only three prior instances in our nation\u2019s history when the full House has moved to formally investigate whether sufficient grounds exist for the impeachment of a sitting President,\u201d McCarthy wrote Pelosi. \u201cI should hope that if such an extraordinary step were to be contemplated a fourth time it would be conducted with an eye towards fairness, objectivity, and impartiality.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Pelosi did not immediately return a request for a comment about Trump\u2019s impending request that the House hold a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi suggested this week that she is not ruling out a vote on an inquiry and that if she does, it could be damaging to Republicans.\n\n\u201cFirst of all there's no requirement that there be a floor vote,\u201d Pelosi told reporters.\n\nShe added, \u201cThat is not anything that is excluded. And by the way there are some Republicans that are very nervous about our bringing that vote to the floor.\n\nSo far, a small handful of GOP lawmakers have spoken out against Trump\u2019s actions, but none are currently serving in the House.", "description": "House Democrats are under increasing pressure to hold a politically risky vote to sanction their impeachment inquiry into President Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5549f8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+59/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F16%2Fd2%2F63a94b1847e3a200689310ed5c2a%2Fnancypelosi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
