Marianne Williamson deleted this tweet after perhaps thinking twice about how it came across:\n\nMarianne Williamson has deleted this tweet pic.twitter.com/YdLRD7UfoZ \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) September 4, 2019\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson on Wednesday deleted a tweet saying that the \u201cpower of the mind\u201d resulted in \u201cmillions of us seeing Dorian turn away from land.\u201d \u201cThe Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas\u2026may all be in our prayers now. Millions of us seeing Dorian turn away from land is not a wacky idea; it is a creative use of the power of the mind,\u201d she said in the now-deleted tweet. \u201cTwo minutes of prayer, visualization, meditation for those in the way of the storm,\u201d she also said in the tweet. The best-selling author replaced her tweet with one offering prayers to people in the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nAs a practicing (and imperfect) Catholic, I certainly believe in the power of prayer. Prayer is what connects us to God and forms us to more readily accept His will above our own desires. Intercessory prayer is also real, from the \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d response to tragedy to more ongoing and specific prayers for peace and justice. We pray for the Lord\u2019s intercession and assistance all the time. However, that also is always \u2014 always \u2014 subordinate to the will of God, rather than a dictate that produces a specific and desired response. When God answers prayer, it\u2019s not because we obligated Him to do so because a certain number of people asked for it in a certain manner.\n\nWhat Williamson described in her deleted tweet isn\u2019t really prayer as much as it is mass telekinesis, or maybe incantations. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t have the impact Williamson credited to it anyway. Dorian didn\u2019t miss the Bahamas, which qualifies as \u201cland\u201d too; in fact, it plowed right over those islands as a Category 5 hurricane. There are likely a large number of dead, not to mention billions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage left in Dorian\u2019s wake.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly missing the US East Coast, either, even if it\u2019s not as bad as the storm track first indicated. States of emergency now exist from Florida to North Carolina, and the damage might still be substantial:\n\nJUST IN: Hurricane Warning now in effect for entire South Carolina and North Carolina coast, NHC says, as Hurricane Dorian moves north; 5-8 feet of storm surge expected in areas of South Carolina.

Roy Cooper urges residents in areas under evacuation order to \"leave now.\" \"Please don't let familiarity get in the way of good judgment\u2026 It's not worth putting your life at risk, or endangering first responders.\" https://t.co/06Lpdh809A pic.twitter.com/COqU6kcb1r \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 4, 2019\n\nWilliamson has been trying lately to escape her hippy-dippy reputation, Politico reports, which might explain why she belatedly thought twice about the tweet:\n\nWilliamson has begun to push back more on being written off because of her quirks, and has claimed in recent interviews that a string of news stories highlighting her past skepticism of vaccines and antidepressants were part of a smear campaign. In a New York Times Magazine profile published this week, she expressed confusion about why people associated her with the practice of healing crystals, and suggested there was a double standard when it came to perceptions of her campaign. \u201cWhen David Brooks says it, it\u2019s profound,\u201d she said of the Times columnist. \u201cWhen I say it, it\u2019s woo-woo.\u201d\n\nMaybe, but her first tweet was pretty \u201cwoo-woo,\u201d and I doubt David Brooks was saying it. More prosaic is the observation that the Internet is pretty much forever, so presidential hopefuls attempting to cast themselves as non-\u201cwoo-woo\u201d might want to think first before suggesting that mind power can re-direct hurricanes.\n\nFor everyone else in Dorian\u2019s path: We\u2019re praying for you, but get out of the way if you can.\n\nLater, Williamson argued that her critics were denigrating prayer:\n\nI was born and raised in Texas so I\u2019ve seen it. Millions of people today are praying that Dorian turn away from land, and treating those people with mockery or condescension because they believe it could help is part of how the overly secularized Left has lost lots of voters. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) September 4, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of denigration of prayer too, and it\u2019s good to have at least one Democratic presidential candidate defending it. In this case, however, the criticism of Williamson\u2019s tweet had less to do with prayer and more to do with her other claims of success from \u201cthe power of the mind.\u201d The two are not the same thing, because the power of prayer does not originate in the human mind. It originates with, and is oriented to, God.", "description": "\u201cWhen I say it, it\u2019s woo-woo.\u201d", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Williamson.jpg"}
