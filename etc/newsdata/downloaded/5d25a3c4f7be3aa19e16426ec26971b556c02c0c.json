He's meeting with an alligator breeder about filling a moat at the border,' Pence stated.\n\nThe trio then worried about potential subpoenas, with Bill Barr (Aidy Bryant) suggesting they should no longer leave traces of evidence.\n\n'I think we should stop texting about the crimes and maybe tell the crimes over the phone so that the crimes don't leave little crime footprints!' she quipped.\n\nGiuliani (Kate McKinnon) then snapped: 'Maybe we should get our story straight!'\n\nSNL used the line to subsequently roast Pence's frosty relationship with the LGBTQ community, by having his character respond: 'Even if our stories aren't straight right now, we could still convert them, right?'\n\nThe cast of SNL skewered President Trump 's closest political allies in its cold open on Saturday night. Kate McKinnon (left) played Rudy Giuliani, while Matthew Broderick (right) appeared as Mike Pompeo\n\nBeck Bennett played a panicked Vice President Mike Pence, who stated: 'Even if our stories aren't straight right now, we could still convert them, right?'\n\nTo cheers and applause, Matthew Broderick made a special guest appearance in the cold open, walking into the room playing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n'Listen, I've been asking around and I think that this whole impeachment thing could be bad!' he stated.\n\n'Says who?' asked Giuliani, before an anxious Barr responded: 'America!'\n\nThe Attorney General soon fled the room, as did Giuliani - claiming he had to make an appearance on Fox News.\n\n'While I'm gone, you guys should get your stories straight. Tell them Hunter Biden started pizzagate or explain how this can all be traced back to - text it to me so the feds have a record. I'll be back!' Giuliani said.\n\nAidy Bryant played Attorney General Bill Barr, who appeared anxious about the impeachment inquiry\n\nPence promptly began to worry that all the members of the Trump Administration were deserting him, to which a departing Matthew Broderick replied: ''Impeachment moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it!'\n\nThe star - spoofing his most famous line from Ferris Bueller's Day Off - then disappeared from the room.\n\n'Wow, it looks like I'm here all alone,' Pence petulantly stated.\n\nMike Pence was soon left on his own, wondering why so many members of the Trump Administration have jumped ship\n\nHowever, an assistant soon arrived with a wicker basket, saying: 'Stephen Miller wanted to talk to you.'\n\nThe program roasted the controversial White House Adviser, by having his character played by a robotic snake who slithered up from under the lid.\n\n'Do you have any way out of this impeachment?' Pence asked.\n\nA slithering Stephen Miller replied: 'Get Nicolas Cage to steal the constitution and blame it on immigrants!'\n\nThe program roasted controversial White House Adviser Stephen Miller, by having him played by a robotic snake who slithered up out of the basket\n\nAt that moment, Giuliani burst back into the room fresh from his Fox News appearance.\n\n'I killed on Hannity!' he stated, clad in Joker clown make-up.\n\nThe cold open subsequently ended with Giuliani and Pence (McKinnon and Bennett) looking directly into the camera, stating: 'Live from New York, it's Saturday night!'", "description": "The cast of SNL skewered President Trump's closest political allies in its cold open on Saturday night.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/05/19351308-0-image-a-39_1570335112856.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
