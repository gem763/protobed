It is rare for a citizen of Russia, a close ally, to be detained.\n\nIran denies following a policy of diplomatic hostage taking, saying that all detainees are facing legitimate criminal investigations.\n\nMs Yuzik, a specialist on the North Caucasus who has written for dozens of Russian and Western publications, arrived in Iran on Sunday but immediately ran into trouble when her passport was confiscated at the airport.\n\n\u201cShe was there for several days without documents. Then men came to her hotel, kicked in the door and took her away,\" her former husband Boris Voitsekhovsky told the Telegraph.\n\nIn a brief call with her mother on Thursday evening, she said she was being held in a prison cell and was due to appear in court on charges of working with Israeli intelligence on Saturday.\n\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since 2016.

He said he was unaware of any reason to believe she was under suspicion in Iran.\n\nIran's foreign ministry told Russian news agencies late on Friday that Ms Yuzhik had been detained for questioning and would be released \"shortly\", but did not give further details.\n\nJason Rezaian, a former Tehran bureau chief of the Washington post who spent a year and a half in Iranian detention after being accused of espionage in 2014, wrote on Twitter: \"that\u2019s what they said about me and so many others.\"\n\nThe rapid response to Russia's complaints contrasts with the long-running disputes over several dual nationals from Western countries.\n\nThey include Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, the mother of one from Hampstead who has been held on espionage charges since 2016 and whose case has become a matter of fierce diplomatic contention between Iran and Britain.\n\n\u201cWill be released soon\u201d.. that\u2019s what they said about me and so many others. https://t.co/tDuAZs9ASn \u2014 Jason Rezaian (@jrezaian) October 4, 2019\n\nRichard Ratcliffe, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, said Ms Yuzik\u2019s detention appeared to fit the same pattern as that of his wife.\n\n\u201cMore and more people are being taken, including from countries with ostensibly good relations with Iran. It is a clear escalation in an increasingly overt tactic of hostage diplomacy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cState hostage taking is an issue that needs to be on the table at the United Nations Security Council. It really does need to be something that the great powers are sitting down and working out. This is getting out of control.\"\n\nIn a separate case, Iran on Friday accused France of \u201cunacceptable interference in its domestic affairs\" after diplomats sought access to Fariba Adelkhah, a French-Iranian academic who has been held since summer.", "description": "Iran agreed to release a Russian journalist detained on suspicion of spying for Israel, in a rare concession\u00a0that defused\u00a0a potentially damaging diplomatic rift with its key ally.
