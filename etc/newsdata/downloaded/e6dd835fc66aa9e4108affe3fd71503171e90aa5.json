Given that his suspension is without pay, Ayton will forfeit more than $2.1 million of his $9.6 million salary.\n\n\u201cI want to apologize to my family, the entire Suns organization, my teammates, partners, our fans and the Phoenix community,\u201d Ayton said in a statement obtained by ESPN, adding that he plans to appeal the suspension with the help of the National Basketball Players Association. \u201cThis was an unintentional mistake and unfortunately I put something in my body that I was completely unaware of. I do understand the unfortunate impact that this has on so many others, and for that I am deeply sorry. I\u2019m extremely disappointed that I\u2019ve let my team down.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NBA\u2019s comprehensive anti-drug program includes random testing for marijuana, steroids and drugs of abuse. A positive test triggers a range of consequences \u2014 from a warning or a lifetime ban \u2014 depending on the substance.\n\nAny player testing positive test for a diuretic, which can potentially mask a drug test\u2019s results, shall be, according to the program, \u201cdeemed to have tested positive for a steroid or performance-enhancing drug and shall suffer the applicable consequences.\u201d Because the league issues a 25-game suspension for first-time violations involving steroids and performance-enhancing drugs, that\u2019s what Ayton received.\n\nPhoenix selected the 7-foot-1 Ayton, who spent one year at the University of Arizona, at the top of a talented draft class. That decision drew some second-guessing last season, as Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic ran away with rookie of the year honors and Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young finished second. Even so, Ayton averaged 16.3 points and 10.3 rebounds per game as a rookie and is viewed as a central piece of a young Suns nucleus that also includes guard Devin Booker.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAyton\u2019s extended absence will be a major blow to the Suns, who are seeking to generate some positive momentum after nine straight lottery trips. Following a 19-win season last year, Phoenix named James Jones as its full-time GM, hired Monty Williams as head coach and acquired a host of veteran players, including Ricky Rubio, Aron Baynes and Dario Saric. Baynes, a 32-year-old center who spent the past two seasons with the Boston Celtics, will likely move into a starting role until Ayton\u2019s return.\n\nRead more on the NBA:\n\nAD", "description": "Phoenix's big man, who was the NBA's top overall pick in 2018, tested positive for a diuretic.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3Ggm3NuvGzDqtq6Gn7lg0eM_ueg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NIJW5KXWDEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
