Last week, millions of children took part in the global climate strike and this week the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg excoriated world leaders at the UN headquarters in New York for their \u201cbetrayal\u201d of young people.\n\nBP sponsors the RSC\u2019s \u00a35 ticket scheme for 16- to 25-year-olds, but the school strikers say the theatre company\u2019s tie-up puts young people in an impossible position.\n\n\u201cIf we, as young people, wish to see an affordable play at your theatre we have to help to promote a company that is actively destroying our futures by wrecking the climate,\u201d the letter says.\n\n\u201cAs an organisation that appears to care about climate breakdown, it simply makes no sense for you at the Royal Shakespeare Company to be accepting sponsorship from a company that is the third biggest corporate source of greenhouse gases in history.\u201d\n\nThe pressure is growing on arts institutions to sever their ties with fossil fuel firms, and this year there have been a series of protests by artists and campaigners at UK cultural institutions such as the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Natural History Museum.\n\nIn June Mark Rylance, who had been an associate artist with the RSC for 30 years, resigned from his position saying BP\u2019s sponsorship deal allowed the company to \u201cobscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d, which he said threatened the future of the planet.\n\nSchool strike organisers say the RSC \u201cneeds young people far more than it needs BP, with children and young people making up the bulk of the audiences of its hit show Matilda the Musical\u201d.\n\nEden, a 19-year-old student at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London, is one of the organisers who has signed the letter.\n\n\u201cShakespeare said \u2018the great globe itself shall dissolve\u2019. By endorsing BP, the RSC is allowing his words of the past to become a horrifying reality. Continued support of the oil industry will not only destroy my future, but is already causing terrible suffering to people on the frontline of the climate crisis right now,\u201d Eden said.\n\n\u201cHow can you sleep at night knowing that you\u2019ve tied the purity and hope of the arts to BP\u2019s dirty, colonial extractive practices?\u201d\n\nCatherine Mallyon, the RSC executive director, and Gregory Doran, the artistic director, said: \u201cWe welcome the conversation around this issue and will respond once we receive the letter. We recognise the importance for a continuing, robust and engaged debate, we acknowledge the climate emergency and recognise the strength of feeling especially amongst our young people.\n\n\u201cOur work with over 500,000 students annually means their feedback and opinions are very important to us. This subject is very much live at the RSC with our artists, staff, board and our audiences and we look forward to reviewing the contents of the letter.\u201d\n\nA BP spokesman said: \u201cBP has been supporting the arts in the UK for over 50 years and our support allows the institutions we partner to widen access and extend the reach of their productions and exhibitions.\n\nBP boss says protests against its arts funding 'just feel odd' Read more\n\n\u201cOur position on climate is clear \u2013 the world is on an unsustainable path and needs to move to net-zero carbon emissions in the decades to come. Everyone will have to play their part in addressing this challenge: individuals, governments and companies such as BP.\n\n\u201cWe are investing to grow low carbon businesses and activities and working and investing in our other businesses to reduce emissions from our operations.\u201d\n\nJess Worth, co-director of the campaign group Culture Unstained, which has been spearheading the campaign against fossil fuel involvement in the arts, said the move by young activists was a significant blow to the theatre company.\n\n\u201cThis is another example of young people finding their power and using it to create change in institutions that, until now, have taken their concerns for granted,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEducation and schools work is one of the RSC\u2019s priorities, and an important source of income. This is a chance for the RSC to demonstrate how much it values young people, by not just listening but acting on their passionately held concerns.\u201d", "description": "School climate strike activists call on theatre group to sever ties with oil firm", "authors": ["Matthew Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db8441633b3548c2d79bf9741b2055cfc4276212/0_108_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=971e669adcc54b7f69b089df5a4235f8", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
