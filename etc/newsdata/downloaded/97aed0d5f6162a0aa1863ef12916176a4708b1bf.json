Twitter has likewise deemed the ad in compliance, a spokesperson said.\n\nBut Democrats say the dominant online platforms are once again bending or ignoring their own policies against targeted harassment, hate speech and misinformation when it comes to Trump \u2014 a decision that will have major implications for the political ads that tens of millions of voters see between now and Election Day. The 2020 presidential candidates have spent more than $50 million on Facebook ads alone through Saturday, according to figures compiled by POLITICO, with Trump\u2019s $14.4 million total leading the field by far.\n\nThe online companies\u2019 decisions are in keeping with recent statements from top Silicon Valley executives who said they will give a wide berth to speech by political leaders, despite policies that otherwise restrict or prohibit false or demeaning content. That stance also avoids putting them further in the crosshairs of Trump and other Republicans who have accused the tech giants of censoring conservatives.\n\nTo Democrats, though, the trend inspires troubling reminders of 2016, when social media companies failed to halt election disinformation as Russian-linked trolls ginned up fake news about Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"TV stations and social media companies, like Facebook, should refuse to air these baseless ads, which are purposefully meant to deceive voters,\u201d Sabrina Singh, a spokesperson for Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), told POLITICO. \u201cWe should have all learned the lessons from 2016 and social media companies should have to bear more responsibility to prevent lies from being spread against anyone.\"\n\nA spokesperson for another Democratic hopeful, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, called the episode \u201cjust another example of Facebook failing to take its responsibility to its users \u2014 and our country \u2014 seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cMisinformation is misinformation, whether it\u2019s from Russian trolls or Presidents, and Facebook needs to do better,\" said the spokesperson, Aleigha Cavalier.\n\nThe Trump campaign says the Biden ad is true, so keeping it up is totally appropriate.\n\n\u201cThe truth hurts and our ads are 100 percent accurate,\u201d campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told POLITICO.\n\nThe ad alleges that as vice president, Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine unless it fired a prosecutor investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company where his son was a director. In fact, a broad, bipartisan consensus existed at the time in the U.S. and abroad that the prosecutor was failing to probe corruption in the country, including at Burisma \u2014 and no evidence has emerged to support the accusation that Biden was acting to protect his son.\n\nSocial media isn\u2019t the only place where people can see the ad, which also has also run on Fox and MSNBC. But the online platforms have huge reach \u2014 Facebook has more than 2 billion members worldwide \u2014 and an unmatched ability to target messages to specific groups of voters, making them an important messaging battleground for 2020.\n\nThis is just the latest dust-up between Trump\u2019s Democratic critics and the social media companies over how they handle his often incendiary posts and tweets. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has called on Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s personal account over tweets in which he blasted House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and suggested that the House\u2019s impeachment effort would lead to \u201ccivil war.\u201d The company has yet to formally respond to the request, according to a Harris campaign spokesperson, but Trump\u2019s account has remained active, even as a growing number of Democratic officials have called for the company to step in.\n\nIn July, Twitter similarly refused to take down tweets in which Trump called House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings\u2019 (D-Md.) majority-black Baltimore-area district a \u201c disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d and urged four Democratic congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ccrime infested places from which they came.\" One of those congresswomen, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), told POLITICO in September that Twitter should suspend Trump's account.\n\nFree speech advocates say the Democrats\u2019 calls for Silicon Valley to play political gatekeeper risk trampling on constitutionally protected political discourse.\n\n\u201cIt's not Facebook's job to moderate our political debates,\u201d said Jesse Blumenthal, vice president of technology and innovation at the Stand Together coalition, which is backed by the libertarian Koch family. \u201cIt's up to each American to be an informed citizen \u2014 and social media meaningfully enables more speech, which is a good thing.\u201d\n\nThe companies have offered similar explanations of their policies, even as they have faced rising pressure to squelch hate, bullying and fake news.\n\nIn rejecting Biden\u2019s request to take down the Trump ad, Facebook wrote that its decision was based on a \u201cfundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\u201d\n\nFacebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, former British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, said at a conference last month in Washington that \u201cit is not our role to intervene when politicians speak. \u2026 We do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules.\u201d\n\nYouTube has told POLITICO that it doesn\u2019t offer special treatment to politicians, who must abide by its community guidelines. But CEO Susan Wojcicki said at the same September conference that \u201cwhen you have a political officer that is making information that is really important for their constituents to see, or for other global leaders to see, that is content that we would leave up because we think it's important for other people to see.\"\n\nPresidential candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) say tech companies\u2019 decision to keep up misleading election-related ads poses \u201ca serious concern for our democratic process.\u201d She suggested in a series of tweets that Facebook\u2019s actions in particular indicate that the company is \u201ctaking deliberate steps to help one candidate intentionally mislead the American people,\u201d to the disadvantage of other campaigns like hers.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThat argument resonated with one prominent tech mogul, Facebook co-founder-turned-critic Chris Hughes, who said this week that \u201cby deciding to allow outright lies in political ads to travel on Facebook,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u201cis embracing the philosophy behind Trumpism and thereby tipping the scales.\u201d\n\nOthers see a more direct cause linking Facebook, Twitter and YouTube\u2019s decision to stand down on Trump\u2019s ads.\n\nTim Karr, senior director of strategy and communications for the group Free Press, said cracking down on misleading advertising would simply be bad for business, given the millions of dollars that Trump's campaign has poured into political ads across the big social media platforms. \u201cIn truth, this decision may be more about profits than principle,\u201d he said.\n\nHeavily policing the candidates\u2019 ads would also risk stirring up even more GOP allegations that Silicon Valley stifles conservative speech and makes it hard to find or follow right-leaning voices online. The president has frequently amplified that accusation, even holding a daylong \u201csummit\u201d at the White House on the topic in July.\n\nIndeed, Twitter is still facing Republican attacks over its October 2017 decision to block then-Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) from advertising a Senate campaign launch video that included what it called \u201cinflammatory\u201d language about Planned Parenthood and \u201cthe sale of baby body parts.\u201d Twitter caved in a day later.\n\nHence the reluctance to drop the hammer on Trump now, some observers of the industry\u2019s practices suggested.\n\n\u201cIt's reasonable to conclude that Twitter is simply avoiding conflict with their most famous user and his political party,\u201d said Alex Howard, director of the Digital Democracy Project at Demand Progress. \u201cWhether that's because of past bad faith arguments designed to chill the company's arbitration of rules on its own platform or not is not clear, but it's likely.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/23/94/fd820ec6445ba9540b0dc5f117e3/191010-trump-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
