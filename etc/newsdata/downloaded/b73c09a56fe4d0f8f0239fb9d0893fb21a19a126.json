(Loren Elliott/Reuters)\n\nWhen Haiti was hit by a massive earthquake in 2010, the Obama administration gave almost 60,000 of its citizens permission to stay in the United States rather than return home to a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe move continued a decades-old practice of extending \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d to foreigners in the United States whose home countries are deemed unsafe due to extraordinary circumstances such as war or a natural disaster.\n\nReports Wednesday that the Trump administration will not grant the same legal protection to Bahamians as their island nation recovers from Hurricane Dorian were met with some confusion given that humanitarian history. But the news was familiar in other ways, the Migration Policy Institute\u2019s Doris Meissner told The Washington Post \u2014 a seeming continuation of Trump officials\u2019 efforts to cut back a program that grants temporary U.S. residence to more than 300,000 people from 10 countries.\n\n\u201cIt was both expected and unexpected,\u201d said Meissner, who directs the Washington-based think tank\u2019s U.S. Immigration Policy Program. \u201cGenerally, under circumstances like this really catastrophic hurricane \u2026 TPS would be granted.\u201d\n\nNews of the Bahamas decision, which government officials have not confirmed to The Post, comes a day after members of Congress introduced a bill to give citizens of the Bahamas the special status \u2014 and two days after acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said a TPS designation for the country would be \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, this administration has made it very clear that it thinks that TPS has been overused,\u201d Meissner told The Post.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries.\n\nSince 1990, TPS has allowed foreigners who are already in the United States when dangerous conditions develop back in their home country to stay and work in America for up to 18 months. That timeline can be extended if unsafe conditions continue, and many TPS recipients have built lives here over years as their countries of origin struggle to recover.\n\nBut officials have decided against TPS for Bahamians because of unspecified \u201cstatutory obstacles,\u201d the time relief would take and the number of people whom the policy would cover, according to CNN, which cited an unnamed member of the administration.\n\nMeissner said she is not sure what statutory issues could block TPS status, calling the designation \u201cone of the most straightforward and quite simple things that an administration can do.\u201d And, she said, the population who could benefit is relatively small: The Migration Policy Institute estimates that about 33,000 Bahamians live in the United States, mostly in Florida, while the biggest TPS designation, for Salvadorans, covers 195,000 people.\n\nBut the concerns about the length of a country\u2019s prospective recovery would not be new. The Trump administration has argued against TPS extensions, saying that home conditions have improved and that Haitians, for example, should not get to stay in the United States nearly a decade after the earthquake that led to protected status.\n\nEfforts to kick TPS recipients out of the country have brought protests and legal challenges, though, as opponents say the administration\u2019s policies will tear families apart and send people back to countries in no shape to receive them. A class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other plaintiffs pointed to emails between Trump appointees and diplomats who protested that countries had not sufficiently recovered.\n\nThose arguments have found support from judges, who repeatedly blocked TPS cutbacks: Earlier this year, the government said it would extend protected status for a quarter of a million immigrants from four countries \u2014 El Salvador, Haiti, Sudan and Nicaragua \u2014 following a federal court order, though another court has shown a willingness to rethink. And a judge last year described \u201cserious questions\u201d over whether DHS decisions were \u201cinfluenced by the White House and based on animus against nonwhite, non-European immigrants in violation of Equal Protection guaranteed by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration could be loath to take in more foreigners who could stay years while the Bahamas rebuild, Meissner said, though she added the country seems positioned for a quicker recovery than poorer nations such as Haiti.\n\n\u201cThe thinking is that once you get into a program like this, you don\u2019t get out of it, no matter what,\u201d she said.\n\nCritics see the reported Bahamas decision as further evidence of a broad hostility in the administration to immigrants, pointing to the president\u2019s focus on \u201cbad people\u201d in the Bahamas when he discussed hurricane relief measures earlier this week.\n\nAsked if he would support a TPS designation, Trump said that \u201cwe\u2019re talking to a lot of different people on that,\u201d but he went on to air concerns about \u201csome very bad people and some very bad gang members and \u2026 drug dealers\u201d who could come to the United States from the Bahamas.\n\nThe comments drew comparisons to the president\u2019s past statements about Mexican immigrants.\n\n\u201cHis response is not about how badly the Bahamas are battered, not about whether the Bahamas would be safe,\u201d said Karen Musalo, a professor and director of the center for Gender and Refugee Studies at U.C. Hastings College of the Law. \u201cIt\u2019s always a demonization of people.\u201d\n\nMembers of Congress who backed Tuesday\u2019s bill advocating TPS status for Bahamians had strong words, too.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really a bigot in chief,\u201d said Sarah Sinovic, a spokeswoman for Rep. Yvette D. Clarke (D-N.Y.), who introduced the legislation. \u201cHe has an anti-immigrant agenda, and that trickles down into all the policies that he\u2019s trying to enforce.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nClarke\u2019s bill accumulated 25 co-sponsors within a day, Sinovic said. But news of the administration\u2019s latest decision-making has thrown a wrench in the initiative.\n\nClarke is \u201cfrankly disappointed but not surprised,\u201d Sinovic said.\n\nScrutiny of the TPS decision comes after concerns erupted Sunday over displaced Bahamians who were turned away from a ferry to Florida, an incident that Customs and Border Protection blamed on the boat\u2019s operator. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have urged the government to let refugees of Dorian bypass all visa rules to find safety in the United States.\n\n\u201cIf your life is in jeopardy and you\u2019re in the Bahamas \u2026 you\u2019re going to be allowed to come to the United States, whether you have travel documents or not,\u201d CBP commissioner Morgan said in his response to the controversy.\n\nBut \u201cwe still need to vet you to make sure we\u2019re not letting dangerous people in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department website still outlines visa requirements for citizens of the Bahamas, saying the U.S. Embassy in Nassau is open for emergency appointments about documents.\n\nRead more:\n\nCrews in the Bahamas keep finding bodies.
