Currently, plastic is slightly cheaper to make from fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe need a solution, something that can happen at speed and at a global scale,\u201d Forrest, 57, said in an interview in New York, just ahead of the U.N. announcement. \u201cThe only association in the world that can do that is business.\u201d\n\nThe Coca-Cola Co., Walmart , Tesco , Unilever , and Reliance Industries , the largest plastics group in India, are among the corporations that have agreed to participate in the voluntary plan, which will increase the raw cost of making plastics by fossil fuels by about US$300 to US$500 a ton\u2014depending on the kind of plastic. Forrest is in discussions with other major companies about the voluntary contribution as well, including Saudi Aramco, which is supportive.\n\nThe dollars raised from this voluntary payment will fund an initiative called Sea the Future. Forrest\u2019s family foundation, the Minderoo Foundation, announced on Wednesday that it is seeding the effort with a US$300 million donation.\n\nForrest, the former CEO and current non-executive chairman of Fortescue Metals Group, the Australian iron-ore producer, has been interested in the ocean environment since he was a child and saw the damage to coral reefs caused by fish trawlers. Only three days ago he turned in his doctoral dissertation in marine biology to the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Western Australia, in Perth, concluding the major recurring threat to the marine life is plastic.\n\n\u201cThe PhD taught me more about marine death than marine life, and the trillions of species that senselessly die because of plastic,\u201d Forrest says.\n\nAndrew Forrest, Courtesy of Minderoo Foundation\n\nA paper Forrest co-authored in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, published on Wednesday, points out that plastic waste costs society US$2.2 trillion a year. Yet it continues to be produced on a massive scale.\n\n\u201cOf the 6.3 billion tonnes of fossil fuel-derived plastic (FFP) waste produced to date, only 9% has been recycled; the rest being incinerated (12%) or dumped into the environment (79%),\u201d the paper says.\n\nA voluntary contribution to fund an industry transition will be effective because \u201cit makes every bit of plastic an article of value,\u201d Forrest says. Although that added value should be \u201cbarely noticeable to the consumer,\u201d it makes it economical, particularly in poverty-stricken countries that are riddled with plastic waste, for individuals to pick it up and recycle it.\n\n\u201cPlastic goes from a toxic waste and threat to human and animal life to a resource to send kids to school,\u201d Forrest says.\n\nA similar trajectory happened with scrap metals, which once littered the environment until the industry recognized the value of recycling it. Today, Forrest says his biggest competitor in the global iron ore industry is scrap recycling. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to get to the same point with plastic.\u201d\n\nThe voluntary levy is expected to raise at least US$20 billion a year\u2014\u201ca conservative estimate,\u201d according to Forrest\u2014to support the industry\u2019s transition to deriving plastic from plastic waste and to eventually fund clean-up of the oceans and environment that are polluted by plastics.\n\nInitially, 90% of the fund will support the industry transition, but Forrest expects that in five years, at least half of the dollars raised can support clean-up efforts.\n\nAccording to Forrest, all plastic can be converted into new plastic.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a plastic we can\u2019t treat\u2014it\u2019s not technical, it\u2019s economical,\u201d Forrest says. Once the weight is shifted to make the costs higher to produce fossil-fuel derived plastic, \u201cthe world turns to polymers from waste instead of polymers from fossil fuel, and in a few years, we have no more plastic waste.\u201d\n\nMaking this vision of a \u201ccircular economy\u201d work in practice, however, will take more businesses, including plastic resin producers, to come on board, and the approval of governments and regulators, steps Forrest is acutely aware need to be taken.\n\n\u201cThis is a pass-through voluntary contribution, which will need to be allowed by the governments, who will instruct regulators to not invoke antitrust where common good applies,\u201d he says.\n\nForrest spoke with U.S. government officials at the White House over the weekend, and said he received a \u201cwarm\u201d initial reception to the initiative.", "description": "A voluntary levy paid by industry would spur a \u201ccircular economy\u201d for plastics", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110956/social", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
