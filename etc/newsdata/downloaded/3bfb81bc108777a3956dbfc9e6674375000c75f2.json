It\u2019s just crazy.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Michelin released a statement regarding the demotion of the chef\u2019s restaurant, saying the company \u201cunderstands the disappointment for Mr Veyrat, whose talents no one contests, even if we regret his unreasonable persistance with his accusations\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur first duty is to tell consumers why we have changed our recommendation. We will carefully study his demands and respond calmly,\u201d Michelin said.\n\nIn July, following his Michelin-star demotion, Veyrat demanded that his restaurant be removed from the Michelin guide.\n\nHowever, despite the chef\u2019s request, Michelin said it would not remove La Maison des Bois from its guide.\n\n\u201cWe are not removing the restaurant La Maison des Bois from the Michelin Guide. If the institution remains open and our inspectors evaluate the table at one of our awards, we will continue to recommend it,\u201d said Gwendal Poullennec, international guide director at Michelin.", "description": "A French chef has said he is suing the Michelin guide after he was \u201cmistakenly\u201d stripped of a star earlier this year.
