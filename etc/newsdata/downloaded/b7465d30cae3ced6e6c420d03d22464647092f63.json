He was 56.\n\nGiordani had a heart attack following lunch at his home in Monte Tauro, a suburb of Augusta in Sicily, and could not be revived, his vocal coach, Bill Schuman, told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cI talked to his wife, Wilma,\u2019\u201d Schuman said. \u201cHe said he was thirsty, got up from his chair for some water and collapsed. They had a helicopter-ambulance come in, but he was already gone.\u201d\n\nIn an era when the Three Tenors waned in the 1990s and 2000s, Giordani was sought after in lyric and later spinto roles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tragic loss,\u201d soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming, a frequent singing partner, wrote in a text to the AP, recalling him as \u201ca remarkably lovely man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe possessed the easiest, most clarion high notes, and was convincing in every role,\u201d she said.\n\nBorn in Sicily on Jan. 25, 1963, Giordani was the son of a prison guard who retired and then owned a gas station.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mostly where I made my debut, making coffee,\u201d he said in an interview with the AP in 2007. \u201cPeople still remember me when I was 12 or 13, singing or bringing coffee.\u201d\n\nHe moved to Milan when he was 23. He made his professional debut as the Duke in Verdi\u2019s \u201cRigoletto\u201d at Spoleto, Italy, in 1986, and sang his first performance at Milan\u2019s Teatro alla Scala as Rodolfo in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boheme\u201d in 1988.\n\nHis American debut followed as Nadir in Bizet\u2019s \u201cLes Pecheurs de Perles (The Pearl Fishers)\u201d at the Portland Opera during the 1988-89 season, and he made his first appearance at the Vienna State Opera in 1992 as the Italian Singer in Strauss\u2019 \u201cDe Rosenkavalier.\u201d\n\nGiordani considered the key to his career his move to New York in 1994, when he began studying with Schuman. Conductor Riccardo Muti told Giordani he needed to improve his technique, and Giordani\u2019s agent, Matthew Laifer, directed the tenor to Schuman.\n\nGiordani called Schuman \u201cmy miracle, my blessing.\u201d\n\nDebuts followed in 1995 at London\u2019s Royal Opera as Alfredo in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d with conductor Georg Solti and at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Opera as Rodolfo.\n\nHe sang Gabriele Adorno in Verdi\u2019s \u201cSimone Boccanegra\u201d at Covent Garden in 1997 during Solti\u2019s final opera performances before his death that September. In 2003, he sang Henri at the Paris Opera\u2019s first production since 1863 of the original French version of Verdi\u2019s \u201cLes Vepres Siciliennes.\u201d\n\nGiordani became a regular at the Met, singing 241 performances through the 2015-16 season and moving often moving his family to a New York apartment for either the autumn or spring portion of the season.\n\nHe sang Pinkerton in Puccini\u2019s \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d in the opening night of the 2006-07 season in the premiere of Anthony Minghella\u2019s production.\n\n\u201cHe was able - and I think this is unusual - to surrender any preconceptions he had about a role he has sung many times before and arrive in our production as an enthusiastic innocent,\u201d Minghella said.\n\nThat high-profile night, led by music director James Levine, was the first performance of Peter Gelb\u2019s term as general manager.\n\n\u201cCertainly the top of his voice is incredible,\u201d Gelb said then. \u201cHe is a great singer, a great artist.\u201d\n\nThat same year, Giordani performed in the Great Hall of the U.S. Supreme Court at the invitation of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nGiordani later ranged into some heavier roles, including Don Jose in Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d and the Aeneas in Berlioz\u2019s \u201cLes Troyens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m pretty able to understand what is good for me to sing or not,\u201d Giordani said. \u201cI\u2019m in the business for almost 20 years. I could sing the heavy repertoire 10 years ago, but I decided, \u2018Don\u2019t do it\u2019 because I saw many, many singers fall down choosing the heavy repertoire, make a huge amount of money in five years and then disappear.\u201d\n\nYet, age took a toll, and he lessened his appearances on the major stages in recent seasons. He established the Marcello Giordani Foundation to support young singers.\n\n\u201cHis choice to create a foundation in support of young singers at such an early age was unusual,\u201d Fleming said.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, the former Wilma Ahrens, and sons Michele and Gerard Andre.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tenor Marcello Giordani, renowned for a voice of beauty and heft that made him a star at the world's top opera houses, died Saturday.
