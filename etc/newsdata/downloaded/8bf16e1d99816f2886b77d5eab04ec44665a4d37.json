The agreements create a rare trend: cash flowing from a tech giant into the news industry. (Full disclosure: POLITICO is among the news partners.)\n\nFor years, leaders in the news industry have spoken out about how Facebook and Google\u2019s dominance in digital advertising has starved media organizations of ad dollars, once a reliable source of revenue. And more recently, that dynamic has featured in separate antitrust investigations into the company at the state, federal and congressional levels.\n\nBut early signs suggest Facebook moving to open its pocketbook for the news industry isn't likely to appease regulators and legislators probing the company.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s encouraging to see that Facebook is taking the threat they pose to news publishers seriously, it\u2019s clear that that this is not nearly enough. It\u2019s not even close,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), whose House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee is investigating possible anticompetitive conduct by Facebook and other tech giants.\n\nRep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the top Republican on House Judiciary, added, \u201cWe will have to see how it is executed and whether it addresses the antitrust issue that burdens community publications.\u201d\n\nHal Singer, an antitrust scholar and a senior fellow at the George Washington Institute of Public Policy, said the cash infusion does little to change what he called an exploitative relationship between platforms like Facebook and the publishers it is now paying for content.\n\n\u201cThe mere fact that you have a positive payment doesn\u2019t mean that that payment reflects the true contributions of the news publishers,\u201d said Singer. \u201cI know that this headline does wonders for Facebook because it seems to put to bed the issue of exploitation of newsmakers, but to an economist, it does not.\u201d\n\nFacebook deciding who's trustworthy is already inviting trouble\n\nTo power its news tab, Facebook has partnered with a wide array of reputable news outlets, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Cond\u00e9 Nast, ABC News and Bloomberg, among others, according to multiple reports.\n\nBut the company quickly came under fire Friday for tapping as one of the launch partners Breitbart, the famously pro-Trump right-wing news site. The decision reignited concerns that the company is unwilling to crack down on right-leaning sites that peddle misinformation out of fear of being accused of political bias.\n\n\u201cShould FB use their terrifying power as an intermediary to make Breitbart disappear? No. Should FB pay them and intentionally amplify their disinformation? Definitely no!\u201d tweeted Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s former chief security officer.\n\nThe controversy over Breitbart's inclusion reflects the risk of inflaming political tensions that Facebook is incurring by introducing the news feature. Launching without any conservative partners would have likely fueled anger from the right, as Republicans from President Donald Trump down accuse Facebook and other social media sites of unfairly stifling conservative viewpoints.\n\nBut bringing them into the fold invited rebukes from critics like Stamos and Angelo Carusone, president of the liberal watchdog group Media Matters, who in a statement called the move \"yet another illustration of Mark Zuckerberg catering to white nationalists and right-wing extremists.\"\n\nZuckerberg declined to address Facebook\u2019s decision to include Breitbart during a New York launch event for the news tab on Friday, but the tech mogul stressed the importance of including differing political viewpoints in its pool of trusted publishers.\n\n\u201cI do think that part of having this be a trusted source is that it needs to have a diversity of, basically, views in there,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think you want to have content that represents different perspectives but that complies with the standards that we have for this.\u201d\n\nSuffering local news outlets may be iced out\n\nFacebook said Friday the initial rollout will \u201cshowcase local original reporting by surfacing local publications from the largest major metro areas across the country,\u201d including New York City, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. And the company plans to eventually bring in smaller markets, drawing on an existing service it runs for identifying and promoting local news, \"Today In.\"\n\nBut putting major commercial hubs first could leave behind smaller cities and rural areas, whose press outlets have been hit hardest by Facebook and Google\u2019s dual dominance over the American digital advertising market, said News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The companies together account for a massive portion of the U.S. advertising market but until now haven't shared the spoils with the news outlets that get linked on their social network and search engine, respectively.\n\nSmaller publications also have less leverage to directly negotiate lucrative deals with Facebook, said Chavern, whose group has lobbied Congress to write an antitrust exemption into federal law to let publishers band together to collectively hash out deals with platforms.\n\n\u201cEven among the largest publishers, Facebook has vastly more leverage and power than any single news publisher,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook is creating a new data trove \u2014 with new privacy risks\n\nFacebook\u2019s new feature will give it fresh access to information about what news items its users click on and how they consume journalism.\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s debut event, Zuckerberg was pressed on how data collected from the news platform might be used to fuel the company\u2019s advertising business. But he deflected the question, saying simply that Facebook is not \u201cselling data\u201d to advertisers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t give data to advertisers, so that\u2019s not changing here,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that argument is unlikely to satisfy critics in Washington, who have scrutinized Facebook\u2019s data-sharing arrangements amid a string of online privacy mishaps, most prominently the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The controversies have helped whip up calls for Congress to set new restrictions on how tech companies collect, use and share consumers\u2019 personal information online.\n\n\u201cThere is a lack of trust now with how Facebook treats user data, and they have to be very careful knowing that that concern is there,\u201d said Charlotte Slaiman, senior policy counsel for public interest group Public Knowledge.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7f/22/f91c77354a8d85c319da4cdc0578/191025-mark-zukerberg-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
