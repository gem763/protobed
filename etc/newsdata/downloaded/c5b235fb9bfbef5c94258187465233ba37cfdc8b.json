I've never had this experience before,' Djokovic said.\n\n'It's one of the most popular sports in Japan. Speaking with my father yesterday on the phone I was telling him that I'm going to have an opportunity to meet sumo wrestlers.\n\n'He and I were remembering many years ago at home (when) we used to watch Akebono (Taro, who reached Yokozuna status), who was someone that we supported a lot.\n\nThe 32-year-old tennis icon joked he was 'out of shape' after the event in Tokyo\n\n'I felt that I am out of shape (for sumo) a little bit. I think with a few more kilos, I'll be ready to compete.\n\n'Probably three times as much as I have right now would be the right measurement for me to compete.'\n\nDjokovic, who will face Alexei Popyrin in the ATP 500 first round, is returning from a shoulder injury which forced him to retire from his US Open fourth-round clash with Stan Wawrinka.\n\nThe muscle appeared to be back at full strength as he scuffled with the sumo wrestler.\n\n'It's quite impressive to see also how flexible they are,' Djokovic added.\n\n'I believe at the beginning they were demonstrating their flexibility.\n\n'I didn't think that they were that flexible considering it's a heavyweight sport, but I see that they are paying a lot of attention to the mobility of their joints and the flexibility, which is of course what allows them to move around as agile as possible at their weight.'", "description": "World No 1 Novak Djokovic has taken an innovative approach to training ahead of the Japan Open by stepping into the dohyo to face a sumo wrestler.", "authors": ["Tom Caldon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/16/19115170-0-image-a-46_1569859028614.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
