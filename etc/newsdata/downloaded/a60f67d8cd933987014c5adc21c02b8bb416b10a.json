The group, which represents the CEOs of the country\u2019s largest firms, also promises to match U.S. counterparts\u2019 investments in training by 2025; to adopt diversity policies; and to invest more in and procure more from tech startups and scale-ups. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: The Liberal government has already offered versions of some of these recommendations: it launched the arm\u2019s-length Canada Infrastructure Bank in 2017 and, in May, it named an advisory committee on regulatory competitiveness. A tax review was among the promises in its fall election platform. But the BCC argues independent watchdogs\u2014not arm\u2019s-length groups that ultimately report to ministers\u2014are needed to ensure things get done between campaigns, and across governments of different levels and parties. The group\u2019s own promises could be expensive: Canadian firms spend $0.81 on workplace training for every dollar spent by U.S. companies.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
