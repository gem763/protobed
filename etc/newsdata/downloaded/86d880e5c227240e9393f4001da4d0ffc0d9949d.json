BA, -6.79% dropped 2.5% in premarket trading Monday, putting them on track to be the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.95% for a second straight session, after reports surfaced that employees felt pressured regarding safety-related approvals of the 737 Max planes. The implied price decline would shave about 58 points off the Dow's price, while Dow futures YMZ19, +0.14% rose 41 points. The stock had tumbled 6.8% on Friday, the biggest one-day selloff since February 2016, after Reuters reported that the company may have misled federal authorities about the safety of the 737 Max, which has been grounded since March after two deadly crashes. Boeing is scheduled to report third-quarter results early Wednesday.", "description": "Shares of Boeing Co. dropped 2.5% in premarket trading Monday, putting them on track to be the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average for a second...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
