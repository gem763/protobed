We will be packing our bags and walking out on October 31. The only question is whether Brussels cheerily waves us off with a mutually agreeable deal, or whether we will be forced to head off on our own,\u201d he wrote.\n\nEuropean leaders have raised serious concerns about Johnson\u2019s new proposals and said that in their current form they are unacceptable to both Brussels and Dublin \u2014 a point reiterated Saturday when Johnson spoke to several EU leaders by phone.\n\nJohnson\u2019s comments came hours after the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned it would be London\u2019s responsibility if no deal is struck.\n\nHe told a Le Monde event in Paris on Saturday that Johnson\u2019s proposals do not address some of the EU\u2019s core concerns about the integrity of the single market and the future of the Good Friday Agreement for peace in Ireland.\n\nIf the British government \u201cdoes not come back with new proposals on the two serious problems\u201d \u2014 the question of customs controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland and London's proposal to have the Northern Irish assembly vote on a future relationship with the EU single market \u2014 then \u201cI do not see how we can advance, but me, I wish to advance,\u201d Barnier said.\n\n\u201cNo deal will never be the EU\u2019s choice,\" the negotiator added.\n\nIrish leader Leo Varadkar told reporters on Saturday that \u201ctime is tight\u201d to find a compromise before the European Council summit on October 17 and 18, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not reasonable to expect 27 or 28 heads of government to decide and sign off on something they only see the night before or two days before.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson told the readership of two popular daily newspapers: \u201cThe way I see it, the proposals published this week represent we in the UK jumping to the island in the middle of the river. If we\u2019re to leave with a deal, we need the EU to jump over from its side and join us there, showing its own willingness to do a deal that the UK Parliament can support.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I say to our European friends: grasp the opportunity our new proposal provides. Join us at the negotiating table in a spirit of compromise and co-operation,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "\u2018No deal will never be the EU\u2019s choice,\u2019 says bloc\u2019s negotiator Michel Barnier.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer", "Thibault Larger", "James Randerson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165930078-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
