The Nationals threatened to mount a rally in the bottom half of the inning when Anthony Rendon reached on a throwing error by Jose Altuve and Juan Soto walked with one out. Peacock wriggled out of his own jam by striking out Howie Kendrick and getting Ryan Zimmerman to fly out to right field.\n\n7th inning: Bregman\u2019s Slam Buries the Nationals\n\nThis is where the lack of a deep bullpen hurts the Nationals. A deeper relief corps could have kept the game within striking distance. But it all started to go downhill when Tanner Rainey \u2014 who, like Josh James, throws hard and strikes out many but also walks many \u2014 walked Kyle Tucker and George Springer to start the frame. He got one out before being replaced with Fernando Rodney.\n\nRodney coughed up a single to Michael Brantley and then threw a fastball low and in to Alex Bregman, who had been relatively quiet this World Series. Bregman kept his swing compact and direct, blistering the pitch over left field wall for a grand slam. It put the Astros ahead by 8-1 and, barring a meltdown, all but assured that the series will return to Houston for at least a Game 6.", "description": "Patrick Corbin will start for the Nationals as they try to take a three-games-to-one lead, while Houston will send the rookie Jose Urquidy to the mound.", "authors": ["James Wagner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/26/sports/26series-live-7-promo/26series-live-7-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
