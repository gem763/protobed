When I originally announced that I was running for Congress in 2009, I was firm in my commitment that I would run for six or fewer terms. After much prayer over the past few days and following conversations with my wife, Gina, during that time, I have decided that my current term will be my last.\n\n\u201cDuring the almost 10-year period since our decision to run for Congress in late 2009, much has happened. During that time, I have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles, spent hundreds of nights away from home and generally worked 12-18 hours per day, six days per week in order to effectively serve over 700 thousand constituents in Central Texas and the Brazos Valley. Our family evolved substantially during that period as Gina lost her father, we picked up a daughter-in-law, added four awesome grandkids and watched my Mom and Dad move further along their senior years. My job as Representative has made it difficult to spend as much time with Gina and the rest of my family as I would like.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bill Flores", "Flores.House.Gov News Documentsingle.Aspx Documentid"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
