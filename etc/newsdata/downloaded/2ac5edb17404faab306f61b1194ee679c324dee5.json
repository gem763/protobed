The very formation of ISignThis was mired in legal contestation, which Karantzis came out of very well back in 2015.\n\nAt the time, Karantzis, through his company Southern Ocean, was a consultant to refinery Sugar Australia, when his services were abruptly terminated by a new CEO, who wanted to bring things in-house. Later, looking into it, Sugar Australia refused to give Karantzis any of his owed termination payments, alleging a coterie of sins, the most pertinent to our interests being that Karantzis' concurrent work on ISignThis meant he couldn't be fulfilling his contractual obligations to work full-time for Sugar Australia.\n\nNeither this nor much of Sugar Australia's other allegations convinced Victorian County Court Judge Maree Kennedy, who threw most of Sugar Australia's case out and awarded Karantzis total damages of $265,000 (minus a phone bill of $164,160 he had to pay back).", "description": "The very formation of ISignThis was mired in legal contestation, which John Karantzis came out of very well back in 2015.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.949%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_118/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/622f5ed271116a59fc411c323c0f5a4f953059fa", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
