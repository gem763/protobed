The team attending the press conference for competition film An Officer and a Spy (J\u2019Accuse) \u2014 an impressively meticulous recreation of France\u2019s notorious Dreyfus Affair, in which an innocent Jewish officer was convicted of treason and banished to a prison island \u2014 are lined up neatly at the podium. But it feels like all of them, even the jostling, expectant journalists, are arranged around an absence \u2014 that of the film\u2019s director, Roman Polanski, who, it bears eternal repeating, fled the U.S. for France in early 1978 before he could be sentenced following his conviction for unlawful sex with a 13-year-old. He has not been to the U.S. since; meanwhile, three other women have alleged that Polanski sexually assaulted them. In 2018, the Academy that awarded him the 2002 Oscar for Best Director expelled him.\n\nThe Officer film team, including cast member Emmanuelle Seigner, Polanski\u2019s third wife, graciously accept a warm reception. The film\u2019s Italian co-producer, Luca Barbareschi (who\u2019s a former member of Italian parliament and one of four actors erroneously believed to have been murdered during the making of Cannibal Holocaust!), is the first to the mic. Speaking in Italian \u2014 forgive the imperfect translation \u2014 he states they will be taking questions about the production and the performances, but nothing else. \u201cThis is a film festival, not a moral trial,\u201d he says. Strangely, given that Barbareschi has essentially just muzzled them, the journalists applaud.\n\nFrench actor Louis Garrel, who plays Dreyfus, charms the Italian contingent by chatting affably in what seems (to a non-fluent listener) to be articulate, colloquial Italian. The film\u2019s star, Jean Dujardin, speaking in French, has nothing but praise for a director \u201cof great intelligence\u201d \u2014 indeed, with a twinkle, he wishes to all actors the good fortune of one day working with Polanski. And when one journalist makes a gentle, diplomatic foray into contested territory, the producers shut her down, and are again met with applause. After exactly the 30 advertised minutes, the press conference is over, a great deal left unsaid.\n\nOne of the subjects not broached was 2019 Venice Jury President Lucrecia Martel\u2019s refusal to attend the film\u2019s gala, at which Polanski appeared via Skype. (The film received a standing ovation when it finally screened for competition.) The film\u2019s producers threatened to pull Officer from the competition if Martel did not apologize; instead she clarified that while she would not attend an event celebrating Polanski, she did support the film\u2019s inclusion in the lineup. The producers were mollified and Martel attended the press screening of the film this morning instead.\n\nStill, Martel\u2019s principled absence from the red-carpet premiere, Polanski\u2019s legally advisable nonattendance at the junket (Italy has an extradition treaty with the U.S.), and the lack of any challenging questions from the press corps: All these absences have been tactfully managed so as to stifle the kind of controversy Polanski himself hinted at, in an interview carried in the film\u2019s press notes. Drawing direct comparison between himself and the persecuted Alfred Dreyfus, he stated, \u201cI can see the same determination to deny the facts and condemn me for things I have not done.\u201d", "description": "An Officer and a Spy (J\u2019Accuse) cast and producers refused to discuss their absent director Roman Polanski\u2019s rape conviction.", "authors": ["Jessica Kiang"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/27/venice-film-festival/an-officer-and-a-spy-1.w1200.h630.jpg"}
