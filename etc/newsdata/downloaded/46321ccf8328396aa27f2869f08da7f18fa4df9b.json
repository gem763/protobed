(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Nationals clubhouse will be even more crowded Tuesday evening, once Michael A. Taylor and Wilmer Difo arrive to rejoin the club for September.\n\nBoth Taylor and Difo have been major league regulars in the past few seasons. Both have gotten shots to be everyday players \u2014 Taylor in center, Difo in the middle infield \u2014 and instead landed in the minors for most of 2019. But with the Nationals able to carry 40 players now, and a pennant push ahead, they will each get another chance to prove themselves in Washington. Difo is a switch-inning utility man who can play second, shortstop, third and even the outfield if needed. Taylor is the best defensive outfielder in the organization and one of the fastest runners.\n\nTaylor could find a role early with Manager Dave Martinez\u2019s announcement Tuesday afternoon that right fielder Adam Eaton has a \u201cbad bone bruise\u201d on the side of his right knee and will be \u201cday-to-day.\u201d Taylor played mostly right field in Class AA Harrisburg. Martinez added Eaton might be available to pinch-hit Tuesday against the New York Mets in an emergency situation. When it was pointed out that third baseman Anthony Rendon missed about two weeks with a similar injury earlier this season, Martinez said he hopes that\u2019s not the case this time.\n\nIf Eaton returns quickly, neither are expected to have a big role in September, with the Nationals already carrying 34 players and the bench deep with Howie Kendrick, Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera, Adri\u00e1n Sanchez, Gerardo Parra, Andrew Stevenson, Ryan Zimmerman or Matt Adams, and Kurt Suzuki or Yan Gomes. The Nationals decided in June to keep Parra instead of Taylor as their fourth outfielder. Then Stevenson was recalled throughout the summer, while Taylor remained with the Class AA Harrisburg Senators, because he is a left-handed hitter. They also decided in the spring that Sanchez, not Difo, would be the 26th player who bounced between Washington and the minor leagues.\n\nBut both Difo and Taylor could be useful in specific situations. Difo is a sure-handed and versatile fielder, even if this April and May didn\u2019t show that. The 27-year-old went to the Class AAA Fresno Grizzlies to clear his head, get regular at-bats and try to iron out the mistakes in his game. He was average at the plate, in the hitter-friendly Pacific League, but reports on his defense were more encouraging. That he can play just about anywhere, and is a switch-hitter, could come in handy if the Nationals play extra innings. The Nationals have also decided to not call up top prospect Carter Kieboom, who plays second, shortstop and third base. Martinez explained Tuesday that Kieboom will go to the team\u2019s facility in West Palm Beach and continue to play during instructional league.\n\n\u201cWe talked about him, he\u2019s obviously a big part of our future, but there\u2019s no sense in bringing him if we\u2019re just going to sit him and he\u2019s going to get at-bats,\u201d Martinez said of Kieboom. \u201cHe\u2019s going to go down there, play, keep in shape and, if anything happens, then he\u2019s ready to go.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s speed is his most attractive tool this time of year, especially since the Nationals\u2019 bench doesn\u2019t offer much. Stevenson has plus speed and has been used as a pinch-runner in the past. When asked about the September call-ups on Monday, and if he\u2019s using this month to piece together a postseason roster, Martinez mentioned that the team could use a runner, a player who can dependably steal a base. Taylor has a lot more experience doing than that Stevenson. If he plays well in the coming weeks, and the Nationals wind up in the wild-card game on Oct. 1, it could prove logical to carry Taylor as a chess piece on the base paths.\n\nThe 28-year-old has had two tough years with the Nationals, ever since he hit .271 with 19 home runs in 2017. He had a rough end to last season, struggling to find a rhythm with inconsistent at-bats. He didn\u2019t hit much at the start of this season, despite offseason swing changes, but also didn\u2019t get many opportunities. He found better results in Harrisburg, albeit against minor league pitching, and was named Eastern League player of the week in August when he hit .360 with one double, one triple, three homers, 10 RBI, eight runs, four walks and two steals in a seven-game stretch. He followed that by going 4 for 4 with four doubles last Friday.\n\nAnd now Taylor could be the final piece Washington needs down the stretch. Martinez saw a near-complete club with a strong rotation, improved bullpen, potent lineup and a list of experienced pinch hitters. Off-the-bench speed was the only missing part.\n\nLINEUPS\n\nMets (70-67)\n\nJeff McNeil LF\n\nPete Alonso 1B\n\nMichael Conforto RF\n\nWilson Ramos C\n\nBrandon Nimmo CF\n\nJoe Panik 2B\n\nTodd Frazier 3B\n\nLuis Guillorme SS\n\nJacob deGrom P\n\nNationals (77-59)\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera 2B\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nMatt Adams 1B\n\nKurt Suzuki C\n\nGerardo Parra RF\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nMax Scherzer P\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nPerspective: The Nationals have been fun for months now, but you wouldn\u2019t know it by looking at the stands\n\nPerspective: The Nats can\u2019t let Anthony Rendon \u2014 his bat, his glove, his personality \u2014 get away\n\nVictor Robles, the 22-year-old rookie, takes charge in the Nationals outfield\n\nJuan Soto is improving his defense one step at a time\n\nAnalysis: Sean Doolittle is a great teammate.
