He also said she should stop pretending to be a member of the press.\n\n\"The first words out of Alisyn's mouth during that interview were, 'Mr. Lewandowski, you refused to answer the majority of the committee's questions.' That's a factual inaccuracy,\" Lewandowski said earlier in the interview.\n\n\"And if you want to be a political pundit and claim that, then that's fine. But don't pretend to be a journalist and then start with factual inaccuracies right off the bat.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHost Howard Kurtz defended Camerota before moving on to another topic and said Lewandowski should've expected tough questions, given the network's relationship with the White House.\n\n\"I worked with Allison Camerota when she was here at Fox, I certainly don't think she's pretending to be a journalist,\" he replied. \"But obviously you go on CNN, you're going to get a hard time.\"", "description": "Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\u00a0said CNN has a double standard when it comes to the truth during an appearance\u00a0on \"Media Buzz\"\u00a0Sunday, pointing out that the network employs former FBI deputy director Andy McCabe, who is under investigation for perjury.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
