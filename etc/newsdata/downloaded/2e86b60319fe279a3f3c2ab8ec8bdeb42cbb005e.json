After two years, which started with stripping back everything the side knew and building back up the team of ludicrously talented individuals, including Andrew Strauss, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann and Jimmy Anderson, England were on top of the world.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty Images 2/11 Joe Denly - 5 Shuffled back up to the top of the order and showed the right kind of resolve as England searched for a draw, holding out for 123 balls.

A second unsuccessful Ashes campaign as skipper. Getty Images 4/11 Jason Roy - 4 Swapped positions with Denly after a torrid time at opener, making 22 and 31. Still looks a long way from proving himself a Test batsman. PA 5/11 Ben Stokes - 4 A crash back to earth after his unforgettable outing at Headingley. Could not produce a third batting miracle of the summer and injured his right shoulder after an expensive stint with the ball. Getty Images 6/11 Jonny Bairstow - 4 Another disappointing return with the bat for a man whose tank might just be empty after a huge workload. Solid with the gloves. Action Images via Reuters 7/11 Jos Buttler - 7 Gave a good account of his battling qualities in each innings in what was easily his best game of the series. Needs a major score soon to silence doubts but this was a start. Getty Images 8/11 Craig Overton - 5 Selected to some surprise ahead of Chris Woakes and Sam Curran, the Somerset man's home debut was a mixed bag. His seamers were only a notch above functional but he dug down for nearly three hours in forlorn pursuit of a draw. AP 9/11 Jofra Archer - 4 Wicketless for the first time in his short Test career in the first innings and down on pace before his juices started flowing midway through the match. Still a huge talent but the quietest of his three outings to date. Action Images via Reuters 10/11 Stuart Broad - 7 Continued his playground bullying of David Warner, dismissing him twice for nought, and took his series wicket tally to 19 with five in the match. No blame attached here. Action Images via Reuters 11/11 Jack Leach - 5 Will forever rue the front-foot no-ball that cost England the best part of 100 runs from Steve Smith's bat, but plugged away and turned in another diligent tail-end defence.

I\u2019d definitely try to work with a person as much as with a player and understand the place that he was coming from.\u201d\n\nThe players were asked to push themselves so hard in everything they did with limited consideration of what the repercussions may be. Having achieved their goal in 2011, things went south pretty quickly.\n\nAll the problems between teammates that were once masked by the quest to become the best in the world and sidelined in the name of achievement began to spill over. The results and personal suffered.\n\nJonathan Trott, a fine England batsman who ended his international career in May 2015 with nine Test centuries and a hat-trick of Ashes victories, has warned England\u2019s next coach that it would be \u201cdangerous\u201d to draw inspiration from previous success in a similar task.\n\n\u201cI think they [the next coach] need to find their own way, I think sometimes trying to copy somebody else or what other people do could be a little bit dangerous and you go away from what feels right at the time if you go into something with a pre-determined idea of what you need to get done,\u201d Trott told The Independent.\n\nTrott scored a century on his Test debut at the Oval in the 2009 series and became a key player as a specialist batsman in the best Test team this country has produced.\n\n\u201cWe were lucky at the time things fell into place,\u201d he added. \u201cWe had a few guys at the back end of their career that started playing really good cricket at county level and started taking that to the English international level and playing for England.\n\n\u201cLook at Graeme Swann, he played for England later on in his career if you like. It\u2019s not just blooding in young players to a new way, you\u2019ve got to have the right players in the right position.\u201d\n\nThe relentless demands of constant success became the eventual downfall of that historic team. Trott was one of a number of players that experienced deteriorating mental health and withdrew himself from the 2013/14 series Down Under, citing anxiety and stress as a reason he was unable to play for England.\n\nCricket has long been a game of immense highs and equally large troughs, even to this day Liam Plunkett revealed he felt a \u201cmassive low\u201d and was \u201cdown\u201d during the days after England won the World Cup final at Lord\u2019s.\n\nTrott reflects that a change in society towards the way we view mental health has helped to develop the way mental health is viewed in sport.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more focus on it now with regards to every industry and that\u2019s the biggest change for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people are willing to open up and talk about things where yesteryear people are perhaps not.\u201d\n\nThe demands of the international cricket schedule is something fairly incomparable with other sports. Playing staff can be travelling far from home and spending up to two-thirds of a year away from their families and regular lives.\n\n\u201cAshley Giles [managing director of English cricket] is very passionate about all formats of the game and getting England to number one in all formats. That\u2019s where the focus is going to be.\n\n\u201cYou have to find the right balance between players playing all the games or they get a little bit of rest. I think the ECB are very good at that now, understanding players\u2019 workload and resting players at the right time,\u201d Trott said of the modern schedule which allows players to join teams all around the world during brief breaks in the calendar.\n\nTaking England beyond India, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia in the Test rankings took blood, sweat and tears as a minimum, the next coach will now do well to learn from history and go their own way.\n\nJonathan Trott was speaking on behalf of \u2018The Test Experts\u2019 Specsavers, Official Test Partner for England cricket ahead of the final Test of the Specsavers Ashes Series at The Oval. Specsavers are encouraging fans to take eye tests and hearing checks this summer.", "description": "It is no secret that the ECB wanted to win the home World Cup more than anything, it is then no surprise that England\u2019s Test team has suffered as a result of increased emphasis on the one-day game.
