Illustration: by Lauren Tamaki\n\nDoing the Most \ufeffis a special series about ambition \u2014 how we define it, harness it, and conquer it.\n\nArtist Marilyn Minter is best known for her paintings and photographs that explore and interrogate images of conventional female beauty: close-ups of women\u2019s faces smeared with makeup and beads of sweat; a high-heeled foot splashing in a mud puddle. Her work, which first gained popularity in the \u201990s, has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions, including the retrospective \u201cMarilyn Minter: Pretty/Dirty,\u201d which appeared at the Brooklyn Museum in 2017. She\u2019s also one of more than 400 artists featured in a new book, Great Women Artists, out this week from Phaidon, in partnership with Kering. She lives with her husband in Soho. Here\u2019s how she gets it done.\n\nOn a typical morning:\n\nI get up around 9:45 a.m. I usually stay up really late reading, so I go to bed around 2 a.m. My husband gets up before me and feeds the dogs, and then I get up and give them a treat. I drink my coffee and read the paper online \u2014 the Washington Post and the Times, and the Huffington Post. Then I get on the subway and commute to my painting studio on 36th Street. I stop and get an iced coffee and a cookie. I eat a lot of sugar and drink a lot of coffee, it\u2019s terrible. But I\u2019ve been a vegetarian for 32 years.\n\nOn organization:\n\nI\u2019m very organized. I have to be because I do so much activism. My inbox is pretty overwhelming. But I have an assistant who tells me, \u201cThis is what you gotta do tomorrow,\u201d that sort of thing. She takes a lot of those emails, so I don\u2019t have to look at them.\n\nOn her creative process:\n\nWhen I\u2019m editing [my photographs], I get in the zone. It\u2019s a lot of fun \u2014 it doesn\u2019t feel like work. I lose track of time. It\u2019s not a struggle \u2014 everything just makes sense. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re writing, and you don\u2019t even have to write the words, they just flow from your fingertips. That\u2019s what I get when I\u2019m painting, and when I\u2019m editing. Sometimes when I\u2019m shooting, I don\u2019t even remember shooting it. Later I\u2019m like, \u201cWow, I shot that?\u201d\n\nOn failure:\n\nYou make a lot of things that don\u2019t work, and you just keep narrowing it down until you get the right image. When everything\u2019s going wrong it\u2019s agony. My least favorite part is when I work on a painting for six months to a year and then I have to erase it and start over. I just wipe out six months of work.\n\nIf nothing\u2019s working, I don\u2019t beat it to death. I\u2019ll eat lunch and then I\u2019ll start over on something else. I don\u2019t try to make things happen. They\u2019re either going to flow, or I leave them alone.\n\nOn self-doubt:\n\nI always get stressed before I start a new project. I totally feel like I\u2019m going to fail. I\u2019ll never get it, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s usually right before the shoot. Who doesn\u2019t have self-doubt? I don\u2019t know anybody who thinks everything they do is great.\n\nOn being part of a community of artists:\n\nWhen I was starting out, I knew that I was going to make a name for myself. I knew I had something to say, but nobody else thought that. Nobody. I just kept doing it anyway. Honestly, I thought, well, I like doing it so much, I don\u2019t care if anyone sees it or not. I get enough pleasure doing it whether or not anyone else recognizes it. So that kept me going.\n\nI also had a network of friends that I respected that admired what I was doing. That meant the world to me. I\u2019ve always had artists friends. We\u2019d go to each other\u2019s studios, and if I really respected an artist and they loved my work, that made my day. It\u2019s actually very sustaining. Think about van Gogh. He had no success during his life from the outside world, but all the artists knew he was good.\n\nI think once in a while, if you do what you believe, the Zeitgeist comes to you. But you can\u2019t make your work fit into the Zeitgeist. You just have to make work that you believe in, and sometimes you\u2019re lucky and you\u2019ll be alive when the Zeitgeist hits you.\n\nOn ambition:\n\nI\u2019m very ambitious. I want to keep getting better at making art, at everything. I want to get smarter, I want to get more articulate, and I want to make better decisions. I\u2019m not satisfied. I still have a lot of curiosity and questions. I\u2019m interested in everything. I read all the time, I go to movies. I travel a lot, and I go to museums everywhere I go. I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m healthy. I don\u2019t say, \u201cOh, gee, back in the day.\u201d I find that very defeating. Back in the day for me is right now. I love today.\n\nOn activism:\n\nSuccess is satisfying for a minute, but it doesn\u2019t fill that hole. I think I get that fulfillment from activism. Right now, I\u2019m trying to organize a shoot for a TV commercial for Planned Parenthood. I\u2019m trying to wrangle celebrities. I\u2019m doing it pro bono. Since 2016, I feel like I really got plunged back in. I\u2019ve always been an activist, though. Ever since I was 16. I grew up in the South, in this really racist school system. I just found it appalling. I was mostly a marcher. I have an activist husband, too. I don\u2019t have any trouble being motivated. I don\u2019t think anyone does these days. Just waking up and reading the paper \u2014 if you\u2019re not upset, you\u2019re asleep.\n\nOn work/life balance:\n\nI used to think that art was more important than life. Now I\u2019m pretty sure that life is more important than art. I\u2019m in a happy relationship, so I compromise: I spend my weekends doing whatever my husband wants to do. Usually it\u2019s traveling. He likes to travel and I like to read, so he drives and I read.\n\nI\u2019m a voracious reader. I love Elena Ferrante, and Lisa Taddeo, and Sally Rooney. I\u2019m a real biography reader. That\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s easy to make your art even if no one pays attention to you \u2014 because if you read biographies, that\u2019s how it was for everybody.\n\nOn competition:\n\nWomen compete with one another. I don\u2019t believe them for a second if they say they don\u2019t. I think that to stay healthy and not be jealous, you have to go up to people whose work you like and tell them how great it is. Just by saying it, all the poison drains out of you. You actually believe it once you say it, and then they become your colleagues and your friends. I\u2019ve been doing it for years now, and it really works. I promote other artists all the time. I went to see Sarah Sze\u2019s show yesterday at Tanya Bonakdar and I immediately took a video and posted it on Instagram. It\u2019s going to change your life.\n\nOn doing the easy thing:\n\nWhen I teach, I tell my students that if something comes easily to you, you should explore it. That means that\u2019s what you should be doing. I see it all the time, a young artist says, \u201cOh, it comes easy, it must not be any good.\u201d I\u2019m constantly trying to get them to see, no, no, that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. The reason I\u2019m so adamant about it is that I dismissed the skill I have for so long. I could draw anything \u2014 I could copy anything. And I got a lot of pleasure out of it. I figured that I couldn\u2019t make art out of doing that. What am I gonna be, a forger? And then I figured out a way to make it work for me.\n\nOn criticism:\n\nI ignore it, unless I think there\u2019s something I can learn from. Most of the criticism I\u2019ve gotten wasn\u2019t very useful because it was mostly stupid. But sometimes there\u2019s a kernel of truth and I try and pay attention. I listen to my friends who I trust who have constructive criticism. I have people in my life who say, \u201cThat\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
