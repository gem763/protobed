But they\u2019re at odds with a U.K. government document quoted in a Scottish court Friday indicating Johnson intends to comply with a law Parliament passed this month requiring the prime minister to ask for a delay if there\u2019s no deal with the EU in place by Oct. 19.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the government will resolve the difference between Johnson\u2019s public stance and the position taken in court.\n\nJohnson\u2019s op-ed appeared aimed at adding pressure on the EU to agree to his latest Brexit proposals as the deadline nears. He urged EU negotiators to join the British side to agree on a deal the U.K. Parliament can support.\n\nAlso Sunday, Johnson presented his proposals to French President Emmanuel Macron, who said EU negotiators will determine in the coming days whether an amiable divorce deal is possible.\n\nThe two leaders spoke about Johnson\u2019s proposals for an accord to soften the blow of Britain\u2019s pending exit from the EU, Macron\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nMacron, who has resisted a potential extension, told the British prime minister \u201cnegotiations should pursue quickly in the coming days\u201d with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, his office said.\n\nMacron said they will determine at the end of the week \u201cwhether an accord is possible in the respect of European Union principles\u201d of the single market and stability in Ireland.\n\nJohnson\u2019s proposals focus on maintaining an open border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, which has been the key sticking point to a Brexit deal. The U.K. proposes to do that by keeping Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU rules for trade in goods, possibly for an extended period.", "description": "British Prime Minister on Sunday renewed his vow to take the country out of the European Union by the Brexit deadline, in an apparent contradiction of a...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS734_borisj_ZG_20191006163432.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
