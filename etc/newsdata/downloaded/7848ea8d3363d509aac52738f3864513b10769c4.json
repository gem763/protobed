With Klopp angered by the VAR decision not to rule out Rashford's goal for a foul on Divock Origi by Victor Lindelof in the build-up.\n\n\n\n\"When we come here this year, last year and the year before they just defend. It's not criticism, it's just a fact,\" added Klopp.\n\n\"The quality they have, (when they) set up like that, it's really difficult. It's no excuse, we needed to do better.\n\n\"We are a good team and it's normal people think about how they stop us.\"\n\nMourinho - working as a studio pundit for Sky Sports at Old Trafford - immediately hit back at Klopp's complaint by pointing to the German's failure to yet claim a win at Old Trafford.\n\n\"That's because he didn't beat Man United at Old Trafford. He didn't like the menu. He wanted meat and got fish,\" Mourinho retorted.\n\nJurgen Klopp complained that United have set up defensively every time they've played since he's been in at LFC.\n\n\n\nMourinho:\"That's because he didn\u2019t beat Man United at Old Trafford.

I don't think it's a foul.\"\n\nCompiled by Baden Gillion", "description": "Jose Mourinho hit back at Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's complaints that Manchester United 'always defend' against his side at Old Trafford.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8391/2243a46891bc42f6ad1f7073fc954bfa.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
