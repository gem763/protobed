The iPhone 11 will cost $699, compared to the $749 price tag on the iPhone XR last year.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives said China is likely one of the primary drivers for the surge in demand as Chinese consumers are drawn to the lower price point, dual-camera functionality, and variety of color options.\n\n\"China as a region is currently one of the main catalysts of demand for the iPhone 11 and is tracking roughly 20% ahead of plan,\" Ives said in a note to clients on Friday. Ives also expects Apple could produce more than 185 million iPhones in 2020 based on the recent demand trajectory.\n\nShares of Apple are up more than 42% year-to-date.\n\nRead more: The man who wrote the book on how to make 100 times your money with a single stock outlines the core principles of his investing approach \u2014 and shares his 2 top under-the-radar picks\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Shares of Apple traded as much as 2.3% higher on Friday morning on a report the company is planning to increase iPhone 11 production.\u00a0 The Nikkei Asi...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d974c18ec72bd0add55f680-1920/screen-shot-2019-09-10-at-23429-pm-2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
