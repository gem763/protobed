REUTERS/Huseyin Aldemir/File Photo\n\nPence, who frequently takes a tough line on China, could easily use the speech to harp on growing American frustration over Chinese treatment of democracy protesters in Hong Kong and Muslim minority Uighurs held in Chinese detention camps.\n\nBut with the speech coming just weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump attends a summit in Chile where he hopes to close a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Pence may be forced to stick to more dovish language.\n\nFears of antagonizing Beijing prompted the White House in June to postpone the speech ahead of a meeting between the leaders aimed at getting trade talks back on track.\n\nThe administration \u201cbragged about how important the speech was going to be, then abandoned it in June, the last time President Trump thought he had a China trade deal,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nThe probable goal of the speech, Scissors said, is to preempt Congress from approving a raft of tough-on-China bills \u201cby using strong language, but offering only watered-down versions of actions Congress is already considering,\u201d he added.\n\nSuch a speech would contrast sharply with Pence\u2019s track record on China. Aides had cast his postponed June speech as a sequel to a blistering broadside he delivered in October 2018.\n\nAt that time, Pence shocked China watchers by laying out a litany of complaints, chastising China for building \u201can unparalleled surveillance state\u201d and for government-run camps in the Xinjiang region where Muslim Uighurs \u201cendure around-the-clock brainwashing\u201d just ahead of a major Asia-Pacific conference that he attended on behalf of Trump.\n\nHis comments laid the groundwork for U.S. authorities this month to include Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision on a trade blacklist, punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities and ratcheting up tensions ahead of trade talks.\n\nPence has also taken China to task over Hong Kong, urging authorities in August to respect the special administrative region\u2019s laws and repeating Trump\u2019s warning that it would be harder for Washington to make a trade deal with Beijing if there were violence in the former British colony.\n\nSince then, lawmakers like Senate Republican Marco Rubio have slammed Chinese companies for boycotting the NBA after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey expressed solidarity with Hong Kong protesters.\n\nThat spat played out amid unexpected progress in U.S.-China trade talks to end a 15-month trade war that has roiled markets and damaged global growth. The United States launched the trade war over allegations of unfair trading practices such as theft of U.S. intellectual property and generous industrial subsidies at the expense of foreign competitors.\n\nDuring a visit by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He this month, Trump outlined the first phase of a trade deal covering agriculture, currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections. U.S. officials said later agreements could address other issues.\n\nThe White House has been nearly silent about the tenor of Pence\u2019s remarks, which he will deliver at a Wilson Center event, saying only that they will \u201creflect on the U.S.-China relationship over the past year and look at the future of our relationship.\u201d\n\nBut many U.S.-China experts see a softer tone as probable.\n\n\u201cThis may end up being one of the most anticlimactic firebrand speeches of all time,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.", "description": "A year after the U.S. Vice President's hawkish speech on China caused an uproar in Beijing, Mike Pence is expected to strike a gentler tone in a second policy address on the country Thursday, as hopes blossom for a partial trade deal with Beijing.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444464182&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0R5", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
