Gee) to block a Louisiana law on hospital admitting privileges from taking effect until the Court ruled on their petition for certiorari seeking review of the Fifth Circuit decision below. Given that action, it was a near certainty that the Court would grant review of the abortion providers\u2019 petition for certiorari. The Court did so in an order today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t at all clear was whether the Court would also grant the state of Louisiana\u2019s conditional cross-petition, which challenges the widespread lazy assumption that abortion providers have \u201cthird-party standing\u201d to represent their patients\u2019 interests. As the cross-petition explains, this assumption is an aberration from the third-party standing rules that apply to everyone else.\n\nI\u2019m very pleased to see that the Court also granted Louisiana\u2019s cross-petition. If the Court were to rule against the abortion providers on third-party standing, it would dispose of their challenge to the Louisiana law, and, more broadly, it would eliminate much of the abortion litigation that besets the federal courts.", "description": "I\u2019m very pleased to see that the Court also granted Louisiana\u2019s cross-petition.
