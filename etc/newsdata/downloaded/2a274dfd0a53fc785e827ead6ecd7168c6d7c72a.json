NTB Scanpix/Hakon Mosvold Larsen via REUTERS\n\nThe man was apprehended after police shot at the vehicle, police said, adding the suspect was not critically injured.\n\nPolice said the suspect had appeared to deliberately hit pedestrians, and that they had found a significant amount of what appeared to be illegal drugs following the arrest, as well as a shotgun and an Uzi semiautomatic weapon.\n\nThey would also investigate whether the suspect had ties to far-right extremists, although a motive had not been established, and it had yet to interview the suspect.\n\n\u201cTwo babies were injured after the hijacked ambulance hit a family. They are twins, seven months old, they are being treated,\u201d Oslo University hospital spokesman Anders Bayer told Reuters.\n\nThe injures were light however, police later said.\n\nPublic broadcaster NRK showed images of an ambulance driving in the Torshov neighbourhood of Oslo while several gunshots rang out.\n\nThe hospital spokesman said the ambulance crew had responded to a routine incident when their vehicle was taken.\n\n\u201cThey were called to an ordinary traffic accident where they were met by the armed person,\u201d Bayer said, adding that the hospital had quickly tracked the ambulance via its built-in GPS device.\n\n\u201cSome minutes later one of our other ambulances managed to stop the hijacked vehicle by crashing into it. Then the police came after the crash and got him,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ambulance came to a halt just over 1.5 km (1 mile) from where it was hijacked.\n\n\u201cAn armed man stole an ambulance, drove away and hit some people. We got him now,\u201d the police spokesman told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to indicate that this incident is terrorism related,\u201d Oslo police operations leader Erik Hestvik told reporters. The police added in a statement: \u201cThe investigation is still in an early phase ... We are conducting a broad, intensive investigation.\u201d", "description": "An armed man stole an ambulance in Oslo on Tuesday, lightly injuring five people including two babies in an apparent attempt to target pedestrians, Norwegian police and hospital officials told Reuters.", "authors": ["Lefteris Karagiannopoulos", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443726361&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L11D", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
