The browser will now use machine learning to recognize what images on the screen are, and offer verbal descriptions of what they depict.\n\nIt's an offshoot of the already-existing feature that lets users search for images by keyword, where the description of the image is auto-generated using computer vision.\n\n\"The unfortunate state right now is that there are still millions and millions of unlabeled images across the web,\" said Laura Allen, a senior program manager on the Chrome accessibility team. She has low vision herself, so she understands what people like her go through everyday.\n\nDon't Miss 265 SHARES\n\nIndian Association for the Blind\n\n\"When you're navigating with a screen reader or a Braille display, when you get to one of those images, you'll actually just basically hear 'image' or 'unlabeled graphic,' or my favorite, a super long string of numbers which is the file name, which is just totally irrelevant.\"\n\nSo how would this new feature work?

From there you can enable \"Get image descriptions from Google.\"", "description": "The Internet can be hard for blind people or those with visual hindrances to navigate.
