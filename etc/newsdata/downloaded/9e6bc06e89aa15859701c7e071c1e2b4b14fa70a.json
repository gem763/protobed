REUTERS/Adnan Abisi/Illustration\n\nA man over age 50 who used e-cigarettes died in Kansas as state health officials prepared to join the waves of experts testifying before Congress on Wednesday, Kansas Governor Laura Kelly announced.\n\n\u201cToday, I am saddened to announce the death of a second Kansan in association with this outbreak,\u201d the governor said in a statement, noting the man had underlying medical conditions.\n\nAnne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will be asked by a House Oversight subcommittee Tuesday about the possible causes of the outbreak, what vaping products may be implicated and what can be done about the disease, which recently has sickened 530 people in 38 states. The parent of a recently stricken Chicago teen will also speak to lawmakers.\n\nOn Wednesday, the acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration will appear before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee and be asked about the public health threats of e-cigarettes.\n\nU.S. officials are working to identify the cause of the outbreak of illness, but no single substance or compound, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the high-inducing component of marijuana, or Vitamin E acetate, has been linked to all of the cases so far.\n\nSchuchat said last week that officials expect more deaths. The CDC, which has activated its emergency operations center to coordinate an investigation, has advised that people quit vaping if they can.\n\nFor those who continue, public health officials urge consumers to avoid buying vaping products on the street, using marijuana-derived oil with the products or modifying a store-bought vape product.\n\nThe House Oversight Economic and Consumer Policy subcommittee\u2019s probe began in the summer, and so far has focused on the role e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc played in what the panel\u2019s chairman, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, has called a \u201cyouth vaping epidemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to know what\u2019s happening to the people falling ill; we need to know how the youth vaping epidemic started, and we need to find out how we are going to stop both. That\u2019s what this investigation is all about,\u201d Krishnamoorthi told reporters.\n\nIn addition to Juul, in which Altria Group Inc has a minority stake, leading makers of nicotine e-cigarettes include British American Tobacco Plc and Imperial Brands Plc.\n\nAlong with Schuchat, the subcommittee will hear from Dr. Ngozi Ezike of the Illinois Department of Public Health and Dr. Albert Rizzo, the chief medical officer of the American Lung Association. Ruby Johnson, the parent of a Chicago teen who fell seriously ill after vaping, will also testify.\n\nRelated Coverage More Americans say vaping is as dangerous as smoking cigarettes: Reuters poll\n\nOn Wednesday, health officials from Michigan, North Carolina, Kansas and Massachusetts will appear before the Energy and Commerce Health subcommittee along with Schuchat and the FDA\u2019s Norman Sharpless.\n\nThe FDA has warned Juul that it violated regulations because it marketed its vaping products as less risky than traditional cigarettes.\n\nThe popularity of e-cigarettes has now grown to the point where one in four 12th-graders reported vaping a nicotine product during the previous 30 days. It is nearly one in 10 for 8th-graders, a study here by the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor reported last week.", "description": "The U.S. House of Representatives begins public hearings this week about a mystery vaping-related lung disease that has sickened hundreds of people across the United States and killed nine.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433285185&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0NU", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
