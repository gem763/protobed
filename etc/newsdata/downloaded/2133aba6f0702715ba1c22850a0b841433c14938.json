The other things that we are developing is the ability to do what I call an MAI appraisal, a sort of certified appraisal,\" Smith said.\n\nGoing Forward\n\nBiproxi expects to have 250,000 listings and over 4,000 registered users by the end of October.\n\nIn the process of achieving those numbers, Biproxi aims to work on the demand side of its platform, increasing the number of successful transactions, Smith said.\n\n\"We need to prove to the agents that by managing their transaction online with us, they\u2019ve got a higher probability of getting their listing sold.\"\n\nRelated Links:\n\nAlexandria Leverages Unstructured Data To Deliver Sentiment Analysis, Increase Alpha\n\nGlobal Debt Registry Accelerates Blockchain Adoption In Structured Credit Markets\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
