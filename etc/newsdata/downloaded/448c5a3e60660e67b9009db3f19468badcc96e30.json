Axios reported Tuesday that a company connected to Guo has been bankrolling former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's projects\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump Organization didn't respond to a request to confirm Guo's membership.\n\nThe first contract gives Bannon $1 million for consulting services beginning in August 2018.\n\nThe next $1 million contract, which wasn't signed, was set to begin in August 2019, Axios reported.\n\nBannon didn't respond to a request for comment from the publication.\n\nGuo Media is owned by Saraca Media Group and Daniel Podhaskie, a spokesman for Guo, told Axios that Bannon was hired thanks to his 'cross-border financial expertise' and retained for 'strategic advisory work regarding media investments, [mergers and acquisitions], joint ventures and cryptocurrencies.'\n\n'Mr. Bannon's work in these areas was complete and he is currently not retained,' Podhaskie continued. 'Mr. Guo is merely the face of Guo Media and was requested by Saraca to act in this capacity given Mr. Guo's outspoken criticism of the Chinese Communist Party.'\n\nChina has petitioned the Trump administration to get Guo back.\n\n'His entire goal has been to take down the [Chinese Communist Party] and free his fellow countrymen in China,' Podhaskie said.\n\nBeyond following the money, Bannon's been working on a radio show and broadcasting it from Guo's New York City home, according to reporting from The Hill newspaper.\n\nIt's a separate project from the one garnering the most news.\n\nLast week Bannon created his own war room with a radio show and podcast literally called the 'War Room.'\n\nBannon, who formerly ran Breitbart News, teamed up with former Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam and 2016 Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller for the project.\n\nThey're putting together the show from the basement of Bannon's Capitol Hill home, long nicknamed the 'Breitbart Embassy.'", "description": "Steve Bannon got a financial bump from a company tied to Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, Axios reported Tuesday, as Bannon has reemerged to defend President Trump.", "authors": ["Nikki Schwab", "Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/18/20340514-0-image-a-31_1572372502323.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
