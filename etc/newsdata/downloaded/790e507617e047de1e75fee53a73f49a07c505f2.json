REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe report came as tensions escalated after the U.S. widened its trade blacklist to include Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision and surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology among others, drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nThe discussions on capital flow restrictions focused on investments made by U.S. government pension funds, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\n\nAdding to the pessimism, a South China Morning Post report said China had toned down its expectations ahead of the high-level trade talks set to begin on Thursday and that the Chinese delegation could depart Washington a day earlier than planned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really much hope that we are going to see a completed deal any time soon,\u201d said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. \u201cFor markets, it may be enough to just see a stop in the escalation.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. action pressured suppliers to the Chinese firms. Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp fell about 1% in premarket trading, while Ambarella Inc slumped 12%.\n\nDow heavyweight Boeing Co fell 1.5% after the Wall Street Journal reported friction between the United States and Europe could further delay efforts to resume flights of the planemaker\u2019s best-selling 737 MAX jets, which have been grounded since early 2019.\n\nThe three main indexes logged their first fall in three sessions on Monday as investors tackled mixed headlines on U.S.-China trade. Risk appetite has also been hit by weak economic indicators last week and intensifying efforts to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nAt 8:14 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 181 points, or 0.68%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 18.75 points, or 0.64% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 48.75 points, or 0.63%.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index is now about 3% off its record high hit in July.\n\nMarket participants will now turn their attention to the third-quarter earnings season beginning next week for evidence of the impact of the trade war on corporate America.\n\nAnalysts expect the worst quarterly profit performance since 2016, with earnings from S&P 500 companies declining nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nAmong other stocks, Nektar Therapeutics slid 6.1% after Goldman Sachs downgraded the drug developer\u2019s stock to \u201csell.\u201d\n\nU.S.-listed Chinese stocks also declined, with Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com Inc and Baidu Inc down between 2% and 2.6%.", "description": "Wall Street was set to open lower for the second straight session on Tuesday, after a report that the Trump administration was moving ahead with discussions around possible curbs on capital flows into China stirred up fresh worries over the outcome of the high-level trade talks later this week.", "authors": ["Shreyashi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438444685&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970UQ", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
