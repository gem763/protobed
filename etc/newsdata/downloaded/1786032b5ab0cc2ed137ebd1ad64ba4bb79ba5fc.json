Specifically, Trump didn\u2019t explicitly make military aid to Ukraine contingent on the investigation taking place.\n\nArizona Rep. Andy Biggs \u2014 who has become one of Trump\u2019s staunchest, and most effective, defenders \u2014 makes the case for the absence of any quid pro quo in a recent column for the American Greatness website.\n\nQuid pro quo? That misses the larger point\n\nNow, impeachment-minded Democrats have certainly asserted that there was a quid pro quo, explicit or implied. But this quid-pro-quo dispute misses the larger, and more important, point: What Trump did was wrong, and an abuse of his power as president, irrespective of whether there was a quid pro quo.\n\nTrump did not ask that Ukraine get tougher on corruption in general. He asked that a specific investigation be conducted into Joe Biden, a political rival, and his son.\n\nWe've never had a president like Trump:Trump's unmatched sleaze: Grifters, women, trampling Constitution and now G-7 at Doral\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a request to advance the foreign policy objectives of the United States. It was to improve Trump\u2019s odds of winning re-election in 2020.\n\nAny doubt about that was removed by his request that Ukraine work with Rudy Giuliani in the investigation of the Bidens. Giuliani isn\u2019t a foreign policy official representing the U.S. government. He is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. He was representing Trump the candidate, not Trump the president.\n\nIt is inappropriate, and an abuse of power, for a president to ask a foreign government specifically to investigate a political rival. That is what Trump asked of Zelensky privately. And he compounded it by making a similar request to China publicly.\n\nEither way, it's an abuse of power\n\nSuch a request is inappropriate, and an abuse of power, irrespective of whether there is a quid pro quo expressly or implicitly involved. Or whether the foreign government feels pressure to conduct the investigation. Or whether the foreign government would have conducted the investigation anyway.\n\nNow, the abuse is even greater if there was a quid pro quo, and Congress should be investigating the extent to which there was one.\n\nBut it might be looking in the wrong place regarding the military aid, although acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that it was held up, in part, over Ukrainian cooperation in a separate probe into the 2016 election. He later backtracked.\n\nUnelected bureaucrats, unmatched power:The Trump administration's successful war against bureaucratic bullies\n\nThe quo for the Biden investigation may have been a meeting between Zelensky and Trump, which the Ukrainians wanted even more than the aid, as a signal that the U.S. still stood behind Ukraine and its new, inexperienced president.\n\nState Department officials working on setting up such a meeting certainly believed that there was a connection. They drafted a statement announcing both a meeting and a Ukrainian investigation into Burisma Holdings, the energy company on whose board Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, served. The Ukrainian government wisely rejected it.\n\nBut quid pro quo or no quid pro quo, what Trump did was wrong and an abuse of his position as president.\n\nWhat the Bidens did was inappropriate\n\nOn the other hand, Democratic efforts to whitewash what the Bidens did in Ukraine also misses an important point.\n\nThe whitewash, repeated frequently in the traditional media, takes this kind of formulation: There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either of the Bidens.\n\nDon't dismiss this as a conspiracy:Pursuing impeachment is unwise, but that doesn't justify dishonest defense of Trump.\n\nIt would be accurate to say that there has been no evidence of criminal violations of either U.S. or Ukrainian law by the Bidens. But that doesn\u2019t mean that what occurred wasn\u2019t wrong and inappropriate.\n\nHunter Biden was receiving, according to the Wall Street Journal, $50,000 a month to serve on the board of Burisma, at the time that his father was serving as the Obama administration\u2019s point man for Ukraine. That included pressuring Ukraine to get tougher on corruption generally.\n\nWhile it is unclear the extent to which Burisma was under investigation, there\u2019s no question that its principal, Mykola Zlochevsky, was, from a stint in which he held government office.\n\nIn that part of the world, having a Biden on the board conveyed the message of having sway with the Obama administration. That could influence events, including the course of investigations, without either Biden doing anything directly to cause it.\n\nTrump\u2019s claims of corruption are irresponsible. But it was an unseemly situation that compromised the effectiveness of U.S. policy in the country.\n\nRobert Robb is a columnist at the Arizona Republic, where this column originally appeared.
