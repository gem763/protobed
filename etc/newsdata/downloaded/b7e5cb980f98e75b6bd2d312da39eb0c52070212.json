She is looking toward retirement at 65 and wondering if she will be ready. Single, she has no dependents and no company pension plan.\n\nTwenty years into her career, she plans to put in another twenty, pay off the mortgage on her $350,000 condo, then retire with financial security and travel \u2014 something she foregoes now in order to build up her net worth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have my mortgage paid off in ten years and retire at 65 with a big trip annually,\u201d she says. \u201cCan I do that?\u201d\n\nWith assets, including the condo, that total $480,678 and her only debt, $146,388 on her mortgage, she has net worth of $334,290. The question is whether that will be enough, with twenty more years of saving, to finance a secure retirement. Her goal is to have $36,000 in after-tax retirement income.\n\n(Email andrew.allentuck@gmail.com for a free Family Finance analysis.)\n\nFamily Finance asked Eliott Einarson, a financial planner in the Winnipeg office of Ottawa-based Exponent Investment Management, to work with Sally.\n\nBuilding net worth\n\nFor now, Sally earns $84,000 per year or about $60,000 after deductions for taxes and benefits. Her budget currently allocates $583 per month to her RRSP, $752 per month to her savings account and $500 per month to her TFSA.\n\nSally\u2019s only debt is her mortgage, which carries a 2.49 per cent interest rate. She makes bi-weekly payments of $972 \u2014 at this pace the debt will be paid off in seven years when she is 52, well ahead of her ten-year target. After the mortgage is paid in full, she can allocate another $1,000 per month to her RRSP or TFSA savings with the balance going to replace her aging car.\n\nSally\u2019s financial assets include $40,481 in bank accounts and $86,197 in RRSPs for a total of $126,678. If she continues to add $7,000 per year for seven years to the time her mortgage is paid off, the RRSP account would have a balance of $159,650 in 2019 dollars assuming three per cent growth after inflation. Then in 2026, she can allocate $12,000 per year to her RRSP to fill available space. This boost in RRSP contributions for the final 13 years before she retires would grow her RRSP balance to $421,860, with the same assumptions.\n\nRetirement income\n\nAt 65, her RRSP, growing at three per cent after inflation, would be able to generate $20,900 per year for 30 years when all capital and income will have been paid out. She could add $7,290 OAS and $13,855 CPP for total, pre-tax income of $42,045. After 15 per cent average tax, Sally would have $2,980 per month or $35,738 per year to spend. She would have just about attained her target after-tax income of $36,000 and her condo would be paid in full. With no mortgage or other debt and no further savings, her base monthly spending would drop by $3,779 to about $1,425, leaving $1,555 monthly for discretionary spending including an annual big trip under $10,000.\n\nSally can do better if she shifts some savings to a TFSA. She has $40,481 in a savings account. She has $63,500 TFSA space. If she moves $30,000 of her savings balance to a TFSA and adds $500 per month, then in 20 years at her age 65, she would have a balance of $220,242. That sum, still growing at 3 per cent per year, could provide a tax-free payout of $10,900 for the 30 years to her age 95. That in turn would boost her annual pre-tax income to $52,945. With 15 per cent tax but no tax on the TFSA cash flow, she would have $3,886 per month to spend or save.\n\nThat discretionary spending would have to include an allocation for a new or newer car, perhaps new appliances for her condo one day, and some outlay for maintenance for which she currently budgets nothing.\n\nAssuming that car payments are $500 per month, that she allocates $500 per month to travel, $200 for maintenance and that as a single person she pays for some sort of long-term care insurance or puts $500 per month into an account for the same thing, her monthly discretionary income would drop by $1,700 to $2,186. That would still cover a lot of spending for pleasures she presently foregoes.\n\nWhen savings are gone\n\nIf Sally lives beyond 90, her RRSP and TFSA savings would be exhausted with our present assumptions. She would, however, still have CPP and OAS and her $350,000 condo. Assuming quite conservatively that it doubles in value in the decades to her age 90, it would have a theoretical street price of $700,000. If sold less five per cent for preparation and other costs, net $665,000. it would generate about $20,000 per year before tax with our three per cent return assumption. That would make her income including OAS and CPP $41,095 in 2019 dollars.\n\nIf Sally can stick to her present strict budget, which includes accelerating her mortgage payments for the next seven years, as she is doing, and then allocating at least half of the money that was going to the mortgage to her RRSP and TFSA when the mortgage is history, she can have her well-funded retirement and travel plans fulfilled, Einarson says.\n\nThe cost of illness before or after retirement is an unknown in these projections. Long-term care insurance could curb high costs. Sally could also extend the period between purchase of replacement vehicles in the next 20 years. Those controls would enable her to maintain her spending and reserves. Unexpected costs can be paid with the help of this additional saving.\n\n\u201cThe numbers in this analysis are modest, but it is clear that Sally can have the retirement security she wants if she continues to save diligently, to spend conservatively, and to keep her focus on the retirement goals of financial independence and security,\u201d Einarson says.\n\nRetirement stars: Four **** out of five\n\nFinancial Post\n\nE-mail andrew.allentuck@gmail.com for a free Family Finance analysis.", "description": "Sally forgoes travel now so she can save enough to go on one big vacation a year in retirement", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/fp0906-family-finance.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
