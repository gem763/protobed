The team won 38-0.\n\nJack's family said the eighth-grade student wanted to play football even while continuing to undergo treatment in his ongoing cancer fight. His doctors also gave him the OK to finally play.\n\n\"This isn't something that we're shoving down his throat,\" said Andy Hoffman, Jack's father, according to the Associated Press Thursday. \"Whether you have a brain tumor or not, you should make the most out of today. That's what Jack's doing.\"\n\nJack , of Atkinson, Nebraska, was first diagnosed with cancer at the age of 5 after he suffered a seizure in 2011.\n\nA Cornhusker fan, Jack attended his first game on his fifth birthday. Before his second brain surgery in September 2011, Jack's family reached out to the University of Nebraska and arranged for him to meet Burkhead and tour the stadium.\n\nIn April 2013, Jack, then 7, sported a specially sized Nebraska Cornhusker No. 22 uniform -- the number of his favorite player, Rex Burkhead -- and ran with the entire team for 69 yards to score the game's final touchdown.\n\nABC News\n\nDuring that meeting, Jack and Burkhead formed a friendship.\n\nThe White House/Flickr\n\nIn August 2014, when Jack was 8 years old, his family shared that his tumor was growing again after having been in remission.\n\nJack has spent the last few years fighting brain cancer and raising awareness about pediatric brain cancer along with his family as part of the Team Jack Foundation. His parents started the foundation in his honor, and it aims to raise money for pediatric brain cancer research. They have now raised more than $8 million.\n\nBurkhead now plays for the New England Patriots and is also a supporter of the foundation.\n\nAt age 7, Jack Hoffman warmed our hearts when he ran for a touchdown at the @Huskers spring game.\n\n\n\n6 years later, he's back on the field for his 1st school football game.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so proud of Jack and the work @TeamJack does to fight pediatric brain cancer. https://t.co/jNrqPer2QZ \u2014 Senator Deb Fischer (@SenatorFischer) September 17, 2019\n\nIn July 2013, Jack earned an ESPY award for \"Best Moment\" because of his touchdown video. He also had a chance to meet former President Barack Obama in the Oval Office in April 2013.\n\nABC News' Gillian Mohney and Katie Kindelan contributed to the reporting in this story.", "description": "A teen battling brain cancer is playing football for his junior high school; in 2013, he gained fame for scoring a 69-year touchdown with the Nebraska Cornhuskers.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/hoffman-01-as-ap-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
