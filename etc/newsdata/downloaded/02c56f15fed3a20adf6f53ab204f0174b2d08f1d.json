We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against a fellow American anymore.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke went on to argue that his gun confiscation plan enjoys the support of the majority of voters, including those who reside in traditionally red states.\n\n\u201cFolks who said, I would give that up, cut it to pieces, I don\u2019t need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself. It is a weapon of war, so, let\u2019s do the right thing, but let\u2019s bring everyone in America into the conversation,\u201d he said.\n\nHours before the debate, O\u2019Rourke urged major financial institutions not to finance gun transactions.\n\n\u201cHowever inadvertent or deliberate, credit card companies and banks profit off of those who terrorize our communities,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in an email to voters on Thursday. \u201cAnd we know that in this moment, no one can sit on the sidelines. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke released an ambitious gun control plan last month that would create a national gun registry, and ban assault-style rifles, bump-stocks, silencers, and magazines that hold more than ten rounds.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Beto O'Rourke vowed to confiscate legally owned rifles during the third Democratic primary debate on Thursday evening.Citing the recent mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, the former Democratic congressman said the federal government must seize certain semi-automatic rifles to prevent", "authors": ["Jack Crowe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EczUYp9kqA0QzzIORv2paA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/3c7e1a690f243c2defd475f9d7747559", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
