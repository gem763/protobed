As of the time of writing this article, the leading cryptocurrency is at $9,800 \u2014 up over $2,500, some 38%, in the past 36 hours. This is around $800 short of the daily high of $10,600.\n\nThis rally has gotten so out of hand that BitMEXRekt, a Twitter bot dedicated to updating Crypto Twitter to liquidations on its namesake platform, has crashed.\n\nBitcoin Up 40% on the Day\n\nAccording to Alex Kruger, Bitcoin, as the time of his tweet, was up 42% on the day. This purportedly represents the asset\u2019s fourth-largest gain in its history, and the largest since May 10th, 2011.\n\n$BTC has moved +42% today \u2013 4th largest gain in history and largest since May/10/2011 (if comparing against daily returns). \u2013 15th largest two-day gain in history, Nov/18/2013. Thank you China. President Xi is the true Crypto Dad. \u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger (@krugermacro) October 26, 2019\n\nSo, what caused this move?\n\nThe seeming catalysts vary from analyst to analyst.\n\nBut according to Gabor Gurbacs, who summarized the narratives well, there are three reasons why Bitcoin surged: 1) the latest CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures contract expired, something that has traditionally led to volatility, often in the upward direction; 2) President Xi Jinping of China revealed that he supports the development and adoption of blockchain technologies in China; and lastly 3) the chief executive of Crypto Capital, a firm offering financial services to industry companies including Bitfinex, was arrested, which Gurbarcs claims will allow clients of the firm to \u201cget some of [their] seized [money] back.\u201d\n\n3 reasons why #Bitcoin surged today:\n\n> CME Bitcoin futures expired today (4PM London time, last Friday of the month). > President Xi Jinping supports blockchain in China. > Crypto Capital CEO arrested. Exchanges, such as Bitfinex, may get some of the seized 850 million back. \u2014 Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) October 25, 2019\n\nSlight Reversal Possible\n\nWhile this is move is undeniably bullish, some are starting to expect a pullback. Popular analyst Nunya Bizniz pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s latest four-hour candle, which reached as high as $10,600 on BitMEX, is a \u201cperfected Tom Demark Sequential 9.\u201d\n\nBizniz notes that \u201ca TD 9 typically indicates trend exhaustion,\u201d implying that there may be some stagnation or a healthy pullback before a resumption of the uptrend.\n\nIndeed. He added that according to Tone Vays\u2019 take on the indicator, \u201cwe may see a one to four candle pullback (four to 16 hours) and then resume up.\u201d\n\nBTC 4hr: Current candle is a perfected TD9. A TD9 typically indicates trend exhaustion. However, It has occurred well above the TDST line (red dots). Which is a signal that the trend may continue. According to @ToneVays we may see a 1 to 4 candle pull back and then resume up. pic.twitter.com/BgtybbvcBi \u2014 Nunya Bizniz (@Pladizow) October 26, 2019\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "For now, Bitcoin (BTC) bulls seem to have decimated the bears.
