As the parishioners try to flee, the president fires at them. He shoots Black Lives Matter in the head...\u201d \u2066@nytmike\u2069 https://t.co/r6g789xkuR \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) October 14, 2019\n\nAmerican Priority did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. HuffPost has independently reviewed the footage, which circulated on Twitter Sunday evening, but has chosen not to link to it.\n\nIn the video \u2014 which features a modified clip from the 2014 film \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service\u201d \u2014 a man with Trump\u2019s superimposed face goes on a violent and bloody rampage inside what\u2019s called the \u201cChurch of Fake News.\u201d\n\nThe figure can be seen walking in the church as other people with logos over their heads from a bevy of news outlets \u2014 including PBS, NPR, HuffPost and The Washington Post \u2014 sit in the pews. The Trump-like figure then pulls out a gun and opens fire on the media outlets. Other fake versions of political and media figures are then attacked in the clip, including former FBI Director James Comey, MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and the late Arizona Sen. John McCain.\n\nA likeness of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a 2020 presidential candidate, later has his head lit on fire with a blow torch.\n\nAlex Phillips, the organizer of the event, told The New York Times that the video was \u201cnot associated with or endorsed by the conference in any official capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech,\u201d he said. \u201cThis matter is under review.\u201d\n\nAn image from the video that played as part of a \"meme exhibit\" at the event in Florida. (Photo: Twitter) More\n\nBoth Sarah Huckabee Sanders and a representative for Donald Trump Jr. told the Times they were not aware of the video and had not seen it at the event.\n\nThe video prompted immediate condemnation from many in the media on Sunday night. Jonathan Karl, president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, said the group was \u201chorrified\u201d by its contents and called on Trump to denounce the footage.\n\n\u201cAll Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President\u2019s political opponents,\u201d Karl said in a statement. \u201cWe have previously told the President his rhetoric could incite violence.\u201d\n\nCNN, which appeared in the video, said despite other anti-media memes that circulate on the internet, the clip shown at the conference was \u201cfar and away the worst.\u201d", "description": "The New York Times reports the video shows a fake Trump attacking versions of PBS and HuffPost, as well as a fake Sen.
