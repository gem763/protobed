The sides have failed even to set up lower-level negotiations on restarting talks.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is the impoverished North\u2019s desire for relief from harsh sanctions imposed as it has boosted its nuclear and missile capabilities. Washington, however, is demanding that Pyongyang first take more comprehensive steps to dismantle a nuclear program that has been painstakingly built over decades.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He also has trumpeted the strength of his relationship with Kim.\n\nTrump is the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader and the first to set foot on North Korean territory.\n\nAs he arrived at the U.N. for the start of the annual General Assembly of world leaders, Trump responded to a question about when he planned to meet with Kim, saying, \u201cIt could happen soon. It could happen soon.\u201d\n\nIn comments during a later meeting, Trump said of North Korean diplomacy: \u201cIt\u2019s moving along pretty well, actually.\u201d\n\nTrump was scheduled to meet later Monday with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the driving force behind the initial diplomacy that led to the first Trump-Kim summit last year and replaced threats of war in 2017.\n\nNorth Korea reportedly hasn\u2019t sent its top diplomat to the U.N. meetings, making the Moon-Trump talks potentially the highest-level diplomatic opportunity to make progress this week on the nuclear standoff.\n\nSpeaking Monday of that first summit with Kim, in Singapore, which critics have called more surface than substance, Trump said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t give that meeting as much credit as it deserves and the relationship we established. It was a tremendous success.\u201d\n\nOf Kim, he said they \u201creally got to know each other there.\u201d\n\nTrump is set to speak before the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, two years after he used that podium to deride Kim as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and to threaten to destroy North Korea.\n\nThe second Kim-Trump summit, in Hanoi, Vietnam, collapsed in February, then the leaders met briefly in June at the Korean border, where Trump unexpectedly stepped into the North and became the first American president to do so. Since then, there has been little apparent progress.\n\nIn recent days, however, North Korea has praised Trump for saying Washington may pursue an unspecified \u201cnew method\u201d in nuclear negotiations as well as for his decision to fire his hawkish former National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nNorth Korea also has hinted that some sort of diplomacy could soon resume, but it says it will not consider abandoning its nuclear weapons unless external threats are removed. The North says annual U.S.-South Korean military drills and the huge presence of American troops in the region are proof of U.S. hostility toward Pyongyang.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "President Donald Trump said Monday that a fourth summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"could happen soon\" as diplomacy has stalled.", "authors": ["Foster Klug"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19266593489811.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
