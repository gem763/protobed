He quit the job in 2018.\n\n\"Sometimes a slip of the tongue is not just a slip of the tongue. It's a slip of the mask,\" he said to host Chris Hall.\n\n\"I basically had to leave my dream job because of racist prejudices that went unacknowledged.\"\n\nAziz said that while he worked in the department, he heard staffers referring to certain communities as \"ethnic vote banks.\" He said he was assigned to \"brown files\" in the department \u2014 files dealing with non-white-majority countries \u2014 and was subjected to \"whitesplaining\" by colleagues who assumed he wasn't aware of certain cultural nuances because of his skin colour.\n\nTrudeau has been forced to answer uncomfortable questions all week after three instances of him wearing racist makeup as part of various costumes surfaced online.\n\nThe images span about a decade and a variety of situations, and show Trudeau in blackface both as a teenager and as an adult.\n\n\"What I did was inexcusable and wrong and hurt a lot of people who considered me to be an ally and that was wrong. And I am deeply, deeply sorry,\" Trudeau told a crowd in Saskatchewan Thursday.\n\nTrudeau has now publicly apologized twice \u2014 but he also has repeatedly declined to state how many times he may have worn blackface. He said he was \"wary of being definitive about this because of the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered.\"\n\nA former senior adviser in the Liberal government said Friday he wasn't surprised by photos of Justin Trudeau in blackface makeup because he encountered racially insensitive behaviour while working in the upper ranks of his government. 7:44\n\nBernier plans to debate Scheer, Trudeau on taxes, immigration and balancing the books\n\nPeople's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier speaks from a podium at an announcement in Toronto on June 21, 2019. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe leader of the People's Party of Canada says he will use his appearance in next month's English and French leaders' debates to challenge Andrew Scheer and Justin Trudeau on immigration, taxes and balancing the budget.\n\n\"These two are the same, so I will debate both of them,\" Maxime Bernier told The House.\n\nOn immigration, Bernier repeated his pledge to lower the total number of immigrants accepted into Canada to between 100,000 and 150,000. Under the Liberals, that number is expected to reach 350,000 annually by 2021.\n\nBernier said a PPC government would ensure there is a 50/50 balance between refugees and economic migrants, and bring back face-to-face interviews for people who want to come to this country to ensure they \"share our values.\"\n\nAmong the values he named when pressed by host Chris Hall were the separation between church and state, gender equality and a free market.\n\nBernier said he'd save $5 billion a year by cutting \"corporate welfare,\" including subsidies to major corporations. He's calling for a flat tax for all businesses at 10 per cent.\n\nBernier also said he'd cut foreign aid and balance the federal government's books in two years.\n\nIt's been just over a year since Maxime Bernier quit the Conservatives to create the People's Party of Canada. He has since moved the party from the margins of Canada's political scene to the national stage, an achievement cemented this week by an invitation to the French and English leaders' debates coming up in a few weeks. He joins Chris Hall for a feature interview. 8:41\n\nTrudeau's apology: Widespread acceptance or skepticism?\n\nLiberal candidate Gary Anandasangaree says he accepts the PM's apology. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe Liberal MP who chaired the parliamentary committee that consulted Canadians about a national anti-racism strategy said he accepts Justin Trudeau's repeated apologies for wearing blackface and other racist costumes.\n\n\"The key point is how do you address it after the fact and I think that's what the Prime Minister has done. He has shown leadership in saying, 'Yes that was me, it was an error, it was a mistake, I take responsibility for it.' He's not trying to appease anybody by trying to skate around the issue, he's very clear on the fact it's wrong. And, for me, that is enough,\" Gary Anandasangaree, who is currently seeking re-election in the Toronto-area riding of Scarborough-Rouge River, told The House.\n\nBut his support for Trudeau, which reflects how some people have responded to the controversy, including Canadians of colour, doesn't sit well with a pair of columnists who write about race and diversity issues.\n\nGary Anandasangaree led the government's charge to develop a national anti-racism strategy. So how does he feel about his leader appearing in blackface and brownface? And what impact will this have on his riding -- one of the most ethnically diverse in the country. 5:59\n\nOn Friday, the Liberal leader appeared in Toronto, flanked by his party's candidates in that city, many of who are visible minorities.\n\n\"I don't want to hear from his MPs. It's not for them to decide whether or not this is acceptable,\" said Erica Ifill, an opinion columnist for The Hill Times.\n\n\"I'm actually offended they think they can just just put some brown faces in front of Trudeau and say, 'Hey, it's Ok, there's nothing to see here.' That's reinforcing marginalization,\" Ifill said.\n\nShree Paradkar, who writes for the Toronto Star, said she was concerned the focus on Trudeau wearing blackface could take the public's attention away from larger, systemic racial barriers that affect many Canadians, including NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.\n\n\"Here is a rich white man who can just put on another culture and take it off when it's convenient, but his own rival not only cannot do that, but is discriminated for it and that is not a scandal,\" she said on The House.\n\n\"With this conversation, we're actually going a few steps back because now we're starting to say, 'What's racist about it? It's not just some ha-ha joke. It's what was used to justify lynchings, so there is a very serious background to blackface and nobody seems to be discussing that,\" Paradkar said.", "description": "This week on The House, we talk about Justin Trudeau's blackface photos with candidates, journalists and other experts.
