The stock closed down 2.3% amid broader losses in the restaurant sector.\n\nHere's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: $3.82, adjusted, vs. $3.22 expected\n\nRevenue: $1.4 billion vs. $1.4 billion expected\n\nSame-stores sales: 11% vs. 9.3% expected\n\nChipotle reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $98.6 million, or $3.47 per share, up from $38.2 million, or $1.36 per share a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, the chain earned $3.82 per share, topping the $3.22 per share expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\nNet sales rose 14.6% to $1.4 billion, meeting expectations of $1.4 billion. Digital sales grew 87.9% and accounted for nearly a fifth of Chipotle's sales this quarter.\n\nChipotle also announced changes to its plan for store openings. It is now forecasting that it could open fewer than 140 to 155 new stores in fiscal 2019. In 2020, the chain plans to open between 150 to 165 new locations, with more than half including a \"Chipotlane.\"\n\nThe company has been testing special drive-thrus for digital order pick-up. As a result of successful tests, the chain is now planning on putting Chipotlanes in half of its restaurants currently under construction. The longer time period associated with adding the drive-thru lanes to more than 40 restaurants means that some openings are expected to be delayed into 2020.", "description": "Chipotle's stock price has nearly doubled so far this year.", "authors": ["Amelia Lucas"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105488936-1538686494157img_8061.jpg?v=1549488754", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
