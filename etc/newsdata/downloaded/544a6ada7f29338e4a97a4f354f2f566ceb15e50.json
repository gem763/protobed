It\u2019s actually one of the questions we\u2019ve asked the strategic team to figure out.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s third-largest bank has seen business involving the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and its operations across 13 markets on the continent more than double this year, albeit from a small base, he said. The Johannesburg-based lender is aiming for multinational firms, such as Huawei, as part of an effort to boost revenue from the region by more than 10% as economic growth at home stutters.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time this year building out some of the Chinese speaking capability and delivery capability in some of our core markets - Kenya, Zambia, South Africa,\u201d Russon said. \u201cAs you establish some of those relationships in mainland China you have actually got to have people on the ground who can execute on it and service the client locally. Middle East and Asia are probably further behind.\u201d\n\nAbsa is not the only local lender chasing China. Larger rival Standard Bank [JSE:SBK], which is 20% owned by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, has said it plans to draw more of the $147bn a year of bilateral trade between Africa and China. FirstRand\u2019s Rand Merchant Bank has a representative office in Shanghai and has entered partnerships with several Chinese lenders, while Nedbank [JSE:NED] in 2013 agreed to cooperate with Bank of China.\n\nAbsa, which has a transactional banking relationship with Huawei in Africa, has already opened a representative office in London and is waiting for final regulatory approval to open in New York to better capture \u201cflows in and out of the continent,\u201d Russon said.\n\nIt is also considering ways to deepen its interests in African markets such as Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in discussions with our board on exactly where we want to go with our Nigeria strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are close to making some firm decisions on that.\u201d\n\nThe CIB division, which accounts for about a third of Absa\u2019s profit, will make one or two new hires in its mergers and acquisitions team, Russon said, without giving details.\n\n\u201cWe want a diversified portfolio across countries and businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a substantial CIB business that contributes in excess of 40% to group earnings, and not by shrinking other units.\u201d", "description": "Absa\u2019s corporate and investment banking unit plans to open an office in China as part of an expansion that will also target other parts of Asia and the Middle East.", "authors": ["Roxanne Henderson"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7651/3e2f22770eab485bbcd0400362dd9d93.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
