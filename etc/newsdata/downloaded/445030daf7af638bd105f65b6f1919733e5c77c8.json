He claimed that Wood \"can't adapt to cook vegan food\" and called his meal \"disappointing.\"\n\nWood once again chimed in to defend himself, but this time he used the WOOD Restaurant Group's Facebook account to respond.\n\n\n\n\"It's not a given that I should adapt my menu to suit your preference,\" he wrote. \"If you want vegan food go to a vegan restaurant....which incidentally if I went to one and asked for a steak I wouldn't get one. Nor would I expect to do so. Nor would I not recommend them for not giving me something I want. You ridiculous person.\"\n\nThis is far from the first vegan-related controversy to make headlines recently. Just this week, a woman said she had been \"poisoned for life\" after she was accidentally served a sausage roll rather than a vegan substitute at Greggs, a UK bakery chain. Meanwhile, back in June, PETA referred to Arby's as stuck in \"the Stone Age\" after the sandwich chain rolled out its \"megetable\" - a carrot made of turkey - to take a jab at vegan \"meat.\"\n\n\n\nIn September, a group of vegans tried to stop shoppers from buying meat at a New Zealand supermarket by holding signs and chanting. That same month, a vegan woman in Australia sued her neighbours for barbecuing meat in their backyard.\n\nWood, McCormick, and Norris did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "Simon Wood, who won \"Masterchef\" in the UK in 2015, called one customer a \"d---\" after they criticized the chef's handling of vegan customers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2830/7ed6ade3c9f94cfcb1a0d04811982c06.jpg"}
