How sad is that? I am still single. Isn't it insane?'\n\nSingle ladies: Love Island's Anna Vakili, Francesca Allen, Yewande Biala, Joanna Chimonides and Amy Hart say the show has destroyed their love lives\n\nJoanna admitted: 'It is harder to meet someone now. I didn't think it would be but it is.'\n\nEx-pharmacist Anna, 29, has revealed she receives more attention from women than she does men and fears she could be growing 'too old' for the dating scene.\n\nShe added: 'I'm still single. It was easier to date before Love Island. I get more attention from women at the moment! At most of these events it's all women. Maybe I'm getting old? My age is creeping up on me.'\n\nWhereas Joanna, 22, has been put off dating by potential suitors 'sliding into her DMs' and dreads being associated with the same person after only seeing them once.\n\n'How sad is that?': Former scientist Yewande Biala despaired: 'How is it possible we all went on a show to find love and we\u2019ve come out more single?'\n\nSingleton: Joanna Chimonides has revealed she finds 'it harder to meet someone' since finding fame on the dating series\n\nShe said: 'You know when people slide into your DMs? I don't know their personality, I don't know who they are, and I prefer to meet people out and about.\n\n'I'm so single. It is harder to meet someone. I didn't think it would be but it is. I don't really go on dates.\n\n'You might meet someone who's not in the public eye and you can't go on a date with them if they don't want to be photographed. You'll end up sitting at home and then there's the pressure to have sex!\n\n'Then you might date someone who's in the public eye for a day and never go on a second date with them but the next thing you know you're associated with them for a long, long time.'\n\n'Maybe I\u2019m getting old?' Anna Vakili, who briefly dated Jordan Hames in the villa, said she receives more attention from women and fears she could be growing 'too old' for dating\n\nSingle and ready to mingle! Amy Hart hoped 'going on Love Island would solve all my problems' but the ex-air stewardess still doesn't have time for the opposite sex\n\nAmy, 26, who quit the show to give Curtis Pritchard the chance to move on with Maura Higgins, hoped trading in her life as an air stewardess and starring on Love Island would help her to bag her first boyfriend.\n\nShe said: 'I thought going on Love Island would solve all of my problems.\n\n'When I used to date before I couldn't manage a relationship because I would always be away and I lived out of a suitcase \u2013 I never had any order or routine but now it's worse! I'm still single. I don't have the time.'\n\nBoutique owner Francesca, 23, says she feels some men are too intimidated to approach her at parties \u2013 but after years of being in relationships she's learned to be content on her own.\n\nShe said: 'You go out and you'll see guys and they look at you because maybe they recognise you \u2013 but then they're shyer. I'm not going to meet anyone at an event!\n\n'I'm still single but I was always in a relationship prior to going on Love Island. I feel like now after being on the show that I've got much more confidence and I feel it is OK for me to be myself. I'm quite content with being on my own.'\n\nBusy bee: Boutique owner Francesca Allen says she's learned to be 'more confident' since leaving the villa and she's enjoying being on her own\n\nThe Love Island stars have joined forces with clothing brand In The Style for #ThePowerEdit campaign.\n\nEach of the girls have worked together with the online retailer to launch their own partywear edits, which aim to showcase their individual styles.\n\nAmy said working with Adam Frisby's In The Style was a 'dream come true' and she 'cried her eyes out' after being offered the deal.\n\nShe told MailOnline: 'I've shopped at In The Style for years and years. I have been offered other clothing ranges when I came out the villa but none of them fitted me \u2013 I wasn't just going to take a clothing range for the sake of it.\n\n'So when the email came through I cried my eyes out. I used to spend all my wages on In The Style so I feel like I'm just getting the money back that I've spent over the years!'", "description": "Love Island's hottest female stars have revealed how appearing on the ITV2 series has destroyed their love lives.
