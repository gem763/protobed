These controllers are often found in factories and other industrial environments and can be used to help with managing equipment remotely.\n\nResearchers also note that posts on gas pump hacking also frequently appear in Portuguese language forums, even featuring an in-depth, step-by-step technical tutorial on how to hack gas pumps for Brazilian users. In one case, a user demonstrates how they were able to remotely change the name of a pump.\n\nSEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\n\nWhile it's possible that these attacks are being discussed for similar reasons to those on smart meters \u2013 to receive resources at a cheaper price \u2013 it's entirely possible that gas pumps could be compromised for more destructive purposes.\n\nLike any unsecured connected device, there's the possibility that internet-facing gas pumps could be roped into botnets for use in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, with attackers using them to help overload online services.\n\n\n\nHowever, a previous Trend Micro report outlines how remotely accessible and unsecured gas pumps could be abused by hackers to cause errors or physical damage \u2013 and the rise in interest in gas pumps could mean that attacks like this are on the way.\n\n\"There are a number of additional threat scenarios that could possibly play out. This includes reconnaissance to find out the delivery schedule, extortion that involves blocking the owner's access in exchange for a certain sum, and even sabotaging the gas pump by adjusting tank limits so that it overflows,\" Bharat Mistry, principal security strategist at Trend Micro told ZDNet.\n\nThe report also warns that IoT attacks remain in their early stages and with billions more devices expected to enter homes and workplaces over the coming years \u2013 especially as 5G helps provide faster, more reliable connections for devices \u2013 cyber criminals will increasingly turn to IoT as a means of attack.\n\nHowever, there are ways to help protect gas pumps and similar devices, even if they're connected to the internet, including ensuring that devices have their default passwords changed, so brute-force attacks aren't as effective.\n\n\"Operators of these devices should also think about using features such as VPNs to encrypt the traffic, and mutual authentication whereby both the device and the user validate one other before continuing,\" said Mistry.\n\n\"That's not to mention, software must continuously be updated and patched, and operators should always have a manual override at the ready in case of a compromised machine,\" he added.\n\nREAD MORE ON CYBERSECURITY\n\n\n\n", "description": "As more and more devices get connected to the Internet of Things, researchers say compromising pumps has become a hot topic on cyber criminal forums.", "authors": ["Danny Palmer"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/890c9ef9-b926-4e31-b9a4-c5d693a411e1/thumbnail/770x578/e17c879a25a9ace8d6ca6a99e6db6477/istock-958075586.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
