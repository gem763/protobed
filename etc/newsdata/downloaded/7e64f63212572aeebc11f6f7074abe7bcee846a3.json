(Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nThe next acting chief of the U.S. Park Police is accused in a new complaint by the Fraternal Order of Police of arranging for criminal charges to be dismissed against defendants in San Francisco, including some reportedly drunken employees of the Presidio Trust who allegedly assaulted Park Police officers.\n\nGregory T. Monahan, 47, has been the assistant chief in charge of the San Francisco field office, but he is based at the Park Police\u2019s Washington headquarters. He is set to become acting chief of the Park Police next week when Chief Robert MacLean takes over the Interior Department\u2019s Office of Law Enforcement and Security, which oversees law enforcement, security and intelligence activities for seven federal agencies, including the Park Police. MacLean\u2019s last day was Friday.\n\n[Park Police Chief Robert MacLean promoted to top Interior Dept. law enforcement post]\n\nThe complaint filed Friday by Michael E. Shalton Jr., the chairman of the Park Police chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, alleges that on two occasions, people he identified as employees of the Presidio Trust in San Francisco were arrested and charged but that the head of the trust then contacted Monahan. Shalton said Monahan in turn contacted an assistant federal prosecutor in San Francisco, Denise Oki, who then dismissed all charges in both cases. Shalton provided emails to The Washington Post to back up his complaint, but some information was redacted.\n\nThe Presidio Trust is a federal agency that helps fund the Park Police in San Francisco through a partnership between the National Park Service and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. Jean S. Fraser, the trust\u2019s chief executive, who is accused by Shalton of asking Monahan to dismiss the charges against her employees, declined to comment Friday.\n\nMonahan also declined to comment. Oki did not respond to emails seeking a response.\n\nThe deputy U.S. attorney in San Francisco, Joshua Eaton, issued a statement that confirmed that Oki did dismiss the charges \u201cat the request of the agency that issued them.\u201d Eaton said that \u201can agency request to dismiss a citation is not, in itself, improper\u201d and that prosecutors had \u201cno reason to believe that anyone in this office understood the requests referred to in the FOP\u2019s letter were improper.\u201d Eaton said that an independent review of the allegations would be conducted.\n\n\u201cWe need a congressional investigation of the Park Police,\u201d Shalton said in an interview. Shalton said he had written a ticket to a superior officer in the Washington area recently and that a captain \u201cmade sure the ticket was not turned in.\u201d The Park Police have about 500 uniformed officers in Washington, New York and San Francisco.\n\nShalton filed his complaint to the Office of Special Counsel on a \u201cReport Government Wrongdoing\u201d form, and also sent a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr asking him to investigate \u201cinterference with the criminal justice system\u201d by Park Police managers and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Northern California. \u201cFOP members go out and make arrests every day, risking their lives,\u201d Shalton wrote to the attorney general, \u201cand should not have to put up with a situation where a senior manager is able to have serious criminal and traffic matters dismissed by prosecutors just because he asks or does not like the optics of a situation.\u201d\n\nShalton\u2019s \u201coptics\u201d reference came from an email apparently sent from a Park Police official \u2014 whose name was redacted \u2014 to Oki in March 2018, after an episode at a bowling alley on the Presidio. Four Presidio Trust employees \u201cwere significantly intoxicated\u201d and refused to leave the alley, Shalton wrote, and when Park Police officers arrived, two of the employees pushed or grabbed officers. Ten misdemeanor charges were filed against the four employees, including resisting arrest against three of them, according to Shalton.\n\nThe email to Oki, included with Shalton\u2019s letter to Barr, states, \u201cAfter consultation with Deputy Chief Gregory Monahan on today\u2019s date, the U.S. Park Police is requesting that your office dismiss these tickets based on the timeliness of the issuance of the notice to appear in court and the optics connected to the personnel complaint.\u201d Shalton said that the tickets were filed immediately, as required, and that at least one of the employees had filed a complaint against the officers in an attempt to get the charge quashed. Oki responded, \u201cI will dismiss these citations per the agency\u2019s request,\u201d the emails show.\n\nIn a second incident, from March of last year, Park Police were called to check out an alarm at the Presidio golf course and encountered two employees who the officers believed were drunk. When the employees allegedly became belligerent and refused to provide identification, they were charged with failure to obey lawful orders.\n\nShalton submitted emails that show Oki again agreed to dismiss the charges and another email stating that \u201cMonahan had called Denise to take care of tickets.\u201d Shalton\u2019s complaint says a mid-level commander objected to the case dismissals and was overruled by Monahan.\n\n\u201cThe CEO of the Presidio Trust goes directly to Monahan any time her employees need help,\u201d Shalton said. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting, and it needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\n[Video shows Park Police fired nine shots into Bijan Ghaisar's Jeep at close range, killing him]\n\nThe Park Police have also come under fire for their lack of transparency in the November 2017 slaying of unarmed motorist Bijan Ghaisar. Park Police officers Alejandro Amaya and Lucas Vinyard shot at Ghaisar as he sat behind the wheel of his Jeep Grand Cherokee, slowly driving away from them. MacLean declined to identify the officers or provide any information about the incident. A Fairfax County police officer recorded the incident on his in-car video camera, and Fairfax Police Chief Edwin C. Roessler Jr. released the tape in 2018, over federal objections, and later provided the officers\u2019 names to the Ghaisar family as part of their lawsuit in the case. No decision has been made by the Justice Department or U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu of the District about whether to file charges in the case.\n\nJustice Department officials declined to comment on Shalton\u2019s complaint Friday.", "description": "A Fraternal Order of Police official said that when Presidio Trust employees were arrested, their CEO called the Park Police official, who told federal prosecutors to drop the charges.", "authors": ["Tom Jackman", "Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e9fAp_WEJMT7WDNzZlj4ucmFLAY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HKRM3BE6F4I6RI65FIMZD4DV2U.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
