REUTERS/Maria Alejandra Cardona\n\nFarah, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, worked from 2011 to 2017 with Salazar, who was given a four-year ban by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) on Sept. 30.\n\nThe 36-year-old Farah, speaking for the first time since Salazar was suspended, responded angrily to questions about his former mentor, with whom he achieved some of his best performances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to see you guys going at it again and again, and headlines, \u2018Farah, Farah, Farah\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just say there\u2019s no allegation against me. I\u2019ve not done anything wrong.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you guys and talk to you guys and be nice to you, you\u2019ll still be negative. If I don\u2019t talk to you, you\u2019ll still be negative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware I can\u2019t win. You\u2019re already made up your mind what you\u2019re going to write \u2013- that is a fact.\u201d\n\nAsked if he regretted staying with Salazar, particularly after a 2015 BBC documentary made a series of allegations against the American, Farah said he had confronted his coach.\n\n\u201cI was out in Birmingham (England) racing, I pulled out (of) the race in 2015,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI wanted some answers and I flew to Portland to get some answers from Alberto.\n\n\u201cTalked to him face-to-face and he assured me at the time, \u2018These are just allegations. This is not true. There are no allegations against you, Mo.\u2019 He promised me. And that hasn\u2019t been true.\u201d\n\nFARAH UNAWARE\n\nFarah, who won Olympic gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres at the 2012 and 2016 Games, said he was unaware until after the ban was announced that Salazar was charged with doping in 2017.\n\nSalazar has denied any wrongdoing and said he plans to appeal against the suspension.\n\nDefending Chicago marathon champion Farah and 2017 winner American Galen Rupp plus women\u2019s marathon runner Jordan Hasay are among Salazar\u2019s most decorated athletes.\n\nNike announced on Thursday that it would shut down the Nike Oregon Project, the elite programme overseen by Salazar, where Rupp and Hasay trained.\n\nNeither Rupp nor Hasay has been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe 33-year-old Rupp, who missed the Spring marathon season due to surgery, deflected questions about Salazar, saying he had had no \u201cprofessional\u201d contact with his long-time coach since the announcement of the suspension.\n\nHasay, who like Rupp was coached by Salazar until the suspension, said she was \u201cvery, very close\u201d to her coach and it was hard not speaking with him in the days before Sunday\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cI trust what I know and what I\u2019ve seen and I\u2019ve never been offered anything or seen anything,\u201d Hasay said. \u201cIf that were to happen I would have left long ago.\u201d\n\nIn the days leading up to the Chicago Marathon, race director Carey Pinkowski said he viewed the Salazar announcement as \u201can opportunity to move forward\u201d.\n\nPaula Radcliffe, a Nike ambassador who holds the world record for the women\u2019s marathon, told Reuters the sport still needed to work to clean up competition.\n\n\u201cMy issue is this isn\u2019t the battle won,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the battle far from won.\u201d", "description": "British Olympic champion Mo Farah defended his reputation at a news conference ahead of the Chicago Marathon on Friday after being bombarded with questions about his former coach Alberto Salazar who has been banned for doping violations.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439861078&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A27F", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
