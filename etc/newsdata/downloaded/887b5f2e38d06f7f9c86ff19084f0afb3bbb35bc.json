The Ukrainian president went on to suggest his country may soon buy more antitank missiles from the United States. \u201cWe are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defence purposes,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Trump replied: \u201cI would like you to do us a favour because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\u201d\n\nHe then asked for help in finding the Democratic National Committee computer server that US officials say was hacked by Russian intelligence in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nMr Trump also called special counsel Robert Mueller III \u201cincompetent\u201d for his performance a day earlier while testifying to congress about his investigation into Russian interference in the US presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it,\u201d Mr Trump says according to the memo. \u201cI would like to have the attorney general call you or your people, and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nMr Trump repeatedly said Mr Zelensky should work with William Barr, the US attorney general, or Mr Giuliani. The latter had separately pressed Ukrainian officials for a Biden inquiry.\n\n\u201cI would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Mr Trump said, according to the White House memo which was declassified on Tuesday.\n\nAs the half-hour conversation went on, Mr Trump\u2019s requests of Ukraine\u2019s president shifted to a different topic: investigating the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d Mr Trump said, according to the memo. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nMr Zelensky replied that \u201cmy candidate\u201d for the prosecutor job \u201cwill look into the situation\u201d. He also noted he stayed at Trump Tower on his last visit to New York City, Mr Trump invites him for a White House meeting \u2013 something the Ukrainian leader had wanted.\n\n\u201cWhenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call,\u201d Mr Trump said, according to the White House\u2019s rough transcript.\n\nSince Mr Zelensky\u2019s election in April, Ukraine had urgently sought a meeting for the new president at the White House, a sit-down to demonstrate Washington\u2019s backing as it fights a long-simmering war with Russian-backed separatists. US officials and members of the Trump administration wanted the meeting to go ahead, but Mr Trump personally rejected efforts to set it up, The Washington Post reported last week.\n\nThe White House has not yet set a date for an Oval Office meeting.\n\nWhile the Justice Department has concluded the call did not violate campaign finance law, Democrats say the president\u2019s conduct endangered national security. Congressman Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said the call \u201creads like a classic mob shakedown\u201d.\n\nAt a news conference later in New York, Mr Trump savaged Mr Schiff, Democrats, and the media.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a hoax, folks, it\u2019s all a big hoax,\u201d the president said. \u201cWhen you look at the information, it\u2019s a joke. Impeachment for that? When you have a wonderful meeting or a wonderful phone conversation.\u201d\n\nThe transcript of the call reads like a classic mob shakedown:\n\n\n\n\u2013 We do a lot for Ukraine\n\n\u2013 There\u2019s not much reciprocity\n\n\u2013 I have a favor to ask\n\n\u2013 Investigate my opponent\n\n\u2013 My people will be in touch\n\n\n\nNice country you got there.\n\n\n\nIt would be a shame if something happened to her. \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 25, 2019\n\nMr Trump denied any wrongdoing and suggested the Biden family deserved to be investigated for possible corruption, making unsubstantiated allegations they have taken millions of dollars out of China. He insisted his hands were clean.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it, I didn\u2019t threaten anyone,\u201d the president said. \u201cNo push, no pressure, no nothing.\u201d\n\nOfficials are preparing to declassify a version of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and make it public later this week.\n\nWhite House officials said the call memo does not show the president seeking any quid pro quo to kneecap a political rival because the president did not tie his requests to aid from the US government.\n\nWhile political fights surrounding the phone call have raged for the last 10 days, government officials at a host of agencies have been privately dealing with the matter for more than a month.\n\nSenior officials said the director of national intelligence referred concerns about the call to the Justice Department in late August, after the intelligence community inspector general found that it was a possible violation of campaign finance laws. Days later, the inspector general referred the matter to the FBI.\n\nCareer prosecutors and officials in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division reviewed the rough transcript, which they obtained voluntarily from the White House, and determined the facts \u201ccould not make\u201d the appropriate basis for an investigation, a senior Justice Department official said on Wednesday.\n\nThe final decision was made by Brian Benczkowski, who leads the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division. As part of their reasoning, Justice Department lawyers determined that help with a government investigation could not be quantified as \u201ca thing of value\u201d under the law, officials said.\n\nTheir primary source for reaching that conclusion was the memo, according to the officials. While prosecutors did gather information about how the White House memorialises presidential calls with foreign heads of state, they did not interview other White House officials because they had not formally opened an investigation. Justice Department officials still do not know who the whistleblower is, officials said on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division \u201creviewed the official record of the call and determined, based on the facts and applicable law, that there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was warranted\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll relevant components of the Department agreed with this legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,\u201d Ms Kupec said.\n\nMs Kupec also said Mr Trump had never spoken with Mr Barr \u201cabout having Ukraine investigate anything related to the former vice president, Joe Biden, or his son,\u201d nor had Mr Barr talked about \u201canything related to Ukraine\u201d with Mr Giuliani.\n\nWill the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call \u2013 got them by surprise! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019\n\nShe noted that US Attorney John Durham, who is exploring the origins of the FBI\u2019s probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, was \u201cexploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election\u201d.\n\nThe US president ordered the memo released following days of mounting pressure from congress, and a new surge of Democrats who favour impeachment.\n\nWhite House officials said there were discussions for several days about releasing details of the call, with Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, objecting to its release on the grounds that doing so would make it harder for Mr Trump to speak frankly with foreign leaders, and senior Justice Department officials urging it be made public to quell the growing debate over Mr Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nMr Trump has acknowledged publicly that he asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Mr Biden\u2019s son, who served on the board of a Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that came under scrutiny by authorities there. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.\n\nAs vice president, Joe Biden, now considered a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in 2020, pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor., whom Mr Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.\n\nAt the time, the Ukrainians\u2019 investigation was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and US officials.\n\nInitially, the parameters of the whistleblower allegations were mysterious. Though whistleblower complaints to the intelligence community inspector general are often forwarded to the intelligence committees in congress, the Justice Department determined this one should not be provided to lawmakers for their review.\n\nJustice Department officials released their legal reasoning for doing so on Wednesday, asserting that because the matter did not concern the \u201cfunding, administration, or operation of an intelligence community\u201d matter \u2013 but instead was an allegation of possible criminal conduct by the commander in chief \u2013 it should be more properly handled as a criminal referral.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel also noted the inspector general had found \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favour of a rival political candidate\u201d.\n\nLawmakers have raised concerns about Trump\u2019s directive to freeze nearly $400m (\u00a3320m) in military assistance for Ukraine in the days leading up the phone call with Mr Zelensky.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, announced she was launching a formal impeachment inquiry, saying \u201cthe actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonourable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\nThe rapidly-escalating confrontation between the White House and congress comes just months after Mr Trump freed himself from the cloud of the investigation led by M Mueller. Now, he is back in the crosshairs of a resurgent impeachment effort over a fresh allegation of election season misconduct.\n\nOne senior White House official said that while the call summary was \u201cnot entirely helpful for our side\u201d, it also showed there was not an explicit quid pro quo \u2013 which could be a crime.\n\n\u201cEveryone is going to see in that transcript what they want to see,\u201d this person said, adding there were robust discussions about whether it would help or hurt Mr Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nRead more\n\nRead more The one sentence in the Ukraine call that could bring Trump down\n\nWhat we can expect to happen next in the Trump impeachment drama\n\nContents of Ukraine whistleblower complaint \u2018deeply disturbing\u2019", "description": "Donald Trump repeatedly urged the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, one of his chief political rivals, and offered to enlist the US attorney general in that effort while dangling the possibility of inviting the foreign leader to the White House, according to a rough transcript of the call", "authors": ["Devlin Barrett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s9RpEW.Rxu89kNnm1BARWQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/cbc464ba39e72b0bb4e0413ab9eff0d9", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
