The effort to secure that meeting began the same day the prosecutor\u2019s firing was announced.\n\nIn addition, Burisma\u2019s American team offered to introduce Ukrainian prosecutors to Obama administration officials to make amends, according to that memo and the American legal team\u2019s internal emails.\n\nThe memos raise troubling questions:\n\n1.) If the Ukraine prosecutor\u2019s firing involved only his alleged corruption and ineptitude, why did Burisma\u2019s American legal team refer to those allegations as \u201cfalse information?\u201d\n\n2.) If the firing had nothing to do with the Burisma case, as Biden has adamantly claimed, why would Burisma\u2019s American lawyers contact the replacement prosecutor within hours of the termination and urgently seek a meeting in Ukraine to discuss the case?", "description": "", "authors": ["John Solomon", "Thehill.Com Opinion Campaign"], "top_image": ""}
