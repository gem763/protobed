A Farm Manager Doubts It.", "language": "en", "text": "Vice President Mike Pence claimed on Friday to have once been bitten by the famous Triple Crown-winning horse American Pharoah, turning the amusing anecdote into an allegory for the rough-and-tumble world of politics, but it may have been a tall tale.\n\nDuring a speech at a policy retreat for House Republicans in Baltimore, Pence recalled his alleged close encounter at a Kentucky farm where the horse was being housed, prompting laughter from the audience when he said it \u201cbit me so hard on the arm, I almost collapsed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just gritted my teeth and smiled, because you know what? In our line of work, you\u2019re going to get bit sometimes, but you keep fighting forward. And we did.\u201d\n\nThe story was met with applause, but for one man who was present during Pence\u2019s 2018 visit, during which the vice president was given one of the horse\u2019s halters, it didn\u2019t ring true.\n\nDermot Ryan, manager of Ashford Stud in Versailles, a city in the state\u2019s northeastern region just outside of Lexington, told the McClatchy news group that he would have been aware if something went awry.\n\n\u201cIf he gave someone a nasty bite, I\u2019d know it,\u201d he said, adding that the farm was \u201cvery honored\u201d by Pence\u2019s visit and that the vice president was \u201cvery pleasant.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report from The Spectator\u2019s U.S. edition, it wasn\u2019t the first time Pence told the story. During his return to Kentucky in May, he told a crowd at the Governor\u2019s Derby Eve Gala that the horse \u201cbit me so hard, it left a mark and I show it to people the whole time.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s deputy press secretary, Darin Miller, told HuffPost that Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) \u201cwas there and has verified that he saw the bruise after.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from Barr\u2019s then told HuffPost, \u201cI can confirm for you that the bite occurred while VP Pence was in Kentucky campaigning for Rep. Barr. The Vice President did show the bruise to Rep. Barr on Air Force 2 on their way back to DC.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with Miller\u2019s response and a statement from Barr\u2019s office.", "description": "The vice president shared the anecdote about American Pharoah during a Baltimore policy retreat, but not everyone's buying it.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7cf2fc2300001c055392a1.jpeg?cache=buww2uwwnb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
