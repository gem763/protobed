Now 71, he likes to use his celebrity to educate his fellow baby boomers on the importance of taking care of themselves. Bradshaw has been a health advocate for many illnesses and he\u2019s currently teaming up with Pfizer PFE, +0.49% to educate people about pneumococcal pneumonia, an infection caused by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. It\u2019s a disease that kills thousands of people a year over the age of 65.\n\n\u201cI got into bourbon because I love bourbon, but my preacher doesn\u2019t know that I drink bourbon.\u201d\n\nIn our interview, the famously talkative Bradshaw started by saying I should grow back my \u201csweet beard\u201d \u2014 he must have Googled me \u2014 before talking about, among other topics, why he flips planes and why losing $900,000 ended up being the best financial move he ever made.\n\nMarketWatch: Tell me about the project you\u2019re working on with Pfizer.\n\nTerry Bradshaw: I am doing this with Pfizer because it\u2019s so important for all of us as we get older to take care of ourselves. Pneumococcal pneumonia is just a disease that slips in and if you don\u2019t take care of yourself, my friend, you\u2019re gonna die. I work out now more than I have ever in my life. I\u2019m 6 inches bigger in my chest than I was when I played professional football. My legs are bigger, my calves are bigger. Men historically just flat don\u2019t want to go to a doctor, probably because we are scared of what they\u2019ll tell us. I\u2019m not one of those, I go. I want to know that I\u2019m healthy on the inside so I can enjoy all of the things on the outside. I got grandkids, I got horses to ride, I got cattle, I love to fish, I love to travel.\n\nMarketWatch: You\u2019re Terry freaking Bradshaw, you only have so much time to spend on any project you want. Why was this one in particular important to put your name on?\n\nBradshaw: I\u2019m 71 years old. I\u2019m not getting younger. I\u2019ve experienced a great deal of health changes over my life. Professional athletes especially suffer from many different kinds of injuries, so health is of utmost importance. I haven\u2019t ever asked Pfizer why they asked me to be a part of this, but I think they are glad that they did. We have had fun doing it.\n\nMarketWatch: You\u2019ve been an active promoter of shingles care in the past so it seems like people trust you as a spokesman.\n\nBradshaw: I don\u2019t get involved in things for money, I just don\u2019t. If you and I were having a beer, I would tell you about all the stuff I turn down. I had shingles when I was 27. They wanted a football player in the ad, and they got me.\n\n\u201cI buy a lot of planes. You have to be smart when you buy one. You have to use it for business. Then I learned how to flip a plane. You spend $4 or $5 million bucks and it might scare the heck out of you, but not me.\u201d\n\nMarketWatch: As a former Steelers QB, what did you think of Steelers QB Ben Rothlisberger going down with an injury this weekend, and where do you see Pittsburgh\u2019s season going now?\n\nBradshaw: They lose Ben and the backup is this kid Mason Rudolph out of Oklahoma State. He played pretty well \u2014 had a couple of touchdown passes. I feel bad for Ben. He tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow which is the same ligament that I tore that ended my career, so it\u2019ll be interesting. I wish him well. Plus Eli Manning gets benched in New York and then Drew Brees gets hurt with a thumb injury.\n\nMarketWatch: All these quarterbacks are going down.\n\nBradshaw: I might have to come out of retirement at 71 (laughs).\n\nMarketWatch: You have been outspoken about [former Steelers wide receiver] Antonio Brown in the past. What are your thoughts on his situation right now?\n\nBradshaw: I am right where I want to be, as far away from him as I can be. I don\u2019t like guys like that. I don\u2019t want to play with guys like that. As far as I am concerned he\u2019s a selfish, immature player. I\u2019m disappointed in New England for picking him up. I\u2019m disappointed he could last in the league this long but I guess if you have talent you can be rewarded for bad behavior. It\u2019s not the way I was raised.\n\nMarketWatch :When you were playing, teams would run the ball a lot more than they do today. But you actually stood out because you and the Steelers were more of an air-raid attack than most teams at the time. What do you think the next innovation in football is going to be?\n\nBradshaw: It\u2019s going to be passing because running the football is becoming a dinosaur. Now teams want to throw 50 times. I wasn\u2019t a big supporter of this Kyler Murray [first overall NFL draft pick in 2019] and Kliff Kingsbury [first year NFL head coach] deal out there in Arizona but I got to tell you man (laughs) it\u2019s got my attention!\n\nMarketWatch: What\u2019s the best financial advice you\u2019ve ever been given.\n\nBradshaw: Make sure the people you have are the most qualified people. I\u2019m smart enough to know that there are people a lot smarter in finance than I am. My father always told me to invest in things that I know. So I invest heavily in real estate, horses and cattle.I don\u2019t want to get \u201crich rich rich,\u201d I want to be smart with my money, I\u2019m conservative by nature. I have a clothing line coming out, and I have a whisky coming out this Christmas. I have gotten involved with things that I know about. I got into bourbon because I love bourbon, but my preacher doesn\u2019t know that I drink bourbon.\n\nMarketWatch: Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll edit that part out. What\u2019s one thing you don\u2019t mind spending money on?\n\nBradshaw: Planes. I buy a lot of planes, I\u2019ve owned a lot of jets. You have to be smart when you buy one. You have to use it for business. Then I learned how to flip a plane. I learned how long to use it and when you need to move it. As a matter of fact, I just bought one while we were on the phone! I have been at this a long time and jets don\u2019t scare me at all. You spend 4 or 5 million bucks and it might scare the heck out of you, but not me.\n\nMarketWatch: What\u2019s your favorite possession?\n\nBradshaw: My conscience. Man, that is heavy. Make sure you right that down. That just popped out of my mouth (laughs).\n\nMarketWatch: Have you made any big money mistakes?\n\nBradshaw: I lost $900,000 in real estate right when the recession hit. I was heavily invested, about 13 million bucks to be exact. I came home one day and I just didn\u2019t feel good, I was kind of sick to my stomach. I felt nervous about what was going on in the money markets and I asked a friend to help me out. In 3 days, I sold all of my property in Texas, Oklahoma and Mexico. I lost $900K. I got a call from Merrill Lynch telling me that\u2019s the smartest investment decision I had ever made because the recession was about to come. I lost a lot, but it could have been a lot worse.", "description": "The NFL Hall of Famer spoke with MarketWatch about why losing $900,000 ended up being the best financial move he ever made, and why he spends so much time...", "authors": ["Weston Blasi"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR750_terryb_ZG_20190920111931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
