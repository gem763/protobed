The national media are going to latch onto and amplify all the ways in which Americans disagree with one another.\n\nThis is the last thing Americans need to hear. Especially now, as we approach a vitally important election, we need to break out of echo chambers and start listening to one another. Importantly, we need facts and real debate over ideology and ranting.\n\nThis is the topic of my latest \u201cNewt\u2019s World\u201d podcast episode \u2013 and my daughter Jackie Gingrich Cushman\u2019s upcoming book \u201cOur Broken America: Why Both Sides Need to Stop Ranting and Start Listening\u201d.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: DEM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DOING A GREAT JOB SHOWING VOTERS WHY TRUMP SHOULD BE REELECTED\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nJackie\u2019s insights have come out of a lifetime of volunteerism and dedication to civic duty. They also come from growing up as my daughter. As you can imagine, she has plenty of firsthand experience dealing with the side-effects of political polarization.\n\nFor example, in our conversation, Jackie talks about being a young student and having administrators and others approach her to tell her how glad they that I had lost one of my early elections. In her book, she describes instances of my other daughter being denied jobs because of her relation to me.\n\nThis isn\u2019t how America is supposed to work. America is supposed to be a bastion of free speech, debate, and the sharing of ideas. Real debate isn\u2019t about two sides shouting at one another. It is about two (or more) sides coming together to share and absorb facts and ideas.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUltimately, Jackie wrote this book because she is concerned about the direction or our country \u2013 and the future that her children may face living in it.\n\nI hope you will listen to this week\u2019s episode and help promote real debate to bridge our nation\u2019s divides.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "Americans need to start listening to each other and stop ranting.", "authors": ["Newt Gingrich", "Former Speaker Of The U.S. House Of Representatives Newt Gingrich Is The Host Of The"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/Newt-Gingrich-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
