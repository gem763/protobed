You can\u2019t throw a stone without hitting a new adaptation of the author\u2019s work, and the next one on deck is The Outsiders. Based on the novel by King, this HBO miniseries will unpack the murder of a young boy in a small Georgia town, where Jason Bateman\u2019s character, Terry Maitland, is suspected of the crime. He\u2019s being investigated by Ben Mendelsohn\u2019s Ralph Anderson, who has recently lost his own son, and because we\u2019re talking Stephen King, Cynthia Erivo joins the fray as an unorthodox investigator with \u201cuncanny abilities\u201d who is more able to confront inexplicable circumstances around the case. Mystery! The Outsider premieres on January 12.\n\nRelated", "description": "Jason Bateman, Ben Mendelsohn, and Cynthia Erivo star in the trailer for the HBO miniseries \u201cThe Outsider,\u201d based on the book by Stephen King.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-the-outsider.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
