Duff's career as a child star with roles in Casper Meets Wendy and Lizzie McGuire prevented her from attending a brick-and-mortar school when she was around Luca's age.\n\n\"This guy with his spirit and kindness\ud83d\udc94Homework is already no joke in 2nd grade. I stopped going to 'real' school in 3rd grade so I\u2019m actually doomed,\" Duff captioned a photo of herself with her son. \"I am left scratching my head alll the time looking at his homework and I\u2019m terrified for next year! Although Singapore math is the sh*t....also learned a lot about tick birds this week. #rhinosbegrateful.\"\n\nWhile Duff tries to help her son with his homework, he's also learning more and more about his mom's untraditional childhood. The Younger star recently revealed that she screened The Lizzie McGuire Movie for Luca and his little sister, 11-month-old Banks, and during an August interview with ET, she said Luca was a bit of a Lizzie fan.\n\n\"He's seen some clips on YouTube, and I think he's getting into it,\" Duff said at D23, admitting \"he's still a little young\" and very into Marvel these days.\n\n\"I don't think I could even tell him that I'm here, if I took pictures with all of these Marvel stars,\" she added. \"But he thinks I'm pretty cool and I think he likes seeing me at an age closer to him.\"\n\nDuff will be reprising her role as Lizzie McGuire for Disney+.
