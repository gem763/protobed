My Guide to Living Your Best Life.\n\nShe said: \"It's going really really well, he's a good boy.\n\n\"I bumped into him, I'm not going to say too much because I'm bringing out an extra chapter of my book. It was a really weird time and yeah it was just mad, I can't explain it.\"\n\nDani also addressed the numerous engagement rumours that have been floating around ever since she got with her beau.\n\n(Image: GC Images)\n\n(Image: MTV)\n\nShe told us: \"I always say or comment things and have a bit of a laugh if I've had a drink and I'll say like, 'Oh are you gong to marry me?' and everyone's like, 'Dani demands marriage'.\n\n\"I'm not demanding anything, not yet, when it happens, it happens.\"\n\nDani is teaming up with her dad, hardman Danny Dyer for the second series of True Love Or True Lies.\n\nWhile her old man acts as narrator - like he did on the first series - Dani will be hosting the show and heading into the house every single day.\n\nThe show sees a host of couples competing for a cash prize, although some of them aren't actually together.\n\n(Image: MTV)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nContestants live together and take part in a series of challenges in a bid to figure out who's faking love and who's feeling it for real.\n\nDani says she loves being part of the show, even if her dad does make a few cheeky jokes about her.\n\nShe said: \"I watched it [last time], it was weird because I'd just come off Love Island and my dad said he'd done that while I was in there.\n\n\"I loved it, it's so different and so fun, it was wicked. I was terrible at figuring out who was fake. You look at everyone individually and think they're fake, you sort of go off your own experiences, and that's what makes it so good. The fact that liars won last time says it all really.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nEastEnders star Danny left viewers in stitches with his quick-witted take-downs of contestants on series one, and Dani says this time is no different.\n\nShe said: \"I've heard a few things from this series and he's such a wind up, especially now I'm on it.\n\n\"He does a few things and I'm like, 'How dare you?' but it works and he bigs me up as well so it's really cute.\"\n\n* True Love Or True Lies premieres October 21 at 9pm on MTV and continues every night for two weeks\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
