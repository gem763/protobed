That means Nintendo\u2019s hybrid console is dominating its two main competitors, the PS4 and the Xbox One.\n\nAccording to the NPD Group, a market research company, the Switch has been the top-selling video game console in U.S. for 10 months now. The sales figures are probably bolstered by the release of the Switch Lite, a handheld-only version of the game released earlier this year. Mat Piscatella, games industry analyst for NPD Group, said on Twitter \u201cNintendo Switch is the only platform with sales gains both in September as well as year-to-date.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the Switch has eclipsed its fellow consoles might say as much, if not more, about its unique place in the console generation as it does about the Switch itself. While the PS4 and Xbox One are headed for their sunset days \u2014 Sony and Microsoft are revving up the hype cycles for the PS5 and Xbox Scarlett, respectively \u2014 the Nintendo Switch is still young, fresh, and has a steady stream of quality games coming out for it.\n\nBesides the new releases, Nintendo is also on a crusade to have just about every game \u2014 indie, AAA, or retro \u2014 on the Nintendo Switch. This means that, for a console with only two years of life behind it and no physical backwards compatibility, the Switch has a staggeringly large library. While Microsoft and Sony are undoubtedly going to squeeze every last drop of blood they can out of their consoles before the next generation comes out, we already know it\u2019ll be at least a year before one of them (the PS5) will be available to buy \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of space to fill.\n\nNintendo also said that four Switch games have sold more than 6 million units in North America: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. None of those should really come as a surprise to anyone. That\u2019s basically the Nintendo franchise Dream Team. The company also touted its holiday lineup, which will include Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, the Wii Fit successor Ring Fit Adventure, and of course a new Pok\u00e9mon twofer.\n\nThe console isn\u2019t without its issues \u2014 the hardware problems, the fact that you still need your phone close by to play multiplayer \u2014 but right now it\u2019s the most vibrant and promising of the consoles currently on the market. I suspect once we see the PS5 or Project Scarlett properly, people might start saving their money for those.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F07%2FSwitch-Lite.jpg&signature=7f5a3e3f036524bd20c96e4580c32259", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
