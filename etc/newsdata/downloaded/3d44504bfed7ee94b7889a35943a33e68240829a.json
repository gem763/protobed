Announcements ordered shoppers to evacuate the building while an internal app advised store workers to close their shutters and take cover.\n\nWithin five minutes the suspect was detained alongside tram tracks outside the Arndale Centre, with one witness saying his weapon was \u2018about 12 inches long and looked like a machete\u2019.\n\nIt is understood the suspect \u2013 believed to be a British national from Manchester \u2013 was not previously known to MI5 or counter-terrorism police. Tonight he was being detained under the Mental Health Act.\n\nOne of the victims was identified as Chloe McGurk, 19, from Northern Ireland.\n\nA friend, Ellen Da Conceicao, who was with her at the time, wrote on Facebook: \u2018All we wanted to do was come over to Manchester for a girly weekend, but instead the first shopping centre we step into this happens. We\u2019re all so shaken and can\u2019t for the life of us understand how someone could be so low to do this to our Chloe and other victims.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t get that man\u2019s face and knife out of my head and probably won\u2019t for a very long time. Chloe is on the mend and thanks everyone for their support.\u2019\n\nMiss McGurk is thought to have stab and slash injuries to her hand. She was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary.\n\nThree other women, including one in her 40s and two others whose ages are unknown, were injured along with a man in his 50s.

He is now being held under the Mental Health Health\n\nA photo from inside the centre shows police and paramedics outside a Starbucks cafe. A shop worker said the knifeman was 'lunging at people' as he ran past shops\n\nPictures from the scene show an injured man and two women being wheeled away from the scene, sitting up in stretchers\n\nA friend of one of the victims from Northern Ireland wrote on Facebook after the attack that 'all we wanted to do was come over to Manchester for a girly weekend'\n\nOne shopper described the 'nightmare' of seeing the knifeman plunging his blade into the back of one victim as he walked past Starbucks. Photos of the crime scene showed the tables were overturned and some where covered in blood.\n\nA witness said: 'I heard a woman scream. I span around and saw this guy who had a knife in his hand. It looked like he had stabbed her back. There was blood pouring from her and she just fell to the floor.\n\n'As soon as I saw the knife I just ran as fast as I could and was warning others what happened. Everyone was looking down from the first floor and there was real panic, people screaming.\n\n'The police were there in minutes and then we were evacuated. It was like a nightmare. Like something out of a horror film. It was awful. I can't get that image out of my head.'\n\nAssistant chief constable Russ Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'We do not know the motivation for this terrible attack. It appears random, is certainly brutal and of course extremely frightening for anyone who witnessed it.\n\n'At this time we do not believe that there is anyone else involved in this attack but we will be constantly keeping this under review.\n\n'We have specially trained officers supporting those injured from the attack.\n\n'We'll have increased patrols, including armed patrols, in the city centre this weekend.'\n\nPictures from the scene show three conscious victims - two women and a man - being wheeled out of the shopping centre, sitting up on stretchers. The condition of the other two victims is unclear.\n\nA photo from inside the centre shows paramedics and police dealing with a victim at a table outside a Starbucks coffee shop inside the mall.\n\nShopper Freddie Houlder, 22, was in the centre when he heard 'a load of screams just outside' the store he was in. He said a woman then came into the shop and told others 'a guy just ran past the shop and tried to stab me'.\n\nMr Houlder added: 'Luckily she had quite a thick jacket - she thought originally it was a fake knife because of how easily it grazed off but police came in and said it was a real knife and she burst into tears. She was so lucky she was wearing a thick jacket... he was running around going for as many people as possible.'\n\nHe added: 'I definitely don't think it was gang violence because this guy was going around trying to stab random people, I believe,' he added.\n\nAnother store worker caught in the chaos said: 'A man was running around with a knife lunging at multiple people, one of which came into my store visibly shaken with a small graze. Soon after, security staff told all retail staff to close their doors and move the public to the back of the stores.'\n\nShopper Janet Loudon, 21, said: 'I came out of work and saw a black man shouting racial slurs like 'n****r' and being very hostile towards an Arndale worker, who was also black.\n\n'I carried on walking but saw police run inside the Arndale and heard someone shout 'knife' and another shout 'bomb' \u2013 I was frantically looking for my friend.\n\n'That was when I heard that people had been stabbed and everyone was panicking and frantic. We saw a victim slouched between an ATM which was a horrific sight and she was taken away to be helped.'\n\nShe added: 'It wasn't clear what the man was saying but he was swearing and telling the public \"I'm going to f*** you up\" repeatedly and he got more and more agitated. He was pointing at the police and Arndale workers and saying things like \"just because I'm a n****\".'\n\nShopper Rachel Vickers, 37, saw the arrest. She said: 'I saw the man on the ground after he'd been arrested. A female officer was holding what looked like a machete in a plastic tube.'\n\nAnother shop worker added: 'I saw a policewoman with them holding a footlong knife in a tube \u2013 I didn\u2019t see if it had blood on it. It was about 12ins long and looked like a machete.'\n\nA young woman appeared to be among the victims after she was stretched away, conscious, by a team of paramedics\n\nAnother woman was among the victims wheeled away surrounded by armed police at around midday yesterday\n\nPolice said: 'We're working to understand why he committed his awful attack'\n\nPCSOs drew attacker away from victims Police told how the knifeman was confronted by two PCSO drew the man away from victims.

Assistant chief constable Russ Jackson said today: 'We don\u2019t know the motivation for the attack. It was brutal and extremely frightening for everyone who witnessed it.

'We'll have increased patrols and armed patrols in the city centre to reassure people.

We will update as the situation becomes clear.\n\n'A 19-year-old woman\u2013 was taken to hospital with stab wounds. Another woman was also taken to hospital with stab injuries. Both their conditions are described as stable.\n\n'A man in his 50s has also been taken to hospital with stab wounds. A fourth victim \u2013 a woman in her 40s - who was not stabbed \u2013 has been assessed and did not need to go to hospital following assessment by paramedics.\n\n'A man in his 40s \u2013 who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of serious assault \u2013 remains in custody for questioning.'\n\nAnother victim, a woman, presented herself to hospital with non-serious injuries.\n\nOne witness was leaving the nearby Football Museum when people were evacuated.\n\nHe said: 'There were loads of police and ambulance.
