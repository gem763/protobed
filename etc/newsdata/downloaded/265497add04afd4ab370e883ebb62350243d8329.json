AVGO -0.92% to stop requiring contract terms with customers that the bloc alleges are anticompetitive, even as a probe into the practices continues\u2014the first time regulators have used such an injunction in 18 years.\n\nThe announcement of so-called interim measures against Broadcom marks the first time EU regulators have used the power since 2001 and comes amid tightening European scrutiny of U.S. technology giants.\n\nEuropean Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has overseen the EU\u2019s regulatory push against Silicon Valley, said Wednesday that Broadcom\u2019s contract terms with six main customers would \u201ccreate serious and irreversible harm to competition\u201d if no action were taken.\n\nMs. Vestager had said in June she would issue the injunction against Broadcom if merited by investigations into its set-top box or broadband modem businesses. Broadcom said at the time the investigation was without merit.\n\nOn Wednesday, Broadcom said it would appeal the commission\u2019s order, while complying meanwhile.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that these [allegedly exclusivity-inducing] provisions have a meaningful effect on whether the customers choose to purchase Broadcom products,\u201d a company spokesperson said.\n\nCritics have urged the commission to use its interim powers more frequently, because formal competition proceedings can take years. Left unchecked, any anticompetitive behavior could cause permanent damage to a market before authorities pass judgment.\n\nInterim measures, Ms. Vestager said, \u201care one way of enforcing competition rules in a fast and effective manner, especially in fast-moving markets.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nMs. Vestager, who has gained international recognition for imposing record fines on tech companies, recently said that financial penalties fail to change how corporations act and she wants to find new measures. Recourse to interim measures is \u201cnow on the table\u2014it\u2019s a living tool in our toolbox,\u201d she said.\n\nHer use of the power comes as antitrust authorities around the world are \u201cbeating themselves up over their ability to react quickly to markets,\u201d said Alec Burnside, a partner with law firm Dechert in Brussels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s welcome that the commission is reinvestigating this part of its tool kit,\u201d said Mr. Burnside, whose clients have fought cases against tech giants including Google.\n\nThe lawyer noted that while the Broadcom case involves digital technologies, it is still about the sale of physical products such as microchips to a very small number\u2014six\u2014of its customers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still the challenge ahead of using the [legal] tools in a digital environment, rather than the supply of physical goods,\u201d he said.\n\nSome competition lawyers have said interim measure risks delaying cases further, as the commission will need to fight legal challenges to an order in court before being able to complete the underlying case.\n\nMs. Vestager said her team has investigated Broadcom for one year, during which the company and third parties responded to questions, and Broadcom made its case at a hearing. Following that, the number of customer agreements targeted were cut to six from seven.\n\nRelated Video The Department of Justice is investigating the U.S.'s largest tech firms for allegedly monopolistic behavior.
