But the protests have grown, with anger over living costs and inequality simmering amongst demonstrators.\n\nBut speaking to reporters in the country's capital, Santiago, President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era defended the government's response.\n\n\"We are at war against a powerful, implacable enemy, who does not respect anything or anyone and who is willing to use violence and crime without any limits,\" he said.\n\nSantiago was hit particularly hard by looting and arson, with buses set on fire, metro stations smashed and riot police struggling to quell the violence.\n\nChile is one of the region\u2019s wealthiest countries, but the riots have exposed divisions over rising inequality and intensified calls for economic reforms. The sight of soldiers and tanks in the streets hasn\u2019t been seen since 1990, when Chile returned to democracy.", "description": "Its the first time tanks have been sent to the streets since Chile returned to democracy in 1990.", "authors": ["Trent Murray"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/74/44/1000x563_cmsv2_438c9389-be68-5fa8-90b8-8219e7d913b1-4247444.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
