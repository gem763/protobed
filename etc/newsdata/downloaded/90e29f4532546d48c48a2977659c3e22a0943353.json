(AP) - Washington Redskins coach Jay Gruden wanted to make one thing perfectly clear as he began speaking to reporters after a second consecutive poor showing by his team\u2019s defense: \u201cThere are no excuses to be had.\u201d\n\nAnd then, one by one, he began offering up, well, excuses - for why his team is 0-2 after a 31-21 loss to the visiting Dallas Cowboys on Sunday, for why the defense is following good starts with terrible finishes, for why giving up 50-yard TD passes is a regular occurrence.\n\n\u201cWe have a very talented group on defense,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously not reaching them.\u201d\n\nAsked whether any sort of personnel or coaching change might be needed, Gruden quickly replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have to hit the panic button yet.\u201d\n\nWhich leaves open the question of when \u201cyet\u201d might arrive.\n\nGruden noted that defensive lineman Jonathan Allen is out with an injury. He mentioned that he\u2019s \u201cminus a couple of pieces in the secondary.\u201d And he later reiterated those issues.\n\nHe made reference to the Cowboys - who trailed 7-0 at the outset Sunday - and the Philadelphia Eagles - the team Washington led 17-0 and 20-7 before losing to 32-27 in Week 1 - as having \u201ctwo of the best offensive lines in pro football.\u201d\n\nHe made sure everyone realizes there are some rookies and other new additions, so it\u2019s a \u201cvery young defense\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s not like we\u2019re the most experienced group.\u201d\n\nAt least Gruden and defensive coordinator Greg Manusky get an extra day to devise things to stop their next opponent, because the Chicago Bears come to town on a Monday night for Week 3.\n\n\u201cI need some veterans to step up and take this team by the throat,\u201d Gruden said, \u201cand I think it\u2019ll happen.\u201d\n\nThe defense was the side of the ball that, in theory anyway, was going to keep the Redskins in games and, if all worked according to plan, help them win some this season.\n\nThings started off well enough for Washington\u2019s defense on Sunday.\n\nThe Cowboys\u2019 initial possession resulted in a three-and-out and a punt.\n\nTheir next drive concluded with a poor pass by Dak Prescott going off a receiver\u2019s hand and ending up intercepted by safety Montae Nicholson.\n\nAnd Dallas\u2019 third turn on offense led to another three-and-out.\n\nNot too shabby.\n\nAnd then? Well, after that, here is how Dallas\u2019 drives went: TD; TD; TD; field goal after penalties on Dallas negated a TD; then, yes, yet another TD.\n\nWhat at one point was a 7-0 lead for the Redskins was suddenly a 31-14 deficit.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all that different from went transpired in Week 1.\n\nPrescott ended up 26 for 30 for 269 yards and three touchdowns through the air, plus a 42-yard run. Ezekiel Elliott ran for 111 yards on 23 carries and a 1-yard TD, part of a 213-yard day on the ground for Dallas (2-0).\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t give up 200 yards rushing to anybody. Anytime, any place, anywhere,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cSo that\u2019s something we really have to hone in on.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s splashiest veteran addition of the offseason was safety Landon Collins, who arrived as a free agent from the division rival New York Giants. The defensive line seemed set with a young trio of Allen, Daron Payne and Matt Ioannidis. The revamped linebacking corps was designed to be faster and better. First-round draft pick Montez Sweat was a supposed \u201csteal\u201d who would help get to the QB.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nDidn\u2019t help that Allen got hurt in Week 1 and missed Week 2 entirely. Or that starting cornerback Quinton Dunbar was sidelined with an injury against Dallas.\n\nBut it also didn\u2019t help that Prescott was able to complete a 51-yard TD pass to Devin Smith on Sunday, a week after Washington allowed a pair of 50-yard-plus scoring throws from Carson Wentz to DeSean Jackson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit surprised. I\u2019d lie to you if I said I wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s shocking,\u201d Norman said. \u201cWe\u2019re much better than what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington Redskins coach Jay Gruden wanted to make one thing perfectly clear as he began speaking to reporters after a second consecutive poor showing by his team's defense: \"There are no excuses to be had.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/cowboys_redskins_football_36370_c0-331-3084-2129_s1770x1032.jpg?71d71ad89c6d5a8bab712f658cdc2dffe1efb6d9", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
