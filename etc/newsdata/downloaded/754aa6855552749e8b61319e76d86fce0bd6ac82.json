He cited several regions such as Mali and the Levant but gave no dates.\n\nHe called on supporters to free women living in camps in Iraq and Syria following the group's defeat in both countries.\n\nThousands of women including foreigners from Europe and North African countries joined Islamic State, subscribing to its brutal interpretation of Islam and often marrying militants.\n\nSome remain ardent supporters of its ideology and live in camps they fled to in eastern Syria, now under the control of the Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that drove Islamic State from its final piece of territory in March.\n\n\"As for the worst and most important matter, the prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate. Your brothers and sisters; do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them,\" Baghdadi said.\n\n\"Do not hesitate to pay ransom if you cannot free them by force, and attack their butchers like investigators and judges and any... aggressors,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nRULED OVER MILLIONS\n\nHe also said the United States and its proxies had been defeated in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the U.S. had been \"dragged\" into Mali and Niger.\n\nMilitants loyal to Adnan Abu Waleed al-Sahrawi, the leader of Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, operate along Mali's border with Burkina Faso and Niger. In 2017, they killed four members of U.S. special forces and four Nigerien soldiers in an ambush near the village of Tongo Tongo.\n\nAt the height of its power IS ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to the outskirts of Baghdad.\n\nBut the fall in 2017 of Mosul and Raqqa, its strongholds in Iraq and Syria respectively, stripped Baghdadi of the trappings of a caliph and turned him into a fugitive thought to be moving along the desert border between Iraq and Syria.\n\nBefore Islamic State published a video message of Baghdadi, an Iraqi, in April, there had been conflicting reports over whether he was alive.\n\nU.S. air strikes killed most of Baghdadi\u2019s top lieutenants, including \"war minister\u201d Abu Omar al-Shishani, \"governor of the Iraqi region\" Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, group spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani and \"governor for Syria\" Abu Ali al-Anbari.\n\nDespite losing its last significant territory, Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria's desert and Iraq's cities.\n\nIn West Africa\u2019s troubled Sahel region, Islamist extremists have been exploiting local conflicts to extend their reach, with most attacks blamed on groups loosely affiliated with Al Qaeda. In Nigeria, a breakaway faction of the extremist group Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
