Leo Woodberry, executive director of the New Alpha Community Development Corporation in Florence, S.C. In coastal South Carolina, for example, residents in largely black towns have been told they won\u2019t be eligible for flood insurance if they don\u2019t elevate their homes; but a survey of local engineering groups showed the cost starts at $20,000 for a 900-square-foot house, Woodberry said. In New York City, many residents who die from heat stroke are African American, Peggy Shepard, executive director of West Harlem Environmental Action Inc., also known as WE ACT for Environmental Justice, said at a Sept. 12 roundtable hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, where Beverly and Woodberry also spoke.\n\n\u201cThis is about social disruption,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cExtreme heat is killing thousands every year.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Environment cited a University of California at Berkeley study that said blacks are 52 percent more likely than whites to live in so-called \u201curban heat islands,\u201d where the sun beams down on brick, concrete and asphalt.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that this is a topic area that black politicians, including the CBC [Congressional Black Caucus], have not focused on as much,\u201d Thomas A. LaVeist, dean of Tulane University\u2019s School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s because the stereotype is that the environment is about tree hugging or saving exotic birds.\u201d\n\n\u201cMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus say they\u2019ve heard the call and are working on solutions,\u201d Bloomberg Environment reported. \u201cThe caucus is made up of 55 African American members of the House and Senate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be energetic in supporting any legislation that is aimed at improving the environment, but I also have to tell you how congested the major issues have become,\u201d Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) said in the Bloomberg Environment article.\n\nCleaver said lawmakers could add language to the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) budget to put resources in poor black communities, and the National Flood Insurance Program could add more protections for black communities.\n\nBloomberg Environment reported that some are already putting out legislation with this goal in mind, including Reps. Maxine Waters (D-CA), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) and A. Donald McEachin (D-VA).\n\n\u201cFor African Americans and people living in urban poor communities, it provides them with an empowerment tool to enforce the law, to demand action, and to try to get remediation done,\u201d Grijalva told Bloomberg Environment.\n\n\u201cSeparately, Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), chairwoman of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, is working on a climate bill to be rolled out in March that, among other things, will aim to help communities of color living near pollution sources,\u201d Bloomberg Environment reported. \u201cMany House Democrats think there\u2019s value in putting these measures up for a vote, even if they have little chance in the Senate now, to send a message.\u201d\n\nThe article also quoted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) about her Green New Deal resolution that puts social justice even above climate change.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s backwards and shortsighted to say, \u2018Well, let\u2019s just throw a bunch of solar panels on everyone\u2019s roof and call it a day,\u2019\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cBecause you cannot build a winning political coalition to fight climate change on just technocratic solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy fighting for the actual justice and livelihood of working people, you are going to create the political energy to actually address climate change,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Believers say man-made climate change causes strong storms, rising tides, and hot temperatures that allegedly hurts black communities.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177053353-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
