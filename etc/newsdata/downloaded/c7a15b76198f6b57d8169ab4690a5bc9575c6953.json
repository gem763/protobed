It is now a foregone conclusion that we will see a level of displacement in future. Robots, to give one example, will replace humans in the factory shop floor and elsewhere. This leads to the question, are there policies to mitigate the human impact of an inevitable change?\n\nThere is one policy India should consider. It\u2019s one which doesn\u2019t provide fiscal concessions which lower the price of machines in relation to labour.\n\nIn India, companies get a significant tax benefit (Section 32 of the Income Tax Act) if they invest in capital assets.\n\nThe budget documents showed that finance ministry projected that for 2018-19, of the revenue foregone of Rs 1,08,785 crore, tax benefits on account of depreciation came to Rs 67,758 crore.\n\nThe government is encouraging companies to transition to a tax regime where they have to pay a lower tax on the condition they forego benefits such as depreciation. This is a sensible step on the part of government.\n\nOf the handful of reasons why it is a sensible step, one is that it provides a level playing field between labour and capital assets. At the moment, tax benefits on depreciation is tantamount to a subsidy for investing in machines. This is odd for a country where capital is scarce but labour is plentiful. Any policy move to provide a level playing field is one which is fair to labour.\n\nIn the international context, South Korea initiated steps to do something similar. A couple of years ago, the South Korean government reduced the tax deduction on business investment in automation. This is tantamount to lowering the depreciation-related tax benefits in India.\n\nOne entrepreneur who would agree with this trend is Bill Gates. He favoured a tax system popularly known as \u201crobot tax\u201d. Gates is not in favour of subsidizing automation.\n\nIncreasing automation is inevitable. It doesn\u2019t need to be pushed along with a tax subsidy.", "description": "A conversation which comes up often when automation is discussed is the impact it will have on jobs in future.
