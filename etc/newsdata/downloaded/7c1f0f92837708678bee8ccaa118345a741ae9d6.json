Take a look inside the futuristic opera", "language": "en", "text": "What's the deal with airplane food?\n\nIf Singapore Airlines has anything to say about it, that classic stand-up joke will soon be a thing of the past.\n\nThe airline made headlines in 2017 when it announced a new \"farm-to-plane\" dining service coming to its long-haul flights, and again this spring when it announced its first sourcing partner.\n\nNow, the locally-sourced, fine-dining initiative is about to launch on the world's longest flight.\n\nAfter months of planning and preparation, the farm-to-plane service is kicking off next month on the airline's flight between the New York City-area Newark airport and Singapore.\n\nThe airline will work with AeroFarms, a unique indoor vertical farming company based in Newark, New Jersey, to source leafy greens and vegetables for several of the appetizers in its business class cabin starting in October. Meals made with the local greens will eventually be expanded to other courses and other cabins \u2014 the plane operating the flight is entirely business class and premium economy.\n\nWhile the novelty of the \"farm-to-table\" concept in the sky, coupled with the fresh taste of the meals has an obvious appeal, the airline also touts the sustainability of both sourcing ingredients locally, and supporting eco-efficient businesses like AeroFarms with its business. It could be easy to dismiss that \u2014 the airline, after all, is an airline, and relies on fossil fuels to fly emission-generating planes around the world \u2014 but there's a twofold benefit that sourcing crops from a company like AeroFarms can provide.\n\nNormally, while catering in the winter, \"the greens for our flights from Newark had to be flown in from 3,000 miles away, from California, Mexico, or Florida,\" said James Boyd, Singapore's head of US communications. \"This allows us to instead source our greens from less than five miles away, cutting down on shipping waste.\"\n\nAdditionally, Singapore is looking to expand the farm-to-plane initiative with similar sustainable urban farms around the world, giving a boost to growing eco-friendly businesses \u2014 for instance, AeroFarms, which said it plans to add more facilities, is a certified B-Corp, a designation given to businesses that meet certain environmental and ethical standards.\n\nBusiness Insider recently toured the AeroFarms facility at Newark to see how everything works. Take a look below for our walkthrough of the facility, and the process of getting the greens from the farm to the skies.", "description": "Singapore Airlines partnered with AeroFarms, an urban farm in Newark that uses \"aeroponic\" farming to grow crops for farm-to-plane dining.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d814c422e22af5e200ccab7-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
