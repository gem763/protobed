REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido/Illustration\n\nThe deal for an undisclosed sum, which follows Uber\u2019s disappointing IPO in May, would see it expand Santiago-based Cornershop, which now operates in Mexico, Chile, Canada and Peru into \u201cmany more countries around the world,\u201d Cornershop Chief Executive Oskar Hjertonsson said.\n\nThe app provides delivery of \u201cgroceries to your front door in one hour\u201d from retailers including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Mexico\u2019s Chedraui (CHDRAUIB.MX).\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s getting a ride, ordering food from your favorite restaurant, or soon, getting groceries delivered, we want Uber to be the operating system for your everyday life,\u201d Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement.\n\nHe tweeted an image suggesting Uber would launch a rebranded app using its existing format, potentially encompassing all its services including taxis, bicycles, groceries and restaurant deliveries.\n\nUber said it expected to close on its Cornershop purchase in early 2020, \u201csubject to regulatory approval.\u201d\n\nAn Uber spokesman said the company expected regulatory checks in both Mexico and Chile. He said Uber viewed Cornershop as \u201ca concrete example\u201d of Khosrowshahi\u2019s new strategy to \u201cprovide solutions to solve problems in people\u2019s daily lives.\u201d\n\nBoth Uber and Cornershop declined to comment further.\n\nNathan Lustig, a managing partner of Magma Partners, a seed stage venture capital fund for tech firms in Latin America, said Uber seemed to be gearing toward \u201csuper-app\u201d status similar to Tencent Holdings\u2019 (0700.HK) WeChat and Rappi, backed by SoftBank (9984.T).\n\nRappi has expanded at a breakneck pace in Latin America, with its restaurant delivery service emerging as a key competitor for Uber Eats.\n\nMexican antitrust officials earlier this year blocked a $225 million bid by Walmart to buy Cornershop, citing concerns the retail giant could not guarantee a level playing field for rival retailers.\n\nLustig said Cornershop had expanded rapidly since the Walmart deal fell through, resulting in a likely higher price tag for the Uber deal.\n\n\u201cI believe they grew the business multiple times since Walmart\u2019s deal was first announced,\u201d he said. \u201cCornershop\u2019s tech and ideas work globally, so it\u2019s not just a Latin American bet.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Uber said Cornershop would continue to operate under its current leadership, reporting to a board with majority Uber representation.\n\nCornershop has rapidly gained popularity in local markets, including Chile, where its uniformed staff are a common sight in the aisles of grocery stores hunting down orders for customers, before delivering them in branded, recyclable bags.\n\nNews of the deal comes amid a flurry of similar announcements from Uber, as it seeks to expand beyond its core taxi app.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nUber shares rose 4.8% in New York trading, although it was unclear whether the gains were related to the Cornershop move.\n\nThis week Uber launched a boat service in Nigeria\u2019s populous Lagos, expanded a helicopter taxi service in New York\u2019s JFK airport and began an app in Chicago to connect workers with businesses needing to fill available shifts.\n\nIncreased diversification comes as Uber\u2019s main ride hailing operations face mounting competition in Asia, and heightened U.S. regulatory scrutiny over the classification of its drivers as independent contractors.", "description": "Uber Technologies Inc said on Friday it would buy a majority stake in Chilean online grocery provider Cornershop as the ride hailing company seeks to widen its fast-growing food delivery app to include groceries and other goods.", "authors": ["Aislinn Laing", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439739049&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1JW", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
