That led a frustrated Saban to proclaim, \u201cwe\u2019re playing the best teams that we can get to play us.\u201d He even challenged a reporter to \u201ccall around\u201d and try to find a team that will travel to Tuscaloosa to play the Tide.\n\nIt seems like an in-state program, Troy, is up for the challenge. The school\u2019s football account hilariously tweeted out part of Saban\u2019s rant with the waving emoji.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nTroy is routinely one of the best teams in the Sun Belt, but has never played Alabama in its history. Instead, the Tide have gone against Duke and New Mexico State and still have Southern Miss and Western Carolina left on the non-conference slate this season.\n\nAlabama paid New Mexico State $1.7 million to travel across the country to get demolished in Bryant-Denny Stadium. Troy would probably make the cross-state trip for a cheaper amount.\n\nAlabama head coach Nick Saban chats with New Mexico State head coach Doug Martin. (AP Photo/Vasha Hunt)\n\nSaban has been on the record for years with his desire to adjust college football scheduling to only play Power Five vs. Power Five matchups. But in the current setup, that doesn\u2019t seem realistic any time soon. An adjustment that Alabama has made, however, is scheduling more home-and-home series with Power Five opponents, pushing aside neutral site games like the one the Tide played against Duke to open the current season.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlabama will face SEC foe South Carolina on Saturday in Columbia, so that\u2019ll be more challenging for Saban\u2019s group. And if you\u2019re interested, Saban\u2019s full rant from last Saturday is below. It\u2019s a good one.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "After his team\u2019s blowout victory over New Mexico State, Nick Saban went on a bit of a rant on the caliber of non-conference opponents Alabama can attract.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YkWS0q1_joRaj0gZ7X3vKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PmWX4MVkImkBEPsm4fF8Gw--~B/aD0yNDI3O3c9MzY0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7b24a600-d4d6-11e9-b675-fc9a384deef9", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
