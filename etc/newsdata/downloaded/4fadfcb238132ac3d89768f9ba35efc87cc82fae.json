The series, which is based on Sakyo Komatsu\u2019s 1973 science fiction novel Japan Sinks, follows a series of natural disasters that hit Japan, as a team of scientists desperately try to convince the disbelieving government of the imminent threat. Sounds not at all familiar! Yuasa, who is the mind behind the psychosexual nightmare series Devilman Crybaby, is attached to direct. Yuasa is known for his distinctive, idiosyncratic animation style, and will produce the show at his studio, Science SARU. The show is set to premiere in (surprise!) 2020.", "description": "Director Masaaki Yuasa is set to direct Japan Sinks 2020 for Netflix.
