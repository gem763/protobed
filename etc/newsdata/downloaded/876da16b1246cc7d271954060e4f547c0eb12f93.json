It earned the name in part because, as far as many men on the receiving end are concerned, it\u2019s porny. Many men are eager to gawk at a naked young woman, which helps these images go viral: Vox points out that ordinary Internet users weren\u2019t Googling to learn what Hill did or didn\u2019t do. They were Googling to sneak a glimpse of her with another woman. Top search terms, after \u201cthrouple,\u201d included \u201cphotos\u201d and \u201cuncensored.\u201d\n\nJust as crucially, many of these same men are eager to smear a woman as a slut even as they\u2019re gawking, which also makes the images potent tools of retribution. Maybe compromising photos of a male legislator in his more vigorous years would rocket across the web, too, and were employees involved, he could surely meet his political demise as well. But he\u2019d probably earn accolades for his virility instead of attacks for his wantonness along the way.", "description": "", "authors": ["Molly Roberts", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Why-Katie-Hill-Was-Right-Resign-We-Shouldnt-Feel-Good-About-It"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
