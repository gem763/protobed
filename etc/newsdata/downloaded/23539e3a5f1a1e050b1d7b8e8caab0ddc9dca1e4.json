The crazy fandom was seen across the globe recently when Avengers: Endgame, one of the highest grossing films of all times, was released. But are Marvel films considered cinema?\n\nOf course, they are. The most basic explanation that one can give is that they are movies which released in theatres, after all. But the iconic Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese doesn\u2019t think like that.\n\nHis controversial critique of Marvel movies where in he said that Marvel films are not cinema and that the closest he can think of them is as \u201cactors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.\u201d\n\nThis drew a lot of criticism with many big names from the industry expressing their disagreement, including the MCU fans who lashed out at him on social media.\n\nAfter all this, the Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr, who fans think deserves an Oscar for his performance in Avengers: Endgame, has responded.\n\nDon't Miss 124 SHARES 4.6 K SHARES 155 SHARES 704 SHARES\n\nMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way. https://t.co/hzHp8x4Aj8 \u2014 James Gunn (@JamesGunn) October 4, 2019\n\nAccepting the Marvel insult even when it \u201cmakes no sense\u201d, he quipped, \u201cit plays in theatres.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll tell you the truth, I didn't expect (MCU) to become what it became and it is this very large, multi-headed Hydra at this point. I've always had other interests, and according to Scorsese, it's not cinema so I have to take a look at that, you know?,\u201d the 54-year-old actor said.\n\nTwitter\n\nWith that, Robert Downey Jr. added that Marvel movies play in theatres and also do well at the box office. \u201cI mean it plays in theatres. I appreciate his opinion because I think it's like anything, we need all of the different perspectives so we can come to centre and move on.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he felt insulted, he said, \u201cI mean look, it'd be like saying Howard Stern isn't radio. It makes no sense to say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's a lot to be said for how these genre movies -- and I was happy to be part of the 'problem' if there is one -- denigrated the era, the art form, of cinema. And, by the way, when you come in like a stomping beast and you eliminate the competition in such a demonstrative way, it's phenomenal,\u201d he added.\n\nWith inputs from PTI", "description": "After all this, the Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr, who fans think deserves an Oscar for his performance in Avengers: Endgame, has responded to Martin Scorsese's Marvel insult.
