You need psychological stamina. You need to be able to put the hard yards in over a consistent period and accept the setbacks that come your way.\n\n\u201cLike most things in life, that creates a resilience that will help you in the future.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"I\u2019m sure the time Mo Salah spent at Chelsea gave him a layer of that resilience. When you develop that skill of finding a way in life then you take it with you and it\u2019s very useful.\n\n\u201cThere are 11 shining examples of that playing at Anfield every week. They all at some point had a period in their career where they had to overcome a problem or prove doubters wrong.\n\n\"They worked hard, they didn\u2019t quit.\u201d", "description": "The forward left the Reds for the Serie A side in the summer having never played a competitive senior game for the club", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Acffiorentina Twitter", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19771594.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bobby-Duncan-in-action-for-Fiorentina.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
