Andrew Harnik/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2019\u2019s Rucho v. Common Cause was a painful setback for voting rights advocates. By a 5\u20134 vote, SCOTUS slammed the federal courthouse door on partisan gerrymandering claims, ruling that they cannot be brought under the U.S. Constitution. But Rucho had a silver lining in Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s powerful dissent, which showed state judges how to kill off the practice under their own constitutions. Her dissent served as a blueprint for the North Carolina court that invalidated the state\u2019s legislative gerrymander on Tuesday. That decision charts a path forward for opponents of political redistricting. Every state constitution protects the right to vote or participate equally in elections, and state courts can take up Kagan\u2019s call to arms to enforce those protections under state law.\n\nThe brilliance of Kagan\u2019s dissent lay in its clarity: She laid out the precise harms inflicted by partisan gerrymandering and explained how they can be measured and remedied. Kagan identified two distinct but intertwined constitutional violations: Warped maps \u201creduce the weight of certain citizens\u2019 votes,\u201d depriving them of the ability to participate equally in elections; they also punish voters for their political expression and association. These dual injuries, Kagan concluded, implicate fundamental principles of both equal protection and freedom of speech.\n\nAfter castigating her conservative colleagues for minimizing these harms, Kagan illustrated the ease with which courts can address them. In his Rucho opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts insisted that federal courts were unable to determine when a partisan gerrymander goes \u201ctoo far.\u201d Kagan pointed out that, in fact, plenty of lower courts have already done exactly that. These courts deployed a three-part test. First, they ask whether mapmakers intended to entrench their party\u2019s power by diluting votes for their opponents. Second, they ask whether the scheme succeeded. Third, they ask if mapmakers have any legitimate, nonpartisan explanation for their machinations. If they do not, the gerrymander must be tossed out.\n\n\u201cIf you are a lawyer,\u201d Kagan wrote, \u201cyou know that this test looks utterly ordinary. It is the sort of thing courts work with every day.\u201d In practice, the most important part of the test\u2014its evaluation of a gerrymander\u2019s severity\u2014often boils down to a cold, hard look at the data. Take, for instance, North Carolina\u2019s congressional map, which contained 10 Republican seats and 3 Democratic ones. Experts ran 24,518 simulations of the map that used traditional, nonpartisan redistricting criteria. More than 99 percent of them produced at least one more Democratic seat. The exercise verified that North Carolina\u2019s map isn\u2019t just an outlier but \u201can out-out-out-outlier.\u201d\n\nRoberts rejected Kagan\u2019s reasoning, asserting that her test was \u201cindeterminate and arbitrary.\u201d But on Tuesday, the Wake County Superior Court rested its decision on precisely the three-part test that Kagan proposed. And the court deployed Kagan\u2019s methods to demonstrate that North Carolina\u2019s legislative gerrymander is, indeed, an \u201cout-out-out-outlier.\u201d Experts ran thousands of simulations to gauge the severity of the map\u2019s partisanship and found that the current gerrymander is more favorable to Republicans than about 99.99 percent of maps drawn using nonpartisan redistricting factors.\n\nThis fact wouldn\u2019t matter if North Carolina courts were powerless to stop partisan gerrymandering. But state courts are free to interpret their constitutions differently from SCOTUS and are not bound by Rucho. The Wake County Superior Court therefore refused to adopt Roberts\u2019 blas\u00e9 skepticism toward the judiciary\u2019s competence to defend voting rights.\n\nInstead, the court embraced Kagan\u2019s view of gerrymandering as an assault on equal protection and free speech. The North Carolina constitution safeguards \u201cthe fundamental right of each North Carolinian to substantially equal voting power,\u201d the court wrote. It also protects citizens\u2019 ability to engage in \u201ccore means of political expression,\u201d including \u201cvoting for the candidate of one\u2019s choice and associating with the political party\u201d without retaliation. Partisan gerrymandering infringes upon these freedoms, diluting citizens\u2019 vote on the basis of their political expression. In short, the court imbued the North Carolina constitution with the same protections that Kagan sought under the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe court even took a step further than Kagan, because unlike the U.S. Constitution, the North Carolina constitution declares that \u201call elections shall be free.\u201d This clause, the court held, means \u201cthat elections must be conducted freely and honestly to ascertain, fairly and truthfully, the will of the people.\u201d Partisan gerrymandering violates that guarantee by \u201cspecifically and systematically designing the contours of the election districts for partisan purposes and a desire to preserve power.\u201d\n\nExplicit protections against partisan gerrymandering are extremely common in state constitutions.\n\nThis interpretation of \u201cfree elections\u201d closely mirrors a 2018 decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. In that ruling, the court ruled that partisan gerrymandering violates a provision of the Pennsylvania constitution which declares that all elections \u201cshall be free and equal.\u201d An election is not \u201cfree and equal,\u201d the court held, unless every voter has \u201can equal opportunity to translate their votes into representation.\u201d It thus invalidated the gerrymander. (In her Rucho dissent, Kagan cited the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s decision as an example of courts doing exactly what Roberts claimed they could not.)\n\nExplicit protections against partisan gerrymandering are extremely common in state constitutions. Thirteen state constitutions, including Pennsylvania\u2019s, require elections to be \u201cfree and equal,\u201d while an additional 13 demand that elections be \u201cfree and open.\u201d Moreover, 49 state constitutions expressly safeguard the right to vote, which can be interpreted as the right to cast an equal vote undiluted by gerrymandering. Finally, most state constitutions guarantee freedom of speech and equal protection in some capacity. As Kagan noted, any basic conception of free expression and equality should limit politicians\u2019 ability to punish voters on the basis of their political association. And none of these courts is bound by SCOTUS\u2019 cramped view of constitutional liberties; they are free to interpret their state constitutions much more broadly.\n\nNot every state judiciary is as progressive as Pennsylvania\u2019s or North Carolina\u2019s. (Republicans declined to appeal Tuesday\u2019s decision, probably because the North Carolina Supreme Court has a 6\u20131 Democratic majority.) Other states with terrible gerrymanders\u2014like Alabama, Arkansas, Ohio, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin\u2014have much more conservative judiciaries. But in each of those states, supreme court justices are either chosen by the governor or elected by the people. In other words, they are selected through a process that cannot be gerrymandered.\n\nVoting rights advocates are already focused on state supreme courts as the next battleground in the war on gerrymandering, and rightly so. Rucho was a brutal blow, no doubt, but Kagan\u2019s dissent gave state courts a step-by-step guide for tackling the problem of political redistricting. Mapmakers cannot prevent citizens in many gerrymandered states from flipping their supreme courts. As the Wake County Superior Court just proved, state judges are perfectly capable of grabbing the baton from Kagan and running with it.", "description": "North Carolina paid attention.", "authors": ["Mark Joseph Stern"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/4452f7b6-83ef-4e2b-908e-dc3317775407.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
