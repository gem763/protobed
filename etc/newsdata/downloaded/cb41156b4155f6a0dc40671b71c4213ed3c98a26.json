''It's really the Republican Party that has changed more than I have,'' the Senator said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nMr. Weicker was attending the Republican Party's national convention in New Orleans today and could not be reached for comment. An aide, however, did manage to inform the Senator that Mr. Buckley had accused him of ''tergiversations'' - repeated changes of opinion - to which Mr. Weicker's only reply was ''What did he say?''\n\nBut in a heated exchange Sunday with Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, a conservative Republican from New Hampshire, on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Weicker was clearly not in the mood to put on a show of unity. He said he would not run on this year's Republican platform and advised George Bush to act similarly. He then charged that conservatives and evangelicals were ''turning us into a one-note party,'' adding that if those groups should ''want to take a hike, that's their privilege because, believe me, I think we'd do better without them.''
