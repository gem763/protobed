Fink mostly looked sharp as the third quarterback to play important snaps in four games for the Trojans, who lost starter J.T. Daniels to a season-ending knee injury in their opener.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this moment was too big for me,\u201d Fink said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the era of Sam Darnold, and I\u2019ve seen things that are much crazier. Getting in today and showing what I can do is what I really wanted to do by staying here.\u201d\n\nAfter barely playing the past two seasons, Fink nearly went to Illinois as a graduate transfer last spring. The Los Angeles-area native instead decided to stay home and wait for a chance, however remote.\n\n\u201cIn a world where everybody goes different places, this one stayed for his family, waiting for his moment, waiting for his memory,\u201d USC coach Clay Helton said. \u201cAnd what a memory it was tonight. When his number was called, he made the most of it tonight.\u201d\n\nTyler Vaughns, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Pittman all caught TD passes from Fink, while Pittman had the fifth-biggest receiving yardage game in USC history. His remarkable 42-yard catch in the fourth quarter eventually led to a 4-yard TD run by Markese Stepp , who celebrated by handing the ball to Bush, the Trojans great attending the game as a broadcaster despite his NCAA-mandated disassociation from his school.\n\nDevontae Henry-Cole rushed for an early touchdown and Cole Fotheringham caught a TD pass for the Utes (3-1, 0-1), who struggled after star running back Zack Moss left in the first half with an apparent shoulder injury. Utah still has never won at the 96-year-old Coliseum.\n\nTyler Huntley passed for 210 yards and ran for 60 more, but the Utes committed 16 penalties for 120 yards and struggled to get key defensive stops against a green Trojans quarterback and his stellar receivers.\n\n\u201cMostly we had no answer for their receiving corps,\u201d Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. \u201cMichael Pittman did a number on us. We just didn\u2019t do a good enough job on him. We\u2019ve got to rethink some things coaching-wise.\u201d\n\nWith Bush and Urban Meyer watching at the Coliseum as part of Fox Sports\u2019 broadcast crew, USC\u2019s roller coaster season went on the upswing again after last week\u2019s embarrassing overtime loss at BYU.\n\nSlovis had played two encouraging games as the starter after replacing Daniels, but he couldn\u2019t continue after 335-pound Utah defensive tackle Leki Fotu landed on him. Helton said Slovis \u201cgot dinged,\u201d and the USC medical staff held him out.\n\nFink jumped into USC\u2019s Air Raid offense and completed eight of his first nine throws during two game-opening touchdown drives in which he relied heavily on his receivers\u2019 playmaking abilities.\n\nPittman then scored on a brilliant 77-yard catch early in the third quarter, snatching a long pass away from defenders and fending them off on his run.\n\nUTES UPSET\n\nUtah\u2019s mistakes weren\u2019t limited to penalties. USC blocked a field goal attempt, and the Utes also fumbled near the USC goal line 16 seconds before halftime, when they trailed 14-10 despite racking up 284 yards and controlling the ball for more than 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe were supposed to take advantage of our chances in the red zone,\u201d said Huntley, who took his first two sacks of the season. \u201cWe all know the plays were there. We just had to make them.\u201d\n\nBIG D\n\nUSC\u2019s defense came up big in the second half. Isaiah Pola-Mao\u2019s third-down sack from the USC 1 forced Utah to kick a field goal, and Trojans freshman sensation Drake Jackson then got hold of Huntley in the end zone and forced intentional grounding for a safety with 8:51 to play.\n\nREGGIE RETURNS\n\nFans around the Fox Sports broadcast stage let loose several chants of \u201cReggie! Reggie!\u201d for Bush. The retired tailback is still formally disassociated from USC under terms of the NCAA ruling against the school in 2010, but he remains wildly popular among USC fans and current players whose first Trojans memories include Bush\u2019s feats. Meyer is on top of many USC fans\u2019 lists of coaches to replace Helton, but the embattled incumbent is off to a fairly strong start.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUtah: Losing Moss is an enormous blow to any offense, and his long-term health could determine the Utes\u2019 chances for a run at a second straight Pac-12 title. Utah\u2019s inability to finish drives only gets worse with Moss sidelined, and while Huntley\u2019s valiant effort might win future games, it wasn\u2019t enough against the Trojans.\n\nUSC: Another quarterback injury wasn\u2019t enough to slow down the Trojans, even against a solid Utah defense that essentially wiped out their running game. Fink did enough to win, and USC\u2019s defense made several big plays. USC is somehow 3-1 after four games of an extremely difficult six-game start to the season, with Helton finding yet another way to fend off the doubters for another week.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUtah: A late-night visit from Washington State and its Air Raid offense next Saturday, Sept. 28.\n\nUSC: The brutal early schedule continues at defending Pac-12 champion Washington next Saturday, Sept. 28.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Matt Fink decided to stay at Southern California even after finishing third in the Trojans' four-man quarterback competition in training camp last month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/utah_usc_football_33461_c0-165-4235-2634_s1770x1032.jpg?74f84861b69270c2988e3412803e8f1ae1413ce8", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
