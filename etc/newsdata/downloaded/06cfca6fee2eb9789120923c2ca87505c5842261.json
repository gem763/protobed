On Oct. 25, a federal judge ruled that the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is legitimate and that the Administration\u2019s strategy of stonewalling the Congressional investigation doesn\u2019t hold water legally. Meanwhile, both the Administration and its congressional allies are grappling with how best to defend against an increasingly robust set of allegations involving the President, and have yet to develop a coherent, national response.\n\nWhile Congressional Republicans have for the most part remained steadfast in their defense of the White House, public opinion polls in swing states are trending against President Trump, and a handful of high profile defections have rattled party leaders. How this two-pronged battle unfolds will affect not only the impeachment inquiry and Trump\u2019s own political prospects, but also the balance of power between the White House and Congress for decades to come.\n\nThe battle between the two branches of government began on maximalist footing. On Sept. 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi broke with tradition when she announced a formal impeachment inquiry without authorization by a full House vote. Two weeks later, the White House responded with a formal letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone and what one senior White House official described as a \u201ctotal halt\u201d of cooperation with the probe. Since then, a handful of crucial decisions have have shifted the balance of power in favor of Congress.\n\nOn Oct. 25, Judge Beryl Howell, the chief judge in the federal D.C. District Court, issued a decision that included three crucial findings. The first was to order secret grand jury materials from Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to be handed over to the House, giving them a trove of new information to work with.\n\nSecond, Howell ruled that the White House\u2019s sweeping decision to broadly block nearly all Congressional subpoenas was not only legally unsound, but also triggered a need for even broader transparency. Citing the Oct. 8 letter from Cipollone, in which he referred to the impeachment processes as \u201cbaseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process,\u201d Howell called for court-ordered disclosures. \u201cThe White House\u2019s stated policy of non-cooperation with the impeachment inquiry weighs heavily in favor of disclosure,\u201d she wrote. \u201cCongress\u2019s need to access grand jury material relevant to potential impeachable conduct by a President is heightened when the Executive Branch willfully obstructs channels for accessing other relevant evidence.\u201d\n\nThird, Howell explicitly linked her ruling to the current impeachment inquiry, thereby undermining Congressional Republicans\u2019 central complaint that the process has been illegitimate because the House never held an authorizing floor vote. \u201cWe think there\u2019s serious constitutional flaws the way the process is going on,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Jay Sekulow told TIME on Oct. 22. Three days later, Howell called that argument \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d\n\nElliot Mincberg, former chief counsel for oversight and investigations of the House Judiciary Committee, said Howell\u2019s decision amounted to a direct challenge to the Trump Administration\u2019s claim of extreme executive power. \u201cIt\u2019s another step that shows the judiciary isn\u2019t willing to accept these very broad assertions of virtually absolute executive authority,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Justice Department announced on Oct. 28 that it is appealing Howell\u2019s decision, and has asked for a stay on the order to hand over secret grand jury materials. The appeal is based in part on the premise that Pelosi is keeping the impeachment inquiry focused tightly on Ukraine-related conduct, so House investigators don\u2019t need access to grand jury material from the Mueller investigation. But it\u2019s not necessarily true that no secret information in the Mueller report could be relevant to the investigation, and Howell herself seemed to indicate that there could be impeachable conduct buried within the redacted material in 448-page report. \u201cTipping the scale even further toward disclosure is the public\u2019s interest in a diligent and thorough investigation into, and in a final determination about, potentially impeachable conduct by the President described in the Mueller Report,\u201d she wrote.", "description": "A legal and political battle over impeachment will determine the balance of power between the White House and Congress for decades to come.", "authors": ["Alana Abramson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s_FG7GqcvECvIe9ojsazOQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/672acdc3e70b9014735e065fd255969f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
