Taking this into account, you could make the argument that the process of liquefication is actually cheaper than a pipeline,\u201d Mr Boey said.\n\nMr Boey disagreed Australia was short of gas because it\u2019s obvious there is a lot of gas on the east coast.\n\n\u201cThere is gas in place but it\u2019s the policy and commercial framework that sits on top of the gas reserves that presents them from being commercialised at scale which causes the supply crunches.\n\n\u201cWe need a way to liberate supply from the ground because at the moment there\u2019s an artificial constraint at the front end which causes some of the effects we\u2019re now seeing,\u201d he said.\n\nA case in point is at Narrabri in western NSW, which is still to be developed despite growing support from the local community and government.\n\nSantos head of gas commercialisation Jane Norman was confident the project will get through the approval process and once in production, it will only supply the domestic market.\n\n\u201cIt has the potential to supply up to half of the state\u2019s gas needs, so it\u2019s a very important development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the east coast market struggles with supply issues and high prices, Western Australia\u2019s Energy Transition Strategy is designed to ensure reliable and affordable energy into the future is built on abundant natural gas supplies.\n\nEnergy WA\u2019s assistant executive director, Kate Ryan, said the state\u2019s consumers use more natural gas than any other state, despite making up only 10 per cent of the nation\u2019s population.\n\nShe said gas is designed to be more flexible in WA and this is ensured through the state\u2019s reservation policy where the experience on the ground has been very positive.\n\nMs Ryan said with a lot of new LNG having been developed over the last decade in WA, there has been a tightening in the market but nothing like what the eastern states have experienced.\n\n\u201cHow much of this can be attributed to the state\u2019s domestic gas reservation policy is unknown,\u201d Ms Ryan said.", "description": "The tyranny of distance melded with policy inertia on production driving many of the problems in eastern Australia's gas market set it apart from the rest of the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3487%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_96%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2be5bde9a591b50c2cda5979e2aa778238114d5a", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
