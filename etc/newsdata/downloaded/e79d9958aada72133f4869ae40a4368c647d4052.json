Much below average temperatures were only recorded in a few regions, including southwestern Russia and parts of Antarctica,\" the group said.\n\nRead this: Blistering heat and little rain is causing a 'flash drought' in the South\n\nThe data continues Earth's hot streak, with June being the warmest June ever, and July the warmest month in recorded history, according to AFP. August was the second hottest August since records began. This all contributed to the warmest summer on record for the Northern Hemisphere, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n\"The recent series of record-breaking temperatures is an alarming reminder of the long-term warming trend that can be observed on a global level,\" Copernicus Director Jean-Noel Thepaut said to AFP.\n\n\"With continued greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting impact on global temperatures, records will continue to be broken in the future,\" Thepaut said.\n\n\ud83d\udce2 September #temperature highlights from #Copernicus #C3S:\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf21\ufe0fGlobally, this year had the warmest September in our records, although it wasn't much warmer than September 2016\n\n\ud83c\udf21\ufe0fEuropean temperatures above 1981-2010 average in most areas\n\n\n\nMore detail\u27a1\ufe0fhttps://t.co/MCsH6svjxH pic.twitter.com/mvMWhS54Sa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Copernicus ECMWF (@CopernicusECMWF) October 4, 2019\n\nThis year's warmth is occurring without the heat from a strong El Ni\u00f1o event in the tropical Pacific Ocean, according to the Capital Weather Gang. El Ni\u00f1o is a natural climate pattern that often boosts global temperatures by bringing more ocean heat to the surface and adding it to the atmosphere.\n\nA powerful El Ni\u00f1o occurred in 2015 and 2016, contributing to the record heat at that time, the Capital Weather Gang said.\n\nSeptember climate data from both NASA and NOAA, which also track global temperatures, will be released later this month.\n\nUN report: World's oceans and mountains are in big trouble from climate change\n\nYou may like: A Florida bar has removed about $14,000 stapled to its walls to provide hurricane relief in Bahamas\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Global warming: September 2019 was Earth's hottest September on record", "description": "September was so hot, it was actually the hottest ever recorded, especially in central and eastern USA, the Mongolian plateau and parts of the Arctic.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JeLGM4CbAin89WVGRkrv6g--~B/aD0zMzExO3c9NTM4NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/81abbaa510386ea5338ef60d0fb80ff6", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
