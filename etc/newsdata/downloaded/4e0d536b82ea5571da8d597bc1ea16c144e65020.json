Yandex fell as much as 6.8% in Moscow trading Friday, heading for its biggest decline in a year.\n\n\u201cAs global IT corporations are seeking a monopoly and conquering new markets, it\u2019s essential that we retain national companies in this sphere,\u201d Gorelkin said at public hearings on the draft law late Thursday. \u201cIf we say the invisible hand of the market will do everything by itself, then our technology companies may end up in the hands of larger corporations.\u201d\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn\u2019t respond to a request to comment. The Bell online news service earlier reported that the Kremlin supported Gorelkin\u2019s bill, which imposes the same limit on IT companies as the one on Russian media in a 2014 law signed by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nYandex, which has expanded from Russia\u2019s largest search engine to embrace services including taxis and food-delivery, has a free-float of 85% of its shares in the U.S. The draft law would hurt investments and restrict international development for Russian companies if passed in its current form, Yandex General Director Elena Bunina said at the hearings. Oleg Tumanov, founder of Russian online film and TV streaming service Ivi, said the proposed law would kill his company that\u2019s been developing for a decade with help from foreign investors.\n\nIt\u2019s up to the government to determine which companies would be covered by the legislation, though Yandex is likely to be among them, and it may choose to set a higher threshold in individual cases, Gorelkin said on the sidelines of the hearings.\n\n\u2018Good Prospects\u2019\n\nThe measure, which is being prepared for first reading in the lower house of parliament, \u201chas good prospects,\u201d Gorelkin said. It\u2019s supported by the state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, and the Federal Antimonopoly Service, \u201cwhile divisions with the Communication Ministry can be resolved in a working group,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis law is about national security. Data is the new oil,\u201d said Igor Ashmanov, a government-linked IT expert who heads a company specializing in information technology. \u201cWhat\u2019s good about foreign investments? The Russian government is planning to spend billions to develop digital economy.\u201d\n\nWhile Yandex\u2019s founder Arkady Volozh and some of its developers have a special class of shares that gives them voting control in the company, \u201cif something happens - they leave the company or, god forbid, die - these rights disappear and Yandex turns into an American pumpkin,\u201d Ashmanov said.\n\n(Updates with share price decline in second paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Yuliya Fedorinova and Alex Nicholson.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ilya Arkhipov in Moscow at iarkhipov@bloomberg.net;Ilya Khrennikov in Moscow at ikhrennikov@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rebecca Penty at rpenty@bloomberg.net, Tony Halpin, Alex Nicholson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Kremlin is backing a draft law to restrict foreign ownership of Russia\u2019s largest internet company, Yandex NV, and other local tech firms on national security grounds, despite warnings from providers that it will harm their businesses.The presidential administration supports proposals", "authors": ["Ilya Arkhipov", "Ilya Khrennikov"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
