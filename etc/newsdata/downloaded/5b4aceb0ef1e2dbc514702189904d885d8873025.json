The company hopes to offer its flying taxi service at a price only a third higher than the cost of a normal taxi.\n\nFor example, it could cost \u00a346 to complete a 25-mile journey in an ordinary Uber taxi, but \u00a370 using UberAir.\n\nA spokesman said UberAir will make its debut in the American cities of Los Angeles and Dallas in 2023, with global expansion planned in the years after that. It is hoping the taxis may fly in British skies in the next decade, but the UK debut will depend on successful launches in other locations first.\n\nAnd it will probably be more difficult for Uber to launch them in British cities than abroad because of the UK's strict airspace regulations.\n\nThe electric planes, which will fly between 1,000 and 2,000ft above ground, have become 'a core need' in cities where traffic-congested routes are at breaking point, according to Uber.\n\nPilots will fly up to four passengers through 'virtual lanes' after collecting them from the pick-up points. Once the project is completed, users could order and board one of the 'flying cars' in as little as five minutes.\n\nThe company hopes to offer its flying taxi service (pictured) at a price only a third higher than the cost of a normal taxi\n\nThe average flight will be 25 miles. Uber says that such a journey might take 69 minutes in a traditional taxi but 33 minutes using UberAir.\n\nThe flight would be 11 minutes with the rest of the time taken walking or taking a traditional taxi to and from the pick-up and drop-off point.\n\nUber is working with five companies on designs for its flying taxis and is still developing plans on how and if the vehicles would be able to fly in bad weather. The company has conceded that it may need to train a new workforce of pilots. Thomas Prevot, its director of airspace systems, said Uber will initially work with trained ex-commercial airline pilots. But he added: 'As we build this out, we already have a pilot shortage, so we have to find ways to attract and train additional pilots.\n\n'We hope that these vehicles can be flown more simply than helicopters and hopefully, over time, we could have a quicker training programme so that we can increase the pool of people.'\n\nUber was locked in a court battle last summer over whether it was a 'fit and proper' private hire company and should be allowed to continue operating in London. It was put on a 15-month 'probation period' by Transport for London.", "description": "UberAir will make its debut in the American cities of Los Angeles and Dallas in 2023, and is hoping the taxis may fly in British skies in the next decade.", "authors": ["Emily Kent Smith In San Francisco For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/19/01/8716458-0-image-a-19_1547861532557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-19"}
