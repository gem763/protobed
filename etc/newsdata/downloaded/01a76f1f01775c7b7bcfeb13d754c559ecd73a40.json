Reuters\n\nGraham Spooner, an analyst at The Share Centre, said it is \u201cdefinitely plausible\u201d that one reason for the proposed acquisition is the cheapness of the pound, which has been pummelled by Brexit turmoil this year.\n\nWill Howlett, an analyst at Quilter Cheviot, agreed, saying the collapse in the UK currency\u2019s value helps with the financing of deals such as the LSE-HKEX merger.\n\nThe bid for the LSE follows a string of foreign acquisitions of British companies. Last month, US toymaker Hasbro bought the UK-listed owner of Peppa Pig, while Britain\u2019s biggest pub owner Greene King agreed to sell its entire business to CKA, a Hong Kong real estate group.\n\nEarlier this year, Fuller\u2019s, another UK pub group, sold its brewing business to Asahi, Japan\u2019s largest brewer.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It will also \u201cgradually chip away\u201d at Britain\u2019s influence in the financial industry around the world, it added.\n\nThe LSE Group\u2019s shares spiked after the announcement by HKEX but later pared gains to trade around 6 per cent higher on the day.", "description": "The operator of the Hong Kong stock exchange has offered to pay \u00a331.6bn to buy the London Stock Exchange Group, in a surprise move that analysts said was partly driven by the weakness of the pound.
