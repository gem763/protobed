The markets are forgiving some companies like ULTA, Cramer said, and that's why they remain buys.\n\nULTA had a huge gap to the downside last month, so let's see what has happened since then. Our previous thoughts are here . We said, \"This stock will need a long repair process. Avoid.\"\n\nIn the updated daily bar chart of ULTA below, we see that prices are holding in the $240-$225 area and trading volume is down from the gap day but heavier than in the previous months.\n\nThe moving averages are pointed down and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is \"holding on\" in a sideways fashion. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has narrowed and could cross to the upside for a cover-shorts buy signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of ULTA below, the price gap disappears because of the charting of the High, Low and Close. The 40-week moving average line is now pointed down, and so is the weekly OBV line. The MACD oscillator is still in sell mode.\n\nIn the Point and Figure chart of ULTA below, we see a little accumulation but the downside price target remains at $115.\n\nBottom-line strategy: I don't know if I would say that ULTA is clawing its way back, but for now we might say it has stopped falling. I still believe ULTA will need a long repair process before it regains its former beauty.", "description": "Ulta stock may have stopped dropping but it needs more than cosmetic repair....ULTA", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Ulta Beauty Is Still Not Ready To Regain Its Strength", "More Repair Is Needed", "Ulta Stock May Have Stopped Dropping But It Needs More Than Cosmetic Repair.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/afa7f422-b407-11e7-b31e-0f6d69e16ce3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
