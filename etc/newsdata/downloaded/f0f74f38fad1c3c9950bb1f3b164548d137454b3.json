Add Interest\n\nAt an event in the White House Roosevelt Room Friday afternoon, a reporter asked Trump: \u201cMr. President, do you want to clarify what Mick Mulvaney said yesterday?\u201d\n\nTrump replied quickly, \u201cI think he clarified it,\" before pivoting to off-topic comments about his visit to Texas on Thursday.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham appeared on Fox and Friends Friday morning, praising Mulvaney's performance at his briefing Thursday, emphasizing that \u201cwe put a statement out clarifying some of the things that the media got themselves in a tizzy over.\u201d\n\nWhile Mulvaney, in a statement issued Thursday evening after his admission set of a political firestorm, claimed the press had decided to \"misconstrue\" what he had said -- despite reporting using the actual words he spoke in the White House briefing room hours earlier -- the president, who seemingly attacks the so-called \"Fake News\" at nearly every opportunity, did not weigh in further about Mulvaney's admission.\n\nAt midday Thursday, Mulvaney had recounted that the president told him he didn\u2019t want to send Ukraine \u201ca bunch of money and have them waste it, and have them spend it, have them use it to line their own pockets.\u201d\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\n\u201cThose were the driving factors,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters in the White House briefing room. \u201cDid he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that\u2019s it and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d (The \"server\" reference is to a debunked conspiracy theory that Trump has long clung to: that the Democratic National Committee\u2019s hacked email server was being held in Ukraine \u2013 and that individuals in Ukraine were behind an effort to sabotage his 2016 election. Last month, Trump\u2019s own former homeland security adviser called the theory \u201ccompletely false.\u201d )\n\n\u201cSo the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered you to withhold funding to Ukraine?\u201d ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl asked.\n\n\u201c\u2019Look back to what happened in 2016,\u2019 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with the nation,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cAnd that is absolutely equivalent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you described is a quid pro quo,\u201d Karl pressed. \u201cIt is: Funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democrats\u2019 server happens as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney answered.\n\n.@jonkarl: \"To be clear. What you just described is a quid pro quo. It is funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened, as well.\"\n\n\n\nMick Mulvaney: \"We do that all the time with foreign policy.\" https://t.co/oyOq7MJuur pic.twitter.com/eZRtYIeJ0L \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 17, 2019\n\nIn a terse statement issued Thursday evening, Trump's personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said, \"The President's legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's press briefing.\"\n\nAfter hours of backlash, Mulvaney attempted to clarify his comments shortly after Thursday.\n\n\u201cOnce again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump. Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\" Mulvaney noted. \"The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. The only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\"\n\nMulvaney added in the statement that he repeatedly cited the president's interest in \"rooting out corruption in Ukraine, and ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and appropriately\" during the news conference.\n\n\"There was never any connection between the funds and the Ukrainians doing anything with the server - this was made explicitly obvious by the fact that the aid money was delivered without any action on the part of the Ukrainians regarding the server,\" he said. \"There never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d\n\nMulvaney did not mention that a rough White House transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy shows the investigation into alleged corruption Trump and the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, wanted specified a probe of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma where former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, sat on the board.\n\nAsked whether Giuliani's role was problematic, Mulvaney dismissed questions raised about having a private citizen, not a government official, involved in U.S. foreign policy.\n\n\"It is not illegal, it is not impeachable. The president gets to use who he wants to use. If he wants to fire me and hire someone else, he can. The president gets to set foreign policy. He gets to choose who to do so. As long as it does not violate law or laws regarding confidential information or classified material or anything like that the president can use who he wants tom\" he argued.\n\nMulvaney, who stepped into the role of acting chief of staff from his post as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, insisted that an investigation of Joe Biden was not part of the equation, and dismissed the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cThat is going to happen. Elections have consequences and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nWhile previous American presidents have pressured foreign leaders in order to achieve U.S. policy objectives, it has not been considered acceptable that they could do so for the personal benefit they might get from an investigation into political opponents, and many Democrats have said doing so, by itself, is grounds for impeachment.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee and is leading the impeachment investigation, called Mulvaney's blocking of the aid \"illicit.\"\n\n\"With his acknowledgement now that military aid to a vital ally, battling Russia as we speak, was withheld in part out of the desire by the president to have Ukraine investigate the DNC server or Democrats of 2016, things have just gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,\" Schiff said. \"The idea that vital military assistance would be withheld for such a patently political reason, for reason of serving the presidential election campaign, is a phenomenal breach of the president\u2019s duty to defend our national security.\"\n\nABC News' Benjamin Gittleson contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump said his chief of staff clarified his admission of a quid pro quo-- that Trump ordered him to withhold aid until Ukraine agreed to investigate Demcrats.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/president-trump-ap-jef-191018_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
