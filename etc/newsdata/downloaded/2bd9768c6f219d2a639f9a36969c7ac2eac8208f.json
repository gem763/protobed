It would drive me nuts, seriously it was horrible.\n\n\u201cSo now we have the situation that journalists have been relaying some of my stuff, or some comments I said that were negative, to Lewis or even Max...you can imagine journalists must have annoyed him pretty much if he Insta stories about me.\n\n\u201cSo I need to make a little bit of a change there because I don\u2019t want (to upset) those guys, my ex-colleagues, whom I respect a lot.\u201d", "description": "Retired world champion Nico Rosberg has moved to defuse a Formula One spat after his former Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton suggested the German had become \"irrelevant\".", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427578391&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870GQ", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
