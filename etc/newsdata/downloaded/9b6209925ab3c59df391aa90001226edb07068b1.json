Hours after his remarks drew bipartisan criticism, Mulvaney reversed course and said in a statement the money was withheld chiefly over concerns about corruption.\n\nAt a news briefing, Mulvaney said the president told him he was concerned about corruption and the fact that other countries weren't chipping in more to help pay for Ukraine's security. Mulvaney said Trump mentioned \"in passing\" that he considered part of that corruption to involve unfounded claims about the 2016 election.\n\nAmong those claims: Trump sought Ukraine's help in finding out whether a hacked Democratic National Committee server and 33,000 emails from Democrat Hillary Clinton's tenure running the U.S. State Department \"could be\" in the country.\n\n\"Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely,\" Mulvaney said during a briefing at the White House on Thursday, recalling a conversation he had with the president about corruption in Kyiv.\n\n\"That\u2019s it,\" Mulvaney said. \"That\u2019s why we held up the money.\"\n\nMulvaney rows back\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney answers questions during a briefing at the White House October 17, 2019. More\n\nAs Mulvaney's comments bounced around Washington and drew fire from at least one Republican on Capitol Hill, the top aide to Trump issued a statement saying his remarks had been misconstrued to \"advance a biased and political witch hunt.\" Mulvaney said the money was withheld for two reasons: lack of aid from other nations and corruption.\n\n\"Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\" Mulvaney said in the statement. \"The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters as he traveled in Texas, Trump said he did not watch Mulvaney\u2019s briefing but heard he did well.\u2013\n\n\u201cMick is a good man,\" Trump said. \"I have a lot of confidence in him.\"\n\nHouse Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry last month over a phone call in July between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A summary of the call released by the White House showed Trump raised the issue of interference in the 2016 election as well as former Vice President Biden soon after discussing aid to Kyiv.\n\nDemocrats suspect Trump was trying to strong-arm Ukraine into an investigation to discredit political rival Joe Biden.\n\nSondland: Trump ambassador 'disappointed' with Rudy Giuliani's influence in Ukraine\n\nMulvaney said there is nothing wrong with threatening to withhold foreign aid to pressure a country to change a policy \u2013 in this case, he said, to fight corruption.\n\n\"We do that all that time with foreign policy,\" Mulvaney said, noting that the White House threatened to withhold money to Central America over immigration policies.\n\nMick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff, says the Trump administration also threatened to withhold money from Central American countries.
