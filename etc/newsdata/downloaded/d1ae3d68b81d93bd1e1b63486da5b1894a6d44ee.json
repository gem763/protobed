There was full agreement to reach a unanimous, consensual EU27 decision. And there was full agreement to aim to take the decision by written procedure \u2026 Work will continue over the weekend.\u201d\n\nThe diplomatic source added that EU27 diplomats were \u201cexpected to meet early next week to finalise an agreement\u201d and that the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, had \u201cno intention\u201d of calling a summit.\n\nA majority of member states want to accept the terms of an extension reluctantly requested by Johnson, under which Brexit could be delayed until 31 January, but with the opportunity to leave earlier if the withdrawal agreement was ratified in Westminster and by the European parliament.\n\nQuick guide How can Boris Johnson get a general election before January? Show Hide A motion for a general election Boris Johnson has three options to try and call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Johnson could try this again and potentially secure Labour backing, because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit. A one-line bill This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson\u2019s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition. A no-confidence motion The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, can call a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. This needs a simple majority to pass. He has been urged to do this by Johnson several times as a way of triggering an election, but Corbyn has resisted. It begins a 14-day period in which either the prime minister or someone else can try to form a new government. While Johnson could potentially lose this, and therefore his place as prime minister, to another Conservative, Corbyn could also struggle to get enough MPs to rally around him to form a government. The Scottish National party has said it would back him, but the Liberal Democrats have been extremely vocal in saying they would not support him. An election is triggered if, at the end of the two-week period, no alternative government has been formed. Kate Proctor Political correspondent\n\nThose terms had been due to be signed off on Friday. \u201cThere is one country standing in the way \u2013 France,\u201d a diplomat said. \u201cEveryone is very frustrated. They were told that a short extension ran the risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the French, always the French,\u201d said a second senior diplomat. \u201cAnd they never back down.\u201d\n\nSources suggested that Macron, who described Johnson as having \u201cstrategic vision\u201d at a recent summit, was keen to appear helpful to Downing Street by keeping the pressure on MPs.\n\nAs a result, if there is no general election, there remains the possibility that the EU will offer a shorter delay, to mid or late November, merely to allow time for ratification, although sources suggested this remained unlikely. \u201cWe agreed we all want to avoid a no deal \u2013 and a short extension will just raise the possibility,\u201d said an EU source.\n\nBy meddling with the terms of the extension request laid out in the Benn act, the prime minister would also be placed under a different set of obligations. If the three-month extension to 31 January is offered, Johnson will have to agree to it. A different formulation would require parliament to pass a motion endorsing the extension request. Johnson would then need to formally agree to it with the EU by 30 October or within 48 hours, depending on which is earlier.", "description": "Macron\u2019s apparent support of No 10 strategy means decision won\u2019t be made until days before UK due to leave", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/445261d6e4b6d6e6cc737a235bf1eaf6bb451555/0_223_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=868f6d74b808188fd186652bffff282b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
