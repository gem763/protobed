Instagram/Rihana Oksana Petra\n\nDespite barely celebrating their baby\u2019s first month, rumours are now swirling that Kelantan\u2019s Sultan Muhammad V has divorced his Russian wife Rihana, a former beauty queen 24 years his junior.\n\nThe source of these rumours is an alleged copy of the couple\u2019s divorce certificate circulating on social media, which listed it as a \u201ctriple talaq\u201d divorce, according to a report by local broadcaster Astro Awani.\n\nUnder this type of divorce, a Muslim man can divorce his wife instantly by saying the word \u201ctalaq\u201d three times. The couple can then never marry each other again, unless the wife marries another man and is divorced by him a second time.\n\nAccording to Al Jazeera, some Muslim countries, such as Pakistan, have since banned the practice to protect women\u2019s rights.\n\nAccording to a report by The Star, Muhammad V\u2019s father, Sultan Ismail Petra, also divorced his wife using the triple talaq method in 2010.\n\nThe royal couple\u2019s alleged divorce was filed in the Syariah Court of Singapore, the New Straits Times (NST) reported on Wednesday (July 17).\n\nNST\u2019s report cited sources with knowledge of the matter saying the divorce was filed on June 22 and finalised on July 1.\n\nIn January, tabloids reported that the couple\u2019s marriage was on the brink of divorce \u2013 allegations that were quickly shut down by Rihana\u2019s father, Andrei Gorbatenko, and Tatiana Andreyeva-Falk, director of the Miss Moscow pageant.\n\nThe former Miss Moscow even posted a picture of herself and the Sultan on her Instagram page on July 6, just days after their alleged divorce was finalised.\n\nIn the post, she recounted the story of how the Sultan asked her to marry him after inviting her family to visit Malaysia.\n\nThe two first met at a dinner in Europe in 2017, exchanged phone numbers, and subsequently started calling each other every day, she said previously.\n\nThe economics graduate then moved to Kuala Lumpur that same year to study Malaysia\u2019s culture and history, and finally gave up a lucrative modelling contract to be with the Sultan, she later said.\n\n\u201cI will never forget the romantic evening when my future husband confessed that he felt (sic) in love with me from the moment he saw me,\u201d she wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cHe told me that he loved our conversations and would like me to be his wife,\u201d she added, calling the courtship a \u201cbeautiful love story\u201d.\n\nNo official title from Kelantan Palace\n\nDespite the divorce rumors, the Kelantan palace has remained silent on the royal couple\u2019s marital status \u2013 much like during their intensely-speculated wedding ceremony last November, meaning the couple\u2019s union has never been officially announced or recognised.\n\nThis is unlike the official announcement made of the wedding ceremony between Sultan Muhammad V\u2019s younger brother, Tengku Muhammad Faiz Petra, and Swedish national Sofie Louise Johansson in April this year.\n\nSofie has since been given the title Yang Berbahagia Cik Puan \u2013 an honorific for nobility \u2013 in official statements from the Palace.\n\nRihana, however, has not been given an official title or mentioned in any of the Palace\u2019s statements.\n\nIt did, however, issue a statement on Tuesday (July 16) in an apparent response to one of her Instagram posts from July 11, in which she referred to her baby son, Ismail Leon, as the future crown prince of Kelantan and King of Malaysia.\n\nIn the statement, reproduced by Bernama, the Palace clarified that Tengku Muhammad Faiz Petra was Kelantan\u2019s crown prince, not the baby.\n\nIt also called for people to stop referring to \u201ccertain individuals\u201d as the Queen of Kelantan without the title being officially conferred.\n\nObservers speculate that the statement was targeted at Rihana.\n\nOn the Instagram post in question, she confessed to feeling \u201chappy\u201d to have made \u201cthe right choice\u201d to be with the Sultan whenever she looked at her baby.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - After marrying barely a year ago, Kelantan's Sultan Muhammad V, 50 and wife Rihana Oksana Petra, 27, have reportedly split..
