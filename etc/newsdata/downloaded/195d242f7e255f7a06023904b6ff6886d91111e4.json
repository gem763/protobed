The rapid-fire shifts have investors yearning for stability \u2013 after all, investing is about making a profit, and profits are more likely in a stable, upward-trending environment.\n\nFortunately, some stocks are prepped to deliver profits whether the markets go up or down. Dividends represent income for shareholders, paid out regardless of general market conditions, and there are plenty of stocks out there which pay out handsomely.\n\nWe\u2019ve used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener to search the market for Strong Buy-rated investments with reliable high-yield dividend payouts \u2013 and a low cost of entry. With these attributes, a profit-minded investor will have to look twice.\n\nNew Residential Investment (NRZ)\n\nOur first stock to look at, and the one with the highest-yielding dividend, is a real estate investment trust \u2013 a company that owns various properties and uses them to generate income. Under US tax law, these companies are heavily incentivized to pay out 90% or more of their income in the form of dividends. This makes the REIT a go-to stock sector for profit-oriented investors.\n\nBased in New York, New Residential operates across the real estate industry, with portfolio holding in mortgage servicing, real estate securities, residential and commercial loans, and corporate properties. The company\u2019s holdings total over $600 billion in value, and generate more than $960 million in net income from $2.37 billion in annual revenues.\n\nThe recent interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve have impacted NRZ\u2019s bottom line, as the company is heavily invested in the mortgage sector. However, like most REITs, New Residential has a high cash flow and can easily maintain its dividend payment. At $0.50 per quarter, that payment may look small \u2013 but the stock is priced at just $14.98, making the annual dividend yield a robust 13.35%. For comparison, the average stock on the S&P 500 yields a 2% dividend.\n\nNRZ\u2019s profit potential has drawn positive attention from Wall Street\u2019s analysts. Initiating coverage of the stock with a Buy rating, BTIG\u2019s Giuliano Bologna wrote, \u201c\u2026we believe investors should focus on NRZ\u2019s unique portfolio of assets, the buildout of recapture capabilities and ancillary services that should improve the overall return\u2026\u201d Referring to the company\u2019s dividend and cash flow, he added, \u201cWe believe NRZ has sufficient cash flow to maintain the company\u2019s quarterly dividend of $0.50 and will benefit from additional cash flow contribution from call rights and the securitization/sale of originated loans during 2H19.\u201d In line with his bullish outlook, Bologna set an $18 price target on the stock, indicating confidence in a 20% upside. (To watch Bologna's track record, click here)\n\nFurthermore, Piper Jaffray\u2019s 5-star analyst Kevin Barker also gave this stock a Buy rating. He said in his note, \u201c\u2026slight pressure to New Residential's tangible book value in Q3 is more than priced into the shares. Further, recent acquisitions are further evidence New Residential will continue to build out an operating company that will attempt to squeeze out revenue from all touch points on its large portfolio.\u201d\n\nOverall, New Residential has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus. This is derived from 4 buys assigned in the last two months \u2013 so the consensus is unanimous. As indicated above, the stock sells for $14.98. The average price target is $18, which implies room for 20% upside growth.
