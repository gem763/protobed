WeWork's postponement of its initial-public offering coincides with a shift out of highly valued \"growth\" stocks in public markets.\n\nOne strategist said it was too soon to tell whether the recent rotation out of highly valued tech stocks into value stocks was the beginning of a long-term trend. \"I think there are a lot of parallels between the current market environment and the late 90s but in almost every case they're far less extreme,\" said Craig Birk, chief investment officer at digital financial advisory Personal Capital, noting that the WeWork situation reflected some \"froth\" in markets. \"It's too soon to say if there has been a style rotation because there's been a number of counter-trend moves over the last few years. The trend is still growth, still mega-cap and still tech.\" Even if temporary, the shift into value could help \"investors realize that one part of the market never leads forever,\" said Mr. Birk.\n\nIn an echo of the events at We Cos., where Chief Executive Adam Neumann quit abruptly, another real-estate tech company backed by Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group, online broker Compass, is contending with an exodus of top executives, with chief operating officer Maelle Gavet the latest to leave.\n\nEBay Chief Executive Devin Wenig has left the online marketplace citing conflicts with the company's new board, which is overseeing a strategic review of the business after demands from activist investors for a breakup.\n\nWrite to Rob Curran at rob.curran@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 25, 2019 17:11 ET (21:11 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
