They\u2019d eat him alive. Unless, of course, he did nothing to block their agenda, in which case he\u2019d be left alone like all the other cowardly roll-over Republicans.\n\nThe American people chose a barbarian for president because they knew only a barbarian could drain the Washington swamp.\n\nAnd, judging by the president\u2019s unchanged approval ratings since House Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry, not to mention his record donation take on the back of it, Trump fans are with him for the long haul, no matter how boorishly he behaves.\n\nThey see him implementing his agenda against all odds. If the swamp gets in his way, Trump bulldozes over it. Supreme Court, tick. Taxes cut, tick. Regulations slashed, tick. Jobs up, tick. Military rebuilt, tick. ISIS stopped, tick. Globalism challenged, tick. Paris climate treaty scrapped, tick. Borders strengthened, tick. Wall built, half-tick.\n\nAll while the Washington establishment tries to sabotage his presidency and the liberal media reviles him.\n\nHe is Teflon Don, energized by a battle that would have broken a genteel Republican long ago.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Dems are afraid and it\u2019s why they\u2019re projecting like crazy. This is the disease of the left.\n\nThe legendary Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud defined \u201cprojection\u201d as a psychological defense mechanism in which people repress their own shameful thoughts and impulses by attributing them to others.\n\nAlso known as \u201cshame-dumping,\u201d projection is a form of denial, or \u201cnegation,\u201d as Freud called it in a 1925 paper.\n\nExamples of Freudian projection include a rude person accusing others of being rude or an adulterer accusing his wife of cheating on him.\n\nThe psychiatric bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, says projection shifts your \u201cown undesirable thoughts, motivations, desires, feelings onto someone else.\u201d\n\nIt may help you deal with \u201cunconscious feelings of shame and inadequacy,\u201d according to a 2017 paper on \u201cmaladaptive personalities\u201d in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.\n\nsee also Trump has snit fit over \u2018ass\u2019 Mitt Romney President Trump lashed out at Sen. Mitt Romney as a...\n\nSo, when you hear liberals constantly accuse their ideological enemies, without evidence, of such thought crimes as racism, sexism, xenophobia and bigotry, chances are they\u2019re projecting.\n\nIn the case of Democrats, they constantly accuse Trump of sins they have themselves committed.\n\nFor example, Joe Biden wrote a weekend op-ed accusing Trump of \u201cabusing the power of the presidency \u2026 He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal interests.\u201d\n\nYet Biden is in denial about allegations that he abused the power of the vice presidency to advance his son\u2019s personal interests.\n\nAt the very least, \u201cQuid Pro Joe,\u201d as Twitter has dubbed him, had a conflict of interest when, in 2014, shortly after he visited Ukraine as vice president to urge increased production of natural gas, his son Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, and was paid $50,000 a month despite having no discernible expertise.\n\nBut Biden was outraged when he was quizzed about the conflict of interest by reporters in Los Angeles last week: \u201cI\u2019m not going to respond to that. Let\u2019s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing that no president has ever done.\u201d\n\nClassic projection.\n\nOr take House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, caught fibbing to \u201cMorning Joe\u201d two weeks ago over Trump\u2019s call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d\n\nTurns out Schiff knew about the whistleblower\u2019s concerns days before the complaint was filed about Trump\u2019s not-so-perfect call. One of his staffers even advised the whistleblower, according to the New York Times.\n\nYet Schiff is the guy who spent the past two years accusing Trump of \u201cdeception\u201d and \u201ccollusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen accusing others of lying, best not to misrepresent facts yourself,\u201d he tweeted last year.\n\nClassic projection.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday branded Trump an anti-Semite for criticizing Schiff. Yet she tosses around terms like \u201cconcentration camp\u201d for political effect and never calls out fellow Squad sisters Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, who trade in such anti-Semitic rhetoric that they were banned from visiting Israel and even chastised by Democratic heavy Jerry Nadler.\n\nClassic projection.\n\nThen there is #MeToo. It\u2019s hard to ignore how many high-profile perverts are liberals who bought themselves protection by mouthing liberal platitudes and funding Democratic causes.\n\nHollywood is the most liberal enclave in America, yet the Sony Pictures hack attack of 2014 exposed the racism and sexism under the politically correct facade. Here were studio executives proudly contributing to President Barack Obama\u2019s campaigns while making racist jokes about him with colleagues.\n\nLiberals are obsessed with identity politics yet stoke racial tensions to gain power. They are obsessed with diversity yet impose a stifling intellectual conformity on our cultural institutions.\n\nIn their frenzied projection of their own flaws onto the president, their Freudian slips are showing.\n\nOutrage should\u2019ve been swift\n\nAOC didn\u2019t know if she was being pranked when a woman at her Queens district town hall wailed that we should be \u201ceating babies\u201d to avert climate catastrophe.\n\n\u201cWe only have a few months left,\u201d the distraught audience member said in a video that has gone viral. \u201cI love that you support the Green Deal, but it\u2019s not going to get rid of fossil fuel \u2026 fast enough \u2026 So, I think your next campaign slogan needs to be this: \u2018We\u2019ve got to start eating babies.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe fringe right-wing LaRouche PAC soon declared it was a prank.\n\nBut AOC\u2019s initial response was instructive. She didn\u2019t dismiss the idea of infant cannibalism as repellent, but humored the woman with a neutral answer.\n\n\u201cWell, we have more than a few months,\u201d she said, as if it were simply timing that ruled against baby-eating.\n\n#HeToo a #MeToo victim\n\nNewspaper icon Bob Woodward did a couple of New York Times authors a favor last week by helping launch their #MeToo book, \u201cShe Said,\u201d at a Washington, DC, literary event.\n\nHe sat onstage with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey and interviewed them about their investigation into sexual assault allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. But, proving that no good deed goes unpunished, Woodward was heckled and shouted down by snowflakes in the audience for asking probing questions, including about Weinstein\u2019s motivation, which you would think would be an essential part of the story.\n\nCommitting actual journalism is a fraught business these days", "description": "Genteel Republicans like Mitt Romney complain about Donald Trump\u2019s unpresidential behavior but how else does he combat the dirty left?", "authors": ["Miranda Devine", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mitt-romney.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
