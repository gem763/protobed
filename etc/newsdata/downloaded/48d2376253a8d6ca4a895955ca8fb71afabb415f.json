Germany, France and Italy have always had a seat on the six-member body that designs monetary policy.\n\nKey lawmakers from Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a female candidate is likely, and mentioned Isabel Schnabel, an economic adviser to the government, or Bundesbank Vice President Claudia Buch. Lautenschlaeger is the only woman on the ECB\u2019s 25-person Governing Council.\n\nBut hovering over the whole process are questions of political affiliation and German frustration with years of negative interest rates. The administration must decide whether it wants a traditional central banker, a politician with economic heft, or maybe an academic steeped in policy.\n\nThe Bundesbank, just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the ECB in Frankfurt, is the traditional place to start. It was the blueprint for the euro zone\u2019s currency guardian and provided the institution\u2019s first two chief economists in Otmar Issing and Juergen Stark. Lautenschlaeger was the Bundesbank\u2019s vice president.\n\nIt\u2019s also a hotbed of discontent with loose policy though. Stark quit in 2011 after disagreeing with the institution\u2019s bond-buying program. On the ECB\u2019s Governing Council, made up of the board and the national central-bank chiefs, Bundesbank President Axel Weber resigned the same year. Current head Jens Weidmann has been a persistent critic of ECB President Mario Draghi\u2019s policies, leading to friction between the two men.\n\n\u201cThe natural breeding ground has changed and it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be the Bundesbank this time,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING-DiBa AG in Frankfurt. \u201cI\u2019d definitely go for someone with a strong economic background, but also if you want to have influence on the next ECB, it\u2019s important to have a person who\u2019s less of a hawk and more cooperative in his or her approach to policy.\u201d\n\nShould Germany decide to nominate a woman, the Bundesbank does present an option in Buch, who\u2019s been there five years. The 53-year-old economist already attends ECB Governing Council meetings and is responsible for overseeing financial stability in Germany.\n\nAnother option is to look among Germany\u2019s political classes. That was the route taken with Joerg Asmussen, a finance ministry official at the time who joined the ECB board in 2012 and took on the role of international cooperation. He also left early, serving just two years of his eight-year term to return to government.\n\nThat precedent could cast the spotlight on someone like Jakob von Weizsaecker, the finance ministry\u2019s chief economist and a former European Parliament lawmaker. Party politics would need to be overcome as he\u2019s affiliated with the Social Democrats, who run the ministry in Germany\u2019s coalition.\n\nAcademic Advisers\n\nAlternatively, the government could consider tapping one of the experts from its council of economic advisers. Schnabel is a University of Bonn economist and an expert on financial supervision and banking regulation.\n\nVolker Wieland, a colleague of Schnabel\u2019s on the council and a professor at Goethe University in Frankfurt, could be in the running. His resume includes a PhD from Stanford and five years at the Federal Reserve. He\u2019s the host of an annual conference called the ECB and Its Watchers, which draws the central bank\u2019s big hitters.\n\nEconomic research centers such as the Ifo institute in Munich or ZEW in Mannheim, headed by Clemens Fuest and Achim Wambach respectively, might get a cursory consideration.\n\nAnother name is Marcel Fratzscher, who runs the DIW Berlin think tank and was previously the head of International Policy Analysis at the ECB. His hurdle might be his frequent criticism of the German economic model and his defense of Draghi\u2019s policies -- stances unlikely to win him plaudits in conservative German circles.\n\nIn the private sector, Elga Bartsch is head of macro research at BlackRock Inc (NYSE: )., with a long career of covering the euro-area economy and markets. A paper she co-wrote recently with two former central bankers argued for more explicitly coordinated monetary and fiscal policy, a radical version of what both Draghi and his successor from Nov. 1, Christine Lagarde, are advocating.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how such a world view would go down with the German government, which has so far resisted calls to step up its own spending and has a deep culture of separating monetary and fiscal policy. A different approach may be to put someone forward who will continue to push the German line that excessive monetary stimulus is counterproductive.\n\n\u201cA year from now there could be a debate within the council over stopping QE,\u201d said Richard Barwell, head of macro research at BNP Paribas (PA: ) Asset Management in London. \u201cParachuting in a highly respected and persuasive expert on monetary policy who is able to challenge the dovish arguments of colleagues could tip the balance in that discussion.\u201d", "description": "Germany Starts Hunt for a Central Banker Who Can Stick With ECB", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picd12dbde0cd7cabcc9d31da855d153101.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
