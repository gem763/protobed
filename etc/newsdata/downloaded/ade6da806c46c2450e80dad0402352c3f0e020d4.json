If you're feeling pressured, say something like, 'Sorry for being stupid, but I'm going to need to slow you down so I can make sense of what you're saying,'\" Dalio recommends. \"Then ask your questions. All of them.\"\n\nDalio gives other recommendations for keeping discussions productive in addition to slowing down fast-talkers. For example, he suggests a \"two-minute rule\" to avoid \"persistent interruptions.\"\n\nWith the two-minute rule, each person in the conversation is ensured two uninterrupted minutes to explain their point of view before anyone else jumps in with their own thoughts or opinion.\n\n\"This ensures that everyone has time to fully crystallize and communicate their thoughts without worrying they will be misunderstood or drowned out by a louder voice,\" Dalio says.\n\nClear communication is a critical component of Dalio's overarching framework for running Bridgewater Associates, which he says is an \"idea meritocracy,\" or an organization where all opinions are heard and the best idea wins, no matter who it came from.\n\n\"Thoughtful disagreement \u2014 the process of having a quality back-and-forth in an open-minded and assertive way so as to see things through each other's eyes \u2014 is more powerful because it helps both parties see things they've been blind to,\" Dalio writes in \"Principles.\" \"But it's not easy.\"\n\nSee also:\n\nRay Dalio reveals the 'most important thing you need to do' to be a successful investor\n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio: U.S. economy must change or there will be 'conflict' between the rich and poor\n\nRay Dalio had CEOs like Bill Gates and Elon Musk take a personality test\u2014here's what he found that makes them so successful", "description": "People who talk exceptionally quickly do so as \"a way of pushing their agenda past other people's examination or objections,\" the financier and entrepreneur Ray Dalio says.", "authors": ["Catherine Clifford"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106097085-1566833927020gettyimages-1137694037.jpeg?v=1566834039"}
