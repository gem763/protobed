Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It is co-chaired by Democratic Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.).\n\nOf the 96 House members listed on the CPC\u2019s website, 70 have voiced support for an impeachment inquiry, according to a Washington Post analysis. Twenty-four members of the group say congressional committees should continue their existing investigations into Trump\u2019s administration and personal finances, while one member\u2019s position is unclear. Another member of the group, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, represents the District in Congress but does not have a vote in the House.\n\nOverall, a majority of House Democrats support impeachment. Congress returned to Washington this week after its summer break, and the House Judiciary Committee is expected to activate rare authorities that people familiar with the matter have described as a first step toward potentially impeaching the president.\n\nJM Rieger contributed to this report.", "description": "The move adds to the momentum for an impeachment investigation, even as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opposes one.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GR4h3Wpzh5jdKKWwj0ZxW-0aDnw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VCN7GNBEAII6TNNUDUMN7N5QQQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
