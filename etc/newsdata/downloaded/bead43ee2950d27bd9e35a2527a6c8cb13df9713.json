Later, protesters hurled rocks at the glass. Down the street among luxury shops, demonstrators lighted a fire in front of another station entrance.\n\nEven an institution so central to daily life in Hong Kong as the subway is finding it difficult to navigate the city\u2019s increasingly polarized political atmosphere.\n\nFor weeks this summer, the hyper-efficient and super-clean MTR\u2014after its initial name, Mass Transit Railway\u2014was an important asset for hit-and-run protesters, providing a quick way to move from place to place and escape police.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What repercussions do you foresee in the city if the subway system is compromised? Join the conversation below.\n\nBut protesters turned strongly against subway operator MTR Corp. in late August, when the company got a court order to help it prevent vandalism and interference at its stations, signaling a tougher stance against the demonstrators. That same day an English-language column in the Global Times, a state-run tabloid in China, criticized the subway operator for assisting protesters, feeding protester suspicions that the company was feeling pressure from Beijing.\n\nSince then, the company has frequently shut down stations near demonstration sites.\n\nProtesters accuse the subway operator, 75%-owned by the Hong Kong government, of aligning with the authorities. They have called for a boycott of the system and protests at malls and other properties owned by MTR.\n\nTensions have been further inflamed by video posted online that shows police beating people in a subway car. Protesters have berated MTR for not releasing all of the station surveillance footage from Aug. 31, the day of the alleged beating.\n\nWhat started off as a demonstration against a controversial extradition bill has become a series of massive protests with broad political demands. Here is why so many Hong Kongers keep taking to the streets in a leaderless movement and whether their goals can be achieved.

Others have called the train system \u201cCommunist Party rail,\u201d which rhymes with the MTR\u2019s name in Cantonese.\n\nLast weekend alone at least nine stations were heavily vandalized\u2014entry and exit gates, ticket machines and surveillance cameras smashed by small groups of hard-core protesters.\n\nAt a station where riot police had recently deployed last weekend, a man surnamed Lung said, \u201cWe just try to do whatever we can to hurt them, to let them know that they are serving Hong Kong people, they are not serving the Communists and China.\u2026We should smash all the stations.\u201d\n\nMr. Lung, in his late 20s and not wearing protest gear, said he hasn\u2019t committed any vandalism himself. He added later that he\u2019s not happy to see stations smashed\u2014but that protesters had previously tried to express their views peacefully.\n\nMTR, which is publicly traded, says it closes stations when the safety of passengers and employees is threatened. On Sunday, company Chief Executive Jacob Kam and Chairman Rex Auyeung issued an open letter urging an end to vandalism: \u201cAt this crucial moment, we wish all sectors of the community could treasure and safeguard this railway network.\u201d\n\nThe company, which also runs train systems in the U.K., Australia, Sweden and mainland China, didn\u2019t respond to a request for further comment. Hong Kong officials said the government doesn\u2019t interfere in MTR\u2019s operations.\n\nAs Hong Kong braced for its 15th weekend of unrest, the MTR canceled the all-night service it was to have offered Friday for China\u2019s mid-autumn festival, a major holiday. Also Friday, a government panel upheld a police ban on two pro-democracy assemblies planned for the weekend.\n\nKathy Yeung said she is boycotting the subway in favor of a bus to work, even though it can take twice as long.

Hong Kong\u2019s leader eventually pledged to withdraw the bill, but in the interim the focus of protests had broadened.\n\nDemonstrators are now calling for democratic reform and investigations of police tactics, which have included the use of tear gas, projectiles and water cannon. On Sunday, tear gas was deployed in a popular shopping district, catching passersby in the plumes. Tear gas has even been fired inside a subway station.\n\nBy a makeshift memorial at the entrance to the Prince Edward MTR\u2014site of the Aug. 31 incident\u2014a veterinary nurse named Kathy Yeung said that she was boycotting the system. She had started commuting to work by bus, though it takes 45 minutes, compared with just 20 to 30 minutes by train.\n\nSuspending train service during a protest provides police an excuse for arrests, Ms. Yeung said, because it prevents protesters from leaving. The police can say, \u201c\u2018You guys are an illegal gathering,\u2019\u201d she said, while protesters say \u201c\u2018We want to go home, but you don\u2019t let us.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Yeung, in her early 30s, held a sign imploring the rail operator to release the Aug. 31 surveillance video.\n\nLee Hun, heading for a train to meet a friend, said he didn\u2019t like the vandalism, adding it will ultimately be riders who pay for it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no end I can see,\u201d said Mr. Lee, in his late 40s. \u201cIt just makes me sad. Not only for the protesters, not [only] for the policemen. I\u2019m kind of sad for both of them.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com", "description": "Hong Kong protesters accuse the city\u2019s subway operator, 75%-owned by the local government, of aligning with the authorities\u2014and have made the system a target of their anger.", "authors": ["Mike Cherney", "Mike.Cherney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106898/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
