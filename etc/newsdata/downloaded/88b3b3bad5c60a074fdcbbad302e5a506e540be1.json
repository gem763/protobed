In the game, STRIKE!: The Game of Worker Rebellion, \u201cplayers will grow their ranks, mobilize workers, and organize strikes around their city.\u201d\n\nThe campaign for the board game, which creators describe as a \u201ccompletely and unabashedly a pro-labor rights game,\u201d arrives, ironically, at a moment when Kickstarter employees are in the midst of their own bitter union drive.\n\nWithin two weeks in September, two of Kickstarter\u2019s union\u2019s lead organizers were fired and a third phased out. Now the company, which has situated itself as a progressive outlier from Silicon Valley tech companies, faces a federal complaint for allegedly retaliating against union organizers, and has declined the union\u2019s request for voluntary recognition. Kickstarter\u2019s newly appointed CEO Aziz Hasan has denied that the firings were related to union organizing, but said that a \u201cunion framework is inherently adversarial.\u201d\n\nAt a tense company-wide meeting on October 9, union members held signs reading \u201cCard Checks Are Democratic\u201d and \u201cRecognize Kickstarter United,\u201d while top leadership presented at the company\u2019s headquarters in Brooklyn and welcomed a new board member, according to a current Kickstarter employee who wished to remain anonymous. Kickstarter\u2019s union would be the first white collar union at a major tech company in the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to ignore the similarities between the objectives of a dystopian board game about worker rebellion under monopoly capitalism, and Kickstarter employees\u2019 own struggle to unionize. The ironies have not been lost of the game\u2019s creators: The two groups behind the game, the TESA Collective and Jobs With Justice, have expressed solidarity with Kickstarter\u2019s union.\n\n\u201cMany workers at Kickstarter are currently working to organize a union and have faced opposition from Kickstarter management,\u201d the creators write on their crowdfunding page. \u201cThis Kickstarter campaign completely supports the efforts of the workers, as we rely on the labor that runs this platform!\u201d\n\n\"We fully support our staff's right to decide for themselves if they want a union,\" a company spokesperson told Motherboard. \"Our staff members have expressed starkly different opinions on unionization over the last seven months. A secret-ballot election will fairly and democratically resolve this debate and ensure that all voices are heard.\"\n\nWithin the first day of the campaign\u2019s launch, the creators raised over $12,000 of the $22,000 goal. The premise of the game is that the richest company in the world, HappyCorp, releases a plan to transform Mercury City into an entirely corporate run metropolis, privatizing everything from schools to sidewalks, and abolishing all public services, the minimum wage, and unions. Workers must organize across sectors to save the city.", "description": "At Kickstarter, a new dystopian board game about worker rebellion and the company\u2019s own union busting campaign share some ironic similarities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daf2a753075cc000aa68f2d/lede/1571760968975-Full-board-action-shot-credit-Aaron-Simmons.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8444xh;0xw,0.1024xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
