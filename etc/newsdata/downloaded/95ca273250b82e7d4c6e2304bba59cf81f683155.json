The DNC, the complaint alleges, \u201ctasked Chalupa with obtaining incriminating or derogatory information about Donald Trump \u2026 [and] Paul Manfort.\u201d\n\nIn May, Fox News reported that the UkrainianEembassy confirmed that Chalupa had pushed for Ukrainian officials to publicly mention Manafort\u2019s financial and political ties to the country. The disgraced former lobbyist is currently serving more than seven years in prison for financial fraud related to his work in Ukraine.\n\nChalupa, according to the complaint, sought to have the Ukrainian government provide her information about Manafort\u2019s work in the country. She was encouraged by the DNC to meet with former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to gain insight that would theoretically boost Hillary Clinton\u2019s bid for president.\n\n\u201cThe White House has been pushing this narrative to distract from Donald Trump\u2019s gross abuse of power in pressuring a foreign country to interfere in our elections. No one is buying it.\u201d \u2014 Adrienne Watson - Democratic National Committee\n\n\u201cThe embassy got to know Ms. Chalupa because of her engagement with Ukrainian and other diasporas in Washington, D.C., and not in her DNC capacity,\u201d said former Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Valeriy Chaly in a statement. \u201cWe were surprised to see Alexandra\u2019s interest in Mr. Paul Manafort\u2019s case. It was her own cause.\u201d\n\nKen Vogel, a New York Times reporter who wrote about the story for Politico in 2017, tweeted that Chalupa wasn\u2019t representing the DNC during her meetings with Ukrainian officials. That point is overlooked in the complaint, which alleges that acquiring something of value in a political campaign from a foreign government is a violation of campaign finance.\n\n\u201cThe White House has been pushing this narrative to distract from Donald Trump\u2019s gross abuse of power in pressuring a foreign country to interfere in our elections,\u201d said Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the DNC. \u201cNo one is buying it.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is signed by Dan Backer, a lawyer well-known in conservative circles for his legal work around campaign finance \u2013 often against Democrats. This year, he\u2019s filed FEC complaints against Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Joaquin Castro, D-Texas. Previously, he\u2019s founded political action committees against Ocasio-Cortez and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\n\u201cIt really comes down to the hypocrisy of the Democrats. It\u2019s the same thing they\u2019ve been doing year in and year out. \u2026 It\u2019s that kind of hypocrisy that I think really frustrates Americans.\u201d \u2014 Dan Backer - Committee to Defend the President\n\nBacker is listed as the treasurer for the Committee to Defend the President PAC, the organization behind the complaint, on the Federal Election Commission website. Backer said the Chalupa complaint has been on his radar for some time, and this seemed a good time to file \u2013 given the recent impeachment inquiry against Trump undertaken by House Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt really comes down to the hypocrisy of the Democrats,\u201d Backer said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing they\u2019ve been doing year in and year out. \u2026 It\u2019s that kind of hypocrisy that I think really frustrates Americans.\u201d\n\nThe complaint, like his others, will likely be stuck in limbo for the foreseeable future as the FEC doesn\u2019t currently have enough commissioners to legally meet \u2013 rendering it toothless. After the resignation of former Vice Chairman Matthew S. Petersen in August, the agency is left with just three commissioners, one short of a quorum and three short of a full roster.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s abundantly clear that they only care about breaking the rules when they can point their fingers at somebody else that they think is doing it,\u201d said Backer.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "The Democratic National Committee has been hit with a Federal Election Commission complaint that accuses a former DNC contractor of acting\u00a0improperly to gather information on Paul Manafort and Donald Trump in the 2016 election, according to a copy of the complaint given to Fox News.", "authors": ["Andrew Keiper", "Adrienne Watson - Democratic National Committee", "Dan Backer - Committee To Defend The President"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Manafort.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
