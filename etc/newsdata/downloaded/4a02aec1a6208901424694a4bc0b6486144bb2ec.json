Mohammad Amir, Wahab Riaz, and Mohammad Hasnain are likely to make up the pace bowling unit.\n\nThe inexperienced squad of Sri Lanka will know that they will have their work cut out once they face the hosts.\n\nUnder the stand-in captain Lahiru Thirimanne, the visitors will have work with players who have been in and out of the squad for the past few years. It is not sure what sort of a combination would they bring on the field for the second ODI.\n\nAs it has been raining in Karachi for the past few days, it can be predicted that there could be some swing for the bowlers early on in the innings. But considering the stats of the group, it can be expected that the pitch will get much better for batting during the later stages of the game.", "description": "PTV Sports and Ten Sports will jointly broadcast the match live in Pakistan.
