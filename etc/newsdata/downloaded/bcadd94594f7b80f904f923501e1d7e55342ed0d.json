Vienna scores \u201ca near perfect\u201d 99.1 out of 100, the Economist unit writes in its report. Vienna is followed closely by Melbourne, Australia, which for years dominated this list.\n\nHere\u2019s the top 10:\n\n1. Vienna, Austria\n\n2. Melbourne, Australia\n\n3. Sydney, Australia\n\n4. Osaka, Japan\n\n5. Calgary, Canada\n\n6. Vancouver, Canada\n\n7. Toronto, Canada\n\n7. Tokyo, Japan\n\n9. Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n10. Adelaide, Australia\n\nNo U.S. city cracked the top 20, with Honolulu ranking highest at No. 22. Atlanta came in 33rd place; Pittsburgh, 34th; and Seattle, 36th. New York landed all the way down in the 58th spot, in part because of low scores for infrastructure, stability and possible crime issues.\n\nOn the plus side, \u201coverall, scores have gone up since last year. In all, 27 cities have become more liveable by the EIU\u2019s reckoning, whereas 15 saw their scores fall,\u201d the Economist unit writes. \u201cThe biggest improvement came in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, which rose 20 places to 69th \u2014 but that owed much to investments in health care and infrastructure after the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017.\u201d\n\nThis EIU rating isn\u2019t the only one to give U.S. cities relatively low ratings. A 2019 quality-of-life ranking from global consulting firm Mercer also gave Vienna the top spot on its list, followed by Zurich, with Auckland, Munich and Vancouver tying for third place.\n\nMercer ranks hundreds of cities on a number of factors, including recreation, housing, economy, public services and transport, political and social environment, education, medical and health considerations, and the natural environment.\n\nOn Mercer\u2019s list, no U.S. city even made it into the top 30. In 34th place was San Francisco, followed closely by Boston, at No. 36; Honolulu, at No. 37; New York, at No. 44; and Seattle, at No. 46.\n\nTo be sure, by other metrics, U.S. localities have plenty of fans, with, for example, the Time Out City Life Index placing Chicago at the top of the ranks of cities that \u201chave it all\u201d for two years running and the World Economic Forum putting the United States in first place globally for business climate.", "description": "But Canada and Australia both have three cities in the top 10 on the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s new list", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ676_vienna_ZG_20190904125150.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
