Much as I would love Wales to reach the final, I make South Africa favourites to win that semi-final.\n\nIn the meantime, we can only thank Japan for everything they have brought to the tournament: their handling skills, passing and pace.\n\nIt was like watching rugby for the first time again and falling in love with the sport afresh.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: We can only thank Japan for everything they have brought to the tournament: their handling skills, passing and pace.
