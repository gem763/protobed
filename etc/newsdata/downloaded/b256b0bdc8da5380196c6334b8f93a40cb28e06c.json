'I try to enjoy it and give my best whether it's with Wales or Madrid.\n\n'There is nothing to clear my mind about. I love meeting up with Wales, and we have a task at hand to try to qualify for the Euros.'\n\nBale did not feature in Real's disappointing Champions League draw with Club Brugge last week but returned for the league victory over Granada last weekend.\n\nCoach Ryan Giggs said: 'I was surprised with what happened in the summer - I think everyone from the outside thought it was a bit strange. But it seems like everything on that has gone a bit quiet now.\n\nHe has helped Real Madrid to the top of the La Liga table but has rarely looked happy doing so\n\n'Of course, it would have unsettled him because it was apparently very close for him going. But things might have changed. Things do change quite quickly in football and now he's playing, he's loved, he's happy, and I expect him to carry on doing what he's doing for Real Madrid.'\n\nGiggs is again without Aaron Ramsey, who has not featured at all in qualifying, for a game where Wales have little margin for error if they want to keep alive their hopes of automatic qualification.\n\nThe Juventus midfielder has a thigh problem but did some light training on Wednesday and Wales hope he may be involved against Croatia on Sunday.\n\nThere are also injury doubts over forwards Harry Wilson and Tom Lawrence. Giggs insisted Lawrence is in the right frame of mind to play, with the Derby forward scheduled to appear before magistrates on October 15 after he was charged with drink-driving.", "description": "Gareth Bale appeared to be heading for the exit in the summer - with a \u00a31m a week contract with Jiangsu Suning on the table - after his relationship with Zinedine Zidane hit rock bottom.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/21/19509548-0-image-a-72_1570652377054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
