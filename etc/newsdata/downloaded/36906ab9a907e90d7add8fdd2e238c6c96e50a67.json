In addition to the two weeks of incarceration, the judge fined her $30,000 and said she would be on supervised release for one year. Huffman will also have to complete 250 hours of community service.\n\nLegend, 40, reacted to the sentence in a series of tweets on Saturday. The musician appeared to address the backlash from those who believe Huffman\u2019s sentence should have been stricter, citing harsher punishments given to people of color, including Tanya McDowell, who was sentenced to five years in prison for charges connected to sending her child to the wrong school district, according to the Connecticut Post.\n\n\u201cI get why everyone gets mad when rich person X gets a short sentence and poor person of color Y gets a long one,\u201d the singer wrote. \u201cThe answer isn\u2019t for X to get more; it\u2019s for both of them to get less (or even none!!!) We should level down not up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up,\u201d he continued. \u201cPrisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we\u2019ve come to use them to address nearly every societal ill.\u201d\n\nAmericans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up.

It should be ZERO.\u201d\n\nThe Voice star concluded, \u201cAnd no one in our nation will benefit from the 14 days an actress will serve for cheating in college admissions. We don\u2019t need to lock people up for any of this stuff.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Felicity Huffman \u2018Humbled\u2019 by 14-Day Sentence: She Hopes \u2018Public Will Give Her a Second Chance\u2019\n\nIt's unconscionable that we locked a woman up for voting when, unbeknownst to her, she was ineligible. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 14, 2019\n\nAnd no one in our nation will benefit from the 14 days an actress will serve for cheating in college admissions.
