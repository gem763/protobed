It will cost $149 and begin shipping Nov. 5.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of Portal TV is the social aspect. Once you're connected, you can watch shows together on Facebook Watch or play augmented reality games. Facebook is also showing sensitivity to privacy concerns, giving users an easy way to cover the camera and turn off the microphones when not using the device.\n\nWhile tech mega-cap peers Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft have experienced varying degrees of success with consumer devices, Facebook has failed to find much of a customer base. Last year, the company released the Portal and Portal+ video chat smart speakers powered by Amazon Alexa, but sales were minimal. Facebook said in July that second-quarter revenue in the payments and other fees segment, which includes Oculus virtual reality headsets and Portal devices, rose 36% to $262 million, accounting for less than 2% of total sales.", "description": "Facebook unveils the Portal TV, a streaming device that comes with a camera and microphones for making video calls via television.", "authors": ["Salvador Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106135092-1568773827397portaltv3.jpg?v=1568773932", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
