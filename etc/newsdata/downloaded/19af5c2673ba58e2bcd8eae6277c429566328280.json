I have all the say; I have power over everything I do,\" she told the Daily Mail in 2009.\n\n\"I have never been insecure, ever, about how I look, about what I want to do with myself. My mum told me to only ever do things for myself, not for others.\"\n\nAnd when Chanel's creative director Karl Lagerfeld branded her a \"little too fat\" in 2012, Adele hit back, insisting she was \"very proud\" of her looks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d lose weight if I was an actress and had to play a role where you\u2019re supposed to be 40lb lighter, but weight has nothing to do with my career,\" the no-nonsense star told People magazine.\n\nShe even blacklisted those who tried to suggest as much, revealing, \u201cEven when I was signing a \u00adcontract, most of the industry knew if anyone ever dared say, \u2018Lose weight\u2019 to me, they wouldn\u2019t be working with me.\u201d\n\nBut after a health scare in 2011, she began making lifestyle changes to protect her voice - and her weight began to fall.\n\nShe ditched her 10 daily cups of sugary tea and waved goodbye to alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine all \"spicy, citrusy, and tangy\" foods.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"It's f***ing boring, but I don't think you take your voice seriously until you've an accident,\" she told Australia's 60 Minutes of her 2011 vocal hemorrhage.\n\n\"I'm frightened all the time I'm going to damage my voice,\" she admitted.\n\nIn 2016 she shed yet more weight ahead of her tour in a bid to \"get some stamina\".\n\n\"Now I fit into normal, off-the-shelf clothes, which is a really big problem for me,\" she proudly told Vogue.\n\nBy 2017 she was believed to have lost more than two stone, reportedly due to The Sirtfood Diet, which sees slimmers fill up on plant-based foods like kale, buckwheat, green tea and tumeric.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe foods are known as sirtuin activators, and are said to control the way the body processes fat and sugar and regulate the appetite in the process.\n\nGreen tea and cocoa powder are also on the menu, along with red wine and cheese.\n\n\"The Sirtfood Diet is all about losing weight and feeling fantastic through eating great-tasting food,\" a source told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"It's based on extensive research into the power of key plant foods, which when added to our diet turn on fat burning and improve wellbeing.\"\n\n(Image: Adele/Twitter)\n\nNow believed to be dating Grime artist Skepta, 37, the slender mother-of-one is believed to have turned to reformer pilates to transform her body yet again in the space of just six months.\n\nAccording to The Sun, she's been taking classes alongside good friend Ayda Field - who's married to Robbie Williams - and has seen some dramatic results, losing more than a stone.\n\n\"She has been loving her new workout regime and it really works for her,\" a source told newspaper.\n\n\"It\u2019s a bonus that she has shifted some weight. Her mates are glad she\u2019s letting loose and there\u2019s nothing but good feelings towards her. She\u2019s got a new lease of life.\"\n\nBut despite Adele's dedication, she has refreshingly admitted that she will never, ever, relish going to the gym.\n\n\u201cI mainly moan. I\u2019m not, like, skipping to the f-cking gym. I don\u2019t enjoy it,\" she told Rolling Stone in 2016.\n\n(Image: Sourced from Instagram)\n\n(Image: Twitter/Elizabeth Lauren)\n\n\"I do like doing weights. I don\u2019t like looking in the mirror. Blood vessels burst on my face really easily, so I\u2019m so conscious when I\u2019m lifting weights not to let them burst in my face. And if I don\u2019t tour, you\u2019ll catch me back down at the Chinese!\u201d\n\nAnd as for claims that her best mate Jennifer Lawrence has inspired her \"Hollywood makeover\", a source previously told The Sun: \u201cPeople change, and Adele is very happy with where her life is going. She has new friends and new inspirations and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\n\u201cIf people have a problem with her dressing well and looking after her health, I really don\u2019t know what to say to them.\u201d", "description": "Inspirational Adele made it clear from the start that she would be no-one's 'product', thank you very much", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Hulton Archive", "Getty", "Adele Twitter", "Sourced Instagram", "Twitter Elizabeth Lauren"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20058236.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Adele.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
