But a month later, Congress is right back at it again.\n\nMore veterans and military members are putting VA loans into service to buy homes\n\nNow they want to extend those higher loan fees for an additional five years to pay for housing grant and education benefits for qualified veterans. This new bill, HR 3504, passed the House in late July but has yet to be taken up by the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee.\n\nWhether it\u2019s expanding disability benefits or scholarship programs, veterans and their families have earned these benefits. We should push our elected officials to boost funding for important measures like HR 3504 at every turn. But Congress can\u2019t continue to reduce one veteran\u2019s benefit to pay for another.\n\nExtending these fees would force VA borrowers to pay more than $750 million to use their home loan benefit over the next seven years, with most of that money going to programs that have nothing to do with housing. The Congressional Budget Office projects the two bills will produce a combined $160 million government windfall.\n\nThey\u2019re also going to make it more difficult and even riskier for some veterans to get a VA loan.\n\nMost veterans and service members finance the funding fee, which applies to all VA loans unless the borrower receives compensation for a service-connected disability. These $0 down mortgages have been the safest loan on the market for nearly all of the past decade, but having to finance higher fees pushes homeowners underwater on their mortgages for longer, making it difficult if not impossible for them to sell in some cases.\n\nOwing more than your home is worth can be especially devastating for active duty military, who relocate frequently given the nature of their service.\n\nVA owes disabled veterans refunds on home loan fees, report says\n\nInstead of hiding behind pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases or cuts to offset new spending, lawmakers could stand up for veterans and military families and exempt their benefits entirely.\n\nCongress waived the budget rule to bail out big banks, make infrastructure investments, enact tax cuts and more. They can and should create a permanent pay-as-you-go exemption to protect veterans\u2019 benefits. It\u2019s time to stop this zero-sum approach to caring for those who serve our country and their families.\n\nThe men and women of our Armed Forces sacrifice so much to safeguard our freedoms. They\u2019re trained to make tough choices every single day, often with lives hanging in the balance.\n\nAs a country, we\u2019ve made a promise to veterans and military families. We shouldn\u2019t be falling short because of budgetary rules and procedures. We shouldn\u2019t be hiking home loan fees or raising TRICARE pharmacy co-pays to cover another veteran\u2019s benefit.\n\nCongress must fully live up to that promise and start making tough choices about funding and priorities without sacrificing or eroding veterans\u2019 benefits.\n\nOur job is to make sure they know we\u2019re watching.\n\nChris Birk is author of \u201cThe Book on VA Loans: An Essential Guide to Maximizing Your Home Loan Benefits\u201d and director of education for Veterans United Home Loans, the country\u2019s largest VA lender.", "description": "These $0 down mortgages have been the safest loan on the market for nearly all of the last decade, but having to finance higher fees pushes homeowners underwater on their mortgages for longer, making it difficult if not impossible for them to sell in some cases.", "authors": ["Chris Birk"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HQWWPSRWHEI6TA3V4POPNNUFLA.jpg"}
