Goals. https://t.co/Rl2PjqrQuC \u2014 Amanda Macias (@amanda_m_macias) October 9, 2019\n\nHer colleague, CNBC national security reporter Amanda Macias, then tweeted the video, writing, \u201cProof that @ckubeNBC is the hardest working mom in the Pentagon press corps and all the while consistently breaks news. Goals.\u201d\n\nAs the adorable viral moment was unfolding, however, the two women were being dragged into a major scandal.\n\nOn Wednesday, US authorities arrested a counter-terrorism analyst at the US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) and charged him with leaking to the two journalists in 2018 and 2019.\n\nHenry Kyle Frese, 30, of Alexandria, Virginia, was taken into custody when he arrived at work and faces two counts of revealing classified defence information to persons not entitled to receive it.\n\nThe Justice Department did not reveal the content of the information allegedly leaked by Mr Frese other than to say it concerned a \u201cforeign country\u2019s weapons systems\u201d.\n\n\u201cFrese was caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security information for personal gain,\u201d Assistant Attorney-General for National Security John C. Demers said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFrese betrayed the trust placed in him by the American people \u2014 a betrayal that risked harming the national security of this country. This is one of six unauthorised disclosure cases the department has charged in just over two years, and we will continue in our efforts to punish and deter this behaviour.\u201d\n\nMr Frese was a contractor with the DIA from January 2017 to February 2018 and a full-fledged DIA employee since then with clearance ranging up to the top-secret level, officials said. The DIA is the US military\u2019s intelligence service.\n\nGreat. via @CNN US Officials say \"a new leaker is exposing national security documents.\" #OPSEC #NationalSecurity \u2014 Kyle Frese (@HKFrese) August 5, 2014\n\nOne of the reporters to whom DIA official @HKFrese allegedly leaked top secret intel posted a picture of the two drinking and partying together at the German embassy in 2017. Per the federal affidavit, the two were romantically involved and lived together for a year. #OPSEC pic.twitter.com/niodUwPLsU \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 9, 2019\n\nThis seems to be one of the tweets referenced in the indictment of DIA analyst Henry Kyle Frese. pic.twitter.com/yPaur8Wdm4 \u2014 Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) October 9, 2019\n\nIn April or May of last year, Mr Frese allegedly accessed an intelligence report \u201cunrelated to his job duties on multiple occasions\u201d and passed on information to one of the journalists, according to the indictment.\n\nWhile not named in the indictment, Macias and Kube are identifiable as the two journalists who received the information, with public tweets cited in the court filings corresponding to tweets sent by the pair.\n\nMacias and Frese had the same residential address from August 2017 until August 2018, the DOJ said, and \u201cbased on reviews of Frese\u2019s and Journalist 1\u2019s public social media pages, it appears that they were involved in a romantic relationship for some or all of that period of time\u201d.\n\nIn May 2018, Macias wrote a story for CNBC citing \u201csources with direct knowledge of US intelligence reports\u201d that China had installed anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems on the contested Spratly Islands.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Macias wrote to Mr Frese in April last year to ask whether he would be willing to speak to Kube. Frese stated that he was \u201cdown\u201d to help Kube if it helped Macias because he wanted to see Macias \u201cprogress\u201d.\n\nIn July, she tweeted, \u201cNBC\u2019s @ckubeNBC and I break in our first shared byline. Beijing is in the midst of conducting a series of anti-ship missile tests in the South China Sea. These contested waters serve as a gateway to global sea routes where approximately $US3.4 trillion in trade pass annually.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, Mr Frese\u2019s mobile phone was being monitored and he was heard last month transmitting classified information to Kube.\n\nMr Frese goes by the name \u201cKyle Frese\u201d on Twitter, where he often retweeted Macias\u2019 stories and previously mocked US President Donald Trump for not understanding \u201cOPSEC\u201d, or operations security.\n\nJust last month he appeared to attack NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, writing, \u201cI suppose you of all people, would be a good judge of what information is too dangerous to be released?\u201d\n\nMr Frese could face up to 10 years in prison for each count of transmitting classified information if convicted.\n\nLast year, Senate Intelligence Committee staffer James Wolfe was arrested and charged with lying to investigators about his contacts with three reporters, one of whom he was allegedly in a romantic relationship with.\n\nNew York Times reporter Ali Watkins had previously tweeted about wanting to be like the character Zoe Barnes, from political drama House of Cards, who sleeps with Kevin Spacey\u2019s character to get stories.\n\n\u2014 with AFP", "description": "A TV anchor has been interrupted by her young son while delivering a live broadcast in a cute \u201cmum moment\u201d that went quickly viral.", "authors": ["Frank Chung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4588cadd4ac5daae49e20f9a5fd6f35c?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
