He is director of the Center for Microbial Pathogenesis at Georgia State University.\n\n\"They were completely protected. None of them showed any sign of disease to the parental virus,\" Basler said in a university news release.\n\nImmune response to similar diseases\n\n\"The big take-home message is that we can make an Ebola virus that grows, but if we disable this function, we can now make a virus that is very highly attenuated in the animals,\" he explained.\n\nThe goal of the research is to see if this approach can be used in a drug that can knock out the VP35 protein in Ebola and protect people, researchers said, although research on animals may not produce the same results in humans.\n\nAlso, targeting this protein might be useful in producing an immune response to similar diseases like the Marburg virus, Basler said.\n\nThe report was published in the journal Cell Reports.\n\nEbola is a deadly virus that causes outbreaks of severe disease in humans. From 2013 to 2016, an epidemic that began in West Africa affected more than 28 000 people, killing more than 11 000. An outbreak that began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018 has already killed nearly 1 800 people, the researchers added.\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "A mutated form of the Ebola virus was safe for researchers to work with.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9007/3c701f5d4690491894d93df22e7620fe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
