Even if I was going to reoffend they couldn't stop me'.\n\nRichard Huckle has been stabbed to death in his cell with a makeshift 'shiv' knife. Paul Fitzgerald, a convicted sex offender himself, has been put in isolation as Humberside Police prepares to launch a murder investigation.\n\nHuckle worked as an English teacher, infiltrating impoverished communities, targeting care homes and orphanages\n\nThe details on how Huckle was killed were reported by the BBC's Danny Shaw.\n\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'HMP Full Sutton prisoner Richard Huckle died on October 13.\n\n'It would be inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is ongoing.'\n\nA friend of one of his victims had screamed: 'A thousand deaths is too good for you' as he was taken down from the Old Bailey dock after his five-week trial three years ago.\n\n\n\nMasquerading as a devout Christian, Huckle spent years targeting care homes and orphanages while teaching English and photography in Malaysia and Cambodia.\n\nThe so called 'Gap Year' paedophile bragged about the abuse in a twisted blog in which he awarded himself 'PedoPoints' for the ferocity of his sexual assaults.\n\nHe even filmed himself raping children and babies. From the age of 19 he amassed a staggering 20,000 images of child abuse that he sold for profit.\n\nHuckle, 33, was ordered to serve at least 25 years behind bars for 191 sexual offences against children as young as six months after a trial at the Old Bailey in 2016\n\nInvestigators believe he would have attacked hundreds more children had he not been caught in 2014 when Australian police uncovered a network of paedophiles on the 'dark' web.\n\nHuckle, who was given 22 life sentences, boasted about kissing a girl in a diary\n\nHe was arrested by the National Crime Agency after flying home to visit his family for Christmas in 2015.\n\nHuckle maintained his innocence to police but later confessed to his parents. Horrified, they begged police to take him away.\n\nIn the worst case of its kind at the Old Bailey he admitted an unprecedented 71 charges over eight years, including rape, sexual assault and sexual activity with a child.\n\nAs he was taken from the dock an onlooker shouted from the public gallery: 'A thousand deaths is too good for you. I know one of those families. They mean nothing to you.'\n\nJudge Peter Rook QC said Huckle posed a substantial risk for an indefinite period: 'This was a prolonged campaign of rape of the children from a small community.\n\n'You targeted and groomed impoverished children and their families in a poor community, no doubt seeking to impress them with your relative wealth as a Westerner.\n\nAs he was taken from the dock in 2016, an onlooker shouted from the public gallery: 'A thousand deaths is too good for you. I know one of those families. They mean nothing to you'\n\n'That community was particularly vulnerable because of its poverty. Your offending became entrenched in everyday life, your life revolved around abusing children.\n\nHuckle passed a short letter through the glass dock before sentencing, in which he claimed he was disgusted with his behaviour\n\n'Your distorted beliefs are deep-seated, your self-delusion knows no bounds. You were and are sexually obsessed with children.\n\n'It is clear from your postings on hidden encrypted paedophile websites on the dark web, and from the manual you were in the process of drafting, that your life revolved around your obsession with your own sexual gratification by child sex abuse. It is also clear that, had you not been arrested, you planned to continue the same lifestyle.'\n\nHuckle, who used churches he attended in Kent as a 'stepping stone' to gain access to victims abroad, sat with his hands clasped together as if in prayer as he was sentenced.\n\nThe judge said a 60-page child abuse manual he penned instructing others on how to target victims was a 'truly evil document'.\n\nHuckle passed a short letter through the glass dock before sentencing, in which he claimed he was disgusted with his behaviour.\n\nBut the judge said he showed no remorse or understanding of the public abhorrence over his campaign of rape.\n\nHuckle's -body was found in his top floor cell at HMP Full Sutton, a Category A jail near York\n\nHe added: 'In my view, you may well harbour feelings of regret but there is no feeling of genuine remorse in this case.'\n\nHuckle was prosecuted over the abuse of 23 children, but officers uncovered more than 20,000 indecent images and videos\n\nInvestigators have been unable to identify Huckle's victims as he has refused to hand over encrypted passwords to hidden files on his computer.\n\nHe was prosecuted over the abuse of 23 children, but officers managed to uncover more than 20,000 indecent images and videos.\n\nAnthony Hill, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'It is hard to put into words the sheer depravity. For almost nine years, Richard Huckle subjected at least 23 children, some of them very young, to the most horrifying abuse imaginable.\n\n'He deliberately targeted and groomed vulnerable communities to gain their trust. He took photographs of the abuse to upload on the dark web to share worldwide.'\n\nAn NSPCC spokesman said: 'Huckle is a frighteningly depraved paedophile who bragged about raping babies and delighted in abusing infants who trusted him.\n\n'He left a trail of devastation and his sentence reflects the severity of his crimes. It is horrifying that Huckle was able to profit from this appalling abuse.'\n\nA spokesman for Humberside Police said today: 'An investigation has been launched following an incident at HMP Full Sutton on Sunday October 13.\n\n'We were called shortly after 12.30pm reporting that a man had died at the prison.\n\n'Humberside Police are working closely with the Prison Service to investigate the death of an inmate and at this time we are treating the death as suspicious.'", "description": "Huckle, who abused 200 children, was knifed to death in his cell at HMP Full Sutton with a makeshift 'shiv' reportedly fashioned from a toothbrush.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle", "Martin Robinson Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/15/19791916-0-image-a-9_1571236222761.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
