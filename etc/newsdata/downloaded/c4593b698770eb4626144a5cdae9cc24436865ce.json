The SNP and the Lib Dems are both tempted to go for an election as soon as a three-month delay is agreed.\n\nThe Labour Party's official position has always been that they would agree to an election. In fact, officially, they are chomping at the bit, like the other parties, as long as a delay is agreed.\n\nOne senior member of the shadow cabinet predicted they would not be able to withstand the pressure if the Lib Dems and the SNP said yes.\n\nJeremy Corbyn himself, and certainly one group in his camp, are understood to be very tempted, too. But, just as in 2017, lots of Labour MPs are horrified at the idea, partly because of Labour's standing in the polls.\n\nBut also, there are senior shadow cabinet ministers who believe the smart thing would be to leave the PM in his purgatory, twisting, unable to get his bill through, unable to get to an election.\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhere parties stand on election", "description": "Ambassadors will discuss what length of delay to offer as MPs consider the PM's early election call.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5998/production/_109363922_mediaitem109363920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
