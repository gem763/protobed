That is what India did and a new report from Harvard University has analysed the effects.\n\nThree years ago Indian prime minister Narendra Modi turned the country overnight into a cashless society, announcing 86% of banknotes in circulation would no longer be legal tender\n\nIn early summer this year an eyebrow-raising report from UK Finance predicted by 2028 that just 9 per cent of payments in the UK would be made in cash.\n\nWhile this has led to calls for free access to cash to be maintained, we know less about what might happen if Britain did go cashless.\n\nOr do we? Because one of the world's largest economies did, albeit temporarily, do exactly that.\n\nIn November 2016, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi announced a policy that made 86 per cent of the cash in circulation in the country illegal tender overnight.\n\nIndia's demonetisation got rid of all 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes in a bid to curtail what the prime minister called the 'shadow economy'.\n\nWhile 500 and 1,000 rupee notes were declared illegal overnight, it took until the following summer for them to be fully replaced with new notes. The demonetisation caused chaos\n\nPredictably, it caused chaos, as while Indians were quick to return the old banknotes, replacement ones came more slowly.\n\nEven when they were available the replacement was uneven across the country, meaning that for eight months many Indians were left without access to cash.\n\nNow, a new report from Harvard University's Quarterly Journal of Economics has looked into the results of the Indian government's demonetisation, with some eye-opening findings.\n\nBundles of 1,000 rupee notes after they were deposited at a bank in Bangalore, India in November 2016 after the notes were declared illegal tender by prime minister Narendra Modi\n\nThe economists who worked on the report used the combination of a household employment survey and satellite images of lights at night as a way to measure economic activity in the immediate aftermath of the decision.\n\nIn countries where GDP stats aren't always the most accurate, how much light is generated at night by things like factories, offices and restaurants can be used as a measure of economic growth.\n\nThe report noted that while Indians were starved of banknotes and the ability to physically access cash, the amount of cash in the system remained the same as did interest rates.\n\n'We therefore conclude that in modern India, cash plays a special role in facilitating transactions', it said.\n\nThe report found four main trends over the period in which Indians were starved of the ability to use cash.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, ATM withdrawals fell while overall deposits grew.\n\nIn turn, with people unable to access cash, they turned to alternative ways of paying like digital or mobile wallets or cards.\n\nData from Worldpay and Statista crunched by Expert Market and published by This is Money in April this year found that India was one of the heaviest users of digital wallet payments, but it still accounted for just six per cent of transactions in 2017.\n\nA currency notes exchanger puts up a sign of not accepting 500 and 1000 Indian rupee currency notes at a roadside stall in Amritsar, India on 9 November 2016\n\nHowever, after demonetisation took place, it's clear people were forced to find alternatives.\n\nThe report said: 'Payments using both eWallet and point of sale payments increased more in districts experiencing sharper declines in money following demonetization. Thus, although these areas experienced declines in ATM usage, they had faster growth of alternative payment mechanisms.'\n\nThis is one area where a UK comparison could be made. The UK had the fourth-highest eWallet usage in 2017, while UK Finance found one in six UK adults used mobile payments last year at least once. It's possible that if cash disappeared completely eWallet payments would be the main beneficiary.\n\nA new report from Harvard University economists found that in response to India becoming a temporary cashless society, mobile payments boomed and ATM withdrawals fell\n\nBut the most surprising finding was what happened to the overall economy. The report concluded 'that the cash shortage caused by demonetisation generated a decline in national economic activity of roughly three percentage points or more in November and December 2016', compared to if demonetisation hadn't happened.\n\nThat, it said, was enough to cause a 2 per cent decline in economic growth in the final three months of 2016, which would cause the Indian economy to slip from a growth rate of 1.5 per cent in the previous quarter to a 0.5 per cent decline. All because of the disappearance of cash.\n\nBut what lessons could this report, which focuses on an economy very different to the UK's, have for this country?\n\nFirstly, a sudden shift away from the use of cash could cause 'substantial economic disruption'.\n\nGabriel Chodorow-Reich, one of the Harvard economists who produced the report, told NPR 'you don't want to do it suddenly', if you did get rid of cash.\n\nMoreover, it's likely that sole traders and small businesses would be particularly hard hit by the disappearance of cash, even if the UK doesn't have an underground economy like India.\n\nHowever, over the longer term it's more difficult to make predictions on what could happen. The system had returned to normal by June 2017 as new banknotes finally replaced the old ones.\n\nThe report acknowledged: 'There may be advantages from demonetisation that arise from improvements in tax collections and in a shift to non-cash payment mechanisms', but that it needed more long-term data to be sure.\n\nBut for now, this is probably the clearest picture we have on what a cashless society may look like, and it wasn't particularly pretty.", "description": "In November 2016, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi announced a policy that made 86 per cent of the cash in circulation in the country illegal tender overnight.
