But the super-rich, on the other hand, can splurge out on private jets instead. They're a true symbol of luxury, designed to satisfy the demanding whims of multi-millionaires \u2014 but first, you have to find someone to make it take off.\n\nBut this is now proving to be increasingly complicated, according to The Independent, which reports that fewer and fewer pilots are now willing to fly private jets. The private aviation sector is reportedly heading towards a shortage of pilots \u2014 because they prefer working for commercial airlines over private parties.\n\nRead more: The era of the private jet is very much alive in the world of millionaire dating, where flying to Paris for a night is a rom-com reality\n\nWhy? Commercial pilots benefit from a higher salary, as well as significantly more stable working conditions. Private pilots, on the other hand, must make themselves readily available at all times, depending on when the jet owner wants to travel \u2014 sometimes spontaneously.\n\nThey can then travel for indefinite periods of time \u2014 up to several weeks at a stretch \u2014 a constraint that can leave little room for family and social life. This instability also extends to wages, with private jet pilots at a higher risk of losing their jobs if their employer decides to sell their aircraft.\n\nThe industry will suffer tremendously if more than 5,000 new private pilots are not found every year over the next 20 years, according to The Independent. And that objective seems difficult to achieve.\n\nOliver Stone, managing director of the private jet reseller Company Colibri, told newspaper: \"The world needs some 98,000 new business aviation pilots between now and 2038 to meet growing demand. However, the business aviation sector is struggling to compete with airlines in recruiting pilots.\"\n\nHe added that this problem is also having a growing impact on the sale of private jets.\n\nRead more: Take a tour of the private jet that a billionaire chief executive flies around the world\n\nMeanwhile, commercial airlines continue to attract new pilots, particularly with the rise of low-cost airlines. In a few years' time, some mega-rich people may well find themselves forced to abandon their private jets for the first class cabins of commercial aircraft.\n\nThis is arguably good news for pilots, who may benefit from better working conditions \u2014 and it's also good news for the environment, which could be saved a few thousand tonnes of CO2.", "description": "More and more pilots now prefer working for commercial and budget airlines \u2014 and it's creating headaches for the owners of private jets.", "authors": ["Sophia Ankel", "Albane Guichard", "Business Insider France"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da71aa5cc4a0a2e8b14fd46?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
