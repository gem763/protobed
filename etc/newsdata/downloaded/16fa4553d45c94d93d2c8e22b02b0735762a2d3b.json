The victims' conditions are unknown.\n\nThe shooting occurred at New England Pentecostal church in Pelham, a city of 13,000 in southeast New Hampshire near the Massachusetts border.\n\n\u201cFrom my understanding, they basically gang-tackled them,\" Roark said.\n\nIn this photo provided by WMUR-TV, police stand outside the New England Pentecostal Church on Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019, in Pelham, N.H.

Police estimated that about 40 people were in attendance.\n\n\u201cThis does not seem to be a random event,\u201d Roark said.\n\nPolice did not release any information about the wedding parties or their relationship to the gunman.\n\nRoark said he did not know if any of the guests were armed, but that police had provided active shooter training to the church within the past year.\n\nLowell resident Darius Mitchell told USA TODAY that his friend of 30 years, Bishop Stanley Choate, was one of the two people shot. According to Mitchell, Choate was taken to Lowell General, where his niece was working, and then flown to Boston.\n\nMany people took to social media to call for prayers for the bishop's speedy recovery.\n\nChoate presides over New England Pentecostal Ministries and serves as Chair Person of the New England Coalition for Racial Harmony, according to the church\u2019s website.
