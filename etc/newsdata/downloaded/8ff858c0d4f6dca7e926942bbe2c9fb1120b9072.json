But he had also said earlier in the week that nobody in his family will have an office in the White House or have foreign business relationships if he becomes president.\n\nThe issue is also at the center of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Congress is probing a July phone call where the U.S. president pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on the Bidens.\n\nMr. Kent, a Ukraine and Russia expert, was testifying to congressional investigators as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
