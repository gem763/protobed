I threw my hat in the ring and I believe that I was the right person to help shape the future of the sport.\n\n\u201cWe had the integrity unit up and running within two years and it was one of the centrepieces of the reforms. But I\u2019m not naive enough to think that just having those structures in place is enough. You need people to buy in culturally to those challenges and it\u2019s always ongoing.\n\n\u201cIn four years\u2019 time I would like to be talking about the progress we hope to make about sponsorships, formats, a consolidated calendar and getting more money into the pockets of athletes.\u201d\n\nRussia\n\nThe Russian Athletics Federation has been banned by the IAAF since 2015 after revelations of massive, widespread doping.\n\nThe question of its possible readmittance will be discussed again by the IAAF Council on Monday but, with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) still ploughing through the monumental pile of athlete sample data finally provided by the Russians and routinely producing historic positive tests, a return still seems some way in the distance.\n\nMore than 70 Russian athletes were cleared to qualify for the world championships in Doha, but those there will compete as neutrals unless the IAAF Council goes against the odds and votes to reinstate the federation next week.\n\nCoe: \u201cLet\u2019s start with the glass half-full - they are moving in the right direction. Yes, you have the issue with banned coaches still operating and it\u2019s quite hard sometimes to control that in a landmass that big, but we do have to be tough about it as part of the criteria (for a return).\n\n\u201cThe biggest piece of the jigsaw still to go through the system though is the analysis of the data. The volume is enormous - I\u2019m told that it is a mountainous exercise. A lot of the information isn\u2019t clear-cut but that Russia provided it is a big tick and we have recouped the legal fees. But the question of reinstatement will be on the advice from the task force.\n\n\u201cI want the criteria to be met and I want them back in as a reinstated federation, but only on the basis that there is no imperilling of clean athletes.\u201d\n\nCaster Semenya and athletes with Differences in Sexual Development (DSD)\n\nSemenya and other DSD athletes with XY chromosomes have been banned from running races from 400m to a mile unless they take testosterone suppressant medication and so she will not be defending her 800 metres title in Doha.\n\nThe issue has had enormous publicity and sparked a wider debate about sport and gender in which the IAAF\u2019s stance has frequently come under attack.\n\nCoe: \u201cI know the argument is far from binary but my responsibility is to do everything I can to make sure that there is a level playing field and that includes trying to find a navigable route to keep athletes with that condition in our sport and not splintering into different classifications or actually not being given the opportunity to compete at all.\n\n\u201cSome people are choosing to not properly understand what the science and the challenge behind the issue is. If some of the arguments I\u2019m hearing were carried through, our sport would be ripped asunder so I\u2019m not going to bow a knee to any of these groups. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019ve got a tin ear to societal change - I have my own daughters and I\u2019m probably more socially aware than most of those groups that are occasionally giving us lectures.\n\n\u201cWe have also had considerable support but showing this support publicly comes at a cost. Those who stick their heads above the parapet are vilified and trolled online so I understand that many are wary of showing it in public forums, but we hear directly from them regularly. It is a minefield to even talk about this.\u201d\n\nChristian Coleman case\n\nThe American sprinter, the fastest man in the world this year, missed three doping tests within 12 months.\n\nHe escaped what should have been an automatic ban via a \u201cwhereabouts rule\u201d technicality that ruled one of the missed tests had to be backdated to outside the window and he will now race in Doha. Coe accepted that it was \u201cnot a good look\u201d for the sport.\n\nCoe: \u201cWe have to be very protective of the reputation of the athletes and I\u2019m pleased that it\u2019s shown that the rules needed revising. But I\u2019m not going to turn my guns on WADA or the United States Anti-Doping Agency (which was forced to drop its case). I think both those organisations are doing a really good job.\u201d\n\nThe Diamond League\n\nCoe has long recognised that for many fans the Diamond League is a confusing, disjointed series of events with \u201cno clear narrative\u201d that is hard to follow on TV.\n\nThe IAAF recently announced a series of changes for next season, including the introduction of one \u201cgrand final\u201d \u2014 instead of the current two in different cities a week apart \u2014 and is expected soon to announce a new title sponsor.\n\nCoe: \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing the same thing from potential sponsors and fans and that\u2019s that they don\u2019t really understand the format - some weeks we have two or three meets then go a week without one. It\u2019s not straightforward to change that as each meet is its own event. So we\u2019re not going to have every Diamond League on a Friday night for example, but ideally we\u2019ll get them from Thursday through to Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe also need to address the whole look of it. I absolutely understand when people are bemused when they see 12 of the 19 athletes running the 1500m at Zurich wearing identical vests. That kit issue is still firmly in my in-tray and we have started discussion with the kit manufacturers.\n\n\u201cWe need to try to find the solution but that has to recognise the commercial imperative of the apparel and shoe manufacturers who are key pillars of supporting the sport\u2019s ecosystem.\u201d", "description": "Sebastian Coe will be re-elected unopposed as IAAF President on Wednesday and has talked to Reuters in an extensive interview about the challenges and achievements of his tenure and what is in his \"in-tray\" for the next four years.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432026845&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1KD-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
