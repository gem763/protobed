The company\u2019s shares fell 6.8% Friday.\n\nChip maker Xilinx Inc. is looking for a new finance chief to help lead its expansion into new markets and boost revenue for its data-center and automotive businesses, the company said.\n\nThe San Jose, Calif.-based company Thursday said Lorenzo Flores plans to leave after the company reports fiscal second-quarter results Oct. 23. He will join a rival, Toshiba Memory Holdings Corp., as vice chairman in November, the Japanese chip maker said.\n\nXilinx has begun a formal search for a CFO. \u201cThis person should be able to make strategic recommendations to the CEO and provide value beyond the accounting skill set,\u201d a company spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe new CFO also would lead mergers and acquisitions and expand the company\u2019s operations in the U.S., China and India, the spokeswoman said. Xilinx shares fell 6.8% to $96.55 Friday on the Nasdaq. The company announced the news after regular trading hours Thursday. Mr. Flores worked at Xilinx for 11 years, the past three years as CFO. Sumeet Gagneja, the company\u2019s chief accounting officer, and Matt Poirier, an executive who is taking on the treasurer role at Xilinx, will handle finance operations while the company looks for a new finance chief, Xilinx said. The CFO\u2019s departure could signal some headwinds for the company in the next one or two quarters, said Kinngai Chan, senior research analyst at Summit Insights Group LLC. He added that management\u2019s outlook for fiscal 2020 is too aggressive given the global economic climate. A Bank of America analyst report said the departure was surprising given Xilinx made the announcement 11 days before the quarter\u2019s end. Xilinx attributes the timing to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that companies report major events within four business days of the occurrence. Mr. Flores submitted his resignation Sept. 17, the company spokeswoman said. The Bank of America report also said rising competition in the 5G market presents a challenge for the company. The investment bank on Friday cut Xilinx to neutral and lowered its price target on the stock to $115 from $150. Toshiba Memory, which will be rebranded as Kioxia Holdings Corp. on Oct. 1, spun off from parent Toshiba Corp. last year. The company is preparing for an initial public offering. \u2014Micah Maidenberg and Patrick Sheridan contributed to this article Write to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
