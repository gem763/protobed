McMillon in the letter described himself as a gun owner and said that company founder Sam Walton was \u201can avid outdoorsman who had a passion for quail hunting.\u201d\n\nWalmart will stop selling handgun sales in Alaska, the only state where it still sells hand guns. The halt on the ammunition and handgun sales will come into effect when current inventory is sold out.\n\nKroger had sold guns in 43 of its Fred Meyer stores in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska before announcing in March 2018 that it would exit the firearms business.\n\nPRAISE AND CRITICISM\n\nThe retailers\u2019 latest moves sparked immediate reaction from groups on both sides of the gun control debate.\n\n\u201cThe tide is turning,\u201d said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. The announcements \u201csend a strong cultural signal that when lawmakers don\u2019t protect their constituents, companies will protect their customers.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018. REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA), a pro-gun group with deep political ties, said Walmart was succumbing to pressure from \u201canti-gun elites.\u201d\n\n\u201cLines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America\u2019s fundamental freedoms,\u201d it said. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Kroger move.\n\nWalmart said its latest actions would reduce its share of the ammunition market from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%, and would trend toward the lower end of that range over time.\n\nU.S. gun and ammunition stores had total sales of about $11 billion last year, of which 19% was ammunition, according to market research firm IBISWorld.\n\nThe move reflects growing corporate activism on guns.\n\nWalmart, like rival Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, had previously ended sales of assault rifles and raised the minimum age for gun purchases to 21.\n\nBank of America last year said it would no longer lend to companies making military-style firearms for civilians, and airlines Delta and United last year said they were no longer offering discounted rates to the NRA.\n\nThe latest move will leave Walmart focused on weapons for hunting, including deer rifles, shotguns and related ammunition.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cThe general principle is if we don\u2019t sell the firearm we wouldn\u2019t sell the ammunition,\u201d a spokesman for Walmart told Reuters.\n\nJust last month, Walmart said it would not change its policy on selling firearms even as it took down signs and playable demos of violent video games.\n\nOn Friday, McMillon in his letter to employees said he would send letters urging action on \u201ccommon sense measures\u201d to the White House and the Congressional leadership, calling for debate of the reauthorization of a ban on assault weapons, to determine its effectiveness, as well.", "description": "Walmart Inc, the nation's largest retailer, said on Tuesday it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in all its stores across the United States, and called for action on gun safety after a string of mass shootings, including at Walmart stores in Texas and Mississippi.", "authors": ["Nivedita Balu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425846271&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821LE"}
