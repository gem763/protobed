Absolutely. No question about that,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\n\u2018From bad to worse\u2019\n\nHours later, Mulvaney abruptly recanted.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, his initial admission appeared to support Democrats\u2019 charges that Trump abused his power and violated election laws.\n\n\u201cMulvaney just said that US military aid for Ukraine was held up pending Ukraine\u2019s investigation of Democrats,\u201d tweeted Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman who is leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThings just went from very, very bad to much, much worse,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Mulvaney argued that Trump had done nothing wrong because he acted in support of a Justice Department probe into the origins of 2016 Russian meddling allegations.\n\nAnd Mulvaney denied that Trump also tied the aid to Ukraine investigating a top Democratic rival, Joe Biden, ahead of the 2020 vote.\n\nThat Biden allegation is the other key leg of Democrats\u2019 charges against Trump.\n\n\u201cThe money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden,\u201d he said.\n\nDramatic revelations\n\nMulvaney\u2019s comments added to a dramatic day in which a senior diplomat told Congressional investigators that Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani sought political help from Ukraine. Trump also announced that US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was deeply involved in Ukraine talks, was stepping down.\n\nWord of Perry\u2019s departure came a day after the publication of an interview in which Perry said that \u2014 on Trump\u2019s orders \u2014 he had communicated with Giuliani over alleged corruption in Ukraine.\n\nTrump said Perry had told him of his plans to resign months ago.\n\nGordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, said in written testimony that Trump ordered diplomats in May to involve Giuliani in talks with new Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nGiuliani, he said, sought to pressure Zelensky to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son over ties to a Ukraine energy company, Burisma, as well as to find evidence for the 2016 Democratic server theory. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma for five years until April this year.\n\n\u201cMr Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election (including the DNC server) and Burisma as two anti-corruption investigatory topics of importance for the president,\u201d Sondland said.\n\n\u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nEvidence Trump abused powers\n\nSondland, a businessman who was appointed ambassador after donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration festivities, sought to distance himself from the political storm enveloping the White House.\n\nSondland said Giuliani was the principal messenger, and that he had few communications with the president\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cMy understanding was that the president directed Mr. Giuliani\u2019s participation, that Mr. Giuliani was expressing the concerns of the president,\u201d Sondland stated.\n\n\u201cOur view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of US foreign policy towards Ukraine.\u201d\n\nEight witnesses\n\nSondland was the eighth witness to testify to the three House committees leading the impeachment investigation, all defying White House efforts to block them from appearing.\n\nDemocrats appear increasingly likely to unveil articles of impeachment \u2014 formal charges \u2014 before the end of the year.\n\nIf approved by the Democrat-dominated House of Representatives, Trump would then go on trial for removal in the Senate, where Republicans have the majority.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi denied Thursday that the investigation was politically driven, and said there was no timeline.\n\n\u201cNone of us came to Congress to impeach a president,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cAny such actions are to be taken very solemnly, seriously and in my view prayerfully.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/251666_6435746_updates.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
