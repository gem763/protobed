USA TODAY\n\nSan Diego Padres pitcher Jacob Nix was arrested earlier this week in Arizona after allegedly trying to break into a home in the middle of the night through a dog door.\n\nPeoria police tell ABC15-TV in Phoenix that the homeowner found Nix, 23, entering his house Oct. 6 and kicked him in the face. When another man tried to pull Nix back through the dog door, the homeowner fired a Taser that hit Nix in the back.\n\nPolice were called and later tracked down Nix and the other man, Thomas Cosgrove -- also a Padres pitcher -- a few blocks away.\n\nThe Padres' Jacob Nix last played in the major leagues in 2018, posting a 7.02 ERA in 42 1/3 innings.
