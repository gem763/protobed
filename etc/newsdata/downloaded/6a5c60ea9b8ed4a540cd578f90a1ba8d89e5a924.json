After studying to be an engineer at Brooklyn Technical High School, he decided to become a transit cop \u2013 then considered one of New York\u2019s most dangerous jobs. He would rise to become Deputy Commissioner of the NYPD, and revolutionize crime fighting along the way.\n\nMaple created a system called CompStat, for Complaint Statistics, that involved mapping instances of crime, initially across the subway system. When Mayor Rudy Giuliani tapped Bill Bratton \u2013 then head of the transit police \u2013 for the post of NYPD Commissioner, Bratton brought Maple along to implement CompStat citywide. Increasingly sophisticated computer mapping, combined with weekly meetings to craft strategy and demand results from precinct commanders, helped the CompStat system reduce New York City crime by 60%.\n\nJack Maple was considered the foremost authority on urban crime reduction and served as a consultant for cities across the globe before his death in 2001.", "description": "One New York cop made the city safer for all", "authors": ["Michael Daly", "Alex Chancey", "Special Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492195710/articles/2014/09/06/jack-maple-the-cop-who-transformed-new-york-city/140829-daly-tales-tease_hljp2n", "published_at": "2014-09-06"}
