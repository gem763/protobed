He\u2019s talking about the moment he and his wife, Betina, discovered that their child, Tatenda, was intersex. Although she had been raised as a boy, Tatenda had railed against the strict masculine norms in her hometown of Gutu, Zimbabwe. She wore high heels, dressed in skirts, and expressed a desire to change her gender. It wasn\u2019t until Tatenda underwent an operation for a hernia, however, that her condition became medically salient to her parents\u2014the surgeon found \u201csomething like an ovary\u201d in the child\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cI just knew it. I felt it in my gut. I\u2019m a girl,\u201d Tatenda says in the short documentary She\u2019s Not a Boy, from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, premiering on The Atlantic today. \u201cThere\u2019s no explanation more than that.\u201d Robert Tokanel and Yuhong Pang\u2019s film is a poignant and ultimately inspiring window into the life of an intersex individual. Like many intersex people, Tatenda struggles to assert herself in a world that is largely ignorant of, and often discriminatory toward, her identity.\n\nIntersex is an umbrella term that describes a variety of conditions in which a person is born with sex characteristics that don\u2019t conform to binary definitions of female or male. According to the United Nations, up to 1.7 percent of babies are born intersex\u2014a figure that is roughly equivalent to the probability of being born a redhead.\n\n\u201cI was confused when I first saw the word intersex, so I went online to look it up,\u201d Pang told me. \u201cThe more I learned about Tatenda and her backstory, the stronger I felt I wanted to make a film about it. Her courage and resilience in embracing her true identity and living with it in pride every day can really empower other intersex people who are facing similar situations.\u201d\n\nIn the film, Tatenda\u2019s father says he wishes that Zimbabwean society, which is extremely conservative on gender and sexuality matters, would understand \u201cthe nature of Tatenda.\u201d But it\u2019s not just Zimbabwe\u2014in the United States, a lack of education about intersex conditions has caused a pervasive morass and stigma.\n\nPang says people often confuse the concepts of transgender and intersex. \u201cUsually the first assumption people may have after learning that a person raised a boy grew up to be a woman is that they are transgender, but the reality is sometimes more complicated than that,\u201d she told me. For example, many intersex individuals, such as Tatenda, are assigned a gender at birth due to their external genitalia. Only later in life do they learn that they have different internal sex organs or hormones, or a combination of male and female chromosomes (such as XXY). Some people live their whole life without ever discovering they\u2019re intersex.\n\nIn many countries, including the United States, doctors recommend gender-assignment surgery for babies born with ambiguous genitalia. Many believe that these surgical interventions are driven by a fear of nonbinary bodies. \u201cCorrective surgeries are medically unnecessary and can be physically and psychologically devastating,\u201d Tokanel said. \u201cThe parents of children born intersex are often confused and frightened by the diagnosis and think they\u2019re making the best decision for their child, but they\u2019re totally unaware of the potential irreversible harm they\u2019re causing because a doctor who is in a position of authority has told them to act quickly to avoid the stigma of being \u2018different.\u2019\u201d\n\nMany intersex people find that the stigma extends into the LGBTQ community. In one scene in She\u2019s Not a Boy, Tatenda explains how she feels uncomfortable joining the Pride parade in New York City. \u201cThe queer community does a poor job of holding space and creating awareness and identity safety for intersex people,\u201d Tokanel said. \u201cGiven that reality, many intersex people aren\u2019t living publicly \u2026 Tatenda is a rare and brave example of a person who is willing.\u201d\n\nTokanel and Pang found Tatenda\u2019s story to be particularly resonant because of her supportive and loving relationship with her parents. \u201cDespite all the discrimination against their daughter, Tatenda\u2019s parents, Betina and Isaiah, were among the first few people that fully accepted her and even defended her in their community,\u201d Pang said.\n\nOn the last day of filming in Gutu, Tatenda\u2019s mother invited Tokanel and Pang to attend church services with the family. \u201cShe told us that bringing us to their church would be one of their proudest moments, because it would show people that Tatenda had made it through hard times and that people wanted to learn more about her because she was so special,\u201d Tokanel said. \u201cEveryone deserves that kind of familial love, but queer people don\u2019t always manage to form those kinds of bonds with their parents.\u201d\n\nThe film ends with a strong declaration from Tatenda. \u201cI am a black woman, an immigrant, and an intersex woman,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is something that is built automatically to destroy me. But from that, I rise.\u201d", "description": "She was raised as a boy.
