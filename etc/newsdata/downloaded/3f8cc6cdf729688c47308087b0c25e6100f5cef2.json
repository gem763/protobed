Surprisingly \u2014 as I\u2019m sure you already know \u2014 finding porn online is an easy task requiring just a quick Google search.\n\nGovernments are working to make it one-step harder to access porn online. Yesterday, Australia\u2018s Department of Home Affairs proposed to start scanning porn viewers\u2019 faces and match them up with government photos to verify their age using its \u2018Face Verification Service\u2019 \u2014 an image database of Australian citizens that is managed by government agencies.\n\n\u201cHome Affairs is developing a Face Verification Service which matches a person\u2019s photo against images used on one of their evidence of identity documents to help verify their identity,\u201d the government agency wrote in a submission. \u201cThis could assist in age verification, for example by preventing a minor from using their parent\u2019s driver licence to circumvent age verification controls.\u201d\n\nThe Australian government has been developing its face-matching service and it\u2019s not currently fully operational, and won\u2019t be until Parliament passes the Identity-matching Services Bill 2019 \u2014 which was recently rejected by the security committee over fears of privacy safeguarding.\n\nSimilarly to Australia\u2019s recent efforts to prevent minors from finding porn online, the UK scrapped its controversial plan to require age verification for accessing porn online, after repeated delays. The Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said the measure \u2014 which was initially scheduled to go into effect in March 2018 \u2014 \u201cwill not be commencing.\u201d Instead, the government plans to accomplish the goal of \u201cprotecting children online\u201d as part of a \u201cproposed online harms regulatory regime.\u201d\n\nAs fears loom around online privacy protection, questions have been raised as to how effective this tool could be. Earlier this year, the Guardian reported on just how easy it is to bypass age-verification checks \u2013 it took them less than two minutes to fool one of the flagship verification products.\n\nRight now, only time will tell if the Australian government goes ahead with facial-recognition, or if the proposal will meet a fate similar to its UK counterpart.", "description": "Australia's Department of Home Affairs proposed to start scanning porn viewers\u2019 faces and match them up with government photos to verify their age.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2F200-calories-1-8.png&signature=b7ac332a9044acf5fbc1b9a8e1f9b230", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
