Then, take the two band ends and clasp them behind you by using the loosest hook setting,\" said Rissa.\n\nShe said you should be using the loosest hook if your bra is fairly new, but as your bra stretches over time you should move out to the tighter inner clasps.\n\nThat said, if your new bra only fits on the tightest setting and you cannot comfortably use the last hook, you may want to go down a band size to ensure you won't be stretching out your bra prematurely.\n\nAlthough your bra is technically on your body at this point, you still need to make sure the bra is properly supporting your breasts\n\nTo do this, Rissa said you have to position your chest comfortably within the bra cups.\n\n\"Bend forward and, using the opposite hand, scoop your breast so that it is fully cupped in your hand,\" said Rissa. \"From here, reposition your breast so it is entirely in the bra cup, with the nipple in the center.\"\n\nOnce you've done this, stand up straight and double-check that your bra band is straight across your back - it should be parallel with the floor.\n\nIf your straps feel loose, adjust them so they gently press against your skin. You want them to be snug, but not so tight that they leave marks on your skin when you take off your bra.\n\nEven if you don't follow this method, you should try to avoid inverting your bra's cups as you put it on\n\nBra-fitting expert Kimmay Caldwell explained to Insider that many people use what is known as the \"crush and flip\" method to put on their bras, which isn't always the best idea.\n\nThis method involves hooking the bra in the front with the cups inverted (upside down with the outside of the molded cups against the body) before grabbing the straps and yanking them over the shoulders, flipping the bra in the process.\n\n\"Though this method is not 'wrong,' it is so bad for your bra,\" said Caldwell. \"It's one of the main reasons that underwires pop out and bras stretch out.\"\n\nPlus, flattening the molded cups against the body distorts their shape over time.\n\nIf hooking your bra from the back is difficult, try hooking it from the side instead\n\nIndividuals who struggle to put on their bra while the clasps are on their back may want to try hooking their bra while the clasps are on their side instead.\n\n\n\n\"You can start by hooking the bra on the side - not in front of you, if possible, so that you're twirling the bra less around your body,\" said Caldwell. \"The main thing is to start with the cups already facing up so you aren't inverting molded cups against your body or flipping the underwires up.\"\n\nOnce you have secured the bra closures, spin the bra around and make sure the fullest part of your bust sits comfortably in the bra cups before lifting the straps over your shoulders one by one.\n\nAlthough better than clasping your bra in the front, this method can stretch out your bra quickly over time, so you may want to consider purchasing bras that have front closures if you find yourself doing this often.\n\nIn addition, those who have difficulty raising or bending their arms may want to purchase bras that they can step into\n\nIf you have difficulty lifting your arms or can't hook your bra while it's on your body, you may want to consider getting bras that use wide elastic bands rather than traditional hook-and-eye closures.\n\nThese types of bras can often be stepped into rather than maneuvered over the shoulders.\n\nJust be sure you get one that fits comfortably and that you are not stretching the bra's band more than necessary, as this can compromise the support you get from the bra and actually make it less comfortable over time.", "description": "Insider consulted with bra-fitting experts to figure out the correct way to wear these popular garments so you can feel as comfortable as possible.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2763/ae7f8742cd0a4c07a5f7ecf08c95af07.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
