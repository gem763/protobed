Some of their statements were focused on a July 25 phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine in which Trump repeatedly brought up his desire for investigations into political rivals. Others touched specifically on Trump\u2019s decision in July to hold up the $391 million package of security aid to Ukraine, a development that government officials there said they only learned about at the end of August.\n\nOCT. 16, 2019\n\n1. President Donald Trump\n\n\u201cNow, all of a sudden, quid pro quo doesn\u2019t matter because now they see, in the call, there was no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In remarks at the White HouseThe New York Times also found several other instances of Trump\u2019s proclaiming \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d on Twitter, in remarks to reporters, in news conferences and at political rallies.\n\nOCT. 3, 2019\n\n2. Vice President Mike Pence\n\n\u201cContrast that with the president\u2019s \u2014 the transcript of the president\u2019s phone call with President Zelenskiy where there was no quid pro quo. There was no pressure.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In remarks to reporters\n\nOCT. 3, 2019\n\n3. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know is there was definitely no quid pro quo. I mean, it came out over and over.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In remarks to reporters\n\nOCT. 13, 2019\n\n4. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\n\u201cIn the Oval Office, when the president was asked about this in front of the vice premier, the president made very clear, they can do what they want. So, again, people who are trying to imply that the president is asking for things or quid pro quos, I think this is ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In an interview on ABC\n\nOCT. 4, 2019\n\n5. Lou Dobbs, Fox Business Network host\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not a difference of opinion. Any rational person looking at it, any reasonable person, can only conclude that there was no quid pro quo. There was no threat of any kind.\u201d\n\n\u2014 on Fox News\n\nSEPT. 28, 2019\n\n6. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president\n\n\u201cAnd as the president said, this was a perfect call. The Ukrainian president said on live TV the other day, up at the United Nations General Assembly, that he felt no pressure. And, in fact, if you read what\u2019s there, you see what\u2019s not there \u2014 no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In an interview on Fox News\n\nSEPT. 26, 2019\n\n7. Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser\n\n\u201cThere was no quid pro quo. There was no issue about finally getting the military assistance. And he thanked us. The Ukrainian president thanked us for our support on his anti-corruption campaign.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In an interview on Fox News\n\nOCT. 14, 2019\n\n8. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La.\n\n\u201cAnd I think a lot of these members in swing districts are hearing that, hey, you ran saying you were going to work with people to get things done and all you\u2019re focused on is impeaching the president over a lie about quid pro quo that never even happened. What are you people doing up there?\u201d\n\n\u2014 In an interview on Fox Business Network\n\nOCT. 14, 2019\n\n9. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y.\n\n\u201cPresident Zelenskiy had no idea that there was a hold on aid during the July 25th call. The readouts of the July 25th call on both the Ukraine side and the U.S. side mention nothing about a hold on aid or a quid pro quo. July 26th, the day after that phone call, Ambassador Volker met with President Zelenskiy. During that meeting, there was no reference to a hold on aid or a quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In remarks to reporters\n\nOCT. 13, 2019\n\n10. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D.\n\n\u201cThere was no quid pro quo in the \u2014 in the phone conversation. So, no doubt that the haters are going to hate.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In an interview on CNN\n\nOCT. 13, 2019\n\n11. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas\n\n\u201cI think that was good because a lot what the Democrats had been raising, alleging an illegal quid pro quo, was not, in fact, backed up by the transcript.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON -- It was not the message that the White House and its supporters have been trying to hammer home in recent weeks as the impeachment investigation has intensified on Capitol Hill: Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said Thursday that President Donald Trump withheld military", "authors": ["Linda Qiu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EC.bdu0FnjBsVi_KvXs.mA--~B/aD0yNjQ5O3c9Mzk3MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/e9c3ec60-f1a5-11e9-b7fb-0ffa8b30c8d9", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
