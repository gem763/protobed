He dishes it out a lot so the boys would be more than happy if he has to pay it.\"\n\nAfter the match, England players revealed coach Eddie Jones had been behind the unusual way they lined up, with captain Owen Farrell, seen smiling during the haka, saying: \"We wanted not to just stand there and let them come at us.\"\n\nNo comment was available from World Rugby about whether England will face disciplinary action.\n\nEngland will bid to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for a second time when they return to Yokohama for this Saturday's final against two-time champions South Africa.\n\nKick-off is at 11:00 SA time.", "description": "A World Rugby video trumpeting England's response to the New Zealand haka in their Rugby World Cup semi-final has earned millions of views online.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7994/ce7f3e0b84304f758ceca7936d4bc855.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
