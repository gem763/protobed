If there is an impact, the same impact will happen here in Europe,\u201d he said, referring to the prospect of European reprisals against Boeing.\n\n\u201cIt is a lose-lose impact,\u201d Scherer told reporters.\n\nAirline traffic growth has slowed this year amid broader trade friction between the United States and China. Airbus said protectionism and other geopolitical risks \u201cremain a concern\u201d.\n\nThe planemaker shaved 0.1 percentage points off its average annual growth forecast to 4.3 percent over the next two decades, but said demand for air travel essentially remains strong.\n\nDomestic travel in China is expected to leapfrog the United States and Western Europe within a decade, while India and fast-rising manufacturers like Vietnam are growing the fastest.\n\nAirbus predicted the world\u2019s fleet would more than double to 47,680 jets by 2038. That is slightly smaller than the fleet it was forecasting a year ago, because planes are flying with more seats and working for longer each day, pushing up productivity.\n\nBut the demand for new jets needed to reach that target has been revised upwards because Airbus believes airlines will also replace existing jets more quickly to tap improved fuel savings.\n\nAirbus said it now expects airlines and leasing companies to take delivery of 39,210 new passenger jets and freighters over the next two decades compared to 37,389 previously forecast.\n\nShares in Airbus edged up 0.7%, outpacing a flat market.\n\nCALL FOR BIOFUELS\n\nTouting the industry\u2019s record in cutting emissions, in a week that Swedish teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg pressed the U.S. Congress for action on climate change, Airbus said the industry could achieve its carbon-reduction goals even while meeting strong travel demand, because of new technology.\n\nEnvironmental groups backing a global \u201cclimate strike\u201d say more radical steps are needed to avert a disaster.\n\n\u201cWe are on a path to de-carbonise but we can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d Scherer said, calling for investment in sustainable biofuels.\n\nAirbus revised up its demand forecast for the industry\u2019s most-sold single-aisle jets by 4% to 29,720 planes but cut the medium segment including its A330neo by 2% to 5,370.\n\nIt followed U.S. rival Boeing in scrapping separate forecasts for the world\u2019s largest aircraft after deciding to halt production of the Airbus A380 due to weak demand.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Airbus is pictured at their facility in Montoir-de-Bretagne near Saint-Nazaire, France July 12, 2019. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File Photo\n\nIt now includes these aircraft with the largest twin-engined jets, with the resulting combined category up 22% to 4,120 jets.\n\nAirbus raised a 20-year forecast for services like repairs, training and cabin upgrades to $4.9 trillion from $4.6 trillion.\n\nOnce focused mainly on building their jets, Airbus, Boeing and other manufacturers are stepping up competition for a slice of this market to gain access to lucrative recurring revenues.", "description": "Airbus warned of the risks of a 'lose-lose' transatlantic tariff war on Wednesday as it raised forecasts for jetliner demand over the next 20 years, led by the new industrial hubs of Asia.", "authors": ["Tim Hepher", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431130158&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0FQ", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
