One idea that was suggested, according to multiple Republican sources who attended the meeting, is allowing a lawmaker\u2019s term as ranking member to not count the same as a chairmanship.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile the discussions are still in the early stages and no vote has been, it\u2019s a significant consideration for House GOP leaders, who have come under pressure from President Donald Trump to scrap term limits amid a growing list of Republicans who are heading for the exits.\n\n\u201cWe had talked about it. There\u2019s always people who argued a ranker shouldn\u2019t count in term limits,\u201d said retiring Rep. John Shimkus of Illinois, a member of the GOP steering committee. \u201cBut Kevin did think maybe a ranker should equate as one full year, versus two.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there may be some movement on not getting full credit. \u2026 They may just value it less,\u201d he added.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe steering committee decided to make at least one change to its term-limits policy: Republican lawmakers voted to ensure a half-term doesn\u2019t count toward the cap.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s a narrow step, the move could appease longtime Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), who took over the House Ways and Means Committee in November 2015 when Paul Ryan relinquished its chairmanship to become speaker. Now, Brady can stay on as the panel\u2019s top Republican until the end of 2022. If someone like Brady were to retire, it would deliver another devastating gut punch to the GOP.\n\nAs the retirements started to pile up over the past few months, Trump called on the House GOP to abolish term limits, saying the current policy \u201cforces great people, and real leaders, to leave after serving.\u201d\n\nAt least two Republicans who were facing term limits in 2020 have called it quits: Former Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway of Texas and former House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop of Utah \u2014 currently the ranking members on their respective committees.\n\nAnd Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, is also facing retirement rumors because he will be term limited next year.\n\n\u201cHouse Republicans should allow Chairs of Committees to remain for longer than 6 years,\u201d Trump tweeted earlier this month. \u201cThe Dems have unlimited terms. While that has its own problems, it is a better way to go. Fewer people, in the end, will leave!\u201d\n\nBut while the caps have prompted some complaints within the Republican Party, others have argued that the turnover in chairmanships has brought fresh blood into the top ranks of the GOP \u2014 unlike in the Democratic Party, which imposes no limits on its committee chairmanships and has created a bottleneck of power in its caucus.\n\nEven McCarthy defended the GOP\u2019s term limits earlier this month.\n\n\u201cYou can always look at something,\u201d McCarthy said when asked whether the policy has contributed to the wave of retirements. \u201cBut I love the idea of fresh blood.\u201d", "description": "Kevin McCarthy floated the idea of changing the GOP\u2019s rule that allows members to lead a committee for only three terms.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona", "John Bresnahan"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7b/a6/625b050548cbbdc4ea7529b940dd/190924-mccarthy-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
