We'll look at Lockheed Martin Corporation's (NYSE:LMT) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. What is Lockheed Martin's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 18.7. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 5.3%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nHow Do You Calculate Lockheed Martin's P/E Ratio?\n\nThe formula for price to earnings is:\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio = Share Price \u00f7 Earnings per Share (EPS)\n\nOr for Lockheed Martin:\n\nP/E of 18.7 = $386.56 \u00f7 $20.67 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)\n\nIs A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?\n\nA higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.\n\nHow Does Lockheed Martin's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?\n\nThe P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that Lockheed Martin has a lower P/E than the average (23.3) P/E for companies in the aerospace & defense industry.\n\nNYSE:LMT Price Estimation Relative to Market, September 9th 2019 More\n\nLockheed Martin's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with Lockheed Martin, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.\n\nHow Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios\n\nP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.\n\nLockheed Martin's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 136% last year. The cherry on top is that the five year growth rate was an impressive 16% per year. So I'd be surprised if the P/E ratio was not above average.\n\nDon't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank Deposits\n\nThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.\n\nSuch spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.\n\nIs Debt Impacting Lockheed Martin's P/E?\n\nLockheed Martin has net debt worth 11% of its market capitalization. That's enough debt to impact the P/E ratio a little; so keep it in mind if you're comparing it to companies without debt.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Lockheed Martin's P/E Ratio\n\nLockheed Martin's P/E is 18.7 which is about average (17.5) in the US market. Given it has reasonable debt levels, and grew earnings strongly last year, the P/E indicates the market has doubts this growth can be sustained. Given analysts are expecting further growth, one might have expected a higher P/E ratio. That may be worth further research.\n\nStory continues", "description": "This article is written for those who want to get better at using price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios).
