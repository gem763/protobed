In the past occupied Saudi villages have been briefly entered, whereupon troops have raised the group\u2019s flags and withdrawn.\n\nMeanwhile military officials from the Yemeni government, who are also fighting the rebels, said they believed the soldiers the group claimed to have captured were in fact fighters recruited informally by the Saudi-led coalition to fight inside the kingdom\u2019s borders.\n\nThe alleged show of force follows a drone attack on a major Saudi oil field earlier this month \u2013 an assault initially claimed by Houthi soldiers but blamed on Iran by leaders from the UK, the US and the kingdom itself.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen on the side of the government after the Iran-backed Houthis ousted President Abedrabbo Mansour\u200b Hadi in 2015.\n\nThe military operation against Houthi rebels has resulted in ten of thousands of casualties and created a massive humanitarian crisis in one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\nThe conflict has sparked famine and cholera outbreaks, with both sides accused of targetting civilians.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Saudi Arabia should not underestimate military ability of the Houthis", "description": "Houthi rebels in Yemen say they have killed 500 Saudi soldiers and taken a further 2,000 hostage in a major assault near the Saudi Arabian border.While little evidence was offered to back up their assertions, Houthi rebel spokesman Yahia Sarie said forces had \"liberated 350 kilometers square\u201d of", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2bIxx3DRU4W6cvZDX0.jAA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/9402dc24e01518c70058156e69555ae6", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
