Asked how he responds to those who say he\u2019s not gay enough, Colin Jost\u2019s Pete Buttigieg replied, \u201cYou know, I've heard that, but there's no wrong way to be gay\u2026 unless you're Ellen this week.\u201d\n\nKate McKinnon\u2019s Elizabeth Warren fared a lot better. \u201cIf someone doesn't want to serve gay people at their small business, I bet that's not the only thing that's small,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when people say gay and trans people shouldn't be included in civil rights protections, well, I wish their parents had used protection.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was Hamilton creator Lin Manuel-Miranda debuting his Julian Castro impression. He strode out onto the stage to cheers before apologizing for not being gay. \u201cHowever, I am Latino, which we can all agree is something,\u201d he said, nicknaming himself \u201cLatinobama.\u201d\n\nFinally, season premiere host Woody Harrelson made his triumphant return to SNL as Vice President Joe Biden and managed to be only slightly more awkward than he was at the actual CNN event earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of people in America are not homophobic,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey're just scared of gay people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what homophobic means, Joe,\u201d Alex Moffat\u2019s Anderson Cooper replied.\n\n\u201cLook, you know me, I went to bat for marriage equality and I believe we\u2019re all equal,\u201d Biden added, \u201cwhether you're gay, lesbie, transgenital or queef, you're OK with Joe.\u201d Then, to prove just how gay friendly he is, he planted a kiss on Cooper.\n\n\u201cYou just helped me win a bet, Joe,\u201d the CNN host said. \u201cI think we\u2019re done here.\u201d", "description": "The Equality Town Hall cold open sketch also featured the debut of Lin Manuel-Miranda\u2019s Julian Castro and a cameo from \u201cPose\u201d star Billy Porter.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1432,w_2545,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570939042/WH_yd0wdt", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
