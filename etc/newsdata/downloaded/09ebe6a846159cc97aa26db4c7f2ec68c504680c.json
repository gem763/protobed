I want to pay if it\u2019s worth it,\u201d he said.\n\nHotels are also introducing dynamic pricing in their room rates including Centurion International, which operates over 20 hotels in Japan.\n\nCenturion began using AI to collect information to charge higher prices when demand is strong, and offer discounts when demand falls to reduce vacancies.\n\n\u201cThe system provides us information on competitors such as the pace of reservation, which is great. It\u2019s a big advantage,\u201d said Hironobu Bun, revenue manager at Centurion International.\n\nCHANGING MINDSETS\n\nEconomists believe it will take more meaningful structural changes to Japan\u2019s economy to revive stagnant prices, which will in turn help businesses deal with sticky overheads and restore profits.\n\nHowever, developments like the adoption of dynamic pricing lay the groundwork for more radical changes in how companies set prices for their goods and services.\n\n\u201cIf dynamic pricing can change people\u2019s mindset so that they believe price can fluctuate more, there\u2019s a chance firms may be able to raise prices more easily where demand is strong,\u201d said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.\n\nAt the same time, other businesses are looking at more cosmetic ways to drive the consumer to accept higher prices.\n\nJapan\u2019s \u201cgyudon\u201d beef rice bowls have become a symbol of the country\u2019s deflation due to their aggressively low prices. But some outlets are turning that trope around by offering \u201cpremium bowls\u201d with better-quality meat for more than double the standard price.\n\nThe 500,000 \u201csukiyaki\u201d beef rice bowls offered by fast-food chain Yoshinoya Holdings Co in August were sold out in about two weeks - much faster than the company had expected - despite a price tag of 860 yen per bowl, double that of a standard dish.\n\n\u201cThe customer response has been good. If they see value in it, they would pay even if price is a little higher,\u201d said Yuji Terasawa, a spokesman of the company.\n\nWhile such tactics seem to work, they take careful planning and preparation. Fast Retailing Co Ltd, whose budget clothing chain Uniqlo boomed during the country's deflation era, learned the hard way when sales slumped after it raised prices in 2014. reut.rs/25Osyyo\n\nIn contrast, discount barber chain QB House earlier this year raised prices for a 10-minute haircut to 1,200 yen from 1,080 yen, explaining it was needed to increase salaries to secure better-trained barbers.\n\nThat move followed eight years of checking the customer mood through regular marketing surveys.\n\nWhile the hike triggered a 2% decline in customers from the previous year, the drop was much smaller than the company\u2019s projection of a 6% fall.\n\n\u201cThe price of a haircut is still lower than other places,\u201d said Kazuaki Mimura, a 34-year-old employee of a service-sector firm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to accept a hike of a few hundred yen because the service here is quick and my haircut is done properly.\u201d", "description": "After years of soggy inflation and the long reign of Japan's tight-fisted shoppers, businesses in the world's third-largest economy are adopting new methods to lift prices, from artificial intelligence to simple packaging tweaks.", "authors": ["Kaori Kaneko", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433997631&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P06C", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
