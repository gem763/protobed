It's a good time for the Smiths right now,\" Will shared. \"We're enjoying each other.\"\n\nIn Gemini Man, Will stars as Henry Brogan, an elite assassin who becomes the target of a mysterious operative who can seemingly predict his every move. To his surprise, he soon learns that the man who is trying to kill him is a stronger, faster cloned version of himself, who's only 23 years old.\n\nLooking to the real-life younger versions of himself -- specifically his 26-year-old son Trey, from his first marriage to Sheree Zampino, and his 21-year-old son Jaden, whom he shared with Jada -- Will admitted he sees a lot of himself in his kids, but that there's a lot that makes them very unique.\n\n\"They both have a lot of my qualities and the qualities of their mothers. They're both good mixes,\" Will shared. \"But what I'm noticing is how different this generation is from our generation. It's one of the biggest generation gaps in history.\"\n\n\"Technology has created a gigantic generation gap. They are growing up in a different world than we grew up in,\" he added, \"So they are very different human beings than me.\"\n\nWhile the world has changed and evolved over the last two decades, so has the actor's marriage to Jada, which the pair prefer to call a \"life partnership.\" And for Will, a lot of the longevity of their relationship it stems from understanding the nuance and work that goes into forging a real love and connection.\n\n\"There's a certain amount of suffering you have to be willing to endure, and most people cannot endure the pain that it takes to actually love somebody in their wild youth and imperfections,\" Will explained. \"It's easy to love somebody if they do everything you want, if they act how you want them to act and they don't do anything you don't want them to do.\"\n\n\"But, you know, Jada and I, we've weathered some storms and that's really for me, the only way that you can get to the other side,\" he added.\n\nAs their red carpet family night shows, It seems that no matter what they've gone through, they still know how to support one another.\n\nGemini Man hits theaters Oct. 11.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nWill Smith Talks Budapest Birthday, Says His Kids Don't Appreciate His Dance Skills 'At All' (Exclusive)\n\nWill Smith Calls Emergency Family 'Red Table Talk' After Hitting His Highest Weight Ever\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith Get Candid About Alcohol Use in 'Red Table Talk' Sneak Peek\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "'It's a good time for the Smiths!'", "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QvEIwd.x1GU7g_IRUjkL8Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/a17e28fb1a2d333ab9900a1ef9bf7093", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
