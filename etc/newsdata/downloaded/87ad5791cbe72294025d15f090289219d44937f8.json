Another game of football ruined by racists.\n\n\"Thanks to YTFC players and staff who backed our decision to leave the pitch.\"\n\nHaringey boss Loizou labelled the scenes \"very distressing\" and claimed he doesn't care if they get thrown out of the competition.\n\nLoizou told BBC Radio 5 live: \"It's very distressing. The abuse a few of my players got was disgusting.\n\n(Image: Eddie Keogh for The FA/REX)\n\n\"We've worked hard all week, had a great experience in the FA Cup last season and a silly two minutes has taken everything away from us.\n\n\"It wasn't consistent throughout the game. They got a penalty and as they were lining up to take it, my goalkeeper got spat at and had a bottle thrown at him.\n\n\"The referee managed to calm things down, they took the penalty and then my number six - Coby Rowe - got called names. He got racially abused and there was no way I could let him continue.\n\n\"The FA Cup's not worth that much to us. We are never going to win it.\n\n\"Good luck to Yeovil Town if we get punished and thrown out, all be it, I don't care.\"", "description": "The FA Cup fourth qualifying round match with Yeovil was abandoned after the home side walked off the pitch", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Twitter", "Georgi Licovski Epa-Efe Rex", "Eddie Keogh For The Fa Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645016.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_UEFA-EURO-2020-Sofia-Bulgaria-14-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
