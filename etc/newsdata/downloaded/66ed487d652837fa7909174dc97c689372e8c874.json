But she brought it up and apologised.\n\n\u2018I think she felt bad but relieved to say sorry and she cried a little bit. I got emotional for once. I gave her a big hug, like \u201cI have to forgive you a little bit now\u201d.\u2019\n\nTheir tour was also blighted by the back and forth between Mel B and Geri after Mel claimed she had had sex with her band mate at the height of their fame.\n\nCelebrity Juice continues tonight at 10pm on ITV2.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
