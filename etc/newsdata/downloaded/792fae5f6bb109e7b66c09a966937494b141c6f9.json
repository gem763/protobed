The \"debt avalanche method,\" on the other hand, focuses on the balance with the highest interest rate first.\n\nWhile people have their preferred methods, either debt repayment method can make a big difference, and either is significantly better than letting credit card debt grow.\n\nRead more personal finance coverage.\n\nAccording to data from the US Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve, more than 40% of all US households have credit card debt, with the average American household carrying a balance of $5,700.\n\nIn some states, such as Alaska and Wyoming where average household credit card debt is $13,048 and $11,546 respectively, many people are simply drowning in credit card bills.\n\nWith the average credit card APR now nearing 18%, it can seem impossible for consumers to keep up with interest charges and make a sizeable dent in their balances each month.\n\nThat's where debt repayment strategies come in \u2014 specifically, the popular \"debt snowball\" and \"debt avalanche\" methods. In each method, you prioritize your debts to pay off certain liabilities faster, although they go about it in a different way.\n\nWhat's the difference between the debt snowball and debt avalanche?\n\nThey both begin the same:\n\nWrite down exactly how much debt you have, along with the interest rate on each account. If it's unclear from your credit card statements, you might want to make a few phone calls to be sure. Figure out how much income you bring home each month, and where that money is currently going. Decide where in your budget you're going to find some money to put toward your debts. Most people using these methods look for ways to cut spending to free up more cash for the snowball or avalanche.\n\nNow, choose a method to destroy your debts \u2014 once and for all.\n\nThe debt snowball crushes the smallest debts first\n\nWith this method, you'll make a list of each of your debts, their amounts, and their interest rates, then figure out how much money you can allocate to debt repayment every month.\n\nOnce you have those figures ready, you'll strive to pay the minimum payment on all your debts except for the smallest one. On that debt, you'll pay whatever's left in your allotted debt repayment fund for the month \u2014 as in, however much you can.\n\nRead More: How I paid off $80,000 worth of debt by my 30th birthday\n\nHere's an example of how it could work if you had the following debts:\n\nCredit card 1: $12,000 balance at 17% APR with a minimum payment of $360\n\nCredit card 2: $7,000 balance at 15% APR with a minimum payment of $210\n\nCredit card 3: $1,000 balance at 12% APR with a minimum payment of $45\n\nPersonal loan: $3,000 balance with a 7% APR, minimum payment of $100\n\nIf you had the debts outlined above, you would pay the minimum balance on credit card 1, credit card 2, and your personal loan. Then you would throw all your extra money for debt repayment toward your smallest balance \u2014 credit card 3 \u2014 and continue doing that for however long it takes to make that debt disappear.\n\nRead more: Personal Loans 101: How they work and who can qualify for them\n\nOnce that debt is gone, you move on to your next smallest debt: your personal loan, even though it carries a lower interest rate than your remaining credit cards.\n\nWhy people choose the debt snowball: It's incredibly satisfying to cross debts off the list! The debt snowball comes with a feeling of accomplishment as you crush your debts from smallest to largest.\n\nHowever, some people might notice that if you run the numbers, the debt snowball isn't necessarily the most cost-efficient way to pay your debts, since your most expensive debts (those with the highest interest rates) might not be first priority.\n\nThat's why the debt avalanche exists.\n\nThe debt avalanche tackles the most expensive debts first\n\nThe debt avalanche works the exact opposite way of the debt snowball. Instead of prioritizing your smallest debts first, you'll prioritize your highest-interest debts in order to maximize your savings on interest.\n\nLet's use the same example from above. Your hypothetical debts are:\n\nCredit card 1: $12,000 balance at 17% APR with a minimum payment of $360\n\nCredit card 2: $7,000 balance at 15% APR with a minimum payment of $210\n\nCredit card 3: $1,000 balance at 12% APR with a minimum payment of $45\n\nPersonal loan: $3,000 balance with a 7% APR, minimum payment of $100\n\nAgain, you'll start by making the minimum payment on all of your loans: the personal loan at 7% APR, the $1,000 credit card balance at 12% APR, and the $7,000 balance at 15% APR. Then, you'll concentrate the rest of your allotted debt repayment funds toward one account: the one with the highest interest rate.\n\nRead More: A financial planner shares an 8-step plan to paying off your credit-card debt\n\nInstead of starting with credit card 3, the smallest balance, you'd start with credit card 1, which has the highest interest rate (17%).\n\nWhy people choose the debt avalanche: Since you're prioritizing debts with the highest interest rate, this method is the most mathematically efficient option and the one that will save you the most money on interest.\n\nSince you aren't tackling your smallest debt first, it might take longer to crush your first debt and get the feeling of accomplishment that comes with it.\n\nIf you're struggling to decide between the debt snowball and the debt avalanche method, don't overthink it too much. Either strategy would leave you much better off than doing nothing at all \u2014 the most important thing is to start.\n\nMore coverage from How to Do Everything: Money", "description": "If you want to get out of debt, the \"debt snowball\" or \"debt avalanche\" strategies could help.
