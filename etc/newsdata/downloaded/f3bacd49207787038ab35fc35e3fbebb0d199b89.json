For Beijing, it was the spinoff credibility Trump initially earned with his steely approach to North Korea, along with the secondary sanctions on China for undermining those against Pyongyang, and the trade war he defiantly launched against China.\n\nNevertheless, the president persists in claiming success in his man-to-man friendship with Xi and Kim. Some observers recall the unquenchable optimism of President Obama\u2019s lead official on Asian affairs who seemed incapable of referring to Beijing\u2019s communist officials as anything other than \u201cour Chinese friends.\u201d\n\nLike the Obama team, Trump fails to note that the personal warmth is not reciprocated. Xi never calls the U.S. president a friend or expresses any admiration for his leadership qualities. (Kim, according to the president, does send occasional \u201clove letters\u201d but their content remains secret.)\n\nBut the Chinese do transmit flattering messages to Trump through useful emissaries. Michael Pillsbury, an outside adviser with close ties to both the White House and Chinese officials, told a C-span audience that China\u2019s leaders are impressed with Trump\u2019s \u201cbig brain.\u201d A professed former \u201cpanda hugger,\u201d then a supposed \u201crealist\u201d on China, Pillsbury has become a born-again panda-whisperer to the president. He urges Trump to abandon his earlier approach, the stronger policies favored by militaristic \u201csuper hawks\u201d such as former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nMost recently, he praised Trump\u2019s warm congratulations to Xi on the occasion of Beijing\u2019s military parade extravaganza celebrating 70 years of Communist Party dictatorship \u2014 even as it was cracking down on mostly peaceful protestors in Hong Kong. In response to critics, Pillsbury explained that the president\u2019s message was intended to maintain his personal relationship with Xi while confronting China on trade. He said Trump \u201cdoes not want to start a Cold War with China or seek to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo further demonstrate his good intentions, the president told Xi in a June 18 phone call he would remain quiet on Hong Kong if trade talks progressed. When members of both parties questioned the propriety of the statement, Trump injected a measure of moral concern and said he hoped Xi would \u201cdo the right thing\u201d on Hong Kong.\n\nIn his subsequent speech at the United Nations, the president made a more fulsome human rights appeal: \u201cThe world fully expects that the Chinese government will \u2026 protect Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life.\u201d\n\nHe said Xi\u2019s international prestige is on the line: \u201cHow China chooses to handle this situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader.\u201d\n\nXi, not impressed by the preemptive compliments, gave his answer in remarks on Oct. 1: \u201cUnity is iron and steel; unity is a source of strength.\u201d\n\nReferring explicitly to both Hong Kong and Taiwan, he declared: \u201cThe complete reunification of the motherland is an inevitable trend; it is what the greater national interests entail and what all Chinese people aspire for. No one and no force can ever stop it!\u201d (Beijing\u2019s exclamation point.)\n\nXi has skillfully played off one issue against another in the multi-dimensional U.S.-China relationship, always in the cause of advancing Beijing\u2019s core interests and long-term ambitions. As this article was nearing completion, the already complex dynamics of the U.S.-China relationship suddenly became even more complicated and Xi was given a new card to play to America\u2019s disadvantage.\n\nPresident Trump Donald John TrumpTrump campaign slams Minneapolis mayor, Target Center for 'attempting to extort' them with rally security fees Susan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report MORE publicly asked the Chinese communists to unearth damaging information on his political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden. Xi, after all, has proven adept at discovering, or manufacturing, evidence of corruption to destroy his own political enemies.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump also mentioned the next phase of trade talks: \u201cThe Chinese are coming in next week. \u2026 I have a lot of options on China. But if they don\u2019t do what we want, I have tremendous, tremendous power.\u201d His warning about linkage and consequences seemed clearly to apply to the trade issues, not to American domestic politics.\n\nBut it has been reported that in the same June conversation with Xi where he promised to tread lightly on Hong Kong, he also did make a partisan political appeal. Given that background, reporters asked whether a possible China corruption investigation would influence the trade talks. The president said, \u201cOne thing has nothing to do with the other.\u201d\n\nBut the seed has been planted. It would be unfortunate if Xi and his colleagues believe they now have new leverage and less need to be cooperative, not only on trade but also on the range of security and human rights issues in contention with the United States. If China\u2019s leaders, mistakenly or not, sense that kind of opening, they could harden their stance on Hong Kong, Taiwan, South China Sea, the Uighurs and other issues.\n\nParadoxically, it could work the other way as well. Trump, aware of the suggestion of linkage and vulnerability his comment has created, may well adopt an even firmer posture on one or more issues with China, including North Korea.\n\nFor an American president, addressing the human rights nightmares in both countries would constitute an important values act in its own right. But it also would serve as a non-kinetic way of restoring the progress his maximum pressure campaign was on the verge of making \u2014 and still could make \u2014 in the critical area of national, regional and global security.\n\nJoseph Bosco served as China country director for the secretary of Defense from 2005 to 2006 and as Asia-Pacific director of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief from 2009 to 2010.
