North Dakota and Iowa's bands have been struck down permanently.\n\nTemporary holds have been places on the bans passed in Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri and Mississippi.\n\nThe bans passed in Louisiana, Missouri, Georgia have not yet taken effect, and if Mississippi's is struck down in federal court, Missouri's will go with it.\n\nEven where bans aren't in effect, states have found other ways to make abortions hard to come by.\n\nTexas and Tennessee, for example, have both banned abortions after 21.6, unless a woman's life is in danger or the fetus has a 'severe abnormality.'\n\nMifepristone, used in combination with misoprostol, trigger abortions that women can manage themselves at home, but require a prescription\n\nWomen must also wait 24 hours after finding out they are pregnant to have an abortion in Texas. In Tennessee, they must wait 48 hours.\n\nThat may be prohibitive for women who work busy schedules and must travel hours from home to get to the nearest clinic that offers abortions.\n\nMissouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia, North Dakota and South Dakota each have just one legal abortion clinic remaining.\n\nBut medication abortions offer a cheaper, less time-consuming way for women to abort pregnancies before 10 weeks.\n\nIn 2000, the 'abortion pills,' a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe combination can safely end a pregnancy at home and is 97 percent effective.\n\nA prescription is required to get the drugs, but with the advent of telemedicine, the necessary consultation can happen online.\n\nDuring the 10-month period between October 15, 2017 and August 15, 2018, 6,022 people in the US requested orders of these medications online, according to the new study by University of Texas at Austin researchers.\n\nNotably, this data comes from Women on the Web (WoW), an online telemedicine platform that offers medication abortions to women in countries where terminating pregnancy safely is not possible - but doesn't sell the drugs in the US.\n\nPreviously, the Aid Access, run by Dr Rebecca Gomperts, provided the pills to women around the world, including the US.\n\nBut in March, the FDA issued a warning letter to Dr Gomperts and Aid Access.\n\nPro-life Americans support laws like fetal heartbeat bans. Protesters have also returned day after day to Planned Parenthood and other clinics that offer abortion in efforts to deter women from using the services, as these seniors did in 2011 (file)\n\nSo although people submitted requests for the drugs, none of them were completed, according to the study authors.\n\nThe vast majority of these orders were placed by people living in states with laws that restrict access to surgical abortions.\n\n'These results suggest that state policies restricting access to abortion have made it harder for some people to access care in the clinic setting, and so they look online for alternatives,' said lead study author Abigail Aiken, an assistant professor of public affairs at UT Austin.\n\nBut, she noted, people from all 50 states requested medications abortions.\n\n'In both states that have passed many abortion restrictions and states that have passed fewer, people are motivated by a combination of barriers to clinic access and a preference for at-home care,' said Aiken.\n\nAnd the sheer volume of requests placed to that one organization suggests that there's a significant demand for at-home medication abortions in the US - and making it available could give women a safe option in areas where there otherwise isn't one.", "description": "A University of Texas at Austin study found that the vast majority of attempted orders for abortion pills online were placed in states like Mississippi and Texas with strict abortion laws in place.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/22/19892544-0-image-a-2_1571432845049.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
