So when we\u2019re talking to prospects \u2014 the words they use, the pain point they use \u2014 are very similar from call to call to call? Once we see that pattern, we know we have product-market fit, and then we can replicate that.\n\nJyoti Bansal: Revenue is one measure of product-market fit. Are customers adopting it and getting value out of it and renewing? Until you start getting a first set of renewals and a first set of expansions and happy successful customers, you don\u2019t really have product-market fit. So that\u2019s the only way you can know if the product is really working or not.\n\nWhitney Bouck: It isn\u2019t just about revenue \u2014 the measures of success at all phases have to somewhat morph. You\u2019ve got to be looking at usage, at adoption, value renewals, expansion, and of course, the corollary, churn, to give you good health indicators about how you\u2019re doing with product-market fit.\n\nGenerating early revenue\n\nJyoti Bansal: As founders we\u2019ve realized, getting from idea to early revenue is one of the hardest things to do. The first million in revenue is all about street fighting. Founders have to go out there and win business and do whatever it takes to get to revenue.\n\nAs your revenue grows, what you focus on as a company changes. Zero to $1 million, your goal is to find the product-market fit, do whatever it takes to get early customers. One million to $10 million, you start scaling it. Ten million to $75 million is all about sales, execution, and [at] $75 million plus, the story changes to how do you go into new markets and things like that.\n\nWhitney Bouck: You really do have to get that poll from the market to be able to really start the momentum and growth. The freemium model is one of the ways that we start to engage people \u2014 getting visibility into the product, getting exposure to the product, really getting people thinking about, and frankly, spreading the word about how this product can provide value.", "description": "Last week at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco, we hosted a panel on the Extra Crunch stage on \u201cHow to build a billion-dollar SaaS company.\u201d A better title probably would have been \u201cHow to build a successful SaaS company.\u201d We spoke to Whitney Bouck, COO at HelloSign; Jyoti Bansal, CEO and founder at Harness, and [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48832882793_61e61f37bd_k.jpg?w=600", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
