Goldsmiths are legally allowed to buy cyanide, which is used to extract gold and polish it, but it is illegal for them to sell it. Both men say they are innocent.\n\nThe graveyard of Lourd Matha Church in Koodathayai has been upturned. Freshly placed candles adorn the Thomas family crypt, where the remains of Ms Joseph\u2019s in-laws were recently exhumed for forensic testing.\n\n\u201cI just pray that we can bring my family members justice. You don\u2019t know what it does to me as a daughter, as a sister, to see my loved ones\u2019 remains after so long, taken from their graves,\u201d said Renji Thomas. She is the sister of Roy Thomas, the husband Ms Joseph stands accused of poisoning.\n\nNow, neighbours and relatives \u2013 including Ms Joseph\u2019s two sons with Thomas \u2013 have been left to wonder if anything they thought they knew about her was true.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But for 17 years, she embarked on a daily, hour long commute to Calicut, also known as Kozhikode. Where she actually went in the city is now a matter of intense police interest and town gossip.\n\nMs Joseph and Mr Thomas met at a housewarming party and quickly fell in love, family members say. He was drawn to her easy smile, her smarts, her university degree and her willingness to help those in need.\n\nWhen the couple wed in 1997, Ms Joseph entered the tight-knit Thomas family, moving into her in-laws\u2019 home in Koodathayai.\n\nMs Joseph\u2019s mother in-law, Annamma Thomas, a former schoolteacher, kept the house buzzing, tutoring children and hosting big dinners for family and friends, as well as an annual Christmas party that was the biggest in town.\n\nBut after a few years, they began clashing over money, according to family and friends. Annamma was in charge of the family accounts.\n\nIn 2002, five years after Ms Joseph had moved into the family home, Annamma died a painful death. She had been unwell, and one day, Ms Joseph urged her to sit down and relax, promising a warm bowl of goat soup to ease her churning stomach. Investigators say the soup was laced with cyanide. Annamma collapsed and died, frothing at the mouth.\n\nThe Christmas parties grew smaller and eventually stopped. Friends and family stopped coming by, feeling the house had grown cold under its new matriarch, Ms Joseph, said Mohammed Bava, a neighbour who lives across the street.\n\nHe said Tom Thomas, Ms Joseph\u2019s father-in-law, became reclusive after his wife\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cHe became very sad and silent, and increasingly came under Ms Jolly\u2019s control. He stopped interacting with all of us,\u201d said Mr Bava, who grew up playing in the Thomas household.\n\nTom\u2019s relationship with his children started deteriorating. Property disputes emerged, family and friends say, with Ms Joseph demanding that the family home be put in her and her husband\u2019s name.\n\nIn 2008, her father-in-law died after eating a snack. Ms Joseph was said to have found his crumpled body on the floor. A will emerged, naming Roy Thomas as the sole inheritor of his father\u2019s fortune. But the will had no date or witnesses and was considered invalid, family and friends said.\n\nWhen Roy Thomas died suddenly in 2011, after retching violently in a locked bathroom, Ms Joseph told people that it had been a heart attack.\n\nA year later, in 2012, a second will for Tom Thomas turned up, naming Roy and Joseph as the chief inheritors. It was signed by witnesses no one in the family had heard of. Now that Roy was dead, Ms Joseph stood to inherit the entire family fortune.\n\nMathew Manchadiyil, Roy\u2019s uncle, grew suspicious. He demanded an autopsy. After resisting, Ms Joseph finally buckled under family pressure. The cause of death was listed as cyanide poisoning, doctors said.\n\nBut she would not share the autopsy report with the rest of the family. Tearfully, she told the family that Roy had committed suicide \u2013 that he had been an alcoholic who snapped under financial pressure and drank cyanide to end his life.\n\nMr Manchadiyil demanded a police investigation. For the next two years, he challenged her claims to the family property and the validity of the will.\n\nIn 2014, Mr Manchadiyil died under unclear circumstances. Once again, it was Joseph who found the body.\n\nHer next victim, the police say, was Alphine, her two-year-old niece.\n\nAlphine was the daughter of Shaju Zacharias, Roy\u2019s first cousin. Alphine died months after Mr Manchadiyil did, after eating a snack soon after her older brother\u2019s first communion. Alphine\u2019s mother died in 2016, collapsing on the floor after drinking a glass of water that Ms Joseph handed to her, according to the police.\n\nA year after his wife\u2019s death, Mr Zacharias married Ms Joseph. The police have questioned him several times, but he says he had nothing to do with the death of his wife and daughter, and he has not been detained.\n\nWhatever suspicions Renji and her brother Rojo had about Ms Joseph deepened after her marriage to Mr Zacharias. The property disputes between Ms Joseph and her first husband\u2019s siblings continued.\n\nRenji filed a lawsuit in January to contest ownership of a plot of land. As part of the suit, she had access to her brother\u2019s post-mortem for the first time. And one glaring discrepancy stood out.\n\nAt the time, Ms Joseph had gone out of her way to explain that Roy had died of a heart attack while she was cooking dinner. Her insistence on this seemingly banal detail \u2013 that he died on an empty stomach \u2013 received little attention at the time. But the post-mortem stated clearly that he had died within minutes of eating a curry dish \u2013 his favourite kind, which his wife often cooked for him.\n\nRenji and her brother, who lives in the United States, decided to file a police report months later. This month, Ms Joseph was detained by the police. Her two sons now live with their Aunt Renji, who says they have been devastated.\n\nWhen asked during a phone interview what she might say to Ms Joseph if she were to see her again, Renji paused.\n\n\u201cLet me be frank. I would say, \u2018Thank you for keeping your two sons alive, as they are now my children, and now I have five children,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAt least I could save them \u2013 they are my blood.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "She was a pillar of her small community, respected by her neighbours as a distinguished professor, a solemn widow and a churchgoer whose religious devotion only seemed to grow, despite a string of personal tragedies.
