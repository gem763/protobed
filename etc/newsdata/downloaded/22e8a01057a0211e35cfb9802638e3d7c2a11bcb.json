We have to ensure equitable distribution of resources,\" said Sharif, a former town planner and mayor of Penang island, off Malaysia's west coast.\n\nBut increasingly, planners are ignoring the poorest and most vulnerable residents including slum dwellers and street vendors, said Renu Khosla, director of the Centre for Urban & Regional Excellence in New Delhi.\n\n\"Our cities are not being planned for the poor. But when cities are planned without people in mind, you get more informal settlements, you get more inequality,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\"Perhaps it's time to move away from territorial and land-based planning, and plan around people and their needs.\"\n\nFrom Bangkok to Manila, as Asian cities strive to become more modern, street vendors and hawkers are viewed increasingly as a hindrance to city planning and are being evicted from pavements.\n\nBut public spaces are for the good of all members of the public and must be legally available to everyone, said Chidchanok Samantrakul at WIEGO, a global non-profit that helps informal workers.\n\n\"Half the city is informal - informal settlers, street vendors - yet planners only focus on the formal. But there has to be opportunity for everyone to co-exist,\" she said.\n\nSeveral cities in the region are now using Minecraft, a video game that allows players to build their own worlds using virtual Lego-like pieces, to get communities to participate in upgrading their common spaces, under a UN-Habitat programme.\n\nIn the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, where women and girls often face harassment on the streets and on public transport, Minecraft was used to identify safety issues and make public spaces safer, said Thu Dao Thi Bao of non-profit Plan International.\n\n\"Technology helps give girls and women a voice. We have to encourage their participation in city planning and management.\"\n\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.
