We\u2019ll save these lives one patient, one addict, one treatment center at a time.\u201d\n\nThe Socialist (voice of Bernie Sanders): \u201cThis is obviously an economic crisis! People are despairing because their jobs have been outsourced, their wages are stagnant, the rich have hijacked the economy. Tax the plutocrats, raise the minimum wage, give everybody health insurance, and you\u2019ll see this trend reverse.\u201d\n\nThe Cultural Healer (voice of Marianne Williamson): \u201cYou can\u2019t just medicate this away or solve the problem with wonkery alone. There\u2019s a spiritual void in America, a loss of meaning and metaphysical horizon. The problem is cultural, spiritual, holistic; the solution has to be all three as well.\u201d\n\nI have written this for the voices of Democratic candidates, but there is an equivalent for Republicans: Instead of the Technocrat, imagine the Enforcer, talking about drug interdiction and border security; instead of the Socialist, the Populist, talking about China and wage subsidies and industrial policy; instead of the Cultural Healer, the Preacher talking about the need for a religious revival while the Online Nietzschean bellows from backstage about restoring masculinity.\n\nAre any of these prescriptions plausible? The Senate report leans toward the technocratic answer, arguing that the surge in drug deaths is distinct from and more dire than the suicide and alcohol trend and clearly driven by \u201cchange in the supply, addictiveness, and lethality of drugs\u201d \u2014 which suggests that policymakers should keep their focus on the opioid problem specifically, rather than assuming that every trend driving death rates higher must be solved together.", "description": "Are deaths from drugs and alcohol and suicide a political, economic or spiritual crisis?", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/opinion/08Douthat/08Douthat-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
