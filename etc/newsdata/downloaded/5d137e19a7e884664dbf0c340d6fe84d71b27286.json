However, she came to a decision in tonight\u2019s episode, as she tested how much Rainie wants to be a part of Abi\u2019s life by putting some drugs in her possession.\n\nEarlier this week, Kathy took pity on Rainie and gave her an opportunity to prove herself by offering her a trial shift in the cafe. However, things didn\u2019t go as planned, and she later found Rainie on the floor of her flat with a bottle of vodka in her hand. In tonight\u2019s episode, she quizzed Callum (Tony Clay) about how Rainie had been coping, but when Stuart (Ricky Champ) got wind of Kathy\u2019s interference, he wasn\u2019t best pleased.\n\nHe later confronted Kathy in the cafe and accused her of putting Rainie\u2019s recovery at risk by snooping. As a result, he threatened to stop her from seeing Abi if she didn\u2019t back off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Kathy refused to let Stuart intimidate her, and thus she stopped by Max\u2019s (Jake Wood) once more to discuss what had happened. As they talked about Rainie\u2019s drug habit, Max made it clear that \u2014 as long as she\u2019s addicted to drugs \u2014 she will continue to put her habit above everything else. As a result of this conversation, Kathy came up with an idea to test that theory.\n\nKathy stopped by Callum\u2019s flat once more to pay Rainie a visit, and proceeded to inform her how she wants nothing more than for her to be a part of Abi\u2019s life.\n\nRainie was taken aback, and promised that Kathy can trust her. However, Kathy decided to test Rainie, and thus removed a packet of drugs from her bag and left them nearby Rainie \u2014 thus prompting her to make a choice.\n\nThe options are: the drugs or remaining in Abi\u2019s life.\n\nWhich will Rainie choose?\n\nEither way, it\u2019s safe to assume Stuart won\u2019t be too pleased if he hears what Kathy\u2019s done!\n\nEastEnders continues on Friday 11th October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Kathy delivered quite the ultimatum.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kathy-and-rainie-in-eastenders_1570727917.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
