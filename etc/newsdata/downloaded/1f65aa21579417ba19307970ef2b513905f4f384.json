Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected per-share earnings of $1.24. Revenue rose 13.6% to $33.06 billion, beating analysts projections.\n\nThe Redmond, Wash., company has enjoyed a strong period of higher earnings, in part because of Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella's bet on cloud computing, a model where customers rent computing power instead of buying their own machines.\n\nRevenue for Microsoft's commercial-cloud operations, which include Azure computing services, Office 365 tools and other cloud services, increased 36% to a record $11.6 billion.\n\nMicrosoft reported sales for its three main product areas in the quarter ahead of its guidance.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood called it a strong start to the fiscal year.\n\nMicrosoft shares were 0.38% lower in after-hours trading.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 16:55 ET (20:55 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
