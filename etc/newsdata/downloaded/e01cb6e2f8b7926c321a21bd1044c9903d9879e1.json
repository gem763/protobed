He could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\n\nImages of the unit from before his ownership show a true blank white box with shabby wood floors, a kitchen space and bathroom. The unit didn\u2019t even have a certificate of occupancy at the time, Mr. Steinberg said.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Frida Kahlo\u2019s Works to Headline Christie\u2019s Latin American Art Auctions\n\nThe seller\u2019s aesthetic choices and attention to detail, the agent said, reflect a passion for fine yachts, which tend to employ stripped-down clean design and light neutral colors to help maximize their limited space.\n\n\n\nThe home also benefits from \u201cfortress\u201d-like two-foot-thick walls, which block out the noise from its location on busy Broadway, and windows on three sides, Mr. Steinberg said. The apartment also comes with access to a shared rooftop terrace.\n\n\n\nThirty-plus year ago, the 11-story building was home to Environ, a performance space that hosted some of the city\u2019s leading jazz musicians and performers of the mid-\u201970s, including jazz great Dave Brubeck, avant-garde composer Laurie Spiegel and dancer Martha Graham, according to the listing agency.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-120936?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
