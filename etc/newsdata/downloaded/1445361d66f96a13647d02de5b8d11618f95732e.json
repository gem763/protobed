We deal with a completely different situation.\u201d\n\nJones also used the appearance to claim that all the pressure for Saturday\u2019s semi-final had been piled up on the All Blacks, given that they are seen as the best team in the world with the biggest support and the have the chance to make three-peat history on the line following their 2011 and 2015 triumphs.\n\n\u201cWe don't have any pressure,\u201d he added. \u201cPut up your hand if you think we can win. There you go, no one. No one thinks we can win.\n\n\u201cThere are 120m Japanese people out there whose second team are the All Blacks. So there's no pressure on us, we've just got to have a great week, enjoy it, relax, train hard and enjoy this great opportunity we've got, whereas they've got to be thinking about how they're looking for their third World Cup and so that brings some pressure.\u201d\n\nThe 59-year-old also returned to the subject of facing the sack had they lost their quarter-final against Australia last weekend, given the Rugby Football Union\u2019s minimum expectation of reaching the semi-final stage \u2013 though his claim that the English press claimed that there will be \u201cblood on the walls of Twickenham\u201d appeared somewhat misguided given that the phrase could not be found on the internet.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t see too many hands go up,\u201d he said. \u201cYour first reaction is always your most honest reaction, and if you don\u2019t put your hand up straight away you don\u2019t believe it. And you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou look, one week ago, I was going to get sacked, Owen [Farrell] couldn\u2019t kick, someone wrote there\u2019d be blood on the walls of Twickenham. Now we are in a semi-final and have a chance of going through, and we are just excited about it.\u201d\n\nHansen was unable to respond to Jones\u2019s comments given that his press conference took place before the Australian\u2019s, though he did seem to see what was coming.\n\n\u201cMind games are a real thing, but sometimes you\u2019re better not to bother going there and sometimes you are,\u201d the New Zealand coach said. \u201cEddie will decide whether he wants to go there and I\u2019ve already decided what I want to do.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait and see, I guess. There\u2019s still a couple more days to go. There\u2019s no point is there? He\u2019s a smart man. He knows me and I know him.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones took a swipe at the New Zealand\u00a0media on Tuesday by labelling them \u201cfans with a keyboard\u201d due to their vocal support of the All Blacks.
