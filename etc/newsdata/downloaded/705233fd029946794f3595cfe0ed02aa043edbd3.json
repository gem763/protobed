To his dismay, Zuerlein, a first-team Pro Bowler in 2017, missed wide right.\n\nGreg Zuerlein : 3/4 FG's (Missed the potential game-winning 44-yard FG with 11 seconds left) pic.twitter.com/BquBHKJFoU \u2014 Lee Harvey (@AyeThatsLee) October 4, 2019\n\nIt was a fitting ending for a compelling contest that saw more than 800 yards of total offense, seven touchdowns and four second-half lead changes.\n\nThough they used to be the exception, close, entertaining, games have now become the rule on Thursday Night Football, which airs on a plethora of platforms including Amazon Prime, the NFL Network and Fox. Meanwhile, at the same time, comparable games on ESPN\u2019s Monday Night Football have shown a tendency to be blowouts, especially this season.\n\nConsider: Over the previous three seasons the average margin of victory on TNF was 13.3 points compared to 11.5 on MNF. This season, those numbers have almost completely flipped with the average margin of victory on MNF ballooning to 14 points compared to it shrinking to just 6.75 points on TNF.\n\nThe close games which TNF has been offering of late make it a much more compelling product to watch, as does its broadcast team of Joe Buck and Troy Aikman. Buck and Aikman\u2019s counterparts in the booth on MNF, Joe Tessitore and Booger McFarland, simply don\u2019t have the chemistry of their competitors on Fox nor have they really had the time to develop it thanks to the lack of continuity in ESPN\u2019s broadcast.\n\nWhile the ratings for last night\u2019s thriller in Seattle aren\u2019t in yet, there\u2019s a strong chance they\u2019re quite good as the first TNF game of the season on Fox last week drew ratings which were up 22 percent over last year\u2019s inaugural Thursday game on the network and were the second-best of any TNF broadcast that Fox has had, according to Deadline.\n\nThat\u2019s in sharp contrast to what\u2019s happening for MNF, as the ratings for last week\u2019s game between the winless Steelers and winless Bengals were down 16 percent compared to ESPN\u2019s comparable October 1, 2018 matchup.\n\nIs it a trend that will continue? Probably too soon to tell as TNF does have some poor matchups of its own on tap (4-0 Chiefs at 0-4 Broncos, 0-4 Redskins at 2-2 Vikings) while MNF has some good ones (2-2 Browns at 3-0 49ers, 2-1-1 Lions at 3-1 Packers) coming down the pike.\n\nEither way, thanks to an improved slate of games and a superior (and to be fair, familiar) broadcast crew, Thursday Night Football is no longer the mockable offering it once was.\n\nIt\u2019s not there yet, but Monday Night Football is certainly headed in that direction based on what\u2019s been happening thus far this season.", "description": "The close games which \"Thursday Night Football\" has been offering of late make it a much more compelling product to watch than \"Monday Night Football.\"", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178866783-e1570205437958.jpg?fit=860%2C573", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
