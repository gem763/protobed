Economists polled by MarketWatch has forecast a 0.1% gain.\n\nThe increase in wholesale inflation over the past 12 months, what\u2019s more, slid to 1.4% from 1.8%, marking the lowest level in almost three years.\n\nSimilarly, a more closely followed measure that strips out volatile food, energy and trade-margin costs was flat in September. The increase in the so-called core PPI over the past year dropped to 1.7% from 1.9%.\n\nWhat happened: Wholesale prices for goods fell 0.4%, with three-quarters of the decline reflecting the lower cost of gasoline. Wholesale food prices rose 0.3%, however.\n\nThe cost of services decreased 0.2%, the biggest drop in two and a half years. Wholesale service prices are notoriously volatile, however, and monthly changes generally shouldn\u2019t be taken at face value.\n\nStill, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any inflation building up at earlier stages of the production process. The cost of partly finished goods fell 0.4% in September and they are 3.4% lower over the past 12 months.\n\nRaw-material prices posted even sharper monthly and year-over-year declines, running 10% below September 2018 levels.\n\nBig picture: Inflation has settled slightly below 2% by most price measures and doesn\u2019t appear primed for a big move \u2014 up or down \u2014 anytime soon.\n\nThe low rate of inflation has given the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates to try to guard the U.S. economy from damage related to the ongoing trade war with China.\n\nRead: China fight seen dragging on through 2020 in threat to economy, Trump reelection\n\n\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.36% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.45% were set to decline in Tuesday trades. Stocks have been shaky over the past week amid signs the economy has weakened and rising political tensions in Washington.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.19% slipped to 1.53%. The yield has tumbled from a seven-year high of 3.23% 11 months ago on growing worries about the economy.", "description": "The wholesale cost of U.S. goods and services posted the steepest decline in September since the first month of the year, largely reflecting lower gasoline...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP111_yuan_d_ZG_20190808213508.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
