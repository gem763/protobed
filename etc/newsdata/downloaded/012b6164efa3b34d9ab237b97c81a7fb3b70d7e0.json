Benny Gantz, possibly weeks away from being Israel\u2019s next leader, would likely follow the same path as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on strengthening his country\u2019s alliance with the U.S., securing its borders and countering Iran at a time of crisis in the Middle East.\n\nBut Mr. Gantz, 60 years old, has pledged to steer a more unifying course for Israeli society, scaling back religion\u2019s place in daily life and concentrating less power in the hands of the prime minister. A Gantz-led government, should one emerge, could have implications for Israel\u2019s relations with American Jews and any future peace negotiations with the Palestinians.\n\nSuch a coalition would also return the premiership to the hands of a celebrated Israeli military figure. Some of the country\u2019s most heralded leaders, from David Ben Gurion to Menachem Begin and Ariel Sharon, share that heritage. Mr. Gantz served as the head of Israel\u2019s military from 2011 to 2015, while Mr. Netanyahu was the prime minister.\n\nMr. Gantz campaigned on offering a clean break from Mr. Netanyahu, whom he criticized for being corrupted by too many years in office. The prime minister could be indicted soon after a hearing next month on charges of bribery and fraud, which he denies.\n\nBlue and White party leader Benny Gantz campaigning on Sunday in Tel Aviv.

But Mr. Trump has described Mr. Gantz as a good person and said Wednesday that the U.S. relationship is with Israel, not any one leader.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How would Benny Gantz govern Israel differently than Benjamin Netanyahu? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Gantz has said he thought the Obama administration could have reached a better nuclear deal with Iran in 2015, from which President Trump withdrew at Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s urging. But at an event in Washington that year, the retired general said he also saw \u201cthe half-full part of the glass\u201d\u2014that the deal would keep Iran 10 or 15 years away from a nuclear weapon \u201cwith the right price.\u201d\n\nHe has wholeheartedly supported Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s campaign against Iran, as Israel has launched strikes against Tehran\u2019s positions and those of its allies in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. \u201cI am standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Prime Minister Netanyahu in the fight against Iran\u2019s aggression. I am certain he will do the same when I will be the Prime Minister of Israel,\u201d Mr. Gantz said earlier this year at the Munich Security Conference.\n\nIf Mr. Gantz gets a mandate to form a government from Israel\u2019s president, he would need to pull together a coalition among Israel\u2019s fractious political parties to become prime minister. He doesn\u2019t appear to have the votes to form a ruling coalition with parties to the left and the Arab parties. That leaves him with few options besides a broad, cross-party coalition, often called a unity government, which may involve some sort of power-sharing arrangement with Mr. Netanyahu himself. Mr. Gantz campaigned on a pledge to form a secular unity government without Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nMr. Gantz as Israeli military chief in 2014.

His closest political allies are, like himself, former generals who have taken hard lines on Israel\u2019s national security. He also counts Yair Lapid, a popular former television personality, as an ally who covers his flank on social issues, such as putting more of a barrier between Judaism and Israel\u2019s secular culture.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Gantz will most likely have to find a way to govern in some way with Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, but getting to such an arrangement will be a challenge. Mr. Gantz pledged not to sit with Mr. Netanyahu, while Likud members pledged not to ditch the prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe stumbling block is either Likud has to get rid of Netanyahu or Gantz has to swallow Netanyahu,\u201d said Reuven Hazan, a political-science professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\n\nMr. Gantz has shown he likes to avoid political conflict, Mr. Hazan said, and act as a consensus builder.\n\n\u201cHe tries to work things out,\u201d Mr. Hazan said, pointing to how the retired general ran his campaign. \u201cHe didn\u2019t let the conflicts in the party spill out and he didn\u2019t attack Netanyahu in the way he was attacked.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials said they are still considering when to release the Trump administration\u2019s Israel-Palestinian peace plan. Mr. Gantz has met with U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, but hasn\u2019t met Jared Kushner or Jason Greenblatt, the other members of the Trump administration\u2019s peace team.\n\nAfter the election, Palestinian officials said they would be ready to restart negotiations with whoever forms the new government. They have also said they don\u2019t anticipate much of a difference in Israeli policy with Mr. Gantz.\n\nThe difference between him and Mr. Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said on Tuesday, is like that \u201cbetween Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola.\u201d\n\nMr. Gantz has said he would put any Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank up for a public vote and would look to take unilateral steps if a peace deal can\u2019t be reached. \u201cIf it turns out that there is no way to reach peace at this time, we will shape a new reality,\u201d he said in February.\n\nMr. Gantz has said he opposes unilateral efforts to annex territory in the West Bank. But after Mr. Netanyahu pledged to annex the Jordan Valley several days ahead of the vote, Mr. Gantz said the large strip of land \u201cis a part of Israel forever.\u201d\n\nMany Israelis, including Mr. Gantz, consider that area on the Jordan border essential to Israel\u2019s security, including because its army can stop weapons smuggling there and prevent outside attacks. Palestinians consider the fertile area the breadbasket of a future state.\n\nOne place where Mr. Gantz clearly diverged with Mr. Netanyahu is Gaza, where the former general has urged a more forceful military response to Hamas\u2019s launches of rockets and flaming balloons. Mr. Gantz headed Israel\u2019s military during the 2014 war with Gaza, when Israel launched airstrikes on the strip in July 2014 and a ground offensive to destroy the dozens of tunnels the army determined had penetrated Israel.\n\nMr. Gantz has pledged to improve ties between American Jewry and Israel, which have frayed under Mr. Netanyahu, particularly because of his close relationship with President Trump.\n\nMr. Gantz said he opposed a decision to block Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) from visiting Israel earlier this summer.\n\n\u201cI think it was a mistake not to let [Omar and Tlaib] in, because we\u2019re strong enough to let people see with their own eyes,\u201d Mr. Gantz said earlier this month.\n\n\u2014Dov Lieber contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "description": "Retired Gen.
