John Bel Edwards (D) as he barrels toward reelection.\n\nVoters in Louisiana head to the polls Saturday for an all-party primary contest in which Edwards leads by a wide margin. If Edwards takes more than 50 percent of the vote, he would win the race outright; if not, he would face one of two Republicans vying for second place in a Nov. 16 runoff.\n\nIn hopes of avoiding what would be an embarrassing loss in one of the most conservative states in the country, Republicans are mounting a last-minute push to excite their base and dampen Edwards\u2019s numbers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVice President Pence appeared with the two leading Republicans, Rep. Ralph Abraham (R) and businessman Eddie Rispone, in New Orleans last weekend.

The Republican Governors Association and a super PAC funded by a prominent Louisiana donor have aired ads blasting Edwards for his handling of a sexual harassment scandal involving one of his former aides.\n\nBut Republicans have been unable to coalesce behind either Abraham or Rispone, and polls show Edwards \u2014 one of the last Southern Democrats to hold statewide office \u2014 on the brink of winning outright.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing how a state that\u2019s so red would be so enamored with a Democrat,\u201d state Rep. Larry Bagley (R) said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re pulling out the stops to try to hurt John Bel\u2019s numbers.\u201d\n\nA survey released Monday by the Louisiana-based firm JMC Analytics and Polling shows Edwards leading with 47 percent, ahead of Rispone\u2019s 22 percent and Abraham\u2019s 19 percent. A Mason-Dixon survey released Monday showed Edwards at 45 percent, Rispone at 22 percent and Abraham at 17 percent.\n\nRispone, a wealthy businessman making his first run for public office, has spent more than $11 million of his own money introducing himself to voters. He has positioned himself as an outsider capable of reforming state government.\n\nAbraham, serving his third term in Congress, has seen his support slip in recent weeks after Rispone launched a broadside against him. Abraham has struggled to raise enough money to stay on air; the most recent fundraising reports showed Rispone outspending Abraham eight times over.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey both have strong conservative values, and they\u2019re both get-it-done kind of guys,\u201d said state Sen. Beth Mizell (R), who is unaligned in the race. \u201cI\u2019m counting on it going to a runoff.\u201d\n\nIf the December runoff is necessary, history would argue for the Republican: No governor has ever won reelection when they have been forced to compete in a runoff.\n\n\u201cFor some middle-of-the-road Republicans, John Bel will be their first choice. They like that he works,\u201d said state Rep. Patrick Connick (R). \u201cIf Edwards doesn\u2019t take it in the first round outright, the last Republican candidate standing will be the favorite.\u201d\n\nEven with history against him, the most recent polls show Edwards would start a runoff in the lead. The Mason-Dixon survey shows Edwards leading Rispone by 9 points and Abraham by 15 points, though Republican voters would likely coalesce behind their nominee after the primary.\n\nEdwards has spent the last days of the election season running positive spots showcasing support from women voters, and from Republicans, while defending his handling of the sexual harassment scandal in which the aide was fired.\n\n\u201cHe brought members of both parties together to make the hard decisions,\u201d state Sen. Dan \u201cBlade\u201d Morrish (R) says in one of Edwards\u2019s advertisements.\n\nSeveral state legislators told The Hill they had seen few signs of the race beyond their television screens. But there are hints that Louisiana voters are excited to show up: More than 370,000 people cast ballots during the early voting period, an increase of 100,000 ballots from the 2015 race.\n\nThe early voting population may represent a concerning trend for Edwards: Of those who cast a ballot early, about 155,000 were Republicans, 60,000 more than turned out four years ago. The early electorate is whiter than it was four years ago, and more male.\n\nBut like other Southern states where ancestral Democrats regularly vote Republican, and like some ancestrally Republican suburbs that voted Democratic in the 2018 midterm elections, partisan affiliations are not as strong an indication of how voters are voting this year, said John Couvillon, the pollster behind JMC Analytics.\n\nEdwards has shown an ability to make inroads with Republican voters, especially Catholics who care about his anti-abortion stance; a recent advertisement his campaign paid for shows a photo of Edwards meeting Pope Francis Pope FrancisLouisiana GOP bring in big names to block Democratic governor Pompeo, Pope Francis urge protections of religious freedom The Hill's Morning Report \u2014 Trump takes aim at whistleblower MORE.\n\nAt the same time, white voters in rural areas have increasingly aligned themselves with Republican candidates, and especially President Trump, even if they don\u2019t bother to change their voter registration.\n\nThe specter of impeachment, thrown into the mix just weeks before voters head to the polls, threatens to upend a race that Edwards has tried to keep focused on Louisiana-specific issues.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is happening is you have a turbocharged political atmosphere just like you did last year during the Kavanaugh hearings,\u201d Couvillon said. \u201cThe tricky balance that a Southern Democrat has to make, particularly in a state like Louisiana where blacks are more than half of the Democratic Party base, is you\u2019re trying to energize a base while at the same time getting enough votes from independents and Republicans.\u201d", "description": "Louisiana Republicans are calling in their party\u2019s biggest surrogates in a last-minute push to stop Gov.
