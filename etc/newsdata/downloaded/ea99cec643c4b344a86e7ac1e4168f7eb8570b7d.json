As things stand, far too few parameters are covered by the existing IMO criteria for permitted discharge from scrubbers.\"\n\nShe added: \"Scrubbers are effectively cheat devices in that they satisfy environmental legislation, while allowing ships to continue to pollute. They are legal according to IMO rules, which allows shipping companies to wash their hands of their environmental responsibilities.\"\n\nHeavy metal pollution has been connected to damage to the central nervous system in humans and animals while PAHs have been blamed for skin, lung, bladder, liver, and stomach cancers.\n\nA bleached coral reef in the Maldives. Shutterstock/Emma Holman\n\nThe increasing acidification of the world's waters is killing coral reefs, something scientific studies have warned threatens entire oceanic food chains.\n\nBryan Comer, a senior researcher at ICCT, said the use of scrubbers by cruise ships is a particular concern.\n\nThe ICCT has estimated that cruise ships with scrubbers will consume around 4 million tons of heavy fuel oil in 2020 and will discharge 180 million tons of contaminated scrubber washwater overboard.\n\n\"About half of the world's roughly 500 cruise ships have or will soon have scrubbers installed,\" said Mr Comer. \"Cruise ships operate in some of the most beautiful and pristine areas on the planet, making this all the more concerning.\"\n\nScrubbers generally cost between \u00a31.6m and \u00a38.1m depending on the vessel \u2013 and the adoption of this technology has cost billions of dollars over recent years, according to Mr Comer.\n\n\"If you are conservative and say that ships are spending about $3m (\u00a32.4m) per ship to instal scrubbers, at 4,000 ships that's $12bn (\u00a39.7bn) dollars of investment in a technology that enables ships to use the world's dirtiest fossil fuel \u2013 heavy fuel oil.\n\n\"Worse, scrubbers increase fuel consumption by about 2 per cent, increasing carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\"Imagine how far $12bn could have gone if it was applied towards developing and deploying technologies for zero-emission vessels.\"\n\nUnder IMO regulations, ships are permitted to use open-loop scrubbers as what they call \"equivalents\". These are defined as: \"Any fitting, material, appliance or apparatus to be fitted in a ship or other procedures, alternative fuel oils, or compliance methods used as an alternative to that required.\"\n\nIn statement to The Independent, the IMO said: \"The intention behind that idea of equivalents is to allow for innovation.\"\n\nThough IMO member states have approved the use of open-loop scrubbers to meet the incoming sulphur cap, some regional ports have introduced rules to prevent their use.\n\nIn January, the UAE's Port of Fujairah announced a ban on the use of open-loop scrubbers in its waters.\n\nIn July, China said it would extend a ban scrubber discharges to cover all coastal regions within 12 nautical miles from China's territorial sea and regions near the southern island province of Hainan.\n\nAuthorities in Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the US have also implemented bans on scrubber discharge in some regions.\n\nIn May, EU member states made a submission to the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee calling for it to develop a set of \"harmonised rules\" on the areas and conditions under which scrubbers can discharge.\n\nIn response, the committee appointed a team to assess the available evidence relating to the environmental impact of discharges from scrubbers. This team is due to present its findings in February 2020.\n\nIn a statement issued to The Independent, the IMO said it had already \"adopted strict criteria for discharge of washwater from exhaust gas cleaning systems\".\n\nIt added that it is \"undertaking a review of the 2015 guidelines on exhaust gas cleaning systems. The guidelines include, among other things, washwater discharge standards.\"", "description": "The 'scrubber' devices circumvent environmental legislation by dumping pollution into the sea instead of the air.", "authors": ["Will Crisp", "The Independent"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d971a79591bb70844108f0b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
