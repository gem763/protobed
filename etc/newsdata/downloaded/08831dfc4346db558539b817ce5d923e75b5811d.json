Paul Parizek told a local NBC affiliate. \u201cThey made a report to the police department so that goes on our radar as a place we are going to want to give a little extra attention to.\u201d\n\nThe Register came under fire this week after reporter Aaron Calvin published a profile about Carson King, a 24-year-old Altoona man who went viral earlier this month for holding a sign on ESPN asking for donations on Venmo to pay for his \u201cBusch Light Supply.\u201d\n\nMr. King ended up raising more than $1 million after he said he would make a donation to the University of Iowa\u2019s Stead Children\u2019s Hospital and Anheuser-Busch and Venmo offered to match his donation.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Register and local media reported that Mr. King published two \u201cracist\u201d tweets in 2012 when he was 16 years old. Anheuser-Busch announced the same day that it was severing ties with Mr. King over the comments.\n\nThe mention of the tweets drew massive backlash against The Register, but the paper defended its editorial decision. Internet sleuths responded by digging up old tweets from Mr. Calvin, the reporter, who reportedly used a racist slur for black people and mocked gay marriage. Mr. Calvin later apologized and set his Twitter account to private.\n\nPolice said Wednesday that the paper has been forced to hire additional security at the Capital Square building.\n\n\u201cRight now they\u2019ve got some unique security concerns with some threats that may have come in, so I think it\u2019s an abundance of caution just trying to take care of your employees,\u201d Sgt. Parizek told the NBC affiliate. \u201cThey\u2019ve hired an off-duty police officer to provide a little extra security presence at their business.\n\n\u201cYou can have your opinion and exercise your first amendment right all you want but you cannot threaten people and you cannot threaten to commit crimes and if that happens and if we are able to identify you, you will probably be arrested,\u201d he added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
