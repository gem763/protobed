That\u2019s broadening the appeal of a technology that allows vehicles to run on the universe\u2019s most abundant element, releasing only water and heat as byproducts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a real change over the last 12 months,\u201d said Randy MacEwen, chief executive officer of Ballard, based in Burnaby just outside of Vancouver. In parts of Europe, operating a fuel cell-powered electric bus is now cost competitive with a traditional fuel-burning version, he says. Use of the technology is diversifying into ships, trains and forklifts.\n\nBallard is the second-best performing stock on Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index this year, pushing its market value to C$1.7 billion ($1.3 billion). It\u2019s more than doubled after scoring a Chinese investor and burgeoning speculation that wide-scale adoption of hydrogen fuel cells may at long last be around the corner.\n\nA string of deals this year have indicated the technology is penetrating the traditional automotive industry:\n\nPower company Cummins Inc. -- synonymous with the diesel engine for most of its century-old history -- bought Canadian fuel-cell maker Hydrogenics Corp. for $290 million in September.A truck maker controlled by Italy\u2019s billionaire Agnelli family, CNH Industrial NV, agreed to invest $250 million in Nikola Motor, a startup aiming to put hydrogen semi-trucks on the road.Robert Bosch GmbH, the world\u2019s largest auto-parts supplier, in April announced plans to mass produce fuel cells by 2022 in partnership with Powercell Sweden AB.\n\n\u201cI think the understanding of the value proposition is much stronger today,\u201d says MacEwen, referring to the edge that hydrogen has particularly in commercial vehicles: refueling with hydrogen is just as fast as filling up a truck or bus with diesel, while batteries can get too heavy when scaled up for larger vehicles.\n\nBallard believes it has around a 70% to 80% market share of the 3,000 fuel-cell buses and trucks currently deployed globally. It\u2019s focusing heavily on Europe where the cost of a fuel-cell bus has plunged to 375,000 euros ($417,000) from about 1 million euros in five years. MacEwen expects a quarter of key European cities to deploy fuel-cell buses by 2025.\n\nChinese Investor\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price has also soared since a decision last year by China\u2019s Weichai Power Co., a major diesel-engine maker, to buy a 20% stake in the company for $163 million, making it Ballard\u2019s top shareholder. Robert Brown, an analyst at Lake Street Capital Markets in Minneapolis, called it a \u201cblockbuster deal\u201d that positions fuel-cell technology to further penetrate the world\u2019s biggest vehicle market.\n\nThat market could boom with growing government support: vehicle manufacturers, gas suppliers, and other private-sector institutions have announced more than $17 billion in hydrogen fuel-cell investments as of June, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in a report last month.\n\nChina plans to subsidize the large-scale deployment of hydrogen cars and invest in refueling infrastructure, seeking to replicate the cost reductions and economies of scale that have made the country the biggest market for electric vehicles, according to the BNEF report.\n\nReverse Engineering\n\nBallard\u2019s success in China is a bright spot at a time of dimming business prospects for Canadian companies in China. Canada-China relations have frayed since Canada\u2019s arrest on a U.S. extradition request of Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s chief financial officer. Huawei has been at the center of U.S. concerns about Chinese intellectual property theft and national security risks.\n\nBallard itself has seen would-be Chinese competitors trying to reverse engineer its fuel-cell technology, MacEwen says. \u201cI personally have seen a facility in China that looked very similar to ours.\u201d\n\nSo far the Chinese firms have only been able to make the technology work for a short period of time, he says. Ballard has buses in the field that have been operating for 35,000 hours -- in contrast, the typical hydrogen fuel-cell powered passenger car is designed for just 5,000 hours of durability.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Canadian hydrogen fuel-cell pioneer Ballard Power Systems Inc. has hung on for four decades without posting a profit, waging a battle far head of its time against the combustion engine.It says its moment may finally be arriving.Fuel-cell and hydrogen costs are falling, while emissions", "authors": ["Natalie Obiko Pearson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kAQxZ3amwmmzLDeKamCanQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b5f9f19ede8de740acfc3c0d7d71ce25", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
