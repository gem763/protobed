On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Nokian Renkaat Oyj. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Nokian Renkaat Oyj!\n\nHLSE:TYRES Historical Dividend Yield, October 15th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 51% of Nokian Renkaat Oyj's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A payout ratio above 50% generally implies a business is reaching maturity, although it is still possible to reinvest in the business or increase the dividend over time.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Last year, Nokian Renkaat Oyj paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable.\n\nWe update our data on Nokian Renkaat Oyj every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Nokian Renkaat Oyj's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was \u20ac0.40 in 2009, compared to \u20ac1.58 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 15% per year over this time.\n\nIt's rare to find a company that has grown its dividends rapidly over ten years and not had any notable cuts, but Nokian Renkaat Oyj has done it, which we really like.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Nokian Renkaat Oyj has grown its earnings per share at 18% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly, but given that it is paying out more than half of its earnings as dividends, we wonder how Nokian Renkaat Oyj will keep funding its growth projects in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Nokian Renkaat Oyj's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we think Nokian Renkaat Oyj has an acceptable payout ratio, although its dividend was not well covered by cashflow. We like that it has been delivering solid improvement in its earnings per share, and relatively consistent dividend payments. Ultimately, Nokian Renkaat Oyj comes up short on our dividend analysis. It's not that we think it is a bad company - just that there are likely more appealing dividend prospects out there on this analysis.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Nokian Renkaat Oyj (HEL:TYRES) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P7BY2Hj94svDu3_lUJ_PhQ--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/7639dcd07d7693c4bf9e41271c2e3cfb", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
