According to his loved ones, Grujic remains in critical condition.\n\nA GoFundMe page has been created to help the Angel Families of Uribe and Grujic, as well as a GoFundMe page for Boskovic\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThis was a senseless and avoidable tragedy,\u201d Clarendon Hills Police Chief Paul Dalen said in a statement. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of Laura and Marko and we pray for a full recovery of the third victim.\u201d\n\nUribe\u2019s sister, Maria Uribe, told NBC 5 Chicago that Lauren had fallen in love with the city of Chicago and was merely \u201cfollowing her dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was really smart,\u201d Maria Uribe said. \u201cShe was following her dream. She fell in love with Chicago when she got here.\u201d\n\nThough prosecutors sought a $5 million bond for Rodea-Cruz, a judge placed a bond of $750,000 on him and he has been charged with aggravated DUI causing death and aggravated DUI causing great bodily harm. If convicted, the illegal alien faces a maximum prison sentence of 28 years. His next court appearance is November 25.\n\nThe sanctuary state of Illinois, which shields criminal illegal aliens from deportation, has seen a number of cases where illegal aliens who should have been deported from the U.S. went on to allegedly kill Americans. In June, 39-year-old father of two Corey Cottrell was killed when an illegal alien caused a hit-and-run crash.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
