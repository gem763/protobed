He turned Ederson around and beat his student in the chest. Once, twice, three times.\n\n'You're the man,' he roared. City had won 2-0 against Palace and Ederson produced an outrageous one-handed tip to deny Christian Benteke and thwarted Wilfried Zaha from close range, both in the final moments.\n\nEderson propelled his Manchester City team to victory for the second week in a row\n\nJohn McGinn holds his head in his hands after being denied by Ederson in the firs half\n\nThis week was no different. Again a clean sheet and again a couple of big moments. At 0-0, Ederson produced a splendid double-save when Aston Villa pounced on sloppy distribution by John Stones, parrying John McGinn's curling effort before denying Douglas Luiz.\n\nThese saves might not make the end-of-season highlight package \u2014 Raheem Sterling will dominate that if he keeps this run up \u2014 but they are having a significant impact on City's campaign.\n\nAt City, the No 9 is expected to be the first defender and the goalkeeper must be the first attacker. Ederson was the architect of Sterling's opener 21 seconds after half-time. Villa were powerless to stop him finding Gabriel Jesus before Sterling latched on and swept in.\n\n'It's a pass, not a long ball,' said Tom Heaton, Ederson's opposite number. 'You should never force it playing out from the back. Ederson suits the way they play and still has that long threat. It makes it difficult to stay compact if they can go over the top.'\n\nCity feel his distribution allied to his shot-stopping make him one of the world's best keepers and vindicates their decision to choose him over Bernd Leno when replacing Claudio Bravo. He certainly is 'the man' in City's eyes.", "description": "As he strode off at Selhurst Park last week, Ederson was caught by Xabi Mancisidor, Manchester City's goalkeeping coach.
