Where this could end is seen by studying the history of the last century. Ultimately it would lead to control over people`s right to choose anything for themselves.\n\nThe public should be under no illusions as to the detrimental effect this move would have on our schooling system and in turn the economy.\n\nTim Pocock\n\nAddress supplied\n\nThis is disturbing news to me, being the father of seven children, and grandfather to seventeen grandchildren.\n\nFor our children to be fully prepared for tomorrow\u2019s world, a sound education is both vital and critical, therefore what would Labour\u2019s motive be in this proposal?\n\nIs it really to better the chances of the students, or is just a political revenge against those who have benefited from such education, and who now occupy prominent positions in government?\n\nHow do Labour balance the need of millions to fund this scheme, and the billions saved for the country by independent schools?\n\nWhat consideration have Labour given to parental rights over the education of their children, as set out in the UDHR, ECHR, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU?\n\nIs not this proposal steering the country towards communism and socialism, giving the state the rights over our children and their education? Do we wish to bring the country to the level of debasing oppressive regimes as seen in these kind of countries?\n\nThis an extremely sensitive issue, where the wishes of parents for their children to be not only well taught, but for both their faith and consciences to be respected, must be taken into consideration.\n\nRoger Napthine\n\nBenington\n\nThomas Cook going bust is down to Brexit\n\nWhy is nobody in traditional media pointing out that a huge UK travel company based in the UK has gone bust because the UK has voted to leave the EU? It is so obvious. If a country decides as a majority that it hates \u201cabroad\u201d, wants to chuck out immigrants, refuses to allow those seeking asylum to enter the country and is happy for them to die at sea or be miserable in Calais, of course Thomas Cook will go bust. The Emperor is naked, people. Wake up.\n\nJonathan King\n\nLondon W1H\n\nMarr\u2019s \u2018attack dog\u2019 style is tiresome\n\nI read Tom Peck\u2019s column with interest but somewhat disagree over his interpretation of the Andrew Marr interview on Sunday. I actually felt that Corbyn tried to answer Marr\u2019s incessant questions about the latest Labour squabble with a certain amount of equanimity. Peck criticises his tone but it was just I feel to counter Marr\u2019s obvious growing irritation.\n\nI am sorry but I often end up shouting at the television \u201cAndrew, let him or her speak\u201d and actually answer one question. This \u201cattack dog\u201d modus operandi is actually very off-putting for the viewer and Marr has been perfecting this of late with complex quick-fire questions which in the end bring the focus onto him and not the interviewee. I felt he again employed this with Dominic Raab, trying to put him on the spot about Thomas Cook.\n\nRaab answered reasonably about the the ongoing position and stated that measures were in hand to deal with this serious situation. I have in the past contrasted Marr\u2019s modus operandi with Sky\u2019s Sophie Ridge who can be just as penetrating without the aggression, because it is so tiring and counterproductive for the silent partner in the discussion.\n\nJudith A Daniels\n\nGreat Yarmouth\n\nWhy not focus on social care?\n\nThe front page of your Daily Edition today is headlined Corbyn \u2018terrified\u2019 of becoming prime minister. We then discover this is just the opinion of an anonymous \u201csenior\u201d Labour figure. Well there\u2019s all the usual suspects such as Tom Watson and Wes Streeting of course, but whichever nasty piece of work provides this \u201cstory\u201d, the point is that this is merely another knife in the back to Mr Corbyn, and it should be beneath The Independent\u2019s dignity and fair-mindedness to give it any attention, never mind make it a front page story.\n\nA little further in we read that, if elected, Labour will completely overhaul the social care system so that vulnerably elderly people are no longer fleeced of their life savings and even their homes. I am right in the middle of such a nightmare as my husband has a severe degenerative condition which requires him to be in permanent nursing care. The anxiety of trying to make ends meet, now that most of his savings have gone to care home fees, is appalling.\n\nI cannot worry him with these matters and so the entire burden falls upon me. Although the state now contribute to his fees, his whole state pension and half his occupational pension are taken mandatorily towards the fees. One person living in a house does not require half what two people require, because maintaining the house takes a large chunk of the income.\n\nI hope you will reflect on why they chose yet another non-story about Jeremy Corbyn for their front page, rather than the incredibly welcome plans that Labour have to ease the pain and worry currently placed upon the sick and elderly. Aren\u2019t Mr Corbyn\u2019s enemies satisfied yet that they have completely ensured Labour will not get the chance to help people like me, and so many others? I sincerely hope their spiteful campaign fails miserably.\n\nAnonymous\n\nAddress supplied", "description": "I see that the Labour Party feel sufficiently emboldened to concentrate their attack on private education, in any case by removing charitable status, but now they are looking to make total abolishment their policy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/10/eton-college.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
