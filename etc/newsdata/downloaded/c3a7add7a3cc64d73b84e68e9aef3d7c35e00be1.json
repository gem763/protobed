After stuffing a couple of Jones\u2019 takedown attempts, Gibson was able to sprawl, climb onto his back, and rain punches down until the referee stopped the fight less than two minutes into the opening round.\n\nAfter the fight at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn., Gibson said while he\u2019s happy with his performance, expect a more refined version in his next outing.\n\n\u201cI made a statement \u2013 not exactly what I wanted to, but I did my job,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cI went in there, finished the fight quickly, did an awesome job for the fans. Next time, you\u2019re going to see superior striking. You\u2019re going to see something totally different. You\u2019re going to see a whole new MMA athlete coming out.\u201d\n\nBut his focus now lies on his teammate, featherweight champion Julia Budd, who is married to Gibson\u2019s father and coach, Lance Gibson Sr. Budd defends her title againts one of the best female fighters of all time, former Strikeforce, Invicta FC and UFC 145-pound champ Cris Cyborg, in January.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got Julia Budd, the four-time world champion, coming up on Jan. 25 at the Forum (in Los Angeles),\u201d Gibson said. \u201cHer job is to go in and defeat Cyborg and become the five-time world champion, so this is just back-to-back for my camp at Gibson MMA. My dad, Lance Gibson Sr., he\u2019s taught me since I was 2 years old.\u201d\n\nBut Gibson said he\u2019s not interested in sharing the card with Budd. He wants to make sure he\u2019s fully focused on helping her prepare for one the biggest fights of her career. Then he\u2019ll get back to work for himself afterward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s solid, and it\u2019s going to be back and forth,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cJulia\u2019s going to go in, retain her title, and then I\u2019m going to go in shortly after that. I feel great, and have my next fight as well.\u201d", "description": "Lance Gibson Jr. happy with his Bellator 232 first-round finish, but says expect a whole new version next time.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/lance-gibson-jr-bellator-232-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
