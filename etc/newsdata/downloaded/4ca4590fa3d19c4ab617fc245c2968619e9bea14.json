James Gray. Photo: Getty Images and Warner Bros,\n\nFilm buffs could be forgiven for thinking the new Joker movie looks a tad bit familiar: Though director Todd Phillips swears the film is a standalone project, Joker turns out to borrow many key creative elements from an iconic piece of \u201970s pop culture. I\u2019m talking, of course, about the Steve Miller Band\u2019s seminal 1973 single, \u201cThe Joker,\u201d with which the film shares an almost identical title. Official word is that this is just a coincidence, and that unlike the Robby Benson vehicle Ode to Billy Joe, Joker the movie is not a direct screen adaptation of \u201cJoker\u201d the song. However, this hasn\u2019t stopped some eagle-eyed fans from speculating that the two projects may be secretly connected.\n\nDoes this fan theory check out?
