USA TODAY\n\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. \u2013 As he lay on the lush turf last Saturday afternoon, fearing the worst, Kyle Trask wondered: Why now? The Florida quarterback\u2019s knee had twisted. He\u2019d heard a pop. His mind immediately went to what it might mean.\n\n\u201cScary,\u201d Trask calls it now, long after the diagnosis came back \u2013 a sprain \u2013 and after he\u2019d come back into the game to help lead the Gators to a win against Auburn, which is the program\u2019s most significant in years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful the way it turned out,\u201d he says.\n\nHe\u2019s referring to the injury, but the extrapolation fits, too. This weekend, Trask will lead the Gators in an even bigger opportunity, this one on the road against No. 6 LSU. A fourth-year junior, Trask will make his fourth start \u2013 since he was in ninth grade.\n\n\u201cPretty surreal,\u201d Trask says.\n\nFlorida quarterback Kyle Trask throws a pass during the second half against Auburn at Florida Field. (Photo: John Raoux, AP)\n\nBut it\u2019s oh, so real. Which only makes the running joke among his former coaches at Manvel High School near Houston even funnier. They\u2019ve long envisioned a \u201c30 for 30\u201d-style documentary about the guy who played at Florida and then in the NFL and, well, as Larry McRae puts it, laughing:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be the bums that, \u2018Why didn\u2019t he start for his high school?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut there was good reason. Manvel had two superb quarterbacks in the same class. D\u2019Eriq King, a dual-threat dynamo who\u2019s now at Houston, was a better fit for the Mavericks\u2019 offensive system.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nBOWL PROJECTIONS: Ohio State now No. 1 seed for College Football Playoff\n\nRE-RANK: Ohio State takes over as the latest No. 1 in NCAA Re-Rank 1-130\n\nAs King put up big numbers for Manvel, Trask played plenty. The game plan each week had Trask entering the game for the third series.\n\n\u201cWe knew he was a special talented kid, as well,\u201d says McRae, who was Manvel\u2019s offensive coordinator and offensive line coach and is now head coach at Clear Lake High. \u201cThrowing, arm strength and stuff like that, Kyle wasn\u2019t lacking in (talent) at all.\u201d\n\nHe also didn\u2019t lack for other opportunities. To understand how Trask arrived as Florida\u2019s unlikely starter, it\u2019s instructive to know why he stayed at Manvel. Coaches at other high schools saw the big kid with the strong arm. In various ways, they made sure he knew he could start for their team. He says he considered the idea once or twice, but never seriously.\n\nMcRae says word would inevitably come back through the coaching grapevine: Trask had politely declined an opportunity, saying something like, \u201cI\u2019m born and raised in Manvel, Texas, and I\u2019m a Manvel Maverick.\u201d\n\nMelissa Charba, Trask\u2019s mother, recalls only one brief conversation with her son about the possibility of transferring.\n\n\u201cWe just chatted about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not moving for football. Plus, he\u2019s not gonna run from competition just so he can play.\u201d\n\nSays Trask: \u201cMy mom really valued loyalty: \u2018This is where you live. This is where you\u2019re gonna stay and grind it out.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat held true even after high school. Even as quarterbacks transfer with increasing regularity in college football, Trask stayed at Florida. Last summer, with an August graduation date looming for Trask, meaning he\u2019d have the opportunity to transfer with immediate eligibility, Gators coach Dan Mullen met with Trask, curious what he might be thinking.\n\n\u201cHe said he\u2019d support me whatever I did,\u201d Trask recalls. \u201cI told him, \u2018I have no doubts, no thoughts of leaving. I\u2019m all-in.\u2019\u201d\n\nNone of which surprised those who know Trask.\n\n\u201cI knew he wasn\u2019t one of those guys who was gonna run off to the (transfer) portal,\u201d McRae says. \u201cKids go to the portal for different reasons, but I knew Kyle wasn\u2019t gonna run to the portal because of competition.\u201d\n\nNot leaving is one thing. But how he even got to Florida is the oddest part of all of this.\n\nTrask\u2019s big frame and strong arm drew attention from the college coaches who regularly watched Manvel\u2019s practices. Several FCS-level schools offered scholarships. But plenty of those college assistants wondered aloud to Manvel\u2019s coaches: \u201cHow do I tell my head coach we\u2019re gonna offer a scholarship to a kid that\u2019s a backup?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe told \u2018em, \u2018Special circumstances call for special decisions,\u2019\u201d McRae says. \u201c\u2018Trust your eyes. What do you see out of him?\u2019\u201d\n\nDoug Nussmeier, then Florida\u2019s offensive coordinator, saw enough to invite Trask to attend camp in Gainesville the summer before his senior year, and then to a second camp for top recruits. Trask performed well, and got invited to then-coach Jim McElwain\u2019s office when the camp was finished. They weren\u2019t expecting what they got: a scholarship offer.\n\n\u201cWe were blown away,\u201d Charba says. \u201cJust a moment of shock.\u201d\n\nOnce at Florida, a broken right foot derailed his shot in 2017. Last season, it was a broken left foot. And then, after Trask\u2019s conversation with Mullen last summer, Feleipe Franks won the competition to start this season. And at least outside the program, there wasn\u2019t real clarity about which quarterback was No. 2. Emory Jones, a redshirt freshman with tremendous potential, is seen by many as the Gators\u2019 future.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t blink an eye,\u201d Mullen says. \u201cHe stuck and (said), \u2018Coach, this is what I told you I\u2019m doing, this is what I\u2019m doing.\u2019 Now he\u2019s getting his opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe situation wasn\u2019t new to Trask.\n\n\u201cI never settled for being the backup,\u201d he says, referring to both high school and college football. \u201cIt\u2019s something that pushed me every single day. There was always someone competing with me, every day, so I never backed down from the challenge.\u201d\n\nWhen Franks suffered a gruesome ankle injury at Kentucky, in the Gators\u2019 third game, Trask was ready. Since taking over, his completion rate is 71.7 percent. He set a school record with 18 consecutive completions in games against Tennessee and Towson. Perhaps most important, he has provided a steady presence, helping Florida rise to 6-0 and into position for more.\n\n\u201cSo many people have seen his potential,\u201d says Charba, \u201cand he\u2019s been ready. We knew he had it in him. He\u2019s very determined. This isn\u2019t the way you want to become a starter \u2013 our hearts just stopped when we saw Feleipe get hurt \u2013 but (Trask) just continues to steadily work and improve himself. He has such inner drive, continuing to persist and perfect his game.\u201d\n\nMullen says he\u2019s learned Trask is the same competitor he\u2019d seen in practices.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t always know how that\u2019s gonna translate when now they can hit you,\u201d Mullen says. \u201cThe speed of it picks up. I\u2019ve seen him really continue to do what we expected him to do and what we knew he could do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s what those who knew Trask always figured he would do, if opportunity arose. That includes a new role as a team spokesman. Trask handles interviews like a veteran, understated and unemotional, and sees one of his tasks as trying to tamp down the \u201coutside noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat just comes with the success we\u2019re having,\u201d he says. \u201cIn order to keep that success going, we have to stay focused on one goal at a time.\u201d\n\nStill, Trask describes his role in the Gators\u2019 run as \u201creally cool,\u201d and says playing to a packed house at Florida Field \u2013 aka, the Swamp \u2013 is \u201cpretty sweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what we dream about doing when we\u2019re kids,\u201d he says, \u201cplaying in big-time games like this.\u201d", "description": "Kyle Trask didn't start at his Texas high school and rode the bench for his first three seasons at Florida.
