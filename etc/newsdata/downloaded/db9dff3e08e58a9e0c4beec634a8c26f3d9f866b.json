It\u2019s not as good as a knee, a human knee, but it does enough to take some of the impact out of what we are feeling on the ice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese take out some of the slams... so (it\u2019s) absolutely revolutionised what we are doing.\u201d\n\nSwift hopes the new bindings will encourage the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to create a new category for DAKs competitors.\n\n\u201cWith these I am hoping I can shave those three seconds off, and other DAK snowboarders can do the same, and we can get this category ...and get to the next Paralympics in China in 2022.\u201d", "description": "A former British army soldier who lost both his legs in a bomb explosion in Northern Ireland is hoping to snowboard in the 2022 Winter Paralympic Games in China thanks to new 3D-printed bindings which can absorb shock and give him greater speed.", "authors": ["Stuart Mcdill", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
