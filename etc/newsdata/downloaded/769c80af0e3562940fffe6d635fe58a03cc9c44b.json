While the move was widely expected, it triggered a small expansion in FX volatility. surged above 109 to a high of 109.28 before u-turning lower while dropped to 1.1080 and then rebounded above 1.1140. Fed Chairman Powell made it clear that Wednesday\u2019s move was an insurance cut aimed at offsetting the risk of softer global growth and uncertain trade developments. Despite the decision to ease, the and Powell\u2019s comments were laced with optimism. The Fed expects the economy to continue to grow at a moderate rate as they see a strong labor market and consumption. Their worries center on investment and exports but with Brexit and trade risks easing, they \u201cbelieve monetary policy is in a good place.\u201d All of this tells us that the Fed is done for the year and has no intention of lowering rates further. In fact Powell said point blank, \u201cwe\u2019re not thinking about raising rates right now.\u201d Yet the failed to hold onto its gains as Wednesday\u2019s move turned out more positive for risk than for the greenback. This could be tied to Powell\u2019s warning that the General Motors (NYSE: ) strike could cut growth by a couple tenths this quarter or to worries about Apple (NASDAQ: ) . Investors may also be refraining from major positions ahead of Friday\u2019s report. Regardless of the motivation, we don\u2019t expect further cuts from the Fed this year so the dollar should start to trend higher.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Canada set a bottom in with their . The BoC\u2019s decision to leave interest rates unchanged was widely anticipated but instead of emphasizing the strength of the labor market and the positive outlook for the economy, the central bank said the \u201cresilience of Canada\u2019s economy, will be increasingly tested.\u201d They saw the outlook weakening since July with trade conflicts likely to cause business investments and exports to shrink in the second half of the year. Canada is not immune to global developments and could slow below potential in H2. Although they raised their 2019 GDP forecast, they cut their Q3 forecast and lowered their growth projections for 2020 and 2021. According to Governor Poloz, the central bank considered whether the downside risks warranted stimulus, which at this point, they do not. While these cautionary comments drove USD/CAD straight to resistance at the 20-day SMA near 1.3180, we expect further weakness in the loonie, particularly against the , U.S. and dollars. Today\u2019s move should mark the beginning of broader profit taking on long Canadian dollar trades.\n\nThe and dollars traded higher on the back of risk appetite. Data from Australia was also good with price pressures rising slightly in the third quarter. On a quarterly basis, rose 0.5%, which was in line with expectations and this helped to boost to 1.7% from 1.6%. On Monday night, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Lowe said they are prepared to ease policy further if needed but rate cuts are having a \u201cpositive effect\u201d on the economy and we believe that the chance of another move this year is slim. The focus shifts to the New Zealand dollar, which has been an underdog tonight. and numbers are scheduled for release. NZD data has been mostly soft and if this trend continues, we could see hit fresh year-to-date highs.\n\nBoth currencies remain in play tonight with Chinese PMIs scheduled for release. Chile also canceled their APEC summit next month amid unrest and protests. According to President Trump, the time frame for finalizing the deal remains the same. China suggested that President Xi meet with President Trump in Macau and we are still waiting to see if the U.S. agrees. At the same time, the deal is still being negotiated and is in the process of being written and could fall apart at any time. According to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, it will take time for China to \u201cscale up\u201d to the $40 billion to $50 billion in annual agricultural purchases promised by Trump.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Kathy Lien covering: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, USD/CAD.
