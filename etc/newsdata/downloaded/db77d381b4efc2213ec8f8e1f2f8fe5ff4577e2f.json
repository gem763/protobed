Otherwise, the 50 per cent stake had a US$34.9 million book value as at end-June.\n\nThis decision to acquire the rest of PWPL is aligned with POSH's ongoing comprehensive review, the company said in a press statement on Wednesday.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nPOSH chief executive Lee Keng Lin said: \"The prospects for the harbour services sector remain attractive, and we look forward to this next chapter and will work to grow our business both in Singapore and abroad.
