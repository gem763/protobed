There were curiously no MAGA hats. But one woman was wearing a \u201cBlack AF\u201d pin on her gray suit.\n\nIn attendance were some of the hundreds of young black conservatives who came to Washington this past week as a show to liberal America that African Americans can be conservative and support Trump\u2014that the conservative movement is not just for old white men.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe media narrative is that African Americans don\u2019t support the president,\u201d said R.C. Maxwell, a 31-year-old Republican consultant. \u201cWe are happy to demonstrate that there is a larger African-American community that appreciates the job that the president has done.\u201d\n\nThese young people, including Maxwell, had traveled to the capital for the second annual Black Leadership Summit, put on by Turning Point USA, a national conservative, often Trump-aligned campus group. More than 400 people from across the country attended, a Turning Point representative said. And the three-day summit featured 17 speakers, including YouTube stars, pastors, a Breitbart News editor\u2014and an address from the president himself. Speakers pushed a \u201cpull yourself up by the bootstraps\u201d narrative, and panels touched on conservative values like free markets, gun rights and the Bible. Attendees were encouraged to organize as conservatives and go back to their communities as leaders to help change the norm for black voters.\n\n\u201cThis is the herculean effort of the century,\u201d Charlie Kirk, Turning Point\u2018s 25-year-old founder and executive director, said in an interview. \u201cHow can you get black America to think differently ideologically?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s, of course, a tall order. Only 8 percent of black voters identify in some way with the Republican Party, according to a 2018 Pew Research Center survey. And in a recent AP-NORC poll, only 4 percent of black people said they think Trump\u2019s actions have been good for African Americans. Young people, too\u2014more than two-thirds of them, according to a recent Harvard IOP poll of 18- to 29-year-olds\u2014overwhelmingly disapprove of the president.\n\nBut attendees at the summit said they believe Trump\u2014despite the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracies, his \u201cboth sides\u201d comments about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville and his referring to parts of Africa as \u201cshithole countries\u201d\u2014has done more for black America than any other president. To them, accusations of racism against Trump stem from the media, not Trump\u2019s own actions. Many said they admire the president\u2019s personal success and believe he shares their values\u2014in strong families, faith, criminal justice reform, a border wall and opposition to abortion. And they believe fellow black Americans can be convinced of the same.\n\nKirk said the Black Leadership Summit was the brainchild of Candace Owens\u2014Turning Point\u2019s former director of communications. Owens has become a popular, and controversial, figure in her own right, advocating for a \u201cBlexit,\u201d or exit by black Americans from the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cFor decades we have been disrespected by the Democrats. We have empowered their party, lined the pockets of their politicians, and gotten positively nothing in return for our blind allegiance and faithfulness,\u201d Owens said in her introduction for Trump at the White House.\n\nMany attendees said they see the First Step Act, which enacted criminal justice reforms; Trump\u2019s welcoming of Christianity in the White House; his tough stance on immigration; and his tax bill\u2019s creation of \u201copportunity zones,\u201c which encourages investment in cities, as concrete steps the administration has taken to support the black community. They also pointed to the country\u2019s record low black unemployment, which economists say can be attributed to more than Trump\u2019s presidency. (The summit was sponsored by conservatives organizations including Liberty University and The Heritage Foundation.)\n\nOn the matter of race, attendees said they were proud to be rebuffing the political norm for African Americans, and their existence as an anomaly gave an energetic undercurrent to the summit.\n\n\u201cRace should have nothing to do with your choice of thought,\u201d said Kearyn Bolin, 20, the Turning Point president at Texas State University. Bolin stood on Trump\u2019s side while he delivered his speech in the East Room, and she gave her own remarks in support of president. While he shook everyone\u2019s hand on stage, he kissed her on both cheeks and complimented her silver box braids that stretch to her waist. Bolin says people have called her racist for her conservative beliefs, but that helps her empathize with Trump when people call him racist. She also rejects the idea that white people are inherently racist: \u201cIf I am half-white, does that make me half-racist?\u201d\n\nA recent convert to conservatism, Jono Thomas, 26, said the summit offered him a respite from his liberal hometown, Houston, where he is starting a vegan comfort food restaurant. After returning from the White House, Thomas, in a top hat, white dress shirt, gray pinstripe pants and wool scarf, gathered with four other black men and one Latino man in the Capitol Hilton. (Turning Point says it paid for lodging for all attendees between the ages of 15 and 28, and gave scholarship money to more than a quarter of the participants to be able to attend; the price of admission was $10.)\n\nThe young men talked about their political opinions almost as if they were swapping war stories. They bonded over family members who refuse to talk with them and friends who no longer interact with them. Although they agreed on positions like tough immigration laws and abortion restrictions, they said they hadn\u2019t come to the summit for political reasons, so much as to learn how to be better leaders and advocates for their values.\n\nThe men said they support Trump because they think of him as anti-establishment, and that the establishment has repeatedly failed black America. They said they reject what they believe is a \u201cvictim mentality\u201d in the black community and proudly defy the Democratic Party, which they believe takes black America for granted.\n\nThomas said he does not believe systemic racism exists in America. But he does believe bias exists. \u201cRepresentation matters because you have to be able to relate,\u201d he said, when asked about the high mortality rate of black mothers compared with white mothers.\n\nCorey D. Fields, an associate professor of sociology at Georgetown University and author of Black Elephants in the Room: The Unexpected Politics of African-American Republicans, said he believes in the sincerity of the conference\u2019s attendees, but that they do not represent the majority of black Republicans. In his research on African-American Republican activists (who, he notes, are not necessarily reflective of all black Republicans), Fields has found that a majority believe institutional racism affects the black community and want the party to become more diverse. \u201cThe \u2018blame black people types\u2019 were in the minority,\u201d Fields says.\n\nIn its seven years in existence, Turning Point, which says it now has clubs at 1,400 colleges and high schools, has been hounded by associations with white supremacy and has cut ties with several members who seemed to embrace the ideology. In May, the group fired the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, chapter leader after a video surfaced of him flashing the white supremacist \u201cOK\u201d sign, and saying racial slurs and \u201cwhite power.\u201d The group has publicly separated itself from at least three other members in the past year and a half for similar issues.\n\nKirk is quick to distance Turning Point, and Trump, from racism or white supremacy, which he calls a \u201cwicked ideology.\u201d \u201cAnytime I encounter anything adjacent to that I repudiate it,\u201d he says. (Turning Point also hosts a Latino and a women\u2019s leadership conference each year.)\n\nAt their hotel after the Trump speech, attendees pulled out MAGA gear, flags and oversized foam hats while milling around and chatting. One wore a shirt that said, \u201cCandance Owens is better than Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d Some stayed and talked, networking and swapping tips about social media\u2014how to get verified and comebacks to liberal arguments.\n\nAmong the crowd was Joel Patrick (who said he uses a fake last name to protect his family from doxers). musician and entrepreneur from Beavercreek, Ohio, Patrick, 24, has more than 50,000 followers on Twitter, where he calls himself, \u201cTHE LEGENDARY BLACK REDNECK!!!!\u201d He stood out in his cream-colored cowboy hat and American flag-patterned Durango leather cowboy boots. (He had seemed in his element in front of the press at the White House when he laughed at a Guardian reporter\u2019s question about the president\u2019s potential impeachment. \u201cIs that a serious question?\u201d Patrick responded.)\n\nPatrick said he believes the community he is from, outside Dayton, is more focused on \u201cputting food on the table, going to work in the morning, staying healthy, staying fit,\u201d as he put it, rather than the social justice issues and identity politics he attributes to the Democratic Party. Ultimately, he said, \u201cI came to the conference to show that we are not a monolith, that African-American people can support whoever they want.\u201d\n\nAnd for him, that is Trump.", "description": "The president has alienated many African Americans\u2014but not these young activists.", "authors": ["Lj Dawson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/10/e2/af06e08445f1a47b308bcd8a686e/20191006-trump-black-summit-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
