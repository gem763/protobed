EasyJet (LON: ), which was also linked with making a bid for Aigle Azur, fell 3.2%.\n\nThe news threatens a rerun \u2013 albeit on a smaller scale \u2013 of the Air Berlin fiasco two years ago, when Europe\u2019s airlines passed up a golden opportunity to resolve problems of overcapacity in the short-haul segment, and instead carved up the collapsed operator's assets between themselves in an attempt to grab market share.\n\nAs with the Air Berlin episode, there is the suspicion that the government will lean on the local national champion (then, Berlin and Lufthansa; now Paris and Air France-KLM) to come up with some of solution that minimizes job losses.\n\nThe timing of the report is unfortunate, in any case. Air France-KLM published disappointing traffic figures for August earlier, showing the economic slowdown taking a heavy toll on its business.\n\nThe number of the passengers carried by the Franco-Dutch group rose by only 1% from a year earlier. In the first seven months of the year, they\u2019d been up 3.2%. Passenger growth is no longer keeping up with AF-KLM\u2019s capacity growth: available seat-kilometers were up 1.6%. In other words, the group is flying more empty seats across the world \u2013 so, not the best time to be buying more uneconomic capacity, one might think.\n\nReminders of the sector\u2019s recurring problems with overreaching were enough to push Ryanair (LON: ), Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL: ) and Wizz Air (LON: ) down by more than 2% each.\n\nGermany\u2019s Lufthansa was a relative outperformer, losing only 1.9%. That\u2019s despite comments by the head of Germany\u2019s Christian Democrats on Sunday that she supported a new tax on flights in order to reduce carbon emissions. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in an interview with state broadcaster ARD that a levy on flights could be \u201cone way\u201d forward, along with cutting value-added tax on less carbon-intensive rail transport. France already introduced a carbon-related tax on flights earlier this summer, and a rapprochement of policy between the EU\u2019s two biggest countries could pave the way for a pan-European initiative to limit emissions from one sector where they are still growing rapidly.\n\nThe third part of the triple-whammy Monday affected only one company: International Airlines Group (LON: ) fell 1.8% as British Airways pilots began their biggest in over 40 years, in search of higher pay and better working conditions. That news had, however, been mostly priced in.\n\nElsewhere, Europe\u2019s markets were mixed, with the benchmark practically unchanged at 387.24. Italy's led gains, up 0.3% to its highest level since late July. The U.K. was down 0.1% along with the French , while Germany\u2019s was up 0.2%.", "description": "StockBeat: Air-France-KLM Drags Airlines Down on Overcapacity Fears", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB58051_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
