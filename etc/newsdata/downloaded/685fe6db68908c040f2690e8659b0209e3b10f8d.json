Hold them gently and give them a sniff \u2013 you should smell the distinctive aroma of tomato leaf.\n\nThey should be ripe and juicy with none of the bland taste or mealy texture you find in a tomato eaten out of season.\n\nTomatoes are versatile but love other summer harvest vegetables like courgettes and corn and have a natural affinity for herbs like basil, tarragon and chives.\n\nThis upside down cornbread brings together corn, tomatoes and chives for a winning combination.\n\nFlipping it over is the only hold-your-breath moment, but even if bits remain on the bottom of the pan, simply pick them out and place them back on the loaf.\n\nUpside down tomato cornbread\n\n150g unsalted butter, melted\n\n2 tbsp caster sugar\n\n2 tomatoes, about 400g in total\n\n2 eggs, beaten\n\n125g Greek yoghurt\n\n400ml milk\n\n200g polenta\n\n120g plain flour\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n1 tsp baking soda\n\n1 tbsp baking powder\n\n75g sweetcorn kernels\n\n50g grated pecorino cheese or parmesan\n\n10g chives, chopped \u2013 about 3 tbsp\n\nSalt and pepper\n\nPreheat the oven to 175 degrees. Use a 30cm cast-iron frying pan or other ovenproof pan.\n\nSlice the tomatoes, season generously with salt and pepper, and set aside. Reserve three tablespoons of melted butter. Mix the remaining butter, eggs, yoghurt and milk together in a mixing bowl.\n\nIn a separate bowl, sift the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda together. Stir in the polenta. Add the liquid mixture to the dry and stir to combine. Add the sweetcorn, cheese and chives and stir again.\n\nPour the remaining three tablespoons of butter into the frying pan. Brush the sides of the pan with a bit of the butter, add the sugar and cook over medium heat until the sugar is melted. Add the tomatoes, seasoned side down so they cover the bottom of the pan and cook over medium heat for a minute or two.\n\nTake off the stove, then pour the batter evenly over the tomatoes and place the pan in the preheated oven. Bake for about 25 minutes or until the cornbread is nicely browned on top and a skewer inserted in the centre of the loaf comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. The cornbread should have pulled away from the sides but if not, run a palette knife around the edge to ensure it doesn\u2019t stick.\n\nPlace a plate or large chopping board over the pan. Using oven gloves to hold the pan in place, carefully flip over so the tomatoes are on top. If any tomatoes stick to the bottom of the pan, simply scoop them up and place back on the loaf. Slice and serve warm.\n\n@juliapleonard", "description": "Bite into a tomato today and you\u2019re reminded what you miss the rest of the year \u2013 tomatoes that actually taste like tomatoes.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve grown your own, you may be harvesting the end of season mother lode.\u00a0 Turn them into tomato sauce or slow cook them until they\u2019re semi-dried, then store in oil, for a grey autumnal or winter day.
