Of course, who wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they were like basically like, \u2018OK, Mark Ronson identifies himself as sapiosexual, that\u2019s great,'\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd then they proceeded to ask me about Miley Cyrus\u2019 dating life and something else I probably wasn\u2019t that informed to talk about, either, and then that was it.\u201d\n\nMARK RONSON SAYS HE IDENTIFIES AS SAPIOSEXUAL: 'I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS A WORD FOR IT'\n\nFollowing the show, Ronson saw that his comments made headlines. \"It sounds like I went on a TV show to be like, \u2018Guys, I have some big news!\u2019 And the fact that I would go on and sort of declare myself \u2014 like as a heterosexual white male \u2014 part of any marginalized community was terrifying to me, or just embarrassing,\" he said.\n\nHe added that initially, he wasn't worried about his remarks, thinking that they would be put into context.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not what happens on Twitter anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring Ronson's appearance on \"Good Morning Britain,\" host Kate Harraway asked Ronson: \u201cNow we know you are single, and Mark has got very involved in our debate backstage, you are identifying as a man who likes intellect?\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that there was a word for it, but I was really enjoying that segment. We were all arguing in the dressing room with a couple of your producers. And yes, I feel like I identify as sapiosexual,\u201d Ronson replied.\n\nRonson separated from his wife, French actress Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume, in 2017. Their divorce was finalized last year.\n\nThe Grammy award-winning artist is best known for his collaborations with the likes of Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Adele and Bruno Mars.", "description": "In an interview with Rolling Stone on Wednesday, the music producer clarified a comment he made while\u00a0on ITV's \"Good Morning Britain\" last week.", "authors": ["Mariah Haas"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/mark-ronson-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
