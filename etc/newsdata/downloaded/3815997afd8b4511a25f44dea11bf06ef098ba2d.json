Technically, conditions are currently positive and that means that the Brexit news, Larry Kudlow's comments, and earnings news is spun as positive. In a different market environment, all those news events could easily be spun as negatives.\n\nSmall caps - (IWM) - continue to perform very well with a gain of over 1% and there is better action in big-cap technology names that comprise the Nasdaq 100 - (QQQ) . That is indicative of a focus on stock picking and appetite for more speculative trading which is obviously bullish.\n\nThe indices are a little extended now but this is the sort of action that creates our old friend FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). FOMO works particularly well for creating underlying support. All those folks that missed out might be hesitant to chase, but they will be anxious to buy dips rather quickly.\n\nWith a slew of earnings reports on the docket for next week there is going to be some optimism about positive reactions to provide support as well.
