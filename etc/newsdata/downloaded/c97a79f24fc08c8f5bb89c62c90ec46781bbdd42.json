Look in the mirror", "language": "en", "text": "Just 13 percent of Americans, according to a Gallup poll released on Tuesday, pat Congress on the back and say, \u201cGood job!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll thus be disgruntling for many voters to see most of the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives celebrate their re-election come November. Indeed, historical House re-election rates hover around 90 percent, not dropping below 85 percent since at least 1964.\n\nHow can a body so majorly disdained, at least recently, almost assuredly punch its ticket for another two-year term? The answers, political scientists say, are complex. But if you need a simpler reason now, look locally at voters\u2019 perspectives.\n\nFor instance:\n\nIn Maryland\u2019s 8th District, constituent Charles Ray says his representative, Chris Van Hollen, is \u201camong the few, in an institution that seemed to be cowed by a few loud-mouth bullies, who seemed willing to swim against the tide.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile in Illinois\u2019 5th, Isa-Lee Wolf says of Mike Quigley, her House delegate: \u201cMy congressman gets my support because he's swimming upstream in a river with a non-cooperative current.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something to that swimming metaphor. Voters across the country see their House member as a fish out of water \u2014 a heroic figure in a Sisyphean struggle against an evil entity.\n\nIt\u2019s almost Greek in its tragedy.\n\n\u201cThere is something of a paradox in that Congress, as an institution, is deeply unpopular,\u201d Peter Hanson, a University of Denver political science professor who studies polarization, tells Yahoo News. \u201cBut people tend to like and respect their individual member of Congress.\u201d\n\nTo wit, from Facebook:\n\nBlame political homogeny in House districts for the latter: Republicans win conservative districts, and Democrats win liberal ones. No duh, right? Well, it wasn\u2019t always that way. In the mid-20th century, both parties included a healthy number of conservatives and liberals. Hanson notes: \u201cConflicts were not necessarily partisan conflicts. They were ideological. The conflict didn\u2019t spread neatly along party lines.\u201d Today we\u2019re polarized \u2014 but not within our districts \u2014 so it\u2019s harder for Congress to get business done.\n\nGet nothing done? Get poor marks.\n\nVoters elect congressional members, Hanson says, to do a fantastic job representing their districts, not the country. \u201cThe end result of that effort will be gridlock and frustration with Congress on a national level,\u201d he said. More simply: We perceive House politicians as doing their jobs locally but not nationally.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply the design of our system,\u201d Hanson says. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of a legislature to contain a variety of different interests that engage in loud, noisy conflict that, from the outside perspective, looks like nothing but bickering and that frustrates voters.\u201d\n\nHow frustrated are they? To capture the canyon-like gap between individual and institutional approval, Yahoo News this month invited constituents to contrast their House representative with Congress and look toward November\u2019s midterm elections. Why do they like their officials but not those across district boundaries? Will they vote for their representative on Nov. 4?
