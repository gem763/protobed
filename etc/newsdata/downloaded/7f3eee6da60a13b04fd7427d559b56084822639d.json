Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d view of Trump\u2019s behavior, and similar comments by Senator Ben Sasse and Pat Toomey, persuade a handful of House Republicans\u2014many of whom like Texas Will Hurd have already announced their retirements\u2014to vote for impeachment.\n\nSimilar cracks widen in the media; the Drudge Report continues to feature damaging stories about Trump on its front page. At FOX News, the war between the journalists and the advocates intensifies; an attempted \u201cdebate\u201d between Andrew Napolitano and Joseph diGenova turns into chaos, as the principals almost come to blows.\n\nWhen impeachment comes to the Senate, after a contentious House process where there are divides among the Republicans, half a dozen GOP senators vote to convict, leaving Trump in office, but seriously damaged.
