The 7.3 million Bolivians eligible to vote will elect a president and a vice-president, 130 members of the chamber of deputies and 36 senators.\n\nIn order to win in the first round on 20 October, a presidential candidate has to either gain more than 50% of the votes, or 40% with a 10-percentage-point lead over his nearest rival.\n\nIf no candidate reaches that percentage of votes, a second and final round will be held on 15 December in which the first and second placed candidates will run against each other.\n\nWhat are the main issues?\n\nMany of those who took part in anti-government protests in the weeks leading up to the election said they opposed President Morales for two reasons: his environmental policies and his disregard for the result of a referendum held in February 2016.\n\nForest fires which destroyed four million hectares of land in eastern Bolivia made many voters question whether a decree passed by President Morales had contributed to the blazes.\n\nThe decree quadrupled the amount of land farmers are allowed to clear for agricultural production.\n\nMany residents of Santa Cruz province, one of the worst affected by the fires, were also angry at the president for refusing to declare a national emergency over the fires.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Many Bolivians say they are still angry that the results of the 2016 referendum were not respected\n\nBut the placards and signs many of the protesters held aloft also suggested that anger was still running high about the fact that President Morales bypassed the results of the 2016 referendum on term limits.\n\nA majority of Bolivians voted \"no\" to Mr Morales's suggestion to ditch the presidential term limits but Mr Morales's Mas party took the matter to the constitutional court, which ruled in the president's favour, allowing him to stand for a fourth consecutive term.\n\nMany voters say that they have not forgiven President Morales for not sticking to his promise that he would respect the outcome of the referendum.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nHowever, many indigenous Bolivians who were lifted out of poverty during the time Mr Morales was in power continue to back him for president.\n\nThey say Mr Mesa, his main rival, embodies the white Bolivian elite and question his commitment to the poor.\n\nMr Mesa argues that with oil and gas revenue declining, Bolivia needs to be \"more sensible and rational\" in the way it spends its money, especially as the country has a fiscal deficit of 7.8% of GDP.\n\nBut his message of curtailing spending has not proven popular with poor voters who have seen steady improvements to their quality of life under President Morales.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption \u00d3scar Ortiz says he stands for a new generation of Bolivians\n\nMr Ortiz, meanwhile, has asked voters to ignore the opinion polls which have him trailing way behind Mr Morales and Mr Mesa.\n\nAt his closing rally, he urged his supporters to cast their vote not for \"the old Bolivia\" which he claims Mr Mesa and Mr Morales stand for, but for \"the Bolivian youth which will guarantee that Bolivia does not return to the past\".", "description": "After almost 14 continuous years in office will Evo Morales get an unprecedented fourth term?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CA5C/production/_109240815_15b04f12-3f4e-4933-8ca2-5d59602adcc5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
