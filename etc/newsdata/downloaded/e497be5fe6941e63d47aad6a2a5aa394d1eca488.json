LB. Twarog\n\nJohn Lewis and the cycle of racism in the United States\n\n\u201cThis is the true story of how civil rights were carved out in America: in the blood of activists.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda March, by John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, and Nate Powell\n\nThe golden era of protest music\n\n\u201cProtest songs make people feel not alone \u2026 This is where I think preaching to the converted is underrated. It\u2019s fine to cement beliefs to inspire people to act on them.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda 33 Revolutions per Minute: A History of Protest Songs, by Dorian Lynskey\n\nThe Reference Desk\n\n(New York Public Library)\n\nThis week\u2019s question is from S.J., who\u2019s in search of literary fiction that\u2019s perfect for fall and winter reading.\n\nWhile Autumn, by Ali Smith, might sound like an obvious answer, it\u2019s timely in more ways than just the title\u2014the novel is an intricately structured, richly imagined response to Brexit, a process that\u2019s currently reaching a crisis point in the United Kingdom. If you\u2019re more in the market for an escape from dreary news and weather, though, you might try exploring the fantastical worlds of Terry Pratchett or J. R. R. Tolkien (including the latter\u2019s lesser-known short story that sums up his writing philosophy). Between those two poles, the eerie novels of Shirley Jackson use supernatural themes to uncover dark realities about society and psychology.\n\nThe colder months can be a good time to settle down with a classic you\u2019ve always meant to get to: Meet the vivid, complex characters of Anna Karenina, or reap the still-relevant insights of The Grapes of Wrath. I\u2019m personally fond of Persuasion, which, taking place primarily in the fall and winter, has a bittersweet autumnal flavor of nostalgia and regret\u2014but eventually promises a fresh start for its central characters.\n\nWrite to the Books Briefing team at booksbriefing@theatlantic.com or reply directly to this email with any of your reading-related dilemmas.
