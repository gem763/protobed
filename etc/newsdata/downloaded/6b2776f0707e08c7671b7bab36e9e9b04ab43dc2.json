An unexpected break below here kills the buy signal targeting 1.0950/40 and 1.0905/00 before the swing low at 1.0883/77.\n\nholding above 1.3210 meets first resistance at 1.3230/40 but a break higher today meets a selling opportunity at 1.3270/80, with stops above 1.3300.\n\nA break below 1.3190 retests last week's low at 1.3166. A break lower retests the September low at 1.3133/29 & below here targets 1.3105/00.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Jason Sen covering: EUR/USD, USD/CAD.
