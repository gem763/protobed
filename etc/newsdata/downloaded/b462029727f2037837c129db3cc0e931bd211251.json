In a statement, he said that \u201cat no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019. I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.\u201d\n\nThe White House also disputed the account. \u201cThis is actually not true,\u201d White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a tweet.\n\nAfter these statements were issued, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said, \u201cWe stand by the story.\u201d\n\nThe current and former officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it would assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint, which centers on a call that Trump made with the leader of Ukraine in late July.\n\nSome Senate Republicans stunned, question White House\u2019s judgement after release\n\nMaguire has been caught in the middle of a fight between Congress and the executive branch over the contents of the whistleblower report since it reached his office late last month.\n\nHe has at times expressed his displeasure to White House counsel Pat Cipollone and others that the White House had put him in the untenable position of denying the material to Congress over a claim that it did not fall within his jurisdiction as leader of the intelligence community.\n\nThe contents of Trump\u2019s call were released by the White House on Wednesday, showing that Trump repeatedly pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue investigations that might yield political dirt against Trump\u2019s adversaries, including former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nMaguire became DNI last month after the resignation of previous director Daniel Coats and Trump\u2019s refusal to allow the deputy director, Sue Gordon, to step into the senior job.\n\nSince the whistleblower controversy erupted earlier this month, Maguire has been the target of harsh criticism from Democratic lawmakers who accuse him of blocking the complaint from being transmitted to Congress.\n\nIt was unclear whether Maguire\u2019s threat had forced the White House to acquiesce and allow him to testify without constraint. But officials said Maguire has pursued the opportunity to meet with lawmakers to defend his actions and integrity.\n\nIn a statement issued Tuesday evening, Maguire said, \u201cIn light of recent reporting on the whistleblower complaint, I want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am committed to protecting whistleblowers and ensuring every complaint is handled appropriately,\u201d Maguire added. \u201cI look forward to continuing to work with the Administration and Congress to find a resolution regarding this important matter.\u201d", "description": "Joseph Maguire feared the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall when he provides testimony on Thursday.", "authors": ["Greg Miller", "National Security", "Intelligence", "Shane Harris", "National Security Reporter", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7sXnDqXpTzH33-TBNATCo7M-_is=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FK64F2G7YQI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
