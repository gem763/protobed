She has stymied the president\u2019s obsession to build a wall on the Mexican border and most recently challenged his desire to act to enhance the interests of Putin in Ukraine and in Syria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast week, Pelosi challenged the lion in his own den. You have to give her credit. It wouldn\u2019t be easy for even the most hardened politician to walk into the White House, as Pelosi did, stand up to the president, stare him down and tell him to his face that he\u2019s Putin\u2019s puppet.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi was slow to start the impeachment inquiry into the president. But since she initiated the process, there has been a significant upsurge in support for the president's impeachment and removal from office. A new Gallup poll indicated that a majority (52 percent) of Americans now supports Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal. In June, a majority (53 percent) opposed impeachment.\n\nWarren in the last few weeks has emerged as the biggest threat to former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Warren to protest with striking Chicago teachers Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE\u2019s campaign to secure the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nShe has run a smooth, steady and mostly mistake-free campaign. In the most recent debate, she had more screen time than any of the other candidates and calmly handled all the flak that came her way during the discussion.\n\nThe Real Clear Politics average of national polls of Democratic primary voters reveals that Warren is within striking distance of the frontrunner, Biden, and that she has lapped Sanders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWarren\u2019s surge in the polls has come at the expense of Sanders. National polls show Warren leading Sanders among the liberal Democrats who fueled Sanders' 2016 campaign.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez\u2019 formal endorsement of Sanders on Saturday was a much-needed burst of energy for the Vermont senator\u2019s sagging presidential fortunes.\n\nEven though she is a new member and only 30 years old, Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) has had an outsized influence on national politics in her brief time in Congress. She joins Reps.

Two thirds (65 percent) of the Warren supporters have a favorable opinion of AOC, which means she might be a vehicle to bring former followers of Sanders back into the fold.\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that three women have become the driving force behind the effort to unseat the president. Trump has accelerated women\u2019s move from the Democratic to the Republican Party.\n\nThe president\u2019s many demeaning statements about women and his appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughMajority disapprove of Trump Supreme Court nominations, says poll These 3 women are defining the race to unseat Trump On The Money: Supreme Court takes up challenge to CFPB | Warren's surge brings scrutiny to wealth tax | Senators eye curbs on Trump emergency powers MORE to the Supreme Court in the face of credible accusations against the jurist of sexual assault have no doubt made many Republican women rethink their party affiliation.\n\nMidterm election exit polls indicated that Democrats made significant gains among female voters and that these gains were the reason Democrats reclaimed the House majority.\n\nIn August a national poll found that women opposed the president's reelection by a two-to-one margin. Sixty-two percent of all female registered voters said they would vote for a generic Democratic presidential candidate, while only 30 percent said they would vote for Trump.\n\nThe end of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency could be the beginning of a new era of female dominance in American government. These three women have lots of clout now, and they might have even more after Election Day next year.\n\nBrad Bannon is a Democratic pollster and CEO of Bannon Communications Research.
