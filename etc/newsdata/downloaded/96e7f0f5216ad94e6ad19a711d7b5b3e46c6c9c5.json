Get Me Out of Here! in 2008, praised Boris Johnson, backed Brexit and did not rule out standing as an MP himself.\n\n'I'm very pro-Brexit,' he told the Daily Express. 'I like helping people, the Conservative Party has the values I share, and I wanted to engage with something real.'\n\nDavid Van Day pictured with Conservative MP for Chelmsford Vicky Ford in March\n\nWhen asked if he would consider standing, he said 'It's not out of the question.'\n\nMr Van Day, an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, said that he was not always as interested in politics, revealing that in his showbiz heyday he was 'just interested in partying, sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll'.\n\nSpeaking of Boris Johnson's love life, he said the Prime Minister had a 'naughty glance in his eye' - but praised his conference speech, saying there were a lot of jokes but he 'means business'.\n\nJoking about what he would do if he were Prime Minister, Mr Van Day said he would ensure letterboxes are placed in the middle of the door, not at the bottom, because the lower ones cause 'back strain' while out canvassing.\n\nHe added that he would lower taxes and encourage entrepreneurs.\n\nMr Van Day had a fall from grace when he declared himself bankrupt and was reduced to selling fast food in Brighton, a career move which earned him the nickname Burger Van Day\n\nAfter starting out as a vocalist in pop band Guys 'n' Dolls, Van Day, from South Ockendon, Essex, shot to fame as one half of the band Dollar (pictured: David Van Day and Thereza Bazar on 'Starburst' in 1982)\n\nMr Van Day was elected as a local councillor in the Aveley and Upland ward on Thurrock Council in March, taking the seat formerly held by independent Tim Aker.\n\nHe had previously unsuccessfully stood in local elections in Brighton in 2007.\n\nAfter starting out as a vocalist in pop band Guys 'n' Dolls, Van Day, from South Ockendon, Essex, shot to fame as one half of the band Dollar.\n\nDuring his heyday, Van Day threw himself into the high-octane celebrity life and reportedly blew \u00a3100,000 on cocaine.\n\nBut he had a spectacular fall from grace when he declared himself bankrupt in 2014 and was reduced to selling fast food in Brighton, a career move which earned him the nickname Burger Van Day.\n\nHe later re-invented himself from pop has-been to 'reality TV personality' - the highlight of which was a stint in the I'm A Celebrity jungle in 2008.\n\nHe claims to have slept with more than 1,000 women. For several years he was in a relationship with the other half of Dollar, Thereza Bazar.", "description": "David Van Day (pictured with MP Vicky Ford),\u00a0has reinvented himself as a councillor in Thurrock, Essex.
