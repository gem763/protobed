During his performance at the city\u2019s Moda Center on Monday night (30 September), a woman held up two signs. One depicted the logo of the anti-Islam party For Britain struck through by a red line. The other read: \u201cBigmouth indeed.\u201d\n\nIn fan footage from the concert, Morrissey can be seen addressing the woman after the second song of the night. \u201cLet\u2019s be quite frank,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you with the sign are removed, I will continue.\u201d His fans then join in as he repeatedly shouts \u201cgo\u201d, \u201cwe don\u2019t need you\u201d and \u201cgoodbye\u201d, calling upon his lighting technician to bring up the house lights.\n\nThe protester left, and Morrissey performed Hairdresser on Fire from his 1988 single Suedehead. The Guardian has contacted representatives for Morrissey for comment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Morrissey ejects a protester from a concert in Portland, 30 September 2019 \u2013 video\n\nIn May, Morrissey wore a For Britain badge during a performance on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In June, he reaffirmed his support for the party in an interview with his nephew, published on his own website.\n\n\u201cThe UK is a dangerously hateful place now, and I think we need someone to put a stop to the lunacy and to speak for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI see [For Britain leader] Anne Marie Waters as this person. She is extremely intelligent, ferociously dedicated to this country, she is very engaging and also very funny at times.\u201d\n\nHis support for the party led Cardiff\u2019s Spillers, the world\u2019s oldest record shop, to ban his records from sale. Mersey Rail also banned Morrissey promotional posters, saying that they did not \u201cmeet the organisation\u2019s values\u201d. Morrissey responded: \u201cIt\u2019s very Third Reich, isn\u2019t it? And it proves how only the feelings of the most narrow-minded can be considered within the British arts.\u201d\n\nBigmouth strikes again and again: why Morrissey fans feel so betrayed Read more\n\nIn July, Billy Bragg said it was \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d that Morrissey was spreading far-right ideas after the singer shared a YouTube video that argued that the British establishment was using Stormzy to promote multiculturalism at the expense of white culture. Bragg also criticised the Killers frontman Brandon Flowers for describing Morrissey as \u201cstill a king\u201d.\n\nMorrissey\u2019s ongoing US tour, featuring support from alt-rock band Interpol, has been plagued by poor ticket sales. Fans reported that two-thirds of the Moda Center was curtained off. A subsequent date in Seattle on Tuesday (1 October) was cancelled. The promoter\u2019s website said that the cancellation was \u201cdue to circumstances beyond our control\u201d.\n\nIn a post on Morrissey Central, the 60-year-old singer described the atmosphere on the tour as \u201cfantastic \u2026 and full of hope \u2026 at an urgent time when most modern music cannot provide one genuine insight.\u201d The tour is due to resume in San Francisco tomorrow (3 October).", "description": "The protester held two signs, one condemning anti-Islam party For Britain, and another that said \u2018Bigmouth indeed\u2019", "authors": ["Laura Snapes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e83d1658af4d453d9c5bc8ab391f079e1130f0ba/0_233_2368_1420/master/2368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e32f3f8b487c8a140693dbc67f6da8ba"}
