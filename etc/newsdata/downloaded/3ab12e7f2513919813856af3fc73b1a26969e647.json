Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $2.45 a share. A year earlier, the bank reported a profit of $8.38 billion, or $2.34 per share.\n\nRevenue rose 8% to $29.34 billion from $27.26 billion a year ago, above analysts' expectations for $28.47 billion.\n\nThe bank has now posted year-over-year profit gains for each of the past seven quarters, boosted by rising interest rates that had increased the profitability on lending operations. But rate expectations reversed this summer as the Federal Reserve moved from increasing its base rate to cutting rates. JPMorgan's interest expense was up 25% from a year ago.\n\nEven so, the bank's net interest income, the amount it makes from lending minus the interest it pays out, rose 2% to $14.23 billion.\n\nJPMorgan shares rallied in September, closing above $120 for the first time in its history. It is up 19% this year, more than the KBW Nasdaq bank index and slightly above the S&P 500. Shares rose 1.8% to $118.66 in premarket trading Tuesday.\n\nRevenue from non-lending operations at the bank jumped 13% to $15.11 billion.\n\nIn the bank's consumer unit, revenue rose 7% to $14.26 billion and in the corporate and investment bank it rose 6% to $9.34 billion.\n\nThe consumer bank has remained resilient in the face of a potential economic slowdown, and executives have touted the strength of the U.S. consumer compared with big corporate clients. It said deposit balances and consumer lending revenue increased, allowing it to expand margins in the business.\n\nProfit for JPMorgan's consumer bank rose 5% to $4.27 billion as income from mortgage fees surged thanks to refinancing activities. The bank charged off 1.16% of its consumer loans.\n\nIn the corporate and investment bank, profit rose 7% to $2.81 billion. Revenue from the banking side, which includes advisory and treasury work, rose 2% while its trading revenue rose 14%. The bank's fixed-income revenue was up 25%, a surge it said came despite deteriorating markets, as it seeks to take market share in that business.\n\nJPMorgan's two smaller business lines both slipped in the quarter. The commercial bank earned $937 million, down 14%, while its asset management operations earned $668 million, down 8%\n\nReturn on equity, a key measure of profitability, was 15% in the third quarter, compared with 14% a year ago. Total expenses rose 5% to $16.42 billion\n\nWrite to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 15, 2019 07:50 ET (11:50 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
