The first silver coin was announced last November.\n\nIt is due to be released in a run limited to 50,000 coins.\n\nMboweni simultaneously finalised the design for the 2020 edition of the fine-silver R2 Kruger Rand, which sticks to the standard look of the Kruger coins.\n\nIn a related update, the Reserve Bank announced a small change to an upcoming series of coins featuring a leopard \u2013 which will now be considerably less angry.\n\nIn March Mboweni gazetted the designs for a \"Big 5\" series of coins in gold, silver, and platinum, with designs featuring leopards and rhinos due to be issued on 1 January 2020.\n\nThe leopard coin featured an animal with its ears pulled back sharply.\n\nBut the design had been adjusted, the Reserve Bank said on Friday \u2013 to one with a leopard that seems less likely to pounce on prey.\n\n(Compiled by Phillip de Wet)\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The new 2020 Natura collectable silver coin will feature the Coelophysis rhodesiensis dinosaur.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9466/5d84d65ee0b14481879ab685a22fc59d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
