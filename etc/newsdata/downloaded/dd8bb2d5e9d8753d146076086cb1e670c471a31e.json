(NOAA)\n\nClimate change is reshaping the evolution and intensity of El Ni\u00f1o events in a way that favors the occurrence of more \u201csuper\u201d El Ni\u00f1os, according to a study published Monday. The study examines 33 El Ni\u00f1o events from 1901 through 2017, and concludes that since the late 1970s, there has been a westward shift by up to thousands of miles in where in the Pacific Ocean El Ni\u00f1o is originating and peaking in intensity, as well as a boost in the odds of extremely strong El Ni\u00f1o events.\n\nThe westward move is significant, since it means El Ni\u00f1o is now forming and peaking in a region of the Pacific Ocean that is naturally warmer. This can increase the chances of a moderate to strong event.\n\nThe multinational team of researchers found that climate change is disproportionately warming the waters of the western tropical Pacific Ocean relative to the Central Pacific. This is influencing trade winds, which tend to blow more strongly from cooler to warmer waters. The warming trend is also leading to more frequent Central Pacific-based El Ni\u00f1os and for intense El Ni\u00f1o events to first ripple outward from the Western Pacific.\n\nAll 11 El Ni\u00f1os that have taken place since 1978 formed in the Central or Western Pacific Ocean, according to the study, including three super El Ni\u00f1os that helped push global temperatures to record levels and wreaked havoc with weather patterns worldwide.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is a periodic warming of ocean waters along with shifts in trade winds and precipitation patterns in the equatorial tropical Pacific Ocean. By adding tremendous amounts of heat to the ocean\u2019s surface and the atmosphere, El Ni\u00f1o events can alter weather patterns worldwide. This is especially true for the United States during the winter, when California can be pounded by a relentless series of storms.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o\u2019s fingerprints can be found from Africa to Asia and even Australia, where it can lead to precipitation extremes.\n\n\n\nFigure from Wang et al., showing the evolution of El Ni\u00f1o events from 1901 to 2017. (Bin Wang)\n\nSuper El Ni\u00f1os, like the ones that occurred in 1982, 1998, and 2015-2016, can vault global temperatures to new heights, killing coral reefs worldwide and flooding parts of Africa and Asia while starving other parts of the globe of moisture. In short, they can lead to lasting extreme weather events affecting hundreds of millions and costing billions of dollars in damage.\n\nHow El Ni\u00f1o will change in a warming world has been an elusive but important question for researchers, and there remain many uncertainties. However, the new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses statistical methods as well as eight different computer models to uncover previously unseen trends in El Ni\u00f1o occurrences to date. The study finds the key may lie in the increasingly mild ocean waters of the western tropical Pacific Ocean \u2014 an area known as the West Pacific Warm Pool.\n\nThe West Pacific warming, the study\u2019s authors propose, is altering trade winds across the equatorial tropical Pacific, triggering El Ni\u00f1o events that propagate from west to east with time.\n\n\u201cI think the main point [of the study] is that El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s onset processes has been changed since the 1970s,\u201d said lead author Bin Wang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Hawaii, in an interview.\n\nOne difference between the western Pacific El Ni\u00f1os and eastern Pacific events, Wang says, is that the western-based events can begin to affect global weather patterns during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, rather than reserving the most significant impacts for the winter months. This can lead to long-lasting drought and heat waves in the Western United States, for example.\n\nThe new study comes as scientists are seeking new ways of understanding and predicting climate variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean. \u201cI think this is a major message ... what determines the future change in El Ni\u00f1o intensity is the temperature change in the West Pacific relative to Central Pacific,\u201d Wang said.\n\nStudy co-author Mark Cane of Columbia University, who is a pioneer in El Ni\u00f1o forecasting, says computer models have failed to accurately simulate changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean during the past few decades.\n\nHe says if the West Pacific heats up faster than the East Pacific, it\u2019ll cause more El Ni\u00f1o events to be centered toward the international date line, rather than farther east.", "description": "A new study finds that El Ni\u00f1o has been fundamentally changing since the 1970s.", "authors": ["Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "October At Pm", "Andrew Freedman Edits", "Reports On Weather", "Extreme Weather", "Climate Science For Capital Weather Gang.
