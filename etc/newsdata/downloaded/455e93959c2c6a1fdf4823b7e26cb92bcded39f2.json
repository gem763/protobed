Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, Daum writes that although she found Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations of sexual assault \u201cmoving, compelling and entirely credible,\u201d she was \u201cless moved by the sloganeering that rose up around them.\u201d The \u201cBelieve Survivors\u201d trope, she argues, draws no distinction between violent rape and lesser forms of male creepiness (groping, leering), and sacrifices due process for the accused to outraged assertions of male sinfulness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDaum is hardly the first to complain about the excesses of the \u201cwokescenti,\u201d to use her term, and she admits that her own irritation at \u201cthe smug vibe of many young activists\u201d may be partly middle-aged angst. Born in 1970, Daum describes herself as a classic \u201cGen Xer,\u201d raised to believe in the value of \u201ctoughness\u201d: Those entering adulthood should expect \u201cto get tossed around a bit,\u201d she writes. Gen Xers \u201cregistered opinions without being smacked down on social media moments later. We made mistakes in private and, in turn, respected the privacy of others in their mistakes,\u201d she points out. \u201cThe same cannot be said for the relationship between my generation and those that are coming up behind us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Problem with Everything\u201d offers plenty of Daum\u2019s trademark zingers, on topics like trendy T-shirts bearing feminist slogans \u2014 \u201cnarcissism repackaged as revolution\u201d \u2014 and the pornography-fueled millennial obsession with eliminating body hair (\u201chardly an evolutionary advantage; if the cavemen had been sticklers for the shaved look, we would all have died out twenty-thousand years ago.\u201d) But Daum\u2019s book is messy; it meanders from topic to topic, and one-liners often stand in for real analysis. Daum spends little time contemplating the kinds of exclusion, injustice and pain that may lie behind the millennial intolerance she decries, and she offers no way forward beyond urging \u201cempathy\u201d for those \u201cgrappling with the confusions of their own doctrines.\u201d\n\nToo often the book gets bogged down in the same kind of narcissistic palaver Daum derides. \u201cI never much believed that the personal is political,\u201d she declares, because \u201clet\u2019s face it, more often than not the personal is just personal. In my case, the personal wasn\u2019t unique or even necessarily all that interesting.\u201d Nevertheless, she goes on to describe, at some length, her childhood, her young adult forays into New York\u2019s media world, her evolution from would-be fiction writer to essayist, her divorce and her growing obsession with aging.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much Gen X toughness on display here, and Daum\u2019s detours into bildungsroman don\u2019t enhance her critique of the modern left. She dwells on her many hours spent alone in her New York apartment \u201ctrying to beat back migraines, fantasizing about sex with strangers while exhaustively reading comments on Talking Points Memo.\u201d\n\nEventually, Daum stumbles across Free Speech YouTube, where she finds some kindred spirits: John McWhorter, Glenn Loury, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jordan Peterson, even Camille Paglia. She is \u201cinvigorated, even electrified\u201d by their willingness to ask un-PC questions: \u201cAre we using multiculturalism as a cover for tolerating human rights abuses in other countries? . . . Are there biological sex differences that help explain the gender wage gap?\u201d Daum \u201clapped it all up. I couldn\u2019t get enough. These videos felt like a safety net, even a warm embrace. . . . I was going a little crazy.\u201d Saint Paul on the road to Damascus? Probably not.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI hesitate to characterize this as a midlife crisis,\u201d Daum writes, for \u201cthat seems too generic.\u201d But, of course, it\u2019s exactly that generic. Daum isn\u2019t wrong to worry about the ways in which \u201csocial-justice activism [is] eating itself,\u201d but her book ultimately devolves into a chronicle of navel-gazing \u2014 the kind that can only be experienced by those with a bit too much time on their hands, and a bit too much (dare I say) \u201cprivilege.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s particularly hard to know what to make of \u201cThe Problem with Everything,\u201d because Daum ultimately seems to disavow part of her own argument. Attending her college reunion, she is moved to reflect on \u201cthe passing of time,\u201d which \u201chad yanked some of our certainty out from underneath us.\u201d Tomorrow, she notes, with some satisfaction, \u201cthe young people now nipping at my heels will be walking the brick paths at their own school reunions, feeling some combination of embarrassment and pride at how they used to be.\u201d And perhaps, she muses, \u201cthe problem with everything isn\u2019t meant to be solved. It\u2019s meant to feed us . . . it\u2019s meant to invite our smartest selves to join hands with our stupidest selves and see where the other leads us.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be human is to be confused,\u201d Daum opines \u2014 but a bit more clarity would have been welcome in what could have been a truly audacious cultural critique.\n\nRosa Brooks is a professor at Georgetown University Law Center and author of \u201cHow Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything.\u201d\n\nAt 7 p.m. on Nov. 6, Meghan Daum will be in conversation with Kyra Phillips at Politics and Prose at Union Market, 1270 Fifth St. NE.\n\nTHE PROBLEM WITH EVERYTHING\n\nMy Journey Through the New Culture Wars\n\nBy Meghan Daum\n\nGallery. 256 pp. $27\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cThe Problem With Everything\u201d is a gutsy but flawed book.", "authors": ["Rosa Brooks"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6Edhtn1gwSF7j259ySQMppiDlIM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GGVR7QXVCAI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
