The panel, titled \u201cBig Data Meets Artificial Intelligence: A Perfect Storm for Financial Markets, Supervisors, and Sustainable Development?\u201d included senior experts from various international organizations.\n\n\n\nCecilia Scharp, Assistant Director-General at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) provided brief opening remarks underscoring the importance of this topic, and Tobias Adrian, Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the IMF gave the keynote address to set the stage for the discussion.\n\nIn his introductory remarks, Babak Abbaszadeh, CEO, Toronto Centre, mentioned that \u201csupervisors must strike a balance between mitigating risks to financial stability while promoting innovation and protecting consumers.\u201d\n\nAditya Narain, Deputy Director MCM and Board Member at Toronto Centre moderated the panel discussion. The panel discussion featured commentary on the potential impacts of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) on financial markets, market players, and financial supervisory authorities. The debate focused on whether big data and AI\u2019s introduction would facilitate positive development or result in unwelcome consequences. Lisa Davis, Managing Director of Treasury and Trade Solutions with Citigroup noted the need for reform in the new age of big data, \u201cif data is truly the new oil, it must first be properly extracted, refined, digitized and governed in order for it to reach its full potential.\u201d\n\nThe industry experts considered the future of legal issues relating to privacy and data protection, consumer protection, and cross-border disputes. Greg Medcraft, Director of the Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) commented on emerging issues, stating \u201ccitizens\u2019 ability to hold and control their own personal data has to be the future if we want AI and data-driven finance that is truly inclusive and works for the consumer.\u201d\n\nCurtis Ravenel, Global Head of Sustainable Business and Finance at Bloomberg and a member of the Secretariat for the Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures highlighted the need for companies to disclose information, \"in an age of hyper transparency, the question for companies is whether or not they want to own their narrative. If they chose not to disclose, Big Data and AI will construct one for them.\"\n\nThe panelists reflected upon the opportunities that big data and AI present for achieving the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and considered what the added value is of leveraging big data for the SDGs. Socorro Heysen, Superintendent at Peru's Banking, Insurance, and Private Pension Funds Authority touched on SDGs pertaining to gender equality, inequality, and inclusiveness with her comments, \u201cnew technologies are great news for financial inclusion, but we should protect the user from bad business conduct, in particular, practices like aggressive sales, predatory credit, profiling or personal data breaches.\u201d\n\nPanelists included:\n\nGreg Medcraft (OECD)\n\nSocorro Heysen (Peru's Banking, Insurance, and Private Pension Funds Authority)\n\nCurtis Ravenel (Bloomberg)\n\nLisa Davis (Citigroup)\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nwww.torontocentre.org\n\nEstablished in 1998, Toronto Centre for Global Leadership in Financial Supervision (Toronto Centre) is an independent not-for-profit organization that promotes financial stability and access to financial services globally.
