That\u2019s an average 13.5 untruths per 24 hours.\n\nTrump hit the 10,000 lies milestone in April.\n\nHe passed the 12,000 lies mark in August, when he was spouting an average 12.9 lies per day.\n\nThe Post put the recent uptick down to revelations of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the subsequent launch of an impeachment investigation into the U.S. president.\n\nAround one-fifth of Trump\u2019s total lies have centered on immigration, reported the newspaper.\n\nOther hot topics that the president has repeatedly spread disinformation about include trade, the state of the U.S. economy and former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible Trump campaign collusion.", "description": "The pace of the president's false claims is accelerating.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da566ed210000570facdd65.jpeg?cache=imaewsw4g4&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
