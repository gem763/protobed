He then asked for the release of all female prisoners held in Egypt, and also to have contact with his Cypriot ex-wife.\n\nHe surrendered to Cypriot authorities about six hours after he landed, having gradually released all passengers and crew unharmed.\n\nThe Cypriot authorities handed him over to Cairo after a court ruling cleared the way for his extradition.\n\nCypriot courts had heard appeals since 2016 against the extradition of the 61-year-old to Cairo, rejecting his arguments that he would not receive a fair trial in Egypt.", "description": "An Egyptian court on Tuesday handed a life sentence to an Egyptian man who hijacked an airliner to Cyprus in 2016 using a fake explosive belt.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
