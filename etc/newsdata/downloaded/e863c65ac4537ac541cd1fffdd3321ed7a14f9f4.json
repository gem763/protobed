I have not brought any names up,\u201d Elway said Friday to reporters at an event outside Denver\u2019s stadium honoring Hall of Fame inductees Champ Bailey and Pat Bowlen , along with some of the team\u2019s all-time top 100 players, which included Elway and Manning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to win football games,\u201d Elway said. \u201cSo, no one from our side is on the trading block. We\u2019re going to try to continue to win football games.\u201d\n\nElway said he\u2019s frustrated that it\u2019s taken so long to turn around Denver\u2019s dive and reiterated a point he made this summer to The Associated Pres that his job isn\u2019t enjoyable right now - but he stressed he has no plans to walk away before fixing the team he led to two Super Bowl titles as a Hall of Fame quarterback and another as a front-office executive.\n\n\u201cI think the hardest thing about losing is you get in a situation to where something bad happens in a game and you say, \u2018Here we go again,\u2019 and that is a very tough thing to break,\u201d Elway said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to get out of. I think it\u2019s hurt us a couple of times. But we went out and got one last week and so we\u2019ve got to continue to stay positive with it and work our way through it.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos, who host Tennessee (2-3) on Sunday, lost their first four games under Fangio, including two home games on last-second field goals, before snapping an eight-game overall skid with a 20-13 road win over the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.\n\nElway said he\u2019s committed to staying on and fulfilling his contract; he\u2019s about halfway through a five-year extension signed in July 2017.\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t like to lose,\u201d Elway said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not enjoyable. But all we can do is continue to work. Not a whole lot we can do now except try to play better.\u201d\n\nBeyond safety Kareem Jackson, Elway\u2019s 2018 free agent class has been a bust so far. Cornerback Bryce Callahan (foot) and receiving running back Theo Riddick (shoulder) haven\u2019t played and right tackle Ja\u2019Wuan James (knee) has played just 10 snaps.\n\nCallahan\u2019s absence has hurt the most, forcing Fangio to shuffle his secondary. He recently had another procedure on his surgically repaired left foot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating for everybody this year, including him,\u201d Elway said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the last thing goes and see if he\u2019ll be able to get back this year or not. We\u2019re hopeful, but we really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nElway said he likes the way Fangio has handled the tough times, saying, \u201che\u2019s been a pillar,\u201d and he sees Flacco and first-time offensive coordinator Rich Scangarello are \u201cgrowing together and getting more comfortable with each other.\u201d\n\nElway said he hasn\u2019t made any decision on which of his sidelined players will come off injured reserve. One of those is rookie quarterback Drew Lock, who sprained the throwing thumb on his right hand in the preseason and is eligible to return to practice next week.\n\nAlso receiving an endorsement from Elway was Miller, who has just two sacks so far and lost pass-rush partner Bradley Chubb to a season-ending knee injury two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating for Von, he gets a lot of attention,\u201d Elway said. \u201cBut I think he\u2019ll keep working at it, stay after it. He\u2019s still the same player he always has been. \u2026 But you know, you lose a player like Chubb on the other side, it\u2019s not going to help Von.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Elway says that despite Denver's 1-4 start, none of his veteran players are on the trading block and the general manager remains committed to seeing his beloved Broncos out of their prolonged plummet.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/broncos_elway_football_09536_c0-228-5472-3420_s1200x700.jpg?f89739662670662341638fe34403095f75f3e118", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
