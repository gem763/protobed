They are alleged to have recruited women along with 'various other 'scouts' tasked with the job of seeking out young, naive women between the ages of 17 [and] 24 because these women would not know how the film industry functioned,' the suit claims.\n\nLegal trouble: James Franco is being sued by two former students over sexual impropriety. The star is seen above in April while on the set of his HBO show The Deuce\n\nThe school's two-year program promised to teach students the Meisner method, 'as practiced by Franco while giving them the ability to audition and be hired as talent for RabbitBandini Productions,' the suit claims, making a reference to one of the actor's production firms, all the while 'sexually exploiting and humiliating female studens and actors.'\n\nThe complaint alleges that monthly tuition fees were used to fund Franco's productions, which violates California's 'pay for play' regulations, and lured students in by 'providing them false hopes of acquiring job opportunities.'\n\nThe alleged incidents are purported to have taken place in 2014, the same year the school opened in Los Angeles, as well as with a location in New York. Tither-Kaplan enrolled in the school in February of that year and Gaal in April.\n\nAccording to documents related to the case, Franco offered roles in films he was either producing or directing in exchange for the actresses performing explicit scenes or engaging in sexually-charged auditions for him.\n\nTither-Kaplan and Gaal's suit alleged that the Palo Alto actor/writer eschewed current film industry guidelines for nude scenes.\n\nDocuments from the case say that Franco 'routinely pressured to engage in simulated sex acts that went far beyond the standards in the industry.'\n\nGaal claims that she was denied entry to a special 'sex scenes master class' for expressing her concern over the class. 'She was told by a male employee to 'grow thicker skin' and stop being so sensitive,' the suit claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Tither-Kaplan says she was permitted to join the class and was also given roles in Franco productions, but only after required to shoot nude scenes or sex scenes.\n\nIn one particularly explicit incident, Tither-Kaplan alleges that during a scene of an orgy Franco removed plastic genital guards from the performers 'vaginas' in order to 'simulate oral sex on them.'\n\nCasting couch? The Deuce actor (seen above on the show) allegedly took advantage of his role as instructor by persuading female students to disrobe and/or engage in sexually-charged stage scenes with the suggestion they would get cast in one of his projects\n\nAlso... He owned the school with partner Vince Jolivette, above 2015, who is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit\n\n'Plaintiff Tither-Kaplan's willingness to push boundaries and do whatever it took to create a scene that Franco would approve of led to additional opportunities (which were then revoked after she voiced concerns),' the lawsuit claims.\n\nDuring their time at the school, Tither-Kaplan and Gaal paid monthly tuition of about $300.\n\nWhile they were previously promised exclusive auditions for Franco's independent projects, the women say the school made the auditions open to other actors as well.\n\nWhile initial tuition was only in the hundreds of dollars, the women said the school's additional 'master classes' could cost as much as $2000 a piece.\n\nAmong these offerings was a $750 course specializing in 'sex scenes.'\n\nAccording to the suit, prospective sex scene master class students had to audition via video tape so that Franco could 'review the material' on his own time.\n\nBy giving Franco the tapes, however, they were required to sign away their rights to said recordings.\n\nDuring the sex scene workshop, the women alleged that 'often young and inexperienced females.. were routinely pressured to engage in simulated sex acts that went far beyond the standards in the industry.'\n\nThe women in the class are said to have been denied the protection of nudity riders or other film industry guidelines pertaining to sex scenes.\n\nTither-Kaplan, pictured above, was among the first alleged victims to come forward after Franco's appearance at the 2018 Golden Globes, where he walked away with a win for best actor in a musical or comedy for his role in 'The Disaster Artist, and wore a 'Time's Up,' pin\n\nTither-Kaplan's tweet pictured above was among several made after Franco's appearance at the Golden Globes, alleging sexual improprieties and exploitation\n\nA lawyer for The Interview star, Michael Plonsker, told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement Thursday that Franco has yet to be served with the complaint, and said the allegations 'have already been debunked' in the past.\n\nThe statement read: 'This is not the first time that these claims have been made and they have already been debunked. We have not had an opportunity to review the ill-informed Complaint in depth since it was leaked to the press before it was filed and our client has yet to even be served.'\n\nPlonsker continued: 'James will not only fully defend himself, but will also seek damages from the plaintiffs and their attorneys for filing this scurrilous publicity seeking lawsuit.'\n\nThe lawsuit recalls Franco's appearance at the 2018 Golden Globes, where he walked away with a win for best actor in a musical or comedy for his role in 'The Disaster Artist, and wore a 'Time's Up,' pin, prompting the initial allegations of sexual improprieties and exploitation made against him.\n\n'Hey James Franco, nice #timesup pin at the #GoldenGlobes, remember a few weeks ago when you told me the full nudity you had me do in two of your movies for $100/day wasn't exploitative because I signed a contract to do it? Times up on that!' tweeted Tither-Kaplan. who was among the first alleged vicitms at the time.\n\nShe at that point had appeared in short films with Franco for over three years after enrolling at his school.\n\nAlso speaking out against Franco was Violet Paley, who tweeted: 'Cute #TIMESUP pin James Franco. Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis & that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17? After you had already been caught doing that to a different 17 year old?'\n\nAlso speaking out against Franco after his appearance at the 2018 Golden Globes was Violet Paley (pictured above) who alleged in a tweet that the actor 'pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis'\n\nAccusation: Paley said: '& that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17? After you had already been caught doing that to a different 17 year old?'\n\nPaley, an actress, writer and director living in Los Angeles, later clarified her tweet by writing: 'Just to be clear I wasn't 17, I was an adult.'\n\nThe age of consent in both New York and California is 17.\n\nPaley was accused by one man of only speaking up after Franco took home the Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical prize at the Golden Globes on Sunday, to which she replied: 'Hey dude, I get that it looks like that and 3 other girls and I have all spoken up before this. But this time it actually got attention because he's trending. Thanks for your concern!'\n\nPaley also liked a number of tweets posted by others calling out Franco and his hypocrisy for wearing a Time's Up pin to the ceremony.\n\nFranco was all smiles and signing autographs after his Golden Globe when he was spotted catching a flight at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nTither-Kaplan later was among five actresses who came forward in a Los Angeles Times expose about the alleged sexual improprieties and exploitation at the school\n\n'If I have done something wrong I will fix it. I have to,' said Franco in response to the public outcry, and in a quote that is repeated in the lawsuit.\n\n'But the truth is that James Franco and the other defendants, have committed egregious wrongs to hundreds of student actors and have done nothing to fix these wrongs,' the suit claims.", "description": "Sarah Tither-Kaplan and Toni Gaal are accusing the actor/director/writer engaged in 'inappropriate and sexually charged behavior toward female students' according to the New York Times.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
