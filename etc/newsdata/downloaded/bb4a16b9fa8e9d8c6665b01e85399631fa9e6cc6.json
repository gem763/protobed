Three ejections. Five pick-6s. Blown big leads. Major injuries (Nick Foles, Tyreek Hill, Eric Weddle).\n\nA tie. An SEC power versus an NAIA team, seemingly.\n\nAnd Antonio Brown landing in New England with a potentially lucrative contract after basically forcing himself out of two cities with his often repulsive behavior.\n\nMy goodness, what\u2019s next?\n\nIf fans itching for the return of America\u2019s most popular sport weren\u2019t entertained in Week 1 - well, the folks in Miami certainly weren\u2019t - they need to look elsewhere for their kicks.\n\nSpeaking of which, the kickers got in on the action, too.\n\nIndianapolis\u2019 Adam Vinatieri, likely headed to the Hall of Fame, experienced something for the first time in his 24-year career: two missed field goals and a missed extra point in the same game in a 30-24 OT loss to the Chargers . The Chargers\u2019 Ty Long became the first player since Miami\u2019s Olindo Mare in 1997 to have an extra point, field goal and punt in his first NFL game.\n\n\u201cThey play hard and they never give up,\u201d LA coach Anthony Lynn said of Indy, \u201cand our locker room is very similar, so it was a hell of a contest today. It\u2019s an exciting game. I\u2019m just glad we came out on the winning side and trust me, it took every man in that locker room to get this done today.\u201d\n\nYes, there was plenty of sloppiness, too. But the fears that the Thursday night kickoff contest won 10-7 by Green Bay - you have to appreciate strong defense in such games - was a harbinger and Sunday would be mired in a morass of mistakes basically were unfounded. Sure, the Dolphins looked like a team ready to match in reverse their 1972 undefeated record after being routed by the Ravens 59-10. And the Browns, who will be accused - accurately - of falling for the offseason hype about their improvement, must be embarrassed by being manhandled by the Titans, 34-13. In Cleveland. Drawing 18 penalties for 182 yards says a lot.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, I do not give a damn what happens on the outside,\u201d QB Baker Mayfield said. \u201cI know how we are going to react. I know what we are going to do. We are going to bounce back.\u201d\n\nAnd they might. Indeed, one of the charms of the NFL, as well as one of the most maddening characteristics, is how one week\u2019s outcome doesn\u2019t necessarily affect the next week. That\u2019s true over the course of the 16-game schedule.\n\nStill, it would be tons of fun to get a repeat next week, from the highlights to the fiascos.\n\nMaybe Lions fans would take umbrage with describing the Cardinals\u2019 comeback to tie Detroit fun. But consider the circumstances, including Arizona climbing out of an 18-point hole in the fourth quarter. With the top overall draft pick, Kyler Murray, and a certain Hall of Famer in receiver Larry Fitzgerald, leading the way.\n\nOr look at similar comebacks by Buffalo, Philadelphia and Indianapolis.\n\nThe biggest bummer were the disqualifications and the injury, particularly to Foles, who is being paid to be Jacksonville\u2019s franchise quarterback - something the Jaguars haven\u2019t had since Mark Brunell. And the disqualifications, all warranted.\n\nBrowns starting left tackle Greg Robinson was ejected for kicking Titans safety Kenny Vaccaro. Jaguars linebacker Myles Jack was sent packing after taking a swing at Chiefs linebacker Demarcus Robinson. Jack even had to be restrained by two team officials and essentially pulled off the field. San Francisco linebacker Kwon Alexander was penalized 15 yards and dismissed for lowering his helmet to initiate contact on a hit to Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston as he was sliding after a 5-yard run.\n\nAs we said, a bit of everything - with two more games to go Monday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "We've come to expect the unusual, the unpredictable, even the unfathomable on the opening weekend of the NFL season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/lions_cardinals_football_95912_c0-158-3777-2360_s1770x1032.jpg?0a59eb67b90a8472b550bbaad51dad168d1f6527", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
