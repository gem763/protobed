Turns out, none\u2026 as he reveals himself to be just some guy with a beef about Bitcoin. Oh, and also, Quantum computing isn\u2019t at risk of breaking Bitcoin any time soon, so chill out!\n\n\n\n\u201cI Am [Not] A Time-Traveler From The Future\u201d\n\nThe Time-Traveller story is one of the most endearing in Bitcoin\u2019s canon of out-there conspiracy theories, even resurfacing on Hong Kong national TV, being explained by a former beauty-queen. It emerged from a 2013 reddit post, purportedly from a future time-traveller living in a dystopian world, destroyed by Bitcoin.\n\nHODLers protect their assets by holing up in gated \u2018Citadels\u2019 to keep well away from the No-coiner masses. Most governments no longer exist, although that of North Korea inexplicably does, and holds 180,000 BTC (the largest remaining accessible stockpile).\n\nPerhaps we liked the story for its sheer unadulterated incredulity? Or maybe we liked it because we already had some BTC and (according to the time-traveller) would be safely ensconced inside a future Citadel?\n\nDemonstrably False\u2026 Even Before The Confession\n\nAside from the alluring predictions of exponentially increasing Bitcoin price, the time-traveller story gained a certain amount of prominence, because in its early years it seemed to be coming true\u2026 except of course, that it didn\u2019t.\n\nHowever, if you were hopped up on Hopium and reasonably adept at mental gymnastics then you could argue that the predicted figures roughly tallied with what came to pass.\n\n\u201cWell gee, this blew up.\u201d\n\nNow, however, the \u2018time-traveler\u2019 has returned, seeming genuinely surprised at the traction his post got. Despite his current admission of a lack of concrete future knowledge, he is still ranting against Bitcoin. Albeit now his main focus is on the network\u2019s energy consumption, which wasn\u2019t considered so much of an issue in 2013 when the original post was made.\n\nAs a Bitcoin investor, you\u2019re paying for Chinese businesses to waste electricity by solving an abstract math problem that is designed to get continually more difficult.\n\nHis suggested solution is to sell your bitcoin, which he claims, \u201cindirectly has the effect of reducing the ecological damage caused by Bitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nExcept of course\u2026 that it doesn\u2019t\u2026 unless everyone else does that too\u2026 in which case nobody is left to buy them.\n\nThe hardest of the hard-core tinfoil hat brigade may still attempt to cling on to the theory. After all, perhaps somebody just managed to hack the time-traveller\u2019s Reddit details? But for the rest of us\u2026 well I guess we still have a day for the 4Chan \u2018Wizard\u2019 to be proved right.\n\nQuantum Computing: Another Bitcoin Myth Busted\n\nWhilst we have our myth-busting hats on, lets have a look at this idea that quantum computing is about to break Bitcoin\u2019s cryptography.\n\nNot so, according to Blockstream CSO, Samson Mow. At a Liquid meetup in Las Vegas yesterday, he was quizzed over his thoughts on quantum computing.\n\nMow suggested that, although a 53 qubit quantum computer exists today, you would need 3000 qubits to break Bitcoin. And that isn\u2019t going to happen any time soon. Keep calm and carry on people.\n\nAre you in any way surprised that the Bitcoin Time-Traveller was a hoax?
