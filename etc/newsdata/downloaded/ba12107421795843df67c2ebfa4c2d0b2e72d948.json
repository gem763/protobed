If I have a choice, the first thing [I would do] is to quit, having made a deep apology,\u201d Lam said, her voice breaking with emotion. \u201cSo I make a plea to you for your forgiveness.\u201d\n\nThe remarks further demonstrate that it is Beijing rather than Lam directing the government\u2019s response to a political crisis that has threatened China\u2019s authority over the city, as protesters continue to take to the streets pressing for the extradition bill to be withdrawn and calling for universal suffrage.\n\nClashes continued on Monday night when police fired teargas to clear protesters in Mong Kok, a commercial and residential area in Kowloon.\n\nPlay Video 0:53 Thousands of Hong Kong students boycott first day of term - video\n\nIn the leaked recording, Lam said she was constrained by the fact the situation had reached \u201ca sort of sovereignty and security level\u201d of concern to the Beijing leadership, especially in the midst of \u201cunprecedented tension between the two big economies of the world\u201d \u2013 a reference to deteriorating economic and diplomatic ties between the US and China.\n\n\u201cThe political room for the chief executive who, unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution \u2013 that is, the central people\u2019s government and the people of Hong Kong \u2013 that political room for manoeuvring is very, very, very limited,\u201d she said.\n\nAs police appear to be cracking down more severely on protesters, resulting in more violent clashes, observers have wondered whether Hong Kong authorities have been ordered to put down the protests before 1 October, when the People\u2019s Republic of China marks its 70th birthday, a national holiday that Beijing would not want to see tarnished.\n\nBut Lam said Beijing had not imposed a deadline and was willing to wait out the unrest, even at the cost of damaging Hong Kong\u2019s economy. Officials were making special arrangements for a \u201cmodest but solemn\u201d 1 October celebration amid expectations of disruption.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that Beijing does not have a deadline. They know this will ripple on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are willing to play long, so you have no short-term solution. Hong Kong suffers, you lose tourism, economy, you lose your IPOs and so, but you can\u2019t do much about it.\u201d\n\nLam said there were no plans for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) to be deployed. \u201cMy own feeling [of] the pulse and through discussions, [Beijing] has absolutely no plan to send in the PLA.\u201d\n\nLam\u2019s comments came to light on Monday as thousands of university and secondary students in Hong Kong boycotted the first day of the new term , instead holding rallies and facing off against riot police in skirmishes into the night.\n\nThousands of students wearing helmets, goggles and masks \u2013 the unofficial uniform of the protesters \u2013 filled the grounds of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), holding black banners saying \u201cBoycott for freedom\u201d and periodically shouting \u201cReclaim Hong Kong\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you are not a slave, don\u2019t act like one,\u201d said one speaker, a woman introduced only by her surname, Chiu, from an alumni group, who urged students to remember their rights. A stage behind her featured a saying by Mao Zedong: \u201cA single spark can start a prairie fire.\u201d\n\nUniversity students have called for a two-week boycott, while secondary students have vowed to protest for one day a week until demonstrators\u2019 demands are met.\n\nIn a park across the city, outside of the government\u2019s headquarters, hundreds of people gathered in solidarity with students for a workers\u2019 rally. In the evening, dozens of protesters gathered outside the garrison for PLA troops stationed in the city.\n\n\u201cIf we are stopped by their violence, if we are frightened, I think our whole future will be over. It will be one country, one system,\u201d said Phillip Tsoi, 19, who was shining a laser into windows of the PLA complex to antagonise those inside.\n\nHong Kong, a former British colony under Chinese rule since 1997, is meant to enjoy certain freedoms and autonomy under a the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework, according to the terms of the handover.\n\nTensions between protesters, who say that promise has been broken, and authorities have escalated dramatically in recent weeks. On Saturday, police fired teargas and water cannons with dye at protesters who threw petrol bombs and lit fires. Police also targeted protesters and commuters in metro stations, beating them with batons. On Sunday, protesters paralysed transport links to Hong Kong airport.\n\nOn Monday, police said more than 1,000 people had been arrested since the demonstrations began in June, including 159 over the weekend, among them a 13-year-old boy found with two petrol bombs.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said in a regular news briefing on Monday that the demonstrations in Hong Kong had \u201ccompletely exceeded the scope of freedom of assembly\u201d. \u201cThey have evolved into extreme and violent actions,\u201d he said, reiterating Beijing\u2019s support for the Hong Kong government and police.\n\nIn an English-language editorial on Sunday, the Xinhua state news agency said: \u201cThe end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonise China.\u201d\n\nHong Kong residents say their city feels increasingly like it is under martial law. After the weekend of tense clashes, riot police patrolled railway stations as protesters blocked train doors from closing, causing delays and throwing morning rush hour into chaos. Police were seen arresting at least one group of protesters and searching people on the street.\n\nOn Monday morning, secondary school students kneeled, held hands and chanted in the rain outside their schools. A typhoon warning had closed many primary schools.", "description": "Carrie Lam\u2019s comments further demonstrate it is Beijing directing response to crisis", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e21eb21ed58f87463b9b4d2e7e5ac0f38f1d3fe2/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eac49977d96c1c44b0426fd9b7953d61"}
