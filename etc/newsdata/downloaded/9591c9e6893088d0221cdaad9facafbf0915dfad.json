It\u2019s designed to be paired with Apple\u2019s new $4,999 Pro Display XDR monitor, which in turn is mounted on a $999 Pro Stand.\n\nThat means Apple\u2019s new supercomputer will cost at least $12,000 before boosting any of its specs.\n\nApple shares were up 0.6 percent Monday morning, at $219.10.\n\nWith Reuters\n\nThis story originally appeared in the New York Post.", "description": "Apple\u2019s insanely expensive new desktop computer will be made in the United States \u2014 not China, the company announced Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/01/ContentBroker_contentid-cfebfdc2dd0c4b3b986be68ba5353154.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
