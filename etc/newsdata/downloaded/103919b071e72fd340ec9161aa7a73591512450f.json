John Cornyn (R-Texas), who called the attempt to fill the department without Senate confirmations a \u201cconcern.\u201d [Emphasis added] Cuccinelli once headed the Senate Conservatives Fund, an organization critical of the establishment GOP that ran primary campaigns against incumbents. That past has not been forgotten: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said earlier this year that he has a \u201clack of enthusiasm\u201d for Cuccinelli and warned in April about nominating Cuccinelli to the permanent position. [Emphasis added] McConnell stood by those remarks in a brief interview on Wednesday: \u201cI don\u2019t think I have anything to add to what I said about that earlier.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n\nSen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) and Sen. Shelley Capito (R-WV) also hinted to Politico that Cuccinelli was unliked by McConnell and Republican leadership in the Senate and thus would struggle to be confirmed for DHS Secretary.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said he has developed a good working relationship with Cuccinelli in recent months, as the conservative currently heads the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Trump has wanted to nominate Cuccinelli for the DHS job. Likewise, more than 100 conservative leaders and organizations have thrown their support behind Cuccinelli against the wishes of the Republican establishment.\n\n\u201cWe have no doubt that he will execute the president\u2019s agenda with the integrity, commitment, and excellence that we have known him to bring to every other position,\u201d the leaders wrote in a letter to Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, insiders have sought to prop up former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s chief of staff Chad Wolf for the opening. Wolf previously worked as a lobbyist, representing NASSCOM, a leader in the outsourcing industry that uses many H-1B visas to replace American workforces with an Indian workforce.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
