However, she also played the lead in X-Men: Apocalypse and dark Phoenix. She\u2019s also the face of Wella haircare.\n\nWhile their bank balance may make your eyes water, Lena Headey \u2013 who appeared in just 25 minutes of the final season \u2013 ended up making more than \u00a337,000 per minute for her last few instalments.\n\nEd Sheeran was ultimately named the richest celeb under 30, nabbing the title from Adele.\n\nGame of Thrones seasons one to eight are available to stream on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
