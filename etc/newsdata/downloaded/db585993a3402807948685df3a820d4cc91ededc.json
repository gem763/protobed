USA TODAY\n\nDETROIT \u2013 Ford Motor Co. issued three recalls on four vehicles in North America on Tuesday, including the 2019 Expedition and 2019 Lincoln Navigator SUVs built in September.\n\nThe popular Ford and Lincoln SUVs have been recalled for an issue involving the same component that led Ford to recall more than 1.2 million Explorers in mid-June built between 2010-17.\n\nUnlike the Explorer alert, this rapid recall for Expedition and Navigator comes before the company learning of any accidents or injury associated with the defect.\n\n\"In some of the affected vehicles, the rear toe link fastener may not have been properly tightened during assembly. An improperly secured fastener could allow the rear toe link to become disconnected while driving, which could increase the risk of injury or crash,\" Ford said in a release.\n\n2019 Ford Expedition platinum ingot silver. (Photo: Ford Motor Company)\n\nFord issued the latest alert affecting just 18 vehicles in the U.S. built at the Kentucky Truck Plant, the company said.\n\nThe toe link was cited in a recall of the Explorers, which are built at the Chicago Assembly Plant. In that case, Ford cited suspension toe link fractures \u2013 if the suspension moves a lot, a rear suspension toe link can break and that can affect a driver's ability to control steering, the company said at the time.\n\nFord has issued more than a dozen recalls within the past five months, including 2020 model-year vehicles.\n\n760-horsepower 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500: The most powerful street-legal Ford ever\n\nFord Transit recall\n\nAlso Tuesday, Ford issued a recall for select 2015-17 Transit vehicles where \"the driveshaft flexible coupling may crack with increasing mileage, resulting in driveline noise and vibration. Continued driving with a cracked flexible coupling may cause separation of the driveshaft, resulting in a loss of motive power, or unintended vehicle movement in park without the parking brake applied. In addition, separation of the driveshaft can result in secondary damage to surrounding components, including brake and fuel lines.\"\n\nFord noted, \"A driveshaft separation may increase the risk of injury or crash.\"\n\nThe company said it is unaware of any reports of accident or injury. The recall affects 293,558 vehicles in the U.S. and federal territories, 22,960 in Canada and 2,744 in Mexico. These vehicles were built at the Kansas City Assembly Plant between Jan. 17, 2014, and June 15, 2017.\n\nIIHS study finds: Automatic braking can be life-saving (except when it's not)\n\nSeat belt caution\n\nA handful of 2019 Ford Edge vehicles were recalled Tuesday for \"seat belt anchor separation\" due to an \"improperly crimped seat belt pretensioner anchor. In some of the affected vehicles, the driver\u2019s side seat belt assembly may not adequately restrain the occupant in a crash, increasing the risk of injury.\"\n\nFord said it is not aware of any reports of accident or injury associated with the issue. The company said the recall affects 366 vehicles in the U.S. and 65 in Canada built at Oakville Assembly Plant, Sept. 18-19, 2019.\n\nFollow Phoebe Wall Howard on Twitter @phoebesaid\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/10/29/ford-recall-transit-expedition-edge-lincoln-navigator/2495345001/", "description": "Ford Motor Co. issued three\u00a0recalls on four vehicles in North America on Tuesday, including the 2019 Expedition and 2019 Lincoln Navigator SUVs.", "authors": ["Phoebe Wall Howard", "Published A.M.
