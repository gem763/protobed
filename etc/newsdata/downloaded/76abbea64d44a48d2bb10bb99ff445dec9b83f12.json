Feeling like [flushed] [heartbroken] [sad] [excited].\"\n\nSchumer, 38, revealed last October that she and her husband, chef Chris Fischer, 39, were expecting their first child less than a year after they wed in a private ceremony in Malibu, California. Pregnancy was difficult for the actress, who suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum -- a severe form of morning sickness. In her latest Netflix comedy special, \"Growing,\" Schumer, who performed the set while visibly pregnant, joked about the condition, which has no cure.\n\n\"I threw up violently and felt sick mostly every day of my pregnancy,\" she wrote on Instagram after delivering Gene. \"Hyperemesis is real and it\u2019s awful. But f---, what they say is true. The second you give birth it\u2019s gone.\"\n\nSchumer has also been open about what new motherhood looks like. In addition to sharing a picture of herself postpartum, Schumer posted an image of herself pumping in her underwear, along with a message to critics who slammed her for doing a stand-up set a few weeks after her delivery.\n\n\"Sending out love to the moms shaming me for doing standup last night! #tinystairs #schumerpumprules,\" she wrote.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
