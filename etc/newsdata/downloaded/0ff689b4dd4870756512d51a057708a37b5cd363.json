The company added that it expects to post a loss before adjustments for the full year.\n\nShares in Continental rose 4.1%, as investors cheered the decision to separate the powertrain business, a move that could accelerate consolidation in the supply industry, which is struggling in the current slump.\n\nDemand for cars has dropped simultaneously in China, the U.S. and Europe. Analysts predict that global auto sales could decline 4% to 6% this year, the second year in a row of falling sales. Last year, global new-car sales were down about 0.5%, the first decline since 2009.\n\n\"We do not anticipate that global production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles will experience any material improvement in the next five years,\" Continental Chief Finance Officer Wolfgang Sch\u00e4fer told reporters on Tuesday, explaining why the company adjusted its outlook and valuations of businesses.\n\nMost of the charges against third-quarter earnings are the result of goodwill that the company has carried from acquisitions dating to 2008, Mr. Sch\u00e4fer said. Goodwill is accrued through the cost of the acquisition minus the fair market value of the assets acquired.\n\nThe biggest share, about EUR1.54 billion, affects the company's business with auto interiors, which includes electronics and onboard navigation and entertainment systems. It totaled EUR724 million in the chassis and safety-components business, and EUR244 million in powertrain.\n\nWhile the change won't occur immediately, analysts expect auto suppliers to be hit particularly hard as the industry shifts to producing electric cars and vehicles that are powered more by software than mechanical engineering.\n\nIn August, Continental said it would start phasing out production of components for internal-combustion engines because of a faster-than-expected fall in demand.\n\nThe news about the third-quarter write-downs also highlights the dilemma that suppliers find themselves in: As the business providing parts, services and technology for internal-combustion engines fades, electric-car sales are still too small to compensate for lost revenue.\n\n\"The business with electric vehicles is difficult, and it's going to remain so until we have more volume,\" Mr. Sch\u00e4fer said.\n\nWrite to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
