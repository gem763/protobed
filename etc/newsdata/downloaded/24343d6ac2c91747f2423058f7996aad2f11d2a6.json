I apologise.\"\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe case centres on millions of dollars the Samsung group paid Park's secret confidante Choi Soon Sil, allegedly for government favours such as ensuring a smooth transition for Lee to succeed his ailing father.\n\nThe scandal highlighted shady links between big business and politics in South Korea, with the ousted president and her friend accused of taking bribes from corporate bigwigs in exchange for preferential treatment.\n\nThe two women were both convicted and given decades-long jail sentences, and are due to face separate retrials of their own.\n\nBut the Supreme Court's decision does not bode well for Lee, as it ruled that 8.6 billion won (S$10 million) paid by Samsung should be considered as bribes.\n\n\"A bribery case exceeding 5 billion won is not eligible for a suspended jail term,\" independent attorney Shin Jang Sik said. \"I think he is likely to return to prison.\"\n\nLee has effectively been at the helm of the sprawling Samsung group since his father and group chairman Lee Kun-hee was left bedridden by a heart attack in 2014.\n\nBoth Lee's father and grandfather - Samsung founder Lee Byung Chull - had brushes with the law themselves but never served time behind bars.\n\nTRIAL OF A CENTURY\n\nSamsung Electronics is the flagship subsidiary of the group, which is by far the biggest of the family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebols, that dominate business in the world's 11th-largest economy.\n\nIts overall turnover is equivalent to a fifth of the national gross domestic product and it is crucial to South Korea's economic health, with the business daily Financial News calling the proceedings the \"trial of the century\".\n\nBut it comes with Samsung Electronics battling challenges from the US-China trade war and tough export restrictions imposed by Tokyo on key supplies amid a dispute with Seoul over wartime history.\n\nIt has flagged operating profits falling by more than half in the third quarter due to a prolonged global chip market slump, and has faced difficulties with the technology with some of its flagship new devices.\n\nLee is not being held in custody during the trial, but it is expected to last for months and could deprive the firm of its top decision-maker.\n\nWhile the firm's daily business is managed by a board of directors, a leadership vacuum would greatly hamper its ability to make major decisions, stockbroker KB Securities said in a report.\n\nThe retrial added to uncertainty for the company, said a source with direct knowledge, adding: \"There are things that only Lee Jae Yong can do.\"\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [SEOUL] The heir to the Samsung empire arrived at court on Friday for a retrial over a sprawling corruption scandal that threatens to disrupt management at the world's biggest smartphone and memory chip maker. .
