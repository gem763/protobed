The trick, of course, is not to send your guests home twitching from a caffeine high, but rather to instil an awareness of coffee as a culinary ingredient,\u201d says Jan on his blog.\n\nWe caught up with the chef to quiz him on a few of his own coffee quirks\u2026\n\nWhat's your earliest memory of coffee? When I was a child I used to dip farm bread with lots of butter on it into a cup of coffee. The fattiness of the butter would float on the surface of the coffee. TRY: Jan Hendrik's coffee butter recipe Do you have any special coffee-drinking rituals? I do. It\u2019s a little corny, but I\u2019ve got two pigeons that come to my kitchen window and every morning I make a cup of coffee for myself and give them some pine nuts to nibble on. They\u2019re probably the only birds in the world that get a handful of pine nuts (always slightly toasted)! I enjoy either a vanilla or caramel coffee. That\u2019s what usually gets me going. I have about three or four throughout the day.\n\n\n\nWhat model of Nespresso machine do you have? We'd love to know. I used to have a very little one and then they gave me a really nice one with a proper frothing function and everything, but I drink my coffee black with no sugar.\n\n\n\nAside from the new barista range, do you have any other favourite Nespresso varieties? I just love the vanilla or caramel flavours \u2013 it\u2019s like having dessert before your day even starts. I also love an affogato dessert, or just two espresso shots in a little Tupperware: frozen, and then you just keep flaking it like you would a granita and serve it with plain Greek yoghurt. It\u2019s delicious!
