They smoke in sports arenas. They smoke in family restaurants and late-night bars. They smoke at the music venue where Maria Pavlopoulou \u2014 a cancer survivor who has puffed her way through breakups and financial distress \u2014 now spends her Friday and Saturday nights singing oldies in the cigarette haze.\n\n\u201cOf course, I realize it\u2019s an addiction,\u201d said Pavlopoulou, 53, who then took a pouch of tobacco from her purse and rolled her next cigarette. \u201cBut smoking makes me feel that I\u2019m well.\u201d\n\nIn a country that has been stressed to the max over the past decade, tobacco is the main vice. Nearly 2 in 5 Greeks 15 and older smoke daily, the highest rate in Europe. World Health Organization numbers put Greece among the heaviest smoking countries globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen his government took office in July, for the first time in memory, staffers and politicians stopped smoking inside the Parliament building.\n\nThe notion of enforcing a health law is, by itself, a sign of how post-crisis Greece may be changing.\n\nGreek authorities have a long, tormented track record of creating regulations \u2014 whether about parking or tax collection \u2014 and looking the other way. In the case of the smoking ban, furious bar and restaurant owners rebelled when it was imposed, saying they couldn\u2019t afford to chase off customers during what became a historic recession.\n\nBut advocates for the ban say that if Greeks are now able to rally behind any law, it should be one that can help reduce medical costs, stem an epidemic and bring the country up to the health standards of much of the rest of Europe and the United States.\n\n\u201cClean air is a basic need,\u201d said George Balafoutis, a Microsoft cybersecurity architect who launched a website listing the bars and restaurants nationwide \u2014 464, as of now \u2014 that are already smoke-free.\n\nEnforcing the law, though, means confronting a nationwide addiction.\n\nSmoking starts early for Greeks, and kiosks sell cigarettes right in front of schools. Even the healthiest Greeks can\u2019t easily get away. American basketball coach Rick Pitino, coaching a Greek club earlier this year, criticized fans for smoking inside the arena, saying they were \u201cself-centered\u201d and didn\u2019t \u201ccare about young people and the athletes who are breathing it in.\u201d\n\nAt one cancer clinic in Athens, doctors say half the patients continue to smoke during their treatment. At another hospital across town, those lighting up in front of an outdoor sign that tells them not to include patients, relatives and staff.\n\nThere among the smokers, a 67-year-old with an IV drip and circulation problems said she was told earlier that day by her doctor to stop. A 70-year-old said he was smoking \u201ca little more than usual today,\u201d because his daughter was having surgery. A 56-year-old said he was smoking because he was on his morning break; he\u2019d liquidated his construction company in 2011, spent five years unemployed and then found a job at the hospital pushing gurneys.\n\n\u201cI started smoking in the army \u2014 like most guys,\u201d the hospital staffer, Anestis Aslanides, said with a shrug.\n\n\n\nAshtrays remain a common feature in Athens. (Loulou d'Aki/For The Washington Post)\n\nEven hospital cafes are filled with smokers. (Loulou d'Aki/For The Washington Post)\n\nWhile other countries consider restrictions on vaping, based on reports of a mysterious lung illness and emerging evidence that flavored nicotine liquid is hooking children, the risks of traditional cigarettes are far better understood \u2014 and more widespread.\n\nThe World Health Organization says more than 8 million people die every year from tobacco, including 1.2 million nonusers who are exposed to smoke secondhand.\n\nBecause of its failure to enforce the ban, Greece has far and away Europe\u2019s smokiest restaurants, bars and workplaces. According to 2017 European Commission data, 78 percent of Greeks say they\u2019re exposed to smoke when they go out to eat. In most European countries, that figure is below 10 percent.\n\nThe initial Greek antismoking law actually came in two attempts \u2014 a patchwork version in 2009, which never took hold, and then a more forceful version in 2010, which called for a complete ban on smoking in all indoor public spaces, excluding casinos and some large music venues. Businesses that violated the law could face fines of up to 10,000 euros.\n\nThe country\u2019s U.S.-born, socialist prime minister at the time, George Papandreou, said the ban would help \u201cmake our country viable \u2014 not just its economy but in everyday life.\u201d But by 2015, according to Greek media, a government hotline to report violators was defunct. By 2016, Greece\u2019s deputy health minister was smoking his way through a news conference.\n\nNow, the new conservative government has said it is time for the country to change. It intends to start following through on fines for violators. One pulmonologist advising the government, Panagiotis Behrakis, said he is also pushing for a campaign describing secondhand smoke as a \u201chuman rights violation.\u201d\n\nAlready, Greeks abide by nonsmoking rules in some places: on the Metro, for instance, and in department stores. Trendy new restaurants have opened with smoke-free rules, and the percentage of smokers has fallen slightly in recent years. Polls suggest most Greeks are in favor of enforcement.\n\nBut following laws in Greece has never been that simple.\n\n\u201cI was two times pregnant during the parliamentary session, and I suffered tremendously,\u201d said Niki Kerameus, Greece\u2019s new education minister. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a place in Parliament where I wasn\u2019t exposed. If we don\u2019t start enforcing the laws where they are actually voted, what hope is there for anybody else?\u201d\n\nSome experts note, with curiosity, that Greeks are better at following smoking bans when they leave their country.\n\n\u201cWhen you see them abroad, they respect \u2014 completely \u2014 the regulations and laws,\u201d said Pagona Lagiou, an adjunct professor at Harvard University and a professor of epidemiology at the University of Athens Medical School. \u201cAt home, they are not doing quite so well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink about it,\u201d said Balafoutis, who by day designs cybersecurity programs for banks, government branches and pharmaceutical companies. \u201cIf they ignore this, what other laws are they cutting corners on? Cleanliness? Quality of meats? How they treat workers?\u201d\n\n\u201cFix this,\u201d he said, \u201cand more fixing will happen.\u201d\n\nBut some Greeks would prefer to continue smoking and put off dealing with some of their broader stresses.\n\nPavlopoulou, who moonlights as a singer, said she realizes she should stop smoking. In her day job, she works 12-hour shifts at a cardiologist\u2019s office. She handles paperwork for insurance claims. The smokers always pay more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the No. 1 factor,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, as Pavlopoulou tells it, through much of her life, cigarettes have been her comfort. She smoked when her mother died, and she smoked when straining to help several unemployed siblings during the economic crisis and she smoked throughout her treatment several years ago for bowel cancer. Maybe that cancer was related to smoking; maybe it wasn\u2019t \u2014 Pavlopoulou isn\u2019t sure. But she remembers the cigarettes she smoked in the months after her treatment, after the numbness and the other side effects from chemotherapy, after the panic attacks and the dizziness. She was forced to cut out red meat and fast food and soda, and when at last she went out with some friends, she was worried about whether she might die, and whether she could be her old self.\n\n\u201cTo have a cigarette,\u201d she said, \u201cmade me feel part of life.\u201d\n\nShe has kept her view on cigarettes in the years since, smoking a pack a day, and the venue where she sings \u2014 small, smoky \u2014 is one of the joints that has fully ignored the ban. On weekend nights, Pavlopoulou shares the stage with several other singers for four-hour sets, playing in front of a mostly older crowd that she says is probably not ready to change.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget,\u201d Pavlopoulou said by way of explaining, \u201cthat Greeks have been through a lot these last years.\u201d\n\nElinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nWhere are all the children?
