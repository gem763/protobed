A Commerce spokesman said Mr. Ross hadn\u2019t threatened to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian, but declined to say whether the secretary had contacted NOAA on the matter.\n\nMr. Trump on Wednesday denied directing Mr. Mulvaney to disavow the forecasters who had contradicted his assertion about the threat to Alabama. \u201cI never did that,\u201d he said, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nThe president first raised the notion of Hurricane Dorian hitting Alabama in a Sept. 1 tweet, where he said the state, along with three others, would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d Soon afterward, the National Weather Service in Birmingham tweeted that Alabama would \u201cNOT see any impacts\u201d from the storm. In the following days, Mr. Trump continued to aggressively defend his assertion, including displaying a Sharpie-doctored map in the Oval Office that added Alabama to the path of the storm.\n\nOn Friday, NOAA released a statement calling the Birmingham forecaster\u2019s tweet \u201cinconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, acting NOAA chief scientist Craig McLean said in an email to employees that he was investigating whether the agency\u2019s response to Mr. Trump\u2019s Alabama tweet constituted a violation of NOAA policies and ethics.\n\nThe head of the National Weather Service, Louis Uccellini, on Monday offered a robust defense of the Birmingham forecasters, saying they \u201cdid what any office would do.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology sent a letter to Mr. Ross requesting information related to NOAA\u2019s actions in response to the president\u2019s Alabama claim, including a reported directive to staff barring them from publicly contradicting Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet and records of his reported threat to fire NOAA officials if they didn\u2019t support the White House\u2019s messaging.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disturbed by the politicization of NOAA\u2019s weather forecast activities for the purpose of supporting incorrect statements by the president,\u201d Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D., Texas), the Science Committee chairwoman, and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D., N.J.), chairwoman of an oversight subcommittee, wrote in the letter.\n\nIn their letter, the lawmakers also pointed to Mr. Ross\u2019s own comments during his confirmation hearing in 2017. There, he was asked whether he supported a NOAA policy under which the agency\u2019s scientists aren\u2019t required to seek permission to publicly share their scientific expertise.\n\n\u201cI support the dissemination of valid information to the public,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think that valid information should be concealed.\u201d\n\nWrite to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "description": "The White House pushed for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to walk back a tweet that contradicted President Trump\u2019s claim that Hurricane Dorian likely posed a threat to Alabama.", "authors": ["Catherine Lucey", "Rebecca Ballhaus", "Catherine.Lucey Wsj.Com", "Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106400/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
