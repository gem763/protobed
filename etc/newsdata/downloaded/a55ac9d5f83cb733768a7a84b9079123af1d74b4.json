REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo\n\nReal estate mogul Virwani\u2019s Embassy Group, backed by U.S. private equity fund Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N), set up WeWork India two years ago and had been in talks to sell the bulk of the operation to the brand\u2019s global parent The We Company.\n\nVirwani said those discussions had been put on hold indefinitely and that Embassy was raising around 40 billion rupees ($563.06 million) from sales of some its assets that it would invest in WeWork India if need be.\n\n\u201cEven if we have to put all that money ... to grow WeWork India, we will continue,\u201d Virwani, whose son Karan heads WeWork India, told Reuters in an interview.\n\nAfter one of the most dramatic collapses of a stock market flotation in recent memory, The We Company jettisoned founder and Chief Executive Officer Adam Neumann last month and is looking at financial cutbacks to help seal new investment.\n\nInvestors have expressed concerns about its burgeoning losses as well as how well a business model that involves taking long-term leases and renting out spaces for the short term will weather a global downturn.\n\nJitu Virwani said WeWork India, which plans to double its current capacity of 45,000 seats in six Indian cities by the end of 2020, would be profitable by the end of next year.\n\n\u201cAdam Neumann or no Adam Neumann, our business is here to stay,\u201d Virwani said at a roundtable discussion with journalists.\n\n\u201cYes, it (WeWork\u2019s IPO failure) has been a bit of a challenge for us, we had a bit of a setback when we were looking to raise $100 million from ICICI. But we\u2019ve decided to put our own money into the business (if needed),\u201d he added.\n\nASIA\n\nWeWork announced separately that it would open two new offices for co-working in Singapore and two in Manila, signs of a broadening of its base in Asia after media reports that the company was reining in plans for China.\n\nEmbassy has so far pumped roughly 14 billion rupees into the Indian WeWork business, which includes 9 billion rupees from Embassy itself, 3 billion rupees from ICICI Bank, and 2 billion rupees from other investors such as Tata Capital.\n\nThe $200 million that WeWork India is looking to raise could be entirely in equity or through a mix of debt and equity, said Karan Virwani, though he said reaching the company\u2019s earlier valuation of around $3 billion might now be a challenge.\n\n\u201cNow if I go to an ICICI or any lender, somebody could give us a valuation of $800 million, somebody could say $1 billion or somebody could say $1.5 billion,\u201d Jitu Virwani said.", "description": "WeWork's India franchise has seen talks with existing backer ICICI Bank on $100 million in new funding break down since The We Company's botched stock market launch and is in discussions on raising $200 million from other investors, the venture's chief shareholder Jitu Virwani said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Anirban Sen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439223850&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990OP-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
