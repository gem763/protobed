But private insurance may feel the biggest squeeze.\n\nHospitals get paid more from private insurance than they do from Medicare and Medicaid. They say government programs don\u2019t pay them enough to stay in business, and that they make up the difference by charging higher prices for private plans.\n\nAs Baby Boomers continue to retire, shifting out of their employer plans and into Medicare, more of hospitals\u2019 work will be reimbursed at lower Medicare rates \u2014 creating more pressure to make up more revenue through more price increases on private coverage.\n\n\u201cWill employers be the place of last resort over and over and over again, and is that sustainable?\u201d Democratic health care consultant Chris Jennings said.\n\nCritics say hospitals are misrepresenting how far their Medicare payments go, but either way, it's the prevailing logic in how prices are set.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: Jennings is among the policy experts arguing that employers have a strong incentive to get more proactive about cost control now. In recent years, they\u2019ve responded to rising costs mainly by shifting more of the overall burden onto employees.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t done much to control the underlying price of care, which just keeps rising.\n\n\u201cThis trend line continues, and we may be getting to this inflection point here that\u2019s just unsustainable: \u2018I can\u2019t be the [only] entity that\u2019s paying these rates,\u2019\u201d Jennings said.\n\nThe bottom line: Businesses don't have the same cost control leverage that government payers do, meaning that becoming engaged in politics will be their primary route to reprieve.\n\nIf they don't, the consequences could be dire, experts warn.\n\n\u201cI do not think it\u2019s sustainable, not if [employers] continue to have expectations of meaningful return on investment for their shareholders and having access to capital based on their capacity to produce earnings to grow their companies,\" said John Bardis, a former Trump administration health official.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most serious financial problem facing the country during the next 20 years,\" Bardis added.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "Employers will bear the brunt of rising health care prices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/FO3iuhqXguKfc9BIc-W64__cLkc=/0x0:2400x1350/1920x1080/2019/04/05/1554492145299.png", "published_at": "2019-04-08"}
