(The staff is organizing with the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 153.) Instead, the company wants a National Labor Relations Board election.\n\nIn an email to the entire staff, Hasan expressed concern that a union would hurt the company. Kickstarter has faced a number of challenges, Hasan writes. \u201cI recognize the need for better communication, definition around roles and responsibilities, clarity around compensation, and processes that allow for perspectives to be shared and captured across the organization.\u201d The company also suffers from what Hasan characterizes as \u201ca lack of trust among the people who work here.\u201d\n\nHasan, who took the CEO job in March 2019, says that some employees have discussed a union as a solution to Kickstarter\u2019s problems. However, he says that after some reflection, \u201cour view is that we are better set up to be successful without the framework of a union. I feel that it is important to be clear and honest with you about our thinking on this.\u201d\n\nA union would \u201csignificantly change the way we operate and work together.\u201d Hasan says. He pointed out some concerns he had \u2014 that \u201csome supervisors have been involved in the organizing process\u201d and how that might \u201c[create] a risk that employees will feel pressured by their managers to support or oppose the union effort.\u201d (Hasan did take pains to say that Kickstarter\u2019s management isn\u2019t trying to impinge on the rights of its staff to organize.)\n\nIn the email, Hasan notes that there is a rising current of worker activism in America, and that what\u2019s happening at Kickstarter \u201cisn\u2019t taking place in a vacuum.\u201d The members of Kickstarter\u2019s union recognize that too: in the memo they published when they announced their plans to unionize, they said they were interested in union protections for themselves as much as they were interested for them for other tech companies. \u201cWe can do better together \u2014 for ourselves and our industry.\u201d", "description": "\"I know this position is disappointing to some of you who were hoping the company would voice support for this effort,\" CEO Aziz Hasan wrote", "authors": ["Bijan Stephen", "May"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-5gSSQusZy-ZI-b_4DrJy74bC4Y=/0x45:2040x1113/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16034021/akrales_190328_3325_0507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-15"}
