We wanted to overcome that challenge.'\n\nProfessor Martinez said these new pre-stressed soft robots have several significant advantages over existing soft robotic systems and can even catch live insects\n\nThe light weight components of the robots makes them capable of rapid movements, here its internal pneumatic channel expands upon pressurisation (left). The pre-stressed robot relaxes and recoils when pressure is removed (right)\n\nProfessor Martinez said these new pre-stressed soft robots have several significant advantages over existing soft robotic systems.\n\nFirst, they excel at gripping, holding and manipulating a large variety of objects at high speed.\n\nThey can use the elastic energy stored in their pre-stressed elastomeric layer to hold objects up to 100 times their weight without consuming any external power.\n\nTheir soft skin can be easily patterned with anti-slip microspikes, which significantly increases their traction and enables them to perch upside down over prolonged periods of time and facilitates the capture of live prey.\n\nAs the soft arms of the grippers are able to conform to the object this means a large contact area is achieved facilitating high-speed catching and allowing the robot to 'grip' the object without exerting power\n\n'We envision that the design and fabrication strategies proposed here will pave the way toward a new generation of entirely soft robots capable of harnessing elastic energy to achieve speeds and motions currently inaccessible for existing robots,' Martinez said.\n\nMany birds, like the three-toed woodpecker, use the elastic energy stored in the stressed tendons at the back of their legs, allowing them to not fall off a perch when asleep without using their own energy.\n\nThe anatomy of these birds has served as an example to enable the fabrication of robotic grippers capable of zero power holding up to 100 times their weight and perching upside down from angles of up to 116 degrees.\n\nSeemingly spring-loaded and able to catch the speediest of flies, the chameleon's sticky tongue is a formidable weapon\n\nAs the soft arms of the grippers are able to conform to the object this means a large contact area is achieved facilitating high-speed catching and allowing the robot to 'grip' the object without exerting power.\n\nSome plants also know how to exploit elastic energy to achieve high-speed motion using 'trap mechanisms.'\n\nThe Venus flytrap uses the elastic energy stored in its curved leaves to rapidly close on prey exploring their inner surface.\n\nInspired by the trap mechanism of the Venus flytrap and studying how lizards catch insects, the Purdue team also created a soft robotic Venus flytrap, which closes in only 50 milliseconds after receiving a short pressurised stimulus.\n\nThis technology is published in the Oct. 25 edition of Advanced Functional Materials.", "description": "Chameleons, salamanders and toads were the inspiration for engineers at the Purdue University, Indiana, U.S, who developed a new range of soft robots capable of fast automated movements.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/16/20333528-0-image-a-44_1572366365403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
