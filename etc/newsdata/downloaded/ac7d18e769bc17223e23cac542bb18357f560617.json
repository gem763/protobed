It\u2019s just a big milestone being met and our sport has space for all sorts of things and I think it will appeal and add value.\u201d\n\nRoger Bannister\u2019s first sub-four minute mile in 1954 was achieved with the aid of pacemakers, while just about every middle and long-distance race on the elite Diamond League circuit uses them \u2013 and they do not complete the race.\n\nDecades ago it was a disqualification offence if a runner took a drink within the first 10 miles of a marathon and Briton Coe, who set three middle-distance track world records in 41 days in 1979, recognises the anomalies.\n\n\u201cIt may be in years to come that we review those regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be a broad church here and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve encouraged federations and individuals to be brave and encouraged our commercial partners to activate in smart ways around the sport. I don\u2019t want us to be the \u2018computer says no\u2019 federation.\u201d\n\nINCLUSIVITY QUEST\n\nCoe carries that quest for inclusivity to the ever-expanding area of trail and mountain-road running, where superstars such as 31-year-old Spaniard Kilian Jornet are attracting armies of fans and lucrative sponsorship deals while many track and field athletes and events are struggling.\n\n\u201cWe are connected and have a memorandum of understanding with trail,\u201d he said. \u201cLong before I was a (IAAF) Council member we were a bit sniffy about road running, much to our cost actually, and I don\u2019t want anything like that.\n\n\u201cWe are also talking to parkrun (the free weekly 5km events that now have over six million registered runners worldwide) and our new website will be all about that aspect \u2013 getting people moving and inclusivity.\u201d\n\nContinuing with his off-road theme, Coe said he would like to see the return of cross country to the Olympics \u2013 it was last raced in 1924 \u2013 but ideally as part of the Winter Games.\n\nCoe has long recognised that traditional athletics has to fight to \u201cstay relevant\u201d and that battle is starkly illustrated by the Diamond League and the fractured athletics calendar.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at formats \u2013 what should a one-day meeting look like? I think there\u2019s agreement that we need some relatively radical change,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOver the course of the year, how do people follow the sport? How do they follow the athlete from the beginning of the season to a world championships?\u201d\n\nThe latest edition of that event starts in Doha on Friday \u2013 with Coe standing unopposed for re-election on Wednesday.\n\nFor all his concerns, and what many consider the still-unfilled void left by the retirement of Jamaica\u2019s sprinting great Usain Bolt, the IAAF president is hugely upbeat about the next generation and the way they are engaging with fans.\n\n\u201cLook at (Norwegian 400m runner) Karsten Warholm \u2013 the impact he had on the stadium in Zurich and Paris was staggering,\u201d Coe said.\n\n\u201cThe Ingebrigtsens (the three Norwegian middle-distance-running brothers Henrik, Filip and Jakob) are knocking broadcast numbers out of the park with their reality TV show. (Venezuelan triple jumper) Yulimar Rojas is huge in South America.\n\n\u201cI recognise that they are generally not the big, worldwide names yet but I cannot remember a time in athletics when I have been more excited about the young talent coming through.\u201d", "description": "The head of world athletics Sebastian Coe wants to end his federation's 'computer says no' approach which would mean that if Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge runs a sub-two hour marathon next month it would not be ratified as a world record.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433270140&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0L6-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
