After three rain-interrupted days the match is delicately poised. Australia are the only combatant with a chance of winning but to do so they must engineer 15 English wickets on a surface containing few demons; not to mention find enough time to plunder enough second-innings runs of their own to bolt the backdoor behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s a well-worn cliche this series but the opening hour, and opening session, will be crucial. Should England survive the remaining six overs with the old ball and progress through the early stages of the second new Dukes without much alarm, Australia\u2019s task will grow in difficulty by the minute. A rapid collapse and England will be staring at an almighty rearguard action this evening and throughout tomorrow.\n\nOnce again England turn to Ben Stokes for protection. He has the complexion of a Wildling and the glacial melt eyes of a White Walker but with Stokes on night\u2019s watch his teammates could sleep soundly knowing the best-equipped batsman in the team will be at the crease for potentially the most significant passage of play in the Test. Around him Jonny Bairstow, and in particular Jos Buttler - when he strides out as a specialist No.8 - must prove their worth. The latter is a luxury England can ill-afford in recent form, unless he switches codes and transforms into Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard; but not both, never both, we don\u2019t want to open that can of worms again.\n\nAustralia\u2019s day will be determined in two phases. In the morning session with the new ball the relentlessly impressive Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins will hope to recapture the venom that threatened to rip the match decisively their way late yesterday. After lunch all eyes turn to Nathan Lyon to exploit a surface that is increasingly receptive to spin.\n\nIt all amounts to what should be an engrossing day of Test match cricket.\n\nIf you want to be a part of it you can drop me a line on Twitter or you can send me an email.", "description": "Over-by-over report: The fourth Test continues at Old Trafford with England narrowly avoiding the follow-on.
