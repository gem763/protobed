After overcoming the hurdle of discovering Mackenzie (Emily Weir) is Rick Booth\u2019s (Mark Lee) daughter, she\u2019s managed to bag a trial at Salt.\n\nKaren is nervous on the day of her trial, and is disappointed when she finds out Dean won\u2019t be on shift at the same time. It doesn\u2019t take long for her to feel overwhelmed with the ordering system, as she isn\u2019t used to using high-tech options to send orders to the kitchen.\n\nHer self confidence starts to suffer after she mixes up an order, and Mac steps in to take over. When Mac tells Karen to take out the garbage, Karen watches Dean with Ziggy (Sophie Dillman), and starts to feel even more distant from her son and his clearly happy, settled life.\n\nKaren wants to settle in with Dean (Picture: Channel 5)\n\nShe then starts to feel unwell from the side effects of her medication, but is too scared to tell Mac she needs time out, so tries to plough through. When she makes another mistake by spilling some food on John (Shane Withington), he ends up making a huge fuss. Completely overwhelmed, Karen snaps and dumps a drink on his head!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDean is appalled at his mother\u2019s behaviour, and as he scolds her, she collapses. When Karen comes around, Dean is anything but sympathetic, saying that she was putting it on for attention. Despite insisting that\u2019s not what happened, Dean doesn\u2019t believe her, so she storms out.\n\nLater on, Dean is confronted by Ziggy, who has been speaking to Dr Alex (Zoe Ventoura). The two women tell him that Karen\u2019s medication does come with serious side effects, and explains that fainting could well happen as a result of her stress levels. Dean soon realises he\u2019s made a terrible mistake\u2026\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Ben reveals huge investigation update to Maggie\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Mackenzie and Karen in showdown over Rick\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Karen is working a trial for Mackenzie at Salt, but Dean is appalled when she snaps with John.", "authors": ["Imogen Groome"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EP-7210-John-S.WITHINGTON-tells-Dean-P.OCONNOR-and-Karen-G.ADAMSON-that-he-d-be-happy-to-receive-an-apology_HAA-1442_0200-3695_1571990266.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
