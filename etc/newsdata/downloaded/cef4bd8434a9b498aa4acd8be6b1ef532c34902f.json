He\u2019s officially changed the Washington conversation from impeachment to a unified, bipartisan opposition to his sudden decision to abandon the Kurds in Syria. More from Burgess Everett\n\nHE HAS the Chinese coming to Washington at the end of the week to try to wrap up a trade deal. NYT\u2019S CARL HULSE and EMILY COCHRANE are reporting Congress could vote on USMCA before Thanksgiving, giving the president the second-biggest legislative win of his presidency, after tax reform.\n\nHOW DO HOUSE DEMOCRATS keep momentum in their impeachment probe? Some worry about that, as the party has mostly retreated behind closed doors to take testimony from various witnesses. Without ready-for-TV moments, and in the absence of fresh allegations from a new whistleblower, impeachment risks fading from the news. Of course, the president is liable to go on the South Lawn and admit to what Democrats consider additional impeachable offenses at any point. But Trump\u2019s power to control the headlines day in and day out is a challenge for Democrats, and it\u2019s not one they\u2019ve quite solved yet.\n\nNEW \u2026 THE POLLING THE HOUSE GOP IS LOOKING AT \u2026 HOUSE REPUBLICANS held a conference call Monday to discuss new polling commissioned by Team McCarthy and the NRCC, and the headline for the GOP is this: Just 37% of voters believe TRUMP\u2019S phone call with the Ukrainian president is impeachable, while 59% say it was appropriate and not worthy of impeachment. 39% of independents say it is impeachable. (Republicans say this is strong polling for them, but Democrats would argue they haven't publicly started prosecuting the case.)\n\n-- IN TRUMP DISTRICTS represented by Democrats, 62% of those polled think it was appropriate and just 33% say it\u2019s impeachable.\n\n-- INTERESTING DATA POINT: THEY ASKED THIS QUESTION: \u201cNow, I\u2019d like to read you a few statements regarding this matter, and please tell me whether you agree or disagree with each one. \u2026 If Democrats are going to proceed, they should set a date certain to end the inquiry so it does not further politicize next year's election.\u201d 65% say yes, and 31% say no. \u2026 The polling memo Republicans got \u2026 The polling presentation\n\nSMART STORY \u2026 L.A. TIMES\u2019 SARAH WIRE: \u201cWhy Republicans may want a House vote on impeachment inquiry and Pelosi doesn\u2019t\u201d: \u201cBeneath the heated argument of whether the House should have a formal resolution to open an impeachment inquiry is a potential benefit for Republicans, if they can force a vote: the chance to subpoena their own witnesses and information.\n\n\u201cIn both the Nixon and Clinton impeachment inquiry resolutions, the minority party on the investigating committee was granted the power to subpoena \u2014 something the minority party does not normally have. Subpoenas were still subject to a vote of the committee, giving the majority party a way to block them.\n\n\u201cIf similar language were included in a House impeachment inquiry resolution against President Trump \u2014 which is what Republicans are pushing for \u2014 it would theoretically enable GOP members to, say, subpoena testimony or information from former Vice President Joe Biden, or his son Hunter, or try to take the inquiry into an entirely different direction.\n\n\u201cThe issue could come to a head soon amid reports that the White House plans to announce it will not comply with Democrats\u2019 investigation, or subpoenas, unless the House holds a formal vote opening an impeachment inquiry. \u2026\n\n\u201cEven if she allows a vote, there is no guarantee that Pelosi would grant subpoena power to ranking members, allow the president\u2019s counsel to be present during depositions or other items Republicans say they want in the resolution, said Julian Epstein, former chief counsel for the House Judiciary Committee Democrats during Clinton\u2019s impeachment. But if she didn\u2019t, that would give Republicans something new to complain about.\u201d LAT\n\nALSO: POLITICALLY, the GOP believes a floor vote for impeachment is damaging for Democrats because it forces them to go on the record in a dramatic vote. But the White House is playing with fire by not complying here, since Democratic leaders say that in and of itself could be considered part of a cover-up.\n\nGood Tuesday morning, and LET\u2019S GO NATS!

Reuters\u2019 preview\n\n-- THE NEW WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY: \u201cWhite House to battle impeachment by stalling, attacking,\u201d by AP\u2019s Jill Colvin, Zeke Miller and Jonathan Lemire: \u201cAs House Democrats fire off more subpoenas, the White House is finalizing a high-stakes strategy to counter the impeachment threat to President Donald Trump: Stall. Obfuscate. Attack. Repeat.\n\n\u201cTrump aides are honing their approach after two weeks of what allies have described as a listless and unfocused response to the impeachment probe. One expected step is a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejecting the inquiry because Democrats haven\u2019t held a vote on the matter and moving to all but cease cooperation with Capitol Hill on key oversight matters.\u201d AP\n\n-- ANITA KUMAR: \u201c\u2018An avoidable, unforced error\u2019: Trump\u2019s Ukraine trap starts worrying allies\u201d: \u201cHigh-level Trump supporters who have stood by the president for years are growing increasingly unsettled by his latest strategy of dismissing the latest fight as Russia 2.0. Half-a-dozen senior Republicans, including those who both talk directly to Trump and advise him on everything from campaign strategy to policy, communications and fundraising, said in interviews that they fear the president's plan to tie Russia and Ukraine could be ineffective because it dismisses the seriousness of the allegations and the fact that he admitted his actions.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- WAPO: \u201cHouse Democrats consider masking identity of whistleblower from Trump\u2019s GOP allies in Congress,\u201d by Rachael Bade, Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima and Karoun Demirjian: \u201cHouse Democrats are weighing extraordinary steps to secure testimony from a whistleblower whose complaint prompted their impeachment inquiry, masking his identity to prevent President Trump\u2019s congressional allies from exposing the individual, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations.\n\n\u201cThe steps under consideration include having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual\u2019s appearance and voice, these officials said.\u201d WaPo\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It's unclear when the 78-year-old senator will return to the stump. His campaign has yet to divulge the severity of his heart attack.\n\n\u201cAnd that sequence of events unfolded as he\u2019s been eclipsed in the polls by the other progressive icon in the race, Elizabeth Warren. Now Sanders and his campaign are laboring to contain the cloud of uncertainty that's formed over his candidacy. According to interviews with Sanders\u2019 aides and surrogates, they\u2019re betting that his performance at next week\u2019s debate and on the campaign trail will show he still has the stamina to run for and serve as president.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cWarren stands by account of being pushed out of her first teaching job because of pregnancy,\u201d by CBS\u2019 Zak Hudak and Bo Erickson: \u201cOn the campaign trail, Elizabeth Warren often tells the story of how she was fired from her first teaching job in 1971 because she was pregnant, a pivotal moment that ultimately put her on a path to Harvard, the United States Senate, and quite possibly the presidency. But recently, several media outlets have questioned the veracity of these claims.\n\n\u201cIn an exclusive interview with CBS News on Monday evening, Warren said she stands by her characterizations of why she left the job.\n\n\u201c\u2018All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,\u2019 she said.\u201d CBS\n\nTRUMP\u2019S TUESDAY -- The president is having lunch with VP MIke Pence at 1 p.m. in the private dining room.

He\u2019s attacked individual reporters by name. He rails frequently against press accounts of his administration, dismissing them as \u2018fake news.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut privately, the president is so obsessed with the leaks about him that he has frequently discussed whether to order polygraphs of White House staffers after major disclosures, according to four former White House officials \u2014 in what would be a stark and politically risky departure from past practice.\n\n\u201cTrump has talked about ordering polygraphs \u2018constantly\u2019 when anything major has leaked, according to a former White House official. \u2018He talked about it a lot,\u2019 said the former official.

The decision by the Commerce Department to add the firms to its \u2018entity list\u2019 alongside telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co.\u2014which was added in May\u2014means suppliers will be barred from providing technology that originates in the U.S. to the Chinese firms without a license.\n\n\u201cThe newly identified entities \u2018have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups\u2019 in northwest China\u2019s Xinjiang region, the Commerce Department said.\u201d WSJ\n\nICYMI -- \u201cRep. Engel Blasts Trump Administration\u2019s Potential Plans to Pull Out of Open Skies Treaty,\u201d by The Daily Beast\u2019s Audrey McNamara: \u201cHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel on Monday expressed his alarm over the Trump administration\u2019s potential plans to pull out of the Open Skies Treaty, a post-Cold War agreement that allows countries to operate reconnaissance flights over other nations and collect data on military activities with the aim of building trust between countries.\n\n\u201cSince coming into force in 2002, the treaty has become a key tool for the U.S. and its European allies to monitor Russian military deployments to former Soviet satellite countries, including Russian aggression in Ukraine.

Whether it be the wholesale elimination and prohibition of private insurance and imposition of socialized medicine in the form of Sen. Sanders\u2019 $32 trillion Medicare for All plan, or Speaker Pelosi\u2019s glidepath toward the same goal with her prescription drug pricing plan, these misguided proposals pose grave threats to the quality and availability of every single Americans\u2019 health care, to the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow, and to our nation\u2019s economy. Single payer health care schemes and drug price controls have been tried abroad with the same results: access restrictions for patients, decisions made by bureaucrats rather than patients and doctors, stifled innovation, and crippling taxes. This is not the policy prescription for health care in America.
