It clearly won O\u2019Rourke some fans: At the mention of weed, the entrepreneur Andrew Yang, another Democratic presidential candidate, yelled across the stage, \u201cPREACH, Beto.\u201d (And thereby perhaps underscored O\u2019Rourke\u2019s famed youth-pastor energy.) O\u2019Rourke was also in line with the majority of American voters\u2014two-thirds of whom also support legalizing marijuana\u2014as well as the majority of Democratic candidates for president. Joe Biden, the former vice president, whose stance on marijuana is the most conservative of the bunch, has called merely for decriminalizing the substance.\n\nPutting forth marijuana as a solution for chronic pain stands to differentiate O\u2019Rourke, whose campaign has been flagging in recent months. The other candidates mostly focused on putting pharmaceutical executives who have peddled opioids in jail. That\u2019s all well and just, Beto seemed to say, but marijuana could help replace those awful opioids we\u2019re trying to get rid of.", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate promoted a substitute for opioids that might be more dream than reality.", "authors": ["Olga Khazan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19289060992417/facebook.jpg?1571195804", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
