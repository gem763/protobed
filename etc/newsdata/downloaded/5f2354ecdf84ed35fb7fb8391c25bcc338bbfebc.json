For us it was a great match in terms of tactical, physical and getting challenged in all departments.\n\n\u201cMentally ... the build-up during the week, the enormousness of the game, the physicality and speed. You know if you play the All Blacks and you make two errors, it is 14 points (against you), so it was nice to play in a game like that where there is so much pressure.\u201d\n\nThe Boks are next in action against minnow neighbours Namibia in Toyota City on Sept. 28 and have made 13 changes to their side in what is expected to be a comfortable win.\n\nFar from being down after the New Zealand loss, Nienaber said the mood in the squad has been one of steely determination.\n\n\u201cWe have had an unbelievable vibe at training in terms of the intensity and the things we wanted to fix. Our system will develop and New Zealand opened up something in the way they attacked and their style of play that we have to work on, so it was nice to get that (challenge).\u201d\n\nThe Boks are widely expected to breeze to a bonus-point win over Namibia, which lost its opener 47-22 to Italy, but Nienaber said there are no specific targets in the game other than to put in a performance that showcases what the team has worked on in training.\n\n\u201cWe have a plan in terms of developing the squad and that will always take precedence over everything else. We are trying to develop our game across all facets - attack, defence, kicking and mental approach,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are always trying to improve, so there is no points limit, or to say, \u2018if we only concede three points that would be a good defensive performance\u2019, or \u2018if we concede 30 I will be disappointed\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe want to build our systems and the skill-set of our individual players. Seeing improvement there will be more enjoyable than whether we concede 30 points or no points.\u201d", "description": "South Africa defence coach Jacques Nienaber has warned Rugby World Cup rivals the team has emerged stronger from its opening 23-13 Pool B loss to New Zealand in Yokohama.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434061101&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0GR-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
