Does your idea of cooking involve mainly reheating pizza in the microwave? This is a safe space and you are not alone. Sometimes you just have to admit defeat, step away from the stove top and order in.\n\nHere are 7 signs you shouldn\u2019t be in a kitchen.\n\n1. Your family really doesn\u2019t want you to offer to help\n\nAre your questions of \u2018what can I do to help?\u2019 met with fearful stares and awkward silences? This is a sure sign that you\u2019re less of a help and more of a hazard in the kitchen. Make yourself useful in other ways \u2013 like topping up drinks \u2013 or just generally stay very, very far away from the kitchen.\n\n2. Forget burning food, you\u2019ve moved on to burning parts of your own body\n\nBurning food is old news, you\u2019re such a lost cause in the kitchen that now when you smell something on fire, you immediately know it\u2019s something on your person. Be it your fingers or hands, or even your hair, clearly nothing is safe when you\u2019re left to your own devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re something of a firestarter, but not in a good way\n\nFire outside in the braai? Very good. Fire inside, in the kitchen? Not so much. If you\u2019ve started so many fires indoors that your family is beginning to think you\u2019re a pyromaniac, it might be time to step away from the heat source.\n\nYou\u2019ve worked more plastic into dishes than edible ingredients\n\nPlastic enrages you. And not necessarily because you\u2019re an environmental warrior, but because you\u2019ve unintentionally melted plastic containers into food more times than you\u2019d care to admit.\n\nYou\u2019ve sacrificed a part of your body to the food gods\n\nChefs on TV make chopping an onion look so easy, but do you know what\u2019s even easier? Chopping off the tip of your finger. Yes, you hate to admit it, but your knife has seen more blood than a surgeon\u2019s blade, and you\u2019ve certainly shed a fair amount of blood, sweat and tears while trying to cook something.\n\nYou\u2019ve felt chilli in places that no human should ever have to feel it\n\n\n\nChilli truly is one of life\u2019s greatest aromatics. That clean, continuous spice is something we all crave at one time or another. Except that time you decided to freshly chop some for your dinner and stupidly forgot to wash your hands extremely carefully and, after a trip to the loo, that chilli became the gift that kept on giving for a very long time.\n\nYour microwave has been the cause of more explosions than the world\u2019s largest nuclear site\n\nYou may have (ahem, finally) figured out that metal is very bad in microwaves, but that doesn\u2019t prevent you from starting small nuclear explosions on a regular basis. While you\u2019ve stopped microwaving metal bowls, you\u2019ve also learned the hard way that closed Tupperware, glass and even potatoes can become dangerous weapons when placed in the microwave. Do yourself, and others around you, a favour \u2013 just step away from the microwave.\n\nIf some (or all) of these sound like you, you\u2019re not alone and you shouldn\u2019t worry. We all have different talents and cooking just isn\u2019t yours, so next time you\u2019re faced with a hungry belly, step away from the oven and call Mr D Foodinstead.", "description": "Brought to you by Mr D Food.", "authors": ["Jess Spiro"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9500/c3b57750b5084004992b78fea132a559.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
