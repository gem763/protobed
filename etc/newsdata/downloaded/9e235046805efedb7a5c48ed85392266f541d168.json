Only 17 countries now recognise Taiwan.\n\nSolomons lawmaker Peter Shanel Agovaka told a parliamentary committee that after four decades of independence and a long-term alliance with Taiwan, it was time to make a change.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sit for the next 40 years with our friends Taiwan. It is time that we make new friends - it\u2019s time that we should move on with our life,\u201d Agovaka said on Wednesday, according to a recording of the meeting in the capital Honiara.\n\n\u201cOur new relationship will deal with a One China policy; a One China policy that recognises only Beijing as the official government administration,\u201d he said in the recording, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.\n\nThe meeting was open to the public, but the recording has not been broadcast.\n\nAgovaka is a senior minister and leader of a government team convened recently to speak directly with Beijing.\n\nThe government is waiting for a task force report on the issue before it formally decides on a switch to Beijing.\n\nThe task force is dominated by lawmakers who support a diplomatic change, two political sources with direct knowledge of the issue told Reuters.\n\nChina and Taiwan have fought a tug-of-war for diplomatic recognition in the South Pacific for decades, with some island nations switching allegiances for financial gain.\n\nThe South Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where formal ties with six of the 16 island nations make up more than a third of its total alliances.\n\nCommenting during a regular daily news conference in Beijing, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang would only say that China was willing to have relations with all countries on the basis of the \u201cone China\u201d principle. That refers to China\u2019s stance that Taiwan and it both belong to one China.\n\nTaiwan said it is watching developments in the Solomons.\n\n\u201cRelationship with Solomon Islands currently is stable, but we are closely monitoring the situation and development,\u201d said Joanne Ou, spokeswoman for Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry.\n\nSolomon Islands has been assessing its Taiwan alliance since new Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare took control after a general election in April and started looking for ways to improve the country\u2019s economic prospects.\n\nThe former British protectorate, an archipelago of just over 600,000 people, relies on timber exports to generate income.\n\nThe Solomons have recognised Taiwan since 1983. It is the largest of the Taiwan-aligned Pacific countries, with access to the airfields and deepwater ports dating back to World War Two.\n\nTAIWAN SUPPORT\n\nA diplomatic shift threatens to divide the island nation.\n\nSixteen MPs have cited potential \u201ccompromised freedoms\u201d as a reason against the switch in an open letter last month, while the country\u2019s university student population is largely backing Taiwan.\n\nAn observer at the committee hearings told Reuters there would be push-back against a switch, though it was not clear if there were options to block the government\u2019s desire for change.\n\n\u201cThe government is trying to make a relationship with China now, but to formalise it we need to wait for the report,\u201d the observer said.\n\nAnti-graft agency Transparency Solomon Islands has urged caution in changing ties over concerns that the Solomons will not be able to hold firm against Beijing\u2019s interests.\n\nChina is offering to bankroll a development fund for the Solomons to help with a transition away from Taiwan, which currently provides an annual $8.5 million contribution to the island nation.\n\nJohn Moffat Fugui, a Solomons\u2019 parliamentarian and head of the task force evaluating diplomatic ties, said on Wednesday that Beijing would pay into a fund even though it usually preferred \u201cgrants, concessionary loans and sometimes gifts\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut for you, we will give you a [Rural Constituency Development Fund] for a certain period,\u201d Fugui said, referring to recent negotiations with Beijing officials.\n\nThe Lowy Institute said in a report last month that Canberra and Washington are concerned about the Solomons switching recognition to Beijing.\n\n\u201cA switch by any one (of the states that recognise Taiwan) may stimulate others\u201d to abandon Taipei, the Australia-based think-tank said.\n\nThe number of nations recognising Taiwan has been dwindling, with El Salvador in Central America, Burkina Faso in West Africa and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean, all switching to China last year.\n\nGraphic: Tug of war in the Pacific tmsnrt.rs/2MEUkvi", "description": "The Solomon Islands intends to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and align itself with Beijing, the leader of a high-level government team representing the South Pacific archipelago has said.", "authors": ["Jonathan Barrett", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426444515&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840HS", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
