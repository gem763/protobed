I don\u2019t think that we have this big problem like, for example, England do.\n\n\u201cI would like to focus on football because at the end of the day we\u2019re all civilised Europeans and we\u2019re all working for this sport and that\u2019s all the matters.\u201d\n\nAsked to clarify his remark on England, Balakov said: \u201cWhat I meant was that in the Bulgarian championship we\u2019ve not had such problems.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been incidents in various levels of English football involving racism, which I consider something normal because it\u2019s a big country with a very diverse population.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t have this problem in Bulgaria, I can assure you of that.\u201d\n\nSouthgate has repeatedly said that England need to get their own house in order and recently referenced the racist abuse at the National League clash between Hartlepool and Dover.\n\nPushed on whether England players have anything to be worried about, Balakov said: \u201cOnce again, it\u2019s not an issue that has happened recently in the national team games, meaning racist chants or whatever.\n\n\u201cI would once again advise people to think and talk about football because this is the reason why we\u2019re actually here. And we should not discuss something that has not even happened yet.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Bulgaria\u00a0manager Krasimir Balakov believes English football has a bigger problem with racism than they do.
