We would have taken that directly to get finality on those decisions.''\n\nConstruction at the Trans Mountain tank farm in Burnaby, B.C., in June 2019. (Ben Nelms/CBC)\n\nThe inability to get pipelines built has become a major source of frustration and anger in Alberta, where politicians from all parties believe other jurisdictions and communities are deliberately landlocking Alberta oil, harming its economy.\n\nThe Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, in particular, has been hit by court challenges from provincial and municipal governments, Indigenous communities and environmental groups.\n\nIndigenous communities and environmental groups challenged federal approval of the expansion and won in a federal Court of Appeal case. After the federal government re-did consultations and approved the project again last spring, the same groups filed new objections. The court has agreed to hear Indigenous complaints, but rejected those brought by others.\n\nThose cases could eventually make their way to the Supreme Court.\n\nConstruction at the Trans Mountain tank farm in Burnaby, B.C., in June 2019. (Ben Nelms/CBC)\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to hear an appeal early next year from the British Columbia government of a B.C. Court of Appeal opinion that the province couldn't restrict what flows through the pipeline, which is considered federal jurisdiction because it crosses provincial borders.\n\nThe B.C. case was seen as the final nail in the coffin for former pipeline owner Kinder Morgan's plans to proceed with the project.\n\nShortly afterwards, Kinder Morgan told the Liberals it was suspending work until the company had the government's guarantee the expansion would go ahead. When the company remained unconvinced in May 2018, the Liberal government stepped in and bought the pipeline for $4.5 billion.\n\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau said the plan was to buy the pipeline, get through all the hurdles to the expansion, and then sell it to a private backer.\n\nScheer said Wednesday that in many cases the courts found the Liberal government hadn't properly consulted Indigenous communities \u2014 even though the courts have made such findings about both Liberal and Conservative governments.\n\nThe Court of Appeal's 2016 decision to overturn federal approval of the Northern Gateway pipeline was based on a finding of faulty consultations and reviews done by the former Conservative government.\n\nThe same court's decision on Trans Mountain, in August 2018, related to a review process done partly by the former Conservative government and partly by the Liberals.", "description": "A Conservative government would overcome legal objections to building new petroleum pipelines by fast-tracking any cases right to the Supreme Court, party leader Andrew\u00a0Scheer\u00a0says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5289488.1568900204!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20190914-sept-14-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
