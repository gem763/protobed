Here we take a closer look at three of the stocks recently upgraded by Revich. \u201cWe were negative on the [rental] end market since April 2018,\u201d he commented, but \u201cwe now have more Buys than Sells across our Machinery & Diversified Industrials coverage.\u201d\n\nEncouragingly, other analysts appear to share this bullish outlook on these three stocks- as reflected in the Strong Buy Street consensus and sizable upside potential for each stock covered below. Let\u2019s dive in now:\n\nUnited Rentals, Inc.\n\nOne stock now on Goldman\u2019s buy list is rental giant United Rentals (URI \u2013 Get Report). The company claims about 13% of the North American market share. Although the stock is down 26% on a one-year basis, since the beginning of the year shares have surged 23%. Now Goldman Sachs analyst Jerry Revich has upgraded URI to Buy from Hold, while raising his 12-month price target for the shares to $165 from $128. This new price target suggests 30% upside potential lies ahead.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate investor concerns around weak used equipment values, declining construction equipment backlogs, and elevated dealer new equipment inventories,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, we believe the second derivative for the oversupply picture is turning.\u201d In other words, things are getting worse at a slower rate. As a result, Revich believes URI\u2019s cyclical risk/reward is improving- and he is also optimistic about the focus on reducing financial leverage and \"continued progress\" on reducing per unit operating costs.\n\nGoldman Sachs isn\u2019t the only firm making bullish moves on URI right now. Top Citigroup analyst Timothy Thein has just added the stock to Citi\u2019s Focus List of best ideas. With a $160 price target, the analyst believes United Rental offers a \"compelling\" risk/reward right now. URI should become less volatile going forward says Thein, as: 1) the company generates significant cash throughout the cycle; and 2) it has meaningfully improved its balance sheet.\n\nIn fact, if we look at the overall analyst consensus it comes out at a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy. But if we zero in on ratings from only best-performing analysts, the consensus shifts to Strong Buy. That\u2019s with an average analyst price target of $154 (22% upside potential).\n\nHerc Holdings Inc\n\nHerc Holdings (HRI \u2013 Get Report) is one of the largest equipment rental companies in North America. And the stock is buzzing right now. Shares surged 8% on Friday after Goldman\u2019s Revich double-upgraded HRI from Sell to Buy. He also significantly increased his price target from just $37 all the way to $60. Revich cited the company's operational turnaround for his new bullish rating, including a shift towards higher return product lines.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Goldman Sachs is highlighting an intriguing industry for investors looking for compelling stock picks in the current climate. \u201cWe believe [U.S.] construction equipment supply has peaked [and] rental rates are likely to bottom in coming quarters,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Jerry Revich wrote in a research report", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3vlWwEbYudsFdBtg.5lSfA--~B/aD0zODk7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/2b9f29bee97939ecc3d9ace6e3c18f68", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
