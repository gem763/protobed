USA TODAY\n\nDemocratic candidate Elizabeth Warren's story about being fired because she was pregnant is the kind of thing that used to happen all the time.\n\nI know this seems wild. But it's true: I'm 44, and within my lifetime, it was legal to fire women because they were pregnant.\n\nIt's difficult to imagine. But a few short decades ago, it was an unquestioned reality that pregnant women didn't belong at work, a conjunction of cultural norms that strictly defined women's priorities as domestic, regardless of the circumstances of that woman's life. And in some workplaces, because of even harder-to-understand ideas about sex.\n\nMy mother is 87, and she taught school in the 1950s, one of few professional options for women who wanted or needed to work. At the schools where my mother taught, she told me, it was simply understood that you wouldn't be able to keep teaching while pregnant, and the same norms applied in other professions.\n\nFiring pregnant women was normal\n\nWhy are we talking about this now? Because some media reports have questioned a story Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren tells on the campaign trail, about being \"shown the door\" at her first teaching job in 1971 after becoming pregnant with her first child. Some outlets have dug up school board meeting minutes that show Warren's contract was extended (Warren says that happened before she revealed her pregnancy), and a politely phrased district announcement of her departure as evidence that this story just can't be true.\n\nPolicies make some choices easier:: I shouldn't have had to fight to be a stay-at-home mom. We need family-friendly policies.\n\nBut that's kind of the point, my mother said. Firing a pregnant woman wasn't an extreme or objectionable act.\n\n\"They didn\u2019t want pregnant women in the classroom,\" she said. For folks who lived through this era, that was as clear as it was unremarkable.\n\n\"When someone suddenly was missing during the school year, or the word came out that this year that so-and-so wouldn\u2019t be back, it was because she was pregnant,\" my mother said. \"I\u2019m quite sure they didn\u2019t say 'Now that you\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re being fired.'\"\n\nThings hadn't changed much by 1971.\n\nPrivate vs. public spaces\n\n\"In the late 1960s and 1970s, you have all this legislation pouring out that\u2019s trying to address political equality, social equality, economic equality, but you still haven\u2019t dislodged all these unwritten norms that try to nudge people into behaving in a certain way,\" said Janine Lanza, an associate professor of history at Wayne State University.\n\nAnd most of these norms were aimed at constraining the agency women could exercise, whether in the workplace or with regard to their own sexuality.\n\nTreatment is out of reach for most: As a new mom, postpartum depression made the most wonderful time of my life also the worst\n\n\"They didn\u2019t have to write it down. It would be a very clear subtext of this conversation that if she was pregnant, her place was to be at home with the child, and not in the workplace. That was the assumption.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Los Angeles on October 10, 2019.

But it was also dicey for married women, particularly women who taught young children, during an era in which most couples on television were shown sleeping in separate beds, and a ground-breaking episode of \"I Love Lucy\" written to accommodate star Lucille Ball's second pregnancy couldn't use the word \"pregnant,\" considered too vulgar for the airwaves.\n\n\"Pregnancy would have brought up the question of sex, and at that point there were no sex ed classes, none of that,\" my mother said. \"They didn\u2019t want married women flaunting their marriages by being pregnant. They really didn\u2019t want the word 'sex' ever mentioned.\n\n\"It was weird. It wasn\u2019t as horrible as the Victorian age. But there were a lot of holdovers.\"\n\nAfter the U.S. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, women who had lost or were at risk of losing a job because of pregnancy had some legal resource.\n\nIn a way, I suppose it's good that things have changed so much \u2014 that an absolute fact of life for women a half-century ago is so outrageous now that we struggle to grasp it.\n\nBut it's also true that in some ways, we're still laboring under the assumption that men belong in public life, and that women are there on tolerance.\n\nThat's why female candidates like Warren have to defend their own stories. And why it's so important not to let the bad old days fade from memory.\n\nNancy Kaffer is a columnist for the Detroit Free Press, where this column originally appeared.
