Watch the performance live on @mtv this Sunday November 3rd #mtvema.\u2019\n\nLiam being Liam, the singer shared the news in the most casual way possible, reposting the image on Twitter with his standard: \u2018LG x.\u2019\n\nOh Liam, never change.\n\nThe 47-year-old is also nominated for the Best Rock award, but it is his position as the winner of the inaugural Rock Icon accolade that is sure to sit best with him \u2013 especially as it means that he won the award before his estranged brother Noel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it seems like Liam is taking a well deserved break from beefing with his older brother (at least for now) in order to *checks notes* fight Robbie Williams.\n\nYep, you heard that right.\n\nThe Rock DJ singer earlier this week challenged Liam to a pro-boxing battle, claiming that the pair could \u2018trounce\u2019 YouTube-stars-turned-boxers Logan Paul and KSI.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d love it. But I\u2019d want it to be a professional fight. I\u2019ve just seen how much KSI and Logan Paul made from their fight and I think we could trounce that,\u2019 Robbie said.\n\n\u2018But, yeah, I think last time in the noughties Liam wanted to go down to an abandoned railway track or something.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to do that. It\u2019s got to be f**king whistles and bells if it happens\u2026 Liam and I would be a wonderful thing.\u2019\n\nSee, this is what hanging out with Tyson Fury does to you\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
