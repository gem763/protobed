We goofed. Tried a new menu item today at lunch and we hear it was not a winner! Going forward, we will gather input from our students on new menu options. Thanks for the feedback!\u201d\n\nMany parents were further outraged by the apology, feeling that it lacked seriousness.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Oops we goofed\u2019 response is condescending and ridiculous,\u201d one person commented. \u201cNo sensible person could have looked at that and thought that a \u2018new\u2019 menu item. At least be honest at what it was.\u201d\n\nAnother parent added that she opts to have her children eat at school to \u201cbudget\u201d but she expected more.\n\n\u201c'Oops we goofed'? You knew what you were doing and the lack of care going into the children's meals. When I was in school I completely relied on my at school meal to get by, I'm so grateful that was before they started doing things like this.
