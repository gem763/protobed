When the mind gravitates to the worst-case scenario, the years suggest that it rarely arrives. Experience teaches the brain to stave off its tendency to catastrophize. This is the wisdom that a parent whispers into a child\u2019s ear after a nightmare. Everything will be alright.\n\n\n\nSixteen-year-old Greta Thunberg, the Scandinavian climate activist in fleece and braids, decries this adult capacity to self-soothe. Grown-ups claim to have a monopoly on realism\u2014to possess a superior capacity for assessing risk\u2014but it\u2019s precisely that supposed realism which has led them to delusion. With their rationalizations, and their armor against anxiety, they have failed to grasp the greatest threat of them all, the warming of the planet. Although Thunberg\u2019s voice remains a jarring monotone, her words betray her anger: \u201cAdults keep saying we owe it to the young people to give them hope. But I don't want your hope, I don't want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic, I want you to feel the fear I feel every day.\u201d\n\nI know the tendency she decries. When I think about climate change, my mind loops in the direction of hope. It generates a thousand reasons to feel reassured. Humans have an incredible capacity to innovate and to band together in the face of crisis, I tell myself\u2014and then order another hamburger.\n\nWatching Thunberg address panels at the United Nations and lecture European parliaments, the inversion of roles is striking. The child\u2014she looks younger than 16\u2014has assumed the authoritative posture of the adult. But she\u2019s not an understanding New Age parent, trained in the Dr. Spock school of big-hearted moms and dad. Thunberg is a severe and unforgiving moralist. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit around waiting for hope to come. You\u2019re acting like spoiled irresponsible children,\u201d she told the European Economic and Social Committee. She ordered her audience to do its homework, chastising it for failing to read a United Nations report.\n\nOn the eve of Thunberg\u2019s arrival in the United States, I bought a collection of her speeches\u2014No One is Too Small To Make A Difference\u2014recently published by Penguin. They rank among the most bracing rhetorical pieces of our time. Yet there\u2019s not a single soaring sentence in the anthology. It\u2019s a bit like reading a Barack Obama speech turned inside out. Politicians sprinkle addresses with the aspirational, and usually phony, pronouns \u201cus\u201d and \u201cwe.\u201d Thunberg relies on the accusatory second person. \u201cYou say nothing in life is black or white but that is a lie, a very dangerous lie.\u201d Or, \u201cI don't believe for one second that you will rise to that challenge.\u201d Where politicians and preachers hug the audience, she slaps it. What makes her style so effective and unnerving is that it comes from another age. Her vision of apocalypse is biblical and so is her moral framework.\n\nIn her telling, she cannot help but speak in such unvarnished tones. Her biographical explanation for her raw truth-telling has the trappings of myth. At the age of eleven, she fell into the dark hole of depression. \u201cI stopped talking and I stopped eating. In two months I lost about 10 kilos of weight.\u201d She was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and selective mutism. \u201cThat basically means I only speak when I think it is necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cNow is one of those moments.\u201d\n\nBeyond biology, what prodded her to begin her Friday school strikes were the students who survived the Parkland massacre, suggesting a pattern that is both inspiring and depressing. Where adult politicians have failed to provide moral leadership, children have been impressed into service. (See also: Malala Yousafzai.) They struggle against the charge that they are someone else\u2019s puppets, the suspicion that in the distance a gray-head pulls the strings. But that cynical charge is both cruel and wildly unpersuasive in Thunberg\u2019s case, given that her planned addresses so unmistakably track the rhythms of her conversational speech.\n\nMy 14-year-old daughter has been inspired by Thunberg to strike today, skipping classes to head to protests in downtown Washington, D.C. She also has suffered bouts of anxiety, and I long to build a sea wall that can protect her from her fears. But her example, and Thunberg\u2019s doomsaying, have made me realize that my parental desire to calm is the stuff of childish fantasy; anxiety is the mature response. To protect our children, we need to embrace their despair.", "description": "Teen activist Greta Thunberg has taken on anxieties far beyond her years.
