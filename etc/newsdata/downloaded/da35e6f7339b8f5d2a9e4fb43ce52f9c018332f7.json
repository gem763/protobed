It is already the fourth largest object in the asteroid belt after other objects Ceres, Vesta and Pallas.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It orbits around the Sun, is not a moon or satellite of another planet \u2013 but unlike a full planet, it has not cleared space around its orbit.\n\nThe new observations suggest that it satisfies the fourth and final requirement. Scientists say that a dwarf planet must have enough mass that gravity pulls it into a sphere, which the new images show are the case.\n\n\u201cThanks to the unique capability of the Sphere instrument on the VLT, which is one of the most powerful imaging systems in the world, we could resolve Hygiea\u2019s shape, which turns out to be nearly spherical,\u201d lead researcher Pierre Vernazza from the Laboratoire d\u2019Astrophysique de Marseille in France said in a statement. \u201cThanks to these images, Hygiea may be reclassified as a dwarf planet, so far the smallest in the Solar System.\u201d\n\nOther observations allowed the researchers to learn more about Hygiea\u2019s size, and determine it is just bigger than 430km in diameter. That would make it a relatively small object among its fellow dwarf planets: Pluto, which was famously downgraded, has a diameter of 2,400km, and Ceres is 950km across.\n\nAstronomers expected to be able to see a huge crater across the surface of Hygiea, since it is thought to have been involved in a collision that gave birth to almost 7,000 asteroids that are part of the same family. But despite surveying 95 per cent of the object\u2019s surface, they saw nothing that looked like evidence of that collision.\n\n\u201cThis result came as a real surprise as we were expecting the presence of a large impact basin, as is the case on Vesta,\u201d said Mr Vernazza.\n\nInstead, astronomers think the family of asteroids will have been formed during a collision with a big projectile, about two billion years ago. That would have completely shattered the asteroids\u2019 parent, with the pieces eventually reassembling and giving Hygiea its round shape as well as forming its thousands of siblings.\n\n\u201cSuch a collision between two large bodies in the asteroid belt is unique in the last 3-4 billion years,\u201d said Pavel Sevecek, a PhD student at the Astronomical Institute of Charles University, who also participated in the study.", "description": "A rock at the far reaches of our solar system might actually be a dwarf planet, scientists have said.
