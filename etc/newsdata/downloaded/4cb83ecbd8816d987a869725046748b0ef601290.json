They are said to have been rejected by multiple co-op boards due to Neumann's outlandish behavior\n\nIn total, three buildings are said to have rejected the couple with one saying that Neumann 'need not apply'.

There was never any thought of the Neumanns living there, nor a discussion with anybody about them applying.'\n\nThis is not the first time that Neumann has been reported making extravagant real estate purchases.\n\nIn 2016, he bought the Linden Farm estate in Westchester for an estimated $22million and was said to be interested in a $39million Upper East Side penthouse, reported the New York Post.\n\nNeumann stepped down as CEO of WeWork, the communal office-space company he founded, last week.\n\nWeWork leases buildings and divides them into office spaces to sublet to members, which include small businesses, start-ups and freelancers who can't afford permanent office space.\n\nBut with location operating expenses - mostly rent - amounting to some 80 percent of revenue, it has been heavily reliant on cash infusions from its private investors.\n\nNeumann, who has been known to buy other expensive real estate, has denied the allegations. Pictured: Neumann and Rebekah (then his girlfriend) at AnOther Magazine and Hudson Jeans Dinner in New York, September 2009\n\nLast week, Neumann stepped down as the CEO of WeWork, which he founded, among controversy over the delay of the company's IPO\n\nThe company was initially valued at $47 billion, but Wall Street began raising questions after the company delayed a planned IPO earlier this month.\n\nWeWork's revenue rose sharply to $1.8billion in 2018, but the company lost $1.6billion the same year.\n\nAdding to its problems have been concerns about Neumann's behavior. He used some of his WeWork stock to secure a $500million personal loan prior to the IPO.\n\nAnther issue? Neumann has bought properties and leased them back to WeWork, making him millions of dollars.\n\nPage Six also reports that Neumann allegedly wanted to build a WeWork office space on Mars.\n\nNeumann is said to have banned his employees from expensing meals to their corporate accounts if any of the dishes included meat.\n\nHe remains on the board as non-executive chairman while the CEO title has been split between two people: Artie Minson, formerly co-president and chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, formerly vice chairman.", "description": "Adam Neumann and his wife, Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, were reportedly rejected the co-op boards of three buildings on Fifth Avenue with one writing to their broke that Neumann 'need not apply'.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19305180-0-image-a-58_1570205249950.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
