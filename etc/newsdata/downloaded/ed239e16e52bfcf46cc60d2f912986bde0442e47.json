Thousands of spectators waved Chinese flags and fighter jets flew low overhead.\n\n\u201cNo force can shake the status of our great motherland, and no force can stop the progress of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation,\u201d Xi, wearing a gray Mao jacket, said in a nationally televised speech.\n\nXi was joined on the Tiananmen rostrum by Chinese leaders including Premier Li Keqiang and former Presidents Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin.\n\nThe event marks the anniversary of the Oct. 1, 1949, announcement of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China by then-leader Mao Zedong following a civil war. Invoking Mao\u2019s memory, Xi made his speech Tuesday on the same spot as the former leader\u2019s 1949 declaration.\n\nXi, who is chairman of the body that commands the ruling party\u2019s military wing, the People\u2019s Liberation Army, rode in an open-topped limousine past dozens of rows of truck-mounted missiles, armored personnel carriers and other military gear.\n\nSoldiers in helmets and combat gear shouted, \u201cHello, leader!\u201d and \u201cServe the people!\u201d Xi replied, \u201cHello, comrades.\u201d\n\nA formation of fighter jets trailing colored smoke and led by a plane with a radar dish flew low over the capital as Xi waved to the pilots from the ground.\n\nThe event highlighted rapidly developing Chinese weapons technology that foreign analysts say is close to matching the United States, Russia and Europe in missiles, drones and some other fields.\n\nThe PLA, the world\u2019s biggest military with 2 million men and women in uniform, also is working on fighter planes, the first Chinese-built aircraft carrier and a new generation of nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nOne of the most closely-watched weapons unveiled Tuesday was the Dongfeng-17, a nuclear-capable glider that foreign analysts say is designed to maneuver at high speed to evade anti-missile defenses.\n\nAnother missile displayed, the Dongfeng-41, is believed to have a range of up to 15,000 kilometers (9,400 miles), which would make it world\u2019s longest-range military missile. Analysts say it may be able to carry as many as 10 warheads to hit separate targets.\n\nThe party\u2019s emphasis on missiles and other long-range weapons reflects Beijing\u2019s desire to displace the United States as the region\u2019s dominant force and enforce claims to Taiwan, the South China Sea and other disputed territories.\n\nThe PLA had the world\u2019s second-highest military spending at an estimated $250 billion last year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The United States, with a force of 1.3 million people, led in spending at $650 billion last year, or more than 2 times China\u2019s level.\n\nChina has about 280 nuclear warheads, compared with 6,450 for the United States and 6,850 for Russia, according to SIPRI. Beijing says it wants a \u201cminimum credible nuclear deterrent\u201d but won\u2019t be the first to use atomic weapons in a conflict.\n\nChina has developed military abilities \u201cthat can reach potential adversaries across the globe,\u201d the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said in a report in January.\n\nTuesday\u2019s celebration comes as Xi\u2019s government faces economic and political challenges, but the ruling party\u2019s hold on power appears to be secure three decades after it crushed pro-democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square.\n\nBeijing is trying to shore up cooling economic growth and prevent politically dangerous job losses amid a tariff war with Washington over trade and technology, a dispute that has battered Chinese exporters.\n\nThe party faces anti-government protests in Hong Kong that have embarrassed Beijing ahead of its highest-profile political event of the year. Despite that, Xi promised in a speech Monday to stick to official commitments to let Hong Kong manage its own affairs despite the unrest.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam attended Tuesday\u2019s parade in Beijng, accompanied by dozens of Hong Kong officials and dignitaries in a show of unity with the ruling party.\n\nParamilitary policy maintained a strong presence Tuesday in Shenzhen, the mainland city that abuts Hong Kong. Dozens of armored personnel carriers and other vehicles of the People\u2019s Armed Police were parked outside a stadium as authorities prepared for an evening fireworks display.\n\nAlso Tuesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un praised his country\u2019s decades-long ties with Beijing in a congratulatory message to Xi and said Pyongyang would stand by China in \u201cdefending and glorifying socialism,\u201d according to the North\u2019s official news agency. The two leaders have met five times amid pressure on Pyongyang to renounced nuclear weapons development.\n\nXi, the son of a commander in Mao\u2019s guerrilla army, has emerged as China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades after using a marathon anti-corruption drive to neutralize potential rivals.\n\nThe party removed constitutional limits on its term as president last year, rolling back efforts to create a consensus-based system and prevent autocratic one-man rule.\n\nIn his speech Monday, Xi reminded Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own territory, of the ruling party\u2019s pledge to unite it with the mainland, by force if necessary.\n\nBeijing is using China\u2019s status as the world\u2019s second-biggest economy as leverage to isolate Taiwan politically. China has pressured foreign retailers, airlines and other companies to identify the island and the mainland as one country on their websites. In its latest diplomatic coup, Beijing persuaded the Solomon Islands last month to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s unification with the mainland is \u201can inevitable trend\u201d and \u201d no force can ever stop it,\u201d Xi said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "China's military has shown off a new hypersonic ballistic nuclear missile believed capable of breaching all existing anti-missile shields deployed by the U.S. and its allies.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/China_70_Years_89408.jpg-91b2c_c0-215-5131-3206_s1770x1032.jpg?36a16b2f0eef6f436276e3bc779f3e4c80e4246e", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
