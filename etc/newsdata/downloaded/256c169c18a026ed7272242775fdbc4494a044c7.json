Pictured: Police at the scene where a man was stabbed to death in Cambridgeshire this week\n\nThe crime survey stats also showed a 15 per cent increase in fraud offences to a stagger 3.8million - with 2.6million of those classified as bank and credit account frauds.\n\nA total of 119 people have already suffered a violent death in London this year, but the statistics show that, in the period the statistics were gathered, the total number of homicides recorded by the police across the country fell by 5% in the last year, from 719 to 681 offences.\n\nThere has also been a 14% decrease in homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved to 248 offences, mainly driven by a drop in such incidents in London, the ONS said.\n\nThe figures, taken from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and police recorded crime statistics, show offences in the 12 months up to June 2019.\n\nThe excludes Greater Manchester Police because the force's data is not comparable due to reporting issues.\n\nJaved Khan, chief executive of charity Barnardo's, said: 'It's totally unacceptable that the knife crime crisis continues to claim so many young lives, with offences at a record high. Knife crime is a symptom of a much wider, complex problem.\n\n'Too many young people are suffering a 'poverty of hope', and facing a future with no qualifications, no job prospects, and no role models, making them vulnerable to criminal gangs who force them to deliver drugs and carry knives.'\n\nThis graph shows the number of police-recorded knife crimes (represented by the blue line) and firearms offences (represented by the yellow line) increasing in the last 12 months\n\nIn total, police recorded crime rose by 7% to more than 6 million. Excluding fraud and computer misuse offences, this stood at 5.27 million - an increase of 6%.\n\nMeanwhile, separate figures also released on Thursday show that the proportion of crimes in England and Wales resulting in a charge or summons fell to another record low of 7.4% in the 12 months to the end of June.\n\nThis meant 393,112 suspects were charged or ordered to be in court during that time, according to the Home Office data.\n\nIn almost 45% of more than 2.36 million cases, the investigation was completed but no suspect was identified. In at least 1.2 million cases (22.8%), the victim did not support further action.\n\nJoe Traynor, from the ONS Centre for Crime and Justice, said: 'While overall levels of violence have remained steady, the number of offences involving a knife has continued to increase across England and Wales.\n\n'However, the number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved decreased, driven by falls in London.\n\n'There is a mixed picture in the total number of knife crime offences across police forces with the Metropolitan Police recording little change in the last year.'", "description": "The number of offences involving a knife or sharp instrument in England and Wales rose by 7% on the previous 12 months,\u00a0figures released by the Office for National Statistics  show.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/10/19830916-0-image-a-53_1571306384420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
