With such lofty goals China has barreled full-speed ahead toward the future, and now it\u2019s starting to look like the nation\u2019s hasty growth is finally catching up with it.\n\nChina\u2019s superpower ambitions don\u2019t seem like such a far-fetched idea, considering that China is already the second-largest economy in the world and growing all the time. But for China, this comes with a massive set of challenges.\n\n\u201cChina faces a protracted and increasingly difficult struggle to secure energy and water supplies to feed its insatiable appetite. From having to sustain a population over four times that of America\u2019s 330 million, China is already at a severe disadvantage against the world\u2019s incumbent superpower,\u201d reports digital media news site SupChina. \u201cChina has only a portion of the U.S.\u2019s oil, gas, and water resources, and that gap in self-sufficiency is likely to widen further.\u201d\n\nAs China\u2019s economy expands, so too does its bottomless demand for economic inputs and primary materials. And judging from recent events, the country is already scrambling to meet energy and water demand at its current levels - which is especially concerning when you consider that these demands are set to skyrocket.\n\nRelated: One Of The World\u2019s Largest Oil Companies Just Ditched The Dollar\n\nChina relies heavily on international trade to feed its industries\u2019 energy consumption, and the Trade War with the United States, the attack on Saudi Arabian oil and its subsequent sharp decline in production, and pushback on Chinese claims to oil and gas rights in the South China Sea have all been heavy blows to China in the past months.\n\nIn another particularly unfortunate turn for China, a forecast report released by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in June reported that the country\u2019s natural gas consumption is projected to grow at nearly double the rate of Beijing\u2019s previous projections. \u201cThis came three months after the government of President X\u00ed J\u00ecnp\u00edng took the gamble to impose a 25 percent tariff on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from the United States starting June 1,\u201d reports SupChina. While China was already feeling a major energy squeeze, their own decisions in the U.S. trade war have undoubtedly made an already bad situation worse.\n\nChina is currently the world\u2019s fastest-growing importer of natural gas (not to mention the fastest-growing consumer of oil) and is the second biggest importer of liquefied natural gas in the world, following Japan.\n\nLNG has seen a huge boom across Asia in recent years and has become a particularly vital source of energy in China. \u201cNatural gas is seen as a bridge fuel between current worldwide use of much dirtier coal for power generation and industrial consumption, and renewable fuels, because it burns cleaner. It has seen massive growth in sales in recent years, particularly to Asian nations seeking to reduce their dependence on coal,\u201d reports Reuters.\n\nRelated: How Much Oil Is Up For Grabs In Syria?\n\nChina has made an effort to increase its own domestic oil and natural gas production and has even announced that it will soon ease restrictions for foreign investment in Chinese oil. As OilPrice reported in July, by the end of this year China will be \u201cderegulating and restructuring key sectors of its industry, including oil exploration and mining, in order to facilitate greater foreign investment in China.\u201d\n\nWhile China is doing its best to boost its own energy production, however, it may be too little too late. China\u2019s demand for fuel is insatiable and simply cannot be met without the massive imports that China has already become completely dependent on and will continue to rely on as the economy grows.\n\nWith instability in the Middle East, poor diplomatic relations with the United States, and a faltering domestic oil and gas industry, China needs to solve its growing energy crisis in a hurry. Even without President Xi\u2019s lofty \u201cChinese Dream\u201d ambitions, China would need to secure more and more fuel just to support its growing population. When you factor in the nation\u2019s superpower ambitions on top of that, China is facing a serious squeeze with no real solution in sight. In the meantime, China better make sure that its relationship with LNG-rich Russia doesn\u2019t sour like so many of its other diplomatic ties.\n\nBy Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "China\u2019s superpower status is at risk as the country\u2019s energy thirst continues to grow at unprecedented levels", "authors": ["Haley Zaremba"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
