He was snapped at Watch What Happens Live in 2015 above\n\nJoe's attorney James Leonard told the appeals court that Joe hoped to 'begin working' while he was in Italy and 'contributing financially' to his wife.\n\nHe was able to have a phone conversation with Teresa and his eldest daughter Gia before departing for Rome.\n\n'Teresa is very happy and got very emotional after speaking to Joe today,' said Leonard.\n\n'He called both her and Gia from the plane. It's bittersweet, everyone is happy he is out but no one is happy he is going to Italy. He belongs with his wife and four daughters.\n\n'I met with Joe face to face a week ago at the prison in Pennsylvania,' he continued. 'This is a man who loves his family and is not done fighting by any means.

I'm their rock, they're my rock and I'm glad we have each other.'\n\nRally around the family: Teresa, snapped last week in LA, said of her daughters, 'I'm their rock, they're my rock and I'm glad we have each other'\n\nTeresa, at the same event, told ET that 'just being with [her] daughters' was helping her amid the difficult time.\n\nShe said that Joe is looking at getting involved in mixed marital arts (MMA) fighting as a new career upon his release from custody.\n\nAn insider close to his family previously told People that Joe has been losing hope of being reunited with his family in the US.\n\n'These past few months in ICE [custody] have been harder for Joe than prison was. The conditions there are terrible,' said the source. 'He\u2019s so close to freedom, yet so far away. Not being able to see his family, and knowing that he won\u2019t be able to be back home with them, has really broken him.\n\nHe\u2019s fighting, but he\u2019s really resigned to the fact that he\u2019ll be deported,' they continued. 'And losing that hope has left him bitter, angry, and unhappy. He\u2019s a shell of who he used to be.'\n\nHis deportation case returns to court next month.", "description": "The 47-year-old ex-con is headed to Rome on a flight Friday evening, according to an insider who spoke to TMZ.
