The outstanding dollar-denominated bonds are maturing in 2023 and 2033 and are worth 5.5 billion euros.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good news in the sense of returning to the [dollar] market and diversifying the investor base. Basically, with these three new bonds, we now have a [dollar yield] curve there,\u201d said UniCredit strategist Luca Cazzulani.\n\nThe head of the Treasury\u2019s debt management office Davide Iacovoni told Reuters in July that Italy was \u201cworking very intensely\u201d to issue the dollar bond before the end of this year.\n\nThe high level of investor interest in the bonds is a result of low yields in both the euro zone and U.S. bond markets, and the recent fall in perception of credit risk associated with Italy, Cazzulani said.\n\nNearly 70% of euro zone government bond yields are in negative territory. Italy accounts for most of the positive-yielding government bonds available.\n\nThe arrival of a pro-Europe government in Rome last month, replacing the previous eurosceptic coalition, has also driven down yields on Italian debt. Ten-year yields IT10YT=RR reached a record low 0.76% in early September.\n\nRome is also exploiting relaxed market conditions after the European Central Bank said in September it would resume a bond purchase scheme to boost the euro zone economy.\n\nThe five-year tranche is set to yield 105 basis points over the mid-swap rate. The 10-year tranche 150 basis points and the 30-year tranche 235 basis points, the lead manager said.\n\nThe deal \u201chighlights demand for dollar assets from certain investors that choose not to hedge some FX risk, which boosts the yield you get on the investment,\u201d said Andrey Kuznetsov, a senior portfolio manager at Hermes Investment Management in London.\n\nRather than face expensive hedging costs, some foreign investors buying dollar-denominated bonds have opted not to hedge their currency risks at all.\n\nItaly has been preparing the groundwork for this bond sale since the end of 2017, when it introduced a new system of guarantees on derivatives that make it cheaper for banks to hold a foreign currency position with Rome.", "description": "Italy raised $7 billion on Wednesday with its first U.S. dollar bond in nearly a decade, a move that helps to diversify funding sources for the world's third-biggest public debtor.", "authors": ["Yoruk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
