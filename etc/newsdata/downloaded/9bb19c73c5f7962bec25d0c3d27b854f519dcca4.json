The head of the award\u2019s committee is confident the prize can make a comeback by avoiding the \u201cmale-oriented\u201d and \u201cEurocentric\u201d perspective that has dominated judging in the past.\n\nThe Nobel prize in literature was postponed last year after a sexual abuse and financial misconduct scandal, which led to a series of resignations at the Swedish Academy, which runs the award. Jean-Claude Arnault, whose wife Katarina Frostenson was a member of the Academy until she quit in January over breaches of secrecy, was convicted of rape in October 2018 and jailed for two years.\n\nWith awards for both 2018 and 2019 set to be unveiled on Thursday, the Academy will be hoping that the Nobel\u2019s return is well-received by the global literary community. Worth 9m Swedish krona (\u00a3740,000), the prize goes to the writer who, in the words of Alfred Nobel\u2019s will, is deemed to have written \u201cthe most outstanding work in an ideal direction\u201d.\n\nThe Russian novelist Lyudmila Ulitskaya, the Guadeloupean novelist Maryse Cond\u00e9 and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale author Margaret Atwood are all believed to be in contention for this year\u2019s award, particularly after Anders Olsson, chair of the Nobel prize in literature committee, revealed how criteria this year have changed.\n\nGiven that the last two winners \u2013 Kazuo Ishiguro and Bob Dylan \u2013 both write in English and just 14 of the 114 literature laureates are women, Olsson acknowledged this week the need for the jury to \u201cwiden our perspective\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe had a more Eurocentric perspective on literature and now we are looking all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cPreviously it was much more male-oriented. Now we have so many female writers who are really great, so we hope the prize and the whole process of the prize has been intensified and is much broader in its scope.\u201d\n\nOther names seen as strong contenders include Hungarian novelist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai and Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk, as well as perennial candidates Haruki Murakami and Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o.\n\n\u201cIf there are going to be two [laureates], one has to be a woman.\u201d said Fiammetta Rocco, culture correspondent at the Economist and the administrator of the International Booker prize, adding that \u201cthey\u2019re likely to be from different continents\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The grand queen, the empress, of Caribbean literature\u2019 ... Maryse Cond\u00e9.

And in eastern Europe both Krasznahorkai and Tokarczuk would be on anybody\u2019s list.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rocco, the exiled Chinese writer Ma Jian is also in the frame, alongside the Argentine C\u00e9sar Aira and the South African author Antjie Krog, \u201cpart journalist, part broadcaster, part playwright, part poet \u2013 a great chronicler of the transition from apartheid to black majority rule and what it meant\u201d.\n\nAn author writing in English would be an \u201cunlikely\u201d prospect, Rocco added. \u201cBut our own Neil Gaiman would be amazing. And I think anybody who\u2019s making a list would put Margaret Atwood on it.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish-Greek journalist and author Alexandra Pascalidou, who last year helped found the one-off New Academy prize in literature \u2013 won by Cond\u00e9 \u2013 to fill the void left by the Nobel, was also keen to see a female winner such as the \u201camazing\u201d Antiguan-American writer Jamaica Kincaid. \u201cSince the prize was founded in 1901 only 14 women have received it,\u201d she said.\n\nMaureen Freely, chair of English PEN and judge of this year\u2019s International Booker, suggested the French author Annie Ernaux \u2013 who \u201cwrites in a genre all her own, defying the unwritten rules of the novel and the memoir to create new spaces for collective reflection\u201d \u2013 and Colombian Juan Gabriel V\u00e1squez, who \u201cdefies history itself, showing its official chroniclers to be charlatans and its actors to be lost in a maze of half truths\u201d.\n\nJacques Testard of the British press Fitzcarraldo \u2013 which publishes 2015\u2019s Nobel winner Svetlana Alexievich \u2013 said it was \u201cgreat\u201d to have the Nobel back. \u201cCan Xue or Scholastique Mukasonga would be interesting choices. In Latin America I\u2019d love to see someone like Elena Poniatowska get it. Closer to home, I\u2019ll be rooting for the two authors we publish who the bookies seem to think are in with a shout: Olga Tokarczuk and Jon Fosse. And I\u2019d like to think Annie Ernaux would be a worthy winner.\u201d\n\nIt will take time to regain trust and respectability\n\nFor the Swedish Academy, Olsson is looking forward to Thursday\u2019s announcement. \u201cTwo prizes in literature, that is something exceptional,\u201d he said.\u201d\n\nPascalidou believes this is only the start of a slow rebuilding process. \u201cI think the Swedish Academy lost a lot with not only the accusations of sexual harassment and sexism, and the man who ended up in jail for rape, but also in how they handled the situation with their own members,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will take time to regain trust and respectability. The catharsis has not occurred yet. The untouchable patriarchs are still ruling but I hope they learned something after the mess they caused. It was a manmade catastrophe that punished literature.\u201d", "description": "Maryse Cond\u00e9 and Margaret Atwood among those tipped for the prize as Swedish Academy aims to restore its shattered reputation", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bc79da269adaa782b51d1c3be94d26b72cc9081/0_524_2022_1212/master/2022.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8a8ce6f9fb8d587e1c558a8ece58841", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
