If not, why would he trust the results of any investigation the Ukrainians might conduct?\n\nOnly certain kinds of countries would even accede to the kind of request President Trump and his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani made, and they are precisely the countries whose judicial systems are least trustworthy. No U.S. president could ever ask Britain or France or Japan or any other deeply rooted democracy with an impartial justice system to investigate an American whom those governments had not already decided on their own to investigate. Much less would such governments be willing to investigate a U.S. president\u2019s political opponents at the president\u2019s behest. The only kinds of countries that would conceivably succumb to such pressure \u2014 and it is to this Ukrainian president\u2019s great credit that he did not \u2014 are precisely those whose judicial systems were already corrupt and easily manipulated for political purposes. Again, how reliable could such an investigation be? Why would we not expect it to produce whatever answer was most conducive to that government\u2019s interests? The U.S. president wants an investigation to prove that his opponent is dirty. Okay. Done. He\u2019s dirty. Now release the aid.\n\nBut that is just part of the problem. Consider what it will mean if we decide that what Trump and Giuliani have already acknowledged doing in Ukraine becomes an acceptable practice for all future presidents. Sending the signal that other governments can curry favor with a U.S. president by helping to dig up dirt on his or her political opponents would open our political system and foreign policy to intervention and manipulation on a global scale. Every government in the world wishing to influence U.S. foreign policy will have an incentive to come to a sitting president with information on his or her potential political opponents.\n\nThat information might be related to investments or other financial dealings in a particular country, as in Ukraine. Or it might have to do with the behavior of a particular individual while traveling abroad \u2014 who he or she sees and what he or she does. Other governments will therefore have an incentive to conduct surveillance of political figures traveling through their countries on the off chance of gleaning some bit of information that could be traded in Washington for some favor. Nor would other governments be limited to what they can see in their own countries. They would have an incentive to dig into the lives of potential opposition politicians in the United States, through monitoring their social media and other Internet presences, their bank accounts and other personal information \u2014 as already happened in 2016, and which Trump openly welcomed then, too.\n\nToday, foreign leaders come calling with golf clubs and promises of greater market access to win a U.S. president\u2019s favor. What if they came with secret transcripts and videos, or promises of investigations? In the high-stakes game of national security, if other governments discover that one of the currencies of relations with the United States is dirt on opponents, they will do their best to arm themselves. If we legitimize this kind of behavior by a U.S. president, if no price is paid for this kind of conduct, it will be open season on the American political system.\n\nRead more:\n\nPelosi announces formal impeachment inquiry of Trump\n\nSeven freshman national-security Democrats: These allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect\n\nMike Murphy: I\u2019m a Republican.
