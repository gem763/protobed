(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWhatever chances remained of the Trump White House striking a major trade deal with the Chinese this fall appear to have left the building as the impeachment crisis walked in.\n\nThat is the rough truth confronting Trump\u2019s trade negotiators as they this week restart talks with their Beijing counterparts in Washington. The Chinese feel no compulsion to make big concessions to a besieged President Trump.\n\nAnd Trump has limited room to maneuver in the face of rising bipartisan hostility toward China on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe president appeared to acknowledge a bigger breakthrough faces long odds. \u201cI think that we\u2019ll just have to see what happens,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cI would much prefer a big deal. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for. Can something happen? I guess, maybe, who knows? But I think it\u2019s probably unlikely.\u201d\n\nA major agreement already looked remote in recent weeks. The House Democratic impeachment inquiry \u2014 and the revelations it has brought forward about Trump\u2019s dealings with China \u2014 have rendered it all but impossible. \u201cThe impeachment contagion is now in the U.S.-China bloodstream,\u201d Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group wrote in a note.\n\nThat is, while the impeachment push launched over pressure the president put on his Ukrainian counterpart to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Trump himself broadened its scope when, live on national television last week, he urged China to join the effort. The comment drew condemnation from Republican Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah), Susan Collins (Maine) and Ben Sasse (Neb.).\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) deflected a question about Trump\u2019s call for China to investigate the Bidens by arguing the president had been kidding (he didn't appear to be; here's the video). But the president refused to answer questions about whether he was joking:\n\n\"The President refused to answer repeated questions about whether he was serious or joking about asking China to investigate the Bidens,\" per pool report from cabinet meeting. \u2014 Eli Stokols (@EliStokols) October 7, 2019\n\nAnd top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said he didn't know what Trump meant. But he said there was \u201cno linkage between that and the trade talks \u2026 I guarantee there will be no linkage.\u201d\n\nTrump in June also reportedly told Chinese President Xi Jinping he would remain silent on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong while trade talks continued, per recent reporting by CNN. The unrest in Hong Kong has taken on new urgency after the NBA apologized for a tweet the Houston Rockets general manager sent backing the protesters. The basketball association\u2019s handling of the matter drew fiery responses from both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, highlighting the emerging consensus there that China is a bad actor that needs to be confronted and contained.\n\nHere, for example, was Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a Trump ally:\n\nChinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps & is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators - and NBA wants to \u201cbridge cultural divides\u201d? Cultural divides? https://t.co/d6jXQOzb5F \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 7, 2019\n\nAnd here was Sen. Elizabeth Warren:\n\nChina is trying to use its market power to silence free speech and criticism of its conduct. In response, the NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles\u2014and our values. We should all be speaking out in support of those protesting for their rights. https://t.co/IRiIY1cgDg \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nThat response offered the White House a preview of what it can expect if it tries to pass off as a game changer an agreement that doesn\u2019t include Chinese commitments to structural reforms like rolling back state subsidies and curbing its industrial policy. But that is precisely what Chinese negotiators have taken off the table before talks resume.\n\n\u201cVice Premier Liu He, who will lead the Chinese contingent in high-level talks that begin Thursday, told visiting dignitaries he would bring an offer to Washington that won\u2019t include commitments on reforming Chinese industrial policy or the government subsidies that have been the target of longstanding U.S. complaints, one of the people said,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Shawn Donnan and Jenny Leonard report.\n\nMore: \u201cThat offer would take one of the Trump administration\u2019s core demands off the table. It\u2019s emblematic of what analysts see as China\u2019s strengthening hand as the Trump administration faces an impeachment crisis -- which has recently drawn in China -- and a slowing economy blamed by businesses on the disruption caused by the president\u2019s trade wars.\u201d\n\nAnd Xi has his own pressures at home to navigate, with the Hong Kong mess chief among them. \u201cEven if China could see a basis for a deal purely on economic grounds, the domestic political situation makes it very hard for [Xi] to negotiate with a tariff gun to his head,\u201d Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 Ian Shepherdson wrote in a note. \u201cThe message that would send to rebellious Hong Kongers\u2014that Mr. Xi will cave if pushed hard enough\u2014is just too dangerous to be allowed.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration just threw some more sand in the gears by placing eight Chinese tech giants on the Commerce Department's blacklist, banning them from doing business with American companies. The administration said the Chinese firms, two of which provide video surveillance, are implicated in human rights abuses against Chinese Muslim minorities.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He shakes hands with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington earlier this year. (Reuters/Leah Millis)\n\nAnother question is whether both sides can strike a short-term detente. Such an agreement could stave off a dramatic tariff escalation Trump has pledged to impose over the next two months.\n\nTariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports are set to rise from 25 percent to 30 percent on Oct. 15 barring an agreement to delay them. And Trump has pledged to slap 15 percent duties on another $156 billion of Chinese products on Dec. 15. Added to a June tariff hike, those increases would more than double the average levy on Chinese imports, to 26.6 percent, according to a Peterson Institute analysis.\n\nBill Reinsch, who served in the Commerce Department during President Clinton\u2019s impeachment, said that process made administration aides \"reluctant to take on new fights and more inclined to settle old ones, because they had too much to deal with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat may have ticked up marginally, despite the president denying it today, is the prospect for an interim agreement,\u201d Reinsch tells me. Such a skinny deal would \u201cavoid blowback from consumers around the holidays, relieve pressure on farmers and save the real agreement for later, as long as it\u2019s called an \u2018interim deal.\u2019 I still think that\u2019s likely, and impeachment may make it more so.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

The other 11 Pacific Rim countries, including big farm producers such as New Zealand and Canada, went ahead without the United States and were enjoying preferential treatment in Japan.\u201d\n\nWhat was left out of the deal: \u201cWhile rewarding American farmers, the new U.S.-Japan mini-deal does not resolve differences over trade in autos. Trump has said the two countries continue to work on a more comprehensive agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile rewarding American farmers, the new U.S.-Japan mini-deal does not resolve differences over trade in autos. Trump has said the two countries continue to work on a more comprehensive agreement.\u201d What about Congress?: According to a previous WSJ report, the deal is so limited in scope that it does not require congressional approval.\n\n\u2014 USMCA edges toward the finish line. NYT's Carl Hulse and Emily Cochrane: \"The escalating impeachment drama between Congress and the White House that has all but doomed hopes of most legislative progress this fall has instead enhanced the prospects for approval, within weeks, of one major initiative: a sweeping new trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\n\"Top lawmakers in both parties and others closely following the talks said that substantial progress had been made in resolving the sticking points, and that a decisive House vote on the accord to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement could occur before Congress departed for Thanksgiving. The deal may be a rare bright spot in an otherwise dysfunctional dynamic that has taken hold in the capital, and it owes its progress to a coincidence of timing, productive negotiations that have unfolded behind closed doors for months and political necessity for two parties that each has distinct reasons to hope it succeeds.\"\n\nHenry Cuellar helps lobby fellow Democrats on USMCA: \u201cAs a cheerleader for USMCA, [Texas Rep.

Whether the Turkish lira will 'really be impacted' by U.S. threats will depend on a possible response by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and whether he moves forward with an invasion into Syria, said Brendan McKenna, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York.\"\n\n\u2014 Federal judge rules Trump must turn over his tax returns to Manhattan DA: \u201cA federal judge dismissed [Trump\u2019s] lawsuit seeking to block the Manhattan district attorney from obtaining the president\u2019s tax returns as part of an investigation into hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign,\u201d my colleagues David A. Fahrenthold and Ann E. Marimow report.\n\n\u201cThat decision does not mean Trump\u2019s tax returns will be handed over immediately. Trump appealed within minutes, and an appeals court put the case on hold until it can hear the president\u2019s challenge. But the ruling \u201cby U.S. Judge Victor Marrero was still a broad rejection of Trump\u2019s precedent-shattering argument in this case. The president argued that, as long as he is president, he cannot be investigated by any prosecutor, anywhere, for any reason.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Chao faces more questions over whether she favored Kentuckians: \u201cIn her first 14 months as Transportation secretary, Elaine Chao met with officials from Kentucky, which her husband Mitch McConnell represents in the Senate, vastly more often than those from any other state,\u201d Politico\u2019s Tanya Snyder, Tucker Doherty and Arren Kimbel-Sannit report.\n\n\u201cIn all, 25 percent of Chao\u2019s scheduled meetings with local officials of any state from January 2017 to March 2018 were with Kentuckians, who make up only about 1.3 percent of the U.S. population.
