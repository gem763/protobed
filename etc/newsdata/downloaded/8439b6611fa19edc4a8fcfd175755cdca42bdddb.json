In most jurisdictions it is far better equipped with tools to identify and mitigate risks arising in the banking and insurance sectors than in market based finance,\u201d Cunliffe said.\n\n\u201cThis gap needs in my view to be addressed.\u201d\n\nCunliffe said any reworking of the relationship between the BoE and Britain\u2019s finance ministry to provide more help to the economy must be handled very cautiously.\n\nResponding to questions after his speech, he also said it was too early to say that more coordination between monetary and fiscal policy was needed.\n\nEarlier on Monday the finance ministry said rules for the budget will be reviewed and that they would \u201ckeep control of our national debt\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhether and how monetary, and perhaps fiscal, frameworks should adapt to a world of structurally low interest rates is a related but separate issue which is receiving considerable attention from academic research and, more recently, policy makers in some jurisdictions,\u201d Cunliffe said.\n\n\u201cDiscussion is at a relatively early stage and these are, in my view, issues that would need a great deal of careful deliberation.\u201d\n\nOn Brexit, Cunliffe pushed back against the widespread view among economists outside the BoE that it would almost certainly be forced to cut interest rates in the event of a no-deal Brexit to help prop up demand.\n\n\u201cWhat we do doesn\u2019t always get reflected in what people think,\u201d Cunliffe said in response to a question after his speech, adding that some people had not expected the BoE would raise rates, as it has done, before any Brexit transition deal.\n\nOn Friday BoE Governor Mark Carney said it was his view that the BoE would do \u201cwhatever we can\u201d to support growth in such a Brexit outcome.", "description": "The Bank of England may need to make its main tool to smooth out swings in bank lending more powerful to combat future economic downturns if interest rates stay low for a long time, Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on Monday.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440743273&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D15B", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
