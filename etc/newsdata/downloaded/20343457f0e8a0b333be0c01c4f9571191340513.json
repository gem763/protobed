He will reportedly be back in Arizona until his Dec. 9 trial, and he's no longer allowed to practice adoption law.\n\nAn Arizona elected official has been suspended without pay after being charged with running a human smuggling operation involving more than 40 pregnant women from the Marshall Islands, the Associated Press reports.\n\nMaricopa County assessor Paul Petersen on Monday was suspended from his position for 120 days, but the county reportedly doesn\u2019t have the authority to fire him from the role \u2014 even though he\u2019ll soon be on trial for allegedly being the mastermind behind an international adoption scheme that authorities say went on for three years.\n\nPetersen, who had a side gig as an adoption lawyer, recruited pregnant women from the Marshall Islands, arranged for them to fly to Utah \u2014 where he owns a home outside Salt Lake City \u2014 and matched them with adoptive families, according to the indictment against him obtained by the Arizona Republic. He allegedly charged the families $25,000 to $40,000 per adoption.\n\nPetersen was charged earlier this month in Utah and Arizona, and indicted in Arkansas, for a litany of crimes, including human smuggling, sale of a child, forgery, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to the AP.\n\n\u201cWhile Mr. Petersen is entitled to a presumption of innocence, our investigation uncovered evidence that he has committed horrible crimes,\u201d the Utah Attorney General\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cPetersen's illegal adoption scheme exploited highly vulnerable groups in two countries \u2014 the birth mothers and families in the Marshall Islands and the adoptive parents here in Utah.\u201d\n\nAfter an audit of Petersen\u2019s office, county supervisors said he used his work computer \u2014 which he wasn\u2019t supposed to use for personal work \u2014 to conduct his adoption business. He also made several calls from his county-provided desk phone and cell phone to Arkansas, Jamaica, and the Philippines, the audit found.\n\nDespite the allegations, Petersen is reportedly trying to hang onto his job. He has refused to resign despite being in federal custody since early October. Petersen\u2019s lawyer told the Associated Press he\u2019ll fight to keep his job, and that the law that allowed Petersen to be suspended without pay may be unconstitutional.\n\nCover: In this Oct. 9, 2019, file photo, a Utah home that was owned by an Arizona elected official charged with human smuggling in an adoption fraud scheme is shown in West Valley City, Utah.
