Trump also claimed that three other countries were currently studying the U.S. border wall but declined to name them.\n\nTrump said that 20 world-class mountain climbers tested different prototypes of the wall and the one he visited Wednesday was the most difficult to climb.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics Donald-Trump"], "top_image": ""}
