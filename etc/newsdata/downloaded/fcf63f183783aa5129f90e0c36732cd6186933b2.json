Roger, can you get back on board and unlock the boat, unlock the door so they can get off?\"\n\nBut Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said \"there are no locked doors in accommodation spaces\" where passengers slept on the Conception.\n\n\"The only privacy that you have ... are curtains,\" Rochester said Tuesday.\n\nFootage from a 2018 video aboard the Conception shows beds separated by curtains.\n\nShe said chaos and confusion during the inferno may have led to misunderstanding about the passengers possibly being locked.\n\n\"A lot of activity was happening, as you can surmise, coming over the communication system ... lot of confusion,\" Rochester said.\n\nGuests were trapped by fire\n\nWhile passengers were not locked in the sleeping deck, they were apparently trapped by the blaze, Sheriff Brown said.\n\n\"There was a stairwell to get down the main entryway, up and down, and there was an escape hatch. And it would appear as though both of those were blocked by fire.\"\n\nA layout of Conception's sleeping quarters shows only one stairwell leading up to the next deck.\n\nThe Conception passed its annual inspection\n\n\"This vessel is required to be inspected annually by the US Coast Guard, and it has been compliant,\" Rochester said.\n\nThe inspection requirements include smoke detectors on board, she said.\n\nFile footage from 2018 shows divers on board the Conception.\n\nIn addition to its safety features, the Conception was lauded for its size, speed and \"perfectly tailored design,\" Truth Aquatics said.\n\n\"The larger size allows for a revised galley and bunk layout, including more double bunks, bathrooms, and showers,\" the company said.\n\n\"This makes the Conception ideal for larger charter groups or limited load trips, with enough comfort to easily bring the Southern Islands within reach.\"\n\nA veteran of the boat narrowly escapes tragedy\n\nDale Sheckler, co-founder of California Diving News, has traveled on the Conception more than 100 times.\n\nHe was supposed to go on the ill-fated trip over Labor Day weekend. But a recent hip surgery may have saved his life.\n\n\"I just wasn't able to go out on the boat this particular weekend,\" Sheckler said.\n\n\"It was very painful to see this happen. I love the boat. I love the crew. I love the owners, they're just fantastic people.\"\n\nHe said the tragedy will have a lasting impact on the tight-knit diving community.\n\n\"It'll send ripples through the community for years to come, the amount of loss,\" Sheckler said. \"It's just devastating. I just can't imagine, as the names come out, I know I'm going to be shocked when I see the names.\"", "description": "The Conception was a hit with scuba divers and actor Rob Lowe, who said he had been on the vessel \"many times.\" But after 38 years at sea, the boat perished in a raging inferno on Labor Day, taking more than 20 lives with it.", "authors": ["Holly Yan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190902154639-02-conception-boat-file-super-tease.jpg"}
