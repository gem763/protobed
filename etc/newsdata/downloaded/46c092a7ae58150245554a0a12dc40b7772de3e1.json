Meanwhile, Rami Malek and Olivia Colman were awarded Best Actor and Actress respectively for their roles in Bohemian Rhapsody and The Favourite.\n\nHowever, BAFTA isn\u2019t the only British awards ceremony making changes. Last month, it was reported that organizers of the British Phonographic Industry\u2019s annual popular music award, known as the BRITs, are planning to scrap the male and female categories from 2021 onwards, in what The Times said was a way of \u201caccommodating musicians who define themselves as non-binary.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "British television shows must now meet a range of racial and gender targets in order to qualify for awards at the annual BAFTA ceremony.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Sherlock1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
