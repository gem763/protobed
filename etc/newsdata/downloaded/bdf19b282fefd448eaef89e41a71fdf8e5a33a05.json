Add Interest\n\nIn a letter to colleagues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the resolution \"establishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the President and his Counsel.\"\n\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe vote on the resolution comes as Republicans and the White House have argued against Democrats' handling of the impeachment process, although it's unlikely the resolution will go far enough to satisfy Republicans' demands.\n\n\"Speaker Pelosi is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew \u2013 that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding, refusing to give the President due process, and their secret, shady, closed door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate,\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. Grisham noted she would not be able to comment fully until she sees the full text of the resolution.\n\nThe resolution will be introduced by House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, who tweeted it will \"ensure transparency and provide a clear path forward.\"\n\nRepublicans have slammed what they say is a lack of transparency in the impeachment process, as Democrats have called nearly a dozen officials to give depositions behind closed doors. Republicans have called for transcripts of that testimony to be made public, have accused Democrats of cherry-picking information to be released or leaked, and have argued President Trump deserves to have counsel present to cross-examine witnesses.\n\nZach Gibson/Getty Images\n\nFor some Senate Republicans, the vote is too little, too late.\n\n\"They've made up their mind. Their judicial philosophy is guilty. They're going to give the president a fair and impartial firing squad,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.\n\n\u201cA vote now is a bit like un-ringing a bell as House Democrats have selectively leaked information in order to damage President Trump for weeks,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C. Last week, Graham introduced a resolution calling for the House to hold a vote to initiate a formal impeachment inquiry, to allow Trump to call witnesses on his behalf and to confront his accusers and to give subpoena power to House Republicans.\n\nGraham took some credit for the Democrats' decision to hold a vote, saying in a statement, \"There is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming response House Democrats heard from the American people and Senate Republicans in support of my resolution forced their hand. Today\u2019s announcement is an acknowledgement of the success of our efforts last week.\u201d\n\nSen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, is taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\"Let\u2019s see what it looks like. But if it\u2019s a vote that says that now we\u2019re just formally going to continue to do things exactly the way we\u2019ve been doing them, that wouldn\u2019t be enough to alleviate my concerns. Maybe it will be better than that,\" Blunt said.\n\nDemocrats, led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, have promised to make their inquiry public once they are finished gathering information in the classified setting.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Pelosi considered holding a vote to formally declare an impeachment inquiry, but ultimately held off.\n\n\"The timeline will depend on the truth-line,\" Pelosi said.\n\nABC News' Trish Turner and Mariam Khan contributed to this report.", "description": "The House of Representatives is expected to vote on Thursday on a resolution laying out the next steps in the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/nancy-pelosi-gty-jef-191015_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
