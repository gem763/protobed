For others, however, his named evoked only \"evil\", \"destruction\" and \"suffering\".\n\n\"Mugabe was an educated man but he used his education for evil,\" said Mr Baster Magwizi, a war veteran in the southwestern city of Bulawayo.\n\n\"He manipulated everyone around him and fooled the world, only Zimbabweans can testify to this as we lived in hell under his leadership,\" he said.\n\nBut Harare school teacher Tatenda Musoni was forgiving.\n\n\"To be honest I thought I would celebrate when he died but... I'm actually sad because he was an embodiment of what a true African should be.\n\n\"He had his flaws but he did a lot of positive things for us which I doubt we will ever see again in this country.\"\n\nMr Adam Molai, Mugabe's nephew, said the former president died of old age \"surrounded by family\".\n\n\"We are pained by his loss. But we also celebrate the life of a legend. He was a living legend. He was a pan-Africanist. He brought the country of Zimbabwe from colonialism to the freedom that we had,\" Mr Molai told reporters outside the funeral parlour in Singapore.\n\nHe said the President was likely to announce when the body would move \"sometime next week\", adding that he could give no further details on the \"state funeral\".\n\nIn Zvimba, Mr Mugabe's rural homestead, another nephew Leo Mugabe told reporters the family had \"not yet deliberated on where he is going to be buried\".\n\n'Revolutionary'\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa remembered Mr Mugabe as a \"liberation fighter\" and a \"champion of Africa's cause against colonialism\".\n\nKenyan leader Uhuru Kenyatta hailed Mr Mugabe as an \"elder statesman, a freedom fighter and a Pan-Africanist who played a major role in shaping the interests of the African continent\".\n\nChina lauded him as an \"outstanding national liberation movement leader\" while Russian President Vladimir Putin noted Mr Mugabe's \"great personal contribution\" to Zimbabwe's independence.\n\nBut Britain said there were \"mixed emotions\" after his death.\n\n\"Zimbabweans suffered for too long as a result of Mugabe's autocratic role,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe Mugabe years are widely remembered for his crushing of political dissent and policies that ruined the economy.\n\nThe former political prisoner turned guerrilla leader swept to power in 1980 elections after a growing insurgency and economic sanctions forced the Rhodesian government to the negotiating table.\n\nIn office, he initially won international plaudits for his declared policy of racial reconciliation and for extending improved education and health services to the black majority.\n\nHuman rights violations\n\nBut that faded rapidly as Mr Mugabe cracked down on his opponents. During the 1980s, he led an infamous campaign known as Gukurahundi during which an estimated 20,000 dissidents were killed.\n\nThe violent seizure of white-owned farms turned him into an international pariah - though his status as a liberation hero still resonates strongly across Africa.\n\nAimed largely at angry war veterans who threatened to destabilise his rule, the land reform policy wrecked the crucial agricultural sector, caused foreign investors to flee and plunged the country into economic misery.\n\nAll along, the Mugabe regime was widely accused of human rights violations and of rigging elections.\n\nThe topic of his succession was virtually taboo until he reached his 90s and became visibly frail.\n\nAs his health weakened, the military finally intervened to quash his second wife Grace's presidential ambitions in favour of their preferred candidate, Mr Mnangagwa, Mr Mugabe's vice-president at the time.\n\nMr Mnangagwa took over in November 2017 and was elected in July last year.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HARARE] Zimbabwe was on Saturday due to begin a period of national mourning following the death of Mr Robert Mugabe, the former guerrilla hero turned despot who ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years. .
