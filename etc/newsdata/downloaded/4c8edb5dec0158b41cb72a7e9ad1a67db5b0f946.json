But tensions could rise after the House on Tuesday passed three bills supporting pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong; China warned of retaliation if the bills become law, and said the U.S. should not interfere in what it considers its internal matters.\n\nMeanwhile, EU officials said a Brexit agreement could come by the end of the week, if the British government agrees to some concessions. The two sides continued negotiations at a leaders\u2019 summit, which comes just two weeks before the U.K.\u2019s scheduled departure date of Oct. 31.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei NIK, +1.28% rose 1.5% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.22% gained 0.3%. The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -0.28% was about flat, as was the Shenzhen Composite 399106, -0.03% . South Korea\u2019s Kospi 180721, +0.61% was up 0.8%. Malaysia\u2019s benchmark index FBMKLCI, +0.25% was down slightly, with stocks in Taiwan Y9999, +0.13% , Singapore STI, +0.59% and Indonesia JAKIDX, +0.24% gained. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +1.29% rose 0.9%.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Fast Retailing 9983, +3.88% surged in Tokyo trading, as did Yamaha Motor 7272, +3.12% and Toyota 7203, +1.10% . In Hong Kong, Geely Automobile 175, +2.10% gained, while PetroChina 857, -1.95% retreated. Samsung 005930, +1.20% rose in South Korea, and Beach Energy BPT, +0.43% and Commonwealth Bank CBA, +1.38% gained in Australia.\n\nStrong earnings from UnitedHealth Group UNH, +8.16% , JPMorgan Chase JPM, +3.01% and other companies helped power Wall Street\u2019s broad gains, erasing modest losses from a day earlier.\n\nInvestors are looking to the wave of quarterly report cards due out over the next few weeks to give them a clearer picture of what impact the trade war between the U.S. and China is having on corporate profits and the broader economy.\n\n\u201cGlobal market sentiment was seen picking up a notch overnight with Wall Street gaining on earnings despite the uncertainty that persists on U.S.-China trade,\u201d said Jingyi Pan, market strategist with IG in Singapore.\n\n\u201cBreaking news of China threatening to retaliate if U.S. passes the Hong Kong bill and the IMF\u2019s latest downgrading of the global growth forecast appear to be doing little to the trading action so far this morning, but remains items highlighting the uncertainty in outlook.\u201d\n\nThe encouraging earnings reports came with a spate of surprisingly good forecasts for the rest of the year, which helped ease concerns about a slowdown due to the costly trade conflict.\n\nThe S&P 500 index SPX, +1.00% climbed 29.53 points, or 1%, to 2,995.68. The benchmark index is now 1% below its all-time high set in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.89% rose 237.44 points, or 0.9%, to 27,024.80. The Nasdaq COMP, +1.24% gained 100.06 points, or 1.2%, to 8,148.71.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. agreed to suspend a planned hike in tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods that had been set to kick in Tuesday. Beijing, meanwhile, agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. farm products.\n\nThe U.S. did not, however, cancel plans for more tariffs in December and the sticking points of intellectual property and trade secrets still hang over the dispute.\n\nBenchmark crude oil CLX19, +0.23% rose 13 cents to $52.94 a barrel. It fell 78 cents to $52.81 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude oil BRNZ19, +0.27% , the international standard, rose 10 cents to $58.84 a barrel.\n\nThe dollar USDJPY, -0.17% rose to 108.69 Japanese yen from 108.27 yen on Monday.", "description": "Asian markets rose in early trading Wednesday following gains on Wall Street as U.S. earnings season kicked off and investors saw hope for the chances for a...", "authors": ["Marketwatch", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY355_tokyo1_ZG_20171114230431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
