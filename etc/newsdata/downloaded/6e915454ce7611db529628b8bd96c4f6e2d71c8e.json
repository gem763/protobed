Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\"\n\nThe lawyers called on leading Democrats and Republicans to speak out for protections for whistleblowers, and stress that retaliation against the unnamed official \"whether direct or implied\" will not be tolerated.\n\nThey also claimed that certain individuals have issued a \"$50,000 bounty\" for information regarding their client's identity.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we expect this situation to worsen, and to become even more dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers, as Congress seeks to investigate this matter.\"\n\nCBS News previously reported that the whistleblower was already under federal protection. But Mark S. Zaid, a lawyer from Compass Rose Legal, wrote on Twitter that CBS \"completely misinterpreted contents of our letter,\" and stressed that they have not yet reached an agreement with Congress regarding contact with their client.\n\nRead more: Trump is facing the biggest firestorm of his presidency because his own staffers blew the whistle on him\n\nTrump on Sunday demanded to meet with the whistleblower and doubled down on claims that those involved in the complaint may have committed treason.\n\n\"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \"Whistleblower,\" represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way,\" Trump wrote in a series of tweets on Sunday night.\n\nUS House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that he expects the whistleblower to testify \" very soon\" once security measures are in place to protect his identity.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced last week that the House will launch a formal impeachment inquiry, in light of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which is at the center of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nIntelligence Community Inspector General, Michael Atkinson, deemed the August 12 complaint \"credible\" and of \"urgent concern,\" and passed the complaint on to acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire.\n\nMaguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday and said that both the whistleblower and the inspector general \"acted in good faith throughout\" and \"have done everything by the book and followed the law.\"", "description": "Lawyers for the intelligence official claimed that individuals have issued a \"$50,000 bounty\" for information regarding their client's identity.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8bb0fa2e22af3ceb68f5f3-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
