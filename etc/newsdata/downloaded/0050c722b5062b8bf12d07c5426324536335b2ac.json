It's also more than three-and-a-half times the national median pay of $52,950.\n\nWhile the top 25 contenders skew tech-heavy, health care roles take the top four spots overall and comprise half of the top 10. These positions, including dentist, pharmacist and physician assistant, require master's or doctorate degrees in their specialty, oftentimes with additional training or specialized programs and proper licensing to practice.\n\nThe demand for jobs in health care is expected to skyrocket over the next decade, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics projections. However, some of the biggest growth opportunities will be concentrated in low-wage and high-demand work like home health aides and caretakers.\n\nThe first tech role that appears on the top-paying list is enterprise architect \u2014 a strategic role at an organization, that involves making sure information technology and business goals are aligned \u2014 which sits at No. 5 and earns about $122,000.\n\nOther lucrative tech roles on the list work with software development, data management and information security in various capacities. The roles don't often call for advanced degrees, and some list having four years of entry-level work experience as the equivalent of holding a bachelor's degree in a related engineering or computer science field. That said, workers at these high-earning levels are generally expected to have five or more years of technical experience \u2014 in addition to a four-year training period in school or otherwise \u2014 under their belt.\n\nGlassdoor compiled these rankings based on salary reviews left between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019.\n\nThe top 10 highest-paying jobs all pay over $100,000 \u2014 here's who comes out on top.", "description": "Glassdoor crunched the numbers on some of the most lucrative \u2014 and available \u2014 jobs in the country.", "authors": ["Jennifer Liu"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106134553-1568745449193gettyimages-938437262.jpg?v=1568745507", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
