Viewers of the coverage on Friday highlighted on social media how ITV had put their foot in it.\n\nThe pundits were providing analysis in the \u2018demonstration area\u2019, which has tatami mats as flooring. It is customary for anyone entering a tatami room to remove footwear.\n\nITV's rugby World Cup pundits were banned from wearing shoes during Friday's broadcast\n\nEagle-eyed rugby aficionados spotted was that pundits wore shoes on a tatami on opening day\n\nThose working on set realised their mistake midway through their first broadcast, and ITV have since corrected themselves by having their pundits, including Sportsmail\u2019s Sir Clive Woodward, work in socks. The rest of the studio is decorated in a Japanese theme, including a bonsai tree, and received a mixed reaction on social media.\n\nFormer England captain Will Carling tweeted: \u2018Slightly strange watching three ex-players in socks and jackets doing a walk through on ITV. Different.\n\n\u2018If England progress, maybe later in the tournament they could be in black tie or even smoking jackets?\u2019", "description": "Experts including Jonny Wilkinson, Sam Warburton and Brian O'Driscoll were spotted going against Japanese tradition by wearing shoes on a tatami floor before removing them under ITV's instruction.", "authors": ["Laura Lambert For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/09/18860946-0-image-a-7_1569315479447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
