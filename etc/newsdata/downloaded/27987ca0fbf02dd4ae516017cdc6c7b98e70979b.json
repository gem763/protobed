The Real Madrid defender, who received a standing ovation at Gij\u00f3n\u2019s El Molin\u00f3n stadium when substituted late in the game, will establish a new mark if he plays against Norway on Oct. 12.\n\n\u201cTo equal the best goalkeeper in the history of football was a very important goal for me,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cIt was complicated, but I had the good fortune to debut very young and to stay in favor of all the coaches I have had, and be blessed with not suffering injuries.\n\n\u201cI hope I can defend these colors for many more years.\u201d\n\nRamos has a record of 125 wins, 22 draws and 20 losses with Spain since his debut in 2005. He has helped Spain win a World Cup and two European Championships.\n\nItaly joined Spain in also winning its sixth match in as many qualifiers for next summer\u2019s tournament, keeping both on pace to win their respective groups.\n\nBut while Spain eased past the modest Faroe Islands, Italy struggled to win 2-1 at Finland.\n\nSpain and Italy are ranked 1st and 4th in UEFA\u2019s ranking of European teams, respectively. The Faroe Islands are ranked 53rd and Finland 43rd.\n\nSpain leads Group F with 18 points, well ahead of Sweden in second place with 11.\n\nItaly took a big step to winning Group J by taking its total to 18 points. Finland is second with 12.\n\nSTRIKE OPTIONS\n\nCoach Robert Moreno might have wanted an even bigger win over Spain\u2019s lowly opponent, but he must have liked seeing both of his strikers in fine form.\n\nRodrigo Moreno scored the first two goals before substitute Paco Alc\u00e1cer added a late brace.\n\nAlc\u00e1cer is building up some superb numbers with Spain, netting 11 goals in 16 appearances. Rodrigo is also producing goals while he and Alc\u00e1cer both fight for playing times with \u00c1lvaro Morata. Rodrigo and Morata have netted four goals each in six qualifiers.\n\n\u201cOur goal of qualifying is almost achieved,\u201d coach Moreno said. \u201cAll my players want to play and today was a game to show that they are motivated to play for the national side. They were all locked in and focused.\u201d\n\nRodrigo put Spain ahead in the 13th when he tapped into an open net after Thiago Alcantara pressured to recover the ball and knocked it to Mikel Oyarzabal, who lured in the goalkeeper before laying off to his attack partner.\n\nRodrigo doubled the advantage five minutes after the restart with a deflected shot when the Valencia striker received the ball and cut back across the area.\n\nAlcacer got Spain\u2019s third goal in the 90th - slicing in Thiago\u2019s low pass - before he headed in a final goal.\n\nAlso in Group F, Sweden\u2019s Emil Forsberg canceled out Stefan Johansen\u2019s goal for Norway in a 1-1 draw, a fourth consecutive stalemate between the Scandinavian rivals.\n\nRomania forward George Puscas headed in a goal just after halftime to beat Malta 1-0 and leave his team in third place in the group with 10 points.\n\nHAND BALL DISPUTE\n\nItaly needed a questionable hand ball decision to convert a penalty and eke out a win in Finland.\n\nSauli V\u00e4is\u00e4nen appeared to have his arm across his chest when he stopped a shot from Andrea Belotti, but the referee immediately pointed to the penalty spot and Jorginho quickly converted the winner in the 79th.\n\nTeemu Pukki had earned and scored a penalty for Finland seven minutes earlier after Ciro Immobile opened the scoring for Italy.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina coach Robert Prosinecki resigned after his team lost 4-2 at Armenia, which was led by two goals from Roma midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan.\n\nArmenia moved ahead of Bosnia and into third place in Group J with nine points.\n\nBottom sides Greece and Liechtenstein drew 1-1.\n\nMISSED CHANCE\n\nDenmark missed a chance to move into the lead of Group D ahead of Ireland after being held 0-0 at Georgia.\n\nSwitzerland brushed aside Gibraltar 4-0.\n\nSwitzerland is a point behind Denmark with a game in hand.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sergio Ramos equaled the record for the most appearances for Spain as his team continued its march toward qualifying for the 2020 European Championship by beating Faroe Islands 4-0 on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/spain_faroe_islands_euro_2020_soccer_45187_c0-83-2000-1249_s1770x1032.jpg?dc2de1c8909ff8deb251977349395aa0414518db", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
