(AP) - A former Michigan pastor who authorities say coerced underage girls to engage in sex acts online has pleaded guilty to producing child pornography.\n\nThe Times Herald of Port Huron reports 64-year-old Jack Woodburn entered the plea deal with prosecutors this week in U.S. District Court.

He was an associate pastor in Port Huron before retiring in 2018.\n\nCharges were brought after investigators interviewed at 13-year-old girl from Texas, who recalled talking to someone online claiming to be 15.
