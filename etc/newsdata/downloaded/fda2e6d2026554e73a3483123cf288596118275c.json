Heather Long explains why the deficit is ballooning under Trump. And Ben Strauss on the changing rules for college athletes.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nA utility thought forced power outages would check wildfires. It hasn\u2019t really worked.\n\nInvestigators are looking into whether fires ravaging Northern California may have been sparked by Pacific Gas & Electric equipment, deepening skepticism around the utility\u2019s controversial plan to prevent fires in the region by shutting off power to millions of residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUp to 2 million people were affected in the largest blackout over the weekend,\u201d says corporate accountability reporter Douglas MacMillan . His colleagues from The Post visited people affected by the shutdowns, who told them they had to spend their nights huddled around a gas fireplace to stay warm.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, nearly 200,000 wine-country residents have had to evacuate as a windstorm has complicated efforts to contain a major blaze in Northern California. Now many are wondering why PG&E hasn\u2019t invested in underground power lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump promised to eliminate the national debt. Instead, it\u2019s getting bigger.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, the United States ran a near-trillion-dollar deficit \u2014 an increase of more than 26 percent from the year before.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country\u2019s worsening fiscal picture runs in sharp contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promise to eliminate the national debt within eight years. The deficit is up nearly 50 percent in the Trump era. Since taking office, President Trump has endorsed big spending increases and historic tax cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented increase during good economic times,\u201d says reporter Heather Long . \u201cIf we\u2019re booming as much as the president says, we should be taking in a lot more tax dollars from corporations and individuals who are working again, and that\u2019s just not happening. And on top of that, both the president and Republicans and Democrats in Congress just keep edging up the spending.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the NCAA is changing its rules about paying college athletes\n\nThe NCAA has announced plans to allow college athletes to profit off of the use of their name, image and likeness, amid rising pressure from state and federal lawmakers to acknowledge their part in a $10 billion industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday, the organization for the first time publicly considered allowing college athletes to trade on their fame \u2013 but provided few specifics for how doing so could be reconciled with what they call the \u201ccollegiate model,\u201d which prohibits such benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important to note is that the NCAA really wants to maintain control of this system,\u201d says sports business reporter Ben Strauss . \u201cThis is not an effort to open the door to athletes being able to pursue their own market value.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Douglas MacMillan reports on a utility\u2019s controversial plan to prevent California wildfires.
