We are at Bournemouth\u2019s training ground and the striker is considering his career so far: from youth team sensation at Chelsea, through to Under-20 World Cup winner with England, to trying to dislodge Mohamed Salah, Sadio Man\u00e9 or Roberto Firmino in Liverpool\u2019s front three to joining the south-coast club for \u00a319 million last January.\n\nAnd then there was Jose Mourinho\u2019s remark when he declared that 'The Special One' would not be so special and would \u201cblame\u201d himself if Solanke did not just make it at Chelsea but with England as well.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI definitely wanted to break through but it got to a point where I just wanted to try and play,\u201d Solanke, who made only one substitute\u2019s appearance for Chelsea, admits. \u201cPeople might think I was impatient but I was just a young boy who wanted to play football.\u201d\n\nAt Chelsea it had felt like only a matter of time before Solanke made it but, following another change of manager, with Mourinho fired and Antonio Conte taking over, his contract running down and a stand-off over a new deal, he decided to leave. He took up an offer to go to Anfield in 2017 in a high-profile transfer which attracted increased scrutiny over his ability to fulfil his potential. Criticism came.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cGetting attention quite young can be a good and bad thing but it\u2019s just a part of football that everyone has to deal with. Everyone has opinions and you\u2019ve just got to stay mentally strong,\u201d Solanke, only just turned 22, says. \u201cThe good thing? It\u2019s good that you are getting talked about for a reason, having a good start early in your career. But the negative thing is that if things are not going so well \u2013 you know how social media is, for example. There will always be negative things said but it makes it even more important then to keep focused.\u201d\n\nThat is easier said than done. Solanke does not avoid social media but he has learnt how to process it having witnessed how \u201ceveryone has an opinion\u201d in the past few years. \u201cIf I see a negative comment I just try to ignore it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s true that it\u2019s hard not to take it to heart a little bit but I am in a good position and you need to think about the positives. Comments do not last forever.\u201d\n\nSolanke left Chelsea and Liverpool for the same reason - his determination to play matches Credit: Christopher Pledger for The Telegraph\n\nSolanke went from trying to shift Diego Costa and Didier Drogba to attempting to force his way into J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s forward line. Twenty-seven appearances in his first season sounded good but there was only one goal and it was stop-start. And in the second season, with Divock Origi and Daniel Sturridge back from loan spells to add to the competition, it stopped.\n\n\u201cWhen you are at a big club it is always going to be hit-or-miss,\u201d Solanke says. \u201cIf you take your chance when you get in - but it was tough to get into that front-three and you can see what they are achieving. Again I just wanted to start playing. I was seeing other people playing [at other clubs] who I knew and had come through with and I just felt I had to play.\n\n\"Everyone has different paths. Football is risk and reward. If you back yourself then hopefully you can go anywhere and do what you need to do. When Bournemouth called it was something that I really thought about and all the factors pointed to coming here and progressing in my career.\u201d\n\nBefore joining Liverpool Solanke had won the Under-20 World Cup with England in South Korea. He did not just win, he was named \u2018Golden Ball\u2019 \u2013 the player of the tournament \u2013 in a team that included Ademola Lookman, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Fikayo Tomori and was captained by Lewis Cook, now a Bournemouth team-mate.\n\n\u201cIt was just crazy, really,\u201d Solanke says. \u201cIt was something that not many people have done. Throughout that whole season I didn\u2019t play at all [at Chelsea] so I was just trying to keep fit for that tournament. I was in contact with the England manager at the time [Paul Simpson] and it was my main goal through the season, it was what I was preparing for and I wanted to go there and show everyone what I can do. I was aiming to be top-scorer but I managed to get the Golden Ball which is even better.\n\n\u201cIt was a squad that had grown up together, came through the youth teams and we are all good friends. That helped us as we all clicked and it showed throughout the tournament. It was a bright group and I think everyone will do well in their careers.\u201d\n\nSolanke tries to battle round Southampton's Cedric Credit: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images\n\nSolanke has noticed the recent shift in football with, finally, more young players being given their chance - and backed. Not least, at last, at Chelsea where he is pleased for Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham and Tomori who have all also now made it into the England senior squad. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened you could never have predicted it, really,\u201d Solanke says. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic for those boys. They managed to get their chance now and they have taken it. It\u2019s a good thing because the club needed something like that to happen. The talent that comes through the ranks at Chelsea is amazing and now the world can see that.\n\n\u201cPeople have started to notice that if someone gets a run in a team and is in form they can just build on that and it flows from there. They can get confidence, they are into their stride and it just carries on. Sometimes if you stop their development then mentally it\u2019s hard and you have to start finding another way, another path with your career.\u201d\n\nSolanke is doing that. He has started Bournemouth\u2019s last four matches \u2013 with the club up to eighth - and is expected to feature in Sunday\u2019s Premier League fixture at Arsenal. \u201cIn the last two years I\u2019ve not really had that rhythm and it\u2019s been quite difficult to find my feet when I\u2019ve been coming on every couple of games and not really had a proper run-out. So it\u2019s nice to have that now so I can build on it,\u201d Solanke says.\n\nSolanke scores for Liverpool against Brighton at Anfield in May 2018 Credit: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\n\u201cThis was a big move for me. Over the past few years they\u2019ve really been pushing and with the manager they have got and the young squad you can see what they are trying to do. Eddie Howe is a fantastic manager. I saw that before and obviously now I am working with him it\u2019s even more obvious that he\u2019s the right guy to push me on in my career. He is always looking to improve, help the team, work with you individually as well, going into detail ... He talks to me after training about specific things.\n\n\u201cAnd Bournemouth is the right team, also. Over the last few years I think everyone can see if you are playing for or against Bournemouth there is so much pace and talent. Sometimes it\u2019s quite frightening.\u201d\n\nSolanke is playing up-front with Callum Wilson, with Josh King moved to the left-wing. He knows he needs a goal after 18 appearances and having overcome the injury he came with. \u201cIt\u2019s very important,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce I get that one then hopefully they will start flowing in.\u201d\n\nThe focus is \u201cfully\u201d on Bournemouth but he already has one England senior cap \u2013 earned in a friendly against Brazil in November 2017 \u2013 and although he remains eligible to play for Nigeria he wants to break into Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad in time for Euro 2020.\n\n\u201cIt [Nigeria] is still an option but I want to focus on club football at the moment and make sure I am doing my stuff in the Premier League and hopefully the international stuff will take care of itself,\u201d Solanke says.\n\n\u201cSince Gareth took over there has been that window for a lot of us who knew him before he took the senior job. You can see that he likes to bring the young boys in and a lot of them have done well and stayed with them. But it starts with your club. I want to establish myself with Bournemouth, help the team, bring something extra and play well. But it [the Euros] is a target. It would be crazy if I didn\u2019t aim for that.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI remember that comment,\u201d Dominic Solanke says, smiling.
