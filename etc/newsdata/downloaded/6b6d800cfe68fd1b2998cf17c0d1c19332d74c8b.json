We've never done it to this level.\u201d\n\nThe latest sanctions layer on top of a slew of other penalties the Trump administration has imposed and reimposed as a result of Trump\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and other world powers. The existing sanctions have already targeted Iran\u2019s oil exports, its metal and mining industries and its ability to receive financing from international banks. Tehran has repeatedly likened the sanctions to \u201ceconomic warfare.\u201d\n\nThe new sanctions will affect \u201cthe last remaining source of funds for both the central bank of Iran, as well as the national development fund \u2014 which is their sovereign wealth fund,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Friday. \u201cThis is very big \u2014 we've now cut off all source of funds to Iran.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

We are at a level of sanctions that is far greater than ever before, with respect to Iran,\" he reiterated, arguing that Iran has \"a lot of self-made problems.\"\n\nHe added: \"Iran could be a great country, a rich country. But they are choosing to go a different way.\"\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani has said repeatedly that relief from U.S. sanctions would be a precondition for any meeting between himself and Trump.\n\nThe president first forecasted a new round of penalties in a tweet this week, though he did not provide any specifics at the time.\n\nThe drone strikes, which took place overnight last Saturday, disrupted half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil supply and the daily equivalent of 5 percent of the world\u2019s oil supply. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen have maintained that they are responsible for the strikes, though some U.S. officials, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have blamed Iran for the attacks from the outset.\n\nThroughout the week, Trump has been more hesitant to directly blame Iran, though he\u2019s alluded to it multiple times. Saudi Arabia also took longer to publicly blame Tehran, citing the need to finish investigating the strikes, but it too finally accused Iran of carrying out the attacks later in the week.\n\nIran has denied any culpability for the attack and warned the U.S. that a military response will spark an \u201call-out war\u201d and immediate retaliation from Tehran.\n\nTrump has increasingly leaned against responding militarily despite asserting over the weekend and throughout the week that the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d and could attack at any time.\n\nUnder fire from Iran hawks in Congress over his manner of responding to the strikes, he defended his decision to go the sanctions route, contending that a retaliatory attack would, in fact, be \u201cthe easiest thing I could do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy. For all of those that say they should do it, it shows weakness, it shows \u2014 actually, in my opinion it shows strength because it\u2019s the easiest thing I could do \u2014 OK, go ahead, knock out 15 different major things in Iran,\u201d the president said with a shrug. \u201cI could do that. All set to go. It's all set to go. But I'm not looking to do that if I can.\u201d\n\nTrump maintained that his new sanctions did not preclude him from military action, nor did he say that such a move was off the table.\n\nBut \u201cI think the strong person's approach, and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint,\u201d he argued. \u201cMuch easier to do it the other way. It\u2019s much easier. And Iran knows if they misbehave they are on borrowed time.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported Friday that Pentagon officials are set to offer Trump an array of possible responses to the attack. At the White House hours later, the president punted when asked by a reporter whether he was weighing any other non-military options in the event that Iran continues to lash out and stir up conflict in the region, and would not elaborate on possible alternatives.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about that,\" Trump said. \"But I will say I think the sanctions work, and the military would work, but that is a very severe form of winning. But we win. Nobody can beat us militarily. No one can even come close.\"", "description": "Trump is unlikely to back down from his maximum pressure campaign against Tehran.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/07/db/efe447144904bb9e8872e59213dd/190920-trump-rahman.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
