Temperatures for rescue workers on the hull of the ship rose to 120 fahrenheit (49 celsius) and Reed believed it was even hotter inside the ship.\n\nAsked about the condition of the three rescued crew members, Reed said two of them were able to walk off the hull of the ship and get on a tugboat. All three were taken to hospital.\n\n\u201cTheir condition is relatively good for having spent 34 or 35 hours in the conditions they were in,\u201d Reed said.\n\nHe declined to comment on what might have caused the vessel to tip over as it transported cars.\n\nHelicopters rescued 20 crew members from the 656-foot (200-meter) Golden Ray on Sunday after it became disabled, began listing and eventually fell helplessly on its side in St. Simons Sound, near Brunswick, Georgia, the Coast Guard said in a statement.\n\nThe ship had previously called at the Port of Brunswick, Georgia, and was headed to Baltimore, according to the Vessel Finder website. The carrier was built in 2017 and was sailing under the flag of the Marshall Islands, it said.", "description": "Rescue workers on Monday freed three of four missing crew members from a South Korean cargo vessel that flipped on its side off the coast of Georgia, the U.S. Coast Guard said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
