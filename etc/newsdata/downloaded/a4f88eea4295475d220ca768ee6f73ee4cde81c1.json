It also ousted Kaie Metsla, head of the bank\u2019s private customer division.\n\nThe moves were a result of shortcomings that Swedbank identified as part of its ongoing probe into allegations that dirty money, much of it from Russia, flowed through its Estonian division, the bank said.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up \u201cRemoving three appreciated leaders from their positions is a tough decision to make,\u201d Bj\u00f6rn Elfstrand, council chair of Swedbank Estonia, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, it is a consequence of the bank\u2019s ongoing internal investigation.\u201d Swedbank said no criminal activities have been identified as part of the probe. The bank declined to comment Tuesday beyond its previous statement. Swedbank named Olavi Lepp as permanent CEO of the Estonian division. Mr. Lepp has served as acting CEO since June and, before that, was chief risk officer. Anna K\u00f5uts, acting CFO of the Estonian unit and previous head of treasury, was named permanent CFO. Additionally, Tarmo Ulla will succeed Ms. Metsla as head of private banking. Ms. Ulla was head of lending support for Swedbank in the Baltics, according to a LinkedIn profile in her name. Swedbank for months has been working to move past a scandal ignited by a February report by Swedish TV network SVT that 50 suspicious customers moved at least $4 billion through the bank between 2007 and 2015. European and U.S. authorities have opened investigations into the bank\u2019s management of money-laundering risks. Swedbank, meanwhile, has reshuffled its executive ranks and hired law firm Clifford Chance to conduct an investigation into shortcomings in the bank\u2019s anti-money-laundering controls.
