You're all giggling as if you didn't want to answer, or you thought it was a stupid question - not quite sure which one?'\n\nHooker Latu then said: 'Stupid question. To ask it, I don't know, it's different for you guys and different for us. For us, it comes across as a stupid question so that's why we're all laughing.\n\n'Obviously, you're asking us a question that we think is a complete joke so, if you're going to ask us questions like that, we'll take it as a joke and throw it back at you.'\n\nSalakaia-Loto then backed up his team-mate when asked a question on why he believed Australia could defy their underdog status and beat England in Oita.\n\n'Because we can, why not?' he said. 'We all believe it, we're not just going to sit here and go, \"Oh, don't think we believe it,\" of course we can. We all believe that we can do whatever we want to do, if we put our mind to it.'\n\nSalakaia-Loto joked that coach Cheika was a 'bully' before admitting he is a 'nice guy'\n\nAdam Coleman was the third Australia player present to speak ahead of their quarter-final tie\n\nHe then asked the reporter if he believed Australia could do it, and when the response from the journalist came back as a 'not sure', the flanker was unimpressed.\n\n'Really? That's your problem then. We believe we can beat them,' he said.\n\nThe same player also bristled at questions on Cheika, and when asked whether he was a 'caring sort of guy', said: 'Nah, he's mean, he's a bully, bullies everyone. (No) He's good, man, good fella.'\n\nChristian Lealiifano of Australia trains during a gym session in Odawara on Monday", "description": "A trio of Australian rugby players clashed with journalists at a frosty press conference on Monday after being quizzed on whether they could beat England in their Rugby World Cup quarter-final.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/12/19690062-0-image-a-13_1571053143814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
