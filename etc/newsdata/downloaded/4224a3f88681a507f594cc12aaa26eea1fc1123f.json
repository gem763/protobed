Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), IBD-TIPP\u2019s October poll shows.\n\nThe IBD/TIPP Poll \u2013 taken September 26 to October 3 among 900 adults (including a \u201csubset\u201d of 341 Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents) \u2013 showed the president edging out Warren in support from independent voters in a hypothetical general election matchup. While the poll shows Warren narrowly leading Trump overall \u2013 48 percent to 46 percent \u2013 Trump leads Warren among independent voters by six percentage points, 49 percent to 43 percent.\n\nSimilarly, Trump leads Sanders among independent voters by four points, 48 percent to 44 percent. A head-to-head matchup shows Sanders surpassing Trump by three points overall \u2013 49 percent to 46 percent.\n\nBiden performs the best against Trump in a general election matchup \u2013 51 percent to 44 percent \u2013 the survey found. However, his lead narrowed by five points from September\u2019s poll, when he led Trump 54 percent to 42 percent.\n\nIn September, Biden saw an overwhelming amount of support from independent voters, 55 percent to Trump\u2019s 37 percent. October\u2019s results, however, signal a dramatic shift, with Biden narrowly leading Trump among independent voters, 46 percent to 45 percent. The poll\u2019s margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.\n\nThe survey also examined the Democrat primary field, which currently shows Warren leading the pack with one point over Biden, 27 percent to 26 percent. Sanders fell to a distant third with just ten percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with seven percent support.\n\nThe poll also showed another significant drop for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who tied with Andrew Yang (D) for fifth place with just three percent support:", "description": "President Trump is gaining support from independent voters and holding an edge with the demographic over potential Democrat challengers.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/President-Donald-Trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
