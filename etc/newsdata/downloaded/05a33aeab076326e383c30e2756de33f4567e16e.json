On a recent afternoon, Katherina Sourine was among only a few in attendance.\n\nBut Ms Sourine, a University of Michigan senior, was there because she had to be. As one of four city and government reporters for Ann Arbor\u2019s sole daily newspaper, she had biked through a steady rain between classes to take notes on the city\u2019s plans for developing a new park.\n\n\u201cIf we weren\u2019t covering it, no one would know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Ms Sourine, 21, who also plays rugby and is taking a full schedule of classes this semester. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to take time out of my day, especially when breaking news hits.

After The Ann Arbor News shuttered its daily print edition in 2009 \u2014 and eventually its website, too \u2014 a staff of about 300 student journalists has worked hard to provide incisive coverage about the city\u2019s police, power brokers and policymakers, all while keeping up with school.\n\nStudent journalists across the country have stepped in to help fill a void after more than 2,000 newspapers have closed or merged, leaving more than 1,300 communities without any local news coverage. And several young reporters have broken consequential stories that have prodded powerful institutions into changing policies.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

President Trump's most shocking attacks on the media 1/16 \"You are fake news!\" Then President-elect Trump directed this insult to CNN's Jim Acosta while refusing him a question at a press conference on January 11 2017. The President-elect's anger was due to the publishing by Buzzfeed of unverified memos that implicated Michael Cohen in Russian collusion. CNN had reported on a briefing of Obama and Trump on the memos by US intelligence chiefs, but knowing the content to be unverified had not revealed it AFP/Getty 2/16 \"They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth\" President Trump said this of journalists during a visit to the CIA on the the day following his inauguration. His claim of having the largest crowd of any inauguration ceremony in history had been debunked and he clearly wasn't happy Reuters 3/16 \"Failing New York Times\" President Trump commonly addresses the New York Times in this way, contrary to its increasing profit margins and expanding global readership. He is pictured here in the midtown Manhattan office of the paper Getty 4/16 \"Enemy of the American People\" President Trump has since repeated the claim that such news outlets are the enemy of the people, often after they break negative stories about him 5/16 \"They have no sources\" Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference on February 24 2017, President Trump suggested that a Washington Post article with 9 sources was \"made up\". The article in question exposed how then National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence over a phone call to a Russian ambassador. That the article was \"made up\", while highly doubtful at the time, seems even less likely since Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the same phone call Reuters 6/16 Access denied for major publications Protesters gathered outside of the New York Times office after Trump's White House barred a number of publications from attending a press briefing on February 24 2017. Just hours after the President had again denounced the media, then Press Secretary Sean Spicer denied access to news outlets such as CNN and the New York Times, while permitting Breitbart News, CBS, Fox and others AFP/Getty 7/16 \"#FNN\" On July 2 2017, President Trump tweeted an edited clip from his Wrestlemania XXIII appearance in which the CNN logo had been imposed onto the face of his wrestling opponent Vince McMahon. CNN is a common target for President Trump and here he suggests that he is getting the better of the network through his repeated attacks 8/16 \"The most powerful TV show in America\" On July 27 2017, President Trump quoted a New York Times article about Fox & Friends. The President is known to watch Fox & Friends every morning, often tweeting about matters discussed on the show, leading to speculation over its influence on his outlook and policies Getty 9/16 \"It's frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write\" In a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on October 11 2017, President Trump suggested that the press ought not to be allowed their constitutionally secured freedom. He added \"people should look into it\", suggesting that he also doesn't respect the protection of sources. At the time, he was angry at an NBC report claiming that the President had expressed a desire to return the size of the US' nuclear arsenal to its 1960s height, a claim that he and others in his administration dismissed as fake news AFP/Getty 10/16 \"negative (Fake)\" In a tweet on 9 May 2018, President Trump conflated negative reporting about him with fake news 11/16 \"I didn't criticise the Prime Minister\" In a press conference with the Prime Minister on his visit to Britain, President Trump disputed claims published in the Sun that he had criticised Mrs May's Brexit strategy Reuters 12/16 \"Horrible, horrendous people\" At a Republican rally in Pennsylvania on August 3 2018, President Trump deemed all journalists in attendance \"horrible, horrendous people\". He later denounced the \"fake, fake, disgusting news\" for falsely reporting that he was late to his meeting with the Queen when visiting Britain AFP/Getty 13/16 Trump's rhetoric \"very close to inciting violence\" In an interview with the Guardian on 13 August 2018, the outgoing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein suggested that President Trump's attacks on the press are \"very close to inciting violence\". Zeid singles out the President's repeated claim that the fake news (negative coverage) media is the \"enemy of the people\" as dangerous Reuters 14/16 \"anonymous source\" = fiction President Trump claimed that any report citing anonymous sources is fiction. The protection of sources is a vital matter of press freedom, without it a potential source's fear of repercussions could lead them to withhold important information 15/16 \"You are a rude, terrible person\" At a press conference in the wake of the midterms, President Trump clashed with CNN's Jim Acosta when he asked about the President's use of language during the campaign Reuters 16/16 \"I would never kill Journalists\" For any journalists frightened by President Trump's attacks on the press, perhaps you can take solace in his words from a campaign rally in Grand Rapids on December 21 2015. Responding to remarks over Vladimir Putin's handling of journalists, Trump stated: \"I hate some of these people, but I'd never kill them... I'll be honest - I would never kill them.

Uhhh lets see.. no, I never would\" Getty\n\nA high school newspaper in Pittsburg, Kansas, forced the resignation of the principal after discovering discrepancies in her resume. After writing an article about a school employee\u2019s unprofessional conduct charges, high school editors in Burlington, Vermont, won a censorship battle against their principal.\n\nAnd when the State Department\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine resigned abruptly last month, a 20-year-old junior at Arizona State University broke the news in the school\u2019s student newspaper, a scoop that gained international attention. The university\u2019s Cronkite News Service has offices in Phoenix and Los Angeles, as well as in Washington, where this semester 10 student journalists are contributing to more than 30 professional news outlets in Arizona.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the largest Arizona-based news gathering operation in Washington because we\u2019re the only Arizona-based news gathering operation in Washington,\u201d said Steve Crane, director of Washington operations at Arizona State\u2019s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.\n\nDespite little training and no university journalism program, the staff of The Michigan Daily has embraced its vital role. Last year, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, it published a lengthy investigation that detailed sexual misconduct allegations against a professor, leading to his early retirement. In 2014, the paper published a major scoop about a sexual assault that the university concealed to protect a football player.\n\nAnd on the first day of classes this semester, the Daily reported that the university had quietly stopped offering free testing for sexually transmitted diseases, prompting protests that forced the school\u2019s administration to reinstate the program.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Ann Arbor Chronicle, an online news publication that focused on city government, folded in 2014 after six years.\n\nToday, the Daily\u2019s closest competitor is MLive.com, a news website owned by Advance Publications that covers the state of Michigan. The company regularly publishes articles about Ann Arbor, including in a twice-weekly print digest branded as The Ann Arbor News, and it employs a staff of local journalists who cover the city\u2019s government, real estate, police and other beats. But some residents said the student paper has often more effectively covered the community.\n\nUnlike many college newspapers, the Daily has financial support \u2014 in the form of a $4.5 million endowment \u2014 to sustain its breadth of reporting, said Neil Chase, chairman of the university\u2019s student publications board.\n\nMetropolitan daily newspapers, most of which have suffered through annual cuts to their news pages and editorial staffs, would quite likely envy the Daily\u2019s rare financial position, said Mr Chase, who was its editor-in-chief in the 1980s and is the former executive editor of The Mercury News in San Jose, California, and The East Bay Times in Northern California.\n\n\u201cIn a city of 100,000 people, you have to decide if you\u2019re going to cover a City Council meeting, a car crash, or some other local news because you only have a few people to go around,\u201d he said. But the Daily \u201chas so many people, they don\u2019t have to make those tough decisions.\u201d\n\nDuring the academic year its print edition, with a circulation of about 7,500, is dropped off five days a week at more than 100 locations on and off campus, said Tommy Dye, 20, the paper\u2019s business manager. Print costs are mostly covered by advertising revenue, helped in large part by special sections, such as an annual issue that includes baby photos of graduating seniors and brings in up to $45,000, he said.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t always take us seriously, older journalists who\u2019ve been doing this for years just kind of look at you like you\u2019re not there Shelby Lindsay, student reporter\n\nStill, as reader habits have shifted, the newsroom has embraced a more digital future. Its website fetches nearly 500,000 page views every month, and the staff has created four podcasts, including a weekly news podcast that includes coverage of city issues.\n\nLike the local news industry at large, the Daily, which had a daily circulation of 10,000 copies only a few years ago, has struggled to retain print readers.\n\nAcross the United States, digital readership of campus newspapers has continued to grow while print advertising revenues have plummeted. The University of Maryland at College Park\u2019s student newspaper, The Diamondback, announced this month that it would begin publishing only online in March, joining a long list of student newspapers that have cut back or ceased print production in recent years.\n\nOther challenges facing student journalists include the temporary nature of their positions. Unlike their professional counterparts, student reporters and editors learn on the job, and they invariably move on after a few semesters, well before developing sources or truly understanding the complexities of their beat, whether City Hall or the financial markets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pretty much become the institutional memory,\u201d said Mr Crane, who has worked for Arizona State in Washington for nine years, overseeing an army of students who have come and gone.\n\nShelby Lindsay, 23, who worked as a reporter and camerawoman for Cronkite News in Washington during her final semester at Arizona State, said it was too easy for people in authoritative positions \u2014 such as police or elected officials \u2014 to ignore student requests for interviews.\n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t always take us seriously,\u201d she said, and \u201colder journalists who\u2019ve been doing this for years just kind of look at you like you\u2019re not there.\u201d\n\nOn a recent evening, undergraduates wearing shorts and Michigan sweatshirts crowded around long tables in the Daily\u2019s newsroom, housed on the top floor of the university\u2019s art deco-inspired student publications building. A cluster of sports reporters was watching the Washington Nationals play the Milwaukee Brewers. As deadlines loomed, bagels and cream cheese sat largely forgotten.\n\nReporters are expected to write their articles in the newsroom, usually seated across from their editors. \u201cIf it\u2019s getting late we can breathe down their necks a little bit,\u201d said Leah Graham, 20, the paper\u2019s no-nonsense city and government editor, who was waiting for more reporters to arrive from a city planning commission meeting and other events around town.\n\nElizabeth Nelson, a member of Ann Arbor\u2019s City Council who started a blog to keep residents informed about the council\u2019s votes and agendas, said the student newspaper covers a lot of things that MLive.com does not, adding that local journalism is even more crucial at a time when many residents are getting information \u2014 and disinformation \u2014 through social media.\n\nWhile Nelson said she appreciates that the Daily\u2019s journalists contact her for comment and context, she said their lack of institutional memory can make their reporting \u2014 and the students who read it \u2014 vulnerable to political spin.\n\n\u201cCouncil members are able to frame issues in a way that\u2019s compelling for university students who don\u2019t necessarily understand the history,\u201d she said.\n\nMany residents simply wish there was more local journalism.\n\nEdward Vielmetti, 54, who works for a technology company and has lived in Ann Arbor for 37 years, said he misses the days when he could turn to one source for the latest city news, including restaurant openings, real estate prices or school board meetings. An avid follower of local politics, he said he often attends City Council meetings, where he has met some of the Daily\u2019s staff.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to not have them be the only reporters in the audience, and yet they are there,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout The Michigan Daily, this town would be a lot poorer for knowledge about what\u2019s actually happening.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Municipal committee meetings \u2014 the tedious minutiae of Ann Arbor\u2019s local governance \u2014 do not tend to draw a crowd.
