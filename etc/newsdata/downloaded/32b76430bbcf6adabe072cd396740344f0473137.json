(Yuri Kageyama/AP)\n\nSouth Korea formally asked the International Olympic Committee to ban any use of Japan\u2019s Rising Sun flag at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics on Wednesday, comparing it to the Nazi swastika, in the latest salvo in a bitter row between the U.S. allies.\n\nSeoul\u2019s Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism said it has written to IOC President Thomas Bach expressing its disappointment and concern that the organizers of the Tokyo 2020 Games have not taken steps to ban any possible displays of the flag.\n\nThe flag, portraying a red sun with 16 rays extending outward, has been used by Japan for centuries and is still used by the country\u2019s military Self-Defense Forces.\n\nBut it was also used by Japan\u2019s Imperial Army and Navy during World War II and is resented by many South Koreans because of Japan\u2019s brutal colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.\n\nIt is distinct from Japan\u2019s national flag, a simple crimson disk on a white background, which its Olympic team will carry.\n\n\n\nRelations between South Korea and Japan have plummeted this year to their lowest level in decades. The dispute began over compensation for forced labor during colonial rule and spiraled into a series of tit-for-tat moves undermining trade and security cooperation.\n\nMany South Koreans are boycotting Japanese goods, from beer to clothes, while tourism between the two countries has slumped.\n\n\n\nA man dressed as an Imperial Army soldier stands behind the Rising Sun flag in Tokyo.

It compared the flag to Nazi Germany\u2019s swastika.\n\nThe ministry said displays of the Rising Sun flag would not correspond to \u201cOlympism and the Olympic Value for promoting a peaceful society and the harmonious development of humankind,\u201d and it asked the IOC to make the Tokyo Organizing Committee ban its use in Olympic venues.\n\nSouth Korean outrage over the use of the Rising Sun flag is a relatively recent phenomenon, largely dating back to 2011, has been inflamed by anti-Japan nationalism and a feeling that Japan has not properly apologized for its behavior during colonial rule.\n\nLast week, Japan pulled out of an international fleet review hosted by South Korea after refusing to accede to a demand not to fly the Rising Sun flag from its ships.\n\n\n\nSouth Korean protesters tear up a huge Rising Sun flag during an anti-Japanese rally marking the anniversary of Korea\u2019s liberation from Japan\u2019s 1910-45 colonial rule, in central Seoul on Aug. 15.
