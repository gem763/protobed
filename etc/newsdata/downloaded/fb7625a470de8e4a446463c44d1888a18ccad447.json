Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Eliot Engel \u2014 along with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said their investigation has already garnered \u201cextensive evidence and testimony.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a President who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cFollowing in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the President\u2019s misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe Judiciary Committee will receive a report from the three committees leading the Ukraine investigation on their findings and all the records from their investigations. It would also be able to craft its own rules on for its own hearings and procedures over impeachment, including how President Trump and his legal team can cross examine or call witnesses.\n\nAs explained in a fact sheet from the Democrats, the president and his team can respond to evidence, can request additional testimony or witnesses, and attend Judiciary hearings.\n\nThough there is a catch \u2014 no more obstruction.\n\n\u201cIf the President unlawfully refuses to cooperate with Congressional requests, the Chair shall have the discretion to impose appropriate remedies, including by denying specific requests by the President or his counsel,\u201d the fact sheet reads.\n\nRepublicans have spent the last few weeks railing against the proceedings, slamming it as a sham, illegitimate, and unfair process that limited their participation and lacked due process.\n\nThe resolution would also grant the ranking members of the Intelligence and the Judiciary Committees the ability to formally request their own witnesses and subpoenas, if they can get the chairs or committees to approve them.\n\n\u201cAny such request shall be accompanied by a detailed written justification of the relevance of the testimony of each requested witness to the investigation described in the first section of this resolution,\u201d the resolution notes.\n\nWhile these procedures mostly already exist in House rules, this resolution doesn\u2019t give Republicans any real power in these proceedings. They\u2019ve always been able to request witnesses from Democrats.\n\nIn a note to Republicans, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise continued to slam the impeachment inquiry as \u201ctainted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resolution fails to provide the minority and the administration with the same due process rights which have been afforded in past presidential impeachments and is simply meant to authorize the production of a tainted document authored by Chairman Schiff,\u201d a memo from Mr. Scalise\u2019s office read.\n\nDemocrats were expected to put the resolution to a vote this week, but Majority Leader Steny Hoyer softened that deadline earlier Tuesday morning as most members had yet to see what they\u2019d be voting on.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
