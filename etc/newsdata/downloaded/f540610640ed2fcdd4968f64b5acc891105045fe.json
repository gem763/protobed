Other sectors were largely in a holding pattern.\n\nThe decision of U.K. lawmakers to vote down a government motion trying to ram Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal bill through parliament means that there will be no time to formalize exit terms with the EU before the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nThe EU is currently considering a request for an extension to the deadline and has the choice of either accepting (for which it needs unanimity among its other 27 members) or of rejecting. While the latter would lead to a disorderly Brexit on Oct. 31, it seems unlikely given the EU\u2019s recent public statements.\n\nWhat is unclear is whether the EU would grant just enough time for the bill to be scrutinized, or for the U.K. to hold a general election if that was the preferred option of the U.K. An election could either return a majority government under Johnson, or another \u201chung\u201d parliament with no overall control.\n\nEither way, the pound\u2019s decline overnight on the back of the developments made the the best performing index of the morning, gaining 0.4% by 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT). The benchmark was down 0.2% at 394.00, unable to break through a resistance level where it has stalled on no fewer than five occasions since May 2018.\n\nGermany\u2019s was flat, while the French was down 0.4% after a bigger-than-expected drop in business confidence, as reported by Insee. Support came from carmaker PSA, which rose 2.1% after its third-quarter results avoided a repeat of Renault\u2019s horror show last week.\n\nIn London, meanwhile, Fresnillo (LON: ) fell to the bottom of the after reporting a drop in third-quarter output and warning of another dip in the fourth quarter due to lower ore grades. Antofagasta (LON: ) gained after reassuring that it only faced a modest hit to output at its mines in Chile from the civil unrest there in recent days.", "description": "StockBeat: Europe Can't Get Over the Brexit Hump", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE930QT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
