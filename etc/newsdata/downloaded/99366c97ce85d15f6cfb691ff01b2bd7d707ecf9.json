(Darryl Dyck/Bloomberg)\n\nWhen Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was approving the expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, Leah George-Wilson prepared for a fight.\n\nGeorge-Wilson, chief of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation in Vancouver, said the $5.5 billion expansion will endanger the ecosystems of the inlet at the foot of her reserve. She\u2019s challenging Trudeau\u2019s decision in court.\n\nSome 250 miles northeast, Chief Michael LeBourdais of the Whispering Pines/Clinton Indian Band near Kamloops, British Columbia, was also following the government\u2019s decision. Not because he opposes the pipeline. He wants to buy it.\n\nLeBourdais leads the Western Indigenous Pipeline Group, one of several indigenous-led coalitions vying for a stake in the project. The groups argue that revenue from the pipeline, which carries crude oil from the Alberta tar sands to the British Columbia coast, could alleviate poverty in their communities, and ownership would give them a voice in decisions about environmental protections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been shut out of the economy since Canada was created,\u201d LeBourdais said.\n\nHe wants to buy a stake of at least 51 percent in the project and split the spoils with the indigenous groups directly along the pipeline route. By some estimates, the expanded pipeline, used at full capacity, could generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue for its owners.\n\n\n\nChief Michael LeBourdais of the Whispering Pines/Clinton Indian Band leads the Western Indigenous Pipeline Group, one of several indigenous-led coalitions vying for a stake in the pipeline.

But a controlling stake in a project the size of Trans Mountain, Coates said, would be unprecedented.\n\n\u201cThis is actually the first time in Canadian history that they have the chance to participate in a major way and in an ongoing way in the kind of prosperity that Canadians take for granted,\u201d he said.\n\n[On Monday, Canada declared a \u2018climate emergency.\u2019 On Tuesday, it approved a pipeline expansion.]\n\nCanada in recent years has struggled to complete major energy projects such as pipelines, in part because they tend to draw opposition from indigenous groups.\n\nThe Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is no different: It has touched off an interprovincial feud, exacerbated the ongoing antagonism between the energy sector and environmentalists, and divided indigenous groups.\n\nFor Trudeau, it has posed a major headache ahead of a tough federal election in October. The Liberal leader has promised to fight climate change, but fossil fuel extraction remains a pillar of the Canadian economy.\n\nCanada is the world\u2019s sixth largest energy producer and its fifth largest net exporter, according to its natural resources agency. The energy industry generated $174 billion in 2018, or 11.1 percent of nominal gross domestic product; it employed 269,000 people directly and supported more than 550,500 indirectly. (The numbers include all energy sources, not just fossil fuels.)\n\nTrudeau initially approved the pipeline expansion in 2016, but a federal appeals court soon annulled the decision, saying the government had failed to properly consult with indigenous people or consider the impact of increased tanker traffic on Pacific waters.\n\nWith the expansion in legal and political limbo, the Trudeau government bought the pipeline from Texas-based Kinder Morgan in 2018 for $3.4 billion. It intends to auction it back to the private sector once it has been \u201cde-risked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will divest the Trans Mountain entities to a new owner or owners in a manner and at a time that protects the public interest, including the government\u2019s investment,\u201d said Pierre-Olivier Herbert, a finance ministry spokesman.\n\nThe prime minister approved the project again in June, saying it was crucial for alleviating a pipeline shortage that has slowed the flow of Alberta crude to market. That kicked off a fresh round of protests and legal challenges.\n\nEven among indigenous groups, the project has opened divisions \u2014 between pro- and anti-pipeline groups, but also between the indigenous-led coalitions clamoring for a stake in the project.\n\nA federal appeals court said Thursday it would hear six of those challenges, further delaying the project.\n\n\u201cWe have left Indians and right Indians,\u201d LeBourdais said. \u201cIt\u2019s like politics anywhere.\u201d\n\nLeBourdais wanted to buy a stake in the project long before Trudeau approved it in 2016.\n\n\u201c[Government officials] were saying, \u2018Woah, woah, slow down.\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, no, this is a race.\u2019\n\n\u201cLook what happened. Now we have all these other pretenders coming up.\u201d\n\n[Trudeau announces Canadian ban on \u2018harmful\u2019 single-use plastics]\n\nDelbert Wapass, executive chairman and founder of the rival Project Reconciliation group, said the opportunity is \u201calmost too good to be true\u201d \u2014 so much so that his group submitted a preliminary proposal to the federal government, which is not yet accepting bids, earlier this summer.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re no longer stuck managing poverty, now you\u2019ve moved the needle where you\u2019re starting to manage wealth,\u201d said Wapass, the former chief of Saskatchewan\u2019s Thunderchild First Nation.\n\nHis group wants to buy a 51 percent stake in the existing pipeline and the expansion project, a $5.2 billion acquisition that would be financed by one of Canada\u2019s big banks, with the debt backed by oil-shipping contracts.\n\nAbout 20 percent of the proceeds from the pipeline would be disbursed to the some 340 indigenous groups in Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia who can join the project, he said; those groups closer to the pipeline route would get larger cuts.\n\nThe rest would go into an indigenous sovereign wealth fund.\n\nLeBourdais opposes the Project Reconciliation bid. He said he doesn\u2019t think it should be open to groups in Saskatchewan or those not directly along the pipeline\u2019s route because \u201cthey have nothing to risk.\u201d\n\nTony Alexis, the co-chair of the Iron Coalition, another group with its sights on the pipeline, said indigenous ownership could serve as a model for future projects. But he cautioned against \u201ctaking a step too quickly.\u201d\n\nHis sense from conversations with federal officials is that they want all of the indigenous-led coalitions to come together and submit a single bid, so they don\u2019t have to choose among several indigenous-led proposals.\n\nTrudeau said last month the government is \u201cvery interested in seeing indigenous partnership and indigenous ownership, potentially, of this pipeline\u201d but is proceeding in a \u201cmeasured way.\u201d\n\nHerbert said the finance ministry has launched a \u201cformal engagement process\u201d to \u201cactively seek input from indigenous groups on ways that they could benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important that indigenous communities have an opportunity for meaningful economic participation while we hold to our commitment of investing in a way that benefits all Canadians, and that operates the project on a commercial basis,\u201d he said.\n\nA federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations confirmed that the government has received \u201cdocumentation\u201d from Wapass\u2019s group.\n\n\u201cProject Reconciliation is obviously very organized and has built some type of capacity,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t think that because they have built that capacity, the resources necessary to have a very detailed plan or the financial backing that they should have priority over groups that are maybe less organized.\u201d\n\nThe official said it was too soon to say when the bidding process would open.\n\n[Canada\u2019s land acknowledgments draw criticism from the indigenous people they\u2019re supposed to honor]\n\nGeorge-Wilson said indigenous ownership of the pipeline makes the project no more palatable.\n\n\u201cWe have looked closely at the economics of the project and in reality, in our view, there\u2019s a lot of risk and uncertainty facing whomever owns it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs expressed similar concerns before Trudeau approved the project.\n\n\u201cThere are good reasons why Kinder Morgan chose to walk away from this project and you should carefully consider them before investing your Nation\u2019s money,\u201d the chiefs wrote to Trudeau in April.\n\nWapass is undeterred.\n\n\u201cI respect their position,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest. I don\u2019t see them driving Teslas.\u201d\n\nA federal appeals court said Thursday it would hear six challenges to the pipeline, further delaying the project. They include George-Wilson\u2019s; she argues that the government still hasn\u2019t adequately consulted with indigenous groups.\n\nCoates said the Trudeau government would be \u201cnaive\u201d to think indigenous ownership would reduce opposition to the project or stave off criticism from environmentalists in an election year.\n\nHe called the situation \u201cironic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to end up with a pipeline,\u201d he said, \u201cit could be because First Nations stepped forward.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTwo percent of the world\u2019s North Atlantic right whales have died in the last two months\n\nCanada\u2019s wildfire season is off to a ferocious start\n\nAs Canadian pipeline plans falter, more oil is moving by rail \u2014 prompting familiar fears\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Some oppose the Trans Mountain Pipeline project.
