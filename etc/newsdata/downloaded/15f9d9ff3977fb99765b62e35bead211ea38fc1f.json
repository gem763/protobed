And two-thirds have considered leaving Australia again.\n\nCheong-Holdaway, his wife and daughter returned to Melbourne, where he consulted (mainly by living on a plane) for a year before he took a job at Jemena at half his previous salary, and several rungs below his last position.\n\n\u201cOne of the hardest things for me was updating my LinkedIn profile to energy analyst. I was an analyst a decade ago \u2026 to be one again was a knock to the ego,\u201d he says, although he is backing himself to jump a few rungs faster than most.\n\nYasmin Allen says companies need to do a better job of supporting returning expatriates. Louie Douvis\n\nOf the more than 1 million Australians living and working overseas, almost half return home within five years.\n\nYasmin Allen, who chairs Advance and is a non-executive director of companies, including Santos, Cochlear and the ASX, says expats are an underused economic resource, whether they are overseas or trying to return home.\n\nAllen, who worked in Britain before coming home as an aviation analyst when Qantas Airways was privatised, says companies need to do a better job of supporting expatriates when they return. But equally, people returning home need to make sure they are plugged into Australia. \u201cYour network does matter, but not to [the exclusion of] all else,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course your experience and background is important.\n\n\u201cThere will always be trade-offs when employing people. Not everyone will exhibit all the desired skills and attributes. Maybe it\u2019s about being more aware of that \u2013 if companies are aware of a weakness, they could backfill to reduce the risk.\u201d\n\nKeeping in touch with her networks at home helped Allen land a job in Australia. She left Britain after being put forward for an analyst role by a former colleague, one of the group of people she contacted each year when she returned for holidays in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever there are some jobs, she says, including those at a chief executive level, that benefit from people who bring career networks along with them.\n\n\u201cOne important benefit of a CEO is the strong network they can attract to the organisation. Look at Santos, for example \u2013 good people follow CEOs in. I do think your network does matter, depending on the role.\u201d\n\nLike Allen, AsiaLink chief executive Penny Burtt says keeping in touch with her network was crucial to landing the type of job she had sought.\n\nAsialink CEO Penny Burtt says she had to grapple with a perception she had come home to \"retire\". Supplied\n\n\u201cI landed very well because I was very deliberate about what would best suit my mindset and capabilities,\u201d Burtt says. \u201cIt is absolutely essential to stay in touch. A lot of expats forget they have to stay in touch.\u201d\n\nWhen Burtt returned to Australia, she was at a different point in her career from Allen and Cheong-Holdaway. She had worked as a diplomat for two decades, serving in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Geneva, then held senior roles at McKinsey & Company and at Visa.\n\nBut Burtt, who has been home for about 12 months, says she has had to grapple with a perception she has come home to \u201cretire\u201d, rather than \u2013 as she sees it \u2013 building out her experience.\n\nShe was also surprised by the focus that one interview placed on her early Australian experience, rather than more recent roles.\n\nAccording to the Indeed survey, recruiters are put off by job applications that assume any knowledge of offshore roles, especially by using little-known acronyms.\n\nKatherine Chapman, a 51-year-old lawyer who returned to Australia with her husband and two children after 18 years offshore, says she has felt like a \u201csquare peg in a round hole\u201d because her CV, which includes heading multinational law firm Freshfields\u2019 practice management in Hong Kong, doesn\u2019t tick the boxes for local recruiters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople are quite nervous if they haven\u2019t done a stint outside of Australia,\u201d she says.\n\nChapman, who came home about six months ago, expected the re-entry to be challenging, but says it has been harder than she and her husband, who is also a lawyer, expected.\n\n\u201cI think flexibility is the key when you\u2019re a repat: for work, travel, hours,\u201d she says, adding that she has restarted her business advisory company while continuing to look for a legal role.\n\nKatherine Chapman returned to Australia six months ago after 18 years away, and was surprised at how much the work culture had changed. Paul Harris\n\nChapman says she was surprised by how much the Australian workplace culture had changed \u2013 for the better, she says \u2013 and by how few companies were prepared to gamble that she would adapt quickly to changes in cultural nuances.\n\n\u201cA lot of the repats really kind of give up after the six months and really struggle,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce you get past the first hurdle and have more conversations and start to build your network, then life\u2019s great. It\u2019s a fantastic, dynamic workplace in Australia now.\u201d\n\nBurtt suspects any worries recruiters have about recommending expats for a role can be overcome when they meet a candidate.\n\nThat belief comes through in the research: while recruiters do see expats as a risky hire, nine out of 10 believe they bring cultural diversity and a thorough understanding of Australian workplace culture to the roles.\n\n\u201cI think there is a gap between reality and perception,\u201d Burtt says. \u201cAnd the prejudice can often vanish when they meet people and see there is real value.\u201d\n\nCheong-Holdaway says it is up to the returning expat. \u201cI feel like if you really want to commit to being back in Australia, you\u2019ve got to back yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t really expect a company to bet on you being able to establish those relationships. I\u2019m backing myself to skip a bunch of levels.\u201d", "description": "New research confirms the widely held view that Australian companies are locking out workers returning from overseas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4837%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_304%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/94f8b2ed998d352a3ea84b23623989ffa94e28bd", "published_at": "2019-08-02"}
