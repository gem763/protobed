As of Friday afternoon, Grey said, his client had not yet received the appropriate medical treatment while in custody.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned about his treatment within ICE custody,\u201d Grey told HuffPost on Friday.\n\nAt a news conference earlier Friday, Grey said Ramirez was \u201cinjured and in need of surgery.\u201d\n\nA portion of the Hard Rock Hotel, which was still under construction in the heart of the French Quarter, collapsed Oct. 12, killing at least three people and injuring 20 others. Through the Wright, Pichon & Grey law firm, Ramirez and four others filed a lawsuit seeking damages for the injuries they sustained when the construction site caved in on the workers.\n\nICE spokesperson Bryan Cox confirmed to HuffPost that Ramirez was currently in custody and awaiting deportation to Honduras. However, he denied that ICE was the agency that arrested him.\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife agents first found Ramirez fishing without the proper license at the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge, 14 miles east of New Orleans, on Monday, according to ICE. From there, he was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol due to an outstanding deportation order from a federal immigration judge dating to February 2016.\n\nA Border Patrol spokesperson told the New Orleans Advocate that USFW agents called Border Patrol agents to the scene when Ramirez could only produce \u201cforeign citizen documentation.\u201d\n\nHuffPost has reached out to USFW for comment.\n\nCox said that any claims that ICE was targeting undocumented workers who were hurt at the construction site were \u201cfrankly offensive and outrageously false.\u201d\n\nRamirez\u2019s custody and pending deportation have left other undocumented injured workers too afraid to seek medical or legal help, according to Grey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to several individuals, and they\u2019re fearful. I\u2019ve spoken to family members, and they\u2019re fearful. They\u2019re in fear that if they come forward, they\u2019re going to be deported, arrested, detained,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the ability to get the help and the medical attention that they need.\u201d\n\nRamirez has been in the U.S. since 2000 and worked in construction for the last 10 years, according to Grey.", "description": "The Honduran is part of a lawsuit with other construction workers who are seeking damages for their injuries sustained from the tragic accident in New Or...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daa738a2000009f1150626e.jpeg?cache=hvojppxitv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
