Britney Spears is back!\n\nNot like she ever left, but you know she has a flair for the dramatic \u2014 so much so that the pop princess quietly debuted three videos on her Instagram on Monday.\n\nIn the caption-less black-and-white videos, Spears showcases her abs, stares seductively into the camera and whips her platinum blonde tresses around like her life depended on it while clad in nothing but a black bikini and fake tattoos \u2014 and all while Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats' S.O.B. plays on.\n\nWhile we appreciate good ole fashioned flexing just as much as the next person, we can't help but wonder what this means. Is this a teaser for the Piece for Me singer's show once her Las Vegas residency resumes? Or did she just stunt on us for no reason? Only time will tell. In the meantime, we'll just be over here, picking up the pieces of our lives.\n\nA video posted by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Jan 25, 2016 at 2:23pm PST\n\nA video posted by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Jan 25, 2016 at 2:26pm PST\n\nA video posted by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Jan 25, 2016 at 2:29pm PST\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Vohy3G", "description": "Is she dropping new music?
