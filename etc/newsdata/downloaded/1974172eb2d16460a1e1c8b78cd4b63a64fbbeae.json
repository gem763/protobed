Hong Kong has its own government, police force, and criminal justice system, but is ultimately overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, which appointed Lam.\n\nRead more: Hong Kong protesters are calling for massive ATM withdrawals in an economic warning to China\n\nWhile the decision to scrap the bill is a step in the right direction, protesters say, it's not enough. 'The withdrawal of the bill is too little, too late, because it is obviously overdue. If it happened two months earlier, I'm sure we would have seen much less bloodshed,\" Bonnie Leung, the Vice Convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, told Insider.\n\nOne demand down, four to go.\n\nProtests that started out as an outcry against the bill have morphed into larger pro-democracy protests, which include five demands:\n\nWithdraw the extradition bill.\n\nThe government should retract its characterization of protesters as \"rioters.\"\n\nLaunch an independent inquiry into police brutality.\n\nRelease protesters who have been imprisoned.\n\nDemocratic elections for Hong Kong.\n\nProtesters have also called for Lam's resignation. While she said in audio leaked to Reuters that she would quit if she had the option, she clarified to the BBC that she hadn't tendered her resignation to Beijing but didn't deny the authenticity of the recording.\n\n\"Now, one demand has been accepted, has been responded, so we may celebrate a bit, just seconds. Of course, we have waited for it for a very, very long time,\" Leung said.\n\nDemosisto, a leading pro-democracy protest group in Hong Kong, also tweeted that the withdrawal of the bill is not enough, saying that the protests have changed Hong Kong irreversibly. \"Democracy, right here and right now, is the only way out.\"\n\nIn July, Lam said the extradition bill was \"dead,\" but did not formally withdraw it. While withdrawal is arguably the simplest of the protesters' demands for the government to meet, officials in Beijing were loath to do so and indicate that the legislation was a mistake in the first place, The New York Times reports.\n\nThe extradition bill is set to begin the withdrawal process in October, when Hong Kong's legislature will meet.\n\nPolice clash with anti-extradition bill protesters after a protest, at Tsuen Wan, in Hong Kong, China August 25, 2019.

But protesters see the IPCC as loyal to Lam; it's headed by Lam appointee Anthony Francis Neoh, the territory's former Securities and Futures Commission chair.\n\nLam also said during a televised address on Wednesday that she hopes to start dialogue with Hongkongers, saying she wishes to \"examine and review society's deep-seated problems and to advise the government on finding solutions,\" according to The Washington Post.\n\n\"Too little and too late now \u2014 Carrie Lam's response comes after 7 lives sacrificed, more than 1,200 protestors arrested, in which many are mistreated in police station,\" protest leader Joshua Wong tweeted Wednesday, referencing a spate of suicides attributed Beijing's inflexibility and adding that protesters are unlikely to see Lam's move as sincere.\n\n\"Whenever there are signs of sending a palm branch, they always come with a far tighter grip on exercising civil rights,\" he wrote, suggesting that more brutal crackdowns are to come.", "description": "Protest leader Bonnie Leung told Insider Lam's move is too late. \"If it happened two months earlier, I'm sure we would have seen much less bloodshed.\"", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d6fda0e2e22af60cc3956c4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
