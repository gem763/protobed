The S&P 500 declined by 1.56% to end the day at 2,893.06. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.67% to 7,823.78. Stocks fell as hopes for progress between China and the U.S. on the trade front dimmed.\n\nStocks fell after the U.S. added some of China's top artificial intelligence companies to its trade blacklist.
