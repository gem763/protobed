The so-called fear index was up about 29% in the first two days of October, which would eclipse the 24.58% gain for the index back in the fourth quarter of 1992.\n\nHelping to stoke bearish sentiment on Wednesday was a private-sector employment report from Automatic Data Processing ADP, -2.37%, which showed that a modest 135,000 jobs were created in September, in another sign that hiring is slowing along with the broader U.S. economy. The data comes a day after the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing survey produced its worst reading since 2009.\n\nEvidence of a slowdown in the U.S. economy also comes amid a persistent Sino-American dispute over tariffs and intellectual property rights between the world\u2019s largest economies.\n\nWorries about Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, and developments related to President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry over allegations that he has been using the power of the Oval Office to undermine democratic elections, were also concerning investors.\n\n\u201cStocks are firmly in the red as fears about a recession have gripped the markets. The dreadful ISM manufacturing reading from yesterday is stilling playing on traders\u2019 minds,\u201d wrote David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, in a Wednesday research note. \u201cThe ADP report added to the worries the US economy is slowing down.\u201d", "description": "U.S. equity markets on Wednesday are ensnared in a two-day tailspin that has pushed the benchmark indexes to one of the worst starts to a quarter since the...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS525_uglyst_ZG_20191002170549.jpg"}
