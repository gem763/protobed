It\u2019s a multi-billion-dollar business. And Planned Parenthood\u2019s newest President\u2014Alexis McGill Johnson\u2014knows it. She oversees the $2 billion leading killer of unborn black lives (an estimated 247 per day) but wants to conjure up some fake history about the pro-life movement being founded in racism. Her recent OpEd in the Wall Street Journal, \u201cIn Defense of Margaret Sanger on Eugenics\u201d, is as honest as Rachel Dolezal is black.\n\nJohnson denies that Sanger promoted eugenics. Sanger didn\u2019t merely promote it; she embodied it as a member of the virulently racist American Eugenics Society and one of its ringleaders. The Negro Project, which Johnson was referring to but did not name, was not an altruistic effort despite the official Margaret Sanger Papers Project\u2019s laughable denial of Sanger\u2019s own documented racism (opposition to legal immigration, anti-semitism, and speaking to KKK and other like-minded gatherings in her autobiography). Its objective was to severely reduce or eliminate the birth rate of poorer blacks. The ever duplicitous Sanger proudly proclaimed, in her article entitled The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda: \u201c\u2026the campaign for Birth Control is not merely of eugenic value, but is practically identical in ideal, with the final aims of Eugenics.\u201d She continued: \u201cPossibly drastic and Spartan methods may be forced upon society if it continues complacently to encourage the chance and chaotic breeding that has resulted from our stupidly cruel sentimentalism.\u201d\n\nThe Negro Project failed. Racially targeted birth control still fails today. It\u2019s why famed voting rights and anti-poverty activist, Fannie Lou Hamer (who was a victim of eugenic forced sterilization), denounced birth control and abortion saying: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the next thing that I don\u2019t buy. I don\u2019t buy distributing birth control pill[s] and legalizing abortion, because they\u2019re talking about us! If you want to abortionize somebody, do it to yourself because I\u2019m going to try to keep the children.\u201d\n\nPro-life Hamer was under no illusion which movement was racist. Ethyl Payne, a journalist for the Afro American, described the freedom fighter as a \u201cpassionate believer in the right to life\u201d and that she \u201cspoke out strongly against abortion as a means of genocide.\u201d Many other black women feel the same way: Dr. Alveda King, Catherine Davis, Day Gardner, Star Parker, Dr. Freda Bush, Connie Eller, Zina Hackworth, Kay Coles James or the late Dr. Mildred Jefferson (who was the first black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School and the co-founder of the National Right to Life Committee) just to name a few.\n\nI\u2019m not fooled either. As the founder of The Radiance Foundation\u2014an organization that launched the first public ad campaign to illuminate the hugely disproportionate impact of abortion in the black community\u2014we\u2019ve seen how mainstream media continues to cover for one of the world\u2019s most eugenic organizations. In NYC, where Planned Parenthood was spawned, more black babies\u2014for years\u2014have been aborted than born alive. In 2014, when Johnson was Planned Parenthood\u2019s Board Chair, there were 1,101 black babies aborted for every 1,000 born alive. Johnson conveniently never talks about that grim reality. Nor does she ever talk about fathers and the massive epidemic of fatherlessness which leads to abortion rates up to five times higher in the black community. I\u2019m a black adoptive father with beautifully brown children. I was conceived in rape yet adopted and loved into a racially diverse family of fifteen. My white pro-life parents weren\u2019t concerned about a \u201cfalling white birth rate.\u201d They wanted to love those who escaped the violence of abortion and were wrongly written off as \u201cunwanted\u201d and \u201cunloved.\u201d They adopted nine non-white children (black and biracial, Native American, and Vietnamese) and one Caucasian child.\n\nThere\u2019s no escaping the truth about Sanger\u2019s brokenness and the vile anti-human ideology she maintained throughout her life. Planned Parenthood regularly celebrates their eugenicist founder. \u201cBirth control itself, often denounced as a violation of natural law, is nothing more or less than the facilitation of the process of weeding out the unfit, of preventing the birth of defectives or of those who will become defectives.\u201d These words from chapter 18 in Sanger\u2019s book, Women and the New Race, define her motivations for \u201creproductive health.\u201d\n\nSanger led the effort to join the American Birth Control (which would later be renamed Planned Parenthood) and the American Eugenics Society (AES) to produce a combined journal. One couldn\u2019t get enough racist and elitist pseudoscience back then. On March 30, 1928 Sanger met with AES secretary Leon Whitney and other members of both organizations to discuss forging ahead together. (Leon Whitney, by the way, would later be praised by Hitler for his 1934 pro-forced-sterilization manifesto: \u201cThe Case For Sterilization\u201d.) At the time of this hopeful venture, AES was led by Madison Grant, the author of the deeply racist and anti-Semitic book, The Passing of the Great Race. According to the New York Times, \u201cHitler\u2019s most valued book on America was The Passing of the Great Race and that Hitler quoted liberally from Grant in his speeches and is said to have sent him a letter describing The Passing of the Great Race as \u2018my bible\u2019 \u201d. The AES rejected Sanger\u2019s offer to merge.\n\nAbortion activists can keep trying to defend Margaret Sanger and the unsevered DNA of Planned Parenthood. Pro-life factivists will keep repeating the truth.\n\nJohnson\u2019s denial of basic historical facts is a pathetic and desperate attempt to rewrite history and project Planned Parenthood\u2019s own inherent racism. An industry that was inarguably birthed in eugenic racism and elitism somehow wants people to believe that the leading killer of black lives isn\u2019t practicing systemic racism but \u201creproductive justice.\u201d Planned Parenthood exemplifies the narrative in The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes. We can see right through your propaganda, though. When you falsely tweet that black women are \u201csafer to have an abortion than to carry a pregnancy to full term\u201d, you do the dirty job of white supremacists, while you wrap it up in a deceptive pink bow.", "description": "Denial.
