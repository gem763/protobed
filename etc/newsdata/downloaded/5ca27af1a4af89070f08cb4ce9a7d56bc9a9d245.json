Nasdaq-100 futures NQZ19, -0.34% , meanwhile, fell 48.25 points, or 0.6%, to 7,812.\n\nOn Friday, The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.21% rose 319.92 points, or 1.2%, to 26,816.59, the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.09% advanced 32.14 points, or 1.1%, to 2,970.27, while Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.34% gained 106.26 points, or 1.3%, to 8,057.04.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter over the weekend to talk up the first phase of a trade agreement with China, first announced Friday afternoon following two days of U.S.-China trade talks, which culminated in a meeting between the president and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nAs part of the deal, the U.S. postponed a planned tariff increase on $250 billion in Chinese imports from 25% to 30%, originally set to take effect Tuesday, in exchange for Chinese promises to buy $40 to $50 billion in American agricultural products annually.\n\nBut even this limited agreement has yet to be put into writing, while thornier issues remain unresolved, including U.S. allegations of intellectual property theft and unfair state subsidies of Chinese businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the threat of higher tariffs still hang over the global economy and financial markets, as a round of 15% tariffs on about $160 billion in consumer goods is still set to be imposed on Dec. 15th, underscoring the continued uncertainty that global business leaders face as they attempt to measure consumer demand and plan investment.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, this \u2018mini\u2019 deal is an encouraging sign, as it reduces the risk that the trade battle escalates into a full-scale cold war,\u201d wrote Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM, in a Monday note.\n\n\u201cHowever, it doesn\u2019t bring the two sides any closer to a \u2018big\u2019 deal \u2013 perhaps even the opposite,\u201d he added. \u201cBy striking this truce, Trump has effectively alleviated much of the pressure on Beijing, meaning that the Chinese leadership won\u2019t be in a rush to make any concessions on the real issues anytime soon.\u201d\n\nEconomic data from China Monday showed the world\u2019s second-largest economy is feeling the effects of the trade war, with exports falling 3.2% in September, and exports to the U.S. falling by 22%. China\u2019s trade surplus, however, rose to $39.65 billion in September, from August\u2019s $34.8 billion, as imports fell faster than exports.\n\nInvestors were also eyeing developments in negotiations over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, after optimism that a deal could be reached rose Friday following productive negotiations between U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on the difficult question of the customs border between Britain\u2019s Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe British pound, however, retreated Monday, after the European Commission said late Sunday that \u201ca lot of work remains to be done\u201d to finalize Brexit, while questions remain as to whether British Parliament will accept a deal negotiated by Johnson.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nTrading volumes may be lower Monday due to the U.S. Columbus Day holiday which closes federal government offices and the U.S. Treasury bond market but leaves the stock and commodities markets open.\n\nShares of Dow component Boeing Co. BA, +1.06% were down 0.3% in premarket trade after the company\u2019s board said late Friday that it voted to separate the roles of chief executive and chairman as the company has struggled to deal with issues related to the groundings of its 737 Max jet.\n\nThe aviation company said Dennis Muilenburg will continue as CEO, president and a board member, while David Calhoun, the current independent lead director, will become non-executive chairman.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% fell to 1.730% from 1.748% late Friday.\n\nIn commodities, crude oil prices CLX19, -1.97% fell about $1.16 to $53.54 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold futures rose GCZ19, +0.77% $10.50 to $1499.10 an ounce. The U.S. dollar DXY, +0.16% , meanwhile, edged 0.2% higher against a basket of its peers.\n\nIn Asia overnight, the China CSI 300 000300, +1.06% rose 1.1%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index HSI, +0.81% added 0.8%. In Europe, shares were mostly lower, as evidenced by the 0.9% decline in the Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, -0.86% .", "description": "U.S. stock-index futures point to a lower start for Wall Street Monday as investors reevaluate the \u201cphase-one\u201d U.S-China trade agreement", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GQ124_china__ZG_20180914163543.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
