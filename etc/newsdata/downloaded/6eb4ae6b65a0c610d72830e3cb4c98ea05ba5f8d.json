Students had returned to the college, and fans packed the gym for the first home athletic event of the year.\n\nAs the teams launched into fall sports competition, the biggest action around campus was the defending national champion volleyball team hosting its first set of matches of the season at an invitational tournament that included four other teams.\n\nThe gym was packed and spirits were high, The Times-News reported.\n\nThe matches ran all day, morning to evening, and one person was hard at work from the time the first athletes arrived to the time the lights turned off at night. He wasn\u2019t a coach, he wasn\u2019t an athlete, and he wasn\u2019t an official.\n\nRichard Bingham, CSI\u2019s athletic trainer, spent his day tucked in the back recesses of the gym, taping ankles and feet, handing out ice and assessing injuries.\n\n\u201cMy philosophy is that I\u2019d rather be bored than busy,\u201d Bingham said. \u201cIn my profession, that\u2019s a good thing. It sucks doing paperwork, but it\u2019s a lot better than treating athletes because that means they\u2019re hurt and they\u2019re not out there doing what they need to do.\u201d\n\nFor a player, getting hurt means pain and frustration. For a coach, it means a change in strategy and an added burden for the rest of the squad. For a fan, it might mean seeing a drop in performance from their favorite team.\n\nMuch of the process takes place out of the public eye. Most people don\u2019t see the physical and mental battles athletes fight to recover, and many are not privy to the efforts of doctors and trainers behind the scenes who work to get athletes back to full speed.\n\n___\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES\n\nWhile athletes confront difficult physical and mental challenges due to injuries, they don\u2019t go through that process alone. Athletic trainers and doctors are there to guide them.\n\nDr. Chad Johnson is a go-to person for many injured athletes in the Magic Valley. Employed by St. Luke\u2019s, he is the only primary sports medicine practitioner in the area, and there are only approximately 3,000 others who can make that claim across the United States.\n\nJohnson sees patients of all ages in Twin Falls and deals with injuries that are non-operative - meaning they don\u2019t require surgery. That includes everything from concussions to ankle sprains to muscle strains.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office also has relationships with four local high schools - Canyon Ridge, Filer, Kimberly (his hometown) and Jerome - and with CSI, where he is the directing physician. He and his staff provide care at high school sporting events.\n\n\u201cOverall, we make sure kids are safe,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen they get hurt, we pull them out, and if we can get them back in the same game, we will.\u201d\n\nThe high school sports season, which runs from late summer through the spring, means more injured patients and more activity. But he said it\u2019s gratifying when he\u2019s able to return athletes to action and show them that taking time to do the recovery process correctly was worth it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the payback comes as a physician or an athletic trainer when they\u2019re overall grateful that we did it right and they go back and play at peak performance rather than limp through their season,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSimilar to the physician\u2019s day, an athletic trainer\u2019s day at the office can be just as long.\n\nBingham arrives at CSI\u2019s athletic facilities between 8 and 9 a.m. and is busy for most of the day. All of the school\u2019s teams are practicing or working out in the fall, even the ones that haven\u2019t started their season yet, so there are plenty of athletes to take care of.\n\nThe biggest rush of activity comes before each one of the team\u2019s sessions, which are spread throughout the day. The athletes come to him to get taped up or receive pre-practice treatment. Then the window between 3 and 5 p.m. is a rush as all of the teams are finishing their workouts at the same time and coming to him with new injuries or issues.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that an athlete receives a significant injury and he has to spring into action.\n\nWhen the Golden Eagles host a home event, Bingham often stays on site until 10 p.m. or later, dealing with any new injuries that come up.\n\nBingham works six-day weeks during the school year and receives only a few weekends off from fall through spring. But he enjoys what he does, especially the aspect of building relationships with so many different athletes.\n\n\u201cOn our teams, we\u2019ve got kids from Africa, South America, North America and Europe, so you get to meet people from all over the world,\u201d Bingham said. \u201cIf and when I ever decide to travel, I can go and stay for free at all of their houses.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFAIR GAME\n\nNo two injuries are the same. Depending on what part of the body is hurt and how badly, treatments range from a bag of ice to full-blown surgery and rehab. The type of sport the athlete plays dictates what kind of injury is likely to occur.\n\nFootball players are prime candidates for injuries because of the physical nature of the game. When athletes are running into each other at full speed, they can break bones, twist ankles and suffer concussions.\n\nOther sports played on grass or turf fields, such as football and soccer, leave athletes especially susceptible to ankle and knee injuries, including catastrophic ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) tears. The ACL is one of four main ligaments in the knee and is important for stabilizing it for cutting and changing directions. It requires reconstructive surgery and sidelines the average athlete for nine to 12 months.\n\nBasketball and volleyball players constantly pound their feet on the court as they run and jump, which can lead to knee, shin and ankle problems that can linger and grow into worse injuries.\n\nBut one particular sport with less movement and more standing around has injury risk, too: baseball.\n\n___\n\nMISHAPS ON THE MOUND\n\nBaseball players aren\u2019t actively colliding with each other like football players, and they aren\u2019t moving as much as basketball or volleyball players. So where is the potential for injury?\n\nThe persistent use of the arm for a pitcher can lead to long-term soreness and injuries, especially if the pitcher is overused.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of safety measures that are put in place, pitch counts and other things to keep these kids safe,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut regardless, when you\u2019re trying to throw balls as fast as you can accurately over and over again, those pitchers hurt their elbows and their shoulders pretty regularly.\u201d\n\nDevin Kunz, the head baseball coach at Burley High School, compares the strain of pitching to money in a bank account.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re throwing overhand and you\u2019re elevated on the mound, that\u2019s basically a withdrawal from your bank,\u201d Kunz said. \u201cEvery time you throw downhill and overhead, you are taking a little bit out of your bank account.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Kunz and his staff have the team - which has won back-to-back Single-A American Legion state titles - do most of its throwing drills on flat ground. They put a lot of emphasis on long-toss, and their pitchers practice most of their throwing on non-elevated surfaces.\n\nThe Idaho High School Activities Association, the governing body for the state\u2019s high school sports, has rules about how many pitches a player can throw in a single day.\n\nFor instance, a varsity pitcher is not allowed to throw more than 110 pitches in one day (if they hit the limit in the middle of an at-bat, they are allowed to finish off the batter). They are also not allowed to pitch on three consecutive days, regardless of how many pitches they have thrown over that span.\n\nThe rules also require a certain number of rest days depending on how many pitches the player threw. For the first 30 days of the season, a varsity pitcher must not pitch for three days after throwing 71 to 88 pitches per day. After those 30 days, the range moves from 86 to 110.\n\nThe IHSAA requires teams to log their players\u2019 number of pitches on the website MaxPreps. If a team violates the pitch count rule, the game where the violation occurred results in a forfeit. If a team doesn\u2019t report a game, the coach can be suspended for two games as a repercussion.\n\nKunz supports the rules in place that protect young players, even if intentional overuse isn\u2019t a widespread problem. He said limiting the number of pitches someone is allowed to throw is better than limiting the number of innings. The time length of any particular inning can vary.\n\n\u201cI think most of the coaches, especially in our area that we know, they\u2019re not going to tear down a kid\u2019s arm on purpose or throw him every inning,\u201d Kunz said.\n\nThe 12th-year Burley coach explained that one of the biggest risks of overuse of the arm is when a player specializes in baseball.\n\n\u201cWhen you only play one sport, whether you\u2019re 10 years old or 15 or 17, and you\u2019re using the same muscles year-round, you\u2019re going to get some wear and tear there,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s why he encourages his players to be multi-sport athletes outside of baseball season.\n\nKunz fought his own battle with injuries when he was a baseball player. He understands the mental challenges of rehab and recovery.\n\nAfter a playing career at Brigham Young University from 1989-90, the Texas Rangers drafted him, and he worked his way up to Double-A in the minor leagues. One game, after throwing a pitch, he felt discomfort in his arm, like hitting his funny bone on a doorknob. The injury was concerning enough that the training staff sent Kunz to Los Angeles for surgery.\n\n\u201cThey put me under, and they said, \u2018Listen man, if you wake up and one arm is wrapped up, that\u2019s a good sign,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201c\u2018If you wake up and two arms are in bandages, that means you\u2019ve got Tommy John, and that\u2019s a whole year off.\u2019\u201d\n\nTommy John surgery replaces the UCL (ulnar collateral ligament) of the elbow, and the procedure requires removing a tendon from somewhere else in the body to use. Since Kunz\u2019s surgery ended up requiring this, his recovery time increased.\n\n\u201cI remember waking up groggy, and I had both arms in the cast,\u201d Kunz said.\n\nHis elbow eventually recovered after a year and he went on to pitch in the minor leagues again, but he dealt with nerve issues that kept him from getting back to his full potential.\n\nThe former player described rehabbing from the surgery as a mental grind. He said the hardest part was having to progress slowly and only do as much activity as the training staff recommended - even when he was tempted to do more.\n\n\u201cWith athletes, that\u2019s what got them there, that drive,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have to tell them to slow down, to chill out and relax, that\u2019s hard. When you don\u2019t feel good, it\u2019s not that hard. But when you feel good, to put the brakes on, that\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPREVENTION IS HALF THE BATTLE\n\nThe athletic trainer\u2019s job isn\u2019t to just provide care once an injury happens. It\u2019s also to prevent injuries from happening in the first place.\n\nBingham said that his job is easier than some because CSI has fewer high-injury-rate sports than some other colleges. There\u2019s less chance for catastrophic injury that way, though the school\u2019s rodeo team offers some occasional gruesome injuries.\n\n\u201cRodeo is as catastrophic as it gets,\u201d he said.\n\nBut regardless of the sport, ankle sprains are a common fact of life, especially with sports played on a court, such as basketball and volleyball.\n\n\u201cOut here on the basketball court, a lot of times the biggest risk factor for an injury is a previous injury,\u201d Bingham said. \u201cThe biggest factor for an ankle sprain is a previous ankle sprain. The more you have, the more likely you are to get another one.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why he strongly recommends ankle braces to CSI athletes. He also works with players to make sure they are warming up and cooling down properly and helps them stabilize their joints.\n\nAt the high school level, the IHSSA has made injury prevention a priority, too.\n\nThe organization and all member schools must adhere to a fall sports practice model. For fall outdoor sports that start practice in the summer heat (football, cross country and soccer), there are limits on practice time and the amount of recovery required between practices, since dehydration, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are all possibilities. Practices can\u2019t be longer than two and a half hours.\n\nWhen it comes to football, the physical nature of the game provides an opportunity for injury. States have their own rules about the amount of contact allowed at practice. In Idaho, that limit is 120 minutes per week. Contact is defined as a drill where the players are running at full speed either up to or through the moment of a hit.\n\nTy Jones, IHSAA executive director, said coaches use common sense in the way they practice today.\n\n\u201cThe days of the coaches that would practice for five hours, line kids up, and go live-action scrimmaging for an hour or an hour and a half are done, and they should be done,\u201d Jones said. \u201cCoaches practice smarter now.\u201d\n\nThe IHSAA also provides injury resources on its website, including a concussion recognition course that it worked with St. Luke\u2019s Hospital to create.\n\nWhile schools generally rely on athletic trainers from outside sources, like local medical and physical therapy providers, Jones said the coaches across the state are prepared and knowledgeable enough to take care of their athletes if the need arises.\n\n\u201cI always tell people that Idaho\u2019s coaches are very well-trained in safety procedures,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously not doctors, but they\u2019re well-trained in safety procedures and looking out for the health and welfare of the kids.\u201d\n\n___\n\nREACTION, RECOVERY AND RETURN\n\nEven with preventive measures in place, accidents can still happen, and athletes get hurt. Both Johnson and Bingham said an athlete\u2019s mentality plays an important role in the recovery process.\n\n\u201cEvery patient I have wants to get better,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen they want to get better, I just have to give them the tools, and they\u2019ll will it to happen.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is when you\u2019re taking care of someone that wants to get better and all you have to do is hold back the reins until they are, they get better fast.\u201d\n\nBingham sees a lot of diversity in how CSI athletes react to their injuries. Some will come to him the moment they feel pain, while others will try to tough it out.\n\nHe said both reactions can be either harmful or beneficial, depending on the situation. He teaches the athletes to distinguish between pain and injury - and that if they don\u2019t speak up about ailments and choose to let their problems linger, they can end up with worse issues down the road.\n\n\u201cIf we would have gotten it taken care of right away, we could have altered your practice for a couple of days - then you would have been fine,\u201d Bingham said.\n\nIf an athlete sustains a significant injury and returns to the field or court after surgery, he or she might not have full trust in the reconstructed ligament or tendon, said Dr. Tyler McKee, an orthopedic surgeon at St. Luke\u2019s in Twin Falls who regularly performs surgeries for sports injuries.\n\n\u201cWhen they tore their ACL or their Achilles, they weren\u2019t doing anything crazy,\u201d McKee said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything they hadn\u2019t done a million times. So it\u2019s kind of a fear that it could happen again. It takes them a while to cut with that same power and confidence.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE\n\nPreston native Julia Nartker, a volleyball player for Treasure Valley Community College in Ontario, Oregon, experienced that drop in confidence after she recovered from an ACL tear.\n\nWhile Bingham taped her feet to help with her shin splints before a match at CSI\u2019s tournament, Nartker recounted how she tore the ligament by jumping and landing awkwardly next to the pole on the court last season. She said the pain in her knee was some of the worst she\u2019s ever felt.\n\n\u201cOn a scale of 1 to 10, it was like a 20,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was bad.\u201d\n\nShe had reconstructive surgery on her ACL and was back on the court in time for her sophomore season, but she said there was some lingering doubt in her mind that her knee would hold up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the back of my mind that I don\u2019t want to injure it again,\u201d Nartker said. \u201cI\u2019ve been reassured by my doctor that it\u2019s fine and it\u2019s super strong, and I shouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nMcKee pointed out that successful recovery from an ACL tear is not only a matter of the reconstructed ligament healing.\n\n\u201cIf the muscles aren\u2019t strong enough, if their reaction time or their balance and stamina aren\u2019t back, we hold them out longer,\u201d the surgeon said. \u201cWe have a few patients who, their graft is ready, but they\u2019re not ready.\u201d\n\nInjuries can strike any active athlete. Johnson said cheerleading is actually one of the sports that keeps him the busiest. Cheerleaders attend other sports year-round, so injury risk is constant, plus flying and stunting makes it a grueling activity.\n\nNo matter how many precautions and safeguards are in place, there\u2019s only one way to completely avoid an injury, Bingham said.\n\n\u201cOne thing I was told many years ago is that there\u2019s only one thing you can positively do to prevent a sports injury, and that\u2019s to not be anywhere near sports, even on the sideline.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times-News, http://www.magicvalley.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There was a fresh energy present on the campus of the College of Southern Idaho on Friday, Sept. 15, one that was not there over the summer.
