Trump Rages in His First Rally Since the Start of the Impeachment Inquiry", "language": "en", "text": "When President Donald Trump took the stage in Minnesota Thursday night, it was his first appearance at a rally since House Democrats formally launched an impeachment inquiry. And he used much of his time on the stage to vent about the proceedings threatening to derail his presidency.\n\n\u201cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed,\u201d Trump told his supporters in Minneapolis at the beginning of the rally.\n\n\u201cThey [Democrats] know they can\u2019t win the 2020 election,\u201d Trump continued, \u201cso they\u2019re pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign insists the impeachment is a political distraction that won\u2019t hurt the President.\n\nThe campaign says it raised $15 million in 72 hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry on September 24.\n\n\u201cAmericans see through the partisan games Democrats are playing,\u201d says Sarah Matthews, deputy press secretary for the Trump 2020 campaign. \u201cDemocrats know they can\u2019t beat President Trump at the ballot box, so they\u2019re trying to deny Americans the opportunity to vote to re-elect him in 2020.\u201d\n\nTrump predicted at his rally that \u201cDemocrats\u2019 brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box, the likes of which they have never, ever seen before in the history of this country.\u201d\n\nBut others close to Trump say his reaction to the impeachment inquiry is less positive. They say Trump\u2019s remarks in recent days show he\u2019s finding little respite from the steady drumbeat of impeachment news coming out of Washington, and also illustrate how the inquiry threatens to dominate his campaign as well as his presidency.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have articles of impeachment voted on him,\u201d a former White House official says. \u201cHe knows that or at least [it] has now sunk in. It is always going to be attached to his name, and it\u2019s driving him insane.\u201d\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s rally, Trump also railed against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, calling Hunter a \u201closer\u201d and saying Joe was only a good Vice President because he \u201cunderstood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d The House\u2019s impeachment inquiry centers on a whistleblower complaint about a call in which Trump may have pressured the President of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nRecent polling suggests the political reality of impeachment may be trickier for the President than he and his campaign staff let on. According to a recent Washington Post-Schar School telephone poll, a majority of the 1,007 Americans surveyed (58%) agree with the House Democrats\u2019 decision to launch the impeachment inquiry, and nearly half of Americans (49%) say the House should go further and recommend Trump\u2019s removal from office. This data is divided along partisan lines, with more Democrats than Republicans supporting impeachment and removal, but in a worrying sign for the President, 57% of independents endorse the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAn Quinnipiac University poll published Oct. 8 found similar results, with 53% of the registered voters surveyed supporting the impeachment inquiry, and 45% of respondents saying Trump should be impeached and removed from office.\n\nA Fox News telephone poll published Oct. 9 had roughly the same figures, noting a \u201cnew high\u201d of 51% of voters who want Trump impeached and removed from office, up from 42% in July.\n\nThe Fox News poll particularly irked the President, who tweeted Thursday morning, \u201cFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck.\u201d\n\nFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nDespite the looming prospect of impeachment, the Trump campaign is making an aggressive play to turn Minnesota and other blue states red in 2020. No Republican presidential candidate has won Minnesota since Richard Nixon did in 1972, but the state went for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016 by just 1.5 percentage points. The campaign hired a state director there in June to target more resources and has seen more Republican voter registrations in recent months.", "description": "Recent polling suggests the political reality of impeachment may be trickier for the President than he and his campaign staff let on", "authors": ["Tessa Berenson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FttStV1pZqCdtd.dm46Lkg--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/6e035d87ed8c9d44f862739feef881b8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
