And relieve the worst burdens on middle class prosperity \u2014 skyrocketing health care costs, tuition and student debt, and the nation\u2019s rickety transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe Obama presidency failed to alleviate most of these or exacerbated problems through blind faith in government or simple inaction. The Trump administration \u2014 and the GOP when it controlled Congress \u2014 has delivered too little.\n\nTruth is that voters are as much to blame as the political class \u2014 they won\u2019t accept the medicine required to cure these ills.\n\nThe average employer-paid family health plan now exceeds $20,000, and millions are losing coverage or simply opting not to purchase insurance. For employers providing decent benefits, these costs make raising wages and investing to add good paying jobs terribly expensive \u2014 and these worsen inequality and slow the progress of women and minorities.\n\nAmericans pay nearly twice as much for health care as folks in other industrialized economies but the latter don\u2019t have the legacy of Washington encouraging \u2014 most recently through the Affordable Care Act \u2014 pricing monopolies in local hospital and medical specialty markets, and enabling the avarice of pharmaceutical companies through permissive Medicare reimbursements.\n\nInstead, our European brethren have established single payer systems \u2014 the U.K. model where patients hardly see money changing hands \u2014 or the German model where prices for drugs and other services are heavily guided by government agencies.\n\nAmericans don\u2019t want to give up their private health insurance \u2014 sorry Sens. Sanders and Warren, single payer plans are out. Strong congressional Republican resistance to price controls with teeth likely reflects the sensibilities of a large enough block of voters and stop those from becoming law in the Senate.\n\nRoads, rails and flood protection all need huge upgrades \u2014 especially in the face of more severe storms. However, raising the gas tax \u2014 frozen since 1993 \u2014 has become the new third rail of American politics, and toll roads have not worked out in many places. Charging the true cost of mass transit and bus service has never been practical \u2014 witness the perennial subsides those require.\n\nStudent debt discourages millennials from starting families and buying homes. Forgiveness of even half the $1.6 trillion in overhang would be a daunting task. Either selling the assets of universities who conned students into believing an expensive liberal arts degrees would yield a job paying well enough to justify the loans or taxes on older generations are required. Neither is popular so nothing happens.\n\nCollege tuition has been rising at three times overall inflation since 1979 but I detect little groundswell for regulations that would force administrators to trim their numbers and student services or compel faculty to educate more and indoctrinate less.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls promise to make as many of these things free by taxing the most successful Americans. Out front, Sen. Sanders offers arguably the most far-reaching agenda and a terribly aggressive wealth tax.\n\nSen. Warren has raised her standing in the polls by railing against big corporations, insurance companies and government, and then asserting she has plans to fix most everything, except perhaps cold Minnesota winters, with funding from her own wealth tax.\n\nIndependent analyses indicate Ms. Warren\u2019s more modest wealth tax would not raise even half the revenue she claims, and none of the socialists in the race consider the consequences of confiscation on longer term innovation and investment.\n\nSooner or later ballooning health care costs will compel solutions, highways will simply collapse and more young people will skip college and graduate school. Employers will discover they weren\u2019t learning much there anyway, hire high school graduates and run training programs and better focused employee tuition plans that deliver more cost-effective results.\n\nIn the end, Americans will likely get either government-run health care or terribly deep subsidies for private insurance, the road and rails repaired and higher gas taxes and fares to pay for it, and perhaps some kind of debt relief and free tuition \u2014 the states are already doing more of the latter.\n\nWithout real reforms, though, average workers can count on forking over half or more of their income and be poorer to pay for it all \u2014 just like the Europeans. Americans won\u2019t be happy but will have little way out.\n\n\u2022 Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
