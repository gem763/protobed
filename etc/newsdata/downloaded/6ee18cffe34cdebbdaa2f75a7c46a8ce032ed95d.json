Fiona Hill, Trump's former top Russia hand on the NSC, briefed Morrison on Giuliani's effort when she left the White House earlier this year, according to a person familiar with their discussion.\n\nMorrison is the third official slated to be interviewed by lawmakers who has resigned ahead of his planned testimony. The others were former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker and Michael McKinley, a former senior aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. NPR first reported that Morrison was resigning.\n\nHe is also the third current or former NSC official to testify in Democrats' escalating probe. The top Ukraine policy official on the council, Alexander Vindman, testified Tuesday. Hill, who left the council earlier this year, testified earlier this month.\n\nDemocrats have also requested testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton and the NSC's top lawyer, John Eisenberg, whose names have come up in testimony by other witnesses.\n\nMorrison will be succeeded by Andrew Peek, a deputy assistant secretary of State in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, who focused on Iraq and Iran policy.\n\nWhile at the State Department, Peek worked extensively on hostage negotiations with Robert O'Brien, now the national security adviser, particularly on Americans held in Iran, such as Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran. O'Brien then was the U.S. special presidential envoy for hostage affairs.\n\nPeek majored in international politics at Princeton University and pursued a master\u2019s in international relations at Harvard University before heading to Washington as a foreign policy researcher for the Heritage Foundation.\n\nIn 2008, he enlisted as a reserve officer in the Army and spent a year in Afghanistan with Gen. David Petraeus, who was then commander of U.S. forces. He ultimately worked for Petraeus's successor, Gen. John Allen, as an adviser and intelligence officer. Peek also has worked for former Sens. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) and Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) on foreign and national security policy.\n\nNatasha Bertrand and Anita Kumar contributed reporting to this story.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fe/a3/1d7d4ec94a56a5f6df24c6812c48/190409-white-house-gtty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
