Cornell William Brooks, a former president of the NAACP, tweeted, \u201cI have preached #forgiveness for 25 years, BUT using the willingness of Black people to forgive as an excuse to further victimize Black people is SINFUL. America should ask Black people forgiveness for serially asking African Americans to forgive sanctioned #PoliceBrutality.\u201d\n\nI have preached #forgiveness for 25 years, BUT using the willingness of Black people to forgive as an excuse to further victimize Black people is SINFUL.\n\n\n\nAmerica should ask Black people forgiveness for serially asking African Americans to forgive sanctioned #PoliceBrutality. pic.twitter.com/OUJzoEYgr0 \u2014 Rev. Cornell William Brooks (@CornellWBrooks) October 2, 2019\n\nYes, we should. If the roles had been reversed, would the white officer\u2019s family have been hugging her black killer? We can\u2019t know, but people of color shouldn\u2019t always have to be the ones showing us how to forgive, as they were also so quick to do after white supremacist Dylann Roof\u2019s shooting spree at Mother Emanuel AME in Charleston, South Carolina. Unlike Guyger, Roof has said he does not regret anything.\n\nForgiveness is a gift you give yourself\n\nForgiving someone does not, though, mean condoning his or her actions. It\u2019s not only a gift you give yourself, but one that you either fork over ASAP or spend the rest of time wishing you had. And it\u2019s only because we humans are so complicated that it\u2019s both more important and in some ways easier to forgive the worst that\u2019s been done to us than it is to let go of the petty slights.\n\nJust a couple of years ago, I finally got to say, \u201cWe forgive you\u201d to the now middle-aged man who, as a teenager, had been riding his motorcycle with my 16-year-old brother John on the back when they hit a pothole. My brother flew off, hit a tree, suffered a punctured lung and suffocated. He\u2019s buried in the Catholic cemetery just up the country road from where he died on July 21, 1979.\n\nDoes everyone deserve forgiveness?: Brandt Jean publicly forgave his brother's killer. Was it too soon?\n\nMy parents always wanted to hug this boy, to make sure he was OK and hear about my brother\u2019s final moments, but his parents wouldn\u2019t let him do that, or even come to the phone. They feared legal action, because apparently he\u2019d been drinking, but I always thought this attempt to protect their son did him a terrible disservice. For years, every time my mom or dad went into the grocery store where he worked, he\u2019d run into the back.\n\nWhen I finally did get to talk to him, and tell him that as far as we were concerned he\u2019d long since been forgiven, he insisted that he hadn\u2019t been driving, though lots of people who saw them that afternoon said that he was. And had John been driving, he wouldn\u2019t have flown off into the tree, would he? This was the first I\u2019d even heard that that was his story, since there wasn\u2019t a police investigation.\n\nBrandt Jean hugs former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger after delivering his impact statement on Oct. 2, 2019, in Dallas, Texas. (Photo: Tom Fox, AP)\n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t conscious when John died, so didn\u2019t know what he said at the end, and that he couldn\u2019t come to the funeral because he was in a coma at the time. That isn\u2019t true either; we know he talked to the ambulance driver, and a number of friends saw him uptown, riding the carnival rides at Ag Products Days, that same night. We didn\u2019t read anything into that; what are you supposed to do with yourself in the hours after your friend is thrown off your bike and dies? Just don\u2019t try to lie about your whereabouts in a small town is my advice.\n\nTalking to him, I was sad that he\u2019s still in denial after all these years. But I was also grateful for the chance to cry with him, and to at least try and set him free from what must have been a harsher sentence than any judge could have imposed. So when I hear people criticizing Jean for hugging Guyger, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re right to want to deny him the comfort of forgiving, which might be even greater than that of being forgiven.\n\nState District Judge Tammy Kemp embracing a tearful Guyger is more problematic, of course. Particularly after some of her rulings for the defense, a big ol\u2019 hug is not what impartiality looks like. Good thing I\u2019m not a judge or I\u2019d be hugging all of the murderers, but really, she shouldn\u2019t have. Still, caught off guard, she behaved like a person, and I can\u2019t blame her for that, either. \u201cForgive yourself,\u201d she told Guyger.\n\nJust as hate leads to more of the same, so too does letting go of it.\n\nMelinda Henneberger is an editorial writer and columnist for The Kansas City Star and a member of the USA TODAY Board of Contributors.
