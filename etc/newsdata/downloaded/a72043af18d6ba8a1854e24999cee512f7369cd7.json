Another US official confirmed to Reuters news agency that the operation took place but did not disclose details and did not say whether it was successful.\n\nNewsweek, citing a US Army official briefed on the result of the operation, said al-Baghdadi was killed in the raid.\n\nUS President Donald Trump plans to make a \"major statement\" at the White House at 9 am EST (1300 GMT) on Sunday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said on Saturday.\n\nEarlier, Trump tweeted: \"Something very big has just happened!\"\n\nMore:\n\nThe US raid was carried out in Barisha, a small village in northwestern Syria near the border with Turkey, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a war monitor.\n\nAl Jazeera's Alaa Eddine Youssef, reporting from Barisha, said eight US helicopters took part in the operation which lasted for about 90 minutes.\n\n\"Search-and-rescue teams are still in the area in an attempt to find out what happened,\" he said.\n\n\"Many were killed and injured, many vehicles were also destroyed. No cameras are allowed in until all the search and investigation efforts are completed.\"\n\nPrior to the US Operation in Idlib Province of Syria last night, information exchange and coordination between the military authorities of both countries took place.#MSB #TSK \u2014 T.C.

It will possibly weaken the group and, at least for a short period of time, until another leader is announced, they might be disorientated,\" she said.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, who led ISIL for the last five years, was long thought to be hiding somewhere along the Iraq-Syria border.\n\nHe remained among the few ISIL commanders still at large despite multiple claims in recent years about his death and even as his so-called caliphate dramatically shrank, with many supporters who joined the cause either imprisoned or jailed.\n\nOn September 16, ISIL issued a 30-minute audio message purporting to come from al-Baghdadi, in which he said operations were taking place daily and called on supporters to free women jailed in camps in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to his group.\n\n170607085701484\n\nIn the audio message, al-Baghdadi also said the US and its proxies had been defeated in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the US had been \"dragged\" into Mali and Niger.\n\nThe strike came amid concerns that a recent US pullback from northeastern Syria could infuse new strength into the group, which had lost vast stretches of territory it had once controlled.\n\nAl Jazeera's Osama bin Javaid said most of the details regarding the US operation were from unnamed US military sources claiming a joint special operation command force, known as JSOC, carried out this operation.\n\n\"The sources say the JSOC had intelligence, they went into a compound and a person detonated himself with a suicide vest. Sources in the US military believe that this was al-Baghdadi,\" he said.\n\n\"We know that al-Baghdadi has not been seen in public since 2014 when he made that famous speech, and came up on the podium in Mosul and declared that ISIL had been formed.\"\n\nAt the height of its power ISIL ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.\n\nDespite losing its last significant territory, ISIL is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria's desert and Iraq's cities.", "description": "Unclear if al-Baghdadi was killed; President Trump to make 'major statement' at 13:00 GMT on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/27/4fbbe3c9c0f041eb96d12949b8b31cd9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
