Potentially, if the walls of our own homes could talk, it might be a dark and bloody tale they\u2019d tell.\n\nIn Australia, real estate agents are required to disclose to buyers if a house has been the site of a recent crime. But, it\u2019s the creepy backstories in times gone by that might surprise you.\n\nWe\u2019ve enlisted the help of Carly Godden, historian, and host of the Dead & Buried podcast, to help dig up the creepy and colourful pasts of some Aussie homes.\n\n1. A gangster murdered by accident at an all-night jazz party\n\nWhere: Blakeney Street, Highgate Hill QLD\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday 20th December 1926, revellers at a late-night jazz party in Highgate Hill Brisbane were disturbed by William Kirby, an underworld gangster who went by the alias William \u2018Spider\u2019 Raper.\n\nDescribed by tabloid newspaper Truth as \u201ca terrorising influence with a thirst for gore,\u201d William worked the Spring Hill area as a conman, extortionist and pimp.\n\nThe white picket-fenced property on Blakeney Street, a \u201cquiet, out-of-the-way thoroughfare,\u201d in the \u201cscattered, rambling locality known as Highgate Hill,\u201d was the home of his former-girlfriend Vera Meskall.\n\nOne night, after overhearing screams outside the home, a 29-year-old boarder named George Ward tried to intervene as William attempted to strangle Vera for refusing to give him money.\n\nFollowing a struggle, William ripped out a fencepost and beat George with it, allowing him to force Vera inside.\n\nThrough the ajar door, George fired a warning shot down the corridor, which struck William and killed him.\n\nThe next day George turned himself in to the police reportedly declaring \u201cI did not mean to do it.\u201d He was tried for murder in the Brisbane Supreme Court but a jury took only 20 minutes to find him not guilty.\n\nWatch now:\n\n2. Death of a former circus dwarf following stabbing by tin opener\n\nWhere: Charles Street, Woolloomooloo NSW\n\nOn the morning of 4th February 1944 retired circus clown, Bob Widgery was found in the gutter opposite his home on Charles Street, Woolloomooloo. He had deep wounds to his neck and later died at Sydney hospital.\n\nBorn a dwarf, Bob had been a headline act who the Arrow newspaper reported possessed a \u201cwit and repartee that seemed to be boundless.\u201d\n\nHis death had been preceded with a raucous all-day party fuelled by \u201ccheap wine\u201d at his two-storey Victorian terrace. When the stock of wine ran out, one of the guests reportedly pawned her false teeth to purchase a fresh supply. Now that\u2019s dedication!\n\nThe police suspected that Bob met his end at the hands of 42-year old coal lumper John Kirkadly who stabbed him with a tin opener during a drunken brawl.\n\nJohn once shared a room with Bob and described him as a \u201cquarrelsome man\u201d. However, the prosecution did not commit him to trial, apparently due to a lack of evidence.\n\n3. Shooting at the hands of a jealous lover while the husband slept inside\n\nWhere: Shakespeare Street Carlton VIC\n\nOn 15 April 1922, Mary Skelton was living with her husband William Skelton in Shakespeare Street when she was shot by her ex-lover, George Quigley.\n\nMonths previously Mary had been staying with her sister when she commenced an affair with George, however, she eventually broke it off.\n\nOn the evening of Good Friday, George showed up at the back door of the Skelton\u2019s home in the hope of persuading Mary to take him back. She refused to even see him and a struggle ensued.\n\nSuddenly Mary felt a sharp sting in her arm and saw blood.\n\nAt trial, one of the neighbours reported hearing a gunshot and the voice of a man saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no harm done. It\u2019s a pity it didn\u2019t settle you.\u201d\n\nGeorge was found guilty of unlawful wounding and sentenced to 12 months in jail.\n\nAbout Dead & Buried\n\nDead & Buried is an award-winning podcast showcasing the hidden history and true crime stories from Melbourne and beyond.
