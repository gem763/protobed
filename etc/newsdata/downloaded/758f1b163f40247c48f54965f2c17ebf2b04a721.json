Nikki Haley, a former ambassador to the United Nations, said the new U.S. policy toward the Kurds amounted to \u201cleaving them to die\u201d in northern Syria.\n\nThe decision, critics said, is likely to have immense consequences for an already volatile region. They said it would strengthen Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\u2019s hold on power, give Mr. Assad\u2019s ally Iran more leverage and directly lead to a resurgence of the Islamic State. Mr. Trump has long complained of forever wars, but the U.S. drawdown appears to leave a major power vacuum that regional powers will rush to fill.\n\nAlso unresolved is the fate of a massive terrorist detention camp run by the Syrian Kurds and the nightmare scenario that thousands of local and foreign fighters who flocked to the Islamic State banner could suddenly be left unsupervised.\n\nMr. Trump made clear online and in multiple public events that he is no longer willing to risk American lives in order to prevent war between Turkey and the SDF, which Ankara considers an ally of a militant Kurdish separatist movement inside Turkey.\n\nSEE ALSO: Mass release of imprisoned ISIS fighters feared as U.S. withdraws from Syria\n\nThe president and other top administration officials said they are in no way supporting the looming Turkish offensive, and Mr. Trump went so far as to threaten to \u201cobliterate\u201d the Turkish economy in the event of an all-out genocide against the Kurds.\n\n\u201cI was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\u2019t even like the USA,\u201d the president said in a Twitter post. \u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said the fallout from his decision was for the countries in the region, not the U.S. military, to determine.\n\nRussia, Turkey, Iran, Syria and Iraq are responsible for securing their Middle East \u201cneighborhood,\u201d he told reporters Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cLet them take care of it, let them take care of it. We want to bring our troops back home.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry appeared determined to move ahead. A statement said Ankara would clear out \u201cterrorists\u201d east of the Euphrates River and establish its own buffer zone to protect its southern border.\n\n\u201cIn this way, a serious threat to the territorial integrity and unity of Syria will be eliminated and a strong ground will be established in order to prevent the recurrence of the terrorist [Islamic State] and similar problems in the future,\u201d ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said in the statement.\n\n\u2018Not going to get in the middle\u2019\n\nRoughly 1,000 U.S. troops are deployed in northern Syria. The American presence began in 2014 when President Obama dispatched U.S. forces as part of a mission to defeat the \u201ccaliphate\u201d established by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision, officials said, will immediately affect 50 to 100 U.S. special operations forces stationed in northeastern Syria near the Turkish border. A joint U.S.-Turkish military mission to police a buffer zone just inside Syria appears to have ended, leaving Ankara free to deal with Syrian Kurdish forces as it sees fit.\n\nA U.S. official briefing reporters said Mr. Trump made clear to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call Sunday night that the U.S. in no way condones the coming offensive against the Kurds, but the official also made clear that it appears inevitable that Turkey will follow through on its threats.\n\n\u201cTurkey appears to be set on undertaking an operation in northern Syria,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe also made it clear that if Turkey undertakes such an operation, U.S. troops cannot be put into any danger.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the remaining American forces will stay in Syria if widespread violence erupts, though administration officials said the president\u2019s ultimate goal is to bring home all U.S. troops.\n\nMr. Trump first announced plans to remove U.S. forces from Syria in December. His decision led to the immediate resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis, though the withdrawal order was modified later.\n\nMeanwhile, the global community is preparing for a brutal and bloody confrontation.\n\n\u201cAny [military] operation that takes place at the moment has to take into account to ensure that we don\u2019t see any further displacement,\u201d said Panos Moumtzis, the U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria. \u201cWe are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.\u201d\n\nThe SDF, which would likely be outmatched by the might of the Turkish military, accused Mr. Trump of abandoning the forces.\n\n\u201cThere were assurances from the United States of America that it would not allow any Turkish military operations against the region,\u201d said SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel. \u201cBut the [president\u2019s] statement today was a surprise, and we can say that it is a stab in the back for the SDF.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials made clear that they expect the Turkish offensive to begin imminently. Indeed, Mr. Erdogan suggested in a speech Monday that strikes would begin in a matter of days.\n\n\u201cWe gave all warnings to our interlocutors regarding the east of Euphrates, and we have acted with sufficient patience,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019ve made our preparations, we\u2019ve completed our operation plans, given the necessary instructions.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision seems to have been born out of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s refusal to continue delaying an offensive against the Kurds. A senior U.S. official told The Washington Times that the administration was determined not to put American lives in the crossfire of an offensive on the horizon.\n\n\u201cThe move that has been announced is about removing our forces from harm\u2019s way. We\u2019re not going to fight the Turkish military over this,\u201d the official said. \u201cIf the Turks are going to go into Syria, they\u2019re going to do it on their own. We are not going to get in the middle of them and the SDF.\u201d\n\nNear universal condemnation\n\nA handful of specialists and lawmakers \u2014 including libertarian Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican \u2014 backed the president\u2019s decision to leave Syria, but the move sparked the kind of near universal backlash rarely seen in Washington. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, and House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, who were locked in a bitter feud over the House\u2019s presidential impeachment inquiry, came together to blast Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI urge the president to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cMajor new conflict between Turkey and our partners in Syria would seriously risk damaging Turkey\u2019s ties to the United States and causing greater isolation for Turkey on the world stage. As we learned the hard way during the Obama administration, American interests are best served by American leadership, not by retreat or withdrawal.\u201d\n\nIn the speaker\u2019s statement, Mrs. Pelosi accused the president of caving to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s wishes.\n\n\u201cOnce again, President Trump is deserting an ally in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman,\u201d she said. \u201cBy turning operational responsibility over to the Turks, President Trump has abandoned our Kurdish partners. This decision poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner.\u201d\n\nThe development underscores Mr. Trump\u2019s strong belief in his campaign promise to end wars in the Middle East and bring American troops home. After the president announced the Syria withdrawal in December, the White House and Pentagon slow-walked the exit amid an outcry from both sides of the aisle.\n\nMr. Trump also has taken fire for his dogged determination to end America\u2019s military involvement in Afghanistan. The administration took the unprecedented step of sitting down with Taliban leaders for peace talks. Those talks fell apart last month after a string of Taliban attacks on American troops but may be reviving.\n\nOn Syria, however, the president appears set on moving forward.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest Republican allies said the decision could come back to haunt the U.S. by fueling a resurgence of the Islamic State. Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said he would bring to the Senate floor a resolution to formally condemn the move.\n\n\u201cThis is a disaster in the making,\u201d he said, adding that the withdrawal would be a \u201cstain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds.\u201d\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming Republican, called the withdrawal a \u201ccatastrophic mistake.\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, Virginia Democrat, cast it as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the Kurds.\n\nStill, the administration said it may be able to persuade Turkey to change course. Pentagon officials said they were encouraging their Turkish counterparts to halt plans for military strikes.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense made clear to Turkey \u2014 as did the president \u2014 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria. The U.S. armed forces will not support, or be involved in any such operation,\u201d said Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman. \u201cIn conversations between the department and the Turkish military we have consistently stressed that coordination and cooperation were the best path toward security in the area.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Guy Taylor, Tom Howell and Lauren Meier contributed to this article, which is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
