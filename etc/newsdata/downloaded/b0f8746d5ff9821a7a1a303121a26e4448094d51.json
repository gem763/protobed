It's the most recent nationwide appraisal of the state of caregivers.\n\n\"Many caregivers [told me]: 'Don't call me an informal caregiver, which is an old term. Call me unpaid,\" Sinha said. \"There's nothing informal about me doing a gastrointestinal tube feed, or maybe helping to ... dress wounds or administer insulin.'\"\n\nIn 2016, Sinha was part of a team to develop a national seniors' strategy. The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).\n\nDonna Thomson with her son Nicholas, husband Jim and daughter Natalie. Nicholas was born with cerebral palsy and other complex medical problems. (Submitted by Donna Thomson)\n\nTheir exhaustive report includes recommendations, such as making the Family Caregiver Tax Credit \u2014 introduced by the Liberals in 2017 \u2014 refundable.\n\nCurrently, caregivers can qualify for a maximum non-refundable tax credit of $4,667 per year, or up to $6,788 if their dependent is eligible for the family caregiver amount.\n\nBut Sinha notes that if caregivers are forced to take time away from work, their income drops, making it more difficult to qualify for the credits.\n\n\"This is not free money,\" he stressed. \"By giving someone, for example, $6,800 a year for the care they're providing, that can save us 10 times that amount if that individual [they're caring for] ends up in a nursing home.\"\n\nThe provinces also offer tax credits for caregivers \u2014 refundable in some provinces, non-refundable in others \u2014 as well as between eight and 12 weeks of Compassionate Care Leave.\n\nParty promises for seniors, caregivers\n\nSo far, five of the six major parties have released portions of their election platforms regarding senior care. But not all of them specifically include proposals for unpaid caregivers.\n\nThe Liberals proposed to widen the eligibility guidelines for the existing benefits and tax credits.\n\nThe Conservatives have promised tax breaks for seniors, including increasing the Age Credit by $1,000 per year, per senior.\n\nBoth the NDP and Greens mention implementing a national seniors' strategy.\n\nThe NDP and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois are calling to make the Caregiver Tax Credit refundable.\n\nThe People's Party of Canada has yet to release policy on this issue.\n\nMarissa Lennox, chief policy officer for the Canadian Association for Retired Persons, says seniors and their caregivers need to be \"top of the list\" of discussions this election.\n\n\"We just feel like no one of these parties has provided a platform that really reflects the profound changes that are happening with this group as a result of longevity, and caregiving is only one component of that,\" she said.\n\nCanada Votes 2019: Compare the policies and promises of the six main parties on this election's pressing issues\n\nAccording to a 2015 report by the Canadian Home Care Association , caregivers are often forced to take leave of absences, turn down job opportunities or even quit their jobs entirely to care for their loved ones.\n\nThat translates to 18 million lost work days, or $1.3 billion in lost productivity, every year, the report says.\n\n\"We hear stories of people that have had to quit the best job they've ever had in order to take care of mom or dad,\" said Lennox.\n\n\"We hear stories about two-income families having to manage to survive on one income, so that one person can stay home and take care of mom or dad, or to take care of their spouse.\"\n\n'No upper limit' to demands on caregivers, says advocate\n\nThe transition can take a great emotional toll as well as a financial one, says advocate Donna Thomson. She co-authored The Unexpected Journey of Caring: The Transformation from Loved One to Caregiver with Dr. Zachary White.\n\nDonna Thomson, left, and her mother Marjorie 'Tootie' Higginson, who died in 2018 at the age of 96. (Submitted by Donna Thomson)\n\n\"If you think of your life as a pie chart, and the caring responsibilities and the number of crises [that arise], that part of your life starts to take over and fill the pie chart and subsume work [and] family,\" said Thomson.\n\nIn 1975, she became her father's caregiver after he had three debilitating strokes. Her son Nicolas was born with severe cerebral palsy that requires complex medical care.\n\nAnd her third call to duty began a decade ago when her mother \u2014 who died last year \u2014 began showing signs of dementia. At the time, she moved from the U.K. to Montreal to help her sister take care of her.\n\n\"There's a big difference between doing shopping for your mother every once in a while, and you know, setting up tube feeds \u2026 particularly [for] people who are home on ventilators,\" she said.\n\n\"The type of nursing that families are expected to take on today is unprecedented. And there is no upper limit to what families will be expected to do in cases of complex care.\"\n\nWritten by Jonathan Ore.
