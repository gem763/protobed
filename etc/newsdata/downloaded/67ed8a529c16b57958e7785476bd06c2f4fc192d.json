It\u2019s Next Door. It\u2019s Getting Worse. Why?", "language": "en", "text": "Wars are not won by targeting the enemy\u2019s generals and leaving their ground forces intact. That\u2019s not a military campaign; it\u2019s not even a serious strategy.\n\nAs Tolstoy notes in War and Peace, the French would still have gone on to invade Russia, even if someone had bumped off Napoleon.\n\nAnd the same rule applies to fighting organized crime groups. You can\u2019t defeat them by just busting top-dog mobsters, while allowing their armies of henchmen to grow and take over the countryside. Somebody always moves up, and from an historical perspective (here\u2019s looking at you, Prohibition), such trickle-down tactics appear futile.\n\nThe powers that be in Mexico, however, would have you believe otherwise.\n\nOur southern neighbor is now home to the second deadliest conflict zone in the world after Syria, according to a recent survey. Although there is some debate about the metrics used in that study, there\u2019s no question that, as of now, the Mexican government is losing the fight against the cartels.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a good reason for it: The so-called \u201cKingpin Strategy\u201d employed by military and police in their fight against the cartels has proven itself almost as effective as holding a pocket magnifier over a termite den under a hot sun. You might focus on and fry a few that way, to be sure, but the rest will go right on happily devouring your house.\n\nA Lack of \u201cPax\u201d\n\nSo far, 2017 has been a very rough year for Mexican crime fighters. The regional security plan established by President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in 2013\u2014which divided the country into five zones and included large-scale military deployments\u2014seems to have backfired. Violence is up by as much as 60 percent in the region that includes Sinaloa, where the crime syndicate formerly run by Joaqu\u00edn \u201cChapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n is based. And homicides have increased sharply in each of the other four security zones as well.\n\nAs opposed to previous spikes in violence, which tended to be localized, the first five months of this year have seen a nationwide rise in murders\u2014putting it on track to be the worst year for drug war mayhem since such records started to be kept in 1997.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind the surging death tolls?\n\n\u201cThroughout the drug war the Kingpin Strategy has been the primary tool of the Mexican government in counter narcotics operations,\u201d David Shirk, director of the Justice in Mexico program, tells The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cThe effect of that strategy has been to cause internecine conflicts among criminal organizations that are vying to fill the leadership vacuum,\u201d Shirk says.\n\nAs cartels fragment, they actually become more violent. And Sinaloa State, part of the region that has seen the sharpest rise in violence this year, is a prime example.\n\n\u201cThe arrest of Chapo Guzm\u00e1n was a major contributing factor to the unraveling of the Sinaloa cartel,\u201d Shirk explains, referring to the erstwhile \u201cPax Sinaloa,\u201d which kept other groups in line. The takedown of Chapo \u201chas allowed for other organizations to rise,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cIf this is what we get when we take out Chapo Guzm\u00e1n, I think the average Mexican citizen might question whether it\u2019s worthwhile going after kingpins.\u201d\n\nThe splintering of major cartels into small and fractious rival gangs also has accelerated of late, leading to a dog-eat-dog mentality that pits well-armed cartel units against each other in vicious turf wars. Once the gloves come off nobody is safe, and civilians\u2014and especially journalists\u2014have become popular targets.\n\n\u201cIf you continue to go after the top guy, [like] Chapo Guzm\u00e1n, you should expect to see another Chapo with a different name, but the same MO, in a very short period of time,\u201d says Shirk, who is also a professor at the University of San Diego. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve taken out Chapo the question is who\u2019s the next kingpin we\u2019ll have to take out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHell on Earth\u201d\n\nThe fight over plazas \u2014or individual zones dominated by a certain cartel\u2014involves much higher stakes than just narcotics production or shipping routes. Syndicates within a given plaza often control most of the illicit activity that goes on in the territory, including extortion of business owners, prostitution, and even black market organ trafficking.\n\n\u201cThe narco trafficking world is changing,\u201d says Emmanuel Gallardo, a Mexico City-based journalist who specializes in frontline coverage of the drug war conflict. Gallardo describes the new, diverse and multi-faceted business models that have emerged as being \u201clike a franchise\u201d with different subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a tree and they have branches\u201d for each money-making interest, says Gallardo, in a phone interview with The Daily Beast. Another alteration he points to in the cartel landscape is the increased use of teenaged males as foot soldiers.\n\nSo many of these new sicarios (hitmen) are very young, and they have no education. They have it in their minds that to be a sicario is much better than to be working in a factory. They want a truck to show off, or a new cell phone\u2014it\u2019s part of the culture.\u201d\n\nMexico \u201chas new generations of kids that are growing up in the middle of an armed conflict,\u201d he says.\n\nOne of Gallardo\u2019s regular beats is the Tierra Caliente (Hot Lands) region, in western Mexico. The Hot Lands have been wracked by \u201copen warfare\u201d in recent months, Gallardo says, as the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) has pushed into the region, displacing older groups like the Knights Templar.\n\nThe population of Tierra Caliente \u201cis tired of the cartels treating them like serfs. They kidnap women and use them as sexual slaves, and when they are tired of them they kill them and throw the bodies in the sierra,\u201d Gallardo says.\n\nIn places like Tierra Caliente, individual warlords with names like \u201cThe Fat One\u201d or \u201cThe Fish\u201d rule entire communities like their own personal fiefdoms.\n\n\u201cThey use little towns as headquarters, and from there they dispatch units to take over more territory,\u201d Gallardo says. \u201cIt really is hell on earth.\u201d\n\nFailure of Democracy\n\nMexico is a wealthy nation, boasting major reserves of valuable minerals and oil, a booming tourist trade, and dozens of lucrative\u2014and taxable\u2014global companies.\n\nAnd yet \u201c40 percent of Mexicans live in poverty,\u201d according to Duncan Wood, a security analyst with the Wilson Center. And those squalid conditions create a perfect recruiting ground for the cartels\u2014especially in remote areas of the country.\n\n\u201cThe Mexican government has been unwilling or unable to dedicate the resources required to solve the [security] problem in rural areas and smaller towns,\u201d says Wood. While the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration has had marginal success in going after figureheads like Chapo Guzm\u00e1n, it\u2019s done little or nothing about \u201cthe underlying conditions that facilitate crime and violence in the country.\u201d\n\nWood also blames the \u201cweakness of local and state-level institutions\u201d for the rising tide of violence engulfing vast swaths of Mexico, and suggests that a whopping \u201c70 percent of Mexico\u2019s mayors are directly or indirectly involved with organized crime.\u201d\n\nCrime groups operating in the hinterlands like Tierra Caliente, \u201ccan operate with impunity at the local level because they know there is very little authorities are going to do to stop them,\u201d Wood says.\n\nPolice in such regions are \u201ccompletely outgunned.\u201d\n\n\u201cA local organized crime group will come in and say to local authorities: \u2018Either you take the bribe or we come in and kill you and your families.\u2019 There\u2019s no one who\u2019s going to back them up.\u201d\n\nThe failure of accountability isn\u2019t limited to remote towns and villages, Wood adds. It starts at the top:\n\nThe [Pe\u00f1a Nieto] administration ran out of steam about a year ago,\u201d thanks to a combination of \u201callegations of corruption at the highest level, [and] a damaged reputation due to Ayotzinapa,\u201d Wood says, referring to the disappearance of 43 student teachers in troubled Guerrero state.\n\n\u201cThe political capital of this government is very rapidly dissipating,\u201d he says.\n\nJournalist Gallardo puts it more bluntly:\n\n\u201cCorruption is the cancer that affects everything,\u201d he says. \u201cLaw in Mexico is like a fucking circus. Nobody respects the law here.\u201d\n\nDavid Shirk, of the Justice for Mexico program, agrees that a lapsed regard for due process is at the root of the problem: \u201cIn a functional democracy, you\u2019ve got to have an expectation that the laws will be enforced, especially when a person in government violates the law.\u201d\n\nShirk goes on to mention that Mexico\u2019s current, one-term limit for politicians allows many to get off scot-free for their crimes. \u201cYou can win the governorship, steal as much money as you possibly can, and go live in Italy,\u201d Shirk says, since re-election opportunities provide no incentive for good conduct.\n\nThe Wilson Center\u2019s Wood, who travels regularly to Mexico for work, says the current security crisis it\u2019s facing will be difficult to resolve without first tackling widespread inequality.\n\n\u201cThe heart of the problem [in Mexico] is this: Wealth is concentrated in too few hands.\u201d\n\nWood describes a \u201cwealthy country with an extraordinarily high concentration of billionaires\u201d that has nevertheless \u201cfailed over generations to empower the poorer classes and make them feel like they\u2019re part of the system.\u201d\n\nThat failure also works to the advantage of los narcos .\n\n\u201cYou combine inequality with ineffective government,\u201d says Wood, \u201cand you have a very toxic situation where organized crime is an alternative for young men\u2014but it\u2019s also a force that very few governmental actors are willing to confront.\u201d\n\nUntil Mexico runs out of poor and desperate campesinos (the word literally means \u201cpeasant\u201d in Spanish), the cartels will never be short of troops to use as cannon fodder in their battles over plazas .\n\nTop leaders may be hunted down and arrested\u2014but others will instantly rise up to take their place at the top of the pecking order. The names of the groups might change\u2014as with the upstart CJNG, which broke away from Chapo Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s old outfit, and is now one of the fastest-growing and most powerful crime syndicates in the country\u2014but toes by any other name still smell like feet.\n\n\u201cPoverty, impunity, corruption, lack of education and human rights\u201d: drug war correspondent Gallardo runs down the list of reasons the cartels now have Mexico on the ropes. \u201cAs a country, we\u2019re now paying the price for forgetting communities in the middle of nowhere.\u201d\n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t see the cartels weakening their death grip on Mexico\u2019s heartland any time soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change in 10 or 20 years,\u201d he says, \u201cunless there is a revolution.\u201d", "description": "With violence at \u201chistoric levels,\u201d and no end in sight, it\u2019s time to ask: What\u2019s gone wrong in Mexico?", "authors": ["Jeremy Kryt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1496524374/170604-kryt-mexico-warzone-hero_ngrcer", "published_at": "2017-06-04"}
