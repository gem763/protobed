Bush's Iraq invasion \"may have been the worst decision\" in presidential history on Thursday, but he's no longer willing to say the war was based on a lie.\n\nTrump, speaking at a nationally televised CNN town hall, said the younger President Bush went to war in Iraq to complete a mission that had been begun by his father, President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cFrankly I think the son, being loyal to the father, I think he really wanted to go into Iraq, even if it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do,\u201d Trump said. He suggested the invasion was the basis of the current international problems from Europe to the Middle East.\n\n\u201cIt started ISIS, it started Libya, it started Syria,\u201d Trump declared flatly.\n\n\u201cEverything that\u2019s happening started with us stupidly going into the war in Iraq\u2026.and people talk about me with the button. I\u2019m the one that doesn\u2019t want to do this, okay?\u201d he added.\n\nTrump has been aggressively attacking George W. Bush over the Iraq war since Saturday night's debate, using it to attack his 2016 rival Jeb Bush.\n\nBut Trump, famously loathe to apologize in the face of controversy, did hedge on one of the most explosive claims he made during the debate: that the Bush administration deliberately misled the country in the run-up to war.\n\n\"They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction,\" Trump said Saturday night.\n\nAsked repeatedly by an audience member and moderator Anderson Cooper whether he stood by those comments, Trump declined to give a direct answer.\n\n\"Well a lot of people agree with what I said and I\u2019m not talking about lying, I\u2019m not talking about not lying\" Trump said. \"Nobody really knows why we went into Iraq.\"\n\nThe Iraq exchange was just one of many quips, insults, and news nuggets that Trump offered up in 45-minutes of conversation with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and voters in Columbia, two days ahead of the South Carolina primary.\n\nThe made-for-TV event was a reminder that Trump is a professional television showman who has been doing interviews before a live audience for decades.\n\n\u201cI get a lot of publicity but I don\u2019t necessarily like it,\u201d Trump feigned.\n\nAmong the other highlights:\n\n-- Trump was confronted with a BuzzFeed story showing that Trump had, in 2002, said \u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d when asked about invading Iraq. Trump didn\u2019t skip a beat in saying, \u201cI could have said that\u201d on Thursday before trying to wash away his old comments by saying, \u201cBy the time the war start I was against the war.\u201d\n\n-- In the day\u2019s other controversy, Trump said he would meet with Pope Francis \u201cany time he wants\u201d after a public spat Thursday in which the Pope suggested Trump was \u201cnot Christian\u201d for his support for building a wall with Mexico. \u201cHe\u2019s got an awfully big wall at the Vatican,\u201d Trump said, adding he believed the Pope\u2019s words had been misinterpreted and magnified by the media. Trump said has a \u201cgreat respect for the position\u201d of the papacy and said the current pope has \u201ca lot of energy\u201d \u2014 a high Trump compliment \u2014 and \u201ca lot of personality.\u201d\n\n-- Trump also continued to rail against Sen. Ted Cruz, calling him dishonest. \u201cHe holds up the Bible and then he lies. I think it\u2019s very inappropriate,\u201d he said. In particular, Trump hit Cruz for a photo-shopped picture that showed Marco Rubio shaking hands with President Obama. But Trump then indirectly swiped at Rubio\u2019s height. \u201cIn fact, they even made Marco a lot shorter than he is, if you look at it really,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure that's probably the thing that bothered him the most. He was like very small. I mean he\u2019s not that small. Not too big, but he\u2019s not so small.\"\n\n-- Trump said he would likely include Democrats and those he disagrees with in senior administration roles. And he offered up this classic Trump answer on strike deals: \u201cI believe in compromise where I win.\u201d\n\n-- When it comes to trail eating, Trump said he likes McDonald\u2019s and other chain restaurants because they are hygienic. \"I like cleanliness. I like clean,\" he said. He noted he\u2019d recently visited another chain: \u201cKentucky Fried Chicken \u2014 not the worst.\u201d\n\n-- Trump also waded into some unusual territory, calling Michael Jackson\u2019s plastic surgeries botched: \u201cJust unbelievable.\u201d\n\nTrump used a similar phrase, one of his favorites, to describe his plan to replace President Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be unbelievable,\u201d he pledged.", "description": "Trump, speaking at a nationally televised CNN town hall, said the younger President Bush went to war in Iraq to complete a mission that had been begun by his father, President George H.W.
