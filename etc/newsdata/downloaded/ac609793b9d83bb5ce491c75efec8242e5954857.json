In the past 24 hours alone, TRX/USD has gained almost 25%.\n\nCEO Justin Sun had announced a major, as yet unknown, partnership with what he called a \u201cmega corporation\u201d on the same day as Xi\u2019s speech.\n\nNo. 1 App Store app educates on Bitcoin\n\nIn a further development, cnLedger added that Xuexi Qiangguo, China\u2019s most downloaded app on Apple\u2019s App Store, will feature educational content on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).\n\nWhile the exact nature of its content remains unclear, it forms part of a recommended course \u201cfocusing entirely on blockchain.\u201d\n\nCPS News, a media service run by Xi\u2019s Communist Party of China, has also released a tool helping party members familiarize themselves with the technology.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, China recently unveiled various use cases for blockchain, including cross-border finance.", "description": "Even Bitcoin is getting an endorsement in an official app in China as local media claims platforms are removing anti-blockchain content", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYmM1ZDQwNzg2MmUxZDRiOTRiOWU4ZmEyNWZhZmYzMDMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
