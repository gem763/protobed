What's up?\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAnother said: \"They are all fighting for dominance when Piers is missing.\"\n\nA third tweeted: \"Well that was a waste of what could have been an interesting interview. Where's Piers when you need him and get rid of 'soft Susannah'?\"\n\nThis was echoed by a fourth fan who commented: \"Come back Piers and quickly,\" while a fifth asked: \"Have I missed it ? Has Piers been sacked?\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nOthers claimed they had switched off and tuned into the BBC, not happy with the show line-up.\n\nThere were viewers who were happy to see a lack of Piers content though, with one fan tweeting: \"Turned back to @GMB this morning. Interviews where guests are allowed to speak and the show isn\u2019t merely a vehicle for the host\u2019s right-wing propaganda is definitely more enjoyable.\n\n\"I\u2019d watch this every morning. Piers who?\"\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.", "description": "Some Good Morning Britain viewers are asking for him to return amid a petition from others for him to be axed", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650926.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RLP_MDG_18469JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
