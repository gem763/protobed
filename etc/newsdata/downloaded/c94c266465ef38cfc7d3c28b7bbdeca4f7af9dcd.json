Joonis Korpisalo turned away 30 shots to net his third win.\n\nBen Bishop made 32 saves for Dallas, who have lost four straight.\n\nZach Werenski got the scoring started at 7:42 of the first, while Wennberg made it 2-0 at 15:01.\n\nDallas Stars' Jason Dickinson, left, and Columbus Blue Jackets' Emil Bemstrom, of Sweden, chase the puck during the second period of an NHL hockey game Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2019, in Columbus, Ohio. (AP Photo/Jay LaPrete)\n\nMiro Heiskanen cut the lead to 2-1, scoring his second goal of the year for the Stars on a delayed penalty.\n\nMilano gave Columbus insurance at 9:07 of the third with a highlight-reel goal, skating between two defenders and shooting from between his legs to go top shelf over Bishop. Jakob Lilja recorded his first NHL point with the primary assist.\n\n\"It was the best angle to get on net, and it went in,\" Milano said. \"I was thinking maybe to backhand it, but it went through the legs.\"\n\nColumbus coach John Tortorella called the goal \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"He made a great move to enter the zone, beats a forward at the blue line and there were still two checkers coming on him,\" Tortorella said. \"It's a hell of a goal.\"\n\nJoe Pavelski scored with 4.5 seconds remaining, but it was too little too late.\n\nThe Stars, who have been hindered by poor starts, came out strong, outshooting the Blue Jackets 17-11 in the first. Columbus had a 9-6 shot advantage through a scoreless second period and continued to dominate in the third.\n\n\"I thought we had an excellent first period,\" Dallas coach Jim Montgomery said. \"I thought we were skating. I didn't love our puck management in the second. I thought in the third we were working, trying to tie it up. We gave up too many odd-man rushes. We didn't do it together enough. There were a lot of positives to build off of.\"\n\nBishop agreed.\n\n\"As frustrated as we are, there is still 90% of the season left,\" Bishop said. \"There is still time to fix this ship, but it needs to be more urgency from everybody. We have to find.a way to get the W. No matter what it is.\"\n\nNOTES:\n\nForward Corey Perry returned to the Stars after recovering from a broken foot. ... Werenski's 40 career goals put him one away from tying Rostislav Klesla for the all-time Columbus record among defensemen. ... Longtime Blue Jackets announce Bill Davidge took a break from his Florida retirement to watch his old club, this time from the stands.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nStars: visit Pittsburgh on Friday.\n\nBlue Jackets: visit Chicago on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nDallas Stars' Alexander Radulov, left, of Russia, and Columbus Blue Jackets' Nick Foligno chase the puck during the first period of an NHL hockey game Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2019, in Columbus, Ohio.
