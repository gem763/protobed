Gavin Newsom ended a Wild West-era law Wednesday that made declining to help a police officer a crime.\n\nThe governor signed State Senate Bill 192 that repealed the 1872 California Posse Comitatus Act, commonly used by police in the new frontier to create posses and hunt criminals.\n\nThe law punished any \u201cable-bodied person 18 years of age or older\u201d for refusing a police officer\u2019s request in helping to make \u201can arrest, retaking into custody a person who has escaped from arrest or imprisonment, or preventing a breach of the peace or the commission of any criminal offense.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Bob Hertzberg submitted the bill in January as part of his office\u2019s efforts to remove outdated laws from the California law books.\n\n\u201cThank you to my interns for finding a law that belongs in the history books, not the law books,\u201d Mr. Hertzberg said, according to CNN.\n\nThe law\u2019s repeal has been met with opposition from the California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association, which said it can dissuade citizens from helping police altogether and interfere with public safety.\n\n\u201cWe are unfamiliar with concerns with this statute other than it was enacted many years ago and carries a fine for a person who disobeys it,\u201d CSSA said in a June statement.\n\n\u201cThere are situations in which a peace officer might look to private persons for assistance in matters of emergency or risks to public safety, and we are unconvinced that this statute should be repealed,\u201d the group said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
