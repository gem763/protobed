REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nThis week\u2019s events are intended to raise awareness ahead of a global \u201cclimate strike\u201d on Friday, when students and workers around the world are being encouraged to walk out of schools and jobs to demand action on global warming and pressure leaders due to attend the annual United Nations summit later this month.\n\n\u201cPlease save your praise. We don\u2019t want it,\u201d Thunberg told the Senate Climate Change Task Force. \u201cDon\u2019t invite us here to tell us how inspiring we are without doing anything about it because it doesn\u2019t lead to anything.\u201d\n\nThe 16-year-old has inspired millions of students and others to join her weekly strikes to demand action to fight climate change - dubbed \u201cFridays for Future.\u201d She has been nominated for a Nobel Prize.\n\nDemocratic Senator Ed Markey, chairman of the task force, called the growing number of young protesters the new \u201cX-Factor\u201d in politics, and said their passion could play a significant role in next year\u2019s U.S. presidential elections.\n\n\u201c2020 is going to be a referendum on climate change,\u201d Markey told a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cIt will be a referendum between Donald Trump and a whole new Green New Deal direction.\u201d\n\nThe Green New Deal is a non-binding congressional resolution Markey co-sponsored with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow Democrat, that aims to transform the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels within a decade.\n\nRepublican lawmakers and Trump administration officials have pilloried the plan as fantasy.\n\nPresident Trump, one of the few world leaders who openly question the science of climate change, has made a priority of rolling back Obama-era climate protections he says are not necessary and hurt the U.S. economy.\n\nAnaiah Thomas, a 17-year-old climate activist and member of U.S.-based youth movement Zero Hour, told the senators they need to take an urgent approach to climate change and support proposals like the Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most important is to decide to take action today. Not in five years. Not gradually. Not tomorrow,\u201d she said.", "description": "Swedish teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg on Tuesday called for action, not praise, from U.S. lawmakers as she joined other youth leaders in kicking off two days of meetings and speeches on Washington's Capitol Hill.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430945749&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1LL", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
