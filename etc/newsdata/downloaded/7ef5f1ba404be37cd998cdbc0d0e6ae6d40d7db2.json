Rendon\u2019s deal would reportedly be paid off in full within seven years after the contract expired.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 offer is also less than third baseman Nolan Arenado\u2019s eight-year, $260 million extension with the Colorado Rockies. Arenado agreed to the deal in February and was seen as a potential benchmark for Rendon\u2019s next contract.\n\nThis season, Rendon has performed at an MVP-like level. The 29-year-old hit .319 with 34 home runs and 126 RBIs, all career-highs. He is considered to be a candidate for the National League MVP award alongside Los Angeles\u2019 Cody Bellinger and Milwaukee\u2019s Christian Yellich.\n\nIf Rendon hits the market, a number of teams are expected to be interested in his services.\n\nLike Harper, Rendon is represented by agent Scott Boras.\n\nThe Nationals host the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL wild-card Tuesday at Nationals Park.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
