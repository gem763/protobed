While Vinatieri avoided saying anything too specific, it doesn't take much effort to read between the lines.\n\nVinatieri had a brutal start to the season with the Colts. In the team's opening game against the Chargers, Vinatieri missed two field goals and one extra point in a game they would go on to lose in overtime.\n\nOn Sunday, Vinatieri missed two more extra points, leaving the Colts vulnerable to a last-second drive from the Titans.\n\nThankfully for Vinatieri, his misses didn't cost the Colts the game this time, as the Indianapolis defense was able to hold off the Titans on the final drive of the game.\n\nStill, two games into the season, Vinatieri has cost his team one game and nearly cost them another. While the Colts voiced support for Vinatieri after their Week 1 loss, after another week's worth of struggles, it sounds like Vinatieri might be ready to hang up his cleats on his own.\n\nVinatieri will go down as one of the greatest kickers to ever lace up in the NFL. He's a 24-year veteran of the league but played for just two teams \u2014 the Colts and the New England Patriots \u2014 for the entirety of his career. He's a four-time Super Bowl champion, having made some of the biggest kicks the NFL can offer, including a 48-yard game-winner as time expired in Super Bowl XXXVI to give the Patriots their first title and start the greatest dynasty in league history.\n\nJags star Jalen Ramsey and head coach Doug Marrone get into shouting match and had to be separated on sideline\n\nAntonio Brown scores his first touchdown with the New England Patriots\n\nAlabama running back Najee Harris hit the truck stick, hurdled a defender, and shouted out Megan Rapinoe to score the most spectacular TD of the college football season so far\n\nFire erupts on Tennessee Titans field before NFL game when a pyrotechnics device malfunctioned", "description": "After two missed extra points on Sunday, veteran kicker Adam Vinatieri might be hanging up his cleats.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7eaa842e22af063a5c2eb5-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
