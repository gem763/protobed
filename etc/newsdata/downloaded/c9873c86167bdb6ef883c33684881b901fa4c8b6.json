McCarron. The junior now has 81 for his career and leads the nation with 27 on the season.\n\nTagovailoa shrugged off setting the school record to focus on the importance of beating Alabama\u2019s first ranked opponent of the season.\n\n\u201cYou just revert back to your training. I\u2019ve experience playing at a place like Tennessee, then going to LSU, Ole Miss \u2026 Everyone wants to beat Alabama,\u201d Tagovailoa said. \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet, as a team we have to continue to grow.\u201d\n\nAlabama (6-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) trailed briefly when Texas A&M; scored a touchdown on its first possession.\n\nTagovailoa then engineered four consecutive scoring drives, which included three touchdown passes that all came on third down, and the Tide were on cruise control against the best pass defense they had faced so far this season. The only blemish was the interception thrown in the Texas A&M; end zone late in the second quarter.\n\nTagovailoa spread the scoring around, with all of his TD strikes going to different receivers. His two longest of the day were a 47-yarder to DeVonta Smith in the first quarter and a pinpoint 33-yarder to Henry Ruggs III in the third.\n\n\u201cI feel I have a relationship with everyone, a good connection with everyone,\u201d Tagovailoa said.\n\nAlabama didn\u2019t have to punt until there was less than 2 minutes left in the third quarter. Najee Harris rushed for 114 yards.\n\nJaylen Waddle scored Alabama\u2019s first touchdown on a 31-yard catch-and-run when he shook four defenders, and he also had a big day on punt returns with four for 128 yards.\n\nKellen Mond passed for 264 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a score for the Aggies (3-3, 1-2).\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nAlabama: The Tide\u2019s young defense recorded five sacks but was prone to giving up some big plays that kept the Aggies hanging around into the fourth quarter. Alabama had the game all but put away after Tagovailoa\u2019s fourth touchdown pass made it 34-13, but a penalty negated an interception before blown coverage allowed a wide open touchdown pass. But with Tagovailoa running the offense as he\u2019s doing, it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nTexas A&M;: A brutal schedule keeps beating up the Aggies. Texas A&M; lost its second game to a top-ranked opponent this season. The Aggies lost to then-No. 1 Clemson on Sept. 7. Texas A&M; is one of just five schools to face the No. 1 team twice in a season since the poll began in 1936, having also done it in 1970. \u201cYou kind of look back at the games we won and the games we lost. We feel like we can play with everyone,\u201d Mond said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAlabama hosts Tennessee on Oct. 19.\n\nTexas A&M; travels to Mississippi on Oct. 19.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball /and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdowns and Alabama's offense kept rolling in the Tide's first game at No. 1 this season with a 47-28 victory over No. 24 Texas A&M on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Vertuno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/alabama_texas_a_m_football_82914_c0-133-3183-1989_s1200x700.jpg?2a9b399a774692471e51c4a8fd8656ae6013b3d7", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
