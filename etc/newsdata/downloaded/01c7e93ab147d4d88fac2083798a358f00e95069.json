Rio may produce lithium from borates waste", "language": "en", "text": "Lithium is increasingly in demand from manufacturers of the modern lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles, but a huge increase in supply of the lightweight metal from Australia has crushed lithium prices over the past 18 months.\n\nASX-listed lithium producer Orocobre confirmed on Tuesday that its received prices had more than halved over the past year, and the company predicted they would continue falling in the final three months of 2019.\n\nThat gloomy backdrop has not dimmed Rio's enthusiasm. The fact Rio's Californian material has already been mined for production of borates means the company might be able to produce lithium cheaper than rivals who have to dig it up, or extract it from salt lakes as Orocobre does.\n\n\"The material being used has already been mined, so this will be a low-energy option for the production of lithium,'' said Mr Baatar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great example of the innovative thinking we are encouraging, to look at extracting additional value from our tailings, look outside our traditional commodities and not be afraid to try new approaches.\u201d\n\nRio is spending $10 million on a pilot plant in California in a bid to expand on the work to date, and the next decision will be whether to spend $50 million on a plant capable of producing 5000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRio chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques has flagged a desire to get more exposure to the minerals that make up lithium-ion batteries, saying last year that he believed in climate change and believed that the world would transition towards electric vehicles.\n\n\"We are looking at a few minerals in relation to batteries,\" he said in August 2018.\n\nWhile it is small compared to Rio's flagship iron ore business, Rio's borates business has been a reliable source of cash in recent years, contributing net earnings of between $US111 million ($161 million) and $US126 million in each of the past three years.\n\nBorates are used in glass manufacturing, ceramics, fertiliser and cleaning products among many other uses.\n\nThe link between the borates and lithium will not be a surprise to Rio's Australian investors. Analysts warned earlier this year that Rio might hurt earnings at its Californian borates business if it pushed ahead with swift development of its Jadar project in Serbia, which will produce both lithium and borates.\n\nTailings trend\n\nIt is not the first time a mining company has sought to profit by sifting through waste piles. ASX-listed New Century Zinc has sought to become a major zinc producer by reprocessing the mine wastes, or tailings, left behind by MMG Limited at Queensland's Century mine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNews of Rio's lithium trial came as Orocobre said it sold its lithium carbonate from Argentina at an average price of $US7111 per tonne in the three months to September 30.\n\nIt was the fourth consecutive quarter in which Orocobre's received price has fallen sequentially by more than 9 per cent.\n\nThat trend looks set to continue, with Orocobre predicting its average sales price in the three months to December 31 would fall again to between $US6200 a tonne and $US6500 a tonne.\n\nOrocobre's received price was less than half the $US14,699 a tonne that Orocobre received in the September quarter of 2018.\n\nDespite the lower prices and bearish markets for lithium, Orocobre is one of the few ASX-listed lithium producers to be generating cash on a \"cash flow from operations\" basis at the moment.\n\nThe company's net cash balance declined slightly to $US151.2 million in the three months to September 30 based on ongoing investments in the second stage of its Olaroz lithium brine operation in Argentina.\n\nDespite generating cash during a very bad market, Orocobre remains the fourth most-shorted stock on the ASX with 15.8 per cent of the register sold short on October 15.\n\nBattery minerals producers continue to dominate the ranks of most-shorted stocks, with Western Australian lithium producer Galaxy the second most shorted and graphite miner Syrah Resources the most-shorted stock in Australia with more than 17 per cent of its register betting on further falls.", "description": "Rio Tinto wants to make treasure, in the form of lithium, from its borates mining trash, adding to the woes of incumbent producers such as Orocobre.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2265%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_67/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0c1488743b5180f7090aa974da2bce801bbc57aa", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
