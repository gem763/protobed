We need practical, realistic solutions on how the new customs controls in Northern Ireland should concretely be implemented,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAn agreement on an orderly departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union remains possible,\u201d she told lawmakers, adding to loud applause: \u201cI can say that we will not allow hate and violence to flare up on the island of Ireland again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will negotiate until the last second,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf necessary, we can meet again for an extraordinary (European) Council. But let\u2019s see what happens here. Even if we are well prepared for a disorderly exit, an orderly Brexit is of course in everyone\u2019s interests.\u201d", "description": "Solutions still need to be found for customs arrangements in Northern Ireland to clinch a Brexit deal and European Union leaders could yet meet again if they do not reach an agreement at this week's summit, Germany's Angela Merkel said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441803489&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0LG", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
