The trial being launched by Sainsbury's will effectively remove 10 tonnes of plastic from more than one million bouquets (file photo)\n\nIt is the latest evidence of how supermarkets and other retailers are making big strides to remove plastic packaging and make greater use of recycled materials.\n\nFor example, Sainsbury's and Waitrose are looking at selling products, everything from pasta to laundry liquid and fresh produce, loose in refillable cartons and bottles rather than throwaway plastic packaging.\n\nThe 12-week trial, which will involve a switch to paper wrapping, marks another step towards achieving the company's commitment to reduce plastics by 50 per cent by 2025 (stock)\n\nOther key measures include doing away with black plastic trays and trays made from PVC and polystyrene, which are difficult to recycle.\n\nThe initiatives are a vindication of the Daily Mail's efforts to highlight the dangers of plastic waste dating back more than ten years, including the Banish the Bags and Turn the Tide on Plastic campaigns.\n\nDirector of Sainsbury's Brand, Judith Batchelar, said: 'We are proud to be the first retailer to reduce fresh floral plastics on a significant scale, across 167 of our stores.\n\n'Our customers have made it clear that they want us to reduce plastic packaging - developing a more sustainable solution to minimise plastic on fresh flowers is a further step in the right direction.\n\n'This initiative is very much a testing and learning activity for us, so we will be seeking feedback from customers as well as getting a better understanding of how our supply chain manages the new packaging throughout.\n\n'This latest trial supports our broader goal of reducing, reusing, replacing and recycling more plastic.'", "description": "The trial being launched by the UK supermarket will effectively remove 10 tonnes of plastic from more than one million bouquets, the firm claims.", "authors": ["Sean Poulter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/08/18905628-0-image-a-13_1569395120443.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
