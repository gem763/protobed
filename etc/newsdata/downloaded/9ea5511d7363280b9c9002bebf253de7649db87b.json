Statesman Journal)\n\nA study that tested 168 baby foods from 61 brands found that 95% of baby foods tested are contaminated with one or more toxic heavy metals, according to a report released Thursday by the Healthy Babies Bright Futures organization.\n\nThe heavy toxic metals found in the baby food include lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. According to a news release, these toxins can affect the growth of a baby's brain, lower IQ and increase the chance of cancer as well as lifelong deficits in intelligence.\n\n\"Arsenic, lead and other heavy metals are known causes of neurodevelopmental harm,\" said Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician at Boston College.\n\n\u201cLow-level exposures add up, and exposures in early life are especially dangerous. The cumulative impact of exposures is what makes this a significant concern that demands action,\u201d he said.\n\nYuck!
