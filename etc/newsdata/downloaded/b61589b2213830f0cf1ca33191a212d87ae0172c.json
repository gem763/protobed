(AP) - The Atlanta Falcons have a new backup plan if punter Matt Bosher hasn\u2019t recovered from a groin injury by Sunday\u2019s game at Indianapolis.\n\nMatt Wile worked on punts and kickoffs on Wednesday, one day after he was signed to the practice squad. Wile was Minnesota\u2019s punter in 2018 , and he spent time with the Falcons in 2016. He was cut by the Vikings in the preseason.\n\n\u201cHaving experience not only here but elsewhere was a big piece of it,\u201d said Falcons coach Dan Quinn of the decision to sign Wile following punter auditions.\n\nBosher also normally handles kickoffs and is the holder on field goals and extra points.\n\nThe Falcons were forced to consider dramatic last-minute adjustments after Bosher strained his groin during warmups before last week\u2019s win over Philadelphia . Kicker Matt Bryant had to handle kickoffs, a duty he hasn\u2019t regularly held in a decade. Bosher punted despite being obviously limited by the injury.\n\nThe Falcons even had wide receiver Mohamed Sanu practice kickoffs in pregame warmups.\n\nHow close was Sanu to kicking off?\n\n\u201cPretty close,\u201d Sanu said.\n\n\u201cIt would have been cool. It would have been fun. It would have been like Pop Warner again. That\u2019s the last time I kicked off.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the sort of pregame drama a coach enjoys.\n\nQuinn remained optimistic that Bosher could be active against the Colts. He said he\u2019ll give Bosher the full week to recover.\n\n\u201cWe definitely have confidence in Bosh as the punter but we\u2019ll see what it looks like at the end of the week,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI have confidence. I would never bet against Bosher in any way.\u201d\n\nBosher has missed only one game in nine seasons in Atlanta. His career average of 45.7 yards per punt is a franchise record.\n\nThe Falcons would have to have full confidence in Bosher to avoid a repeat of the field-advantage setbacks caused by the makeshift kicking plan last week. The longest of Bosher\u2019s three punts carried only 42 yards, and none of Bryant\u2019s kickoffs reached the end zone.\n\nBosher attended Wednesday\u2019s practice, but did not participate while Wile handled the punts in the sessions open to reporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just training and preparing like I\u2019m going to play, but I don\u2019t know exactly what is going to happen,\u201d Wile said.\n\nWile has experience kicking off and holding on extra points and field goals. He said he \u201cfelt pretty good hitting\u201d kickoffs on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Atlanta Falcons have a new backup plan if punter Matt Bosher hasn't recovered from a groin injury by Sunday's game at Indianapolis.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles Odum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/falcons_bosher_injury_football_17345_c0-191-4576-2859_s1770x1032.jpg?8d6e0cec42d679bb750942e50e57d25d154054d6", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
