Making this change would allow us to save money and put it toward electing Republicans up and down the ballot next November.\u201d\n\nSuch moves are sure to infuriate Trump\u2019s long-shot party challengers, who say the local parties are trying to tip the race toward the president.\n\n\u201cTrump and his allies and the Republican National Committee are doing whatever they can do to eliminate primaries in certain states and make it very difficult for primary challengers to get on the ballot in a number of states,\u201d former Rep. Joe Walsh, who recently launched his campaign, told Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, the RNC should be ashamed of itself, and I think it does show that Trump is afraid of a serious primary challenge because he knows his support is very soft.\u201d\n\n2020 DEMS CUT FROM HOUSTON DEBATE RIP DNC FOR 'LACK OF TRANSPARENCY,' VOW TO PRESS ON\n\nRNC officials told Politico that it had nothing to do with the state decisions.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, by turns arrogant and paranoid, has made no secret of the fact that he wishes to be crowned as president rather than elected. That might be fine in a monarchy, but we overthrew ours two centuries ago,\u201d tweeted former Mass. Gov. and primary challenger Bill Weld.\n\nThe push reflects a broader debate around how states hold their contests running up to the general election.\n\nThere was never a move to scrap the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House. State law mandates that New Hampshire hold the first presidential primary every four years.\n\nBut three of Trump\u2019s top supporters in the Granite State made an initial push late last year for the state Republican Party to drop its decades-old neutrality clause in order to formally back the president in the primary against any challengers. Top GOP leaders in the state opposed the idea, and Republican Gov. Chris Sununu insisted that \u201cthe New Hampshire State Republican Committee must remain neutral in primaries.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe ringleaders of the proposal to have the state party formally endorse Trump dropped their bid.\n\nBecause of the libertarian streak among New Hampshire Republicans, and the ability of independents \u2013 who make up roughly 40 percent of the state\u2019s electorate \u2013 to vote in either the Republican or Democratic presidential primaries, the Granite State is considered the state where long-shot GOP candidates looking to challenge Trump for the party nod would try to make their stand.\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.", "description": "Four state Republican parties are looking to potentially scrap their primaries and caucuses for 2020, giving President Trump a clear run in those states, and poising yet another hurdle to his potential primary challengers.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/06/694940094001_6084123051001_6084121054001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
