He joins Biden, Sanders and Warren as the first qualifiers for the debate at the University of California-Los Angeles.\n\nGabbard also took another step toward qualifying for next month's fifth debate in Atlanta: She needs either to earn 5 percent in one more early-state poll, or two more polls, national or early-state, at at least 3 percent before qualification closes on Nov. 13.\n\nThe UNH poll was conducted Oct. 21-27, surveying 574 likely Democratic primary voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\n\nBiden has lost nine points since the previous UNH poll, conducted in July. In that survey, Biden had a slight advantage over Sanders and Warren, who were tied for second place with 19 percent each.\n\n\u201c[Biden\u2019s] campaign is just not very good, and I think the age issue has hurt him,\u201d said UNH professor Andy Smith, who conducted the poll. \u201cIf people think you\u2019re the most electable candidate, but people don\u2019t think you\u2019re electable, then what else do you have? What is Joe Biden other than the most electable candidate?\u201d\n\nBiden does have a sizable edge in electability, the poll shows. More than one-in-three primary voters, 36 percent, say he's the candidate with the best chance to defeat President Donald Trump, though that's down from 45 percent who said he was the strongest general election candidate in the July survey. Eighteen percent say Warren has the best chance of winning the general election, and 14 percent say Sanders does.\n\nBut Sanders leads on other important measures: He's the top choice of voters asked which candidate is most likable (27 percent), most \"progressive\" (47 percent), best able to handle health care (33 percent) and best able to handle the \"climate crisis\" (30 percent).\n\nThe New Hampshire primary is notoriously volatile and difficult to poll, and Smith, the UNH pollster, highlighted the uncertainty, pointing out that only 23 percent of likely primary voters say they have definitively picked a candidate.\n\n\u201cThe biggest takeaway is voters are nowhere near making up their mind,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere is a good chance [Biden] can recover from this. Nobody has locked this thing down.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6f/2a/586d779e4044a751dfe0ea8bf1c4/191029-bernie-sanders-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
