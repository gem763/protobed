Not only did it show drawings of areas needed fixed on someone's face, but it also created bruising on the face as if to imply someone already got plastic surgery.\n\nHappy: The announcement comes after some effects caused backlash because they altered people's faces. Users praised the decision on Twitter to remove the effects\n\nFull statement: Spark AR made its announcement on Facebook but did not explain what specific effects it would be removing\n\nOther user-generated effects like 'Plastica' and 'Bad Botox' were probably targeted in the company's recent decision.\n\n'We\u2019re unable to provide exact timing on the new policy rollout, but will share updates as soon as possible,' Spark AR wrote on its post.\n\nHundreds of effects are available on the app for people that are submitted by other users, so it remains unclear how Spark AR intends to police these effects.\n\nThis announcement comes after Instagram revealed last month how it will be cracking down on posts promoting weight-loss products \u2014 such as detox teas and shakes often advertised by celebrities like the Kardashians \u2014 and cosmetic surgery to users.\n\nInstagram revealed it would not allow for people under the age of 18 to view promotional posts for specific products.\n\nIt would also prevent accounts from making unfounded claims about a specific product, like stating they lost 10lbs. by drinking a detox tea when that is actually not the case.", "description": "Instagram has banned all that give the effect of plastic surgery in an attempt to promote the company's 'well-being policies'.", "authors": ["Danielle Zoellner For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/19/20096768-0-image-a-76_1571855082594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
