Photo: Netflix\n\nSpoilers below for El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.\n\nFor five minutes in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are together again, walking victoriously out of a hotel after a marathon meth-cooking session and then having breakfast at a diner, their infamous bullet-riddled RV parked outside.\n\nMinutes earlier in El Camino, viewers watch as Jesse, in true Heisenberg style, kills two villains and burns down their business with their corpses inside. That\u2019s when writer-director Vince Gilligan gives Breaking Bad viewers the gift they\u2019ve been waiting six years to see: a reunion between the meth mentor and mentee that takes place years earlier, right in the sweet spot of the Walter-Jesse journey.\n\nDesigned to fit within the second season\u2019s classic \u201c4 Days Out,\u201d which happens to be Aaron Paul\u2019s favorite episode of the series, the flashback sequence delivers on Breaking Bad\u2019s dark humor \u2014 \u201cI totally graduated high school, dick!\u201d \u2014 and pathos, as Gilligan skillfully reminds us who Walter White was before he got into the empire business. In that Breaking Bad episode, the duo gets stuck four days in the desert, cold and without food and water, because Jesse drained the RV\u2019s battery by mistake. After science saves the day, El Camino reveals exactly what happened next: They spend the night at a hotel and have breakfast at a diner before Jesse drops off Walt, who lied to his wife about visiting his mother, at the airport.\n\n\u201cI just wanted people to see Walt again because there is no Breaking Bad without Walter White,\u201d Gilligan said. \u201cI thought that I could show them in some moment from the past that was very dramatic and exciting. But then I thought, Hell, that\u2019s what the whole rest of this movie was about! How about we show a little quiet moment way back in the day when they weren\u2019t at each other\u2019s throats on such an existential level? Go back to when they annoyed each other, but basically they had respect for one another.\u201d\n\nTo pull off the secret filming of El Camino in New Mexico last year, production staff implemented code names, shielded locations, used disguises, and made up backstories for anyone curious about why some of Breaking Bad\u2019s familiar faces were in Albuquerque. The diner where Jesse and Walt have breakfast was populated with crew and family or friends of the crew. \u201cI remember watching it for the first time and seeing Brian Lax, our medic since the pilot, sitting at the counter having coffee. In the booth behind him are two of our producers and one of our producer\u2019s daughters,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt was so beautiful to see friends and family coming together to be part of a pretty iconic reunion.\u201d\n\nBut keeping Paul and Bryan Cranston from being discovered together was another matter. \u201cGoing from the car to set, both of us would have to wear these ridiculous looking cloaks, like we were part of a very, very, very demented cult,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI also thought it drew a lot more attention to us, but obviously it worked. It was so much fun. It was so nice to zip on skins of these characters that kicked off Breaking Bad. There was some blood already on their hands, but it was a much happier time. And working alongside Bryan once again in this world was something I never thought I was going to be able to do. It was a dream.\u201d\n\nThe flashback ends with Walt, who is coughing blood and fearing his cancer is worsening, telling Jesse he\u2019s very lucky. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait your whole life to do something special,\u201d Walt says pitifully, looking out the window. The moment, notes Paul, \u201cis heartbreaking and very telling of who Walt is.\u201d\n\nWalt struggling in the desert in \u201c4 Days Out\u201d. Photo: Netflix\n\n\u201cWalt has such grandiose ideas about himself as a human being,\u201d Gilligan adds. \u201cBut at the end of the day, he\u2019s such a pathetic character. In a way, that makes me sad for him too. This guy is so brilliant. He came close to winning a Nobel Prize. By this point in his life, he is more proud of cooking crystal meth than anything else because he\u2019s the best in the world at it. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s something as terrible as crystal meth. He knows, in his heart, he\u2019s the best in the world at it. And it\u2019s good to be the best in the world at something. Anything.\u201d\n\nTo film the first time Walt appears in El Camino, production rented out the top floor of a hotel so no one would accidentally spot Walt and Jesse swaggering down the hallway after cooking $1.3 million worth of meth, four days of hell in the desert, and a good night\u2019s sleep. \u201cWe had that long walk to give the audience what they wanted, this long reveal out of nowhere,\u201d Paul said. But after Gilligan yelled, \u201cCut!\u201d Paul got an idea he pulled out of his Breaking Bad prankster playbook.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to do another take, but I ran up to Bryan and I said we should do another take. I asked him, \u2018What are your thoughts on coming out in your tighty-whities and just walking down the hallway as a funny joke?\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd Bryan, of course, said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it! That\u2019s perfect.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs the tighty-whities \u201cwere flying to set in a van from a wardrobe truck,\u201d Paul, an executive producer on the movie, tried to buy some time. \u201cThey would say we need to move on and I would say, \u2018Let\u2019s do one more.\u2019 They would say, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s do it then,\u2019 and then I\u2019d have to say, \u2018Wait, we\u2019re discussing it.\u2019 But then it was just taking way too long and we were not able to get it on film. That\u2019s the type of stuff that we always did on the show \u2014 just funny, stupid, childish things. But in true Breaking Bad fashion, we gotta do it.\u201d", "description": "Aaron Paul and Vince Gilligan reveal how they pulled off Jesse Pinkman\u2019s and Walter White\u2019s flashback scene in El Camino without tipping off any diehard Breaking Bad fans.
