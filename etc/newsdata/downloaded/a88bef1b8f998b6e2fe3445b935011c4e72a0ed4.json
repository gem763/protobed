Col. Alexander Vindman testified to congressional investigators that among the omissions were Trump\u2019s assertions that there were recordings of former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry Army officer twice reported concerns about Trump's Ukraine tactics Ex-Trump official's refusal to testify escalates impeachment tensions MORE discussing Ukrainian corruption and a reference by Zelensky to Burisma Holdings, the energy company on whose board Biden\u2019s son sat.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVindman, a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, also testified that he sought to change the memorandum of the conversation to include the omissions. While he was successful in making certain edits, those two omissions were not corrected, The Times reported.\n\nWhile Vindman did not identify a motive behind the omissions, his testimony is likely to fuel further speculation and questions from House Democrats as to how the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky was handled.\n\nThe omissions do not alter the heart of the conversation, however, as the reconstructed transcript of the call shows Trump repeatedly pushing Zelensky to investigate Biden, a top political rival, on unfounded corruption allegations.\n\nVindman expressed alarm Tuesday about the conversation, saying he twice raised objections to his superiors about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman said in his testimony. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d\n\nThe testimony comes as House Democrats plan to expand their impeachment investigation into a new public phase.\n\nThe House is expected to vote Thursday to direct the House Intelligence Committee to conduct public hearings and compile a report to help the House Judiciary Committee as it mulls filing formal articles of impeachment.\n\nThe impeachment investigation into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine was launched last month, with Democrats alleging that the president may have tied $400 million in military aid to Kiev to its compliance with Trump\u2019s requests for an investigation into Biden.\n\nTrump has maintained there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine, but William Taylor, who serves as the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires for Ukraine, testified last week that the aid was directly linked to a commitment from Zelensky to open investigations into Biden and 2016 election meddling.", "description": "A White House official who testified in front of the House on Tuesday as part of its impeachment investigation reportedly said the White House\u2019s rough transcript of a July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelens", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/vindman4_102919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
