The Washington Post reports the \"startling display of acrobatics\" happened Oct. 19 in Silver Spring.\n\nAn officer with a K-9 tracked down Anderson. Police say he then \"jumped over an approximately 12-foot wall,\" but jumped back over when he encountered more officers on the other side.\n\nThe newspaper reports the world high-jump record is just over 8-feet (2.4-meters) so it's unlikely Anderson cleared the wall in a single bound. It's unclear how it was climbed.\n\nJail records didn't list an attorney who could comment on Anderson's behalf.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
