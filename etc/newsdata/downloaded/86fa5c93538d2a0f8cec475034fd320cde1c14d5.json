For your weekend reading, we've started in-case-you-missed-it compilations of some of the week's top USA TODAY Opinion pieces. As always, thanks for reading, and for your feedback.\n\n\u2014 USA TODAY Opinion editors\n\nBy Paul Brandus\n\n\"The Russians attacked us.If the commander in chief who swore to defend us said it didn\u2019t bother him, this is 'giving them aid and comfort.' The Russians are surely gearing up for more mayhem in 2020, and what does Trump care? Treason. ... Worse than Nixon? Worse in every way. And worse than all the rest.\"\n\nBurning down the house (Photo: Dave Whamond/Canada/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Tom Nichols\n\n\"The whistleblower\u2019s reward for observing proper procedure has been a chorus of orchestrated Republican talking points aimed at discrediting him and his motives. The message from the GOP is clear to this and any other whistleblower who might ever threaten a Republican president: Cross our Dear Leader, and we will destroy you.\"\n\nBy The Editorial Board\n\n\"There is no proof \u2014 despite claims by President Donald Trump and his defenders \u2014 that Joe Biden's son Hunter engaged in any legal wrongdoing while serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. ... (But) what was Hunter Biden thinking when he associated himself, and his family's good name, with business dealings in a country so steeped in corruption? And why didn't his dad ... more forcefully advise him against it?\"\n\nTrump's pitfall (Photo: Tom Janssen/The Netherlands/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Anita Y. Milanovich\n\n\"Courts shouldn\u2019t take on Congress\u2019 job and reinvent the meaning of 'sex.' Doing so would fundamentally redefine what it means to be a 'girl' or a 'woman' by judicial fiat and inject confusion, if not chaos, onto the track and the field, into the pool and the locker room. ... The entire premise behind sex-specific competition in sports is the simple scientific reality that, in general, males are stronger, faster and more physically powerful than females.\"\n\nBy Kurt Bardella\n\n\"This very decade opened with Republicans launching an investigatory barrage into the presidency of Barack Obama. I know, because I was there choreographing it. ... It was during this time that the standard for modern-day oversight was established, a standard that Republicans seemed all too willing to abandon the minute Donald Trump took office.\"\n\nAdam Zyglis/The Buffalo (New York) News/PolticalCartoons.com (Photo: Adam Zyglis)\n\nBy Britney Brinkman\n\n\"Many school districts have responded to the threat of mass shootings by increasing the number of police officers in schools \u2014 an understandable response propelled by the desire to increase safety. However, officers make schools more dangerous for black girls, not safer. For these students, normal behaviors are frequently criminalized, and the likelihood that they get caught in the school-to-confinement pipeline increases.\"\n\nBy The Editorial Board\n\n\"(Andrew) Yang is the only Democratic hopeful to support something called a \u201cuniversal basic income,\u201d or UBI. His plan would give $1,000 a month to all nonincarcerated, adult U.S. citizens. ... The UBI reflects the cynicism of today\u2019s politics. It proposes giving money to rich people to avoid the label of welfare. And it implicitly buys into the argument that government can\u2019t do anything right, so it shouldn\u2019t even try to decide how to allocate limited resources.\"\n\nBy Michael J. Stern\n\n\"The cards, as Trump has played them, leave him in a predicament. If he loses the 2020 election, he will be red meat for a Democratic president and attorney general eager to hold him accountable for his flagrant abuses of power. To avoid being fed to the Democrats, Trump\u2019s best bet is to follow the tried-and-true playbook that secured his 2016 win. This means illegally soliciting foreign assistance in the upcoming election.\"\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
