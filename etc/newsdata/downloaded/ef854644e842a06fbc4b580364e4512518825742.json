I am sure we have all done that.\"\n\nShe adds: \"Please take a moment to listen and talk to your child. The power of talk has a huge impact on our children's language development - it stimulates brain development.\n\n\"Their wisdom grows, their vocabulary becomes richer, and they develop curiosity, critical thinking and intelligence.\n\n\"In addition it supports a child to develop a good mental health.\"\n\nWendy shared the post alongside Mind charity's 'Take A Moment' poster and says improving mental health is a big priority at the school - for pupils, parents and staff.\n\n\"Over the last two years we've done a lot of work around trauma and mental health,\" she said.\n\n\"The children have yoga as part of their PE provision and we now offer parent yoga as well.\n\n\"We also do a lot of mindfulness in school and we're also taking part in Thursday's Hello Yellow day to raise funds for YoungMinds.\"\n\nSo far Wendy, who's been head at the 410-pupil school for seven years and has three older children herself, says the reaction has been mostly positive.\n\nShe told us: \"I know we don't always see what parents share but the feedback I have seen has been positive.\n\n\"There was one parent on her phone yesterday so I just said 'excuse me, we're now a mobile-free school and she just said 'oh right, sorry'.\"\n\nAs for how they might deal with any conflict, she added: \"Ultimately the school belongs to us, it's our rules, so we'll just ask them nicely and hope the message gets across.\n\n\"So much research has been done about how talking to people makes us feel so much better - and it's really sound research.\n\n\"Ultimately it's about the children and while they're in our care and our boundaries, that's what we're going to be asking for.\n\n\"It's very early doors so we'll just have to see but we have to at least try.\"", "description": "Wendy Cathie says the playground at St Peter's CE Primary School in Leigh, Greater Manchester, is becoming a 'mobile free zone'", "authors": ["Emma Gill"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20541400.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195421437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
