This suggests sales growth softened slightly over the last eight weeks despite stimulus from tax offsets and record low interest rates.\n\nInvestors are closely watching AGM trading updates for any signs the stimulus has helped boost sales and that the green shoots seen by several retailers in June and July have continued to grow.\n\nMr Spencer said same-store sales growth in the first quarter of 2020 followed unusual trading conditions in the year-ago period, when Babies R Us closed and Baby Bunting was forced to cut prices of high-end cots and prams in September 2018.\n\nOnline sales in the year to date have also been affected by technical issues associated with the transition to a new web platform.\n\nThe project was delay until early July and the platform experienced some technical and\n\nstability issues which significantly impacted online sales and customer experience in the first quarter.\n\nMr Spencer said traffic and average item value was growing, but conversion rates had fallen.\n\n\"Our focus is now shifting to improving and optimising the customer experience on the platform,\" he said.\n\n\"We have made further investments in our digital team to ensure that we are optimising the benefits of our investment in the new web platform. We expect these\n\ninitiatives will deliver incremental improvements in website performance which\n\nwill see sales growth momentum continue to build into the future.\"\n\nBaby Bunting's gross margin in the year to date was 36.6 per cent. up 270 basis points on the prior period, outperforming the company's expectations, boosted by growth in higher-margin private label and exclusive products and less clearance activity.\n\n\"We expect this level of performance to continue through the year,\" Mr Spencer said.", "description": "Baby Bunting still expects net profit to rise as much as 45 per cent this year even though sales growth appears to have been eased in recent weeks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a7b59e406017df6881c2b53f66bea6375a0b89d1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
