That didn\u2019t really stop hungry chicken sandwich cravers from patronizing the restaurant. But maybe this opinion piece in the Toronto Star will give them pause:\n\nChick-fil-A has released a poison into this city that tells queer people we\u2019re less welcome here. We\u2019re less safe. We\u2019re always surrounded by people who hate us, but now those people can show us how easily, they reach for their hate. #Opinionhttps://t.co/wthaSI95M3 \u2014 TorontoStar (@TorontoStar) September 12, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s how Andrew Wheeler kicks off his piece:\n\nThis past weekend I saw something that made me unexpectedly queasy; a young woman slurping soda out of a fast food cup. It upset me because it was a Chick-fil-A cup.\n\nIf there\u2019s a better introduction to an anti-Chick-fil-A screed out there, good luck finding it. Wheeler\u2019s triggering by a Chick-fil-A cup really sets the tone for the whole thing.\n\nWow, this piece is beyond insane. Comparing the Chick-fil-A signs to red hats. Saying we\u2019re only eating chicken spitefully. Saying Chick-fil-A is popular because of Trump\u2019s America. The stupidity just keeps going in this article. pic.twitter.com/E58FxOmtIk \u2014 The Dank Knight \ud83e\udd87 (@capeandcowell) September 18, 2019\n\nSomebody\u2019s spiteful, all right. But it\u2019s not Chick-fil-A fans. It\u2019s twerps like Andrew Wheeler who evidently have nothing better to do then try to manufacture outrage against a company that will serve straight and LGBT patrons alike \u2014 and do it with a smile.\n\nThis is an extraordinarily stupid take from someone who clearly suffers from a perpetual victim psychosis. It's a clean, welcoming, restaurant with polite, friendly, staff who serve extremely tasty food to customers\u2013including queer people. \u2014 #IAmtheNRA (@MrsDigger) September 18, 2019\n\nI'm so sorry for what the chicken sandwich did to you \u2014 Hey, guys (@jtLOL) September 18, 2019\n\nIf only you realized how small your problems are. \u2014 neontaster (@neontaster) September 18, 2019\n\nHow are these ppl even real \u2014 Bob Malak (@bob_malak) September 18, 2019\n\nHow far gays have come where their greatest nemesis is a chicken sandwich. \u2014 Dick Trickle (@atlharp) September 18, 2019\n\nIf you don't like @ChickfilA, fine. Don't eat there. But get the f**k out of the way of the rest of us that don't believe franchise owners should be punished because you're butthurt over a false narrative. https://t.co/DVUCjXMFgt \u2014 Hugh Manatee (@Wombat32) September 18, 2019\n\nIt's just a chicken sandwich, guys. https://t.co/2ZnTnAi9g7 \u2014 Nathan Wurtzel (@NathanWurtzel) September 18, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, let\u2019s see how that poison\u2019s been spreading in other cities:\n\nLet's check in with Chick-fil-A really quick . . . Aaaand yep, they're still out here saving lives \ud83d\udc14\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/wjNAiikaIu \u2014 Adam Ford (@Adam4d) September 17, 2019\n\nThose hateful bigots! And it gets worse:\n\nChemo 1 of 5 in the books. \u2705 The room was full of people there getting chemo alone. \ud83d\udc94 Then there was my cubicle \u2013 packed w 4 sisters & my momma \u2013 and an unreasonable amount of Starbucks & Chic Fil A.
