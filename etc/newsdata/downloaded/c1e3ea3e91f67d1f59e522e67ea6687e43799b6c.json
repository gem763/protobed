The company claimed Airtel now had the largest deployment of MIMO microwave on the planet.\n\nThe 1Gbps links currently use 28MHz of spectrum, and with the addition of another 28MHz, will hit 2Gbps.\n\nIndia is currently mulling whether to allow Huawei to be used in the nation's 5G rollout.\n\nSee: Will India allow Huawei to sell its 5G networking equipment in the country?\n\nLast week, Huawei founder and chief executive officer Ren Zhengfei said the company would be willing to licence all of its 5G technology to a US company.\n\n\"Source code, hardware, software, and the verification, production and manufacturing know-how, all of these are included in the package. And if they need it, we can also license the design of the chipsets,\" Ren said.\n\n\"After getting the licence, they should be able to compete with us around the world. It's not just confined to the US business.\"\n\nAt the start of the year, Ren pointed to Huawei's work on 5G and microwave technology as giving the company an advantage that might see bans lifted in the future.\n\n\"Huawei is the only company in the world that can integrate 5G base stations with the most advanced microwave technology. With that capability, our 5G base stations don't even need fibre connections,\" Ren said.\n\n\"Instead, they can use superfast microwave to support ultra-wide bandwidth backhauls. This is a compelling solution that makes a lot of economic sense. It works best for sparsely populated rural areas.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Huawei announced it had developed a fully containerised 5G core network.\n\nIn its first quarter earnings reported last month, Singtel Group saw its underlying net profit shrink by 22% to SG$575 million thanks to a SG$162 million exceptional loss by Airtel.\n\nThe loss by Airtel was related to provisioning for \"derivative liabilities relating to customary indemnities provided to a group of investors of Airtel Africa and expenses relating to its listing\", as well as depreciating 3G assets and spectrum refarming.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nHuawei unveils the Mate 30 series under a trade war cloud\n\nIf you can overlook the absence of Google's apps and services, Huawei's Mate 30 series has a lot to offer. It's a big ask though.\n\nHuawei eyes AI prowess, invests in compute power\n\nChinese tech giant unveils ambitious plans to build the architecture needed to meet growing demand for more compute power and artificial intelligence, pledging to do so on an \"open\" ecosystem\" and launching an AI training cluster that it says is 10 seconds faster that the current ResNet-50 record.\n\nHuawei urges Australia to embrace better Chinese products\n\nHuawei Australia chairman John Lord said Huawei is willing to allow the Australian government to test its products to make this happen.\n\nMore generic futurist hand-waving from Huawei's founder\n\nRen Zhengfei seems to be yet another blind optimist about technology's inevitable benefits, but with 'regional characteristics' and an odd vision for what a 'level playing field' for 5G looks like.\n\nInvestment in LTE still going strong despite the onslaught of 5G (TechRepublic)\n\nA report from a 5G trade association shows that 4G/LTE networks continue to grow despite the looming rollout of 5G.
