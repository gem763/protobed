Horowitz\u2019s team has questioned why the FBI considered Steele a credible source, and why the bureau seemed to use news reports to bolster Steele\u2019s credibility.\n\nPresident Donald Trump earlier this year gave Barr the authority to declassify documents related to his campaign surveillance.\n\nIn his letter, Graham detailed a wide range of documents he'd like to see, related to nine areas. Among them are documents shared with congressional leaders in 2018 about the Russia probe; the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants for Page or anyone else associated with the Trump campaign; a chart that shows the FBI\u2019s attempts to verify the allegations in the Steele dossier; and documents related to so-called defensive briefings given to the Trump and Clinton presidential campaigns in 2016.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI write to urge you to declassify all documents the Inspector General identifies as appropriate for declassification as much as possible, without harming national security,\u201d Graham said.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nHorowitz\u2019s office has said the probe is examining \u201cthe Department\u2019s and the FBI\u2019s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person.\u201d\n\nGraham's letter comes days after Horowitz\u2019s team released its report reprimanding former FBI director James Comey for drafting, leaking and retaining memos of his conversations with Trump. Last week, Graham suggested that the report is just the start of a series of looming rebukes for key law enforcement figures.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what I expect will be several more ugly and damning rebukes of senior DOJ and FBI officials regarding their actions and biases toward the Trump campaign of 2016,\u201d Graham said.", "description": "Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham on Tuesday formally asked Attorney General William Barr to declassify a huge cache of documents that could shed light on the FBI\u2019s use of surveillance warrants during its Russia and Trump investigations \u2013 saying it could help \u201cprovide a complete picture of what went on.\u201d", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is A Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/28/694940094001_6078145658001_6078160643001-vs.jpg"}
