The most famous example is Pluto, which was downgraded to a dwarf planet in 2006 after the IAU changed the requirements that defined a planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with Ceres and Pluto, there are three other known dwarf planets in the solar system \u2013 Haumea, Makemake and Eris.\n\nCeres and Hygiea hail from the asteroid belt, sharing the vast space with 7,000 other members, including a large asteroid called Vesta. It is believed that our solar system was formed around 4.5 billion years ago, when a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust collapsed and caused objects to smash against each other to form larger objects.\n\nThe gravity of newly-formed Jupiter is thought to have brought an end to the formation of planets in the asteroid belt region, instead causing small bodies to collide with one another and shatter them into smaller pieces.\n\nTo investigate how Hygiea got its spherical shape, the researchers peered through the VLT and analysed the data gathered using the telescope\u2019s SPHERE instrument. While high-resolution images showed Hygiea was rounded by its own gravity, the astronomers say they were \u2018surprised\u2019 it lacked large impact craters, ie, evidence of a major collision.\n\nPluto is the most famous dwarf planet (Reuters)\n\nThe team said they could only identify two small craters, neither of which \u2018could have been caused by the impact that originated the Hygiea family of asteroids\u2019.\n\nTo investigate further, the researchers used computer simulations, which showed a major head-on collision between two large bodies \u2013 possibly one of the largest impacts in the history of the asteroid belt thought to have occurred about two billion years ago.\n\nOnce the left-over pieces reassembled, they gave Hygiea its round shape and thousands of companion asteroids, the team said.\n\nStudy author Pierre Vernazza, from the Laboratoire d\u2019Astrophysique de Marseille in France, said: \u2018Thanks to these images, Hygiea may be reclassified as a dwarf planet, so far the smallest in the solar system.\u2019", "description": "'Hygiea' may be reclassified as a planet", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_92976572_1572255128.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
