Here\u2019s what you need to know about what impeachment is and how it works, starting with the basics.\n\nWhat does impeachment actually mean?\n\nIt means that Congress thinks the president is no longer fit to serve and should be removed from office. Here\u2019s what the Constitution says: \u201cThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nWho can impeach the president?\n\nCongress. Specifically the House of Representatives. Under the framework of the Constitution, the House can vote to impeach a president for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d It\u2019s up to them to decide what that means.\n\nBut impeaching the president is not the same thing as removing the president from office. For that, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the chief justice of the United States. Two presidents in American history have been impeached (Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). One resigned under threat of impeachment (Richard Nixon). None have been actually removed from office.\n\nWhat is an impeachment inquiry?\n\nIt\u2019s the first step in the impeachment process. It means lawmakers will investigate what, if any, \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d Trump may have committed.\n\nWhat is the process for an impeachment inquiry?\n\nPelosi said Tuesday that the six key committees that are already investigating the president will continue to investigate Trump \u201cunder that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.\u201d If the investigations conclude there are reasons for impeachment, the Judiciary Committee will draw up articles of impeachment, and the Judiciary Committee and then the full House will vote on it.\n\nHere\u2019s how Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) summed up the process in August to CNN, when he decided his committee was launching an impeachment inquiry: \u201cWe are investigating all the evidence, gathering the evidence. And we will [at the] conclusion of this \u2014 hopefully by the end of the year \u2014 vote to vote articles of impeachment to the House floor. Or we won\u2019t. That\u2019s a decision that we\u2019ll have to make. But that\u2019s exactly the process we\u2019re in right now.\u201d\n\nSo the House was already in an impeachment inquiry?\n\nYes. Well, kind of. It depends on whom you ask. Nadler\u2019s committee has charge over impeachment, and he surprised some of his members this summer when he publicly said they\u2019ve started an inquiry. Pelosi was not supportive of this, and as recently as last week wouldn\u2019t say \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d publicly. But the allegations facing Trump on Ukraine changed her mind.\n\nHow many Democrats support an impeachment inquiry?\n\nAccording to a Washington Post count, 196 House Democrats do, which is more than two-thirds of all House Democrats. That number has been growing steadily since April, when special counsel Robert S. Mueller III released his report on Russian election interference and Trump. That has been despite Pelosi\u2019s efforts to tamp down on impeachment, because she feared it could cost vulnerable House Democrats their seats and maybe even cost the party the White House.\n\nSince Congress came back from recess in September, the number of House Democrats who support an inquiry has ticked up by the week, sometimes by the day, and now, with the allegations Trump pressured Ukraine to help his reelection, by the hour. In the day before and on the day of Pelosi\u2019s embrace of it Tuesday, 57 House Democrats on the fence came out in support of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nHow long does the impeachment process take?\n\nIt can be as long or as short as the House wants. As The Fix\u2019s Aaron Blake notes, if past is precedent, this could be wrapped up in four months. But Democrats probably are on a tight timeline here; politically it could be much more difficult to make their case that impeachment is necessary if it\u2019s 2020 and nearing an election where Trump could get thrown out of office anyway. Before the Ukraine allegations, polls showed a majority of Americans didn\u2019t support impeachment.\n\nWill the Senate remove Trump from office?\n\nAs it stands now, probably not. There\u2019s no evidence the Republican-controlled Senate wants to confront Trump in such a way. In fact, on Monday Senate Republicans were trying to defend Trump. It\u2019s up to House Democrats to uncover something that could change Republicans\u2019 minds.\n\nAnother fascinating point on this: If the House impeaches Trump, it\u2019s possible Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) could just refuse to hold a trial. For centuries, the agreed-upon reading of the Constitution is that if the House impeaches a president, the Senate holds a trial to convict or acquit the president. But there could be some wiggle room for McConnell to avoid that spectacle, writes Bob Bauer, who served as White House counsel under Barack Obama.\n\nCould Trump run in 2020 even if he\u2019s impeached?\n\nIf he\u2019s impeached by the House, yes. If he\u2019s removed from office, well, that\u2019s never happened before so we\u2019d probably all be armchair-interpreting the Constitution to figure that one out.\n\nJM Rieger contributed to this analysis.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump.
