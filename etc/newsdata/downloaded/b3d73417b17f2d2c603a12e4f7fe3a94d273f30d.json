(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nAfter news broke that a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was at the center of an explosive whistleblower complaint, Trump was largely undaunted.\n\nBut many of his senior advisers weren\u2019t nearly as confident, and an internal debate roiled the White House.\n\nThe notes from his call with the Ukrainian leader showed the conversation was not as \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201ctotally appropriate\u201d as Trump had declared, and they warned him that sharing it might not be exculpatory. Two of his top Cabinet secretaries argued against disclosure, saying it would set a dangerous precedent to share details of a private phone conversation between two world leaders.\n\nYet on Wednesday morning \u2014 seven days after The Washington Post first reported the nature of the concerns raised by a whistleblower in the U.S. intelligence community and a day after House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry into the president \u2014 the White House released a rough transcript of the call, part of a broad gamble by Trump that he could once again beat the \u00adforces arrayed against him.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t see anything wrong with the conversation he had with a foreign leader,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), an ally of the president, referring to the call in which Trump offered his Ukrainian counterpart help from the Justice Department in investigating former vice president Joe Biden, a political rival.\n\nThe helter-skelter way the administration handled the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint could be a harbinger of the coming impeachment fight, with the White House scrambling to respond to a mercurial and frustrated president, who is increasingly sidelining his aides and making decisions based on gut instinct.\n\nEven some allies of the president worry that his team may not fully understand the potential upheaval that an impeachment fight could wreak on Trump and his administration, especially as he heads into the 2020 election.\n\nChristopher Ruddy, a friend of Trump and chief executive of the conservative Newsmax website, said the president\u2019s advisers appear to be underestimating the political dangers of impeachment proceedings. He argued that Trump could win reelection on the strength of his economic record and his rollbacks of regulations, but that an impeachment investigation could be a distraction.\n\n\u201cEven if people don\u2019t feel removing Trump is justified, they may feel there\u2019s too much disequilibrium, too much controversy, and it\u2019s better to have somebody more predictable,\u201d Ruddy said. \u201cSwing voters may like Trump\u2019s reformist agenda, but they don\u2019t like controversy.\u201d\n\nThose in Trump\u2019s orbit who say impeachment could help the president\u2019s 2020 bid are mistaken, he added.\n\n\u201cAre they nuts?\u201d Ruddy asked. \u201cPeople can\u2019t underestimate the amount of bad advice he gets from people who are not strategic thinkers.\u201d\n\nThis portrait of Trump grappling with a whistleblower complaint and facing down an impeachment inquiry is the result of interviews with more than two dozen current and former White House officials, lawmakers, Republican operatives, and Trump allies, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to share candid conversations.\n\nHeading into the weekend, White House aides were divided over how to handle calls for him to release the transcript of his call with Zelensky and the full whistleblower complaint.\n\nOver days of discussions, Justice Department officials \u2014 including Attorney General William P. Barr \u2014 and some of the president\u2019s lawyers urged him to release notes from the call before he traveled to New York on Sunday to attend the United Nations General Assembly this week. But others, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, vociferously argued against it, and Trump delayed a decision.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House was also receiving private pressure from Republican lawmakers, who said that the administration\u2019s position \u2014 which allowed rumor and worst-case speculation to fester \u2014 was untenable and that Trump had to release something to move past the controversy.\n\nTrump spent much of his time in New York worried about the issue, said aides, who described something of a split screen: the hubbub of world-leader confabs mixed with domestic political strife, and of mundane policy meetings infused with pitched rhetoric. Officials back in Washington found themselves largely out of the loop and struggling to catch up.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, Trump finally reached a decision to release the rough notes of his call the following day, and he shared the news that afternoon on Twitter, claiming that scrutiny over the \u201cvery friendly\u201d call was \u201cnothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that the administration doesn\u2019t comment on internal matters, but that \u201cit has been quite clear that President Trump \u2014 who is the ultimate decision-maker \u2014 has called for transparency throughout this entire process.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, aides invited roughly a dozen Republican lawmakers to the White House to preview and discuss the transcript before it was released to the public. At one point, Trump called in from New York, and attendees described him as generally in a good mood \u2014 \u201cchagrined\u201d but not angry, though skittish about some of the details.\n\nAt one point, the group began joking with the president that \u201cthis was one of his better\u201d phone calls with foreign leaders, an attendee said. And even privately, Trump did not believe his conversation with the Ukrainian president was problematic, according to four people with whom he spoke.\n\n\u201cHe feels it\u2019s going to help him on balance. Rather than have it out there week after week, saying he is demanding a quid pro quo, he just gets it out here,\u201d said Rep. Peter T. King, a New York Republican and Trump friend. \u201cThere are a number of Republicans in the House who are definitely anti-Trump who came up to me today and said, this shows nothing. They weren\u2019t like defending him. They don\u2019t really like him. They just say, \u2018Is this the best they have?\u2019 \u201d\n\nYet the frenetic messaging emanating from the White House further underscored the internal divides and undercut the administration\u2019s official nothing-to-see-here posture. Mnuchin and Pompeo, for instance, appeared on the Sunday shows to say it was not appropriate to share private conversations between world leaders, only to have their arguments undermined in real time by the president, who began confirming details of the call and hinting that he would soon share the rough transcript.\n\nThe White House also accidentally blasted out all their Wednesday talking points to Democratic congressional offices \u2014 including to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u2014 and then sent a follow-up message trying to \u201crecall\u201d their mistake. The talking points included attacking Democrats in Congress for \u201cdamaging our national security for political gain.\u201d\n\nAnd during his news conference Wednesday in New York, Trump pulled Vice President Pence into the controversy with him, urging the assembled reporters to also \u201cask for VP Pence\u2019s conversations because he had a couple of conversations also.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were perfect,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe House\u2019s decision to move forward on impeachment adds a new wrinkle for Trump. Throughout former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation, Trump allies and Republicans generally believed that the Democrats\u2019 threats of impeachment were politically beneficial to the president \u2014 who almost seemed to be daring his opponents to launch an official inquiry.\n\nBut Trump never actually expected \u2014 or wanted \u2014 to be impeached, said two allies, who both added that the White House, as currently staffed, is not prepared for this type of all-encompassing battle.\n\nNonetheless, many in Trump\u2019s world say an impeachment fight will benefit the president politically. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, predicted impeachment proceedings would backfire on House Democrats just as they did on House Republicans when he led the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and was accused of overreach.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have been sucked into a cul-de-sac where they will, from Trump\u2019s perspective, run around chanting, \u2018Impeach!\u2019 \u201d Gingrich said. \u201cI think that the president is very comfortable. It irritates [him], but he\u2019s very comfortable strategically with what\u2019s evolving.\u201d\n\nSome White House aides and outside confidants, however, worried that impeachment will also consume the remainder of Trump\u2019s term. His trade deal with Canada and Mexico, for instance, is likely to be among the casualties, they said.\n\nAnd as with the Mueller investigation, there is the risk that Trump\u2019s frustration over impeachment \u2014 which he views as an attack on the legitimacy of his presidency \u2014 will come to so enrage him that it prompts him to begin lashing out and behaving erratically. In the words of one former aide, \u201cIt may lead to less structured output from the White House.\u201d\n\nIn an effort spearheaded by Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s team is also trying to refocus the discussion on Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Giuliani has urged Republicans to forcefully attack the Bidens, although some White House staffers have been exasperated by Giuliani\u2019s combative television appearances.\n\n\u201cYou all are going to have to write about this,\u201d Giuliani told The Post in an interview Saturday.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the country\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nMeanwhile, morale inside the White House is low, current and former officials said. There is a growing sense that this new controversy will echo the Mueller probe, consuming all of the White House\u2019s bandwidth for the coming months and dashing hopes of pushing through even Trump\u2019s modest legislative agenda.\n\nWith the president already acting as his own adviser, it was difficult to attract new talent to join the White House, several current and former senior administration officials said. And now, there is concern that some staffers may leave, eager to avoid the morass of impeachment proceedings.\n\nAlready, Republicans are finding themselves in uncomfortable situations. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), one of the Republicans who journeyed to the White House on Wednesday morning to receive a preview of the rough transcript, surprised even some of his own colleagues by proclaiming at a subsequent news conference, \u201cNo one has read this transcript.\u201d\n\nA spokesman later said he was referring to Pelosi opening an impeachment hearing before seeing the readout of the Ukraine call.\n\nThe challenges for Trump will continue in the days ahead. A senior White House official said Wednesday that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was likely to be released Thursday or Friday to the public.\n\nRachael Bade, Devlin Barrett, Alice Crites and Paul Kane contributed to this report.", "description": "After a White House scramble and disagreement over releasing the rough transcript of a call with Ukraine\u2019s leader and the complaint it prompted, President Trump went against the advice of some aides and advisers and gambled that he could overcome the forces and possible evidence arrayed against him.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Wtzr0l6I7oofPIw7cCmDxY-Kl7U=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RX6FPZG77II6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
