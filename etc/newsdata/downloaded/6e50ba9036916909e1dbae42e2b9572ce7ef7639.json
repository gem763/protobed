They claim Biden, during his tenure as vice president, withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to compel the country\u2019s firing of a top prosecutor in order to protect his son, Hunter Biden. While it\u2019s true that Biden, following a foreign policy position of the Obama administration, urged Ukrainian leaders to oust the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, there\u2019s no evidence that he did it to help his son.\n\nDespite the facts, the Times still disseminated this conspiracy theory, Bedingfield said.\n\nShe pointed specifically to a widely criticized article published in the paper on May 1 that said in its headline that Biden was facing \u201cconflict of interest questions\u201d regarding Ukraine that were \u201cbeing promoted by Trump and allies.\u201d\n\nThe story, written by reporter Ken Vogel and freelance writer Iuliia Mendel, described how Biden had appealed to Ukrainian leaders for Shokin\u2019s ouster and how his son Hunter Biden had a \u201cstake in the outcome\u201d as he was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had been in Shokin\u2019s \u201csights.\u201d\n\nVogel\u2019s and Mendel\u2019s story included a line stating that \u201cno evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing\u201d for Shokin\u2019s dismissal. However, as The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple pointed out at the time, that caveat comes 19 paragraphs into the story.\n\n\u201cIn those first 19 paragraphs is a knot of details bound to be mangled by cable-news hosts and pundits in the coming months,\u201d Wemple, the Post\u2019s media critic, wrote in a column.\n\nIn her letter to Baquet, Bedingfield pointed out that the Times\u2019 reporting had promptly been challenged by Bloomberg News, which said the investigation into Burisma had been \u201cdormant\u201d at the time Biden was discussing Shokin\u2019s future with Ukrainian leaders.\n\nBedingfield also noted that Mendel, one of the co-authors of the Times story, joined the Ukrainian government as a spokesperson for the president of Ukraine just weeks after the article was published.\n\nConservative author Peter Schweizer gets top billing in the New York Times today! pic.twitter.com/dqcNamHKuc \u2014 Sal Rizzo (@rizzoTK) October 9, 2019\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign also took issue with an op-ed critical of the Bidens published in the Times on Wednesday by author Peter Schweizer, who was lambasted by Bedingfield as a \u201cdiscredited, right-wing polemicist.\u201d\n\nSchweizer \u201chas been one of the top people pushing the claim that Biden abused his office,\u201d Darcy wrote in CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources newsletter, adding that Schweizer \u2015 a senior contributor at right-wing site Breitbart \u2015 previously pushed the debunked conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton benefiting from a \u201cpay-for-play\u201d scheme involving uranium reserves.\n\nGovernment Accountability Institute President @PeterSchweizer revealed the Joe and Hunter Biden corruption scandals in Ukraine and China over a year and a half ago. The Establishment Media is finally catching up--and blocking and tackling for the Bidens. https://t.co/HIg2vxW4Vb \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) September 30, 2019", "description": "The Times was criticized for prioritizing \"sensationalism\" over \u201ctruth\" in its spread of a \"baseless conspiracy theory\" about Biden and Ukraine.", "authors": ["Dominique Mosbergen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EuW0dkcWkApfZ4WQyE68qg--~B/aD0zMDg0O3c9NDYyNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9ecd3621000042073436da.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
