He immediately corrected that call and called last tackle, and called last tackle four more times before the play actually broke down,' Mr Annesley said.\n\n'It's very disappointing that the game has been marred in controversy after that initial six again call, but ultimately I believe the decision not to give six more tackles was correct.\n\n'Had they not corrected that decision, I'd probably be standing here talking to you now about the fact that a try may have been scored in the next set off an incorrect decision where the six tackles shouldn't have been awarded.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nReferee Ben Cummins (in yellow) had his hand up signalling six more tackles before the Roosters end up with the ball\n\nThe refereeing blunder by Cummins (pictured with arm raised) occurred at a crucial moment that ultimately cost the Raiders\n\nMr Annesley said the incident was one of the reasons the NRL uses 'multiple officials', in a bid to get decisions right.\n\n'If we'd had one referee tonight we would have got the decision wrong,' he said.\n\nBut Mr Annesley did accept the decision 'created confusion among the Canberra players'.\n\nIt was one of several controversial decisions that went against the Raiders in their first Grand Final appearance in 25 years.\n\nIn the opening stages, a charged down kick which could have led to a Canberra Raiders try hit the Sydney Roosters physio on the field at the time, in the head.\n\nThe Raiders were also denied a penalty try when Josh Papalii was tackled without the ball metres from the try-line, which resulted in the sin-binning of retiring Roosters star Cooper Cronk.\n\nThe Roosters survived a second half onslaught from the Raiders to claim back to back premierships in a match marred with drama and controversy.\n\nFans and former players erupted with outrage after the full-time siren over the blunder that gave the Roosters victory.\n\n'Signalling six again & then changing their mind is the biggest referring blunder in grand final history... Absolute disgrace,' former Cronulla Sharks and Penrith Panthers star Martin Lang tweeted.\n\nShattered Canberra Raiders were out on their feet after giving it their all in one of the most controversial grand finals\n\nRoosters players celebrate after James Tedesco scored what ended up being the match-winning try with seven minutes to go\n\nJosh Papalii reacts after being brought down by Cooper Cronk without the ball which almost resulted in a penalty try\n\nThe Sydney Roosters rule the roost once again after claiming back to back NRL premierships in a controversial grand final\n\nTIMELINE OF CONTROVERSIES 3rd minute: Charged down kick which could have led to a Canberra Raiders try hit a Sydney Roosters trainer on the field in the head. 6th minute: The Sydney Roosters draw first blood when hooker Sam Verrills scores the first game of the match 49th minute: Josh Papalii denied a penalty try when he was tackled without the ball.

I don't want to take the spotlight off that.\n\nStuart was also tight-lipped over the incident involving the Roosters physio in the opening stages.\n\n'It ricocheted off their trainer and we lose the advantage.
