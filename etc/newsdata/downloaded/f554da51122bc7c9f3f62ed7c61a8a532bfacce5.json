Individual Americans could join it, even those covered by employer plans.\n\nButtigieg calls it \u201cMedicare for all who want it.\u201d\n\nThe South Bend mayor\u2019s plan tracks with former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s health care proposal. Biden would also provide subsidies for those who pick his \u201cpublic option.\u201d\n\nSpecifics are still missing on who would get financial assistance, and how much that would be. But Buttigieg and Biden have said they want to provide help to a broader cross section of Americans than are currently helped by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n___\n\nJULIAN CASTRO, former U.S. housing secretary: \u201cOhio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Nope.\n\nFigures from the Labor Department show that the former Housing and Urban Development secretary is wrong.\n\nOhio added jobs in August. So did Michigan . Same with Pennsylvania .\n\nSo Castro\u2019s statement is off.\n\nHowever, these states still have economic struggles. Pennsylvania has lost factory jobs since the end of 2018. So has Michigan . And Ohio has shed 100 factory jobs so far this year.\n\n__\n\nWARREN: \u201cMueller had shown to a fare-thee-well that this president obstructed justice.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s not exactly what special counsel Robert Mueller showed.\n\nIt\u2019s true that prosecutors examined more than 10 episodes for evidence of obstruction of justice, and that they did illustrate efforts by President Donald Trump to stymie the Russia investigation or take control of it.\n\nBut ultimately, Mueller did not reach a conclusion as to whether the president obstructed justice or broke any other law. He cited Justice Department policy against the indictment of a sitting president, and said that since he could not bring charges against Trump, it was unfair to accuse him of a crime. There was no definitive finding that he obstructed justice.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Cal Woodward, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Josh Boak, Eric Tucker and Amanda Seitz contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactChecketu\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Twelve Democrats seeking the presidency tussled Tuesday night in a wide-ranging debate featuring the largest number of qualifying", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/f5ea35_election-2020-debate-30579-joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-democratic-presidential-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
