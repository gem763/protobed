It raises new questions about the president\u2019s handling of sensitive information and may further strain his relationship with U.S. spy agencies. One former official said the communication was a phone call.\n\n[Gap continues to widen between Trump and intelligence community on key issues]\n\nThe White House declined to comment late Wednesday night. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and a lawyer representing the whistleblower declined to comment.\n\nIntelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson determined that the complaint was credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of \u201curgent concern,\u201d a legal threshold that requires notification of congressional oversight committees.\n\nBut acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to share details about Trump\u2019s alleged transgression with lawmakers, touching off a legal and political dispute that has spilled into public view and prompted speculation that the spy chief is improperly protecting the president.\n\nThe dispute is expected to escalate Thursday when Atkinson is scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee in a classified session closed to the public. The hearing is the latest move by committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to compel U.S. intelligence officials to disclose the full details of the whistleblower complaint to Congress. Maguire has agreed to testify before the panel next week, according to a statement by Schiff. He declined to comment for this article.\n\nThe inspector general \u201cdetermined that this complaint is both credible and urgent,\u201d Schiff said in the statement released Wednesday evening. \u201cThe committee places the highest importance on the protection of whistleblowers and their complaints to Congress.\u201d\n\nThe complaint was filed with Atkinson\u2019s office on Aug. 12, a date on which Trump was at his golf resort in New Jersey. White House records indicate that Trump had had conversations or interactions with at least five foreign leaders in the preceding five weeks.\n\n[Listen on Post Reports: National security reporter Shane Harris on the secret whistleblower complaint that concerns a \u2018promise\u2019 allegedly made by Trump to a foreign leader.]\n\nAmong them was a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin that the White House initiated on July 31. Trump also received at least two letters from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during the summer, describing them as \u201cbeautiful\u201d messages. In June, Trump said publicly that he was opposed to certain CIA spying operations against North Korea. Referring to a Wall Street Journal report that the agency had recruited Kim\u2019s half brother, Trump said, \u201cI would tell him that would not happen under my auspices.\u201d\n\nTrump met with other foreign leaders at the White House in July, including the prime minister of Pakistan, the prime minister of the Netherlands and the emir of Qatar.\n\nTrump\u2019s handling of classified information has been a source of concern to U.S. intelligence officials since the outset of his presidency. In May 2017, Trump revealed classified information about espionage operations in Syria to senior Russian officials in the Oval Office, disclosures that prompted a scramble among White House officials to contain the potential damage.\n\nStatements and letters exchanged between the offices of the DNI and the House Intelligence Committee in recent days have pointed at the White House without directly implicating the president.\n\nSchiff has said he was told that the complaint concerned \u201cconduct by someone outside of the Intelligence Community.\u201d Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, noted in a letter sent to congressional leaders on Tuesday that the activity at the root of the complaint \u201cinvolves confidential and potentially privileged communications.\u201d\n\nThe dispute has put Maguire, thrust into the DNI job in an acting capacity with the resignation of Daniel Coats last month, at the center of a politically perilous conflict with constitutional implications.\n\nSchiff has demanded full disclosure of the whistleblower complaint. Maguire has defended his refusal by asserting that the subject of the complaint is beyond his jurisdiction.\n\nDefenders of Maguire disputed that he is subverting legal requirements to protect Trump, saying that he is trapped in a legitimate legal predicament and that he has made his displeasure clear to officials at the Justice Department and White House.\n\nAfter fielding the complaint on Aug. 12, Atkinson submitted it to Maguire two weeks later. By law, Maguire is required to transmit such complaints to Congress within seven days. But in this case, he refrained from doing so after turning for legal guidance to officials at the Justice Department.\n\nIn a sign of Atkinson\u2019s discomfort with this situation, the inspector general informed the House and Senate intelligence committees of the existence of the whistleblower complaint \u2014 without revealing its substance \u2014 in early September.\n\nSchiff responded with almost immediate indignation, firing off a letter demanding a copy of the complaint and warning that he was prepared to subpoena senior U.S. intelligence officials. The DNI has asserted that lawyers determined there was no notification requirement because the whistleblower complaint did not constitute an urgent concern that was \u201cwithin the responsibility and authority\u201d of Maguire\u2019s office.\n\nLegal experts said there are scenarios in which a president\u2019s communications with a foreign leader could rise to the level of an \u201curgent concern\u201d for the intelligence community, but they also noted that the president has broad authority to decide unilaterally when to classify or declassify information.\n\nRevealing how the United States obtained sensitive information could \u201ccompromise intelligence means and methods and potentially the lives of sources,\u201d said Joel Brenner, former inspector general for the National Security Agency.\n\nIt was unclear whether the whistleblower witnessed Trump\u2019s communication with the foreign leader or learned of it through other means. Summaries of such conversations are often distributed among White House staff, although the administration imposed new limits on this practice after Trump\u2019s disclosures to Russian officials were revealed.\n\nCarol D.
