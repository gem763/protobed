The water might overflow while heating - this is OK but use a larger container if you wish to avoid.\n\nRepeat the two minutes on high and stir again; depending on your microwave the pasta may need one more two-minute trip to finish cooking. Between the pasta absorbing the water and it overflowing the mug you shouldn't have more than a few drops left in the mug.\n\nStir in a quarter cup of milk and a half cup of shredded cheese and stir thoroughly. You've achieved a tastier, less-processed microwave mac and cheese that is also cheaper than the packaged cups.\n\nDid you know you can also make chocolate cake and breakfast in a coffee mug?\n\nInstant Mug o' Mac & Cheese in the Microwave [Babble via 366 Days of Pinterest]", "description": "You can buy microwaveable macaroni and cheese packs if you're a fan of powdered cheese filled with all kinds of preservatives.
