Of the bunch, over 200 tests were atmospheric \u2013 meaning they were carried out in the atmosphere, with the bombs dropped from airplanes, detonated on barges or islands, or buried at a shallow depth to create a surface-breaking crater. The first atmospheric test took place on July 16, 1945 in New Mexico, on what was then the Alamogordo Bombing Range, according to a report from the US Department of Energy. And, between June 1946 and November 1962, both atmospheric and underground tests were conducted in the Marshall Islands, Christmas Island, Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, and over the South Atlantic Ocean. On March 1, 1954, scientists conducted a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll. Code-named Castle Bravo, the size of the event expectations, leading to radioactive fallout. This travelled to the nearby inhabited atolls of Rongelap and Utrik, and led to the evacuation of 253 people from the two islands for medical care. While some returned to Utrik just a few months later, the inhabitants of Rongelap did not return until 1957, and they later chose to leave again. The catastrophic test prompted many to call for the ban of atmospheric testing. After 1962, all nuclear tests in the US were conducted underground, many of which took place at the Nevada Test Site.\n\nThe researchers, led by M\u00e9lanie Baroni, said this indicated that ice in that area was continuing to release radioactive chlorine-36 into the environment around it.\n\nAlthough there are natural sources of the gas, they do not produce this much. The huge quantities produced by the nuclear tests of the 1950s were created when neutrons from the bombs reacted with chlorine already found in sea water.\n\nMs Baroni said: 'There is no more nuclear chlorine-36 in the global atmosphere. That is\u2026 why we should observe natural chlorine-36 levels everywhere.'\n\nThe chlorine-36 found in Antarctica got there because the gas became airborne after the bomb tests and was carried across the world by the wind.\n\nAntarctica is so untouched that the radioactive gas has remained there ever since.\n\nDespite levels of the gas being unusually high they are not great enough to pose a threat, Ms Baroni's team said.\n\nBut they were interesting to study because other types of radioactivity had already returned to pre-bomb levels, while this had stayed high.\n\nThe research was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres.", "description": "Researchers from a geosciences institute in France tracked levels of radioactive chlorine-36 over decades and found it hasn't decreased much in one particular area - Vostok.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/17/16137818-0-The_Marshall_Islands_were_hit_with_67_nuclear_bombs_as_part_of_U-a-50_1571415171994.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
