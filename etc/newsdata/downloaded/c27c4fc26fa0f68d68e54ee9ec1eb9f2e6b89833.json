Eurozone diplomats and European Commission (EC) officials reportedly confirmed to Politico that the coalition is encouraging EU governments to consider banning Libra altogether.\n\nThe European Commission cannot ban Libra without a legal reason\n\nHowever, a complete ban of Libra could be problematic for the Commission, the officials reportedly said. According to Politico, such an action would require Brussels to provide a legal reason to ban the initiative as well as more details on what rules should be applied.\n\nMoreover, EC officials have also called for more caution against rigorous measures in relation to Libra, raising concerns about its negative impact on the development of new technology-driven products and services in the European Union.\n\nPer Politico, the officials are working on a statement that will come out in December, in which they claim that Libra should not be allowed to launch unless the EU can regulate it. France, Germany and Italy had already suggested the idea of banning Libra back at the G7 meeting in mid-October after finance ministers discussed the risks associated with stablecoins, the report notes.\n\nOn Oct. 22, ING CEO Ralph Hamers argued that banks could stop providing services to Facebook if the firm launches Libra. Previously, the United Kingdom\u2019s central bank revealed a set of rules that Libra must comply with in order to be issued in the country.", "description": "Five European Union member countries are purportedly creating a unified front against the issuance of Facebook\u2019s proposed Libra stablecoin", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8yNjkyNTAwMDBjNmM3OTEzNjlhOTM2YjU4ZmVlNTExNy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
