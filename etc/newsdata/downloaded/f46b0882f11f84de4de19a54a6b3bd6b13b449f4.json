It was disgusting'.\n\nThe youngster (pictured above asleep on a hospital bed) didn't get ill until returning home from the holiday\n\nAllie (pictured above) was moved to the Manchester Royal Infirmary and put in an induced coma on August 1\n\nBut Allie did not start getting ill until five days after getting back to their home in Atherton, Greater Manchester, when she began suffering with stomach cramps, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and lethargy.\n\nPeppa Pig fan Allie was seen by an out-of-hours GP, but as she got worse she was admitted to Royal Bolton Hospital on July 30 where various tests were carried out.\n\nAllie (above) died on August 3 and her mother has now vowed to share her story\n\nIt was confirmed that Allie had contracted Shiga-Toxin producing E.Coli (STEC), which later led to her developing deadly Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) - a life-threatening complication related to the poisoning.\n\nHUS is a serious and potentially fatal condition that affects the blood and blood vessels, resulting in the destruction of blood platelets. It can also cause kidney failure and brain damage.\n\nAllie was moved to the Manchester Royal Infirmary and put in an induced coma on August 1.\n\nAn MRI scan was carried out, which revealed that she had sustained severe brain trauma and damage. Katie had to make the difficult decision to terminate Allie's life support following the advice from doctors.\n\nAllie died on August 3.\n\nKatie said: 'In sharing Allie's story, we want to make people more aware of the signs and symptoms of STEC HUS.\n\n'I keep thinking that if I had known about the condition, then I would have probably taken Allie to hospital sooner and it wouldn't have ended the way it did.\n\n'Allie was such a beautiful, happy girl and we are all utterly heartbroken. We still can't believe she is gone.\n\n'Allie was an intelligent, beautiful and independent little lady. She was always giving kisses and cuddles at home, and always wanted to be sat on someone's knee or to be picked up and carried around.'\n\nShe also said her daughter loved baking and playing with her dolls, she said she liked playing nurse and would stick plasters on the dog.\n\n'I bought her a nurse's outfit and doctor's bag full of equipment for her birthday but she never got to see them.\n\n'Allie also loved watching Peppa Pig and singing nursery rhymes.\n\n'There is now a massive hole in our home and our hearts. We all miss her dearly. She should not have died. She had so much to give.\n\n'While nothing will bring her back, we need to know what caused her illness and if anything could have been done to prevent it.\n\n'We all suffered gastric illness and there were a number of people complaining of being unwell during our stay at the hotel, but we didn't anticipate how serious it could be.'\n\nThe family have now instructed specialist international serious injury lawyers, Irwin Mitchell, to investigate what happened.\n\nPublic Health England is also currently investigating the matter, and an inquest has been opened to examine the circumstances surrounding Allie's death.\n\nJatinder Paul, a Senior Associate Solicitor and specialist international serious injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing the family, said: 'Allie's family are understandably heartbroken at the loss of their lovely little girl and are struggling to come to terms with what happened.\n\n'Through our work we are sadly only too aware of the potentially devastating consequences of serious illnesses such as STEC and E.coli, particularly for children, which are only highlighted by Allie's sad death.\n\n'This is every parent's worst nightmare and we are supporting Katie and her family through this difficult time and are now investigating how Allie contracted her illness.\n\n'As part of our investigations, we are looking into the family's stay at the Crystal Sunset Luxury Resort and Spa and if any issues are identified, we hope that measures will be taken to ensure this does not happen again.'\n\nThe Crystal Sunset Luxury Resort and Spa has been contacted for comment.", "description": "Little Allie Birchall, from Atherton, Greater Manchester, was struck down by E.Coli poisoning  after staying at the Crystal Sunset Luxury Resort and Spa, east of the city of Antayla.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19443348-0-image-a-16_1570540087580.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
