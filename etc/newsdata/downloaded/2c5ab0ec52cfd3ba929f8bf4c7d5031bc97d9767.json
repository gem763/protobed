He spent over two decades as the Vatican\u2019s supreme law enforcement officer, a figure that veteran Vatican analyst John L. Allen likened to the J. Edgar Hoover of the Catholic Church.\n\nSuspicions of personal corruption followed allegations that Giani had embezzled funds totaling some $160,000 meant for the Vatican police for home improvements to his personal apartment.\n\nWhile rumors of Giani\u2019s impending ouster had already been circulating since last February, many Vatican watchers believed that he was untouchable because \u201che knew where all the bodies were buried,\u201d as one insider put it to Breitbart News.\n\nIn the eye of the hurricane is Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, currently the prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, who oversaw the offices of the Secretariat of State during the period under investigation.\n\nOne of the five Vatican staff caught up in the October 2 raid was Monsignor Mauro Carlino, a former secretary and longtime aide to Becciu who resides in the Vatican\u2019s Santa Marta residence.\n\nCardinal Becciu has been accused of obstructing investigations initiated by Cardinal George Pell into financial improprieties by Vatican officials. According to the Financial Times, Vatican investments in London properties made in 2014 and 2018 were authorized by Becciu, who was the second-ranking official in the Vatican\u2019s Secretariat of State at that time.\n\nIt was reportedly Becciu who blocked a proposed external audit of all Vatican departments in 2016, which was to be carried out by the accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCooper.\n\nBecciu was also responsible for the dismissal of the Vatican\u2019s first-ever auditor general, Libero Milone in 2017. Suspicions have been raised that both Pell\u2019s prosecution in Australia for alleged abuse, which resulted in his removal from his post as economic czar in the Vatican, and the firing of the auditor general, were driven at least in part by Becciu\u2019s efforts to cover his tracks and avoid an investigation into his dealings.\n\nAt the time, Milone declared that he had been dismissed on bogus charges after he unearthed evidence of financial misconduct under Becciu\u2019s direction, noting that his investigations and the reforming work of Pell\u2019s Prefecture for the Economy were perceived as a threat to the business practices of powerful Curial officials.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The Vatican announced the resignation of its head of security Monday in the midst of a growing scandal over massive real estate deals.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
