REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nSterling, which had enjoyed its biggest rising streak since October 1985 and hit a five-month high on the back of the Brexit deal, gave up ground on Friday morning amid doubts that the agreement would receive parliamentary approval. The pound eased 0.18% to buy $1.2865. GBP=\n\n\u201cWhatever was agreed last night with the EU still has to go through the British parliament ... The uncertainty surrounding that still hasn\u2019t changed one iota,\u201d said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut in Perth, Australia.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was up about 0.1% in early trade, echoing Wall Street\u2019s small gains. Australian shares were off 0.6%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei .N225 added 0.5%.\n\nEquity markets had enjoyed a bounce from the initial Brexit news, with the S&P 500 .SPX briefly topping 3,000 points for the first time in more than three weeks.\n\nInvestors were also encouraged by upbeat earnings from Netflix and Morgan Stanley, but poor results from International Business Machines Corp and weak U.S. economic data weighed.\n\nHousing starts, industrial production and mid-Atlantic factory output all fell short of economist expectations.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI gained 0.09% to 27,025.88, the S&P 500 .SPX finished up 0.28% at 2,997.97 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC rose 0.4% to 8,156.85.\n\nOn Friday morning, S&P 500 e-mini stock futures ESc1, were down a hair at 2,997.\n\nChina is also in focus in Asia with the world\u2019s second-largest economy expected to post its weakest economic growth in at least 27-1/2 years when it releases gross domestic product data at 0200 GMT. Weak numbers could raise pressure on Beijing to introduce new stimulus measures to counter the effects of a long-running trade war with the United States.\n\nMcGlew said expectations for a further slowdown in China had been largely priced in by the market already.\n\n\u201cUnless it\u2019s a diabolically low number, I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s going to have too much of an impact on prices today. But we can\u2019t price that uncertainty,\u201d he said, referring to further developments in the trade spat between Washington and Beijing.\n\nOn Thursday, China said that it hoped to reach a phased agreement in its trade dispute with the U.S. as soon as possible.\n\nReflecting the cautious mood, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell slightly to 1.7483% compared with a U.S. close of 1.755% on Thursday.\n\nIn the currency market, the dollar was flat against the yen at 108.65, while the euro EUR= was up 0.04% on the day at $1.1126.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was barely lower at 97.596.\n\nOil was mixed ahead of the China data, with U.S. crude CLc1 up 0.1% to $53.99 a barrel, but Brent crude LCOc1 easing by 0.13% to 59.83%.\n\nSpot gold XAU= was flat, trading at $1,491.73 per ounce.
