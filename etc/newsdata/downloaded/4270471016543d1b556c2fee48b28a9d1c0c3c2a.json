When we saw the model, we looked at each other and thought we can look forward to the future,\u201d Nancy Rivas said.\n\nAD\n\nJean and Christopher Mays are watching their house go up now and anticipate moving in next summer. They\u2019ve lived in Gaithersburg, Md., for decades. \u201cWe\u2019re really drawn to being in the country,\u201d Jean Mays said.\n\nAD\n\nScreened porch: The builder, Wormald Homes, offers the modern farmhouses in three floor plans: the single-level Crawford and the two-level Osborne and Taylor. All the floor plans have a two-car garage.\n\n\u201cWe were conscious of working in a bucolic country setting, and Frederick has a rich history of farming,\u201d said Ken Wormald, a managing partner and leader of the company\u2019s architectural design team. \u201cSo we thought, \u2018Let\u2019s do a fresh take on the modern farm trend.\u2019 We pushed the envelope on open-plan living. In the Taylor, we created a seamless threshold between the inside and outside.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe model home, with the Taylor floor plan, has an optional 12-by-20-foot screened porch, in the back, that is reached from the dining area through a three-panel sliding glass door. The three panels, instead of one or two, allow for a bigger opening, which can make the porch part of a continuous space with the inside of the house. A high-tech screen material renders the porch\u2019s screens almost invisible.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven when the weather is bad and the glass doors are shut, you\u2019ll feel close to the outdoors because the light comes through,\u201d said Lisa Stuart, Wormald sales manager.\n\nThe kitchen is next to the dining area. On one side of the kitchen and dining room is the great room, and an adjoining deck or patio is an option there. On the other side, the house has a \u201ckeeping room\u201d \u2014 traditionally a sitting room kept warm by the nearby kitchen \u2014 and a home office, or studio, surrounded by glass.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen people are working on their computer, they still want to see light, and when they want a private conversation they can close the door,\u201d Wormald said. The studio can be reconfigured as a bedroom suite.\n\nStairs to the second floor are in the entrance hallway at the front of the house.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, the model home has a media room occupying space that could become a playroom, a lounge or a children\u2019s homework room. A nearby laundry room has a washer and dryer, sink, cupboards and windows. All the bedrooms have walk-in closets. Two have private bathrooms, and two share a bathroom.\n\nAD\n\nThe builder added a hidden retreat, or man cave, on the lower level. \u201cPeople get a kick out of that,\u201d Wormald said. A recreation room comes standard, for a limited time, on the lower level, along with a large unfinished room.\n\nAD\n\nAmenities: The Landsdale community has a spacious clubhouse, eight-lane Olympic-size pool, a leisure pool, tennis courts, a sport court, trails, amphitheater, playground, tot lot and several small parks.\n\nNearby: Whiskey Creek Golf Club, Hope Valley Golf Course and Rattlewood Golf Course are all a short drive away. Holly Hills Country Club is open to members and guests. Area parks include Wildcat Forest, Great Seneca Stream Valley Park and the Upper and Lower Magruder Branch parks.\n\nShopping: Urbana has Giant Food, Whole Foods, Lowe\u2019s, Target, Staples and Talbots, as well as restaurants, cafes, bars, banks and various sporting goods, fashion, fitness, books and furniture businesses. The city of Frederick has many shops and restaurants downtown, and there are shopping malls and outlets nearby.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSchools: Green Valley Elementary, Windsor Knolls Middle, Urbana High.\n\nTransit: Monrovia is eight miles from Frederick, where commuters can board the MARC train to Washington (with stops at Rockville and Silver Spring for transfers to Metro.) Landsdale is near Interstate 70 and not far from I-270.\n\nLandsdale\n\n11070 Emerald Crown Dr., Monrovia, Md.\n\nWormald Homes is developing 30 single-family home sites.
