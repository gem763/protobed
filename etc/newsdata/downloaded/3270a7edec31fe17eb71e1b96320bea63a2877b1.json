With added supervision, he can spend up to three days in the city.\n\nThe Alberta Review Board has also decided de Grood, 28, will be able to travel within Alberta for up to a week, as long as the trip has been OK'd and he is with a responsible adult.\n\nIt also says de Grood could possibly take up residence in a 24-hour supervised group home in Edmonton.\n\nThe psychiatrist in charge of de Grood's medical treatment said the man's risk of reoffending is low.\n\nBut Dr. Santoch Rai also told the Alberta Review Board that if de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe.\n\nA judge in 2016 found de Grood not criminally responsible for the killings because he was suffering from schizophrenia at the time.\n\nA trial heard that de Grood, who was then 22, believed that the devil was talking to him and that a war was about to begin, signalling the end of the world, when he arrived at the Calgary party, which was being held to mark the end of the school year.\n\nFrom left: Zackariah Rathwell, Lawrence Hong, Kaitlin Perras, Jordan Segura and Joshua Hunter were stabbed to death April 15 while celebrating the end of post-secondary classes. (Photos from Facebook)\n\nHe killed Zackariah Rathwell, 21; Jordan Segura, 22; Kaitlin Perras, 23; Josh Hunter, 23; and Lawrence Hong, 27.\n\nThe victims' families had previously expressed their wishes for de Grood to be designated as \"high-risk\" NCR (not criminally responsible), which would mean he could go up to three years between hearings.\n\nGregg Perras, father of Kaitlin Perras, said he was not surprised by the review board's decision.\n\n\"We've been punched in the head almost every time by this process,\" Perras said. \"So, I was expecting them to do exactly what the treatment team said. It's mind boggling that he could have unsupervised access to the community this year.\"\n\nPreviously the families said the annual reviews of de Grood's treatment derailed their healing process. Perras said de Grood is hoping to take a week long vacation with his parents.\n\n\"If he was in the judicial process he would have [received] 125 years in jail.\"\n\nJosh Hunter's father, Barclay Hunter, also said it's hard to understand.\n\n\"It's hard for the average person to wrap their head around,\" Hunter said. \"Why this is acceptable and why this would happen \u2026 I think he needs to be treated fairly and humanely and treated for his illness. But you know our goal is to see that people that cross that threshold in severe cases like this are not ever considered for absolute discharge.\"", "description": "A review board has ruled that a mentally ill man found not criminally responsible after killing five young people in Calgary in 2014 can be eased back into the community.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2714494.1464216712!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/de-grood.jpg"}
