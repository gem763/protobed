They\u2019re deposing witnesses behind closed doors and denying Republicans fair time to ask questions and the right to call their own witnesses \u2014 and won\u2019t even release full interview transcripts,\u201d the editorial notes.\n\n\u201cInstead, they\u2019re leaking negative info and withholding favorable facts \u2014 feeding fanatically anti-Trump media to repeat slanted interpretations as fact. This is no constitutional effort to get at the full facts: It\u2019s a rush to sell the public on a narrative of presidential wrongdoing,\u201d it continues.\n\n\u201cThe White House is entirely right to call out [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi\u2019s game. And her only proper response is to treat her drive to impeach Trump the same way her Republican predecessors did their drive to impeach Clinton. Is she simply afraid to be fair?\u201d\n\nTHE HAPPY HILLARY PRESS\n\nThe news media is offering sprightly coverage to former first lady, senator, Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has reemerged on public radar with non-stop commentary against President Trump \u2014 including a brag that she could beat Mr. Trump in a White House rematch.\n\nThe press is giddy. A few headlines from the past 24 hours:\n\n\u201cDo it, Hillary\u201d (The Week); \u201cHillary Clinton is joking about running again in 2020, right?\u201d (CNN); \u201cHillary is the one that got away. But isn\u2019t going away\u201d (The Washington Post); \u201cWho should run against Trump? How about Hillary Clinton?\u201d (The San Francisco Chronicle); \u201cWill Trump persuade Hillary Clinton to run again?\u201d (The National Interest).\n\nABOUT THOSE \u2018ENDLESS WARS\u2019\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision to pull back the U.S. military in Syria may be a policy even most Democrats can agree with.\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to get out of these ridiculous endless wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. We will fight where it is to our benefit, and only fight to win,\u201d Mr. Trump said this week.\n\nA Rasmussen poll asked respondents whether they agreed with this statement. A majority did.\n\n\u201cFifty-eight percent of likely U.S. voters agree with Trump\u2019s statement; just 20% disagree, while 22% are not sure. Even 55% of Democrats agree with the statement, although it is important to note that Rasmussen Reports did not identify Trump as the source of the quotation,\u201d the pollster points out.\n\nAnother 69% Republicans and 50% of independents also agree. The survey of 1,000 likely U.S. voters was conducted Oct. 7-8.\n\nMEANWHILE IN MINNESOTA\n\nPresident Trump will be in Minneapolis on Thursday for a jumbo Keep America Great campaign rally with all the trimmings. Oh, but it\u2019s complicated. Lt. Larry Elder, spokesman for the Minneapolis police, says his force for the event has the help of the Hennepin County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the University of Minnesota police, Metro Transit police and the State Patrol, as well as local and federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nThere\u2019s tension afoot. Thousands of pro-impeachment protesters are expected to show up according to Minnesota Public Radio. In addition, local officials threatened the Trump campaign with a security bill topping $500,000, and the campaign, in turn, threatened to sue the city.\n\nUndaunted fans of Mr. Trump, however, have been assembling outside the venue since Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMore than 48 hours before the rally was scheduled to start, President Trump\u2019s supporters began lining up outside the arena. Among the first in line was Dan Nelson, an engineer from Spring Lake Park, Minn. hoping to get a front-row seat. He wants to show the president how much he appreciates Trump\u2019s tax and economic policies,\u201d MPR noted.\n\nHERITAGE FOUNDATION THROWS A PARTY\n\nA significant conservative organization is planning a very upbeat celebration in the nation\u2019s capital. The Heritage Foundation will host an inaugural black tie gala on Oct. 22 titled \u201cHeritage Honors,\u201d hosted by Kay Coles James, president of the group.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is the keynote speaker; the big night will feature \u201cmusical experiences that will bring you to your feet, real-life stories that showcase our American identity and culture, plus a special tribute to Heritage founder Edwin J.
