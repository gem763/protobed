Last 10 year Gold average return in India is 8%.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look into the journey in the International and Indian market.\n\nIn 2001, Gold was trading above $250 an ounce but after the global recession (2008) price accelerated and it touched $1900 ounce in 2011. From the last 6 years, gold was trading in a range below $1380 but the first time in the month of Aug-19 it break $1380 level.\n\nFirst time in India Gold touched Rs 39,000 in the month of Sep-19. One may question when the global price came down from $1900 level (2011) to $1500(2019) then why the gold price in India during the same period jumped from Rs 20,000 (2010) to Rs 39,000 (2019)?\n\nIt\u2019s not that demand for in India pushed price but weakness in Indian rupee made yellow metal costlier. Indian Rupee Jumped Rs 44 to Rs 74 from the last 10 years.\n\nWhat forced gold price to jump around 21% within 4 months & is the recent gold rally the real?\n\nGold was trading at $1150 one year back (Sep-18). In the last four months, the price rallied almost 21%. USA-China trade war is the main reason for the recent gold rally. The world looks gold often as a haven in times of turmoil or acts as a hedge against inflation.\n\nWhat is the link between trade war & Gold?\n\nThe trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies started in mid of 2018 and became intensified, stretched for almost a year which hampered global growth and pushed the economy into slow down. As consider safe-haven asset during global economy uncertainty & slowdown hence we saw a rally in gold from mid of 2018.\n\nDoes this trade-war uncertainty going to continue and is it worth buying on this Dhanetras?\n\nFinally, two superpowers have reached a basic agreement on parts of the trade disputes and reached a trade deal after 14 formal negotiation sessions, which have lasted over 15 months.\n\nAs the rally in is not demand-driven rather it's majorly due to global uncertainty. A recent development in trade-war going to help gold prices to come down from its high in upcoming days.\n\nWhereas India's imports in August plunged 73% from a year ago to the lowest level in three years. Lower imports by the world's second-biggest consumer could cap gains in global prices.\n\nWe may see price towards $1380 in the international market where in India market towards Rs 35,000 \u2013 Rs 33,000 level in the coming days.\n\nAs the market gets more clarity on the trade war and overall macro sentiment get improves money will start flowing from safe-haven asset like to riskier asset class like equities.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author (Author is a certified Research Analyst).", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Biswajit Behera covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures.
