Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported Q3 earnings of $2.32 per share, just above the top end of management guidance, and just ahead of the $2.26 expected by analysts.\n\nThe company met its full-year free cash flow target in the quarter of $4 billion, while management affirmed its commitment to return approximately $3 billion back to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, returning $468 million in Q3.\n\nThe company continues to grow its premium product ticket revenue, improving 9% year over year. Premium products and non-ticket sources now make up over half of Delta\u2019s revenue. Lower cargo revenue and third-party refinery sales were detractors.\n\nIn an announcement of a recent American Express contract renewal, CEO Ed Bastian stated, \u201cOur recent contract renewal provided diverse, high-margin revenue stream that we expect to grow to nearly $7 billion by 2023 with further growth through the end of the decade.\u201d\n\nSee also: Small Cap Exposure with Global X Russell 2000 Cover Call ETF\n\nMr. Bastian also highlighted the recent partnership with LATAM Airlines. He added, \u201cThe agreement adds geographic diversity in a fast-growing continent, adding 100 new destinations to our map and significantly improving our position in South America. Once approved, our proposed JV will move Delta from a current #4 position in South America to a combined #1 position. We expect this partnership to translate to $1 billion in new annual revenue over the next 5 years and improve returns in the Latin entity.\u201d\n\nThe company continues to grow and become a more efficient operator, but rising costs remain in focus. Delta hired staff to accommodate higher volume, gave raises to existing employees and incurred costs to its pension plan in the quarter.\n\nWe think the strategy Delta has in place to expand its reach and woo premium customers is working, although we will continue to remain watchful of any excess capacity growth. With recent pressure on shares due to cost concerns, the world\u2019s most valuable airline trades at 7.4 times next 12-month earnings expectations and yields 3.0%. Our target price for DAL is $78.\n\nMore From MoneyShow.com:", "description": "We continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects of our broadly diversified portfolios of what we believe to be undervalued stocks, notes value investor John Buckingham, money manager and editor of The Prudent Speculator.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
