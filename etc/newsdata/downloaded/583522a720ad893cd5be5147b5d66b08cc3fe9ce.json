Here\u2019s what that means.", "language": "en", "text": "The whistleblower reported that White House officials were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, concluding that \u201cthey had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d After that, the whistleblower claimed, White House officials sought to \u201clock down\u201d the details of that call.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow? Officials were \u201cdirected\u201d by White House lawyers to \u201cremove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored,\u201d and load it on to a \u201cseparate electronic system\u201d normally used for \u201cclassified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u201d\n\nAnd the whistleblower claimed this happened repeatedly.\n\nThis abuse of power is worse than it first appears, once you drill down into the details of how this likely worked and what it means.\n\nFor such an explanation, I spoke to Ned Price, a former senior director at the National Security Council, the president\u2019s advisory team on national security and foreign policy matters. An edited and condensed transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nAD\n\nPlum Line: The whistleblower describes a computer system in which transcripts \u2014 like this one of the call \u2014 are \u201ctypically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to cabinet level officials.\u201d Can you describe this system?\n\nAD\n\nPrice: That\u2019s an allusion to a system that National Security Council staffers use to conduct the vast majority of classified business \u2014 to communicate about classified matters. That system can accommodate material that is classified up to the level of Top Secret.\n\nWhat other types of things are stored on this system?\n\nIt\u2019s 99.9 percent of the classified business that the NSC does. Correspondence with the State Department. Correspondence with the intelligence community. Correspondence with others in the policy community. This is essentially the go-to computer system for nearly all classified business of the NSC staff.\n\nAD\n\nThe whistleblower complaint then says the transcript was loaded into a \u201cseparate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u201d Can you describe that system?\n\nAD\n\nAs described in the complaint, this is a system to which very few people on the NSC staff have access. These staffers form part of what is known as the NSC Directorate for Intelligence Programs. These are the very few career officials whose job is to oversee and safeguard the most sensitive information.\n\nThis system can retain information up to the classification level that\u2019s known as Top Secret//Codeword. That refers to a series of special compartments within the realm of Top Secret information.\n\nAD\n\nHow large a group in this directorate would have access to this?\n\nNo more than a handful. They are career officials from within the intelligence community who have, throughout their professional lives, dealt with extraordinarily sensitive information. They come from the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, among other departments and agencies.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike other career officials who may come from non-intelligence community components, they are specially trained to safeguard and protect Top Secret//Codeword information.\n\nWhat type of material is generally stored on this much more sensitive system?\n\nIt is supposed to be the most sensitive information within our government\u2019s possession. Notionally speaking, that could include covert action programs overseen by NSC staff but run by the CIA. It could include extraordinarily sensitive intelligence information that emanates from the most precious intelligence sources.\n\nAD\n\nThere is supposed to be a bare minimum of information on that system because it is so highly protected and segregated from other classified systems.\n\nIs it unusual to store something like this call transcript on there? The whistleblower says one White House official described this act as an \u201cabuse of this electronic system, because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe executive order that governs classified information specifically forbids classification in order to protect information that\u2019s embarrassing or otherwise politically sensitive. This is something Congress would want to look at.\n\nAD\n\nThis system is highly regulated and protected with the most rigorous safeguards available. The introduction of any materials that don\u2019t meet that very high threshold corrupts the integrity of that system. It\u2019s now going to be under tremendous scrutiny, including by Congress.\n\nThis has the potential to make information that should be on the system more vulnerable and expose it to additional eyeballs and to additional risk, which has the potential to do tremendous harm.\n\nAn appendix in the whistleblower complaint says, \u201caccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was not the first time under this administration that a presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system, solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIs placing anything in this system because of its political sensitivity itself an abuse of power? What does it mean that it may have happened multiple times?\n\nIt means officials leveraged infrastructure designed to protect our most sensitive secrets to protect the president himself.\n\nWhat recourse is there at this point?\n\nCongress needs to determine if these calls represented additional attempts by Trump to put his own personal and political interests ahead of the national interest. Congress must also scrutinize whether the preservation of records of those calls on this particular system points to an attempted coverup by those around the president.\n\nRead more:\n\nMichael Gerson: The impeachment wheel has begun to turn\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president\n\nHenry Olsen: The whistleblower complaint doesn\u2019t do Democrats any favors\n\nKaren Tumulty: Impeachment will define the 2020 election\n\nE.J.
