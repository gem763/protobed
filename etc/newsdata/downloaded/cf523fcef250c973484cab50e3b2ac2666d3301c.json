Elaine was played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus.\n\nIn 1995, the home, which is in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, was purchased by the current owners for $950,000, according to Realtor.com. \"Seinfeld\" began airing in 1989, and as the owners told The Wall Street Journal, many of the shots used for the show were taken before they moved in.\n\n\"They had to come back and do footage for the final episode of Seinfeld shortly after we moved in because they discovered in their archives they didn't have a night shot of our house,\" one of the owners, Lori Monson, told The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"Maybe twice a month, someone would walk by, and they'd say, 'Is this Elaine's house?' I would go, 'How would you know that?'\" Monson told the Journal. \"Maybe, I'd say, about 10 years ago, it stopped.\"\n\nThe 4,730-square-foot townhouse has six bedrooms and four full bathrooms.
