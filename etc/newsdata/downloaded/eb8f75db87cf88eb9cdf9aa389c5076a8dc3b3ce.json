He\u2019s an apprentice engineer who\u2019s currently off work in the process of moving house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough he can spend nights off without the booze, his tendency is more to binge on the nights that he is out with friends. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nMonday\n\nI took it easy as I was moving out of my parents and into a new house the following day.\n\nSpent the night not drinking and preparing stuff for the next day moving.\n\nUnits: 0\n\nTuesday\n\nSpent the full day moving all my stuff into my new house with my friend so we decided to have a celebratory night out.\n\nHad a half bottle (35cl) of vodka before I went out then possibly 20 vodka colas while out. Drinks at the club I normally go to are as low as \u00a31 each, so it\u2019d be rude not to.\n\nUnits: 30.5\n\nWednesday\n\nIncredibly rough from the night before and having things to do in the new place, so no drink was consumed, as even the thought would make me sick.\n\nUnits: 0\n\nThursday\n\nWent to the gym to try and feel somewhat healthy after Tuesday night\u2019s drinking, and feeling hungover on Wednesday. No drink consumed.\n\nUnits: 0\n\nFriday\n\nSat in the house watching a movie with my new housemate.\n\nHad two cans of Strongbow Dark Fruits, but didn\u2019t want to overdo it because I was going out the following day.\n\nUnits: 3.6\n\nSaturday\n\nOff out for a friend\u2019s birthday party, so pre-drank with four cans of Strongbow Dark Fruits before going out.\n\nAt a rough estimate I\u2019d say it was then around 10 vodka and cokes while at the pub/club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnits: 16.2\n\nSunday\n\nToo hungover from the night before so no drink was consumed.\n\nUnits: 0\n\nTotal units this week: 50.3\n\nTotal units in a week recommended by the NHS: 14 units (for anybody regardless of gender).\n\nSpill It is a weekly series out every Friday.
