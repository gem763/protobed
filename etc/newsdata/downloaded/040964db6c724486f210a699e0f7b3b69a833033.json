It definitely feels great to be back on pole but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the best track to start on pole,\u201d said Leclerc after lapping the Olympic Park circuit in one minute 31.628 seconds on the fastest soft-compound tyres.\n\n\u201cIt definitely feels very special but I don\u2019t really want to think about those stats for now, I just want to focus on the job,\u201d said the youngster when spoken of in the same breath as seven-times world champion Schumacher.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go tomorrow, we\u2019ve been competitive all weekend long and the race simulation seems positive too. It\u2019s looking good for tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHamilton had been third behind the two Ferraris after the first flying laps of the final shootout session but the man who has more career poles than any driver still lifted himself on to the front row with slower, medium tyres.\n\nHis time was 0.4 seconds off Leclerc\u2019s best but denied Ferrari a front-row sweep by 0.023 ahead of a race that has only ever been won by Mercedes since it first appeared on the calendar in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough qualifying session because these guys have some crazy speeds on the straights,\u201d said the five-times champion after ending up in a Ferrari sandwich.\n\n\u201cThey go to another level. You know that whole \u2018party mode\u2019 you talked about us having? They have something else beyond that \u2014 jet mode.\n\n\u201cNonetheless I gave it absolutely everything I had at the end. I\u2019m so glad it came together, I wasn\u2019t expecting it to.\u201d\n\nGRID PENALTIES\n\nMax Verstappen qualified fourth for Red Bull but the Dutch youngster carries a five-place grid penalty due to an engine change, meaning Hamilton\u2019s team mate and title rival Valtteri Bottas moves up to the second row.\n\nHamilton leads Bottas by 65 points with six races remaining and is well placed to extend his lead on Sunday, given that he is 96 points clear of closest non-Mercedes rivals Leclerc and Verstappen in the standings.\n\nVerstappen\u2019s Thai team mate Alexander Albon crashed out of the first phase of qualifying, smashing backwards into the barriers at turn 13 and bringing out the red flags, after Williams\u2019s Robert Kubica had also spun.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing really to say other than I went in a bit hot like Max did in FP3 (final practice) and I lost the rear. There\u2019s a tailwind in that corner and it just caught me out. When these cars go, they go quick,\u201d said Albon.\n\n\u201cIt was a silly mistake.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nMcLaren\u2019s Carlos Sainz will start fifth with Renault\u2019s Nico Hulkenberg sixth on a day when the Woking-based team announced it would be switching from the French manufacturer\u2019s engines to Mercedes from 2021.\n\nSainz\u2019s rookie team mate Lando Norris starts seventh with Haas\u2019s Romain Grosjean eighth and Renault\u2019s Australian Daniel Ricciardo joining former Red Bull team mate Verstappen on the fifth row.\n\nThe only Russian on the starting grid, Toro Rosso\u2019s Daniil Kvyat, will line up last due to engine penalties.", "description": "Charles Leclerc became the first Ferrari driver since Michael Schumacher to take four pole positions in a row on Saturday in a Russian Grand Prix qualifying session that bridged the generations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434898571&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0GX", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
