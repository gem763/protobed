And one can hope that your company has done well for its employees by picking low-fee, high-quality funds as options.\n\nYes, a good tax-advantaged retirement account is a fine thing. But if you work for a nonprofit, a government entity, or a school district, you probably don't get a good one. Your choice is called a 403(b), and if you think that's just a different name for the same basic product as a 401(k), you could be horribly, expensively mistaken.\n\nOn this Motley Fool Answers podcast, co-hosts Robert Brokamp and Alison Southwick have invited a couple of experts to explain just why 403(b) plans are the worst: Dan Otter and Scott Dauenhauer of 403bwise.org and the Teach and Retire Rich podcast. But first, there's a \"What's Up, Alison?\" segment in which Alison digs into the details and revelations that lead to WeWork's tumble from highly anticipated IPO to toxic hot mess.\n\nTo catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center.
