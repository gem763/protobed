Simply squiggles and lines? Or something a bit more x-rated?\n\nThere appear to be two camps on a recent Mumsnet thread, where one eagle-eyed poster shared their shock at the penises and vaginas on a Swatch watch design.\n\nThe design was spotted by one user\u2019s daughter, who promptly posted it in a conversation titled \u2018Would you wear it?\u2019\n\nIn the post, she said, \u2018Darling daughter \u2013 fortunately adult \u2013 was browsing the Swatch watches site and was looking at their pages of art where you can choose a section of a design or Old Master to have as the design on your watchstrap.\u2019\n\n\u2018Great idea. Not sure about this \u2018art\u2019 design though. Would you wear it?\u2019\n\nAlthough many people laughed at the pattern, which Swatch describe on their website as \u2018a cheeky project which provides fun through thumbnail sketches of handdrawn female and male privates\u2019, some didn\u2019t even see the privates whatsoever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne commenter claimed \u2018What am I missing? Can just see swirls and lines!\u2019\n\nThe watch inspired a lot of confusion (Picture: Swatch Watch)\n\nMany others said they had to zoom in before understanding the genital nature of the design, with first impressions seeming like everything from liquorice allsorts to a \u2018dotty pattern\u2019.\n\nThere was also the issue that some people were struggling with the anatomy of it all, as one person claimed \u2018I\u2019m worried, I don\u2019t even recognise some of the parts!\u2019 For posterity, there\u2019s anuses, penises, vaginas, and breasts, in all their pastel glory.\n\nThe conversation then turned to whether or not this pattern was \u2018suitable\u2019, with the general consensus being that cartoon penises really aren\u2019t anything to worry about from a child protection point of view; particularly when they\u2019re so indistinguishable from lines and dots.\n\nThe watch costs \u00a397, and is part of a collaboration between Swatch and the University of Art & Design in Lausanne.\n\nYou can change the design about when ordering, offering you the chance to favour any body parts you wish for your timepiece.\n\nWhether you\u2019d wear it though, that\u2019s the real question.\n\nMORE: What is retinol and how should you use it in your skincare routine?\n\nMORE: Couple wows the internet with their nude, pizza-filled engagement shoot\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Mumsnet users have spotted some very rude designs on this watch, but some people swear they can only see swirls and dots.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90600999_1571482717.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
