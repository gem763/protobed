Kumgang Tours", "language": "en", "text": "South Korea is still trying to think of ways of resuscitating tours to North Korea's scenic Mt. Kumgang resort by bypassing international sanctions.\n\nBut the idea is likely to be slapped down by the U.S., since it could undermine concerted pressure on North Korea, and even the cash-strapped North could refuse because it wants the sanctions lifted, not bypassed.\n\nThe Unification Ministry here has vowed to come up with \"creative solutions\" after North Korea asked Seoul last week to demolish \"all the unpleasant-looking facilities\" the South built in the resort.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in has admitted that it is impossible to revive the tours \"the way they used to be.\" Instead, a government source said, \"we've started thinking about ways to bypass sanctions against North Korea. The aim is to find a breakthrough in order to maintain inter-Korean relations.\"", "description": "Gov't Mulls Bypassing Sanctions to Revive Mt.
