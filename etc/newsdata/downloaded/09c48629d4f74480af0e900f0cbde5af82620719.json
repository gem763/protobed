It's an 'easy-going and fun' place, was the conclusion.\n\nAt the end of her visit she said that she didn\u2019t feel like she\u2019d spent much time really alone at all, 'because of how kind and inclusive everyone was'.\n\nThe establishment has been open for a year and the owner says he 'wants it to be a bar that offers customers a fun chance to meet new people'.", "description": "The bar, called Hitori, is in Tokyo's Shinjuku district, which is known for its vibrant nightlife.
