He and Giuliani encouraged President Zelensky to publicly announce an investigation into the Bidens. It has been alleged that there was a quid pro quo whereby Zelensky would be rewarded by the White House with a meeting between the presidents in return for launching an investigation into one of Trump's potential 2020 rivals.\n\n\u201cPlease know that I would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters. However, given the President\u2019s explicit direction, as well as the importance we attached to arranging a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, we agreed to do as President Trump directed,\u201d Sondland wrote.\n\n\u201cBased on the President\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President\u2019s concerns.\u201d\n\nMore to follow...", "description": "The U.S. ambassador to the EU will tell Congress that he was effectively forced to work with Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine by the President.", "authors": ["Jamie Ross", "Betsy Swan", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2471,w_4394,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571320881/RTS2RK92_nelvtc", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
