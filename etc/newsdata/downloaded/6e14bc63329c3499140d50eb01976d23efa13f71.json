Microsoft stock (ticker: MSFT) is up nearly 37% year to date, compared with a 16.5% gain for the S&P 500 and a 30% rise for the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK). The company is a favorite among analysts as it pushes into hardware, raises its dividend and scores well with environmentally and socially conscious investors.\n\nYet strong momentum in its cloud business has been one of the biggest highlights for Microsoft. The cloud operation has been one of the key contributors to its robust earnings.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. Microsoft will report results for its fiscal first quarter on Oct. 23. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes that it will be another strong quarter.\n\nHe predicts a \u201csolid beat across the board on both the top and bottom line as cloud strength on Azure and Office 365 continues to be the fuel in the tank,\u201d with \u201cstrong field checks indicating the company could beat commercial cloud expectations by approximately 3%+.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated an Outperform rating and $160 price target on the shares, arguing that it is still early innings for Azure\u2019s momentum. Microsoft was up 0.3% to $138.63 in afternoon trading.\n\nLooking ahead. Ives writes that the cloud business has positioned Microsoft well for 2020. The company \u201cis poised to win the lion's share of the next phase of cloud deployments vs. Amazon.com (AMZN) and [Jeff] Bezos,\u201d he says.\n\nHe anticipates that Azure\u2019s momentum will continue into 2021, helped by the long-term shift to the cloud and Microsoft\u2019s successful efforts to grab more of the enterprise pie from Amazon Web Services, the current leader.\n\nMicrosoft has endured recent volatility linked to the trade war relatively well, Ives says. More \u201cinvestors are starting to appreciate how leveraged Redmond is to the transformational cloud trend set to play out over the coming years in this \u2018cloud arms race,\u2019 along with [Microsoft\u2019s] unparalleled enterprise customer base,\u201d he writes.\n\nWrite to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com", "description": "Wedbush says market-share gains for Azure can help the stock to keep rallying.", "authors": ["Teresa Rivas"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-84729/social", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
