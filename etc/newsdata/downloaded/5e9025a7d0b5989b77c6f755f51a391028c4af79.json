She\u2019s been intimidated, beaten, and, most infamously, sentenced to two years in a harsh prison camp outside of Mordovia for \u201chooliganism\u201d\u2014this following the group\u2019s headline-grabbing \u201cPunk Prayer\u201d performance-art piece at Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow. And yet, the events of Sept. 7 managed to catch her by surprise.\n\nArmed with \u201cPussian\u201d Federation and rainbow flags, an array of colorful smoke cannons, and a banner reading \u201cPUTIN YOU\u2019D BETTER LEAVE BY YOURSELF,\u201d Tolokonnikova and her fellow Rioters aimed to protest the upcoming Moscow city parliament election outside the Russian White House. The anti-Putin women wanted to ensure a fair and just process\u2014a tall order given Putin\u2019s penchant for election meddling and fascistic crackdown on most forms of public dissent.\n\nThe moment they exited their residence, the 15 women\u2014including her 17-year-old sister Polina\u2014were \u201cimmediately, brutally arrested with no explanation why,\u201d according to Tolokonnikova, were thrown into a truck, had their phones confiscated, and transported to a Moscow police station where they were isolated in cells and grilled until 1 a.m..\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of our times,\u201d recalls Tolokonnikova. \u201cIt\u2019s true for us in Moscow right now\u2014more and more people are getting angrier. Being politically aware is a new norm. If you respect yourself, you go to rallies. If you respect your country, you\u2019re not afraid of the riot police because, in the end, the country is ours. We are the many and they are the few.\u201d Judging by the recent election results, wherein Russia\u2019s ruling party lost a third of their seats in parliament following mass protests, she appears to be right.\n\nJust before the arrest, I spoke with Tolokonnikova about the Russian police state, Trump\u2019s cozy relationship with Putin, and much more.\n\nTell me a little bit about Pussy Riot\u2019s new song, \u201c1937.\u201d What inspired it?\n\nThe idea for this song was inspired by the actions on the football field during the World Cup, when my colleagues ran onto the football field and they protested against the situation with political prisoners and persecution of political opponents of the Kremlin. Putin was seeing that action, so the cops were really mad. When they were arrested, one of the cops told them, \u201cIt\u2019s so sad that it\u2019s not 1937 right now.\u201d It is a really popular position, unfortunately, among people from the so-called Siloviky group, which has gained a lot of power under Putin\u2019s regime, and is comprised of FSB and cops. They don\u2019t want us to have a voice and be able to protest against them. They want to return to the time of 1937-1938, where around 700,000 people were executed because of standing orders. This song is written from the perspective of those tortured by police, and they\u2019re warning that at some point, the system will turn back against you.\n\nHow confident are you that the Russian people\u2014and this system that he\u2019s constantly manipulating\u2014will eventually turn against Putin?\n\nHaving examples like Muammar Gaddafi, I\u2019m pretty confident that the system will be turned against Putin. Do you remember how Gaddafi died? I\u2019m not saying that it should happen, or that I want it to be this way, but when you\u2019ve been a dictator for a long time, you\u2019re oppressing people and breaking their lives, and they\u2019re not happy about it. At one point or another your power will go away, and you will not be respected anymore. That\u2019s something that Putin realizes\u2014he\u2019s in power to protect himself, and his regime. But you can\u2019t just have power; you need another reason to believe in you. And Putin\u2019s time is running out for people to support him.\n\nYou must have been encouraged by the recent Moscow election protests, which brought some 70,000 people to the streets.\n\nOur strategy, for those anti-Putin, is to support anyone who\u2019s not in the ruling party\u2014since the ruling party is the most corrupt thing ever.\n\nI\u2019m curious what your life is like in Moscow. Are you in constant danger, and do you feel like you\u2019re regularly being followed?\n\nThe nature of oppression in Russia is not total. Not everybody is in prison, and you never know when you\u2019ll end up in prison. It\u2019s pretty random, actually, so you never know when it may happen. My mindset is just not to think about it. If you go out to rallies, protest, and make yourself heard, there is danger, and you should be ready to be arrested and go to prison. But you never can be ready for this bullshit. Police will beat you and then they\u2019ll accuse the protesters of beating police\u2014without any evidence but a police report, which cannot be trusted. So yes, the danger is very real.\n\nWhy do you think Putin and Trump are so drawn to one another?\n\nPutin wants to be a leader of a nativist, conservative, racist, short-minded world, and he\u2019s gaining international popularity all around the globe. Putin definitely wanted Trump to be elected. Putin is trying to be the world policeman as an alternative to the Americans as world policemen. It all started in 2004, and Putin was very scared that the Ukraine would become democratic, which would serve as an example to Russia. And then he was supporting Marine Le Pen [of France\u2019s far-right National Rally party] because of her conservatism, and he was giving money via Russian banks to support her. Seeing all these conservative movements connected to Putin, I\u2019m not surprised that he\u2019s supporting Donald Trump. That\u2019s obvious.\n\nBoth Trump and Putin enjoy undermining the press\u2014and dissent in general.\n\nTrump is not very much about the rule of law, and like Putin, he wants to put his political opponents in prison. He\u2019s said he wants to put Hillary Clinton in prison. And like Putin, he\u2019s not a fan of the free press. I think he\u2019d love to have as much power as Putin has, but the nature of the American political system is thankfully quite different, and there are some checks and balances.\n\nDo you believe Putin meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Tuump?\n\nIf you ask me if Russia meddled, I don\u2019t know for sure, but it\u2019s likely that they tried, because that is the nature of who Putin is. He\u2019s a KGB agent, and he\u2019ll always be a KGB agent. It\u2019s very dangerous to have a KGB agent as the head of your country, because you can be sure that he\u2019ll try to meddle in other countries\u2019 political decisions. He certainly helped Trump get elected.\n\nI know you came out and voiced your support for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Are you still Feeling the Bern for 2020?\n\nI\u2019m one of those who believes that Bernie Sanders could have won in 2016, and from what I know about the coming election in America, it looks more promising to me. After the terrible defeat that happened in 2016, Democrats changed their agenda to become much more progressive, and to be more in line with the minds of people\u2014because the people are progressive. I\u2019m trying to stay positive but am really curious what\u2019s going to happen. I have not made my decision yet. I\u2019ll let you know later who I endorse in this election. But I really love Bernie.", "description": "Pussy Riot\u2019s Nadya Tolokonnikova\u2014who was thrown into a penal colony by Putin for \u201chooliganism\u201d\u2014opens up about the Putin-Trump affair, Bernie Sanders 2020, and much more.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569722104/190911-stern-pussy-riot-tease_umc3ob", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
