Is this \u201cwell-connected Republican\u201d Rick Wilson or Mike Murphy or some other ardently and relentlessly anti-Trump Republican consultant?\n\nIt\u2019s not \u2026 \u201cPierre Delecto,\u201d is it?\n\nMy dude, there wouldn\u2019t be a 20 percent chance of the Senate GOP removing Trump from office even if he did shoot someone on Fifth Avenue on broad daylight. Without incontrovertible evidence that Trump withheld Ukraine\u2019s military aid until he saw movement on the Biden/Burisma probe, I\u2019d say there\u2019s less than a one-percent chance of removal. Even if that evidence emerged, with Gordon Sondland or whoever testifying that Trump framed the quid pro quo for them in those exact terms, I\u2019d guess there\u2019d be at most a 10 percent chance of removal. Most Republicans would retreat into the safe haven of \u201cbad but not impeachable\u201d logic.\n\nI think there may be a 20 percent chance of Democrats getting 51 senators to vote for removal, though. They\u2019d need either four or five Republican votes (depending upon whether Joe Manchin sticks with his caucus) for a \u201cmoral victory\u201d in which Trump remains in office but Dems get to boast that a clear majority of both chambers of Congress believes he ought to be driven from office right now. Just tell me who those four or five Republicans are. Romney, Murkowski \u2014 who else? Let\u2019s say someone like Richard Burr climbs aboard, creating a 50/50 split. Who\u2019s going to be the fourth Republican to gift-wrap a \u201cmajority voted for removal!\u201d talking point for the Dems ahead of the election with both Trump and McConnell breathing down his or her neck not to do so?\n\nWhy accept the political heat of casting the 51st vote knowing that it means nothing in practical terms? It\u2019s all downside for your party and no upside.\n\nWatching Lindsey Graham, it\u2019s easy to imagine how an acquittal vote will be justified:\n\nNow that Graham is in the Senate, he\u2019ll vote to acquit \u2014 or remove \u2014 Trump if he\u2019s impeached by the House. \u201cSure. I mean \u2026 show me something that \u2026 is a crime,\u201d Graham told Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan. \u201cIf you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing.\u201d \u201cAs to asking China to look into Biden, that was stupid. \u2026 Bad idea. That didn\u2019t last very long. I think that\u2019s a frustrated Trump.\u201d But Trump\u2019s Ukraine call isn\u2019t impeachable on its own, Graham said: \u201cI\u2019ve read the transcript of the Ukrainian phone call. That\u2019s not a quid pro quo to me.\u201d\n\nPublicly calling on China to investigate the Bidens doesn\u2019t count because that was just Trump being flippant or whatever. The phone call with Zelensky isn\u2019t clear enough evidence of a quid pro quo even though Mick Mulvaney has admitted that the aid was held back in part because of Trump\u2019s interest in the CrowdStrike server, and even if it was clear evidence, it doesn\u2019t necessarily rise to the level of a federal statutory offense. If all else fails, Graham can go with \u201cbad but not impeachable\u201d to rationalize a vote to acquit. Nothing short of an outright confession by the president is going to force his hand, and even then he\u2019d probably find something in the confession that would justify voting against removal. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously contrite. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll do it again.\u201d\n\nThe ludicrous 20 percent estimate on removal from Wallace\u2019s source was probably just that person\u2019s offhand way of trying to capture how much irritation there is within the Senate GOP caucus at Trump right now.\n\nIn interviews with more than 20 GOP lawmakers and congressional aides in the past 48 hours, many said they were repulsed by Trump\u2019s decision to host an international summit at his own resort and incensed by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission \u2014 later withdrawn \u2014 that U.S. aid to Ukraine was withheld for political reasons. Others expressed anger over the president\u2019s abandonment of Kurdish allies in Syria\u2026 A few Republicans are starting to say they flat-out won\u2019t do it anymore \u2014 particularly the president\u2019s choice of his Trump National Doral Miami golf resort for next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit of world leaders, a selection that will benefit him financially. \u201cYou have to go out and try to defend him. Well, I don\u2019t know if I can do that!\u201d steamed a frustrated Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho). \u201cI have no doubt that Doral is a really good place \u2014 I\u2019ve been there, I know. But it is politically insensitive. They should have known what the kickback is going to be on this, that politically he\u2019s doing it for his own benefit.\u201d\n\nBoth WaPo and the NYT claimed this morning that it was anger from Republicans within Congress, not Democrats, at Trump\u2019s G7 gambit that convinced him to give up on the idea. (Weirdly, Trump cited opposition from Dems and the media for his decision to reverse himself, a strange play for a guy whose entire brand is never backing down to the partisan enemy.) The 20 percent figure, although grossly exaggerated, may be a polite way of signaling enough bull***t already to the president. At a moment when the GOP is struggling to spin the Ukraine business *and* the Syria withdrawal for him, it\u2019s intolerable that he would put them in the position of having to defend corruption as blatant as handing the G7 to his resort as well. The more likely he thinks removal is \u2014 even though it\u2019s almost impossible \u2014 the more willing he might be to behave himself for the next couple of months while the impeachment saga plays out. At least make it easy for Republicans to go into the tank for him, for cripes sake.", "description": "What?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
