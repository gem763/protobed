If no candidate wins an outright majority in Saturday's vote, a run-off election between the top two will be held on Nov. 16.\n\n\"I need you to send the radical Democrat establishment a loud and clear message,\" Trump said at his Friday rally. \"You are going to fire your Democrat governor who is doing a lousy job.\"\n\nEdwards was a U.S. Army captain and a lawyer before being elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 2008. He became governor after winning 56 percent of the vote against David Vitter, a Republican, in 2015.\n\nHe has generally avoided criticizing Trump, saying the two have worked well together on criminal justice reform.\n\nEdwards spent election day encouraging people to vote in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, pausing in the morning to meet with city officials and first responders after a construction site in New Orleans collapsed, killing at least one person.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by David Gregorio)", "description": "Louisiana voters were casting ballots on Saturday in the governor's race, with U.S. President Donald Trump urging people to choose one of two Republicans in the race to force a run-off election against incumbent John Bel Edwards, a conservative Democrat.
