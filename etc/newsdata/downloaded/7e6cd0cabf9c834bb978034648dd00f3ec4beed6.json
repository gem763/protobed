You can see it from how we train and how we play games. He conveys his desire to the players and is positive for both the club and the team in general.\"\n\nThis week sees Sanchez return to former club Barcelona in a crucial Champions League clash at Camp Nou.\n\nInter could only draw at home to Slavia Prague in their Group F opener while Barca were held to a draw away to Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\"When I arrived, there was talk that it might be the best Barcelona [team] in history,\" Sanchez, who won La Liga in 2012-13, said.\n\n\"There were [Pep] Guardiola, [Lionel] Messi, Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta and [Carles] Puyol, who is the best captain I've ever known in my career.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It was great. Barcelona taught me a different style of play, based on ball possession. Plus, I had team-mates you could give the ball to, knowing that then they would give it back to you perfectly.\n\n\"If you train with such strong players you can only improve. I try to improve myself every day and this helped me grow as a player.\n\n\"At Barcelona I learned a lot, in the sense that I grew up. There were great players who had won the World Cup and they allowed me to improve day after day, even physically.\"", "description": "After struggling to make an impact for Manchester United, a loan move to Inter has restored the love of the game for Alexis Sanchez.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UGIUBhrB4lJ9Q8sN7pAfAA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qqRFTl0P0vzifUqeAAzS1Q--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/9709e6622904cbe354bd19e83f507558"}
