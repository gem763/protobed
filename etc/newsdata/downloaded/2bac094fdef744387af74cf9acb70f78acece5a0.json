It was not a relationship.\"\n\nHow has Matt Lauer responded?\n\nIn a lengthy letter issued by his lawyer to Variety, Mr Lauer said he has refrained from speaking out until now on such \"false and salacious allegations\" in order to protect his children.\n\nHe rubbished the claim as \"part of a promotional effort to sell a book\".\n\nHe continued: \"It is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault.\n\n\"It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\"\n\nImage copyright Mike Pont/Getty Images Image caption Ronan Farrow received a Pulitzer Prize for his work reporting on sexual harassment\n\nHe continued: \"There was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter.\"\n\nMr Lauer concludes: \"I have never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period.\"\n\nHe was co-host of NBC's flagship Today programme for two decades.\n\nShortly before his dismissal, he had signed a new contract with the network worth a reported $20m (\u00a316m) annually.\n\nHow did the complaint come to light?\n\nAccording to Mr Farrow, Ms Nevils did not report the incident until 2017 as the #MeToo movement gained strength.\n\nImage copyright Janette Pellegrini Image caption Matt Lauer and his former co-host Meredith Vieira\n\nMs Nevils filed a formal complaint with NBC's office of human resources at the urging of former Today show co-anchor Meredith Vieira.\n\nMr Lauer was fired the next day.\n\nBut Ms Nevils told Mr Farrow that she soon learned NBC News executives were \"emphasising that the incident had not been 'criminal' or an 'assault'\".\n\nShe took a leave of absence in 2018, before leaving the network.\n\nMr Farrow writes in his book: \"NBC proposed a script she would have to read, suggesting that she had left to pursue other endeavors, that she was treated well, and that NBC News was a positive example of sexual harassment.\"\n\nHow has NBC responded to the latest allegation?\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, NBC said: \"Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time.\n\n\"That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\"\n\nSpeaking on NBC's morning show on Wednesday, anchor Savannah Guthrie - Mr Lauer's former co-host - called the new revelations \"shocking and appalling\".\n\nHoda Kotb, who was announced as Mr Lauer's replacement in early 2018, echoed Ms Guthrie.\n\n\"We don't know all the facts in all of this, but they are not allegations of an affair, they are allegations of a crime,\" she said.\n\nMr Farrow's book also accuses NBC, which formerly employed him, of obstructing his investigation into Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nHis reporting, ultimately published in the New Yorker magazine, brought about the downfall of Mr Weinstein and won Mr Farrow a Pulitzer.\n\nMr Weinstein has been criminally charged and denies all accusations of nonconsensual sex.", "description": "A former colleague of the ex-morning host says he raped her while covering the 2014 Sochi Olympics.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/18067/production/_109170489_gettyimages-455967714.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
