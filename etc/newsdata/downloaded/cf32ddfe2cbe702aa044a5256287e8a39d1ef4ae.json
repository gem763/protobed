He controlled England\u2019s quarter-final victory over Australia.\n\nGarc\u00e8s was in charge when England lost to Wales in the 2015 World Cup, a defeat that sent them towards the exit door of the tournament they were hosting, but since then they have won five of the seven Tests when he has been the referee, including the 32-20 victory over Ireland in Dublin at the start of this year\u2019s Six Nations. He was in the middle when the Lions won the second Test in Wellington in 2017 to level the series with the All Blacks and sent off Sonny Bill Williams for a dangerous tackle.\n\nSupporters in South Africa launched a petition last week to have Garc\u00e8s removed from the semi-final against Wales, not just because of the Springboks\u2019 poor record under him but because of his handling of their opening match this tournament against New Zealand. And he sent off the centre Damian de Allende against the All Blacks in 2017 for a late and dangerous challenge, a decision that was later downgraded to a yellow card by a judicial committee.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s \u2018Beast\u2019 impatient to lock horns against England | Robert Kitson Read more\n\n\u201cHe is a good ref, not one-sided at all,\u201d said the South Africa scrum-half, Faf de Klerk. \u201cWe can learn from the semi-final and the first game as well about how he sees things. As players we should get into his head as quickly as possible to see how he wants the game to go and don\u2019t get on his wrong side. It will be a massive contest and we will let him do his thing so the game should flow nicely.\u201d\n\nWales\u2019s Nigel Owens, who refereed the 2015 final, had expected to be appointed with Wayne Barnes ruled out because of England\u2019s involvement, but he ruled himself out because of a calf injury. Jaco Peyper, who was disciplined by World Rugby and scratched from the semi-final list after posing with a mocking group of Wales supporters hours after sending off the France lock S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina in the Oita quarter-final, will run the line along with Pascal Gauzere.", "description": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s will referee the Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa on Saturday, the first Frenchman to be given the honour", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4ce137316fb9d7cc554719204e0d94db0a423dd/0_43_2444_1466/master/2444.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b21b350bbdac443ee2791c4e5ad6f50a", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
