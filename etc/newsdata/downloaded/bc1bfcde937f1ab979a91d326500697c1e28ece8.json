The whole retail sector is going through a seismic model shift.\n\nFor larger UK retailers, store-based profit margins have halved in the last eight years.\n\n'Most of the UK's biggest retail brands are in the midst of a fight for survival.\n\n'We have already seen some high-profile casualties, and many more are on life support.'\n\nThe report's authors predicted a High Street with smaller stores, acting as a shop window for a larger range of products sold online.", "description": "Changing consumer habits, unfair business rates and rising staff costs are hitting the UK's biggest chains leading to more store closures than ever before, according to research by A&M.", "authors": ["City", "Finance Reporter For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
