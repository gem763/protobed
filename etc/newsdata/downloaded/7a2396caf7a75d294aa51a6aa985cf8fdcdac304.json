REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2% with Japan\u2019s Nikkei up 0.5% at a one-year high. Australian shares climbed 0.5% while South Korea\u2019s KOSPI inched 0.4% higher.\n\nSouth Korea earlier reported third quarter growth slightly below expectations, though exports showed signs of recovery, while a private survey showed Japanese factory activity shrank at the fastest pace in over three years in October, hurt by slowing global demand and trade frictions.\n\nOn Wall Street overnight, the Dow and the Nasdaq added 0.2% each while the S&P 500 gained 0.3%.\n\nTelsa shares jumped 21% in after-hours trading following a surprise third quarter profit.\n\nMicrosoft also posted forecast-beating profit and revenue numbers after the closing bell though the outlook was darkened by slower-than-expected take-up of its Azure cloud services.\n\nEarlier, shares of U.S. industrial bellwethers Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc ended about 1% higher each despite big earnings misses.\n\nRBC Capital Markets\u2019 chief economist Tom Porcelli pointed to consistently alarming headlines since the first quarter of 2018 suggesting poor Caterpillar earnings meant a recession was round the corner, though that has yet to transpire.\n\n\u201cWe have been down this road before with CAT,\u201d Porcelli said in a note titled \u2018Still Waiting For Recession.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf you keep saying a recession is here, it is a mathematical certainty that at some point you will be right,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMaybe try again after CAT\u2019s next quarterly earnings report.\u201d\n\nSo far, results from about 125 of the S&P500 companies are out with analysts expecting earnings to have declined 2.9% year-over-year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nRisk appetite was also aided by a ceasefire in northern Syria which resulted in the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Turkey.\n\nLater in the day, European and U.S. manufacturing numbers are due while the European Central Bank meets, with no change to policy expected at President Mario Draghi\u2019s last meeting. Draghi will be replaced by Christine Lagarde.\n\nActivity in the currency market was rather muted.\n\nSterling paused at $1.2918 after rising 0.3% on Wednesday with Brexit developments in focus.\n\nBritain appears closer than ever to resolving its 3-1/2-year Brexit conundrum but there are still hurdles to clear.\n\nEU member states on Wednesday delayed a decision on whether to grant Britain a three-month Brexit extension. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said if the deadline is deferred to the end of January, he would call an election.\n\n\u201cThe Brexit battle looks like it will drag on,\u201d economists at ANZ wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cThe UK government will not meet its current timetable of leaving the EU on 31 October, and an extension appears likely. In the meantime, Brexit uncertainty will keep weighing on UK business investment and activity.\u201d\n\nThe single currency was flat at $1.1135. The Japanese yen was a shade higher at 108.62 per dollar while the Australian dollar was barely changed at $0.6852.\n\nThat left the dollar index mostly unchanged at 97.461 against a basket of six major currencies.\n\nIn commodity markets, U.S. crude eased 30 cents to $55.67 while Brent slipped 28 cents to $60.89.\n\nGold was treading water at $1,492.5 an ounce.", "description": "Asian shares pulled ahead on Thursday with corporate earnings buffeting trading as investors remained anxious about the business impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war while Brexit uncertainties kept overall sentiment in check.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444315105&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N01D-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
