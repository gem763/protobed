Is an impeachment process underway or not? Is this impeachment by another name? Is this impeachment-lite?\n\nCNBC\u2019s John Harwood tweeted Saturday:\n\n\u201cis whistle-blower/Ukraine situation changing Pelosi\u2019s view on potential Trump impeachment? adviser tells me: \u2018no. see any GOP votes for it?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe followed up Sunday, tweeting:\n\n\u201csenior Dem aide on Speaker/impeachment: \u2018contrary to popular belief, Pelosi isn\u2019t giving members a red light. She\u2019s telling them to do what\u2019s right for them and their district. But Ukraine stuff may be breaking point. goes to whether we can actually have free/fair 2020 election\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is possible, but Pelosi is weighing another concern: Maintaining Democratic control of the House and her own speakership. There is a school of thought that a vote to impeach in the House that is met with a refusal to convict and remove in Moscow Mitch McConnell\u2019s Senate will be viewed as a \u201cfailed impeachment,\u201d would put the country through unnecessary strife and might turn swing voters against the Democrats or rile up Republicans to vote for Trump.\n\nThe first rule of politics is self-preservation, and everyone in Washington is following that rule to the letter. But as they do, the country suffers. The country succumbs. The country collapses.\n\nTrump thinks that the idea of Congress as a coequal branch of government is largely a tradition and convention, even though it is written as so in the Constitution. Trump, however, knows that the enforcement mechanisms are weak and rusty. To a large degree, Congress will have to fight his obstruction in the courts, where cases can have a long horizon. He can simply run out the clock, or stall as the sting of an accusation dulls in the public consciousness.\n\nThe public is being told that the only real, meaningful remedy to the Trump problem is to defeat him at the polls next year. But that is by no means a surety. As Nate Cohn wrote in The Times in July, Trump could lose even more of the popular vote next year and still win the Electoral College by an even larger margin than in 2016.", "description": "America\u2019s vulnerability is exploited by its president.", "authors": ["Charles M.
