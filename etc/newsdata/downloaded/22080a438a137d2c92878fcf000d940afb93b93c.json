We always say cattle are vegetarian. But cattle from Calangute have turned non-vegetarian and do not eat grass, gram or the special cattle feed given to them,\" Lobo said, on the sidelines of a village function in Arpora village in North Goa on Saturday.\n\n\"The cattle from Calangute and Candolim are used to eating non-vegetarian food like leftover chicken scraps, stale fried fish from restaurants. Due to consumption of such non-vegetarian food, their system has become like that of humans. Earlier they were vegetarian, pure vegetarian. They would smell non-vegetarian food and move on, but now cattle from Calangute only eat non-vegetarian food,\" he said.\n\n\"Specialist veterinarians have been roped in by the gaushala to medically treat the cattle with medicine. It will take them four to five days to turn them into vegetarians once again,\" said Lobo, who is a former deputy speaker.\n\nBCCL\n\nThe beach villages of Calangute and Candolim in North Goa annually receive the highest number of tourists, both domestic and international, and have a high density of restaurants and eateries. The two villages also have a high concentration of cattle, several of which have met with road accidents.\n\nStray cattle have been a menace on Goa's roads for more than two decades on account of factors such as increase in vehicular density, poor lighting on roads, a waning interest in agriculture, fear of cow vigilantes cracking down on 'illegal slaughter\u2019 of bovines and errant cattle owners, who abandon the beasts when they are advanced in age and unproductive.\n\nConcerned by the rising number of accidents caused by stray cattle and to combat the menace, the Goa government had even launched a special scheme to address the issue in 2013, which involved providing incentives to village panchayats and municipal bodies to impound stray cattle and fine their owners.\u200b", "description": "There has been a rising emphasis over the need for humans to turn vegetarian against the backdrop of several reasons such as cruelty to animals and also the preservation of the environment.
