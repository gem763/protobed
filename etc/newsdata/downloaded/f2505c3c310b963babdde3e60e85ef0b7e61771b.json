We have a Second Amendment,\" Trump continued. \"I don't want to have crazy people have guns. I don't want to have bad people have guns. But, we're going to do nothing to hurt the Second Amendment.

A lot of people think this is just a way of taking away guns. And that's not good. Because we're not going to allow that.\n\n\"Look, I'm a very strong believer in the Second Amendment,\" Trump continued. \"We're going to protect our Second Amendment.
