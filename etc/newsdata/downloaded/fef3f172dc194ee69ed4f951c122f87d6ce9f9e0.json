Eleven women were inducted.\n\nOf all the accomplished women in America, The National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame, located in Seneca Falls, New York, chose to induct a domestic terrorist and an American traitor among the eleven women. Angela Davis and Jane Fonda made the cut this year.\n\nThe Twitter bio of the Hall of Fame reads as follows: \u201cOfficial Account for the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame: America\u2019s oldest organization dedicated to showcasing great women and inspiring all .\u201d So, experience tells me that if an organization was established in 1969, as it was, to recognize \u201cgreat\u201d women, it will be chock-full of liberal women, not conservatives. It seems the bar is now so low that terrorists and traitors are lumped in with other inductees this year \u2013 a Supreme Court Justice (Sotomayer) and a combat veteran and first woman Thunderbird pilot (Nicole Malachowski).\n\nGretchen Carlson, known for filing a sexual harassment complaint against the chairman of Fox News in 2016 after leaving the network after many years as an on-air personality, acted as emcee. She had a swell time with the women.\n\nSuch an awesome day and so exciting to emcee @womenofthehall\u2019s amazing event. Here\u2019s another legendary inductee to the class of 2019, @Janefonda! #hallintroduction2019 pic.twitter.com/WhMWVjGQz4 \u2014 Gretchen Carlson (@GretchenCarlson) September 15, 2019\n\nThrilled to meet the brilliant Honorable Justice Sonia Sotomayor!

Ret., Activist\n\nRose O\u2019Neill, Artist & Activist\n\nLouise Slaughter, Former U.S. Congress member, Advocate\n\nSonia Sotomayor, U.S. Supreme Court Justice\n\nLaurie Spiegel, Composer\n\nDiane von Furstenberg, Fashion Designer & Philanthropist\n\nFlossie Wong-Staal, Biologist\n\nI\u2019m old enough to remember the stories of earlier years in the lives of Angela Davis and Jane Fonda. Both women have been mainstreamed into American society after some odious past behavior. Both women should be shunned but are hailed by liberal America.\n\nAngela Davis, now 75 years old, was a member of the Communist Party from the 1960s to the 1990s. She is known for her membership in the Black Panthers Party during the Civil Rights movement. She spent time on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted list in October 1970.\n\nAngela Yvonne Davis was placed on the Ten Most Wanted list in October of 1970, after investigators learned that the Black Panther and Communist activist had purchased the weapons used in a hostage situation. Davis had purchase weapons for Jonathan P. Jackson, who stormed a courtroom in Marin County, CA and took Judge Harold Haley and three jurors hostage in order to negotiate the freedom of \u201cThe Soledad Brothers,\u201d three African-American prisoners accused of murdering a white prison guard. On October 13, 1970, police captured Davis. Unlike most of her female counterparts on the list, Davis was acquitted on all charges and went on to have a successful career.\n\nDavis went on to be a professor at the University of California \u2013 Santa Cruz, though in 1969 then-Governor Ronald Reagan tried to get her banned from teaching because of her membership in the Communist Party. While a member of the Black Panthers, she purchased firearms for personal security guards. The guards used them in the 1970 armed takeover of a Marin County, California, courtroom, in which four people were killed. Though prosecuted for three capital felonies, including conspiracy to murder, she was acquitted of the charges. As a professor in California, she was able to get on with her life and over time was able to gloss over her years with domestic terrorists.\n\nThe image of Black Panthers is being remade into that of a group of community activists who simply went about doing good work in their neighborhoods, like free breakfast programs for poor inner-city school children.\n\nJane Fonda became a traitor to many Americans when she traveled to Hanoi in 1972 during the Vietnam war. She was photographed sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun. She earned her nickname \u201cHanoi Jane\u201d. She should be referred to in that way for the rest of her life. She returned home and went about her life. She\u2019s 81 years old now and has enjoyed a life of fabulous fame and wealth within the entertainment industry. She continues to be active in the politics of the far left.\n\nMore \u2018normal\u2019 public figures inducted included the late Congresswoman Louise Slaughter. I\u2019m not exactly sure what her granddaughter refers to as she accepted on behalf of her grandmother, but so be it.\n\nThe late Congresswoman Louise Slaughter\u2019s granddaughter, Lauren Secatore, accepted the honor on behalf of her grandmother. \u201cMy grandmother didn\u2019t get here because she was forging a path for herself, but because she was thinking about other women and other men. Those who look like you, those who do not.\u201d\n\nAccording to this article, the process of choosing inductees goes as follows:\n\nThe women were nominated by the public. They were then chosen by a special team based off of their impact on specific areas. These included art, athletics, education, government, and science.\n\nNaturally, there is a political component to all this. Because 2019.\n\nDr. Sujatha Ramanujan, chair for the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame induction ceremony, said that although the hall does not apply a theme for its nominations, a theme emerged this year that reflected \u201cthe political and social mood of the country,\u201d according to the news agency. \u201cIt shows up in the nominations because we ask the general public, and in a time when women are feeling like their voices need to be heard, they\u2019re nominating women whose voices were loud,\u201d she said.\n\nNormalizing women with pasts in domestic terrorism and traitorous acts against America, especially during a time of war, is not acceptable. I\u2019ll never be woke enough to accept it.", "description": "And a Supreme Court Justice.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/JaneFonda.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
