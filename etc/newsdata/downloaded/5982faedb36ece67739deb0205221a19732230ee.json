Bush, announced Monday that he quit the Republican Party because of its acquiescence to President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a blog post amplified by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, Mankiw revealed he\u2019d just \u201cswitched my voter registration from Republican to unenrolled (aka independent)\u201d for two reasons.\n\nGreg Mankiw, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for President George W Bush: \u201cI am no longer a Republican\u201d https://t.co/RubErDPxac \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 28, 2019\n\n\u201cToo many Republicans in Congress are willing, in the interest of protecting their jobs, to overlook Trump\u2019s misdeeds (just as too many Democrats were for Clinton during his impeachment),\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in associating myself with that behavior,\u201d Mankiw said. \u201cMaybe someday, the party will return to having honorable leaders like Bush, McCain, and Romney. Until then, count me out.\u201d\n\nSecondly, Mankiw explained how unenrolled voters in his home state of Massachusetts can vote in either the Democratic or Republican primaries.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party is at a crossroads, where it has to choose either a center-left candidate (Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Yang) or a far-left populist (Warren, Sanders) as their nominee for president,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI intend to help them choose the former. The latter propose to move the country too far in the direction of heavy-handed state control,\u201d Mankiw concluded. \u201cAnd in doing so, they tempt those in the center and center-right to hold their noses and vote for Trump\u2019s reelection.\u201d", "description": "\"Maybe someday, the party will return to having honorable leaders like Bush, McCain, and Romney,\" Greg Mankiw wrote in a blog post.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db7df14210000243bad4316.jpeg?cache=zlj2rzfrak&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
