Photo: Taso Katopodis/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Friday, Donald Trump\u2019s White House admitted it had overseen 1,556 more family separations than previously acknowledged. Of these, more than 1,000 were carried out after a federal court had ordered the administration to keep migrant families intact. The total number of asylum-seeking families broken up by our government now sits at approximately 5,500. Many of these parents and children have yet to reunite. Some never will.\n\nTwo days after this disclosure, the president attended a baseball game. When his image flashed above the outfield in Nationals Park, the crowd\u2019s cheers turned into boos, which then \u2014 in some sections of the stadium \u2014 turned into chants of \u201cLock him up.\u201d\n\nOn cable news Monday morning, one of these developments registered as an attack on American ideals so obscene, it demanded bipartisan condemnation; the other, a banal event that scarcely merited a mention.\n\n\u201cEven at a time when there is a lot that our president does that I find disturbing, offensive, unconventional, I have a hard time with the idea of a crowd \u2014 on a globally televised sporting event \u2014 chanting \u2018lock him up\u2019 about our president,\u201d Democratic senator Chris Coons said on CNN. \u201cI frankly think the office of the president deserves respect, even when the actions of our president at times don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nJUST NOW: Dem Sen @ChrisCoons not happy with the \"Lock him up \" chants at World Series last night.\n\n\n\n\"Frankly think the office of the president deserves respect, even when the actions of our president at times don't. \"@NewDay pic.twitter.com/OJwZfv9Vp8 \u2014 John Berman (@JohnBerman) October 28, 2019\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, meanwhile, decried the crowd\u2019s chant as \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cfascist.\u201d \u201cWe are Americans, and we do not do that,\u201d Scarborough said, upbraiding the Nationals\u2019 faithful in the tone of a father who is less angry than disappointed. \u201cWe do not want the world hearing us chant \u2018Lock him up\u2019 to this president or to any president \u2026 [as though] you\u2019re going to actually imprison your political opponents.\u201d\n\nMany of Twitter\u2019s self-styled defenders of democratic norms echoed this assessment. \u201cPublicly calling for your political opponents to be jailed without due process is an authoritarian strategy even when liberals do it,\u201d George Mason University political scientist Jennifer Victor explained. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s much worse to hear it from elected leaders than spontaneously from an unprompted crowd, but still. This is #polarization.\u201d\n\nIt is, of course, understandable that commentators would devote less attention Monday to a days-old development in the family-separation saga than to a World Series crowd calling for the president\u2019s imprisonment. What\u2019s harder to comprehend, in my view, is how Coons & Co. can reconcile their vehement denunciations of the latter with the bare facts of the former \u2014 let alone with the broader context of presidential lawlessness from which those 1,000 extralegal family separations emerged.\n\nTake Victor\u2019s assertion that the Nationals crowd was calling for its \u201cpolitical opponents to be jailed without due process.\u201d Ignore, for the moment, the false equivalency embedded in this phrasing (which casts Trump and booing Nationals fans as a pair of \u201cpolitical opponents,\u201d rather than as a head of state and constituents subject to his authority). On what basis does Victor interpret the crowd\u2019s chant as a call for the suspension of the rule of law, rather than as a demand for its reassertion?\n\nWhen thousands of South Koreans took to the streets in 2016 \u201cpublicly calling\u201d for the arrest of their corrupt president, few political scientists decried their dissent as an authoritarian assault on due process. When thousands of Venezuelans shouted similar demands in Caracas last year, U.S. lawmakers celebrated their democratic spirit. In these contexts, our political class has little difficulty understanding that calls for a lawless leader to face legal consequences are the opposite of authoritarian \u2014 or that mass dissent can serve as a backstop for democracy when presidents immunize themselves from formal systems of accountability.\n\nBy the time Trump\u2019s face appeared onscreen in Nationals Park Sunday, the president had:\n\n\u2022 Stated publicly, and repeatedly, that he believes the U.S. attorney general\u2019s first responsibility is to \u201cprotect\u201d him from legal scrutiny.\n\n\u2022 Fired and replaced the leadership of the FBI and DOJ for displaying insufficient personal loyalty to him.\n\n\u2022 Intervened in a federal investigation in ways that a prosecutor could potentially consider obstruction of justice, according to the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\n\u2022 Publicly argued that he has an absolute right to coerce foreign governments into launching investigations of his political opponents.\n\n\u2022 Withheld congressionally approved military aid to a U.S. ally under attack so as to coerce the Ukrainian government into launching an investigation of the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 front-runner, according to the sworn testimony of multiple administration officials.\n\n\u2022 Ordered his subordinates to turn away any and all asylum-seekers at the southern border, in defiance of federal and international law \u2014 while promising those subordinates he would use his pardon power to insulate those who carried out his lawless directives from the threat of legal accountability, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u2022 Fired and replaced the DHS officials who most vocally resisted his extralegal demands.\n\nIn other words: The president has publicly declared his contempt for the rule of law and attempted to subvert it in myriad ways \u2014 including ones that threaten to insulate him from the threat of legal or even electoral accountability.\n\nMeanwhile, an executive-branch agency has unilaterally declared that a sitting president is immune from federal law as long as he or she remains in office. Thus the only immediate constraint on our avowedly tyrannical president\u2019s authority is the threat of impeachment and removal \u2014 which, given the composition of the Senate, strikes most political observers as no constraint at all.\n\nIn this context, is a \u201cLock him up\u201d chant really a more harrowing sign of creeping authoritarianism than a display of polite tolerance for the tyrant-in-chief would be? The former involves citizens ironically repurposing their abusive leader\u2019s own demagoguery to protest his lawlessness. The latter assures that leader that he is not only above the law but also immune from social sanction.\n\nTo conclude that the \u201cLock him up\u201d chant was an affront to democratic values rather than an expression of them, Victor and Scarborough must ignore most of the relevant context, impute the darkest possible intention to the chanters, and wildly misconstrue their relationship with Trump. Nationals fans are not the president\u2019s political opponents; they are his constituents. And their conflict is not rooted (solely) in disagreements about policies and values; Trump enjoys extraordinary power over the chanters\u2019 lives, a power he routinely abuses, in Victor\u2019s and Scarborough\u2019s own estimations.\n\nA stronger version of the anti-chant argument would focus on its potential consequences, rather than its moral character: Chanting \u201cLock him up\u201d at Trump may be a worthy expression of democratic dissent in the abstract, but in our hyperpolarized polity, it risks eroding norms of partisan toleration and emboldening the reactionary right.\n\nAnd yet, while this argument at least does not require misrepresenting Sunday night\u2019s events, it rests more on faith than evidence. After all, what in the past three years (or past two decades) of American politics suggests that the center-left\u2019s good faith and performative respect for institutional traditions will constrain the right\u2019s illiberalism and abuses of power? (Did Nancy Pelosi\u2019s painstakingly slow, deliberate approach to impeachment prevent Republicans from casting her inquiry as a \u201cSoviet-style witch hunt?\u201d Did Barack Obama\u2019s refusal to publicly disclose the FBI\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign before Election Day 2016 prevent Republican leaders from accusing him of orchestrating that investigation for electoral purposes?)\n\nThe indiscriminate \u201crespect for the office of the president\u201d that Coons counsels has done little to arrest our republic\u2019s descent into lawlessness. If anything, it has hastened that regression: What, other than such \u201crespect,\u201d enabled the DOJ to insist, without controversy, that Donald Trump can\u2019t be held legally accountable for federal crimes until he leaves office? Or the Obama administration to insist, with self-righteousness, that George W. Bush must not be held legally accountable for his abuses of power upon returning to private life?\n\nAmericans did not win their republic by respecting the offices of tyrants (whether those tyrants occupied the throne in 18th-century London or the plantations of 19th-century Richmond). We\u2019ll need a little less reflexive deference to decorum \u2014 and a little more \u201cNattitude\u201d \u2014 if we wish to keep it.", "description": "At Game 5 of the World Series Sunday night, a crowd of Nationals fans booed president Trump and chanted \u201clock him up.\u201d Democratic senator Chris Coons and MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough decried the chants as authoritarian.
