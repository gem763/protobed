'Maybe this buys us some goodwill. This helps them too.'\n\n'We helped our people,' said Michonne (Danai Gurira). 'That's enough good for me for now.'\n\nTheir tactical training had served the group well; they spent that morning doing military exercises on the beach, armed with spiky shields, archery bows, swords, and other weapons.\n\nRight choice: 'We made the right choice,' considered Aaron (Ross Marquand), looking around into the smoky, ruined forest.

If there's a mask, maybe there are other signs of them out there.'\n\nMichonne led six survivors out on horseback to investigate, with everyone pairing up.\n\nMichonne: Michonne led six survivors out on horseback to investigate, with everyone pairing up\n\n'Michonne, are we the good guys?' Aaron asked her, as they rode along together.\n\n'I think about it a lot,' he offered. 'We're the villains of someone else's story\u2014a threat to their survival. So dangerous they threatened to wipe us out. Makes you wonder sometimes.'\n\n'I don't give a s*** about the Whisperers or where they stand,' Michonne retorted.\n\n'I'm not just talking about the Whisperers,' Aaron replied.\n\nGood guys: 'Michonne, are we the good guys?' Aaron asked her, as they rode along together\n\nWhisperers: 'I'm not just talking about the Whisperers,' Aaron replied\n\nHe suddenly darted off after some walkers he saw on a bridge in the distance, which upset Michonne, who'd lost her love Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) in a similar situation.\n\nShe rode over to save Aaron from the walkers' grabbing hands, not entirely sure if they were real walkers or Whisperers wearing the walkers' skin.\n\n'Well, that was stupid!' Michonne yelled after him as he strode off. 'We agreed not to cross their borders or to start anything without a reason.'\n\nDarted off: He suddenly darted off after some walkers he saw on a bridge in the distance, which upset Michonne, who'd lost her love Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) in a similar situation\n\nNot sure: She rode over to save Aaron from the walkers' grabbing hands, not entirely sure if they were real walkers or Whisperers wearing the walkers' skin\n\n'If it was them, you could have died,' she pointed out. 'And if it wasn't them, you could have died. For what?'\n\n'We've all been acting like this is normal,' Aaron explained. 'Holding our breaths for months. This isn't normal.'\n\n'We have to keep our cool, or they win,' Michonne retorted.\n\n'I've been keeping my cool my whole life,' Aaron emphasized. 'I've always been the nice guy. The good Samaritan. [But] I'm goddamn sick of being nice.'\n\n'Well, good,' Michonne said. 'Cause nice never got me anywhere. But smart did.'\n\nDied: 'If it was them, you could have died,' she pointed out. 'And if it wasn't them, you could have died. For what?'\n\nKeep cool: 'We have to keep our cool, or they win,' Michonne retorted\n\n'They have a nuclear weapon, and we don't,' she highlighted. 'It's not about being nice or good, or anything but keeping our people alive and not having them die over nothing.'\n\nAs the two of them circled back, Yumiko (Eleanor Matsuura) drew their attention to a campsite with dead bodies and skeletons spread around, flies buzzing.\n\nThere was a human skin draped over a nearby log, which Aaron lifted with a stick, realizing that 'at least one of them has been on our side of the border at some point.'\n\nNuclear: 'They have a nuclear weapon, and we don't,' she highlighted. 'It's not about being nice or good, or anything but keeping our people alive and not having them die over nothing'\n\nYumiko: As the two of them circled back, Yumiko (Eleanor Matsuura) drew their attention to a campsite with dead bodies and skeletons spread around, flies buzzing\n\n'Yeah, but when?' Yukiko asked. 'And what the hell happened here?'\n\nBack at Oceanside, Michonne told Aaron she sensed what was coming next, noting: 'Fear is dangerous. It can drive us apart again. And we're gonna need to squash it before it starts.'\n\n'But fear can also keep us safe,' Aaron said. 'I forgot that on the bridge.'\n\n'I was telling you to be smart, not afraid,' Michonne replied. 'I've been thinking about what you said earlier\u2014about who we've become. Who we are. And the truth is, we are the good guys.'\n\nGood guys: 'I was telling you to be smart, not afraid,' Michonne replied. 'I've been thinking about what you said earlier\u2014about who we've become. Who we are. And the truth is, we are the good guys'\n\n'We have to choose to be the good guys, even when it's hard. And the minute that we start to question that, we lose sight of it. That's when the answer to that question starts to change.'\n\n'And that's scarier than any skin mask.'\n\nIn the distance, Michonne heard Judith telling RJ the story of Rick's death, calling him The Brave Man and recalling how he walked to the bridge and led the walkers away.\n\nBrave Man: In the distance, Michonne heard Judith telling RJ the story of Rick's death, calling him The Brave Man and recalling how he walked to the bridge and led the walkers away\n\n'The Brave Man couldn't let the walkers reach his friends and hurt them, so he blew up the bridge and all the walkers fell into the water, and he saved all of his friends,' she said.\n\n'Will he come back someday like the walkers?' RJ asked.\n\n'No, not like that,' Judith admitted. 'But people like The Brave Man are never really gone anyway. He lives inside our hearts and makes us brave, too.'\n\nMichonne approached and hugged them with tears in her eyes.\n\nNot coming back: 'No, not like that,' Judith admitted. 'But people like The Brave Man are never really gone anyway. He lives inside our hearts and makes us brave, too'\n\n'Mama, I didn't like when The Brave Man died. Why did he do that?' RJ asked.\n\n'Well, there are some people that you love so much that you would do anything for them, just like I would do anything for you and for Judith,' Michonne explained.\n\n'And my dad?' RJ asked.\n\n'Yes. And your dad.'\n\nAs she hugged them, there was an explosion of bright light in the sky, like a meteor shower.\n\nHugs: As she hugged them, there was an explosion of bright light in the sky, like a meteor shower\n\nThe perspective then shifted to Alexandria, where Eugene Blacknell and the Savonics' 1960s tune I'm so Thankful played over the radio.\n\nIn a classroom, Lydia (Cassidy McClincy) struggled to read and grew frustrated.\n\n'You're picking it up so quick,' the teacher reassured her.

'Now? Well, now I'm the guy the picks the vegetables and takes out the trash. I'm okay with that. For now, at least.'\n\nFather Stokes: Negan: Father Gabriel Stokes (Seth Gilliam) then went to see Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) in his cell, teasing him that he didn't expect to see him there so early in the day\n\nPublic enemy: 'Yesterday, I was public enemy number one,' Negan began. 'Now? Well, now I'm the guy the picks the vegetables and takes out the trash. I'm okay with that. For now, at least'\n\nNegan was afraid he would become an outcast if war broke out between the groups, and urged Gabriel to make everyone feel more secure about what was happening.\n\nGabriel walked outside and told his crew to lock the gates and double up security\u2014then he, too, saw the explosion, and Eugene running to radio Oceanside.\n\n'Something of grave importance is about to happen,' Eugene relayed.\n\nAfraid: Negan was afraid he would become an outcast if war broke out between the groups, and urged Gabriel to make everyone feel more secure about what was happening.\n\nAt Oceanside, Connie (Lauren Ridloff), who was deaf, ran into Daryl by the water. He had a sign language guide in his pocket, and she told him he signed 'with a Southern accent.'\n\nCarol (Melissa McBride) arrived by boat and had an awkward encounter with Ezekiel, who told her she looked good. She acknowledged the compliment, then hugged Connie and Daryl.\n\n'Did ya miss me?' she asked Daryl as he picked her up.\n\nAccent: At Oceanside, Connie (Lauren Ridloff), who was deaf, ran into Daryl by the water.

She acknowledged the compliment, then hugged Connie and Daryl\n\n'Not really,' he joked.\n\nHe asked her if she'd been off looking for Alpha.\n\n'No, honestly no,' Carol insisted. 'I tried to forget everything that happened. It was good. If we're lucky, we'll never have to think of those skin freaks ever again.'\n\nShe and Daryl went into the forest to kill walkers, and saw a deer, which she aimed at.\n\nMiss me: 'Did ya miss me?' she asked Daryl as he picked her up\n\nForget: 'No, honestly no,' Carol insisted. 'I tried to forget everything that happened. It was good. If we're lucky, we'll never have to think of those skin freaks ever again'\n\n'Stop,' Daryl said, thinking of Alpha. 'That's one of her borders.'\n\n'Why are we still respecting borders we never agreed to when Alpha isn't ever here?' Carol sighed. 'Can we just forget about them already?'\n\nWalkers set upon the deer, and then it was too late to retrieve it.\n\n'That deer could have fed 200 people,' Carol noted.\n\nBorders: 'Why are we still respecting borders we never agreed to when Alpha isn't ever here?' Carol sighed. 'Can we just forget about them already?\n\nAs they returned to Daryl's bike, he apologized for angering her, and asked her to stay on land with him, not return to the sea.\n\n'Sorry if I didn't want my best friend to spend her whole life on a boat,' he said.\n\nCarol joked that if they were besties, she should make them matching bracelets\u2014plus a matching collar for Daryl's dog, Dog.\n\n'Daryl, you ever wonder if this is all there is?' she suddenly asked. 'Just run into people, kill each other, until whoever's left says, 'Enough?'\n\nBesties: Carol joked that if they were besties, she should make them matching bracelets\u2014plus a matching collar for Daryl's dog, Dog\n\nApology: As they returned to Daryl's bike, he apologized for angering her, and asked her to stay on land with him, not return to the sea\n\nCarol asked Daryl to sail away on a boat with her, or ride motorcycles with her out West.\n\n'New Mexico,' he suggested.\n\n'What the hell's in New Mexico?' she asked.\n\n'People who weave bracelets,' he said, giving her his own.\n\n'No more fighting,' Daryl considered. 'Just get on the bike and go. See who's left.'\n\n'Sounds good to me,' Carol said, putting his bracelet on.\n\nBracelet: 'People who weave bracelets,' he said, giving her his own\n\nThey both heard the explosion, and looked up to see the satellite falling to the ground, which triggered the onset of the wildfires.\n\nLater, after the fire was out, Eugene dug into the satellite to retrieve parts of it, and answered a question from Luke (Dan Fogler) about whether they were all irradiated.\n\n'Certainly, there's radiation from space, but every one of us is already infected with some kinda nasty that changes us into epidermis Epicureans at the point of R.I.P.,' Eugene said.\n\nFire cause: They both heard the explosion, and looked up to see the satellite falling to the ground, which triggered the onset of the wildfires\n\nTech: Later, after the fire was out, Eugene dug into the satellite to retrieve parts of it, and answered a question from Luke (Dan Fogler) about whether they were all irradiated\n\nMichonne waited for him to finish, and idly wondered, 'Where are Carol and Daryl?'\n\nThe two of them were climbing a rock together to overlook the valley below.\n\n'You still wanna run away together?' Daryl asked her.\n\n'Yeah, tomorrow,' Carol replied.\n\nCarol and Daryl: Michonne waited for him to finish, and idly wondered, 'Where are Carol and Daryl?'\n\nValley: The two of them were climbing a rock together to overlook the valley below\n\n'Look, I need you to stay,' Daryl begged. 'Just think about it. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to punch holes in all them boats.'\n\nAs Daryl walked off, Carol looked down into the divide separating their land from Alpha's.\n\nSuddenly, on a distant rock, there she was: Alpha, shaking her head slowly, looking up to meet Carol's eyes.\n\nThe Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 pm EST on AMC.", "description": "Enemies Alpha and Carol came face-to-face in The Walking Dead's Season 10 premiere on Sunday, their first encounter since Alpha's group beheaded Carol's adopted son, Henry.", "authors": ["Brian Gallagher For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/07/19382822-0-image-a-209_1570430792452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
