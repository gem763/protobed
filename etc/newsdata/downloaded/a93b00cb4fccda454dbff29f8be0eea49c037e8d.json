The civil trial has been ongoing since late August; in September, a videographer who worked for Girls Do Porn testified in court that the production company lured into having sex on video after being allegedly promised the videos would never be widely distributed or posted online.\n\nMotherboard has reached out to Pornhub to ask why the videos were removed today and we'll update this article when we hear back.\n\nWomen who appeared in Girls Do Porn videos and spoke to Motherboard, as well as some of the plaintiffs in the civil suit, said that Girls Do Porn posting the videos to Pornhub led to them being doxed. Having their identities exposed to their communities and family members led several of the women in Girls Do Porn videos to endure ongoing harassment, depression, and suicidal thoughts.\n\nFollowing Motherboard's investigation in July into Pornhub's role in spreading the videos online, Pornhub talked to the lawyers of the plaintiffs in the civil suit, removed several videos from its platform, and removed Girls Do Porn from several of its promotional pages where Girls Do Porn was listed as a premium partner and provider of \"top shelf\" content.\n\nUntil today, Pornhub continued to host Girls Do Porn's official page, as well as dozens of videos with millions and millions of views. Now, Girls Do Porn's page is gone entirely. Girls Do Porn's content content also appears to be pulled from Youporn, another porn site owned by Pornhub's parent company Mindgeek.\n\nDespite Girls Do Porn's official page and videos being removed, Girls Do Porn videos continue to live on Pornhub and other sites in unofficial full videos, clips, and compilations uploaded by users.", "description": "After months of knowingly working with porn production company that was accused of lying to women, Pornhub finally removes its official page from its platform.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da4e1f4b4f1b8000960d639/lede/1571086837193-back-back-view-bed-2012156.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
