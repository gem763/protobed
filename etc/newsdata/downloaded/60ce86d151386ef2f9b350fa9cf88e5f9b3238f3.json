He says she bore down immediately on what she figured he was most concerned about, reading his shirt and promising to be his champion.\n\n\u201cWhen I got up there, she said that she is going to work on getting rid of student loan debt. I was wearing a shirt that had her picture on it and it says, \u2018Hello, do you have a moment to talk about student loan debt cancellation?\u2019\u201d says Mr Eliff, a 31-year-old law enforcement official with more than $70,000 (\u00a357,000) in student loan debt.\n\nAfter nine months of campaigning, Ms Warren now finds herself as a top contender for the Democratic nomination, and has begun to see her name on top of even Joe Biden\u2019s in polls from across the country.\n\nShe\u2019s the first Democrat so far to break that ceiling, and the rise in political fortunes for the 70-year-old has been made possible at least in part by moments just like the one with Mr Eliff. The 31-year-old is among the thousands of people to have taken a selfie with the senator this year, and says that the candidate\u2019s personal approach has all but guaranteed he will be caucusing for her come February.\n\n\u201cThe fact that she takes the time to meet with everyone tells me a lot about her. I think she cares about people. And I think people like that. Iowans appreciate the personal touch,\u201d he says. \u201cThat fact, that she waits and meets everyone, is another reason among many I endorsed her early and support her and will be caucusing for her.\u201d\n\nFor political strategists and experts, Ms Warren\u2019s pioneering of the so-called \u201cselfie line\u201d is a genius move that has helped accomplish a few different goals.\n\nFor one, the selfie lines \u2013 which Ms Warren will stick out for hours, making sure every last person who wants one will get their photo with her \u2013 allow her to make a personal connection directly with voters. They also show her stamina: what unhealthy person is able to stand for hours greeting strangers day in and day out?\n\nBut they also give Ms Warren, who makes the time for the photo lines by refusing the time-suck of big fundraisers with millionaires, the chance to wade in directly with her would-be constituents \u2013 who then help out by posting those same selfies all across the internet.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, selfies on Instagram have become the new yard signs. Where people see the candidate out from behind the curtain, and see that their friend or their neighbour or their family member is promoting them,\u201d says Jesse Ferguson, the former deputy national press secretary for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s powerful,\u201d he continues, noting that, unlike physical yard signs, selfies can pop up anywhere in your \u201cdigital neighbourhood\u201d \u2013 not just on the drive to the polls.\n\nAnd, in an age when earning a viral moment can make or break a campaign, Ms Warren\u2019s approach can make the anonymised experience of the internet somewhat personal, too.\n\n\u201cYes, many candidates have \u2018viral moments\u2019 but Warren may be one step ahead with her person-to-person strategy because it allows both the voter and Warren to have the viral moment together, hundreds at a time. Then those pics are shared across social networks and followers see the pics with zero mention of \u2018sponsored content\u2019. A truly organic strategy,\u201d says Cartney McCracken, a Democratic strategist and partner at the firm Control Point Group.\n\n\n\nOf course, Ms Warren can point to more than just a well-run selfie operation for her success. From the get-go, she\u2019s cultivated a remarkably consistent political brand, releasing policy proposal after policy proposal to support a central promise she has made on the campaign: she sees the corruption permeating Washington politics, and she has a plan to fix all the problems that stem from that rot.\n\nThe former teacher-turned-bankruptcy lawyer has a personal story to tell, too. She pulls her audience in with a relatable narrative, one in which she describes her life story \u2013 a success story that has her starting in Oklahoma as the daughter of working-class parents, before making her way through public universities and law school. It\u2019s a story that includes humour, failure and, ultimately, hope.", "description": "Cody Eliff says he waited in the selfie line for over an hour after a recent rally in Iowa City just to spend a few moments with Elizabeth Warren.When the time came, he got more than just a trademark selfie with the surging Democratic candidate after the 2,000 person event.
