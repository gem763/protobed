Joe Armao\n\n\"When are you going to address the concerns your own shareholders are expressing here to the tune of $1.5 billion worth of stock, or is this just going to be ignored and dismissed like everything else at Crown?\u201d he asked.\n\nMr Mayne - who took aim at the board for failing to require Mr Alexander to put himself up for re-election and called for an independent chairman - complained the board was \"barren\" in terms of talking to shareholders.\n\n\"The federal government through [the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity] has announced Operation Angove, public hearings into allegations of corruption in interactions between the Department of Home Affairs and Crown Casino. There are four days of public hearings next week ... you haven't even mentioned it.\"\n\nMr Mayne also questioned whether Mr Packer was receiving special treatment and briefings or \"like me is looking at the ASX announcements for Crown's response to front page after front page of allegations\".\n\nThursday's AGM was notable for the reduced influence of reclusive billionaire Mr Packer and the arrival of new investor Mr Ho, who agreed in May to buy a 20 per cent stake from Mr Packer for $2 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the second half of that transaction remains on hold until a NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority inquiry into the sale is completed.\n\nThe corruption allegations appear to have hit the business hard, with Crown revealing turnover in its VIP program had fallen by 46 per cent between July 1 and October 20. Chief financial officer Ken Barton told the AGM that tough conditions in international markets hadn't helped.\n\nCrown director Andrew Demetriou: Seven per cent of shares voted against his re-election. Joe Armao\n\nHe said the VIP market was \"very volatile\", reminding shareholders that while VIP turnover play had grown 13 per cent in the first months of the 2019 financial year, it finished the six months to December 31, 2018, down 12 per cent.\n\n\"There are some macroeconomic headwinds \u2026 but I think that these businesses are very hard to predict, very hard to measure, over a short period of time,\" Mr Barton said.\n\nHowever, Crown's rival, The Star Entertainment Group, which runs casinos in Sydney, Brisbane and the Gold Coast, suffered no such problems, reporting normalised revenue from VIP play - which removes the impact of luck during any one period - rose between July 1 and October 21, although did not provide numbers.\n\nEvans & Partners analyst Sacha Krien said the difference between the results of the two casino giants showed wealth punters were steering clear of Crown's properties.\n\n\"This highlights the impact of media allegations and regulator investigations, resulting in VIP players and junkets unsurprisingly avoiding Crown's casinos,\" he said in a note to investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'This highlights the impact of media allegations and regulator investigations.' \u2014 Sacha Krien, Evans & Partners analyst\n\nThere were better signs from Crown's domestic business, with main gaming floor revenue, excluding VIP play, climbing 2 per cent in the first few months of the year.\n\nIn a ray of sunshine for the group, Crown Perth reported growth in both gaming and non-gaming revenue, the first signs of growth in eight consecutive half-year periods.\n\nJP Morgan analyst Donald Carducci said the key part of the first half of the 2020 financial year lay ahead.\n\n\"These first 16 weeks of trading are interesting, but the key trading period of note is still to come, specifically Christmas and the increasingly important November, \" he said.\n\n\"We believe expansionary fiscal and monetary policy could have a greater impact on the consumer leading in to the end of the calendar year.\"", "description": "The board's claim that activists are pursuing an anti-Crown agenda comes ahead of next week\u2019s first ever public hearings by a federal law enforcement watchdog.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5458%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_635%2C$y_93/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/936adc8093663b1607c2176c45f7339b5f4275c9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
