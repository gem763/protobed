A coaching change has done much to re-establish the Springboks\u2019 fortitude over the past 18 months.\n\nJohan Erasmus, known as Rassie, is a former South Africa flanker who played at the 1999 World Cup. He took over a broken team in early 2018 and the Erasmus effect was almost instant: A series win over England and a stunning victory over the world champion All Blacks in New Zealand later in the year. South Africa had last won in New Zealand in 2009 and only one team, the British and Irish Lions, had beaten the All Blacks on home soil since.\n\nThe Springboks followed up this year by winning the Rugby Championship for the first time in 10 years, although Erasmus was among the first to note that a curtailed, one-round southern hemisphere tournament means little once the Rugby World Cup kicks off. The Springboks face the enormous challenge of New Zealand in their opening game in Japan.\n\n\u201cThe results and performances up to now will mean nothing once we are in Japan. It is a case of back to square one,\u201d Erasmus said.\n\nHis priorities on taking charge were to fix two things:\n\nFirst, an ineffective defensive system that saw South Africa ripped apart by opponents. Defense specialist Jacques Nienaber, who was part of Erasmus\u2019 staff at Irish club Munster, returned to South Africa with the head coach and has re-organized the defense and rebuilt one of the Springboks\u2019 traditional strengths.\n\nSecond, and not as straightforward, Erasmus had to rebuild morale, which had been shredded by some drastic failures and a ruthless media.\n\nErasmus\u2019 decision to make flanker Siya Kolisi South Africa\u2019s first black test captain appears to have been a masterstroke in that regard.\n\nKolisi\u2019s appointment was hugely popular across South Africa and, crucially, within the squad, where Erasmus overlooked more experienced candidates such as lock Eben Etzebeth, Kolisi\u2019s close friend.\n\nThe Springboks have the elements to be competitive in Japan: An always-strong forward pack with Malcolm Marx, a contender for the best hooker in the world, Etzebeth\u2019s physical presence in the second row, tireless flanker Pieter-Steph du Toit, and experienced No. 8 Duane Vermeulen. There are three playmakers in the backline in scrumhalf Faf de Klerk, flyhalf Handre Pollard and fullback Willie le Roux, and wings Cheslin Kolbe and Makazole Mapimpi have been in try-scoring form.\n\nBut Kolisi\u2019s personal story may give the Springboks something extra, something that can\u2019t be created on a practice field.\n\nThe 28-year-old came from a desperately impoverished background and rose from a township outside the city of Port Elizabeth to what\u2019s considered the pinnacle of South African sport, the Springboks captaincy.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, we didn\u2019t have much to eat so I would often go to sleep on an empty stomach,\u201d Kolisi said. \u201cWhen you get so hungry sometimes you tend to want to go steal and break into people\u2019s houses just so you can eat. But for me, that\u2019s when I went to training. I trained for my school team and then I would go train for my club.\n\n\u201cWhen I put on a jersey (I) remind myself who I\u2019m playing for, everybody who has ever been hungry, everybody who\u2019s ever struggled financially, everybody who has walked to school without shoes on.\u201d\n\nSomewhat fittingly, Kolisi wears No. 6, the number that has such a special place for the Springboks because it was 1995 Rugby World Cup-winning captain Francois Pienaar\u2019s number and famously on the back of the Springboks jersey worn by Nelson Mandela when he watched South Africa beat the All Blacks in that final.\n\nGiven what\u2019s happened the last few years, there\u2019s a feeling this World Cup might be the most important for the destiny of the Springboks since the momentous \u201895 tournament.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rassie Erasmus turned it around for the Springboks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/japan_south_africa_rugby_96825_c0-196-4690-2930_s1770x1032.jpg?84d711dedcd00ed1b0831fe4f19d13be7e5a6298", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
