Maybe you\u2019ve already stocked up on \u2014 and then (ahem) pre-eaten, and then restocked \u2014 your boxes of candy, ready to hand out to the kids tromping up and down neighbourhood streets.\n\nThis year, my kids won\u2019t be among them.\n\nMy high-schooler has self-selected out of trick-or-treating \u2014 he decided last year he was too old and gave up his pillowcase in favour of an evening in front of the Xbox. As for my younger son who is 11, this year, we\u2019re trying something new: we are opting out of the traditional neighbourhood quest for candy and instead heading out to a friend\u2019s cottage with a couple of other families for the evening. There will be a potluck dinner, a bonfire, costumes, jack-o\u2019-lanterns, a scavenger hunt and ghost stories, and some treats: my son has requested some Lindt dark chocolate and a Mars bar, and I\u2019m pleased to oblige.\n\nWe\u2019ll arrive home tired and maybe a bit wired, full and happy \u2014 and without a huge bag of candy to deal with for the next few weeks.\n\nYes, I understand that into every child\u2019s life a little candy will likely fall, and that in moderation it\u2019s not going to do much harm.\n\nWhy are we ditching trick-or-treating? Well, obviously, it\u2019s because I\u2019m a fun-killing helicopter mom who gets way too uptight over a little bit of sugar and hijinks and wants to ruin all the best parts of all the holidays for not only my child but all children, everywhere. (Oh, and also, I\u2019m not here to make life magical for my children. In case you hadn\u2019t heard.)\n\nIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re already thinking, fantastic. You can stop reading here, and I wish you and your kids the best, scariest, Halloween ever, with bags full of as many mini chocolate bars as your heart desires (I\u2019m partial to Kit Kats, myself). Enjoy the buzz, and the neighbourhood kids and maybe the chance to peek inside the living rooms of your neighbours.\n\nBut if, like me, you\u2019ve become increasingly conflicted about All Hallows' Eve, consider that there may just be more than one way to celebrate it.\n\nRecommended Reading: 5 Things to Do with Halloween Candy Besides Eat It\n\nThe plans for our alternative Halloween were hatched on a backpacking trip this past August: me, my younger son, his best friend and his friend\u2019s mom (who is a good friend of mine) spent three nights and four days hiking through the woods, swimming in rivers, making up new lyrics to old songs, Weird-Al-Yankovic-style. Every night, we'd sit around campfires, just talking. One evening, we got talking about Halloween, and the parts of it that we just couldn\u2019t stomach any more.\n\nLike the candy, of course. Yes, I understand that candy will fall into every child's life, and that in moderation it\u2019s not going to do much harm. And I get that the occasional blowout happens. And I also know that Canadians are facing unprecedented levels of type 2 diabetes, childhood and adult obesity and other ailments directly related to how much sugar we consume. It seems hypocritical to, on the one hand, wring our hands about these health concerns and then buy boxes of the stuff to hand out to the neighbourhood kids so that they can gorge on it for the next three weeks, right in time for the Christmas sugar season to begin.\n\nIt seems hypocritical to on the one hand wring our hands about these health concerns and then buy boxes of the stuff to hand out to the neighbourhood kids.\n\nAnd then there are the wrappers. With all the talk in the news about the environmental scourge of plastic, in particular single-use plastic, it recently occurred to me that trick-or-treating \u2014 and those bags upon bags of individually-plastic-wrapped candies \u2014 is a massive source of waste. As I try to reduce the levels of plastic in my life and the amount of waste my household produces, again, it feels hypocritical to not only invite mountains of plastic into my house but also send it out into the world.\n\nRecommended Reading: How to Manage Halloween Treats for Candy-Obsessed Kids\n\nMy son and his friend, for the record, are fully on board. They\u2019re excited about the party, about their costumes, about the treats that will be on hand. For the past couple of years, in any case, neither of them has actually eaten much of their Halloween haul \u2014 both have opted for versions of the Switch Witch strategy, trading in the bulk their candy for cash or movie gift certificates. Which is, I concur, better than having them eat the stuff, but seems, again, hypocritical: why am I encouraging my kid to go out and collect candy that I then encourage him not to eat? And why am I buying candy twice \u2014 first at the store and then via the Switch Witch \u2014 only to literally throw it in the garbage? Yes, I suppose I could give it away, but that just perpetuates the problem. No one actually needs the stuff \u2014 and no one I know actually wants it.\n\nSo, toilet-paper my house if you want, but we\u2019re switch-witching it up. We\u2019re taking what for us are the best parts of the holiday \u2014 friends, costumes, community, spookiness, games, a bit of chocolate \u2014 and ditching the parts that no longer work for our family. We\u2019re going to have a blast \u2014 and I hope that you do, too, however you choose to celebrate.", "description": "We're done with the excess candy and all of those the wrappers that wind up in the landfill.
