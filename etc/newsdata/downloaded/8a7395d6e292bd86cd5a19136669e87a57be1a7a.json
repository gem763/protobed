But the pie-shaped building, wedged almost directly in the heart of downtown, closed in 1979 and quickly fell into decay under city ownership. The entire building was set for demolition in 2013, but instead, and thankfully, as part of the city\u2019s shot at redemption, it became the Element, which opened earlier this year and is our latest selection in our series on exciting new hotels, The New Room with a View.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

But above a certain floor, the cityscape views are unbeatable. And the sheer history and centrality of the hotel makes it an affordable and accessible option in the middle of an urban restoration.\n\nCapping off the Element\u2019s symbolism for a reinvigorated Detroit is The Monarch Club, a trendy club atop the hotel\u2019s 14 stories. The mahogany, marble, and leather-bound interior cocktail bar is surrounded by three outdoor terraces with plenty of patio tables and fire pits. Those features are enough to make the bar a hip and relaxed rooftop hangout. But it\u2019s the northernmost terrace\u2019s breathtaking views, overlooking the city\u2019s entertainment district and massive stadium complexes\u2014including Comerica Park, the gorgeous retro-classic home of the Detroit Tigers\u2014that alone is worth braving the weekend crowd.\n\nThe bar\u2019s hosts work tirelessly to preserve the classy-but-casual vibe, maintaining a clockwork-like efficiency on ferrying reservations up the elevator and into the elegant rooftop space. At one point during my visit, a self-described \u201cInstagram star\u201d burst into the room, demanding to be let in with an entourage despite no reservation. Although this sleekly manicured spot seems tailor-made for snapshot-and-go influencer culture, the staff would have none of it.\n\nThe downtown area surrounding the Element seems to echo this dichotomy between the city\u2019s burgeoning trendiness and its laid-back, no-frills traditional communities. Just a short walk from the hotel are the century-old Lafayette and American Coney Islands, two of the greasiest spoons imaginable\u2014competing directly next door to each other over who can serve a better iteration of the city\u2019s signature hot dog topped with mustard, onions, and chili\u2014juxtaposed with the surrounding area\u2019s New American restaurants and speciality coffee shops.\n\nIndeed, as a city working hard to discover its new, post-collapse identity, Detroit now features many of the hallmarks of other midwestern and southern cities that have undergone major transitions over the past decade: Corporate entertainment complexes and food halls popping up next to often-abandoned or decaying relics of a bygone era; shiny new outposts for digital-era brands like Warby Parker or WeWork; and, of course, a steady stream of pedicab pubs featuring tourists and bachelorette parties shouting along to thumping music as they pedal around with pints in-hand.\n\nBut unlike other rapidly gentrifying, post-recovery metropolises, Detroit\u2019s planners have talked a great deal about a more \u201cinclusive recovery,\u201d one that incorporates\u2014rather than replaces\u2014the city\u2019s historic close-knit communities and its awe-inspiring ethnic and religious diversity.\n\nWith the Element as a conveniently and centrally located hub in the heavily commercial downtown district, I set out to explore the slowly reinvigorated communities that have made Detroit such a unique rebuilding story.\n\nTowering over the Detroit River waterfront, just south of the Element and facing the Canadian city of Windsor, are the famous GM headquarters. While plenty of tourists crane their necks to photograph the famous towers, the most inspiring attraction of the area is the early-aughts project known as the Riverwalk. Five-and-a-half miles of walkway along the water, with plenty of spots for fishing or simply laying out. The path also serves as an artery through a state park and several events concourses. Multiple lanes provide easy passage on foot, inline skating, or bikes. For this trip, and for all my travels around Detroit, I chose a bicycle\u2014a popular choice, it seems, for this wide-open city, aided by a public bikeshare program called MoGo.\n\nThe crown jewel of a biking experience in Detroit is via the Dequindre Cut\u2014a nearly two-mile, below-grade railroad path recently converted into a tranquil greenway with all the old overpass graffiti preserved\u2014which intersects with the RiverWalk. The breezy cut runs through quiet, largely developing new neighborhoods and apartment complexes and brings you to the historic Eastern Market\u2014a sprawling district of shops, restaurants, and one of the largest farmer\u2019s and flowerbed markets in the country.\n\n\u201cUrban farming\u201d has been a constant theme of Detroit\u2019s environmentally conscious reboot, and Eastern Market seems to be the epicenter of it all. An entire day could be spent wandering the market\u2019s five massive sheds\u2014one of which includes a \u201cKid Rock Kitchen Commons,\u201d perhaps a surreal marker of the we\u2019re-all-in-this-togetherness of the city\u2019s recovery\u2014stuffed to the brim with fresh produce. On this particular weekend, a line begins to wrap around one of the sheds as eager visitors wait for homemade pierogies and the fixings.\n\nAnother long line nearby signifies the wait for patrons to sit outside at Bert\u2019s Marketplace, a self-described \u201centertainment complex\u201d featuring live blues and jazz accompanying rows of sizzling ribs and chicken laying on outdoor barbeques and smokers.\n\nTwo miles west of the market\u2014a quick bike ride away\u2014is the Cass Corridor, or Midtown, depending on who you ask. Nestled between abandoned homes or commercial structures are some of the city\u2019s best dives (The Old Miami, Bronx Bar, etc.), an urban sculpture garden overlooking a highway, and new shopping centers featuring hipper outlets like hometown boy Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records catering to the young, college-aged nearby Wayne State crowd.\n\nBut it\u2019s just outside the city\u2019s downtown corridors that you discover the immense diversity. In Hamtramck, an independent city within Detroit\u2019s limits, visitors can find authentic cuisine from some of the more populous U.S. immigrant bases\u2014Japanese and Indian\u2014to the more obscure ones like Bosnian, Yemeni, Polish, and Bangladeshi (including a Detroit-style pizza joint serving pies using the southeast Asian country\u2019s flavors). All of this sandwiched between newly burgeoning cocktail bars and vegan restaurants.\n\nSimilarly, in northwest Detroit, one can find pockets of Jamaican and African communities serving up local comforts; or in a portion of the city known as Mexicantown, one can easily load up on some of the best Mexican and Salvadorian food outside the southwestern U.S. and, within seconds, stumble upon trendy speakeasy-style bars.\n\nBut, of course, no Detroit experience would be complete without taking in what is perhaps its most uniting cultural force: professional sports. On this particular evening, I bought last-minute tickets to see the Detroit Tigers (currently in rebuild mode) play the fellow basement-dwelling Baltimore Orioles.\n\nWhile watching two teams who lost 100+ games this season compete for several hours might seem pointless, it was actually quite moving\u2014especially as a jaded New Yorker, well-acquainted to sold-out ballparks and perennially victorious teams\u2014to view a crowd of just several thousand diehards root for a team in deep dire straits, even as the game went into extra innings and broke the four-hour mark. In the bottom of the 12th, however, with one out and bases loaded, middling first-baseman John Hicks launched a game-winning grand slam into the left-centerfield stands, sending the small crowd briefly into a frenzy.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but wonder how magical it must\u2019ve been to witness it from atop the hotel across the street.", "description": "The entire building was set for demolition in 2013, but instead, as part of the city\u2019s shot at redemption it has been turned into a hotel.", "authors": ["Andrew Kirell", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571444435/191018-Kirell-The-Monarch-Club_f6xfdu", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
