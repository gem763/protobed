(She is, literally, a grandmother of a 5-year-old.) But she wanted to transcend mere rock stardom. She nurtured a passion for 19th-century French poetry. She filled journals in her elegant script. She adored the Declaration of Independence as a child, and copied it over and over. She harbored grand dreams of being a literary writer. Why be great in only one arena? And now this accidental rock legend, in late middle age, has finally achieved what she yearned for all along.\n\nHer latest book, \u201cYear of the Monkey,\u201d published this week, is a collection of reveries \u2014 she concedes to veering more toward fiction with each book. Smith includes some of her ethereal Polaroids, mostly of places and things. This volume follows 2015\u2019s \u201cM Train\u201d and 2010\u2019s \u201cJust Kids,\u201d the latter winning her accolades and the National Book Award, and establishing her as a literary force.\n\nIn her early 20s, the child of a machinist and a waitress moved to New York to box with giants, living at the Chelsea Hotel, hanging out with Allen Ginsberg, Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan \u2014 basically, everyone. She took up with Robert Mapplethorpe, Sam Shepard and Tom Verlaine of the band Television. Still, she says as she smiles, a gate of crooked teeth: \u201cI\u2019m not so bad myself.\u201d\n\nSmith became a rock icon \u2014 truly, there\u2019s no other word \u2014 in 1975, when she torched the music scene with \u201cHorses.\u201d Rolling Stone judged it the 44th greatest album of all time (of 500). Its opening line, a salvo delivered in a guttural keen, \u201cJesus died for somebody\u2019s sins but not mine.\u201d\n\nHer former lover, roommate and partner-in-art Mapplethorpe shot the searing \u201cHorses\u201d cover portrait, when album covers contoured identity. Smith poses insouciantly, in black and white, with a jacket tossed over the shoulder like Sinatra. She looked like no one else, unless you count Keith Richards. Smith resembled a lost Stone.\n\nShe performs like a punk banshee, in a fevered state, fearless, cursing, flailing, falling from the stage in 1977, fracturing several vertebrae and requiring 22 stitches. Every gesture, every image commanding, ignore me at your peril.\n\nSmith speculates that she has may have sold fewer records than any artist inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Her sole hit, \u201cBecause the Night,\u201d co-written with Bruce Springsteen, peaked at 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978. Smith collected her only gold records overseas, where she routinely draws larger crowds than at home.\n\nRock-and-roll, she jokes, is her other gig, the one at night. Her website lists concerts as \u201cjobs.\u201d The books are the opposite of her music and damn-the-torpedoes performances: quiet, inward and elegiac, like the Nobel-worthy authors she pockets in oversize black jackets. Today: W.G. Sebald.\n\nSmith published several volumes of poetry before \u201cJust Kids,\u201d which recounts the early years with Mapplethorpe. \u201cWe had nothing. Robert always worried about me. He asked me to write this book on his deathbed\u201d in 1989 at age 42, while he was suffering from AIDS, she says. \u201cThe responsibility of that book was so intense. I would have never written that book if he hadn\u2019t asked.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Smith was married to the late MC5 musician Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith. He joked about her \u201cfive fields\u201d of interest. She lists \u201cwriting, photography, painting, drawing, music, reading, studying.\u201d Which is, indeed, seven.\n\nShe basically dropped out of music during her 14-year marriage to Smith, raising two children, now in their 30s. She moved from New York to Detroit to be with him and would have taken his last name, she says, had it not already been hers. She still wears her thin gold thread of a wedding band.\n\n\u201cI was heavily criticized,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen I left public life and my so-called career to be a wife and then a mother, as if I had betrayed, you know, some kind of ideology that I never embraced,\u201d she says. \u201cMy art never suffered because I had a husband and children. Having the experiences I had magnified my work, magnified me as a human being.\u201d\n\nAfter her children got older, and Fred died in 1994 at age 46, Smith found more time to write. It took 20 years, and almost as many drafts, to complete the memoir. Surprisingly, she earns more money from writing these days, she says, than the blistering music that made her famous.\n\nSeven years ago, Smith bought her one-room cottage, to write, to create, to be by herself. \u201cSeduced by a piece of abandoned property,\u201d she once wrote. \u201cHow quickly it had charmed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Alamo,\u201d she calls the property, a sanctuary filled with beloved objects and souvenirs placed just so \u2014 a photo of Baudelaire, a desk gifted by Johnny Depp, Jack Kerouac\u2019s beer-soused copy of Saint-John Perse\u2019s \u201cAnabasis.\u201d\n\nShe purchased the property before ever glimpsing the interior, which seems such a Smithian act. \u201cI just knew,\u201d she says.\n\nSmith is great company, prone to laughter, an epic talker, six hours of chatter, generous and warm. Our interview was preceded by days of calls (\u201cHi, hi, hi, it\u2019s Patti\u201d) and emails, and began and ended with enveloping hugs. But she\u2019s also prickly, known to abruptly end interviews when questions displease her. In \u201cJust Kids,\u201d she shares that she gave up a child for adoption when she was 20 but declines to discuss it further. Before our meeting, she cautioned that she didn\u2019t want to talk about her husband, Mapplethorpe and Shepard.\n\nShe talked about them all.\n\nSmith\u2019s life has been soaked with profound loss, which reverberates in her written work. \u201cSam is dead. My brother is dead. My mother is dead. My father is dead. My husband is dead,\u201d she writes in the new book. \u201cYet still I keep thinking that something wonderful is about to happen. Maybe tomorrow.\u201d For all the pain, she says, \u201cmy path has been strewn with magic.\u201d\n\nSickly as a child, whippet thin for most of her life, Smith has a bronchial cough she hasn\u2019t been able to shake for decades. Yet nothing seems to knock her over.\n\nSmith is an artist of inconsistencies. She adores the ocean but cannot swim. She\u2019s an inveterate world traveler who doesn\u2019t drive, burdened with an execrable sense of direction. \u201cMr. Magoo\u201d she calls herself at one point. When lost, she lets fans guide her back to the hotel.\n\nShe\u2019s an ardent fan of detective shows, with cameos in \u201cThe Killing\u201d and \u201cLaw & Order: Criminal Intent,\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t like crimes. I\u2019m not interested in the crimes.\u201d The cottage is decorated with Detective Linden\u2019s Icelandic sweater from \u201cThe Killing\u201d and a metal interrogation chair from \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d signed by Vincent D\u2019Onofrio. \u201cI like the aura of the detective. The detective is very solitary, and on their own thinking things out. Usually, it\u2019s somebody who\u2019s had a rough life themselves,\u201d she says. She compares detectives to poets, \u201ca lot of decoding, so many different angles you can take.\u201d\n\nShe says \u201cI\u2019m a vagabond at heart,\u201d but her prose is more ascetic than her living quarters. The SoHo townhouse is packed with hummocks of clothes and sundry stuff, much of it to be donated to charity. She looks like a vagabond, as though a brush has never touched her hair, which is now a curtain of silver waves. Yet Smith\u2019s a style legend, imitated by many, capable of making four-figure boots look like heirlooms. Ann Demeulemeester outfits her tours. On her right hand, a delicate Cartier diamond ring, a 70th birthday gift.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very social at all. I\u2019m much more comfortable on my own,\u201d she says, while constantly mentioning myriad friends, many of them celebrated. During the interview, her phone blows up. Legendary photographer Robert Frank has died. Of course, she knew him. They did a music video together. REM\u2019s Michael Stipe came to her financial aid after her husband died. The first concert tour after moving back to Manhattan in 1996 was with Dylan.\n\nSmith performed \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s A-Gonna Fall\u201d at Dylan\u2019s Nobel Prize ceremony in 2016, a glorious performance, all the more affecting when she momentarily forgot the lyrics \u2014 \u201cthough I know them backward and forward\u201d \u2014 and asked permission to start over. She says, \u201cmy friend Ralph Fiennes calls that a white-out.\u201d You know, Voldemort. The day after the ceremony, she says, Nobel laureates gathered and asked to take selfies with her.\n\n\u201cYear of the Monkey\u201d is set during that same year, the one when she turned 70, the one when Trump happened, though she doesn\u2019t mention him by name in a book rooted more in art and loss than politics. In person, she doesn\u2019t hold back. \u201cWe\u2019re almost the same age. He\u2019s the worst of our generation,\u201d says Smith, who campaigned for Ralph Nader and penned the populist anthem \u201cPeople Have The Power.\u201d\n\nDespite her political leanings, Smith resists the feminist label. You don\u2019t put Patti in a box. No box would contain her. \u201cI\u2019m a worker. I do my work. I can\u2019t really be pinned down to any specific ideology,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are militant aspects to every single movement. And these militant aspects are something that I try to avoid. Because I\u2019d like to be free and flexible.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more work to be done in her \u201cfive fields.\u201d She plans to write another, more fact-rooted memoir to follow \u201cJust Kids\u201d and also a follow-up to \u201cMonkey,\u201d part of a trilogy.\n\n\u201cI have received both accolades and a lot of criticism for just being myself, right? And I don\u2019t really need the accolades and I just have to, like, shrug off the criticism,\u201d she says during the ride back to Manhattan. \u201cHave I suffered because I was a female in trying to get my work done? Perhaps. But I think I suffered more because of my creative choices, because I wouldn\u2019t compromise.\u201d\n\nThen again, \u201cI\u2019ve never really suffered because, in the end, I\u2019ve done what I wanted, right?\u201d\n\nPatti Smith will appear at Lisner Auditorium Tuesday at 7 p.m.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Year of the Monkey\u2019 Review: Patti Smith looks back at a heartbreaking year", "description": "The godmother of punk became a celebrated author with \u201cJust Kids,\u201d and this week releases her new book \u201cYear of the Monkey.\u201d", "authors": ["Karen Heller", "National General Features Writer For Style"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6QKD22W5VYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
