Fog, rain, rockslides and sheer cliffs are main attractions. The road has likely claimed thousands of lives.\n\nBut for 70-year old Bolivian Mirtha Munoz, the oldest ever competitor in Bolivia\u00b4s 60 km (37 mile) Skyrace, an extreme bike racing competition, it was a natural extension of a passion she picked up years ago.\n\nMunoz took up biking on the advice of her family and a psychologist friend after her son died unexpectedly.\n\n\u201cHe told me ... the bike could help me get through my pain, and to rebuild,\u201d she said.\n\nSaturday\u00b4s race was a pinnacle achievement, no pun intended.\n\n\u201cIt\u00b4s a vertical climb, you go up and up and there\u00b4s no rest,\u201d she told Reuters upon finishing the race.\n\nMunoz, one of the race\u00b4s founders, says she enjoys more low-key bike-riding with her six grandchildren, though admits she hopes the eldest, now approaching 18, will soon follow in her tracks.", "description": "Bolivia\u00b4s \"Death Road\" might seem an odd place for a septuagenarian grandmother on two wheels.", "authors": ["Daniel Ramos", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437556963&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9500L", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
