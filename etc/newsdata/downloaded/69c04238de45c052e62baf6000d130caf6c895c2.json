We\u2019ll be out working and making sure we maintain our sharpness throughout the tournament.\u201d\n\nCole squirmed a little when asked about life under Jones, whose abrasive style has ruffled feathers wherever the Australian has gone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never easy because he sets such high demands,\u201d admitted Cole.\n\n\u201cEddie pushes the team hard but if you want to be successful you\u2019ve got to be pushed hard and the boys have responded to that,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cEddie has won World Cups before and been in World Cup finals. He has the experience and has been there before and done it.\n\n\u201cHe has a plan and he\u2019s never satisfied with what\u2019s happened before \u2014 Eddie brings that ability to make sure everybody is aligned.\u201d\n\nDefence coach John Mitchell also denied that England were concerned about weather disruptions as Typhoon Hagibis nears, also putting this week\u2019s Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka at risk.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Pressure is immense\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t let that kind of noise deter our preparation,\u201d he said about alarmist weather reports.\n\n\u201cWe pride ourselves on being adaptable and flexible for anything that\u2019s thrown at us,\u201d added Mitchell, who confirmed that England are likely to rest Billy Vunipola\u2019s sore ankle until the quarter-finals.\n\n\u201cUltimately if there are factors outside of our control, we\u2019ll find other ways to prepare.\u201d\n\nMitchell brushed off suggestions that England\u2019s 44-8 Six Nations thrashing of France at Twickenham earlier this year would give them a psychological advantage this weekend.\n\n\u201cThat really hasn\u2019t come into our thinking,\u201d said the New Zealander.\n\n\u201cWorld Cup rugby is a totally different beast \u2014 it\u2019s a one-off and has its different pressures. As you can see from some of the big games in this tournament, the pressure is immense.\u201d\n\nEngland, still the only northern hemisphere side to lift the World Cup after Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s extra-time drop goal floored Jones\u2019s Australia in the 2003 final, are unbeaten in Pool C after wins over Tonga (35-3), the United States (45-7) and Argentina (39-10).\n\nBut Cole conceded that the English \u2014 who have minor injury concerns over Joe Marler (back) and Jack Nowell (hamstring) \u2014 have yet to hit top gear.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep the momentum going that we\u2019ve built in the first three games,\u201d said the Leicester prop.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t played our best game of rugby yet \u2014 that\u2019s evident from the first three games, but we\u2019re still building and still getting better.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 England will not suffer from any loss of momentum if this weekend\u2019s Rugby World Cup clash with France is cancelled due to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/f93ba4_prop-dan-cole-typhoon-won-blow-england-world-cup-campaign-off-england-calm-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
