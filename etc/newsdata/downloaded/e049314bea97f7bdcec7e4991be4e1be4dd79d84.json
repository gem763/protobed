As a child, she used to bully Raj by kicking him in the groin, or \u2018samosas\u2019 as according to Raj, and calling him an \u2018untouchable\u2019.\n\nHowever, as adults, it turned out that their parents had arranged their marriage, the main reason being Raj\u2019s mother thought that he should be married at his age and that she and his father wanted grandchildren.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLittle Lalita went on a date with Raj, but it went terribly as a Raj got drunk so he could speak to her and acted obnoxious.\n\nThis changes everything\u2026 (Picture: CBS)\n\nRaj and Howard (Picture: CBS via Getty Images)\n\nOn Reddit, the fan points out that Raj says to Howard in the episode: \u2018Great. Then we\u2019ll get married, I won\u2019t be able to talk to her and we\u2019ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.\u2019\n\nAnd Howard replies: \u2018It worked for my parents.\u2019\n\nWell, we learn later on (in another episode) that Howard\u2019s dad left when he was a child. So it couldn\u2019t have worked for his parents if they haven\u2019t spend the rest of their lives together and are not still married.\n\nOk, so this new information might not be earth shattering but we still think it\u2019s a pretty big plot hole in the best sitcom ever.\n\nWe soon learn that Lalita ditches Raj for Sheldon, who said she looked like a princess from a children\u2019s story he liked which Lalita mistook for flirting.\n\nAt the end of the night, they departed (because Sheldon already had a dentist) and she is never heard from him again.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
