(I) didn't drop a set, played really well, served great. Just overall, a great experience.\n\n\"We had a tough battle in the first set. (In) the second set I stepped it up, started swinging through the ball even better than the first set. Overall, it was a great tournament for him.\"\n\nDjokovic won a whopping 87% of his first service points and fired six aces, never giving Millman a whiff of a break point. He also broke the Australian ranked 79 places below him three times in the match.\n\nMillman was simply no match for Djokovic, who fired 23 winners and also won eight of 12 points at the net.\n\n\"It sounds silly to say but I hope everyone all around the world realises just how good you are,\" Millman, 30, said at the trophy presentation. \"You're an absolute champion and you're the type of person who's going to be remembered forever.\n\n\"Your legacy is continuing to build and will just live on long after you've finished playing but I'm sure you've got a fair few more years left.\"\n\nDjokovic has already qualified for next month's season-ending ATP Finals in London.
