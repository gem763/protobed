LeMahieu said, \u201cif he\u2019s ever going to give it back. I hope he just keeps it.\"\n\nYep, like striking out in his first at-bat against Astros starter Zack Greinke, and then driving in a run every time he stepped to the plate the rest of the game. He had a run-scoring double in the third inning. A homer in the sixth. A two-run single in the seventh. A run-scoring groundout in the ninth.\n\nGleyber Torres drove in five runs for the Yankees in Game 1.

It could be April 1 or it could be Oct. 10. It doesn\u2019t matter. He comes ready to play.\"\n\nYes, a kid so young he even made a gesture rounding the bases during his home run, signalling as if it was time to be fitted again for the belt.\n\n\u201cI love it, man,\u2019\u2019 Judge said. \u201cHe plays with confidence. He plays with fun. He always has a smile on his face. You love seeing that. It pumps me up every single time.\n\n\u201cI want to see him do that every day.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhen he was asked if he were surprised at his accomplishments just one year since becoming legal drinking age, he was almost stunned someone would even ask him such a silly question.\n\n\u201cI mean, not really,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cDuring my career in the minor leagues I prepared really well myself for every situation last year. I take all the experience and now I just put all the experience in my game. Prepare really well to be here and help my team.\"\n\nIt\u2019s as if he was made for Broadway, the bigger the stage, the brighter the lights, it\u2019s Gleyber time.\n\n\u201cSmart, confident, and when you have talent,\u2019\u2019 Yankees manager Aaron Boone says, \u201cthat's a really good combination. He's always had that since he's come to the big leagues, and he just plays the game with kind of a free and easy way and a confidence about his game.\n\n\u201cHe likes playing these situations and he's confident in his ability to produce.\n\n\u201cAnd that leads to a dangerous player.\u2019\u2019\n\nTorres now is 8-for-17 in the postseason with two homers and eight RBI.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Gleyber Day,\u2019\u2019 Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius said. \u201cIt\u2019s been like that. He always comes up clutch for the team. He\u2019s playing like a veteran.\n\n\u201cHis confidence level is always high.\u2019\u2019\n\nCertainly, he symbolizes one of the greatest trades in Yankee history.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs were desperate for a closer in 2016, and traded Torres to the Yankees for All-Star Aroldis Chapman.\n\nChapman delivered the Cubs a World Series championship before returning to the Yankees as a free agent.\n\n\u201cHe comes up every day clutch for the team,\u2019\u2019 Gregorius said. \u201cHe\u2019s just doing his job. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re impressed. We always expect that from him.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd, yes, with full anticipation that he\u2019ll be hanging onto that belt the rest of October.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Gleyber Torres, 22, led the Yankees offense with five RBI and a home run en route to a 7-0 win over the Astros in Game 1 of the ALCS.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
