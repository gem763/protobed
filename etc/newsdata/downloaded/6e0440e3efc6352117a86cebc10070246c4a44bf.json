I sincerely apologize.\"\n\nIn the audio obtained by CNBC, Fisher said at the Tiburon conference: \"Money, sex, those are the two most private things for most people,\" so when trying to win new clients you need to be careful.\n\n\"It's like going up to a girl in a bar \u2026 (inaudible) \u2026going up to a woman in a bar and saying, hey I want to talk about what's in your pants,\" he said.\n\nBraeutigam in the letter said that Michigan's Bureau of Investment decided to fire Fisher Investments after seeing news reports of his remarks.\n\n\"...All were in unanimous agreement that prompt termination is the correct course of action,\" the letter said. \"There is no excuse to not treat everyone with dignity and respect. We have high expectations of our managers (and staff), not just with regards to returns but also in how they exhibit integrity and respect to all individuals.\"", "description": "Fisher was initially defiant amid the backlash in an interview with Bloomberg, in which he said he had \"given a lot of talks, a lot of times, in a lot of places and said stuff like this and never gotten that type of response.\"", "authors": ["Emma Newburger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104384267-IMG_0197.JPG?v=1570804225", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
