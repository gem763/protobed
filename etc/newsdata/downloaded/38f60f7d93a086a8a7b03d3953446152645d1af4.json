On Aug. 30, he was stripped of the industry portfolio, removed as chairman of Aramco on Sept. 2 before being replaced as energy minister on Sept. 8.\n\nBut Prince Abdulaziz, an older half brother of the Crown Prince, is not expected to change the kingdom's oil and OPEC policies, Saudi officials and analysts say.\n\n\"He will focus on enhancing the relationship within OPEC and with non-OPEC producers to strengthen the stability of the international oil market,\u201d a Saudi official told Reuters.\n\nBassam Fattouh, head of Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and a regular attendee of OPEC meetings, said he believed that the prince's appointment represents \"a continuation of existing policy\u201d.\n\n\"The Prince has been a key shaper of Saudi oil and OPEC policy for many years,\" said Fattouh, adding that he has also been a key player in domestic oil policy such as the kingdom's energy pricing reforms, renewables and energy efficiency.\n\nGary Ross, a veteran OPEC watcher and founder of Black Gold Investors, said he first met Prince Abdulaziz in early 1980s.\n\n\u201cThere is no one in the kingdom who knows more about oil than Prince Abdulaziz,\" said Ross who said he believed the new minister will stick to production cuts to maximize revenues for Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cI expect no policy change - the objective is to deliver higher prices and the IPO for Aramco,\u201d said Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects think tank, which closely follows OPEC policies.\n\nSaudi Arabia is preparing Aramco for an initial public offering by 2020-2021, but a high oil price is needed to achieve a $2 trillion valuation figure wanted by the crown prince, the kingdom's de facto ruler and main driver of the IPO.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST ROYAL\n\nThe prince's appointment broke with long-held tradition that saw oil technocrats and non-royals overseeing the energy portfolio in the world's top oil exporter.\n\nSaudi Arabia has had five oil ministers since 1960, and none of them has been a royal.\n\nConventional thinking has been that the ruling Al Saud family has viewed the oil portfolio as so important that giving it to a prince might upset the dynasty\u2019s delicate balance of power and risk making oil policy hostage to princely politicking, Saudi sources and diplomats say.", "description": "Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, King Salman's son and a veteran oil official, who on Sunday was named as new Saudi energy minister, is known in the industry for decades of work helping to foster OPEC production cuts.
