Mallia was through again under the posts eight minutes into the second half.\n\nOn the other hand, the United States were being let down by their set-piece, losing ball at two line-outs in a row, resulting in the sixth Argentina try from Jeronimo De La Fuente, his first in 25 Tests.\n\nThe USA scored two consolation tries by Paul Lasike and an injury-time effort by Scully but never looked like troubling the Pumas, who have never lost to the Eagles in their eight-match history.\n\nReplacement Gonzalo Bertranou put the icing on the Argentina cake with a seventh score after the Pumas had again carved up a defensively questionable US midfield.\n\nThe match ended a disappointing World Cup for the Pumas, who could consider themselves unlucky to suffer a last-minute 23-21 defeat to France in their first match but were let down by indiscipline against England, losing a man to a red card.\n\nAs for the United States, they will be targeting their one \"winnable\" match in Pool C as they take on Tonga on Sunday in an attempt to avoid the wooden spoon from the \"group of death.\"\n\nScorers:\n\nArgentina 47 (19)\n\nTries: Nicolas Sanchez, Joaquin Tuculet (2), Juan Cruz Mallia (2), Jeronimo De La Fuente, Gonzalo Bertranou\n\nConversions: Sanchez (5), Benjamin Urdapilleta\n\nUSA 17 (5)\n\nTries: Blaine Scully, Paul Lasike, Blaine Scully\n\nConversion: AJ MacGinty", "description": "Argentina brought the curtain down on a disappointing 2019 Rugby World Cup with a commanding win over the USA in Kumagaya on Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7123/fbae6118d749475191201833a0af0be6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
