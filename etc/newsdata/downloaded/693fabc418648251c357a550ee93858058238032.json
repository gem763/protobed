It\u2019s not one individual thing that\u2019s driving [these delays],' said Smith according to CNBC.\n\n'It\u2019s us being cautious and thorough with the total systems we need to verify.'\n\nOn Tuesday, the company filed an application with the FCC for 'Flight #12 of the New Shepard space launch booster and capsule,' for which a window doesn't open until November.\n\nNew Shepard, a reusable rocket akin to those being tested and designed by Elon Musk's SpaceX, is being designed as a craft for space tourism and plans to bring up to six passengers to the edge of space.\n\nThere, the passengers would float for 10 minutes in zero gravity and return to Earth.\n\nDespite delays, Bezos' Blue Origin is among the favorites in an upcoming NASA mission to land humans back on the moon in 2024 -- a feat that would mark the first time humans had stepped foot on the lunar surface in almost 50 years.\n\nNew Shepard has launched nearly a dozen times successfully and is making its case to be the first craft capable of bringing domestic passengers to space (File photo)\n\nAlready, Blue Origin has received multiple contracts from NASA to study and design prototypes for landers, propulsion systems, and more last month, some of which would help to enable the use of reusable landers and space mining - a growing fixation by NASA.\n\nThrough NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program, the agency said it will begin to explore the feasibility of robotic rovers and mining technology that could make space mining a reality.\n\nTo do so, it has green-lit two mission concepts this year.\n\nNASA's next moon mission, Artemis, also plans to establish a permanent base on the moon's surface from which mining operations could originate.", "description": "The company said that while it still hopes to launch humans into space via its New Shepard rocket before the end of the year, planned test flights and dwindling time could push the goal back.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/17/15050686-0-image-a-6_1569430667574.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
