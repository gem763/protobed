This dinosaur will be there with the heavyweight champion in Daniel Dubois when he\u2019s (Chisora) well and truly gone,\u2019 Warren told IFLTV.\n\nChisora backtracked after letting rip on Warren (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Both guys (Chisora and David Price) turned down the opportunity to fight Daniel Dubois. One of them loses and it could be the end of their career.\n\n\u2018The future of heavyweight boxing is with the dinosaur. That\u2019s where he\u2019s at.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This dinosaur will be around a little bit longer, so he shouldn\u2019t worry about it. As for the nonsense comments he makes, it is what it is.\n\n\u2018He should really come and kiss my backside for what I\u2019ve done for him in this career. But, that\u2019s another story.\u2019\n\nChisora backtracked on his comments after causing a real stir, admitting Warren did not owe him any money and he held no ill will towards the promoter.\n\nWarren worked Chisora in his two fights with Fury (Picture: Getty)\n\nWarren tried and failed to make a fight between Chisora and Joe Joyce after Joseph Parker was forced to pull out of their October clash with illness.\n\n\u2018His nonsense comments don\u2019t register with me,\u2019 Warren insisted.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re all about. I made an offer to his manager, David Haye, for his man to fight Joyce.\u2019\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt @frankwarren_tv isn\u2019t in my list of debtors, I just like to chat sh*t sometimes \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe pic.twitter.com/xJSfpF3l69 \u2014 Derek Chisora \ud83e\udd4a (@DerekWarChisora) October 11, 2019", "description": "Frank Warren had no time for Derek Chisora's explosive recent swipes at him, insisting the heavyweight should 'kiss his backside' for everything he's done for him in his career.
