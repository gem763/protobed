After he realized she wasn\u2019t breathing, he put her body in a garbage bag and \"threw her into the ... dumpster\" of their apartment complex, according to KOMU 8.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, Columbia police began a painstaking search of the city landfill to try to recover Shultz' remains. The dig covered a 14-acre area as officers worked to identify items that were disposed of around the time Shultz went missing, according to Columbia ABC affiliate KMIZ.\n\nKMIZ\n\n\"We talked the first day of the landfill, and most of us have children,\" Chief Jones said at Wednesday's press conference. \"And none of us, including the city manager, were comfortable with that being the resting place of a child. Somebody's child was there.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, police informed Debra Shultz of their discovery.\n\n\"I'm still in shock. It's like 'Oh my God, my baby will get to come home,\" Shultz said.\n\nComfort is being held in custody on a $1 million bond, according to KMIZ.", "description": "The mother of a Missouri woman who has been missing since 2006 says she's sure that human remains found by police in a landfill Wednesday are that of her daughter.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/megan-schultz-missing-ht-jc-190919_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
