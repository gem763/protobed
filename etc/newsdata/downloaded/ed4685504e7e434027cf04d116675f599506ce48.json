Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nFor close to four months, protests have raged in Hong Kong. During that time, President Trump has been a somewhat inconspicuous bystander. In August, he described the upheaval as \u201ca very tough situation\u201d but praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for acting \u201cvery responsibly\u201d \u2014 no matter the reports of excessive police brutality and Chinese troop buildups along Hong Kong\u2019s border with the mainland.\n\nThe U.S. president, it seemed, didn\u2019t want to complicate his ongoing trade war with Beijing by opening a new front of tensions. Trump\u2019s former top diplomat in Hong Kong even described the protests earlier this summer as a \u201csecond-tier\u201d matter.\n\nBut that\u2019s hardly the view in the rest of Washington. Antipathy toward China marks one of the few sources of bipartisan consensus in the fractious capital. On Tuesday, the plight of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters took center stage at a hearing of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. The panel\u2019s participants \u2014 a selection of notable Hong Kong activists and scholars \u2014 and the lawmakers in attendance stressed their commitment to Hong Kong\u2019s democracy struggle and distaste for Chinese authoritarianism.\n\nHAPPENING NOW: The@CECCgov is holding a hearing on #HongKong.\n\n\n\nWatch live at the link below \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f https://t.co/oSjSDzSKYR pic.twitter.com/evzPNdyyLX \u2014 Rep. Jim McGovern (@RepMcGovern) September 17, 2019\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s leaders must respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy or know that their escalating actions will lead them to face real consequences, not just from the United States but from the free world,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of the co-chairs of the commission and a prominent Beijing critic.\n\nThough the city\u2019s Beijing-backed chief executive, Carrie Lam, ultimately heeded protesters\u2019 calls to withdraw a controversial extradition bill, that has done little to satisfy their broader demands. Hong Kong protesters are furious about the behavior of the city\u2019s police force and, more significantly, determined to halt what they see as an erosion of their long-standing freedoms and democratic aspirations.\n\nAmerican lawmakers echoed that disquiet at the hearing and cast the protest movement at the vanguard of an epochal battle. It\u2019s common to speak of Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model, said Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-N.Y.), but it also highlights \u201cone world, two models\u201d \u2014 that of Hong Kong\u2019s open society, marked by civil liberties and rule of law, and that of China, an authoritarian state whose leadership is perfecting 21st-century methods of surveillance and repression. Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) said China\u2019s rulers may style themselves as \u201ccommunist\u201d but that they \u201care really fascist in behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the unrest in Hong Kong showing no sign of abating despite limited concessions by the city\u2019s government, attention has shifted to what the West can or should do to influence the situation,\u201d wrote my colleague Shibani Mahtani. \u201cProtesters have been lobbying the U.S. government to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which seeks to impose sanctions such as asset freezes and visa bans on those found to be \u2018suppressing basic freedoms\u2019 in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which is pending in the House and Senate, is likely to pass, and Trump has indicated that he will sign it into law. It would call for an annual review of the special relationship between the United States and Hong Kong, which allows a host of trade and business privileges that do not extend to mainland China. This relationship has, in part, enabled Hong Kong to become Asia\u2019s financial capital \u2014 a position that became only more entrenched after Britain\u2019s handover of its former colony to China in 1997.\n\nNow, U.S. officials and Hong Kong activists say further attacks on Hong Kong freedoms \u2014 let alone a feared cross-border incursion from Chinese police or military forces \u2014 ought to bring that special relationship into question.\n\n\u201cBeijing shouldn\u2019t have it both ways, reaping all the economic benefits of Hong Kong\u2019s standing in the world while eradicating our freedoms,\u201d Joshua Wong, a Hong Kong activist and veteran of the 2014 \u201cumbrella revolution\u201d protests, said at the hearing. He added that \u201cour most important demand is genuine structural change in Hong Kong, which means free elections. Our government\u2019s lack of representation lies at the heart of the matter.\u201d\n\n100 days have passed since the first mass march against the now-abandoned extradition bill in June. Since then, 2,414 rounds of tear gas have been fired and 1,453 protesters have been arrested. pic.twitter.com/3EB4A0pIe2 \u2014 SCMP News (@SCMPNews) September 17, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s no sign that Chinese President Xi would ever entertain allowing such political reform. In his years in office, Xi has built a legacy of ruthless power consolidation, purging party foes, squeezing the space for civil society and exporting China\u2019s technologies of control to countries around the world. Under his watch, more than a million Turkic Muslims in the far-west region of Xinjiang have vanished into detention camps. Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy champions see themselves holding the line against an increasingly totalitarian advance.\n\n\u201cThrough the challenges of Hong Kong, the West is waking up to China\u2019s insinuating power in a global scale,\u201d said Denise Ho, another prominent pro-democracy activist at the hearing. \u201cIf Hong Kong falls, it would easily become the springboard for the totalitarian regime of China to push its rules and priorities overseas, utilizing its economic powers to conform others to their communist values, just as they have done with Hong Kong in the past 22 years. The U.S. and its allies have everything to fear if they wish to maintain a world that is free, open and civil.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next is uncertain. The protests will enter a critical period for Beijing. Oct. 1 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the people\u2019s republic, an occasion Xi and his cohort would not want clouded by scenes of chaos in the wealthiest Chinese city.\n\nSunny Cheung, a Hong Kong student leader at the hearing, said he doubted Chinese authorities would, at least in the near term, deploy outside forces or impose emergency law on Hong Kong. Such methods 30 years after the brutal crackdown at Tiananmen Square would \u201cnot be promising for the Beijing government,\u201d he said.\n\nSharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China, invoked a saying by Mao Zedong to sum up the spirit of Hong Kong\u2019s dissenters: \u201cWherever there is suppression, there will be resistance.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
