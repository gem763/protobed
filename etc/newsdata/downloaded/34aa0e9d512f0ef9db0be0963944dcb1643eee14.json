CNBC first reported the cancellations.\n\n\"We were contacted by a delegation of Chinese agriculture officials yesterday morning who said they were visiting Montana next week,\" said Rebecca Colnar, a representative for the Montana Farm Bureau Federation. \"This morning, we received word that they would no longer be visiting Montana but would instead be returning to China sooner than originally planned.\"\n\nTrump administration officials were meeting with their Chinese counterparts in Washington on Friday to lay the framework for future negotiations. Deputy-level talks were ongoing as of 3:15 p.m. ET, the Office of the US Trade Representative said in an email.\n\nThe planned visits to US farmlands had been seen as a gesture of goodwill to the Trump administration, which has sought to pressure China to resume purchases of agricultural products. Earlier on Friday, the Trump administration said it was exempting hundreds of Chinese products from tariffs.\n\nThe reasoning behind the change of plans was not immediately clear. The White House did not respond to an email requesting comment.\n\n\"I have to regrettably tell that according to updated agenda of the Chinese delegation, Vice Minister Han and his team have to return to China earlier than previously planned,\" an official at the Chinese Embassy told the Montana bureau, Colnar said. \"Therefore, they have to make their visit to beautiful Montana in the future.\"\n\nTrump signaled to reporters on Friday that he was not in a rush to complete a trade deal with China. The president has repeatedly said that the more than yearlong dispute could run into 2020 or beyond.\n\n\"I'm not looking for a partial deal,\" Trump said. \"We're looking for the big deal. We've taken it to this level.\"\n\nJust as the two sides were thought to be on the cusp of a deal in May, talks abruptly broke down. Each country has since slapped further tariffs on thousands of the other's products and pledged to target more by the end of the year.\n\nRead more: The Fed cuts rates for 2nd time since financial crisis \u2014 but defies Trump's calls for 'big' stimulus", "description": "Chinese negotiators cut short trade meetings with the US on Friday and canceled plans to visit American farmers next week. \u00a0 The report came as Trump...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/58f0cf7031fdc75b018b4776-2000/rtx34mg4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
