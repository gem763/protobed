REUTERS/Kamil Zihnioglu/Pool\n\nAfter two days of lying-in-state at the Hotel Des Invalides in central Paris, Chirac\u2019s coffin, draped in the French flag, was carried out into the courtyard of the building by 10 members of France\u2019s elite Republican Guard.\n\nA somber-looking President Emmanuel Macron stood over the casket and bowed his head, before it was loaded onto a hearse for the procession to Saint-Sulpice church, where nearly 2,000 family members and dignitaries were gathered for a funeral service.\n\nScores of current and former foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and former U.S. president Bill Clinton, were due in the church to bid farewell to Chirac, who died last week aged 86.\n\nChirac was feted by many French people for asserting the country\u2019s role as a global player and for opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, while a conviction after he left office for misusing public funds did little to tarnish his image.\n\nLater on Monday, Macron will host the visiting leaders at a lunch at the Elysee Palace, though Putin was expected to fly out before the lunch, according to the Elysee Palace.\n\nOther leaders at the funeral included German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker. Prince Edward, youngest son of Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth, also attended.\n\nHEAVY HEART\n\nChirac is to be buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris, in a plot next to his daughter Laurence, who died in 2016.\n\nOver the weekend, thousands of people queued outside the Hotel des Invalides to pay tribute to Chirac. His coffin was on display, draped in the French flag and in front of a large photograph of a smiling Chirac.\n\nChirac was \u201csomeone who had a different idea of his role, of France\u2019s role in the international community, who showed it in difficult situations,\u201d said Paris resident Remu Issons, who was among the crowd at the lying-in.\n\nCrowds gathered too at Paris town hall, where Chirac served for 18 years as mayor. \u201cMy heart is heavy,\u201d said Anne Firmin, who was looking at a display of photographs of Chirac at the height of his political power. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s my whole youth.\u201d\n\nBorn in Paris, Chirac was from his earliest years a member of the French establishment, but he was also known for his charisma and his knack for connecting with ordinary people outside the urban elite.\n\nServing as president from 1995 to 2007, his defiant opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq put him at odds with then-U.S. President George W. Bush, and with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nHe earned the nickname \u201cHoudini\u201d for the way he managed to escape a jail term despite the allegations of misuse of funds that dogged him for years.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nIn the last years of his life, he suffered from neurological problems and was rarely seen in public. He lived quietly with his wife, Bernadette, in a Left Bank apartment, and worked on his memoirs.\n\nFar-right leader Marine Le Pen said Chirac\u2019s family had barred her from attending the funeral. Chirac had faced off against Marine\u2019s father, Jean-Marie, in a runoff in the 2002 presidential election.\n\nIn his last speech before leaving office in 2007, Chirac had warned against the \u201cpoison\u201d of racism, extremism and anti-Semitism.", "description": "A coffin bearing the body of former French president Jacques Chirac, who died last week, received a solemn send-off on Monday from a military honor guard and a band playing Chopin's Funeral March.", "authors": ["Noemie Olive", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435451430&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0C0", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
