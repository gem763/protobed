While Yemen's Iranian-allied Houthi rebels claimed the assault, Saudi Arabia says it was \"unquestionably sponsored by Iran.\"\n\nFor its part, Iran denies being responsible and has warned any retaliatory attack targeting it will result in an \"all-out war.\" That's as it has begun enriching uranium beyond the terms of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from over a year earlier.\n\nRouhani spoke from a riser at the parade in Tehran, with uniformed officers from the country's military and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard beside him. The cleric later watched as goose-stepping soldiers carrying submachine guns and portable missile launchers drove past as part of \"Holy Defense Week,\" which marks the start of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980.\n\nRouhani said Iran was willing to \"extend the hand of friendship and brotherhood\" to Persian Gulf nations and was \"even ready to forgive their past mistakes.\"\n\n\"Those who want to link the region's incidents to the Islamic Republic of Iran are lying like their past lies that have been revealed,\" the president said. \"If they are truthful and really seek security in the region, they must not send weapons, fighter jets, bombs and dangerous arms to the region.\"\n\nRouhani added that the U.S. and Western nations should \"distance\" themselves from the region.\n\n\"Your presence has always been a calamity for this region and the farther you go from our region and our nations, the more security would come for our region,\" he said.", "description": "President Hassan Rouhani separately promised to unveil a regional peace plan at this week's upcoming high-level meetings at the United Nations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105608248-1543941191323gettyimages-1068284830.jpeg?v=1563150820", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
