Some 3 million civilians are trapped there, many living in tents or sleeping under trees, with little hope of escape from the coming onslaught. Last month, children were being killed at a rate of one a day.\n\nThe suffering he witnessed in his hometown inspired rapper Amir \u201cALMUARRI\u201d to take aim at Syria\u2019s warring parties in his song \u201cOn All Fronts\u201d. The track is a blistering attack on every major player in the Syrian war, from Russian president Vladimir Putin and the Syrian government to the jihadi groups that hold sway in Idlib.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

And he is not alone. More than 60 Idlib residents appear alongside him in the video, which was filmed in destroyed towns across the province during August and September. In doing so, all of them put themselves at risk of reprisals from local armed groups and government forces.\n\n\u201cThis is the playground of the Russian leader, where you have to choose between the regime and al-Qaeda,\u201d Amir raps in Arabic in the chorus. \u201cPick their side and you\u2019ll be safe from their rockets. Now see how much talk at Sochi was able to stop it\u201d \u2013 referring to peace talks in the Russian coastal city.\n\nThe video shows Amir rapping in front of bullet-scarred schools and destroyed buildings, alongside ordinary residents. It has been viewed more than 25,000 times in just a week.\n\nAmir\u2019s love of rap began at an early age, before the war. He grew up in Maarat al-Numan, a town that has traditionally been hostile to the extremist groups that have come to dominate the opposition to Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule.\n\nHis generation grew up with the war, and Amir lost many friends along the way.\n\n\u201cSo many young people in Idlib have been detained since the beginning of the revolution. Others have joined the ranks of the regime to fight and others have abandoned their studies to work in a certain industry to be able to sustain themselves. Some have abandoned both school and work and joined the ranks of opposition factions to fight against Assad and Russia,\u201d he tells The Independent.\n\nHe counts among his influences Tupac Shakur, Tech N9ne, Wu-Tang Clan and Ice Cube. He listens to ShiBoBa, Bu Kolthoum, and Anas Arabi Katbi in Arabic.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I like the rhythms and the lyrics, especially those that fit onto a particular beat.\u201d\n\nAmir began rapping a little over a year ago. He bought his a microphone, a laptop and some headphones and started to write his own songs.\n\n\u201cMy debut was really modest when it comes to sound engineering and production. Some of my friends who live abroad taught me some engineering techniques, mainly via the internet,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cMy music mainly delves into political issues but also social questions and dangers. I also sometimes write for the sake of playing with words, meanings and flows.\u201d\n\nWith Idlib threatened by more violence, Amir hopes that his song will reach the ears of those dropping the bombs.\n\n\u201cI hope that the song will reach all the actors who are in control of the security, military and political situation in the northwest, especially those who have the power to halt the attacks targeting us.\u201d", "description": "If it\u2019s true that great music comes from hardship, it should be no surprise that a rapper from one of the deadliest places on earth is making his voice heard.", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/29/15/almuarri.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
