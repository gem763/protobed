The US-China trade war has eroded business confidence, sinking investment and manufacturing.[\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 jobs last month, the government said. August data was revised to show 168,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 130,000 positions.\n\nThe initial August job count was probably held back by a seasonal quirk related to students leaving their summer jobs and returning to school. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 145,000 jobs in September.\n\nRegardless of the continued moderate employment growth and sharp drop in the jobless rate, economists expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at least one more time this year, given the trade policy uncertainty.\n\nWashington announced this week tariffs on aircraft, other industrial products and agricultural products from the European Union as part of a World Trade Organisation penalty award in a long-running aircraft subsidy case. Trade experts expect the EU will impose tariffs on US goods next year over subsidies for Boeing.\n\nThe US central bank cut rates last month after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008, to keep the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, on track. Growth estimates for the third quarter range from as a low as a 1.3 per cent annualised rate to as high as a 1.9 per cent pace. The economy grew at a 2.0 per cent pace in the second quarter, slowing from a 3.1 per cent rate in the January-March period.\n\nSteady job growth last month came despite the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) measure of manufacturing employment tumbling to more than a 3-1/2-year low. In September, the ISM's gauge of services industry employment fell to its lowest reading since February 2014.\n\nSeptember's job gains were below the monthly average of 161,000 this year, but still above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The two-tenths drop in the unemployment rate from 3.7 per cent in August pushed it to its lowest level since December 1969.\n\nDespite the tight labour market, average hourly earnings were unchanged last month after advancing 0.4 per cent in August. In the 12 months through September, wages increased 2.9 per cent after rising 3.2 per cent in the 12 months through August.\n\nThe average workweek held steady at 34.4 hours in September. Hiring is slowing across all sectors, with the exception of government, which is recruiting for the 2020 decennial census.\n\nPrivate payrolls increased by 114,000 jobs in September after rising by 122,000 in August. Manufacturing shed 2,000 jobs last month, the first decline since March, after hiring 2,000 workers in August.\n\nFactory employment growth has slowed from last year's brisk pace. Manufacturing has ironically borne the brunt of the Trump administration's trade war, which the White House has argued is intended to boost the sector. Factories have also been cutting overtime for workers.\n\nGovernment employment increased by 22,000 jobs in September after surging by 46,000 in August.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] US job growth increased moderately in September, with the unemployment rate dropping to near a 50-year low of 3.5 per cent, which could assuage financial market concerns that the slowing economy was on the brink of a recession amid lingering trade tensions. .
