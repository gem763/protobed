Trump is the fourth president in US history to face such an extraordinary investigation.\n\nAt the heart of that inquiry is Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call with Zelenskiy, and whether Trump pressured the Ukraine leader to investigate Joe Biden, the current frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election.\n\nPelosi announces impeachment inquiry into Trump over Ukraine scandal Read more\n\nOn Wednesday morning Trump accused the Democrats of being \u201cfrozen with hatred and fear\u201d, and repeated his claim that he was the victim of a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.\n\nThe White House has indicated it may release details of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint, related to the call, on Thursday. Trump, who has denied wrongdoing, has said the administration will release an unredacted transcript of the 25 July conversation on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the constitution,\u201d Pelosi said as she announced the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday evening. \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nThe speaker\u2019s announcement follows allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of Joe Biden, the former vice-president and the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to compete for the White House in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn an early morning tweet on Wednesday, Trump said: \u201cThere has been no president in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as I have.\u201d\n\nImpeachment: how does it work and what happens next? Read more\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another president. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nTrump has admitted that he discussed Biden on a call with Zelenskiy, but has denied any suggestion of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d, despite reportedly freezing $400m in aid to Ukraine days before speaking with Zelenskiy.\n\nThe White House is currently reviewing a whistleblower\u2019s complaint against President Trump for possible release to Congress, the Associated Press reported. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to release the details of the complaint. Maguire is due to testify on Thursday, his deadline for turning over the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\nIt adds up to a critical couple of days for Trump. He will meet with Zelenskiy at 2.15pm ET on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly on Wednesday, before holding a press conference at 4pm. Trump is likely to be grilled on the substance of his phone call with the Ukraine president and the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Wednesday Trump delivered a bellicose response to the impeachment inquiry, accusing Democrats of \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d.\n\n\u201cSuch an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch-Hunt garbage,\u201d Trump tweeted from New York as he attended the UN general assembly there. \u201cSo bad for our country!\u201d\n\nAfter months of resistance in the face of calls from many fellow Democrats in Washington, Pelosi appeared to have determined that Trump\u2019s alleged conduct and his administration\u2019s refusal to comply with congressional requests for information and testimony had forced the House\u2019s hand, leaving members no choice but to move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nQ&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. With a full house, that requires 218 of the 435 representatives to vote. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the United States then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote against them. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither were removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam\n\nDuring a meeting with the Democratic caucus on Tuesday, Pelosi said that they must \u201cstrike while the iron is hot\u201d as she laid out her case for an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThis is a national security issue,\u201d she said, according to a senior aide in the room. \u201cAnd we cannot let him think that this is a casual thing.\u201d\n\nShe vowed to move ahead \u201cexpeditiously\u201d.\n\nIn her official announcement, Pelosi noted that the chairs of six key House committees already involved in investigating Trump and his administration would make recommendations to the House judiciary committee, which has the authority to handle impeachment. Their reports could help form articles of impeachment brought against the president.\n\nLaunching an impeachment inquiry does not necessarily mean that the House will vote to charge the president with \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d, though that is the likely outcome of such a process. If the House does charge the president, the articles of impeachment would then be sent to the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans who rarely break with Trump.\n\nThe president continued to defend his actions on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNo pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!\u201d There\u2019s no evidence to support Trump\u2019s repeated claim that Biden improperly used his position as vice president to fire a Ukrainian prosecutor to help his son.\n\nBut Pelosi said Trump did not have to explicitly threaten aid to be guilty of an impeachable offense. \u201cThere is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,\u201d she said, adding that the \u201csequence\u201d of events suggested that the president acted improperly.\n\nRepublicans said Pelosi\u2019s announcement was a rhetorical exercise.\n\n\u201cShe cannot unilaterally decide we\u2019re in an impeachment inquiry,\u201d the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said in brief remarks after Pelosi\u2019s address. \u201cWhat she said today made no difference with what\u2019s been going on.\u201d\n\nAdam Schiff, the head of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, said on Tuesday that the whistleblower would like to speak to the panel and had requested guidance on how to do so.\n\nImpeachment is a course of action with few precedents. Only two presidents have ever been impeached \u2013 Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither were convicted by the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned before a vote on impeachment in the full House could be taken.", "description": "Inquiry is over phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and whether Trump pressured Ukraine leader to investigate Joe Biden", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt", "Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b1d041ce3df67936776786f00129a46199e4396/0_92_3674_2204/master/3674.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2202c378ef67e49fa10108b32f25df5b", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
