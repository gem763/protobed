They walked by faith and now we invoke their intercession,\" the tweet said, which at first glance looks fine except the hashtag #Saints with the Fleur-de-lis after it is the official one used by the American football team.\n\nThe tweet went viral, with thousands of football fans reacting to it and many jokingly giving thanks for the blessing.\n\nThe Saints thanked the pontiff for his blessing after their victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nOn Sunday, Pope Francis declared five people saints, including Cardinal John Henry Newman, a leading 19th century Anglican who converted to Catholicism and became one of the most influential Christian figures of modern times.", "description": "Some saints wear halos, others sport helmets.", "authors": ["Cristina Abellan Matamoros"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/02/90/1000x563_cmsv2_88ad6885-7cf1-5df7-a2c9-fbc01e7fdc6e-4230290.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
