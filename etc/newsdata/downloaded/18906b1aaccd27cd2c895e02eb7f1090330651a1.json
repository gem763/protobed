The story, about a sexual assault allegedly committed by Kavanaugh during the 1983-84 school year at Yale, was published Saturday by The New York Times, which was forced to issue a correction to the article the next day.\n\nThe Times revised its report to include a significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question. The Gray Lady also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed and has made no comment \u2014 but the Post apparently had all of this info well before the Times' gaffe.\n\nNYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT\n\n\u201cThe Washington Post last year confirmed that two intermediaries had relayed such a claim to lawmakers and the FBI. The Post did not publish a story in part because the intermediaries declined to identify the alleged witness and because the woman who was said to be involved declined to comment,\u201d the Post reported on Sunday night.\n\nThe Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, \"saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\" The initial Times story resulted in several Democratic presidential candidates calling for Kavanaugh to be impeached despite widespread backlash to the now-revised story.\n\n\u201cSome seized on the fact that the story \u2013 labeled a news analysis \u2013 did not mention that, according to the book, the woman involved in the alleged incident has told friends she does not recall it,\u201d the Post noted in a piece written by Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, Cat Zakrewski and Robert O\u2019Harrow Jr.\n\n'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS\n\nThe Post added that it \u201ccould not independently corroborate the allegation\u201d published by the Times and quoted a Trump advocacy group leader who called it \u201cunsubstantiated hearsay.\u201d\n\nThe update to the Times\u2019 story came only after The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, who reviewed an advance copy of the book, first flagged the article's omission on Twitter \u2014 prompting other commentators to press the issue.\n\nConservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that the Times \u201chas abandoned any pretext of journalistic integrity\u201d and the revised Kavanaugh story is the latest example.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the Times is indistinguishable from dozens of other left-wing blogs. The White House should treat them \u2013 The New York Times \u2013 the same way they would Vox or Slate,\u201d Barron said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "The New York Times is under fire for publishing an allegation of sexual assault against Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh that it was forced to revise on Sunday.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
