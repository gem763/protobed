They then looked for elements that rarely appear in rocks on Earth.\n\nFor example, helium atoms normally have two protons, two neutrons and two electrons but some that are shot out from space are missing a neutron. The presence of these helium isotopes \u2013 as well as the presence of rare metals often found in asteroids \u2013 proves the dust originated from space.\n\nLead author Birger Schmitz from Sweden\u2019s Lund University said: \u201cThe timing appears to be perfect. The extra dust in the atmosphere helps explain the ice age \u2013 by filtering out sunlight, the dust would have caused global cooling.\u201d\n\nAlthough this cooling proved beneficial to life on Earth, fast-paced climate change can be catastrophic.\n\n\u201cIn the global cooling we studied, we\u2019re talking about timescales of millions of years,\u201d Mr Heck said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different from the climate change caused by the meteorite 65 million years ago that killed the dinosaurs, and it\u2019s different from the global warming today \u2013 this global cooling was a gentle nudge. There was less stress.\u201d\n\nMr Heck said it was undeniable the world was experiencing global warming.\n\nIn terms of looking at geoengineering options, he said: \u201cWe need to think about how we can prevent catastrophic consequences, or minimise them. Any idea that\u2019s reasonable should be explored.\u201d", "description": "Dust from a giant asteroid collision in outer space\u00a0caused Earth to freeze over, which triggered a bloom in biodiversity\u00a0466 million years ago, scientist say.
