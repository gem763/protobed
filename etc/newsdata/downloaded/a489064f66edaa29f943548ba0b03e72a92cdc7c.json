Kalin said that Ankara had told the US administration it would not stop the offensive, and would not negotiate with Kurdish forces.\n\nAt one point on Wednesday, the Turkish president suggested he would not even see Pence and Pompeo, but his communications director later confirmed the meeting would go ahead.\n\nErdo\u011fan launched the offensive a week ago to create a 30km-deep buffer zone between Turkey and territory held by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group that Ankara regards as proxies for the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) that has waged a 35-year insurgency against the Turkish state.\n\nPompeo said he would be telling the Turkish president: \u201cHe needs to stop the incursion into Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need them to stand down, we need a ceasefire, at which point we can begin to put this all back together again,\u201d Pompeo told Fox Business Network.\n\nHowever, US efforts to restore some leverage in the region in the wake of the hasty retreat of its troops from the Turkish-Syrian border were dramatically undermined by the president\u2019s comments on Wednesday, during a visit by the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella.\n\n\u201cI view the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be, for the United States, strategically brilliant,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur soldiers are out of there, they\u2019re totally safe.\u201d\n\nThe claim was untrue. There are reported to be hundreds of US troops still in the border area, where they have come under fire from Turkish-backed forces. US commanders were quoted by Fox News as describing their extraction as \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d. The president seemed unaware or in denial of the precarious and volatile situation in the region for US troops and the Kurdish inhabitants.\n\nAs for the Kurds, Trump showed no remorse for abandoning local partners who had lost 11,000 soldiers fighting under US direction against Isis.\n\n\u201cOur soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way, as they shouldn\u2019t be as two countries fight over land. That has nothing to do with us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight. And as I said they\u2019re not angels, they\u2019re not angels.\n\n\u201cWe paid a lot of money for them to fight with us and that\u2019s OK,\u201d the president went on. \u201cThey did well when they fought with us they didn\u2019t do so well when they didn\u2019t fight with us.\u201d\n\nAt one point, the US president declared the Kurdish insurgents in Turkey (the PKK), strongly linked to Kurdish forces in Syria, were \u201cmore of a terrorist threat than Isis\u201d. His remarks closely mirrored Ankara\u2019s talking points, but were starkly at odds with US intelligence and defence assessments which identify Isis as a direct threat to US security.\n\nThe president insisted that the US had no business being in the region.\n\n\u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a lot of sand,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\n\nTrump had no words of criticism for Erdo\u011fan or the Turkish military, despite the fact that the administration imposed sanctions on Monday, aimed at forcing an end to the offensive. Those sanctions have been criticised as toothless by members of Congress, who are preparing their own sanctions package.\n\nThe Republican senator Lindsey Graham, normally a staunch Trump ally said on Twitter: \u201cI firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear this is a complete and utter national security disaster in the making and I hope President Trump will adjust his thinking,\u201d Senator Graham said.\n\nErdo\u011fan\u2019s calamitous Syrian blunder has finally broken his spell over Turkey | Simon Tisdall Read more\n\nPompeo insisted that \u201cthe world has underappreciated the severity of those sanctions and how much impact they will ultimately have on the Turkish economy\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut our goal here isn\u2019t to break the relationship with Turkey. They are a member of Nato. We have important security interests connected to Turkey,\u201d the secretary of state added. \u201cIt is to deny Turkey the capacity to continue to engage in this behaviour.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish campaign against Kurdish fighters has strengthened Moscow\u2019s hand in the region and signalled the diminishinginfluence of the US.\n\nA day after the US withdrew much of its 1,000-strong force in north-eastern Syria, Russian and Syrian soldiers were inside the city of Manbij, with both countries\u2019 flags seen flying from some government buildings and military convoys.\n\nThe Kremlin said it plans to host the Turkish leader in the coming days to discuss hostilities between Turkey and Syria. The Russian military is patrolling between the two countries\u2019 forces to prevent an escalation.\n\nFighting between Kurdish forces and Turkey and its allies continued in the border city of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nTurkey claims it has captured the city, but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Kurdish fighters had launched \u201ca large counter-attack\u201d on Tuesday and reported \u201cfierce combat\u201d in the west of the town as well as in another city, Tel Abyad.\n\nThe French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said on Wednesday that camps where about 11,000 Islamic State fighters were being detained were not currently under threat from the Turkish onslaught.\n\nTurkey also wants to destroy Kurdish hopes of an autonomous state that could serve as a launching pad for attacks in the country, as well as resettle at least 1 million of the Syrian refugees Ankara is hosting.\n\nThe mostly Kurdish SDF partnered with the US in 2015 to clear north-eastern Syria of Isis fighters and successfully liberated Baghuz, the last city under the militant group\u2019s control, earlier this year.", "description": "President\u2019s assertion undercuts US mission to Turkey aimed at urging Erdo\u011fan to halt offensive", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "Michael Safi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aff097567917249189dc5b8c80565e74dd42c65a/0_52_4968_2980/master/4968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=be2c5338a15528d3f4a2b4ca7abf021e", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
