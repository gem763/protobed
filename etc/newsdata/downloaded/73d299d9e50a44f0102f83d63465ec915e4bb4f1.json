The surge impacts will be in addition to those from the drenching rain and howling winds that will slam the region.\n\nKevin Johnson of Georgetown helps place sandbags in front of the Caldwell Banker building on Front Street in downtown Georgetown, South Carolina, on Sept. 4, 2019. More\n\nIn Georgetown, South Carolina, Tom Foose had the sandbags he needed. The Tomlinson's department store manager saved them from hurricane season last year.\n\nFoose, Tomlinson's and Georgetown are under a storm surge warning, which means there is a danger of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline during the next 36 hours. Feet-deep water could rush these streets, possibly flooding the historic homes and shops that define this district.\n\n\"We are going to prepare, pray, and if something happens, we will clean up and start again,\" Foose said as he placed sandbags at the glass storefront.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Dorian was a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph and was 150 miles south of Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nThe surge could approach 3 to 5 feet along the Georgia coast and 5 to 8 feet from the Isle of Palms to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Up to 8 feet of seawater could inundate portions of South Carolina, including near Charleston.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Charleston warned of \"structural damage to buildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\u201d\n\nThe city could see its second-highest flood on record, trailing the city's worst flood from Hurricane Hugo in 1989.\n\nIn North Carolina, from Cape Lookout to Duck, including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds and the Neuse and Pamlico rivers, a surge of 4 to 6 feet is forecast.\n\n\"The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,\" the hurricane center warned.\n\nAccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said, \"Some roads to the barrier islands in the region will be cut off due to high water and powerful winds.\"\n\nThe Georgia and South Carolina coastlines are especially vulnerable to storm surge flooding \u2013 even from a storm that does not make landfall \u2013 because of the shape of the land on and just offshore, as well as the effects of sea-level rise and land subsidence over time, the Capital Weather Gang said.\n\nBrandon Ennis runs away from waves caused by Hurricane Dorian crashing over the jetty of the Jupiter inlet on Sept. 3, 2019, in Jupiter, Fla.
