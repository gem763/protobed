General Assembly\u2019s annual general debate. Opening the debate this year, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro accused the United Nations of participating in \u201cslave labor\u201d for helping Cuba sign contracts with foreign governments for medical services, paid for by taxpayers and paid to the Cuban regime, with very little trickling down to the doctors actually doing the work.\n\n\u201cIt is truly tantamount to slave labor. \u2026 supported by human rights organizations in Brazil and United Nations organizations,\u201d Bolsonaro said, urging the world to reject the communist regime.\n\nThe doctors speaking in New York Thursday accused the Castro regime of stealing the vast majority of their salaries, using them as political agents to promote communism and socialism in their host countries, stealing their identification documents to facilitate a cover-up if they died or disappeared in conflict zones, and hurting their families\u2019 livelihoods for their choice to speak out against the regime.\n\nThe doctors are part of a class-action lawsuit against the government of Brazil and the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), a U.N. subsidiary that acted as an intermediary between Cuba and Brazil to establish the socialist \u201cMais M\u00e9dicos\u201d (\u201cmore doctors\u201d) program.\n\nThe American government is aiding the doctors with political asylum and a platform in which to denounce the abuses against them. The State Department urged the many developing nations with contracts for medical aid from Cuba to cancel the contracts or make them contingent upon the doctors receiving fair payments for their work.\n\nIn Brazil, conservative President Bolsonaro demanded Brazil be allowed to pay the doctors directly without Havana as an intermediary. In response, Cuba canceled the program and forced the doctors on the first available flights back to the island. Many stayed, for which they face a ban on returning to Cuba and seeing their family for at least eight years.\n\nIn Venezuela, the doctors said they were forced to pressure their patients to vote for dictators Hugo Ch\u00e1vez or Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and threaten to withdraw their healthcare services if the patients did not obey them. Cuban state security agents allegedly forced them to keep a tally of which of their patients were socialists and how many participated in the regime\u2019s many fraudulent elections.\n\nIn Bolivia, the doctors who served there said they were largely kept from seeing patients at all. Instead, they invented names and health conditions and wrote up fake prescriptions for people who did not exist, then destroyed the medications.\n\n\u201cThey tell us often in Cuba that education is free, therefore we are their property,\u201d Tatiana Carballo, who served in Belize, Venezuela, and Brazil, said on Thursday. \u201cFrom the moment we graduate, we receive very, very low salaries, then begin medical missions abroad.\u201d\n\nCarballo described Venezuela as the \u201cgraduate school\u201d of the Cuban slave doctor program \u2013 the first stop before the doctors were allowed to operate in freer countries. She noted that was repeatedly told her service was \u201cvoluntary.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder no circumstances \u2013 in Venezuela, Brazil, or Belize \u2013 was this \u2018voluntary\u2019 or \u2018humanitarian\u2019 service,\u201d she emphasized.\n\nThe mission in Venezuela was agonizing, Carballo recalled.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we arrived in Venezuela, we were under a military regime where we were forbidden from leaving the country or having any interactions wtih Venezuelans,\u201d she noted. \u201cThe mission was very hard.\u201d\n\nCuban regime agents \u201chad us under constant harassment and stress,\u201d she added, stating that \u201cthe thing that bothers me the most is that they made us falsify statistics and \u2026 to influence the population politically \u2013 in other words, to force Venezuelans, against their will, to vote for Maduro or Ch\u00e1vez.\u201d\n\nFidel Cruz, who served as a doctor in Venezuela from 2011-2014, corroborated her accusation of pressure to harass Venezuelans to become socialists.\n\n\u201cWe had to tell patients about the positive things the Maduro regime was doing and influence the vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to go door-to-door to incentivize people to vote for Maduro during the last election.\u201d\n\nThe last election occurred in May 2018 and is considered widely fraudulent; over 50 nations around the world, most in Latin America, no longer recognize Maduro as the legitimate president of Venezuela because he rigged the election.\n\nCruz confirmed that he had to blackmail patients with threatening statements like, \u201cI am here tending to you because of Maduro or Ch\u00e1vez, without them we wouldn\u2019t be here, you wouldn\u2019t have healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us doctors in Venezuela had to give our bosses in state security a report over how many patients we took personally to vote and if they voted for Ch\u00e1vez or Maduro,\u201d he added.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 testimony corroborates Bolsonaro\u2019s accusation that the doctors in Brazil were there \u201cto form guerrilla cells\u201d of socialists \u2013 a claim he said did not reflect badly on the doctors, but only on the Cuban regime.\n\nRamona Matos, who served in Bolivia before coming to Brazil, said she personally witnessed the death of \u201cmany doctors\u201d who were not warned of the high altitudes in the Andean country and were given no protective equipment or knowledge on how to maintain healthy oxygen levels in mountainous terrain. Given the dangers of operating there, Matos said, the regime ensured that no doctors had any form of identification on them at any point during their service, making them easy to erase from medical program files.\n\n\u201cWhen we arrived in Bolivia, as we were doing immigration, there was a state security agent there to take away our passports,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were working in bolivia undocumented; we had no document with our name on it, no passport, no piece of paper with our name on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf something happened to us, if someone abducted us, if we died, nobody would know who the person was who died or disappeared,\u201d she concluded.\n\nMatos described widespread fraud in Bolivia\u2019s medical program intended to make the Cuban slave doctor program appear effective.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, you had to write on a piece of paper fake names, fake dates of birth, fake medical conditions, for patients we never saw,\u201d she said. \u201cThese were statistics the agents following and controlling us forced us to write. If we didn\u2019t write that down, we had to go back to Cuba without our salary and we\u2019d lose the money frozen in our accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince we weren\u2019t seeing any real patients, medication wise, we had to correlate the medication prescriptions to these patients who didn\u2019t exist, so we had to destroy medicine to keep up,\u201d she added. Responding later to a question clarifying what she meant by \u201cdestroy,\u201d Matos said, \u201cyou had to burn them, disappear them, however you could get rid of it [the medicine].\u201d\n\nThe destruction of medical humanitarian aid is particularly egregious in an impoverished nation like Bolivia, and given that Cuba claims to be an ally of Venezuela, currently suffering a severe shortage of nearly every medicine on the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) list of those necessary to run a functional healthcare system.\n\nCuba keeps the doctors from having control over their children and actively punishes their families if they defect, the doctors said.\n\nCarballo described how the regime sent her to Cuba, then forced her to send her son back to Cuba every three months to keep him from experiencing life in a free society as a minor.\n\n\u201cThis was mposible because the flights from Cuba to Brazil are very expensive and we had to pay them out of pocket \u2026 I hid my child from state security \u2013 I got tired of the slavery, I got tired of the harassment, I got tired of the abuse,\u201d Carballo said. In retaliation, the Cuban government cancelled her passport. She has since applied for political asylum in Brazil.\n\nRussela Rivero\u2019s two sons are doctors, she explained, and both have suffered professionally because she has spoken out. The younger son, she explained, recently graduated and cannot find work despite the outsized demand for functional healthcare. The older son is being forced to work as an exterminator by the state or face legal sanction.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Cuban slave doctors said the regime forced them to falsify the number of patients they treated and \"destroy\" medicine.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/brazil.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
