The opposition delegation came to the U.N. General Assembly in search of a breakthrough in its eight-month power struggle with Maduro, but is more focused on getting the European Union to sanction Maduro officials with assets stashed in European countries.\n\nThe State Department said it would provide $36 million in humanitarian aid in Venezuela to go toward an underfunded U.N. programme aiming at raising $223 million to serve 2.6 million people. Previous aid efforts within Venezuela have been marked by concerns Maduro would interfere with distribution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving millions and millions of dollars in aid, not that we want to, from the Maduro standpoint, but we have to,\u201d Trump said during a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cPeople are dying, they have no food, they (have) no water, they have no nothing.\u201d\n\nIt is also providing Guaido with $52 million to fund his parallel government\u2019s operations - much of which was diverted from money previously destined for Central American countries, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) director Mark Green said on Wednesday.\n\nVenezuela plunged into a deep political crisis in January when Guaido, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, assumed a rival presidency, arguing Maduro was illegitimate. He has been recognised as president by dozens of countries, including the United States and neighbouring Colombia.\n\nGuaido and his Latin American allies are increasingly seeking to portray Maduro as a threat to regional stability to galvanise countries into stepping up pressure. During his speech to the General Assembly on Wednesday, Colombian President Ivan Duque said he would provide the United Nations with a dossier proving Maduro was harbouring armed Colombian rebels.\n\nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, who is expected to address the assembly on Thursday, called Duque\u2019s speech \u201cshameful.\u201d Maduro calls Guaido a coup-mongering puppet of the United States and retains the support of allies such as Cuba, Russia and China.\n\nPRESSURE ON EUROPE\n\nWashington\u2019s travel ban applied to government officials with the rank of vice minister or above, military members with a rank of colonel or above, and members of a pro-government legislature called the Constituent Assembly.\n\nIt also banned anyone who acts \u201con behalf of or in support of\u201d Maduro and those deriving \u201cfinancial benefit\u201d from the government, and their immediate family members. U.S. officials have previously said such measures were effective because \u201cthese people\u2019s wives can\u2019t shop in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThat move was likely to raise even more pressure on Europe. While the EU has sanctioned several individual members of Maduro\u2019s government, the opposition, the United States and other Latin American countries have called on it to do more.\n\nA group of European and Latin American countries met to discuss Venezuela on the sidelines of the United Nations on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Lima Group of Latin American countries and the European-led International Contact Group said they \u201creaffirmed their unwavering commitment to a return to democracy\u201d in Venezuela during the meeting. The statement did not mention sanctions.\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, the incoming top diplomat for the EU, said during the meeting that the \u201cend of Venezuela\u2019s crisis should result from a peaceful and negotiated path\u201d leading to free elections, according to an EU statement.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday reinforced his support for Venezuelan opposition politician Juan Guaido on Wednesday, praising Latin American leaders who back him, boosting aid funding and barring members of President Nicolas Maduro's government from entering the United States.", "authors": ["Luc Cohen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
