Anne Wojcicki is co-founder and chief executive of the personal genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe, a genetics testing service based in Sunnyvale, Calif.\n\nWhile the ski resort town attracts Hollywood A-listers, Washington elite, and the 1 percent of the 1 percent, Wojcicki was in Aspen for a conference of elite business leaders.\n\nWojcicki, who was just named \u201cThe Pioneer\u201d on Marie Claire\u2019s list of 25 Women Changing the Future, said the meetings had let out when her infant daughter needed to eat. With the sky threatening rain, she ducked into a booth near the first hole of the golf course, where membership is by invitation only and initiation fees and annual dues combined hover near $250,000. No one was around, she said, when she sat down on a bench and began nursing. However, soon after she started, an employee drove up in a golf cart and told her she should breast-feed elsewhere, she said.\n\n[Women share what it's really like to pump breast milk at work]\n\n\u201cThis hut was empty,\u201d Wojcicki remembers thinking. \u201cYou just kicked me out of a chair for no reason. There was no empathy.\u201d\n\nShe relocated across the street to \u201ca pile of rocks on the ground\u201d to continue feeding her daughter.\n\nShe was stunned.\n\n\u201cPeople with small children need help. It\u2019s hard enough when you have small children,\u201d said Wojcicki, who is a single mom to her newborn and shares two other children with her ex-husband, Google co-founder Sergey Brin. \u201cBreast-feeding is an important part of child rearing.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd. I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Maroon Creek Club general manager David Chadbourne, when he was reached for comment about the incident. He said he had been unaware of the incident. \u201cWe have members that breast-feed here all the time.\u201d\n\nHe said Wojcicki\u2019s experience was not \u201ca fair representation of what the club was all about.\u201d He apologized, saying he wished she had told him personally about what had happened, even if part of the purpose of tweeting about the incident, which she did afterward, was because women shouldn\u2019t have to lean on privilege to get the respect they deserve when it comes to feeding their children.\n\nAs a breastfeeding mom, I have to feed my baby in all kinds of less than ideal places. Yesterday at #MaroonCreekClub in Aspen I was sitting on a stool in the check in area feeding my 3mo old when I was kicked out by an employee and moved to the ground outside. \u2014 Anne Wojcicki (@annewoj23) September 22, 2019\n\nWith her hair pulled back in a ponytail and wearing capri leggings and a hoodie, Wojcicki, who is No. 33 on Forbes\u2019s 2019 list of Richest Self-Made Women, admits she \u201cdidn\u2019t look like I was part of a fancy conference, not that it should have mattered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI often live in a little bubble,\u201d where she\u2019s treated well, Wojcicki said in a phone interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s nice to be in a situation to see how people are really being treated. Everyone should be treated well and be made to feel welcome.\u201d\n\nWojcicki also breast-fed at an event with a much higher profile this summer, the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, when her daughter was 5 or 6 weeks old.\n\nShe was powwowing with an older man, she recalled, when she told him, \u201c 'I\u2019m sorry, but I have to feed her.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes, now,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou can go tell your daughters you\u2019re a modern man who had a meeting with a breast-feeding CEO.\u201d\n\nWojcicki said it would never occur to her to try to hide breast-feeding; instead, she wants to help normalize it, including at the 23andMe offices, where there are breast-feeding rooms with desks, pumps, lockers, snacks and phones. There\u2019s also a 1,500-square-foot playroom for kids, for employees whose children have a child-care issue or who have to pop into the office for a shorter visit. There is paid parental leave at 23andMe for all employees, a fertility benefit plan, adoption assistance plan and surrogacy reimbursement program.\n\n\u201cI hate pretending that you\u2019re something you\u2019re not, and a good percentage of my employees have kids,\u201d she said.\n\nHer baby always accompanies her to work.\n\n\u201cPeople de-stress when there\u2019s a small person around,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun and it humanizes me. I\u2019m in a luxurious position where I can do this, and normalizing it is part of how I can help people.\"\n\nTransparency has been among the guiding principles of Wojcicki\u2019s career, because giving people something they can\u2019t see (DNA results) requires a fundamental trust.\n\nThat\u2019s at the crux of what irked her at the Maroon Creek Club: how little she was seen, despite what was right there with her.\n\n\u201cThey were totally unapologetic. It was such an intentional move, and there was absolutely no remorse. I was so shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a world that needs a little more empathy for people. When you are breast-feeding your child, you\u2019re vulnerable, and they took advantage of me. They kicked me while I was down.\u201d\n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to characterize Wojcicki as anything resembling a victim, in this instance or any other.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, I feel fortunate that it happened to me and not someone else because I have a platform to keep driving positive change,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this gives support to other women, then I\u2019m happy to be speaking out.\u201d\n\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates, and join our discussion group here to talk about parenting and work.
