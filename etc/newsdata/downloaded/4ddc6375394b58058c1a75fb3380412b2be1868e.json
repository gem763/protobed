While she was being apprehended on Friday afternoon, Fonda took some time during her Walk of Pride to thank the BAFTAs for giving her the annual Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film \u2014 a scene so amusing that even the cops looked charmed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m not there, but as you may have heard I\u2019ve been getting arrested,\u201d she said, in a prerecorded video. \u201cI decided that I needed to do more, so I moved to D.C. for four months and I\u2019m trying to heighten the sense of urgency there needs to be. Anyway, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not with you tonight, but it\u2019s for a good cause.\u201d Cue the subsequent footage of Fonda yelling \u201cBAFTA, THANK YOU!\u201d and \u201cSTANLEY KUBRICK!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019M VERY HONORED!\u201d before her patrol-car detainment. We really should just fast-forward to next year, when Fonda snags the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Being Taken Into Custody.\n\nRelated", "description": "Jane Fonda was arrested again for protesting climate change this week.
