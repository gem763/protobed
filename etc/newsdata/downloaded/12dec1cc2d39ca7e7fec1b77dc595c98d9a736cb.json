It still needs to be won and won well.\n\nThe Scots hope Wednesday\u2019s Rugby World Cup Pool A encounter with Russia is not much more than a stepping-stone to a decisive pool finale with Japan to decide who will go through to the quarterfinals.\n\nAnything short of a win with a four-try bonus point against the Russians will be a major disappointment and cause major complications for Scotland.\n\nCoach Gregor Townsend thinks Scotland\u2019s reserve players will be good enough to get that done against the Bears of Russia. He made 14 changes to his team after the 34-0 win over Samoa. Significantly, halfback pairing Greig Laidlaw and Finn Russell are rested completely, and captain Stuart McInally is on the bench.\n\nTownsend made the most changes ever between World Cup games for a Scotland team.\n\nThe big moment is clearly the meeting with an unbeaten Japan in Yokohama on Sunday, a short turnaround that makes it difficult for the Scots to pick a full-strength team against Russia even if they wanted to do.\n\nScotland\u2019s still got to get it done in Shizuoka.\n\n\u201cWe have Russia first and if we don\u2019t get the job done against Russia there is no point in even thinking about Japan because we need those five points,\u201d Scotland prop Zander Fagerson said. \u201cEverything is focused on Russia and getting that bonus-point win.\u201d\n\nFagerson thinks he knows what to expect from Russia, who turned up to give Japan a scare in the tournament-opener.\n\n\u201cThey are a very physical team,\u201d Fagerson said. \u201cThey are very well drilled in defense and have a really strong forward pack that try to smash you up physically.\u201d\n\nAfter starting with promise against Japan, Russia wants to finish strong at the World Cup. Russian rugby stands at the end of an era.\n\nCaptain and fullback Vasily Artemyev, a record-holder and a warrior for the Bears for the last decade, will likely play his last World Cup game. Artemyev has started all seven of Russia\u2019s previous Rugby World Cup games. He\u2019ll captain Russia for the 34th time against Scotland and has a Russian record 29 test tries.\n\nHe\u2019s been everywhere with Russia. To World Cups in New Zealand in 2011 and this one in Japan. Also, to the less-celebrated rugby destinations, putting it on the line for his country in Montevideo against Uruguay, in Heidelburg against Germany, and in Botosani against Romania. That\u2019s just this season.\n\n\u201cI need to be realistic. This year, our journey at the World Cup is coming to an end on Wednesday,\u201d Artemyev said. \u201cIt\u2019s very probable that the next World Cup will be held without me as a player.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s never been to a World Cup without him. And Russia\u2019s never won a World Cup game. So expect Russia, spirited anyway at this World Cup, to be extra motivated in its farewell for Artemyev.\n\n\u201cWe would like to make it memorable for our fans, ourselves and the rugby world,\u201d center Dmitry Gerasimov said.\n\nRussia will try to do one thing specifically, it says: Stop the Scots scoring so many tries. Sounds basic, but the Russians have conceded 15 tries in three games in Japan and they want that number to slow down. It\u2019s one target they have for Scotland, even if a win eludes them and Artemyev once more.\n\n\u201cThey (Scotland) need to go for a bonus point against us and we\u2019ve had enough of conceding four and more tries,\u201d Russia flyhalf Ramil Gaisin said.\n\nThe gap in standard between tier one Scotland and tier two Russia is clear. But Russia lost 35-0 to Ireland at this World Cup and Scotland lost 27-3 to the Irish. And on any given day \u2026\n\n\u201cScottish people are not different from everybody else. They are human beings who are fallible when put under pressure. It\u2019s for us just to bring a little bit extra to our game,\u201d said Russia coach Lyn Jones, who is Welsh.\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nScotland: Blair Kinghorn, Tommy Seymour, Duncan Taylor, Pete Horne, Darcy Graham, Adam Hastings, George Horne; Ryan Wilson, Fraser Brown, John Barclay (captain), Ben Toolis, Scott Cummings, Zander Fagerson, George Turner, Gordon Reid.
