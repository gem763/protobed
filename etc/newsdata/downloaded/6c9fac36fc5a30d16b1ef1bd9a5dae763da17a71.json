She is a bestseller in Poland, and has become much better known in the UK since winning the 2018 Booker international prize for her sixth novel, Flights. The Nobel committee\u2019s Anders Olsson said her work, which \u201ccentres on migration and cultural transitions\u201d, was \u201cfull of wit and cunning\u201d.\n\nPicking Handke, who was cited for \u201can influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience\u201d, as 2019\u2019s winner has already provoked controversy. The Kosovan ambassador to the US, Vlora \u00c7itaku, called the decision \u201cscandalous \u2026 a preposterous and shameful decision\u201d.\n\nThe Austrian playwright and novelist, who has Slovene roots on his maternal side, spoke at the 2006 funeral of Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, declaring \u201cI don\u2019t know the truth. But I look. I listen. I feel. I remember. This is why I am here today, close to Yugoslavia, close to Serbia, close to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107.\u201d After widespread criticism, he turned down a nomination for the Heinrich Heine prize before politicians could withdraw it over his political views. His 2014 win of the International Ibsen award was met by protests in Oslo.\n\nPerhaps more gallingly for the Nobel committee, Handke also called for the prize to be wound up in 2014. \u201cThe Nobel prize should finally be abolished,\u201d he told Austrian newspaper Die Presse, adding that though it delivered \u201ca moment of attention, six pages in the newspaper\u201d, he did not admire the choices. Recalling that Handke had called the prize a \u201cfalse canonisation\u201d of literature, the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek said this year\u2019s award \u201cproves that he was right\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is Sweden today,\u201d \u017di\u017eek continued, \u201can apologist of war crimes gets a Nobel prize while the country fully participated in the character assassination of the true hero of our times, Julian Assange. Our reaction should be: not the literature Nobel prize for Handke but the Nobel peace prize for Assange.\u201d\n\nHandke, known particularly for the play \u00dcber die D\u00f6rfer (Walk About the Villages), the novel Die Wiederholung (Repetition), and the screenplay for Wim Wenders\u2019 Wings of Desire, is, according to Olsson, \u201cone of the most influential writers of contemporary fiction, and part of the literary debate since 1966\u201d, who \u201cwith great artistry explores the periphery and unseen places\u201d.\n\nThe committee acknowledged the issues surrounding Handke in their citation for the award, admitting that \u201che has, at times, caused controversy\u201d, but adding that \u201che cannot be considered an engaged writer in the sense of Sartre, and he gives us no political programs\u201d.\n\nThe permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, Mats Malm, said both laureates had been informed of their win. Handke was at home, and Tokarczuk was on a reading tour in Germany and had to pull her car to the side of the road when she received the call.\n\nHandke\u2019s pro-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 stance has seen him condemning \u201ccriminal\u201d Nato intervention in Serbia, and claiming that the Muslims had staged their own massacres in Sarajevo and blamed them on the Serbs.\n\nAccording to Fiammetta Rocco, culture correspondent of the Economist and administrator of the Booker international prize, the two winners should be seen \u201cin context together\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey have obviously very different writing styles but they do write about contested lands, about who owns memory, about the central human need to tell stories,\u201d Rocco said. \u201cOlga Tokarczuk of course is beloved by everybody except the hard Polish right, Peter Handke is not so beloved of everybody, except for the arch followers of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, but still they are both greatly admired for their formal work, for their imagination, for their use of language. There\u2019s more in seeing them together than separately. The more I think about it the more I think it was a very conscious choice to pair these two writers together.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Polish television channel TVN24, Tokarczuk said she believes in the novel as a \u201cdeep way of communication across borders, across languages, across cultures\u201d. She confirmed she had heard that the Polish culture minister Piotr Glinski had never read her books, adding that \u201cthere are readers for whom this can be boring or not fit their temperament. Not everyone needs to read me.\u201d After the award, Glinski congratulated Tokarczuk, and said he will revisit her work.\n\nAt Tokarczuk\u2019s UK publisher, Fitzcarraldo, a small independent press which also published 2015\u2019s Nobel laureate, Svetlana Alexievich, Jacques Testard was about to speak to his printers to rush through reprints of her books Flights and Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead. Tokarczuk had not been published in the UK for some time when he approached her about taking on her work \u2013 he had wanted to find a Polish writer to publish in English in the wake of the Brexit referendum, and the violence against the Polish community that followed in its wake. Tokarczuk, he said, was the clear choice.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s such a special writer \u2013 she has an incredible range,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s also a political activist and dissident, and a figurehead for a more progressive, feminist, environmental politics. She\u2019s a public intellectual and doesn\u2019t shy away from that.\u201d\n\nOlga Tokarczuk: \u2018I was very naive. I thought Poland would be able to discuss the dark areas of our history\u2019 Read more\n\nIn 2014, her Polish publisher had to hire bodyguards to protect her after she outraged right-wing patriots by saying Poland had committed \u201chorrendous acts\u201d of colonisation in the past, leading to her being described as \u201ctargowiczanin\u201d \u2013 an ancient term for traitor.\n\nThe selections of Handke and Tokarczuk follow an unprecedented two years of scandal at the Swedish Academy. Last year\u2019s prize was postponed because of the \u201creduced public confidence\u201d that followed rape accusations made against Jean-Claude Arnault, the French husband of academy member Katarina Frostenson. Frostenson and six other members ended up leaving the Swedish Academy amid bitter rows over how the accusations were handled, and Arnault, who was also accused of leaking the names of laureates, is now in prison for rape.\n\nThe prize is given to, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel: \u201cthe person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.\u201d There have been 116 literature laureates to date \u2013 of whom just 15 are women. English is by far the most common language for Nobel laureates, with 29 winners writing in English, followed by 14 in French, 14 in German, 11 in Spanish and seven in Swedish.\n\nOlsson, who is chair of the Nobel prize in literature committee, admitted earlier this month that: \u201cwe had a more Eurocentric perspective on literature, and now we are looking all over the world.\u201d Olsson also admitted to a \u201cmuch more male-oriented\u201d perspective in the past, which he said was changing.\n\nThe Swedish Academy has long tended to veil the process for choosing its candidates in mystery, with its 18 members elected for life, and nominations of candidates not made public until 50 years have passed. Told to show \u201cgreater openness towards the outside world\u201d by the Nobel Foundation, and charged with restoring its credibility, it now allows members to voluntarily resign, and has appointed seven new members, with Malm taking over from former permanent secretary Sara Danius, who was forced out during the Arnault scandal.", "description": "The Swedish Academy announced laureates for 2018 and 2019, after scandal forced last year\u2019s award to be postponed", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/347782798d6793001850078bd4e12de805f617cf/0_54_2440_1464/master/2440.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e092e6afaecdebf464965bab6bedd6f2", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
