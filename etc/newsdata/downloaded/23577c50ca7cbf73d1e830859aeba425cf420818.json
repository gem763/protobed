Luckily, I was one of the lucky ones and I did come through the other side and I am here to tell my own story. It's important to get the therapy, be nice to yourself. I still wake up, I woke up this morning with a lot of anxiety, just the shock of, 'No, I am not with that person anymore. I am fine.'\n\n'I am building myself and healing myself. I have a lot of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy for my PTSD and anxiety. It's just a working journey that I am going to be always working on.'", "description": "The Spice Girl, 44, and hairdresser Rory McPhee, 31, have reportedly been dating\u00a0on and off for the past two years' and went to a friend's wedding together five weeks ago.", "authors": ["Bryony Jewell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20231148-0-image-a-69_1572137468357.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
