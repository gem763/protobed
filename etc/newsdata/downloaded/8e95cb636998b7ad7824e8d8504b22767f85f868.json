Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me \u2026\u201d\n\nThus recites the poem on the Statue of Liberty\u2019s pedestal. President Donald Trump Donald John TrumpWhite House says Turkey will soon launch Syria operation Trump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report Trump praises Woodward, slams other journalists over 'Face the Nation' segment MORE now seeks to add an asterisk to these lines, insisting that only those with health insurance be allowed in through the \u201cgolden door.\u201d In a proclamation issued on Oct. 4, Trump suspended the entry of \u201caliens who will financially burden the United States health care system.\u201d The proclamation states that an immigrant will be a financial burden \u201cunless the alien will be covered by approved health insurance \u2026 within 30 days of the alien\u2019s entry into the United States,\u201d or has \u201cthe financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.\u201d Lawful permanent residents and certain other categories of visitors are excluded from the scope of the proclamation.\n\nCrucially, relatives of permanent residents and citizens would be covered by the proclamation. The burden of proof is on the visa applicant to show that he or she has adequate health care coverage or the ability to meet foreseeable medical costs. The proclamation lists a number of acceptable kinds of health care coverage \u2014 employer provided health care insurance, unsubsidized coverage, and travel insurance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrue to form, Trump\u2019s proclamation has triggered angry denunciations from immigrant advocacy groups and political opponents. It has been labelled an \u201ceconomic and racist attack,\u201d and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOcasio-Cortez demands authorities 'get to the bottom' of Joshua Brown's murder The 13 House Democrats who back Kavanaugh's impeachment Ocasio-Cortez says woman who suggested 'eating babies' was Trump supporter MORE (D-N.Y.) called it an example of \u201chypocrisy, xenophobia and barbarism\u201d because the U.S. does not \u201coffer guaranteed health care for *its own citizens,* yet wants to demand it from people of other national origins.\u201d\n\nSo, setting aside the politics, is Trump\u2019s action truly racist and barbaric?\n\nThis proclamation would merely put the United States on par with other countries that mandate health care coverage for certain categories of immigrant visa applicants. For example, Australia requires many categories of visa applicants to show evidence of health insurance before granting a visa. The Australian government\u2019s mandate for immigrants to provide evidence of health insurance is based on protecting its citizens from \u201cpublic health and safety risks,\u201d its desire to \u201ccontrol\u201d welfare expenditure on \u201csocial security benefits, allowances and pensions,\u201d and to ensure that citizens and lawful residents get adequate access to \u201cscarce\u201d medical services.\n\nAustralia even mandates robust health checks for many categories of visa applications and denies visas to applicants with ongoing health concerns. Applicants with conditions such as tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C have to sign a \u201chealth undertaking\u201d or be refused a visa.\n\nSimilarly, the United Kingdom mandates certain immigrants to pay a \u201chealth surcharge\u201d prior to being granted a visa. This requirement applies to non-European Economic Area nationals and those seeking entry for work or study, and is in addition to private medical insurance. However, it is notable that the health care surcharge is affordable \u2014 about $439 (\u00a3400) per year for those seeking a work visa, and less for students. Therefore, when considered alongside an excellent National Health Service provision for all residents, the U.K.\u2019s health cover requirement is not a deterrent to immigrants.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther countries, including Ireland and New Zealand, also mandate medical insurance for visa applicants.\n\nSo, if Trump\u2019s move to impose a health insurance requirement is \u201cbarbaric\u201d and \u201cxenophobic,\u201d other progressive countries have gone there before him.\n\nThis is not to say that the proclamation is necessary \u2014 or even desirable. The U.S. immigration system has bigger problems than those created by medical insurance. For starters, Trump\u2019s proclamation applies only to lawful immigrants, those applying for visas at U.S. consulates abroad. The migrant caravans, illegal border crossers, and the millions of illegal immigrants already in the country are not within the pale of the new health insurance requirements.\n\nThe problem with Trump\u2019s proclamation is that it is aimed at the wrong problem. Although the idea may be sensible per se and common to other immigrant-friendly countries such as Australia and the U.K., those countries are distinguished by strong borders. Australia, for example, has extremely severe controls designed to keep illegal migrants out. Faced with the influx of migrants entering by boats, the government unveiled \u201cOperation Sovereign Borders\u201d in 2013 to ruthlessly intercept and turn back illegal arrivals. To begin with, illegal arrivals were trivial by U.S. standards. In such a context, imposing health care insurance requirements makes sense \u2014 they provide a level playing field and mitigate against free-riding by those who have not contributed to the welfare system.\n\nThe problem in the U.S. is vastly different. The horse has already bolted \u2014 the border is porous and there are over 10.5 million illegal immigrants here. Health care is expensive for all but the wealthy. And there is scant evidence that legal migrants free-ride on medical benefits. This proclamation is unlikely to make any dent in the immigration system\u2019s myriad problems. Au contraire, it will impose more burdens on those who follow the law and take the legal route to immigration. It will funnel more money to insurance companies, turn away migrants who bring valuable skills or might generate jobs by establishing the next Google, while doing nothing to prevent illegal immigration.\n\nFinally, it confers overly broad discretion on officials to make determinations about whether applicants possess financial means to meet foreseeable medical issues. Officials without expertise and capabilities will interpret the mandate in highly variable ways. Lawful immigrants will be at the mercy of purely arbitrary action in an application lottery \u2014 undermining the United States\u2019 commitment to equality, due process, fairness and the rule of law.\n\nIn the end, the proclamation is tantamount to shooting at a mosquito when being attacked by a herd of elephants. You may kill the mosquito, but the herd will prevail.\n\nSandeep Gopalan (@DrSGopalan) is vice chancellor and executive vice president of academic affairs at Piedmont International University in North Carolina.
