REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde/File Photo\n\n\u201cAll goods for now are banned from being exported or imported through our land borders and that is to ensure we have total control over what comes in,\u201d Hameed Ali, comptroller-general of the Nigerian Customs Service, told reporters in Abuja on Monday.\n\nAfrica\u2019s largest economy launched a partial border closure in August as part of an effort to thwart smuggling of rice and other goods, and there had been widespread local media reports of a broader closure.\n\nBut Ali\u2019s announcement was the first official confirmation of a total shutdown in trade across Nigeria\u2019s land borders - including goods that had been moving legally.\n\n\u201cWe are strategising on how best the goods can be handled when we eventually get to the point where this operation will relax for the influx of goods,\u201d he said. He did not give a timeline for any relaxation of the controls.\n\nThe closure has no impact on Nigeria\u2019s economically crucial oil exports, which are shipped out almost entirely via the nation\u2019s seaports and offshore oil platforms.\n\nAli added that despite the land border closure, it would still be possible for goods to cross at points equipped with special scanners, but did not say where those locations were.\n\nAli said reopening the borders would depend on the actions of neighbouring states, and that as long as they and Nigeria were not in accord on what goods should be imported or exported overland, the frontier would remain shut.\n\nThe move is likely to make a variety of food items, such as rice, tomatoes, poultry and sugar, more expensive for consumers. While it was illegal to bring these items into the country via land borders even before the border closure, they had been widely smuggled.\n\n\u201cAlready we are seeing effects on prices and inflation and I\u2019m guessing we will see effects on Q3 GDP once that data comes out in November,\u201d said Nonso Obikili, director at the Turgot Centre for Economics and Policy Research in Abuja.\n\nExports are also restricted, which will stop movements of cocoa and sesame seeds via land borders, Obikili said.\n\nAli noted that legal exports could continue via seaports, but Nigeria\u2019s congested terminals and dilapidated road and rail networks make it difficult to quickly change export routes.\n\nDeliveries of gasoline in Nigeria had also dropped by nearly 20 percent during the early stage of the border closure, according to the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency.\n\nGasoline, whose prices is capped in Nigeria, is frequently smuggled across land borders and sold in neighbouring countries.", "description": "Nigeria has closed its land borders to all movement of goods and has no timeline for reopening them, the head of the nation's customs agency said, as part of an effort to curb smuggling.", "authors": ["Abraham Achirga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441389258&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0HF-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
