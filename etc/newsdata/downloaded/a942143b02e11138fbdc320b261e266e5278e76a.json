Both she and her sister had their ramps folded and they sailed to the James Watt Dock on the Clyde. A crowd of locals watched on in silence, the end of an era unfolding before their eyes.\n\n\u2018The last ferry, it was very sad\u2019, local B & B owner Celia Munro says in the programme.\n\nArchive footage shows people young and old wrapped up in raincoats as in horizontal rain, they watch their old friend depart.\n\nLocal journalist David Ross remembers the atmosphere on the dock.\n\n\"Silence. Just a lot of the local people were quite quiet I felt. That was my impression that they knew their island was changing forever.\"", "description": "Locals recount the day they said goodbye to an old friend ahead of a fierce battle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07qsx5g.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
