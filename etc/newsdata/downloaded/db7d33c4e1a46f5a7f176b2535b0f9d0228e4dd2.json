The two labs will not lock in customers on an exclusive basis in any new contracts or existing contracts that are renewed, extended or rolled over after March 4.\n\nPAH will also allow early termination of contracts without cause, subject to a prior written notice period.\n\nThis will enable customers to switch to other labs more easily, which is meant to encourage competing labs to offer a larger volume of tests and/or range of tests in order to increase competitive constraint on the merged entity over time.\n\nLastly, the merged entity will maintain its prices for two types of customers: private hospitals which do not operate their own in-house labs, as well as health-screening companies.\n\nPAH is to individually notify all customers affected by the commitments, conduct an internal audit annually, and submit signed yearly compliance statements to CCCS.\n\nIf the watchdog has reasonable grounds for suspecting non-compliance with any of the final commitments, PAH will appoint a monitoring trustee to monitor the two labs\u2019 compliance.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - THE Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) has granted conditional approval for the completed merger of two private clinical laboratories, after accepting four-year commitments from Pathology Asia Holdings (PAH). .
