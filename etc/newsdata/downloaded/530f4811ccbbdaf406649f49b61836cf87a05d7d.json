Bernie Sanders continued to sell his Medicare for All healthcare plan on the basis of cost-saving. \u201cEvery study done shows that \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 is the most cost-effective approach for providing health care to every man woman and child in this country,\u201d Sanders bellowed from the stage at Texas Southern University.\n\nIn the past, Sen. Sanders and advocates for single-payer healthcare have specifically claimed that \u201cMedicare for All\u201d would save the country billions of dollars by eliminating wasteful administrative costs. But right now, Medicare\u2019s rampant fraud and waste complicates this. In fact, it should serve as a warning to those who would expand the program to cover the entire country.\n\nAdministrative spending is a lousy way to measure efficiency, which is why fact checkers have disputed these numbers in the past. But focusing on administration ignores a fundamental truth about Medicare. If Medicare spends less on administration, it\u2019s not because the program is efficient, it\u2019s because those who oversee the program don\u2019t have the capacity to properly examine each claim. In their 2018 book, Overcharged, Cato Institute scholars Charles Silver and David Hyman demonstrate how Medicare\u2019s nets fail to catch fraudsters.\n\nHealthcare providers often take advantage of Medicare by lying or exaggerating about their patients\u2019 conditions. Take, for example, a practice little-known outside the medical community called \u201cupcoding,\u201d in which providers wrongly bill Medicare to receive higher payments. Silver and Hyman write that from 2008 to 2010, the Chino Valley Medical Center in California claimed 35.2% of its patients had acute heart failure as a secondary condition \u2014 a rate that was 15 times the state average. Further investigation revealed the hospital had actually upcoded to receive bonus payments, which could amount to as much as $6,000 for each patient with acute heart failure as a secondary condition. This practice isn\u2019t unique to California \u2014 Silver and Hyman also reference a study conducted by Christopher S. Brunt in Health Economics that reports 15% of what Medicare pays for general office visits can be attributed to upcoding.\n\nSilver and Hyman give plenty more examples of providers lying to Medicare. They cited a Bloomberg article that reported on a horrifying trend in the '90s. During that time, doctors performed chemical castration \u2014 a treatment reserved for prostate cancer \u2014 on hundreds of thousands of male patients who didn\u2019t need it, all because Medicare\u2019s reimbursements were so high. The authors also recount how pharmacists often report paying higher prices for drugs so they can get higher Medicare reimbursements. The practice is so common, industry-insiders have joked that AWP, which stands for drugs\u2019 \u201caverage wholesale price\u201d that providers are supposed to report to Medicare, actually means \u201cain\u2019t what\u2019s paid.\u201d\n\nProviders commit fraud every day because they can. After all, as Silver and Hyman point out, \u201cMedicare relies on hospitals to bill honestly.\u201d If they don\u2019t, it\u2019s likely no one will find out. The Overcharged authors elucidate the problem well by noting it would \u201crequire 125,000 people each working 2,000 hours a year\u201d to examine Medicare and Medicaid\u2019s three billion claims for five minutes each. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough time to find and flag a fraud, much less to investigate one.\u201d\n\nInstead of solving the problem, transitioning to a single-payer system would make it worse. A single national system in a country as large as the United States would be astronomically harder to manage. Medicare would have to adopt rationing strategies like the United Kingdom\u2019s single-payer National Health System (NHS), which recently put thousands of elderly patients at risk of going blind by limiting their access to cataract treatment \u2014 all in an effort to save money.\n\nIt\u2019s true that health insurance markets are inefficient. But Silver and Hyman emphasize the main driver of America\u2019s healthcare costs is public policy that incentivizes third-party payments and overinsurance. Insurance coverage spread after the government exempted employer-sponsored health insurance from taxes in 1954. And more insurance meant higher costs. MIT Economist Amy Finkelstein is referenced in Overcharged estimating that \u201cinsurance was responsible for about half of the six-fold increase in health care spending per capita that occurred from 1950 to 1990.\u201d\n\nEven if the healthcare sector\u2019s many regulations and inefficiencies are acknowledged, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d advocates are wrong to use administrative rates to portray Medicare as more efficient than private insurance. Whatever options lawmakers consider to improve our healthcare system, scaling Medicare for the entire country certainly shouldn\u2019t be one of them.\n\nChris Medrano is a writer and researcher in Arlington, VA and a contributor to Young Voices.
