His name was redacted from the warrant.\n\n\"Jefferson raised her handgun, pointed it toward the window, then Jefferson was shot and fell to the ground,\" the warrant said.\n\nDean's partner, identified as Officer Darch, said she could see Jefferson when Dean shot her.\n\n\"She could only see Jefferson's face through the window when Officer Dean discharged his weapon,\" the warrant said.\n\nThe officers did not knock on the front door of the home or announce they were police before Dean fired his weapon, according to Kraus.\n\n\"It makes sense she would have a gun if she felt threatened or if there was someone in the backyard,\" Kraus said, ending a press conference after eight minutes as he grew emotional talking about the impact of the killing on police morale.\n\nFort Worth has called in an independent panel of experts to evaluate the police department after the shooting.\n\nJefferson was killed the same month another former Texas police officer, Amber Guyger, was convicted of murdering Botham Jean, a black man, as he sat in his home eating ice cream.\n\nJefferson's family has called for the swift prosecution of Dean, who was arrested on Monday and posted bond overnight. \"#AtatianaJefferson deserved to live in a world where she was safe from brutality playing video games in her home with her nephew,\" Merritt tweeted.
