And to watch your \u201csister\u201d die, and to willingly kill your own character you\u2019ve played for 10 years and you love, is a weird dilemma to be in, because you have to do the filming\u2026\"\n\n(Image: Mike Marsland/WireImage)\n\nRita walked in Roxy's stilettos for 10 years from 2007 until 2017 when her character was killed off.\n\nThe BBC offered an alternative version for fans which saw sister Ronnie survive and find Roxy's corpse on a pool table in a clip seen on the official Snapchat account.\n\n(Image: BBC ONE)\n\nDespite having filmed with the soap for 10 years, the actress admitted her death sequence was the \"weirdest thing\" she has ever seen.\n\nRita shared the great lengths she went to while shooting the dark scenes for the soap.\n\nShe added: \"We laid in the pool for four hours with floats on our backs, there were divers arranging our dresses, and eventually that crane shot you saw came in and it just pans out.\n\n\"We both watched it when it aired, it was one of the weirdest things I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\"What people don\u2019t get is how much you invest yourself into the character you\u2019re playing.\"", "description": "Rita admitted she was devastated when her character Roxy was killed off as she had played her on-screen for a decade", "authors": ["Lily Waddell", "Image", "Mike Marsland Wireimage", "Bbc One"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20745217.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Pride-Of-Britain-Awards-2019-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
