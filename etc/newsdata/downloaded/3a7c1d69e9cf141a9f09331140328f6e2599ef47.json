His goal to hit as many of the company's 30,000 locations as possible is all part of a project he calls \"Starbucks Everywhere.\"\n\n\"This project does get quite tedious,\" said the 47-year-old, who told Business Insider that his career as a contract computer programmer gives him the freedom to travel across the world for his hobby, which he calls \"Starbucking.\" To make each visit \"count,\" Winter usually orders a small sample size of coffee in each store, downs it, and then snaps a picture for his website.\n\nRead more: A 27-year-old Costco fan loves the store so much he got a logo tattooed and had a birthday party in the food court\n\nTo date, Winter has traversed four continents in search of Starbucks locations. Needless to say, that's a lot of coffee-drinking for someone who doesn't even like the taste of Starbucks \u2014 Winter said he's never even tried the company's famed Pumpkin Spice Latte.

Since then, he's developed a more advanced system to keep track of his visits, which involves recording trips with photos and assigning numbers to correspond to the stores.\n\nHis hunt has taken him to stores in South Korea, Japan, and Qatar and even nabbed him a backstage pass to meet rock band Vampire Weekend at Madison Square Garden, after one of the band members heard about his extreme hobby.\n\nWinter in a location in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
