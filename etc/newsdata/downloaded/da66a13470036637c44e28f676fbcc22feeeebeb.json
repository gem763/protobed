But it's rarely just about sex.\n\nIt seems crazy to think the subtle vibration of a smartwatch would be powerful enough to end a marriage.\n\nBut as *Bill grabbed his wife *Ruby\u2019s watch from the charger, that was exactly what was about to happen.\n\nYou might be sceptical that a simple message alert could carry quite that much power \u2013 but it makes perfect sense.\n\nAfter all, a relationship never falls apart in the dramatic way that you would imagine.\n\nInstead, it shatters because of one tiny moment which finally confirms the truth.\n\nAs Bill shared on Reddit, it would only take one piece of evidence to validate his months of doubt and fear about Ruby's faithfulness.\n\nWant to join the family?

Source: iStock\n\n\"It was the longest night of my life\"\n\nAs Bill looked down at the message on the tiny screen, he knew instantly that it was from Ruby\u2019s secret boyfriend.\n\nIt was the proof he had been looking for.\n\nBut now that he finally had it, Bill had no idea what to do with it.\n\n\u201cI did not sleep a wink all night or all of the next morning... or into the afternoon,\u201d Bill said.\n\n\"It was the longest night of my life. I wanted to end this marriage of 13 years right there and then.\u201d\n\n\"Would a divorce send him over the edge?\u201d\n\nThe only thing stopping Bill from walking out the door right there and then was the thought of their three kids, who are all under 10.\n\nHe was especially worried about their son, who has an anxiety disorder - as well as several other neurological issues.\n\n\u201cWould a divorce send him over the edge?\u201dBill worried.\n\n\u201cHis anxiety has improved with many hours of therapy - but I live in fear of a return to his days of debilitating anxiety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next bit really took me by surprise\"\n\nIn the end, Bill decided that he needed to gather some more evidence before he made a decision... so he got to work and started digging.\n\nThe message on the watch had shown the man\u2019s name - but Bill needed more information than that.\n\nSo he started combing through their family phone plan, looking for numbers that stood out.\n\n\u201cNext stop, reverse phone lookup on whitepages.com,\u201d Bill explained.\n\n\u201cI punched in the first of the numbers and guess what, the initials that came up were right. I got lucky the first time.\n\n\u201cThe next bit took me by surprise.\u201d\n\n\"I recognised it straightaway\"\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the man\u2019s name that was familiar to Bill \u2013 he also recognised his address.\n\nHe lived in the home Bill and Ruby had lived when the first got married and started a family.\n\n\u201cWe used to live there, we used to own that house,\u201d Bill said.\n\n\u201cI had sold him that house more than six years ago.\n\n\u201cThe next few days involved more sleuthing and to make a long story short, the best I can surmise, she is an avid runner and she is a member of a running club.\n\n\u201cLooks like he joined the same running club circa May. The affair started after that.\u201d\n\n\"I still don\u2019t know what to do\"\n\nIt's now been several months since Bill learned the truth and he still hasn\u2019t left Ruby.\n\nHe still paralysed with crippling indecision - torn between the desire to leave and the need to stay.\n\n\u201cSome days it hurts more than I can take and I toy around with asking my kids' forgiveness and file for divorce,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOther days, I try to remind myself that I love them more than I hate her.\n\n\u201cThe part about starting a new life is preying on my mind too. I am 44. Can I really delay leaving?\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n*Names have been changed", "description": "\"I wanted to end this marriage of 13 years right there and then.\u201d", "authors": ["Madeline Cox"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/6e5404cf0bf221e02384932564cdc48a", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
