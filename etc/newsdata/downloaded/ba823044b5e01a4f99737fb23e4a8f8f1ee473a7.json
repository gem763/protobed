With gardening, simply focusing on the task in hand, be it weeding, pruning or planting, can have an astoundingly positive effect on your mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Ninety per cent of us say we feel better just by being around plants and evidence continues to stack up around the positive impact of gardening and having access to green space has on our mental health.\u2019\n\nPlants like Aloe Vera, Bamboo and Devil\u2019s Ivy can all do well in low-light and/or low-water environments, which makes them ideal for an office or home.\n\nFor more XX\n\nMORE: Plant-themed baby names are a major trend right now\n\nMORE: Ever fancied growing your own d*ck plant?
