It owns fashion names such as Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer.\n\nIt would also give LVMH a much broader foothold in the United States and broaden its offerings in jewelry.\n\nLVMH cautioned in a brief statement that \"there can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement.\"\n\nTiffany said the offer was for $120 a share, which is about $14.5 billion. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the offer over the weekend.\n\nThe New York-based company said Monday that it was considering the offer. Its shares jumped 31% to $128.81 in premarket trading in New York.\n\nThe offer comes as Tiffany has struggled with stagnating sales as China's slowing economy has weighed on spending by Chinese tourists, who make up a substantial portion of luxury spending. The strong dollar has also made Tiffany products more expensive for consumers outside the U.S.\n\nLVMH competes with the Kering Group, which owns Gucci and Saint Laurent, and Richemont SA, which owns Cartier.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
