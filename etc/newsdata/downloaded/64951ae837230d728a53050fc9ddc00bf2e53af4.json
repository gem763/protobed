The Taliban claimed responsibility for all the attacks.\n\nIn all, 17 U.S. troops have been killed and more than 100 wounded, some of them severely. One of them -- a special operations soldier -- lost his right arm and leg last month after a grenade exploded during close-quarters combat.\n\nThree military aircraft, 18 medical personnel, 24,000 gallons of fuel and 26 gallons of blood were spent to save the life of this critically wounded soldier, whom Fox News agreed not to identify at the request of the U.S. military.\n\nOfficials credit a recent decision to have assault forces carry blood on the battlefield, as well as and lifesaving surgery at Bagram Airbase.\n\nMore than 100 troops stood in line outside the base hospital to donate blood to help their wounded brother-in-arms. Then the Air Force sprang into action to bring him home.\n\nA C-17 flight crew based at Dover Air Force Base flew from Germany to Afghanistan on short notice, then made the 8,000-mile non-stop journey to Texas.\n\nRETIRED SEAL MCRAVEN SAYS US WILL BE IN AFGHANISTAN FOR 'VERY LONG TIME'\n\n\"The crew members that were on board, we kind of know what was at stake should anything fall out of line,\" said Maj. Dan Kudlacz, the aircraft commander for the mission dubbed REACH 797. \"I know I didn't really get great sleep the night prior just because I knew what was at stake.\"\n\nThe mission required two night time mid-air refuelings, one over Europe and the other over Maine. For Kudlacz, it was the first time this type of mission had been attempted in his career.\n\n\"To do it with air medical evacuation patients on board was definitely something that I have never heard of,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThere was quite a bit of critical urgency to this,\u201d said Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Hathaway, the C-17 loadmaster. \u201cYou could hear in their voice the stress of the pilots when they were calculating the fuel.\u201d\n\nC-17 crew chief Staff Sgt. Terrance Williamson said there was no question the flight was a high priority.\n\n\u201cWe knew like we had to get this done,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cWe could make this almost impossible mission happen.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNineteen hours after taking off from Afghanistan, the C-17 landed in San Antonio to transport the soldier to Brooke Army Medical Center. The Air Force flight crew had completed their mission without breaking the sacred oath among U.S. forces in combat.\n\n\u201cYou can expect that we, being the United States military, are going to do everything that we can in our power and we are going to spare no expense to bring you home,\u201d Kudlacz said.\n\nThe soldier was still in critical condition Friday night.\n\nFox News\u2019s Ben Florance and Mary Beth Hughes contributed to this report", "description": "Three military aircraft, 18 medical personnel, 24,000 gallons of fuel\u00a0and 26 gallons of blood were\u00a0spent to save the life of this critically wounded\u00a0soldier.", "authors": ["Lucas Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/c5942644-US-troops-Afghanistan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
