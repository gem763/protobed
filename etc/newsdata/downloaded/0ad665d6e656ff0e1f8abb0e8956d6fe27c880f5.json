But my British friends said to me: \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s great. But you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life,\u2019\u201d she told the interviewer, Tom Bradby, in the film, broadcast on Sunday.\n\nPrince Harry: 'My mother's death is wound that festers' Read more\n\nShe said she had \u201cvery naively\u201d told her friends: \u201cWhat are you talking about. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019m not in the tabloids.\u201d She added: \u201cI didn\u2019t get it. So, it\u2019s been complicated.\u201d\n\nMeghan was speaking during the couple\u2019s recent tour of southern Africa, during which it was announced she was suing the Mail on Sunday over an allegation that it unlawfully published a private letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle.\n\nAt the same time Harry issued a ferocious attack on the British tabloids, accusing them of a \u201cruthless\u201d campaign against Meghan. Harry also issued legal proceedings against the owners of the Sun and the Daily Mirror over alleged phone hacking.\n\nHe told Bradby he would not be bullied by sections of the media \u201cinto playing a game that killed my mum\u201d.\n\nMeghan appeared close to tears as she spoke of coping with the pressure, particularly after the birth of their first child, Archie. \u201cIt\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe biggest thing that I know is that I never thought it would be easy, but I thought it would be fair. And that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really hard to reconcile.\u201d\n\nAsked if she could cope with the pressure, she said: \u201cI have said for a long time to H \u2013 that\u2019s what I call him \u2013 it\u2019s not enough just to survive something, right? That\u2019s not the point of life. You\u2019ve got to thrive. You\u2019ve got to feel happy.\u201d\n\nShe said she had \u201creally tried\u201d to adopt the \u201cBritish sensibility of stiff upper lip\u201d but thought that \u201cwhat that does internally is probably damaging\u201d. The couple took things one day at a time, she added.\n\nAsked if the counter-argument was that incredible power, privilege, fame and wealth came with scrutiny, she said: \u201cThat completely tracks for me if things are fair.\u201d But, she said, \u201cwhen people are saying things that are just untrue, and are being told they are untrue but they\u2019re still allowed to say them, I don\u2019t know anybody in the world that would feel that\u2019s OK.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s different to scrutiny \u2026 it\u2019s a really different beast. I think the grass is always greener \u2013 you have no idea \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to understand what it\u2019s like. I know what it seems like it should be. It\u2019s a very different thing. That\u2019s OK. The good thing is I have my baby, and my husband, and they\u2019re the best.\u201d\n\nBradby, who has been a friend of Harry\u2019s for 20 years, said the strain the 35-year-old royal was under was increasingly clear. Harry admitted he had to constantly manage the pressure. Speaking of the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, he said: \u201cAnd now I have a family to protect, so everything that she [Diana] went through, and what happened to her is incredibly raw, every single day. And that\u2019s not me being paranoid. That\u2019s just me not wanting a repeat of the past.\n\n\u201cAnd if anybody else knew what I knew, be it a father, be it a husband, be it anyone, they would probably be doing exactly what I\u2019m doing as well.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBut again for me, and for my wife, of course there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue. But we need to focus on being real, and focus on being the people that we are, and standing up for what we believe in.\u201d\n\nHarry also addressed a reported rift between him and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, claims of which emerged when he and Meghan broke away from the Cambridges to set up their own private office away from Kensington Palace, in Buckingham Palace.\n\nAsked if such reports were true, Harry said: \u201cPart of this role, and part of this job, and this family being under the pressure that it\u2019s under, [is that] inevitably stuff happens. But look, we\u2019re brothers. We will always be brothers. We are certainly on different paths at the moment \u2026 we don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy.\n\n\u201cBut I love him dearly, and the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. But, as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.\u201d", "description": "Royal speaks of struggling to cope with her new life in interview for ITV documentary", "authors": ["Caroline Davies", "Patrick Jephson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a3de0dffca81a9dc7edcbbfe0ad6514466e8b34/0_266_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c0e8d303d2788f5b640185bb300999bd", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
