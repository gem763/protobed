However, it\u2019s one of those Swedish flavours, similar to some of the dishes I\u2019ve come across in Japan \u2013 in particular, the marinated mackerel shime saba. I found that herring goes so well with other parts of the classic Japanese cuisine, too. This small salad tastes just as good served with rice as it does with new potatoes.\n\nServes 4\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u00bd cucumber\n\n100g (3\u00bd oz) pickled herring, preferably unflavoured or onion-flavoured, or you can substitute with shime saba\u200b\n\n1 tablespoon irigoma, or toasted sesame seeds\n\nWash the cucumber and slice into 1mm (1/32in) slices using a mandoline.\n\nCut the herring into 1 cm (\u00bd in) pieces. Reserve a little of the irigoma for garnish, then roughly grind the rest using a pestle and mortar.\n\nMix all the ingredients in a bowl and divide into portions to serve, sprinkling with the reserved irigoma.\n\nIf you have time then let the salad rest for 10 to 20 minutes to allow the cucumber to start releasing liquid, making the whole thing deliciously juicy.\n\n\n\nTofu and sesame salad\n\nThis dish was a regular on the table at my former Japanese host family\u2019s house. Maybe Yukiyo, my host mother, kept making it because she realised how much I liked it \u2013 I love tofu, sesame and most things that are a little sweet. It\u2019s a simple little dish that isn\u2019t too demanding either in preparation or in flavour.\n\nServes 4\n\n200 g (7oz) baby spinach, rinsed\n\n3 teaspoons irigoma, or toasted sesame seeds\n\n200 g (7oz) silken tofu\n\n2 tablespoons mirin\u200b\n\n1\u00bd teaspoons soy sauce or 2 teaspoons light soy sauce\n\n\u2153 teaspoon sugar\n\nBring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Blanch the spinach in the boiling water for 40 to 60 seconds, then immediately lift out and rinse under cold running water. When completely cool, use your hands to squeeze out any excess water, then set aside.\n\nReserve a few of the irigoma, then use a pestle and mortar to lightly grind the rest.\n\nPut all the ingredients except the spinach and reserved irigoma into a bowl and mix together until smooth. Separate the spinach from each other and fold into the tofu mixture. Sprinkle with the last of the irigoma.\n\nThis is best served at room temperature. It keeps for a day or two in the refrigerator.\n\nThis dish should not be very salty, so rather underdo than overdo the soy sauce, and serve it with another slightly salty dish to make a nice contrast.\n\nTamagoyaki\n\nFluffy, soft and with a touch of saltiness, this omelette is just as perfect for breakfast as it is for lunch or dinner. In the same way scrambled eggs need a certain degree of care, so does this. It can seem tricky at first, but there\u2019s no need to set the bar too high; a few times in the pan and you\u2019ll get the hang of it. Trust me, it\u2019s worth two or three failures. The original shape of the tamagoyaki requires a special, rectangular frying pan (page 17), which is not a common thing to have at home unless you are Japanese. A small frying pan (skillet) should work, even if it makes the rolling part a little bit trickier. It will also mean you won\u2019t be able to get the traditional shape, but the flavour will still be splendid.\n\nServes 4\n\n3 eggs\n\n1\u00bd tablespoons water\n\n\u00bd teaspoon dashi powder\n\n\u00be teaspoon soy sauce, light if available, plus extra for serving\n\nHandful of flat-leaf parsley (optional), chopped\n\n1 spring onion (scallion), sliced (optional), plus 1, sliced, to garnish\n\nVegetable oil, for frying\n\nCrack the eggs into a bowl, add the water, dashi powder and soy sauce and whisk together. Add the parsley and spring onion (scallion), if using. Heat a small frying pan (skillet) \u2013 or a rectangular pan, if you have one \u2013 to medium/high heat and add a splash of oil (don\u2019t be too shy with this).\n\nPour a quarter of the egg mixture into the pan and roll the pan around so that it\u2019s evenly spread out. Leave to cook until the egg sheet has almost coagulated.\n\nNow start the rolling process. Using a broad, thin spatula, fold over a small part of the egg and then roll the \u2018sheet\u2019 into a small roll.\n\nPush to the opposite end of the pan, add more oil if the pan is dry, then add another quarter of the egg mixture. Lift the roll so that the new egg mixture flows under and glues together the old and new egg. When nearly coagulated, start rolling again, so that the new egg rolls around the old. When that is all rolled up, push it to the other side of the pan and start the procedure again.\n\nKeep going until all the egg mixture is finished. Remove the roll from the frying pan and let it rest for a few minutes before cutting. Serve with a dash of soy sauce and a few slices of spring onion.\n\nThe Japanese Table by Sofia Hellsten (Hardie Grant, \u00a318)", "description": "Pickled herring\u00a0and cucumber sesame salad Pickled herring is not really what you\u2019d find at the Japanese table, I admit.
