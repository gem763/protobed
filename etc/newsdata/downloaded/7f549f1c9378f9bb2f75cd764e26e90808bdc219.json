But Trump may get in the way.", "language": "en", "text": "Chief Gallagher was acquitted of murder charges this summer, but evidence that he had engaged in a range of other misconduct, including theft and drug use, had come to light during the investigation. Admiral Green and other Navy leaders were planning to demote him and force him out of the SEALs \u2014 sending a message that such conduct had no place in one of the country\u2019s premier fighting forces.\n\nNone of that has happened, though, because one of Chief Gallagher\u2019s most vocal supporters happens to be the commander in chief. President Trump has repeatedly intervened, and has posted so many expressions of support for the SEAL on Twitter that the Navy now sees Chief Gallagher as untouchable, according to three Navy officials familiar with the case. Any talk of punishment has been shelved, not only for the chief, but for two other SEALs who had been facing possible discipline in the case, these officials said\u2026\n\n\u201cPeople want to hold these guys accountable,\u201d said one Navy officer who was involved in the punishment deliberations. \u201cBut they are afraid that if you do anything, minutes later there will be a tweet from the White House, and the officer in charge will get axed.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Edward-Gallagher-Navy-Seal.Html Smid Tw-Nytimes Smtyp Cur"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
