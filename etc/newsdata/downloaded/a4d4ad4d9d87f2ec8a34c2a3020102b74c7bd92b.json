But why would this matter? Tom Ough explains the financial impact of attending St John\u2019s College, Oxford, the second-wealthiest on our list.\n\nSt John\u2019s is legendary among Oxford students for its wealth and largesse. I studied there from 2011 to 2014, and everyone seemed to have a favourite story. One was that St John\u2019s had tried, when building a beautiful quad that opened in 2010, to put a swimming pool underneath it.\n\nThe university\u2019s other colleges, according to the legend, vetoed the plan, fearing that St John\u2019s would attract an even larger chunk of applicants than it already did. To new undergraduates, suddenly finding their lips around St John\u2019s enormous, gushing teats, this myth was as much a source of anger \u2013 how dare they take away our pool! \u2013 as amusement.\n\nAnother story had it that St John\u2019s wanted to abolish tuition fees, but was once again foiled by the penny-pinching cartel of Oxford\u2019s other colleges. This story was also probably untrue, but St John\u2019s endowment, at \u00a3632 million, is Oxford\u2019s largest and, if it were a GDP, would be bigger than that of Tonga.\n\nAlthough endowments are not a Scrooge McDuck pile of gold coins, their presence made life a whole lot easier. We ate subsidised food, we drank subsidised booze, we lived in on\u2011site accommodation that was among the cheapest in Oxford. We had something like \u00a3250 a year to spend on books, we had travel grants and scholarships and, if we fell on hard times, we could apply for emergency funding.", "description": "The Telegraph\u2019s Oxbridge College league table ranks each Oxford and Cambridge college by its financial assets, including endowment and net assets.", "authors": ["Tom Ough", "James Millar"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education-and-careers/2019/09/30/TELEMMGLPICT000193306931-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
