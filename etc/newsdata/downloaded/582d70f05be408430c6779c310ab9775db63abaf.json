Hopefully, it's a preview of a regular service that will speed up how people travel from one side of the globe to the other.\"\n\nResearch into the health and well-being of those on board were conducted during the flight with tests ranging from monitoring pilot brain waves, melatonin levels and alertness to exercise classes for passengers.\n\nJoyce added: \"We know ultra long haul flights pose some extra challenges but that's been true every time technology has allowed us to fly further. The research we're doing should give us better strategies for improving comfort and wellbeing along the way.\"\n\nThe next test flight will take place in November, from London to Sydney, while there will be another New York to Sydney flight before the end of the year.\n\nQantas has said it hopes to operate direct flights from three cities on Australia's east coast -- Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane -- and New York and London by 2022 or 2023.\n\nCaptain Sean Golding said: \"Overall, we're really happy with how the flight went and it's great have some of the data we need to help assess turning this into a regular service.\"\n\nThe Qantas Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane arrives at Sydney International Airport after flying direct from New York on Sunday, October 20, 2019.

Cameras were mounted in the cockpit to record pilot alertness.\n\n\"People seem to be wildly different when it comes to the experience of jetlag -- and we need more research on what contributes to jetlag and travel fatigue, so we can try and reduce the impact of long-haul flights,\" Professor Stephen Simpson, academic director of the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre, told CNN Travel.\n\n\"We have a long way to go in terms of understanding how the wide variety of influences -- including nutrition, hydration, exercise, sleep and light -- might work together for maximum benefit.\"\n\nl e v a r t\n\nMonash University scientists will focus on the flight crew, recording their melatonin levels before, during and after the flights, as well as studying brain wave data from electroencephalogram devices worn by the pilots.", "description": "Australian airline Qantas has completed the longest non-stop commercial passenger flight, researching the potential impacts of ultra-long haul flights on pilots, crew and passengers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191020084255-crew-on-the-qantas-flight-from-new-york-to-sydney-super-tease.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
