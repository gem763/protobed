Maybe 20 to 30 years ago I was trying to spread rock and roll in Japan ... After 30 years rock is part of our life,\u201d the co-founder of rock group X-Japan told reporters.\n\n\u201cSo one of my missions can be spreading kimono culture throughout the world, including Japan.\u201d\n\nYoshiki said he was still learning and seeking advice from the fashion industry.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time I\u2019d like to be kind of disruptive, I\u2019d like to break something. Art is all about destruction sometimes.\u201dBelgian model Yumi Lambert walked the runway in a short, strapless checkered white dress, tied with an obi-inspired bow, and with a choker and black high heels.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really honored to be wearing a kimono that\u2019s actually going in a new age,\u201d she said. \u201cShowing to the world that tradition can be adapted without being lost. I\u2019m very happy to be part of this show.\u201d\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum was the garment worn by Chinese model Naomi, which appeared to be a standard colorful kimono until closer inspection revealed a manga comic-strip pattern.\n\n\u201cRecently doing study abroad in Japan I had opportunities to wear kimono. But this time was different, with a lot of interesting things,\u201d Naomi said.\n\nRakuten Fashion Week Tokyo runs through Sunday, with 42 brands participating.", "description": "Rock met kimonos as Tokyo kicked off its fashion week with a dazzling runway show that put a modern twist on the traditional Japanese garment.", "authors": ["Chris Gallagher", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
