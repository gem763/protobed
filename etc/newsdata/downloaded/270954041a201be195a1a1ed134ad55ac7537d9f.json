REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull back troops from Syria\u2019s border with Turkey has been widely criticized in Washington as a tacit \u201cgreen light\u201d for a Turkish incursion that experts say could cause a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nBut the Pentagon denied accusations it had abandoned its Syrian Kurdish allies, its strongest partner in the battle against Islamic State, to the Turkish military onslaught.\n\n\u201cNobody green-lighted this operation by Turkey, just the opposite. We pushed back very hard at all levels for the Turks not to commence this operation,\u201d Defence Secretary Mark Esper told a news briefing, accusing Ankara of damaging ties.\n\nEsper and Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said they had spoken with their Turkish counterparts repeatedly in recent days, asking them to stop.\n\nBut there was no sense that Turkey would do so, they said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not seeing any indication or warnings of any planned stoppage of their military activity,\u201d said Milley, the top U.S. military officer.\n\nAfter Milley spoke, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey will not stop its operation against the Kurdish militia \u201cno matter what anyone says.\u201d\n\nSince it began on Tuesday, the Turkish incursion has opened a new front in the eight-year Syrian civil war and drawn international criticism. A war monitor gave a death toll of more than 100 so far and the United Nations said 100,000 people had fled their homes.\n\nTrump himself has come under withering criticism, including from stalwart Republican backers such as U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, for withdrawing the U.S. forces whose presence might have prompted Erdogan to hold off on sending in troops.\n\nOn Friday, Graham accused Turkey of serious crimes in Syria and said Trump was doing too little.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing ethnic cleansing in Syria by Turkey, the destruction of a reliable ally in the Kurds, and the reemergence of ISIS (Islamic State),\u201d Graham said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe conditional sanctions announced today will be viewed by Turkey as a tepid response and will embolden Erdogan even more,\u201d Graham said, adding Congress will pass severe sanctions with support from both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nA senior U.S. State Department official said late on Thursday that the department has been asked by Trump to see \u201cif there are areas of commonality between the two sides, if there\u2019s a way that we could find our way to a ceasefire.\u201d\n\nSANCTIONS, BUT NOT NOW\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared at the White House to announce that Trump had authorized U.S. officials to draft \u201cvery powerful\u201d new sanctions targeting Turkey, but the conditions under which they would be applied were unclear.\n\nMnuchin said the United States was not activating the sanctions at this time but would do so if necessary.\n\n\u201cWe are putting financial institutions on notice that they should be careful and that there could be sanctions,\u201d he said.\n\nMnuchin said Trump was concerned about potential targeting of civilians by Turkish forces, and wants to make clear that Turkey cannot \u201callow even a single ISIS fighter to escape.\u201d\n\nIn its first big attack since the assault began, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly car bomb in Qamishli, the biggest city in the Kurdish-held area of northeast Syria, even as the city came under heavy Turkish shelling.\n\nFive Islamic State fighters fled a jail there, and foreign women from the group being held in a camp torched tents and attacked guards with sticks and stones, the Kurds said.\n\nMilley told reporters he had just spoken with the chief of the Turkish General Staff, General Yasar Guler, who \u201cunderstands clearly\u201d that the prisoners would be Ankara\u2019s responsibility in areas where it carries out the offensive.\n\n\u201cWe, the U.S. military, have no responsibility to ... secure those ISIS prisoners in Syria,\u201d Milley said.\n\nPentagon officials also stressed the need for Turkey to avoid endangering U.S. forces inside Syria, who numbered about 1,000 prior to the incursion. Although U.S. troops had no intention of firing on Turkey, its North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally, the Pentagon noted they had the right to defend themselves.\n\nMilley said Turkey had been told of U.S. positions in Syria.\n\nAn explosion occurred on Friday near a U.S. military outpost near Kobane in Syria, a U.S. official said, but no U.S. personnel were reported hurt. The source of the blast was not immediately clear.", "description": "The United States ramped up efforts on Friday to persuade Turkey to halt an escalating offensive in northern Syria against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces, saying Ankara was causing \"great harm\" to ties and could face potentially devastating sanctions.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439846500&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A25P", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
