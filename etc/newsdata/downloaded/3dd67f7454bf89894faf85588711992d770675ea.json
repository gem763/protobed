Getting a heavier-than-air craft to fly on Mars is tough because Martian air is much thinner than Earth\u2019s.\n\nEarlier this year, JPL conducted tests of the helicopter in \u201ca simulated Martian environment\u201d that put the helicopter through temperatures as low as minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit and flew it in a vacuum chamber that simulated Martian air \u2014 it was also attached to a \u201cmotorized lanyard\u201d to help simulate Martian gravity. Some of the testing was to ensure that the Mars Helicopter could survive the conditions it would experience during an actual rocket launch.\n\nThe Mars Helicopter is now back at JPL, where it will has already had a new solar panel installed. NASA says that it isn\u2019t putting any science instruments on the helicopter beyond a camera, but that instead it\u2019s a \u201ctechnology demonstrator\u201d to prove that it\u2019s possible to remotely fly a Martian drone from Earth.\n\nThe Mars 2020 mission is still scheduled to launch in July 2020 and arrive on Mars on February 18th, 2021. You cannot go, but you can submit your name to be etched on a silicon chip that will be placed onboard. The main destination for the mission is the Jezero crater, where NASA hopes its rover might find signs of ancient life.", "description": "NASA\u2019s Mars Helicopter \u2014 which is exactly what you think it would be based on the name \u2014 has recently finished another round of important tests and is expected to be integrated with the rover for the Mars 2020 launch this summer.
