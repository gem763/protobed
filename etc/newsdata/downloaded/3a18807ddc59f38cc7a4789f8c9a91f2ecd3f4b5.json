Several other large companies have announced their departures .\n\nThe payment processing company Stripe said it was stepping back, as well as the online auction company eBay.\n\nPayPal was the first of Libra\u2019s big partners to exit, announcing last week it would no longer be involved.\n\nFacebook unveiled its plans for Libra in June 2019, announcing it meant to roll out the international digital currency publicly in 2020. Though it was built by Facebook, the company said the digital asset would be controlled by the Libra Association, a non-profit made up of a collective of international companies.\n\nFacebook Libra must meet strict standards, warns Bank of England Read more\n\nWhen Libra was announced, the Libra Association was comprised of around 30 founding companies. To be listed as founding members, these companies contributed a minimum of $10m (\u00a38m). The first official meeting of the Libra Council is scheduled for 14 October in Geneva \u2013 in just a few days.\n\nExecutives at Facebook and the Libra Association said the exits will not affect the product\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cAlthough the makeup of the association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra\u2019s governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient,\u201d said Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association.\n\nDavid Marcus, a former PayPal executive and co-creator of Libra, thanked Visa and MasterCard on Twitter on Friday, saying their dropping out is \u201cliberating\u201d.\n\n\u201cI would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not great news in the short term, but in a way it\u2019s liberating. Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you\u2019re on to something when so much pressure builds up.\u201d\n\nThe departures come as Facebook faces intensifying international legislative scrutiny over the currency. Politicians on both sides of the spectrum have questioned the privacy issues raised with Facebook controlling a currency, as well as concerns about money laundering.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Bank of England said Facebook would have to meet the central bank\u2019s highest standards in order to be allowed to launch in Britain. In July, members of the US Senate\u2019s banking committee grilled Facebook executives over the proposed currency for hours, questioning the privacy and security issues surrounding an international currency run by the social media giant.\n\nAs the Libra\u2019s backing slowly crumbles, Facebook\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is set to testify in front of Congress on 23 October.", "description": "Several large companies have announced their departure, including Visa and Mastercard, a week after PayPal exited", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e17f7a14ed04c843f947641884cd8a2ecd7677/0_82_3273_1964/master/3273.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=900f58e8fcbcc8f4359010986b4a267c", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
