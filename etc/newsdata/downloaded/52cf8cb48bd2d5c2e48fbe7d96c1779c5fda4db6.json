Trump has tweeted about Strassel or retweeted her more than 20 times, usually because she\u2019s raising an eyebrow at new reporting about Trump\u2019s behavior. After the report from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III came out in April, Trump suggested that Strassel get the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is also not surprising that Trump sent this column to that audience. Trump, like many observers, seems to think that an impeachment in the House is a foregone conclusion, meaning that it will be up to the Senate to decide whether Trump gets to remain in office. Trump hopes they\u2019ll be swayed by Strassel\u2019s column, an effort to broadly debunk the idea that an impeachment inquiry is warranted.\n\nLet us all hope that our elected senators are smarter than to accept Strassel\u2019s presentation as accurate. Below, I walk through the claims that Strassel makes, evaluating them and noting where they fall short. As the note from the White House began: Good afternoon, senators! Here\u2019s why Strassel\u2019s column is bad.\n\nThe central premise of Strassel\u2019s column is that Democrats seek to obscure a lack of fire by whipping up smoke. She compares the situation to the Mueller probe and to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDemocrats and the media for three years used a fog of facts and speculation to lull America into forgetting there was never a shred of evidence of Trump-Russia collusion,\u201d the column begins. \u201cThey flooded the zone with another flurry of scattershot claims in their campaign against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Republicans might bear these tactics in mind as they confront the left\u2019s new impeachment push.\u201d\n\nIn her first sentence, Strassel argues that \u2026 there was never any evidence of collusion? This is the argument from which she begins? There was never a campaign adviser who was informed about Russia having dirt on Hillary Clinton? There was never an email suggesting that the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign? There was never contact between WikiLeaks and members of the campaign?\n\nMueller\u2019s report found that there was insufficient evidence of any collusion between the primary Russian effort and the campaign to bring any charges. But neither the report nor common sense suggests that there was \u201cnever a shred of evidence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince Trump released the rough transcript of the call in July between himself and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Strassel writes, \u201cthe debate has descended into the weeds of process and people. This is unsurprising given House Democrats\u2019 decision to keep hidden the central doings of their impeachment inquiry, and the media\u2019s need to fill a void.\"\n\nThis is an utterly disingenuous argument \u2014 that the Democrats and the media are trying to obscure the question. The media in particular keeps asking Republican senators if the central question \u2014 should Trump have sought political help from a foreign leader? \u2014 is acceptable. Senators, like Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) keep responding by \u2026 descending into the weeds of process and people.\n\nStrassel admits as much! In short order she makes obvious that it\u2019s Republicans who are muddying the waters by focusing on the whistleblower who brought the Trump-Zelensky call to light.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans are \u201chighlighting the anonymous whistleblower, his motives and his methods,\u201d she writes. \u201cThey\u2019ve pointed out the whistleblower\u2019s admission that his information was secondhand. They\u2019re drilling into whether he was biased on behalf of a current Democratic presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nHow is this not descending into the weeds in a tangential way? The inspector general who reviewed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint noted that while there was some possible political bias by the whistleblower, the complaint itself was credible. The IG\u2019s determination, in fact, is the reason that Republicans knew about possible bias in the first place. But how does it matter? If a guy hears from his ex-wife that her new husband is selling drugs to children, should the police decline to investigate because the man is both biased and not observing the crime directly?\n\nAnyone arguing that motive matters here is willingly engaging in the obfuscation to which Strassel ostensibly objects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMotive matters,\u201d Strassel continues, \u201cbut what matters more is the accuracy of the complaint itself. The real news of the past few weeks has been the steady accumulation of evidence that its central claim is totally wrong.\u201d\n\nHow so? Well, she explains, because the whistleblower complaint \u201calleged, for instance, that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine to \u2018locate and turn over servers.\u2019 He didn\u2019t.\u201d It also \u201cclaims Mr. Trump \u2018praised\u2019 a prosecutor named Yuriy Lutsenko and suggested the Ukrainian president \u2018keep him in his position.\u2019 That didn\u2019t happen either.\u201d\n\nRemember: The whistleblower was hearing from people involved in the call what happened. The rough transcript of the call \u2014 which on its own first page notes that it\u2019s not a verbatim transcript \u2014 includes both a mention of a server and of an ousted prosecutor.\n\nHere\u2019s where Trump raised the issue of a server.\n\nHere\u2019s where he praised an unnamed prosecutor who was \u201cshut down,\u201d probably Lutsenko.\n\nStrassel\u2019s \u201cthe complaint was wrong\u201d argument is the sort of technicality-embracing pedantry that fifth-graders use to wriggle out things they don\u2019t want to do. That the whistleblower was aware of the discussion of the server, aware of the discussion of the prosecutor, aware of the discussion of former vice president Joe Biden captures the details salient to the issue at hand: what Trump wanted from the Ukrainian president. It\u2019s like our aforementioned ex-husband telling the police that the new husband is selling fentanyl, only to have the police learn that he\u2019s selling kids heroin. Except not even that far off the mark.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is simply no evidence of what House Democrats have made the central claim of their impeachment inquiry,\u201d Strassel writes, \u201cthat Mr. Trump engaged in a \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 by withholding aid to Ukraine unless it \u2018opened an investigation\u2019 into former vice president Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThis, my friends, is called a \u201cstraw man.\u201d\n\nWhen Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the impeachment inquiry, the focus was on Trump\u2019s request for political assistance from a foreign leader, something that Trump himself admits having done. Her critique was broader than just that, but it was clearly not an effort centered on an explicit quid pro quo of aid for a Biden probe.\n\nAD\n\nThat said, Trump did reply to Zelensky\u2019s indication that he wanted to buy weapons from the United States by saying, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though\u201d \u2014 investigate that server. There are lingering questions about why aid to Ukraine was withheld. There was a text message released in which Trump\u2019s Ukraine envoy prepared a Zelensky aide for the call by directly tying Zelensky\u2019s desire for a White House meeting to the Biden probe. There is a suggestion in text messages exchanged between administration officials that the aid was being withheld to pressure Ukraine to act on an investigation.\n\nAD\n\nStrassel waves this last point away in hilariously sloppy fashion.\n\nDemocrats \u201cneglect to point out that the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, shut down that claim in his own text: \u2018You are incorrect \u2026 The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,' \u201d she writes.\n\nAD\n\nFor her part, Strassel neglects to point out that Sondland went on to suggest that they \u201cstop the back and forth by text\u201d \u2014 in other words, stop discussing the issue in a place where there\u2019s documentation of what was said. (He had made the same point earlier in the discussion, too.) Strassel also declines to point out that Sondland\u2019s very formal reply came only after he spoke on the phone with Trump himself. Sondland\u2019s message reads less like a sincere rejection of the idea than like a news release from a law firm.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans, Strassel suggests, would \u201cbe better off uniformly noting that the central players in this episode, and the written record, have already refuted the complaint, and that anything further is theater, no different from the Russia-collusion hype.\u201d Neither the written record nor all of the central players have refuted the complaint; in fact, Trump himself has provided plenty of evidence that the whistleblower complaint was on the mark. What\u2019s more, the entire point of the investigation is to determine the extent of possible wrongdoing. Strassel asks Republicans to vote that her client is not guilty during the trial\u2019s opening statement.\n\nShe concludes in a masterpiece of irony.\n\n\u201cThe left is again counting on the public getting lost in a swirl of innuendo,\u201d Strassel writes. \u201cBut facts matter, especially when it comes to impeachment.\u201d", "description": "On Friday, the White House sent senators an iffy opinion column.
