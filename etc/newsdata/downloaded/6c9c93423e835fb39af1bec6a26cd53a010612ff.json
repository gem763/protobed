The pasta boiled over, put out the pilot light, they went to eat the food and later, the Princess came back into the kitchen. She could smell gas.'\n\nHe recalled the Princess soon realised it was from the pilot light - and so she called the Palace Fire Brigade.\n\n'On Monday morning, she said \"Darren, you won't believe what has happened, I nearly set the kitchen on fire, but the best part was, I had 12 hunky firemen to myself!\"'\n\n'The Princess was the worst cook ever!,' Darren told the program (Princess Diana pictured with Prince Harry in 1987)\n\nDarren (pictured) was also a regular at mealtimes for Princes William and Harry, and said that he fed them both purees, before they graduated on to a love of burgers and hot dogs\n\nIt wasn't only the People's Princess that Darren cooked for.\n\nHe was also a regular in the kitchen at mealtimes for Princes William and Harry, and said that he fed them both purees, before they graduated on to a love of burgers, hot dogs, fried chickens and cottage pies.\n\n'They were royal princes, but they still had children's palates,' he said.\n\nDarren added that he was always 'battling' with the nanny over making sure the royals both got enough vegetables.\n\nWhile Darren hung up his royal apron in 1997 after Princess Diana died, his time at Kensington Palace and Windsor Castle looms large in his memory.\n\nHe said it was the most 'amazing' experience of his life.\n\n'With the Queen, I got to travel all over the world to Sandringham, Windsor, Balmoral, Holyrood Palace, the Royal Britannia, and two visits to Australia,' he said.\n\nThe chef added that he imagines that Princess Diana is 'looking down [on her sons] right now' with a 'beaming heart'.\n\nWhile Darren hung up his royal apron in 1997 after Princess Diana died, his time at Kensington Palace and Windsor Castle looms large in his memory (the Duke of Duchess of Cambridge and Duke and Duchess of Sussex pictured)\n\nThis isn't the first time the royal chef has revealed details of the palace pantry.\n\nSpeaking to MailOnline previously, Darren claimed that Her Majesty is 'not a foodie at all' and prefers throwing dinners to actually eating them.\n\n'She's not a foodie at all,' Darren said.\n\n'She eats to live; it's Prince Philip that lives to eat. He loves food, he's interested in food, he wants to know where it comes from. The Queen, not so much.'\n\n'The best ones were state banquets when there was a king, queen or president visiting,' Darren said. 'That's when they'd break out the Rockingham china from Queen Victoria's coronation.\n\nDarren claimed that Her Majesty (pictured) is 'not a foodie at all' and prefers throwing dinners to actually eating them\n\n'She'd oversee the full menu, choose what she wanted \u2013 do we have enough pheasant, grouse, partridge? She loved food from the estate and to see her own produce on the menu,' he said.\n\n'She loved the hosting side of the event. Garden parties were huge we\u2019d have to do so much food, scones and pastries, ice cream made fresh.'\n\nDarren also outed Her Majesty as a 'chocoholic' whose favourite dessert was something called a 'chocolate perfection pie' - a pastry case lined with meringue, cinnamon and chocolate cream.", "description": "Former royal chef Darren McGrady has recalled what really went down in the palace pantry - and the night Princess Diana nearly burned the place down.", "authors": ["Sophie Haslett For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/04/20065956-0-image-a-37_1571800564303.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
