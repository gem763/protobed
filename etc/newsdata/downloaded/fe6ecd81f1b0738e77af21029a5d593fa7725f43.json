We're talking the 2030s for operational service, and the work is already very advanced,\" Turnock said.\n\nReaction Engines, a business based in Oxfordshire, is working on the hydrogen air-based rocket which could propel a plane at Mach 5.4, then speed it up to Mach 25 in space.\n\nFor comparison, that's about twice as fast as the wistfully-remembered Concorde, the supersonic passenger plane which ended service entirely in 2003.\n\nThe hydrogen air-based rocket is both greener and cheaper than current air travel technology. Reaction Engine Ltd.\n\nThe Concorde, which offered the last commercially-available supersonic flight, was scrapped after a flight between Paris and New York failed catastrophically during takeoff, killing 113 people.\n\nAccording to Reaction Engines, the hydrogen/oxygen engine used in SABRE is both greener and cheaper than current air travel technology.\n\nRead more: NASA's $30 billion Artemis missions will attempt to set up a moon base\n\nSpeaking at the Space Conference, Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines, explained the technology further:\n\n\"The main thing with Sabre is it's like a hybrid of a rocket engine and an aero engine, so it allows a rocket to breathe air. \"Most rockets are vertically launched, and if you look at spacecraft you have a tiny satellite at the top and a huge massive rocket because just carrying fuel means you need more fuel so it's a horrible cycle. \"Rockets really haven't progressed in 70 years, whereas aero engines have become very efficient, so if you can combine an aero engine and a rocket you can have a very lightweight efficient propulsion system and basically create a space plane.\"\n\nIt is still unclear whether or not the space plane will ever take off, as supersonic flights have always been a challenge commercially.\n\nAlthough Concorde flew for a bit, it wasn't economically feasible as airlines and passengers currently prefer efficiency and comfort to speed.\n\nBut the company hopes it will be able to begin test flights at some point in the next decade, aiming to have commercial flights operating by the 2030s.\n\nDavid Slotnick contributed to this report.", "description": "The space plane would be propelled by a new hypersonic engine called SABRE, which is greener and cheaper than current air travel technology.", "authors": ["Sophia Ankel", "James Hennessy", "Business Insider Australia"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8ccb6a2e22af5d24172c26-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
