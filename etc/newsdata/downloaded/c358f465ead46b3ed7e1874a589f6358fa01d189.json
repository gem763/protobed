Most simply want full democracy. But as anger towards Beijing and local leaders has grown during the protests the slogan \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d has become ubiquitous.\n\nBeijing has sought to portray the protests as a foreign-funded separatist movement.\n\n\u201cAs a Governor of one of the 30 NBA teams, and a Chinese having spent a good part of my professional life in China, I need to speak up,\u201d Tsai said.\n\n\u201cThe hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\u201d\n\nTsai, whose Nets play exhibition games against the Los Angeles Lakers in Shanghai on Thursday and in Shenzhen two days later, said \u201cthe Chinese psyche has heavy baggage\u201d when it comes to any territorial threat.\n\nHe pointed to China\u2019s suffering in the 19th and 20th centuries at the hands of foreign powers, saying they bullied China into ceding territory and signing exploitative treaties, and \u2014 in the case of imperial Japan \u2014 brutally invaded the country.\n\nThat period is known in China as the \u201cCentury of National Humiliation\u201d, ending with the Communist takeover in 1949.\n\n\u201cThe NBA is a fan-first league,\u201d wrote Tsai, who completed his takeover of the Nets in September.\n\n\u201cWhen hundreds of millions of fans are furious over an issue, the league, and anyone associated with the NBA, will have to pay attention.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has sought to distance itself from the comments by Morey, who also tried to calm the waters with a string of emollient tweets.\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided,\u201d Morey said. \u201cAnd I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention.\u201d", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Freedom of expression does not extend to issues China deems untouchable, the Taiwanese-Canadian owner of the NBA\u2019s Brooklyn", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/1993b2_brooklyn-nets-owner-joseph-tsai-has-waded-houston-rockets-hong-kong-controversy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
