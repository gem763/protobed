Washington imposed new tariffs from Sept. 1, and threatened more measures from Oct. 1 and Dec. 15.\n\nChinese banks likely extended 1.2 trillion yuan ($168.4 billion) in net new yuan loans last month, up from 1.06 trillion yuan in July but slightly below the tally of 1.28 trillion yuan in the same month last year, according to a median estimate in a Reuters survey of 27 economists.\n\nBroad M2 supply was seen unchanged last month from 8.1% growth in July. Annual growth of outstanding loans in August was seen edging down to 12.4% from July\u2019s 12.6%.\n\nSome analysts say the annual comparison is a better way to assess trends in China\u2019s credit growth, rather than more volatile monthly readings.\n\nAugust mortgage loans were widely expected to have stayed soft as the central government tightened scrutiny on banks and provincial governments in a bid to contain rapidly-growing household debt and ever-rising home prices.\n\nThe PBOC said the latest cut in banks\u2019 RRR will releases 900 billion yuan in liquidity to shore up the flagging economy.\n\nBut analysts caution that the large injection may still fall short of helping the real economy as business activity - from manufacturing and investment to retail sales - has been hit by the protracted Sino-U.S. trade war.\n\n\u201cThe RRR cut\u2019s main impact will be to lower interest costs of small firms, as they are more likely to use the cash to repay existing loans than to spend on new production activities,\u201d ING Greater China Economist Iris Pang said in a note.\n\nThe central bank also unveiled key interest rate reform last month by improving the mechanism used to establish the loan prime rate (LPR), in a move to further lower real interest rates for companies.\n\nBut the government\u2019s drive to encourage banks to lower lending rates was putting pressure on their profit margins. Some of China\u2019s five top-listed banks have warned they face pressure on earnings and asset quality as interest rate reform crimps margins and the trade war adds to uncertainty.\n\nAnalysts expect total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, to rise to 1.55 trillion yuan in August from 1.01 trillion in July.\n\nTSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.\n\nNet issuance of local government bonds are estimated to fall as the provincial authorities are already close to exhausting their annual bond quotas.\n\nChina\u2019s cabinet said on Wednesday it will allow local governments to issue special purpose bonds earlier than normal next year to help steady growth, and specified for the first time that about 20% of all special purpose bonds issued by every province could be used as project capital.\n\nBeijing is widely expected to announce more support measures, including modest cuts in various lending rates in the coming weeks and more RRR cuts, possibly in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the central bank surprised the market by not rolling over medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans on Monday, sending a signal it doesn\u2019t want to flood the banking system with liquidity, after Friday\u2019s cut in banks\u2019 required reserves.", "description": "New bank lending in China is expected to have risen slightly in August, a Reuters poll showed, but outstanding loan growth likely trended lower, raising pressure on policymakers to keep liquidity ample as companies ride out the trade war.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
