Kim Kardashian West joined sister Kendall Jenner at this year\u2019s Emmys, and the duo definitely brought their signature style to the carpet.\n\nAfter debuting a blonde hue on the Burberry runway last week, Kendall returned to her signature brunette shade on the Emmys red carpet. She styled her hair in a chic top knot to complement her dramatic Richard Quinn gown, which featured a black latex turtleneck top worn underneath a strapless floral gown.\n\nFor her part, Kim wore a sleek black Vivienne Westwood corset gown and layered necklaces including a diamond cross. And she kept true to her word: prior to the carpet, Kim shared on her Instagram story that she would not be wearing white to this year\u2019s Emmys as she\u2019s done in years past.\n\nWhile Kim has graced the Emmys red carpet twice before \u2013 with then-pregnant sister Kourtney Kardashian in 2009 and with her mom Kris Jenner in 2010 \u2013 this year marks the first time Kendall has attended TV\u2019s biggest night.\n\nView photos Frazer Harrison/Getty More\n\nView photos Jason Merritt/Getty More\n\nRELATED: A History of the Kardashian Jenner Family at the Emmys (So You Don\u2019t Have to Ask, \u2018Why Are They There?\u2019)\n\nThe sisters are at the show to present the reality category during the broadcast. When Keeping Up with the Kardashians first premiered in 2007, there was no reality category.\n\n\u201cI was just looking back at footage and I came in 2009 and sang this little bit about reality shows with Jimmy Fallon when he hosted and it was super embarrassing,\u201d Kim shared with Giuliana Rancic on E!\u2019s Live from the Red Carpet.\n\nWhen KUWTK first aired, Kendall was still in grade school.\n\n\u201cA lot of the kids weren\u2019t even watching it. But I do remember having a very positive association with it. My friends weren\u2019t weird about it. They weren\u2019t mean,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was actually okay. It didn\u2019t change my life as much as you would have thought it would. Everyone was super cool. It felt normal in a way.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeeing the sisters in a joint appearance has become an increasingly rare occurrence, as they\u2019re all busy pursuing their own careers. Kendall\u2019s Emmys appearance comes hot on the heels of her Milan Fashion Month appearances, where she walked the runway for Versace and Fendi.\n\nAnd Kim is busy juggling life as a mom of four, her various businesses (KKW beauty and SKIMS shapewear) and studying for her law exams.\n\nThe 71st Primetime Emmy Awards are airing live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles starting at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Fox.", "description": "Kendall Jenner Goes Back to Brunette as She Attends First Emmys with Sister Kim Kardashian", "authors": ["Brittany Talarico"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.mTpq_zfCu1Jm156qsWd3A--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MTU1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/624402deaf2648bd842087f58e90385b", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
