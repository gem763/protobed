My podcast consumption is meticulous and wide-ranging, with several in-app playlists tailored to news (Reveal, The NPR Politics Podcast, Jesuitical), science-fiction audio drama (Passenger List, Within the Wires), history (Slow Burn, Throughline) and, of course, plenty of music podcasts in conversational, story- and DJ-driven flavors.\n\nSo for this week's column, I'm taking a brief break from Bandcamp discoveries to share some of my favorite music podcasts or music-related episodes. From the community building around Mahalia Jackson's fried chicken restaurant franchise (Gravy) to 2 Live Crew's battle for freedom of speech (Mogul), from the rich and varied sounds of Southern hip-hop (Bottom of the Map) to the '90s Christian punk renaissance (Labeled) and from a Pakistani sibling duo's New Wave obsession (Lost Notes) to a bisexual, convent-burning, sword-wielding opera singer from France (Something True): there's a little bit of everything.", "description": "Listen to playlist of music podcasts, featuring 2 Live Crew's battle for freedom of speech, the '90s Christian punk renaissance a Pakistani sibling duo's New Wave obsession.", "authors": ["Lars Gotrich"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/15/2678012784_d2b997ca96_o_wide-6ce8986d73deaac3638e82ebafd558de4cb3b02b.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
