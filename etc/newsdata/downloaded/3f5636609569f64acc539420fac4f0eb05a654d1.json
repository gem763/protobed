The theme was Arabian Nights. I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put makeup on. I shouldn't have done that. I should have known better, but I didn't and I'm really sorry,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\"I take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn't have done it. I should have known better. It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognise it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.\"\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be worse for the prime minister, whose right-on reputation has begun unravelling over the past year in a minefield of scandal and political missteps.\n\nHis Liberal Party is fighting for its life in a general election on 21 October as many Canadians have tired of long-winded bromides with a cup of sanctimony thrown in.\n\nPolls have shown that the Liberals are running neck-and-neck with the Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nHowever, while his Conservative rival Andrew Scheer is outpolling Trudeau in the rest of the country, the PM still rules the roost in vote-rich Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province.\n\nHistorically, the party that wins Ontario \u2013 which includes heavily multicultural Toronto \u2013 wins the election.\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wearing brown face at a party in 2001, courtesy of Time magazine (AFP PHOTO / TIME MAGAZINE/TIME TWITTER FEED) More", "description": "And so, the progressive prince might actually be a frog.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rode into office in 2015 on a platform of politically correct platitudes that made him the darling of the left at home and the world over.", "authors": ["Brad Hunter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cj76OtJ6MWIs8gUlNp238Q--~B/aD0zNTA7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/e8abd6373f24ceebbd3eb8cb442c037c", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
