Their decline has been blamed on habitat loss, disease, dog attacks and climate change.\n\nKoala rescuer Cheyne Flanagan said the large blaze near Port Macquarie had engulfed a sanctuary where hundreds of genetically diverse koalas lived.\n\n\"Because it was of such high intensity, I think that the amount of deaths will be very high, unfortunately,\" Ms Flanagan told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nShe said rescuers feared \"carnage\", and had not been able to look for survivors because the fire was still burning.\n\nKoalas are common wildlife fatalities in bushfires. The tree-dwelling mammals usually cope by climbing to the top of trees and curling into a ball.\n\n\"If the fire goes through quickly and just singes their fur, they are fine and the fur will grow back,\" Sue Ashton of the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital told news agency AFP.\n\nBut if the fire continues to burn up the tree \"they'll perish\", she said. \"It's a national tragedy because this koala population is so unique.\"\n\nNew South Wales, Australia's most populous state, has experienced hundreds of fires in the past months.", "description": "\"It's a national tragedy,\" says one worker from a koala hospital in New South Wales, Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16A03/production/_109457629_gettyimages-452518400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
