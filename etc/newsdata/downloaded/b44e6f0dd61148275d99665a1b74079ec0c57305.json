The advocacy group Kids and Cars says a record 53 children were killed last year.\n\nVehicles would give drivers audible and visual alerts to check back seats every time they turn off the ignition.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Automakers have been exploring ways to address this safety issue, and this commitment underscores how such innovations and increased awareness can help children right now,\" David Schwietert, interim CEO of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that includes a dozen large car companies. Members of Global Automakers, an association of manufacturers based outside the U.S., also are taking part.\n\nAutomakers say the voluntary agreement will get the alerts installed faster than a government regulation, which takes four to eight years.\n\nOnly Tesla didn't agree to the reminders. A message was left Wednesday seeking comment from the electric car company.\n\nCALIFORNIA POLICE K9 DIES AFTER BEING LEFT IN HOT CAR\n\nSeveral automakers already are offering such a feature. General Motors, for instance, has a reminder on all of its four-door sedans, trucks and SUVs starting with the 2019 model year. Hyundai has pledged to make a similar system standard on its vehicles by 2022.\n\nThe auto alliance says the agreement is a minimum and doesn't preclude automakers from coming up with more sophisticated solutions.\n\nThe U.S. House is considering a bill that would require such alerts.", "description": "Drivers will be alerted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/SEAT.jpg"}
