You've got to play the cards you're dealt.\"\n\nMatthews also said he wants to put even more focus on the defensive side of his craft in hopes of getting more chances at the other end of the rink.\n\n\"I've come a long ways,\" he said. \"But there's definitely a lot of progress that can be made.\"\n\nMatthews said he spent some time this off-season thinking about Toronto's playoff exit at the hands of the Boston Bruins in the first round for the second consecutive spring.\n\nIt didn't help that the Bruins went onto make the Stanley Cup final before losing to the St. Louis Blues in seven games.\n\n\"Of course you think about it,\" Matthews said. \"It's always in the back of your mind \u2014 that kind of, 'What could have been?\"'\n\nThe sting of another playoff loss to the Boston Bruins lingers for Matthews. (Charles Krupa/Associated Press)\n\nThe Leafs made a number of off-season moves \u2014 many salary-cap related \u2014 that saw them wave goodbye to forwards Nazem Kadri, Patrick Marleau and Connor Brown, and defencemen Jake Gardiner, Ron Hainsey, and Nikita Zaitsev.\n\nAmong the players coming in are forwards Jason Spezza and Alexander Kerfoot, along with defencemen Tyson Barrie and Cody Ceci.\n\n\"Unfortunately it's the business part of the business where you see good guys, good teammates, good players having to go,\" Matthews said. \"(The new) guys are all going to contribute and help our team in different ways.\"\n\nThe loss of Marleau hit Matthews hardest after the veteran took him and Marner under his wing and treated them like de facto family members as rookies.\n\nInspired by Raptors\n\n\"Our friendship obviously goes beyond just being at the rink,\" Marleau said. \"We're all going to miss him.\"\n\nBut the Leafs and Matthews will push forward, hoping to take the next step in their evolution.\n\n\"The Achilles heel has been that first round,\" he said. \"Just trying to get over that hump. It's tough to really measure a successful season without reaching that ultimate goal and accomplishing it.\n\n\"It's been frustrating, especially the last two years \u2014 same team, same result. It's just making sure everybody's really focused and dialed in.\"\n\nAnd after seeing the euphoria surrounding the Raptors' NBA title win back in June, Matthews allowed his mind to wander to thoughts of what a Stanley Cup would mean to Toronto.\n\n\"It's tough not to, especially with how wild it was,\" Matthews said. \"It was amazing to see.\n\n\"It's our ultimate goal.\"", "description": "While a number of young players sit and wait as the clock ticks towards the opening of training camps next week, Maple Leafs star Auston Matthews was relieved he didn't have to deal with a similar cloud of uncertainty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5274373.1567809621!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hkn-maple-leafs-matthews-20190906.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
