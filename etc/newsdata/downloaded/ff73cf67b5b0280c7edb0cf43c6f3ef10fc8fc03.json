Ex-Blues strikers not firing and no understanding up front", "language": "en", "text": "Atletico Madrid looked like a side to be feared this year when they humiliated rivals Real Madrid in a 10-goal thriller in pre-season.\n\nDiego Costa smashed four past Zinedine Zidane's ageing side which set the precedent going into the new campaign \u2013 Atletico seemed to have figured out the formula for scoring freely and everything was pointing in the right direction.\n\nWith Atletico known for having one of the tightest defences in the game, it was just the ruthlessness in front of goal that was missing from their arsenal.\n\nJoao Felix (left), Alvaro Morata (centre) and Diego Costa (right) have started the season slowly\n\nThe loss of talisman Antoine Griezmann to Barcelona this summer appears to be taking its toll\n\nFollowing the controversial \u00a3108million departure of Antoine Griezmann Catalan giants Barcelona, Atletico acted quickly to bring in his replacement.\n\nJoao Felix, who cost the club \u00a35m more than they received for the Frenchman, may be inexperienced but the Portuguese starlet is considerably younger and had a standout year with Benfica last season.\n\nThe 19-year-old was lauded for overshadowing Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2-1 pre-season win over Juventus that saw him score both goals in the encounter, but since then, things have stagnated at the Wanda Metropolitano.\n\nJoao Felix started pre-season brightly by scoring a game-wining brace against Juventus\n\nCosta also smashed four goals past Real Madrid in Atletico's 7-3 thumping pre-season victory\n\nWhile Atletico are still keeping pace with La Liga's top two, their performances have left fans frustrated with three of their last four league games ending as goalless stalemates.\n\nCosta, who was the star of the show in the 7-3 win over Real, is now a shadow of his former self, managing just one goal in eight games this season.\n\nAnother Chelsea signing, Alvaro Morata, is also firing blanks and has matched Costa's total in two fewer games.\n\nAnd their summer marquee signing has managed to find the back of the net three times \u2013 a concerning total considering his hefty price-tag.\n\nHowever, all three of Atletico's strikers have struggled since the start of the new campaign\n\nThe stats don't make for good reading, either, with Atletico registering 40 shots on goal so far this campaign, 39 fewer than they had at this stage last year and a staggering 96 fewer than they had during the 2016-17 season.\n\nThose 40 shots have produced just seven goals, their worst tally since the 2003-04 season and the loss of Griezmann appears to be taking its toll.\n\nIt's no secret that Simeone is more defensive-minded than all-out attack, with Atletico's goals-for tally always a far cry from the total Real and Barcelona post at the end of each season.\n\nSimeone will take responsibility for the lack of goals but his strikers need to start producing\n\nTheir defence has been top-tier for the most part, with Diego Simeone's men only conceding four times \u2013 the joint best in La Liga.\n\nAnd while the Argentine will take the responsibility for his side's lack of goals, it will be Costa, Morata and Felix who need to find their shooting boots sooner rather than later.\n\nIf they don\u2019t, and the goal drought continues, it could be another season of so near, yet so far for the boys in red and white.", "description": "While Atletico are still keeping pace with La Liga's top two, their performances have left fans frustrated with three of their last four league games ending as goalless stalemates.", "authors": ["Sam Mcevoy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/10/19685406-0-image-a-41_1571046672396.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
