Photo: Las Culturistas/Twitter\n\nAre you new to comedy podcasts, overwhelmed by the array of options, and wondering where to begin? Then welcome to Start Here, a recurring guide to the best comedy podcasts \u2014 and our recommendations for which episodes are the best entry points to your next auditory obsession.\n\n\u201cDing dong, Las Culturistas calling!\u201d\n\nSo declare the harmonizing voices of comedians Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers at the top of their Shorty-nominated Forever Dog podcast, Las Culturistas. Spunky, brash, and a touch absurd \u2014 after all, what is a \u201cculturista\u201d? \u2014 the introduction perfectly sets the tone for this delightfully screwy show.\n\nOn paper, Las Culturistas appears to be only the most recent of a seemingly endless stream of similar programs. From WTF to Conan O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend, podcasts centered on conversations with famous and/or funny people are a dime a dozen. Most are redundant, and many are bores, with guests mined from the podcast circuit often rehashing stories they shared elsewhere.\n\nBut since launching Las Culturistas in 2016 with a point-by-point look at the Grammys, Yang and Rogers have turned their two-headed snark routine into something greater than the sum of its parts: a culture show as enchanted by pop iconography as it is willing to interrogate it. While Matt can be mothering and overly complimentary \u2013 an advocate even for the sloppiest of media personalities \u2013 Bowen is quick to deploy his lacerating tongue when aesthetically offended. Few podcasts so heavily rely on their hosts calling one another \u201choes,\u201d but because both Yang and Rogers are equally culturally literate, their bickering never dips too far into savagery or sentimentality.\n\nEach episode launches with an interview, followed by \u201cI Don\u2019t Think So, Honey!,\u201d a 60-second game in which hosts and guests alike rail against their social pet peeves (\u201cI don\u2019t think so, honey: fantasy movies with long-ass titles!\u201d). Interspersed among these segments are nuggets of faux-wisdom invented by Yang and Rogers called the \u201cRules of Culture.\u201d\n\nIn early episodes, Yang, a writer and upcoming cast member for Saturday Night Live; and Rogers, an Upright Citizens Brigade mainstay, pulled their guests primarily from the somewhat exclusive New York comedy scene. As a result, while the hosts gagged equally for everyone they spoke to, some of those first interviews descended into inside baseball. For every instance of, say, Sudi Green celebrating America\u2019s love for Ellen, there was Joel Kim Booster making minced meat of hyperspecific Off Broadway theater.\n\nAs the show and its adored live spinoff, I Don\u2019t Think So, Honey!, became more widely known, however, Yang and Rogers opened it up to guests from outside their personal circles. Their ability to wax rhapsodic about awards shows or RuPaul ad infinitum quickly grew into a shared skill for creating a bouncy, buoyant chemistry with both friends and complete strangers from the world of show business.\n\nAt no time (except in their conversation with Vulture\u2019s own Jesse David Fox, of course) was this newfangled chemistry more electrifying than in the aptly numbered 69th episode, \u201cConstant Comment,\u201d featuring the reigning king of charisma, Nathan Lee Graham.\n\nWhen the episode was released on January 31, 2018, Graham was not a household name; his most famous role is probably still as Mugatu\u2019s assistant, Todd (\u201cMy mistake, Jacobim!\u201d), in Zoolander. Yang is quick to point out that even though Zoolander was one of the most formative films of his and Rogers\u2019s lives, Graham\u2019s visit was not their idea: It was pitched to them by their producer, HPJ (Hot Producer Joe, a.k.a. Forever Dog co-founder Joe Cilio) while Graham was promoting Fox\u2019s LA to Vegas.\n\nNonetheless, their excitement to have Graham in this \u201cgaggerino\u201d of an ensemble is palpable. Rogers even kvells, \u201cWhen I found out that we were going to have our guest on the show, I had kind of a moment!\u201d Graham seems thrilled, too, revealing that he brought multiple pop-culture grievances to share during the climactic round of \u201cI Don\u2019t Think So, Honey!\u201d\n\nThe conversation turns warm fast, with much praise given to Graham\u2019s career as an actor in shows like The Comeback and Scrubs (\u201cThat\u2019s actually Rule No. 64 of Culture: Come through, Scrubs!\u201d). Eventually, the subject of his good looks comes up. \u201cThere\u2019s cheekbones for days! And jawline!\u201d Rogers says as a compliment. \u201cWell thank you \u2014 no work done yet,\u201d jokes Graham. \u201cBut I\u2019m not above it!\u201d From this emerges the Culturistas\u2019 Rule of Culture No. 4: If you look like you had work done, it didn\u2019t work.\n\nIt\u2019s not long before the men are calling one another \u201cbitch\u201d affectionately. Such talk, which on any other show might feel superficial or catty, actually provides the gateway into the episode\u2019s deeper waters. Yang and Rogers, both gay men still in the early stages of their careers, seize on their comfort with Graham by probing him with questions about being black and queer on a mainstream show like LA to Vegas. When he scolds uninformed listeners to keep up, Yang deadpans: \u201cIt\u2019s not a lightning round \u2014 it\u2019s an en-lightening round.\u201d\n\nAs the joking turns a touch serious, Graham reveals that he\u2019s proud to \u201cmake some history here\u201d as \u201cthe first out flight attendant on network television.\u201d This landmark of representation \u2014 a common, historically queer character actually played by a gay man \u2014 is not lost on the hosts, who gasp in response.\n\nGraham then uses the platform to advocate for similar characters throughout entertainment. \u201cI just think we should be everywhere, in every story. It\u2019s not like \u2018Oh, he\u2019s gay.\u2019 No, this is another person; this is another narrative; this is another fabric of human existence.\u201d\n\nSo earnest and profound is the moment that it takes Rogers and Yang a full 20 minutes of Zoolander stories to return to their familiar, snappier on-air personas. Finally, with only 12 minutes left in the episode, \u201cI Don\u2019t Think So, Honey!\u201d kicks into high gear. Rogers decries, \u201cWhen I watch an awards show, and it\u2019s as if there\u2019s only one movie or one song or one album that came out that whole motherfuckin\u2019 year,\u201d while Yang scolds, \u201cLas Culturistas listeners who keep telling Matt and I to comment on Britney Spears\u2019s Instagram!\u201d\n\nYet it is Graham, equipped with a host of complaints, who again takes command. \u201cI walk fast enough, but if you think you\u2019re gonna get your little butt in front of me, AND THEN WALK SLOWER?\u201d He then proceeds to annihilate people who don\u2019t understand Jordan Peele\u2019s Get Out: \u201cIt\u2019s a satire. \u2018What\u2019s a satire?\u2019 Read a book, bitch.\u201d\n\nThe hosts, upstaged and awed, instantly declare the episode one of their favorites, even suggesting that Graham become their third co-host. He agrees to the job, but has not returned to the show since. Looking at the nearly two years of Las Culturistas that followed, as the show has grown into a minor phenomenon, this may have been the right decision. After all, you have to honor Rule of Culture No. 17: Always keep them wanting more.", "description": "Highlighting the best episode of comedians Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang\u2019s podcast \u2018Las Culturistas\u2019 featuring guest Nathan Lee Graham.", "authors": ["Sean Malin"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/18/18-las-culturistas-best-episode.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
