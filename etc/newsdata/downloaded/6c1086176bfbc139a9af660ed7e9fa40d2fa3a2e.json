While both Democrats and Republicans criticized Jeffrey\u2019s policy and its disastrous results for the Kurds, nothing Jeffrey said should surprise. After all, when he spoke to reporters last December after a U.S.-Turkey Working Group Jeffrey reportedly said that U.S. cooperation with the Kurds was tactical and temporary, but that it was bilateral ties with Turkey that mattered. \u201cWe want to have cooperation with Turkey across the board on all Syrian issues.\u201d This is a logic that Trump supporters in the foreign policy community embraced. Bush administration alum Michael Doran explained at a Hudson Institute panel, \u201cWe borrowed a Russian and Iranian proxy, and it was strategically stupid,\" Doran added. \u201cEveryone knows we\u2019re leaving sooner or later. Turkey is going to be there forever, and the Turks know this as well. So we have to work through them, largely on their terms.\u201d\n\nThere is a fundamental problem with this argument, however. Turkey may once have been an important ally and partner, but if Jeffrey, Doran, and supporters of Trump\u2019s strategy believe Turkey is an ally, then the word simply has no meaning at all.\n\nTurkey says it is acting to defend itself from terror. But what Turkish officials tell their American counterparts is one thing; what they tell regional extremists is another. As Turkish forces poured across the border, Erdo\u011fan tweeted in Arabic, \u201cI kiss the foreheads of all the hero members of the Muhammadian army\u201d entering Syria, not a statement typical NATO leaders say. He was not alone. Turkish Interior Minister S\u00fcleyman Soylu then told CNN T\u00fcrk that Turkey would \u201cmake a deal with ISIS.\u201d This may not be bluster. The only reason why the United States began its alliance with Syrian Kurds in the first place was because of overwhelming evidence that Turkey was passively if not actively support the Islamic State (ISIS). A Wikileaks dump of personal emails from Berat Albayrak, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s son-in-law and, at the time, Energy Minister, showed efforts to profit off of ISIS oil. At the battle for Kobane, Turkey allowed ISIS fighters to attempt to outflank Kurdish defenders and to attack from the Turkish side of the border. Captured passports and identity cards from ISIS fighters show most openly traversed Turkey\u2019s territory. ISIS even maintained a de facto ambassador in Turkey to liaise with Turkey\u2019s intelligence services. Turkey has incorporated Islamic State veterans into its proxy Free Syrian Army.\n\nTurkey\u2019s past actions in Syria raise serious concerns about its commitment to its neighbor\u2019s territorial integrity. On January 20, 2018, Turkish forces entered Syria\u2019s northwestern Afrin district, supposedly to combat terrorism. They forced tens of thousands of Kurds and Christians to flee. Those who remained had to exchange their Syrian identity cards for Turkish-issued ones. Kurds say women who remain cannot get an ID unless they wear conservative head coverings. Maps shown on Turkish television show northern Syria (and parts of Iraq, Greece, Bulgaria, and Armenia) incorporated into Turkey. Again, this is not just bluster. In the northern Syrian town of Jarabulus, Turkey opened a civilian post office sporting a Turkish flag.\n\nThe most tragic element in Turkey\u2019s operation has been, despite Trump\u2019s assurances, the impact on religious freedom and the local civilian population. Among Turkey\u2019s first targets was Bisheriya, the largest Christian neighborhood in Qamishli city, setting houses alight and killing several civilians, even though there were no apparent Kurdish military positions in the area. Turkey also assaulted Amudeh, one of the few towns left in Syria with a Jewish population. This was no surprise: Since the Turkish assault began, more than 100,000 fled their homes. Many experts believe that figure will skyrocket.\n\nNo one should be surprised by Turkey\u2019s actions in northern Syria. Its casus belli\u2014to fight terrorism\u2014was contrived. For all Turkish authorities speak about Kurdish terrorist groups in northern Syria, they and their supporters have been unable to show any recent attacks planned or executed from the towns and villages they now bombard.", "description": "Turkey says it is acting to defend itself from terror.
