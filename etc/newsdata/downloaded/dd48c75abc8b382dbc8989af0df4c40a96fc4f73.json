Here\u2019s what you need to know\u2026\n\nWhere was World On Fire filmed?\n\nWorld On Fire features a whole plethora of storylines across a string of countries, including Poland, France, Great Britain and Germany.\n\nThe action was shot in Manchester and Prague which doubled for Paris, Berlin and Warsaw (Picture: BBC)\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it was filmed in all those places \u2013 with most of the action being shot in Manchester, and in the Czech Republic\u2019s capital city Prague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact the city stood in for most of the continental action, doubling for Warsaw, Berlin and Paris \u2013 although parts of the Polish capital were also recreated in Manchester, with scenes being shot around the Castlefield area.\n\nA lot of the action was also filmed in Manchester, which also doubled for the Polish capital (Picture: BBC)\n\nSpeaking of their Prague shoot, executive producer Helen Ziegler told the Radio Times: \u2018We found this amazing location just outside the site, this devastated factory.\n\n\u2018It looked like it had been bombed [it had actually been half-demolished] and it had this eerie beauty to it.\u2019\n\nThe drama follows the effect of the Second World War on the lives of ordinary people (Picture: BBC)\n\nMeanwhile director Adam Smith added: Prague was amazing to work in, with some fantastic locations. We built a big set of Warsaw. We tried to get as much real location as we could, then add CGI [computer-generated imagery] on top.\u2019\n\n\u2018We also pretended parts of Manchester were Warsaw. \u2018And parts of Wigan were Paris. It was a really confusing shoot!\u2019\n\nWatch out for the beach in episode five (Picture: BBC)\n\nThings might just get even more confusing later on in the series as Dunkirk enters the fray \u2013 with those scenes actually being shot in Blackpool, specifically, on St Anne\u2019s Beach.\n\nYou\u2019ll get to see those scenes in episode five.\n\nWho is in the cast of World On Fire?\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSean Bean appears in the series as pacifist Douglas Bennett, who faces a challenging time after both his son and daughter are sent to fight in the war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOscar-winning actress Helen Hunt is also in the cast as journalist Nancy Campbell, while other cast members include Blake Harrison, Lesley Manville, Jonah Hauer-King, Julia Brown, Yrsa Daley-Ward and Kasia Tomaszeski\n\nWorld On Fire continues on BBC One on Sunday night at 9pm.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
