You tried your best\u2019.", "description": "Contestant Souleyman Bah became the third contestant to be fired from the BBC show, during tonight's week three episode", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20638006.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_161019the-apprentice_6358JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
