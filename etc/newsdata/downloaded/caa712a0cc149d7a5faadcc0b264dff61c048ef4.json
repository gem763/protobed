Ten Democrats. Another chance to try to get ahead in the crowded Democratic presidential primary field.\n\nHere's an early take on how they did:\n\nWinners\n\nThe voters\n\nIn a sprawling field of 20, viewers of Thurday night's debate only had to focus on 10 -- cutting the field in half at least for a single night's three hours of live television.\n\nTen of the Democratic contenders qualified for the debate. With the fundraising and polling criteria doubled from the two previous debates, the change gave voters the opportunity to observe the candidates with the highest polling and sufficient fundraising under the DNC's rules on one stage, all together.\n\nThe gun debate, especially Beto O'Rourke\n\nThe Democratic candidates passionately discussed their views on the best way to respond to gun violence in the country and offered various points of view and solutions.\n\nThis issue was among the most important for voters leading into the debate following multiple mass shootings this summer.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota discussed the need to close the \u201cboyfriend loophole,\u201d and keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. Klobuchar also called out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., for the Senate's inaction on gun control, saying that \u201cWe have to send a message to Mitch McConnell, we can't wait until one of us gets in the White House.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont bragged about his F rating from the NRA and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said \u201dWe have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry.\"\n\nOn the president\u2019s influence and the El Paso shooting that was apparently motivated by anti-immigrant views, Sen. Kamala Harris of California said Donald Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t pull the trigger, but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in the debate: Democratic debate featured frontrunners who battled each other, attacked Trump\n\nBut former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke was perhaps the strongest candidate on the issue of gun violence and was praised by nearly every other candidate on stage for his response after the El Paso mass shooting.\n\nO'Rourke: 'Hell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47' to keep children safe\n\nOf O\u2019Rourke, frontrunner Joe Biden said: \"The way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful. To look in the eyes of those people, to see those kids, to understand those parents, to understand the heartache.\u201d\n\nIn on his best moments of the night, when arguing for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons, O\u2019Rourke declared, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" as the crowd erupted. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nTime spent on health care\n\nHealth care has consistently emerged a top concern of Democratic voters.\n\nThough the candidates sparred and differed in their opinions on health care, a significant amount of time was spent on the topic at the beginning of the nearly three-hour broadcast -- a nod to how important the issue is to Democrats and the country.\n\nThe candidates spent over 40 minutes discussing the issue at the beginning of the debate.\n\nAnd though their views varied, the candidates came to the consensus that all Americans deserve coverage, and Trump isn\u2019t delivering.\n\n\"Let's focus on the end goal. If we don't get Donald Trump out of office, he's going to get rid of all of it,\" Harris declared.\n\nThursday night displayed that the Democratic candidates want to go further than the current system in providing health insurance coverage for all Americans but disagree about allowing people to buy in to Medicare -- and whether to keep private insurance or to get rid of private coverage altogether.\n\n\u201cThere's something fundamentally wrong when one of the richest and most powerful countries can't make sure a person can afford to see a doctor,\u201d Warren said.\n\nThe three frontrunners -- Biden, Sanders, and Warren -- had a particularly lengthy clash over the issue, which suggested a longer-term debate within the Democratic Party over health care policy.", "description": "Health care dominated the first hour of the debate, Juli\u00e1n Castro's attacks on Joe Biden didn't land well and Beto O'Rourke was praised by his fellow candidates for the way he talked about gun violence in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Rebecca Morin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q9u.UuCYv2Cqvyi6gHqBSQ--~B/aD0yNDI4O3c9MzY0MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/4cb607371765254c37cadc6158cc0085", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
