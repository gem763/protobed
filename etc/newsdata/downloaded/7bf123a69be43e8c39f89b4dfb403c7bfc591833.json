But in a decision published last week, the Turkish government\u2019s board for the protection of minors from obscene publications said: \u201cSome of the writings in the book will have a detrimental influence on the minds of those under the age of 18.\u201d\n\nThat means it can only be sold to adults and must be concealed from view in shops.\n\nOne of the authors, US-based Francesca Cavallo, said she was saddened by the decision. She said: \u201cGirls deserve to grow up surrounded by more female role models. They deserve to grow up thinking that they can be anything they want.\n\n\u201cWhen a government is scared by a children\u2019s book promoting equality, that means that promoting these messages through children\u2019s literature can have and is having an impact, and it makes me even more motivated to keep fighting every day.\u201d\n\nThe book has been a publishing phenomenon since emerging in 2016 from one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns ever, spawning sequels, spinoffs and many copycats. Cavallo said the only difficulty it had faced until now was Russia\u2019s decision to censor the profile of a transgender girl in the book.\n\nThe Turkish publishers\u2019 association released a statement this week, saying the government decision was \u201ca danger from the perspective of freedoms of expression and press, and a threat to the principles of a democratic society\u201d.\n\nThe book\u2019s Turkish publisher said it was waiting for the decision to be officially communicated to it before commenting.", "description": "Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls must only be sold to adults, government says", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Istanbul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8460ed0e74442c3d96cc94dda666c9bff243b1c2/143_144_4226_2536/master/4226.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=44467382343fee639bda1dbe7571127c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
