Former U.K. Home Secretary Sajid Javid referred to the technology as \u201cgame-changing\u201d in the fight against child abusers, as did Chris Phillips, former head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office.\n\n\u201cIf there are hundreds of people walking the streets who should be in prison because there are outstanding warrants for their arrest, or dangerous criminals bent on harming others in public places, the proper use of AFR has a vital policing role,\" Phillips said in May.\n\nBut critics see a sinister potential. At least 18 countries are now importing the Chinese technology that Beijing uses to racially profile and closely track the country\u2019s 11 million Uighurs, a Muslim minority in China\u2019s northwest, amid reports that the technology disproportionately misidentifies ethnic minorities.\n\n\u201cIt can be used for really noble and well-meaning ends, but it can also be used maliciously, and it can also be used for well-intended purposes that have very serious social consequences,\u201d said Karen Yeung, a University of Birmingham Law professor and AI expert.\n\nIn Europe, police use of facial recognition is set to expand in the absence of any overarching legal framework.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not someone who\u2019s shy about putting their head above the parapet\u201d \u2014 Ed Bridges, privacy campaigner\n\nAnd as Ed Bridges\u2019 lawsuit shows, average citizens are severely limited in their ability to contest or refuse facial recognition in public when police are behind the cameras.\n\nHis campaign started back in December of 2017, when the Welsh office worker noticed a police van marked with the words \u201cfacial recognition\u201d parked on Cardiff\u2019s main thoroughfare and decided to investigate.\n\nThe U.K. Home Office had awarded the South Wales Police almost \u00a32 million in January 2017 to trial AFR. The force initially deployed the technology \u2014 supplied by Japanese firm NEC \u2014 at a large football event in Cardiff in May and June of 2017, and has subsequently used AFR over 50 times.\n\nCompelled by basic misgivings about the technology, Bridges agreed to be the main complainant in a high-profile lawsuit against the South Wales Police launched in May of this year.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t wake up one morning and think, I really want to take my local police service to court,\u201d Bridges told POLITICO during an interview in Cardiff ahead of the court decision. \u201cBut sometimes you just find you\u2019re the right person at the right time to take something forward.\u201d\n\nA family man and fan of Liverpool Football Club who served for 13 years on his local council as a Liberal Democrat, Bridges in many ways embodies the regular citizen up against increasingly powerful surveillance tools that track our movements on the internet and in the streets.\n\nHaving tried and failed to get the South Wales Police to cease their use of facial recognition until a full review had been completed, he took on the role of complainant in a legal challenge being brought by Liberty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not someone who\u2019s shy about putting their head above the parapet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s an important issue and I don\u2019t mind being the person who raises it.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of Bridges' effort was the argument that automatic facial recognition has no explicit legal basis in the U.K.\n\nWhile commercial uses of AFR are subject to strict regulation under the GDPR, that regime doesn\u2019t always apply to police. Under a separate EU directive, law enforcement agencies can process biometric data without consent in certain circumstances.\n\nIn the meantime, the use of facial recognition tools is expanding.\n\nLast month, the South Wales Police announced the trial of a new app for police officers \u2014 one that allows them to snap pictures of persons of interest and run them against a watch list on the spot.", "description": "Ruling is a blow for privacy advocate who led legal challenge.", "authors": ["Isabella Borshoff", "Mark Scott", "Laura Kayali"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1149113711-1200x628.jpg"}
