And the pics are super cute! And Stormi is adorable! And Kylie looks incredible per usual!\n\nBut because Instagram trolls can be the literal worst, Kylie's dealing with a lot of extremely shame-y comments about her body. This is hardly the first time people have @-ed the world's youngest self-made billionaire about her look\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe's constantly dealing with people accusing her of photoshopping her pics and of getting \"too much plastic surgery.\" But people seem especially, um, \"concerned\" (quotes 'cause it's no one's business!) about these pics:\n\nComments on this post are kinda a lot, ranging from \"someone's got great editing skills huh?\" to \"y'all really stingy with the surgeon's info,\" to \"no human should be shaped that way,\" to \"with all due respect your hips just look unnatural it doesn't match your body frame.\"\n\nUgh. If Kylie has had surgery that is 100 percent her business, so the internet should probably back TF off. Especially since Kylie is currently in the midst of a breakup with Travis Scott and is just trying to chill with her daughter, people.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "These comments are so freakin' much.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FDqz7kb9wSg0sWyzCuF2Cg--~B/aD0yMDM7dz00MDQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/seventeen_632/e60c2714bd4fab98a6ef65287e9704c1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
