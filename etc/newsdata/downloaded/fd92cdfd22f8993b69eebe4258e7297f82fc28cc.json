(Getty Images)\n\nToronto is the second-most overvalued real estate market in the world, according to a UBS report.\n\nThe Global Real Estate Bubble Index found only Munich is deeper into bubble territory.\n\n\u201cPrice bubbles are a regularly recurring phenomenon in property markets. The term \u2018bubble\u2019 refers to a substantial and sustained mispricing of an asset, the existence of which cannot be proven unless it bursts,\u201d said the report.\n\n\u201cThe UBS Global Real Estate Bubble Index gauges the risk of a property bubble on the basis of such patterns.\u201d\n\nExperts say Toronto\u2019s plight is due to factors like a lack of supply and foreign money. But measures to tackle the issues it faces have largely been unsuccessful in countering rising prices.\n\n\u201cReal housing prices in the city almost tripled between 2000 and 2017.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs in Vancouver, local authorities introduced a foreign buyers\u2019 tax, rent controls and tighter mortgage standards to tackle worsening affordability.\u201d\n\nVancouver is lower down the list in seventh place, but is still considered a bubble risk.\n\n\u201cIn just a couple of quarters, year-on-year price growth rates have reversed from 10 per cent to minus seven per cent,\u201d said the report.\n\n\u201cSky-high valuations and overstretched affordability have made the market vulnerable to even minor demand shifts.\u201d\n\nDespite the cooldown, Vancouver is still home to Canada\u2019s highest-priced real estate with the average home costing as much as $993,300.\n\nHong Kong, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich, London and San Francisco round out the top 10.\n\nUBS said we could be at the end of the global boom in high-priced real estate markets.\n\n\u201cPrice growth rates have continued to slow in a majority of cities,\u201d said the report.\n\n\u201cAverage price growth has come to a standstill for the first time since 2012.\u201d\n\nJessy Bains is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance Canada.
