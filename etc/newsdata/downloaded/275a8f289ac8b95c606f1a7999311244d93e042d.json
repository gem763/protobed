There are also a jumble of boxes filled with intricate, dreamy worlds to explore, vibrant block prints, and portrait etchings made from copper plates.\n\nWhen installed at the 28th annual IFPDA Fine Art Print Fair for its Oct. 23-27 run at the River Pavilion at the Javits Center in New York, Swoon\u2019s monumental artwork will evoke contemporary printmaking as a living, breathing art form.\n\nIt\u2019s a message central to this year\u2019s fair under the IFPDA\u2019s new director, Jenny Gibbs, who was determined to show that printmaking is not art of the past, but that in fact, \u201call the cool kids make prints.\u201d\n\nSwoon is definitely a cool kid. As the first female artist to be recognized as a major street artist, Swoon would paste paper portraits to the sides of buildings in New York City. She saw her work as making the city more accessible, and she wanted to \u201clet them deteriorate and to see that process happen,\u201d she says.\n\nBlock print detail from Swoon's upcoming IFPDA Fine Art Print Fair installation Swoon\n\nSwoon\u2019s interest in reproduction and change continues to inform her art, \u201citerating things and mutating them and learning from that,\u201d as she puts it. It\u2019s why the IFPDA piece will include elements like a set of double-doors that were part of the rafts, along with other facets of her work\u2014colorful block prints, and boxes that are like \u201ca cabinet of curiosities\u201d\u2014spanning the years.\n\nMore recently, Swoon has been creating densely-detailed portraits using copper plates, a technique that dates back to the Renaissance. Four of these etchings will be central to the installation. It\u2019s that direct connection from the past to the contemporary that the IFPDA intentionally is celebrating with Swoon.\n\nThe artist\u2019s commission for the fair came about from a conversation Gibbs had with Nadine M. Orenstein, Drue Heinz Chair of Drawings and Prints at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, as a way to engage fair goers in The Met\u2019s Renaissance of Etching exhibition. The exhibition, which will open at the same time as the fair, on Oct. 23, and will run through Jan. 20, will look at the beginnings of the etched print from the first half of the sixteen century.\n\n\u201cWe started thinking about a project at the fair in which we could connect the dots, the etching with contemporary studio practice,\u201d Gibbs says. \u201cWe thought Swoon would be perfect for that.\u201d\n\nA section of Swoon's upcoming IFPDA Fine Art Print Fair installation Swoon\n\nAs Orenstein says, \u201cThe artists who first experimented with ways of making printed etchings on paper in the first decades of the 16 th century were basically using the same technique that artists use today when they create etchings.\n\n\u201cAnd artists then were using the same kind of expansive mindset that artists have today\u2014how do you take a medium meant to create black lines on white paper and push the medium to express so much more,\u201d she says. \u201cArtists were thinking creatively about that in 1510 and artists like Swoon think about it that way now.\u201d\n\nThat expansive mindset is evident in Swoon\u2019s 2018 Girl with Dappled Sunlight, a portrait of a young girl Swoon met one day and \u201cspontaneously wanted to draw.\u201d The work is created from a copper plate etching, but comes alive with a layer of silk-screen highlights.\n\nThe fair installation itself will be full of connections from the past to the present, with the left side including the etchings, and the right opening up into block printing and bright colors, \u201csomething that was definitely made today, or at least within the last 20 years,\u201d Swoon says. It will all be built around the artist\u2019s signature theme of portraiture.\n\nSwoon\u2019s more recent explorations in the art of reproducibility also will be exhibited next month at the Deitch Gallery in New York\u2019s Soho neighborhood. The gallery show will include a short stop-motion film animation and, potentially, intimate new drawings that she says won\u2019t need to be as \u201ccivic and public facing,\u201d as her street art.\n\nWhile the installation may be more \u201ccivic and public facing\u201d (in other words, no nudes), it will offer many glimpses into Swoon\u2019s world, often through people\u2014mostly real\u2014but also through the mythological. \u201cI think of myself as someone who is living their whole life through artwork,\u201d she says.", "description": "The contemporary artist Callie Curry\u2019s detailed work draws a connection to Renaissance-era printmaking", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-115385/social", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
