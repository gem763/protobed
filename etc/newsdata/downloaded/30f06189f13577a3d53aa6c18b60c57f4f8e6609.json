Instead hostile neighbours and friends of the Hughes family poured out their homes to shout abuse. One told our reporter to 'get back in your car and f*** off.'\n\nParked near Ronan's home was a lorry with C Hughes insignia.\n\nA Ronan Hughes is said to have leased the refrigerated container from Dublin-based Global Trailer Rents (GTR).\n\nHe is also linked to the blue Scania lorry impounded by Garda at Dublin Port on Saturday.\n\nMailOnline spoke to Christopher Hughes on the day the bodies were discovered but he denied he was involved.\n\nMailOnline has visited the address reportedly given on the lease document for the container by a 'Ronan Hughes'. Those at the address declined to comment\n\nAnnouncing an appeal today, Essex Detective Chief Superintendent Stuart Hooper, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Finding and speaking to the Hughes brothers is crucial to our investigation.\n\n'At this time we believe they are in Northern Ireland but they also have links to the Irish Republic.\n\n'If you know where they are or have any information about their whereabouts I need you to call my team.'\n\nLorry driver Maurice 'Mo' Robinson has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, two counts of people trafficking and one of money laundering\n\nAccording to detectives, Ronan Hughes, who also goes by the name Rowan, and his brother have links to Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\n\nIndependent Unionist councillor Paul Berry, who knows the family of lorry driver Mo Robinson, said: 'The local community must help PSNI to track these individuals down.\n\n'All individuals involved in this henious incident must all be tracked down and brought before the courts. I have no doubt the Essex Police will continue to investigate and no stone should be left unturned until these men are caught.'\n\nThe bodies of eight women and 31 men were found in a refrigerated trailer attached to a lorry in an industrial park in Grays in the early hours of last Wednesday.\n\nMo Robinson, 25, Craigavon, Northern Ireland, appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering.\n\nThree other people arrested in connection with the incident - a 38 year-old man, a 38 year-old woman, and a 46 year-old man - have all been released on bail until November.\n\nThe discovery of the bodies has sparked a huge international investigation to try and identify the victims.\n\nPham Tra My, 26, was the first person named by family as among the 39 dead in the container tragedy and it appears she may have been deported from Britain days earlier\n\nThis is the last photo of 15-year-old Nguyen Huy Hung, who has been missing since he tried to cross illegally to Britain, his family claim\n\nNguyen Van Hung's shocked family have not heard from him since October 21st when he sent a message saying he was 'going by taxi' to the UK\n\nEssex Police initially believed the 39 were all Chinese nationals, but Vietnamese men and women are feared to be among the dead.\n\nFamilies face an agonising wait to find out if their loved ones are among the dead after the force launched \"the largest mass fatality victim identification process\" in the force's history.\n\nAll of the victims have since been moved from the vehicle to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford for post-mortem examinations to be carried out.\n\nIt is not yet known when the victims entered the trailer, where temperatures can be as low as minus 25C if the fridge is activated, or the exact route it travelled.\n\nBelgian officials said the trailer arrived at Zeebrugge at 2.49pm on Tuesday and left the port the same day en route to Purfleet in Essex.\n\nThe trailer arrived at Purfleet at around 12.30am on Wednesday, and was picked up by the cab, known as the tractor, which arrived from Northern Ireland via Holyhead in North Wales on Sunday.\n\nThe lorry left the port at Purfleet shortly after 1.05am before police were called to the Waterglade Industrial Park on Eastern Avenue in Grays at 1.40am.\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, and cousins Hung Nguyen, 33, and Hoang Van Tiep, 18, (pictured left to right) are all feared to be in the container", "description": "Police say they want to speak to Ronan Hughes, 40, and his brother\u00a0Christopher, 34, both from Armagh, on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.", "authors": ["James Fielding", "Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/14/20329038-0-image-a-74_1572358372092.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
