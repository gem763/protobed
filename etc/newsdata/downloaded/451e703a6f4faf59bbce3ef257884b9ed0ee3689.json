He added that al-Qaeda elements hostile to ISIS were active in the region.\n\n\u201cThis organization has always unhesitatingly killed Islamic State fighters on the spot as key rivals for power in Syria,\u201d Konashenkov said. \u201cBearing this in mind, the US or other participants in the operation should at least provide direct evidence that the former Islamic State leader had been safely staying on a territory controlled by the \u2018Syrian Al Qaeda\u2019 (also outlawed in Russia).\u201d\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry referred to al-Baghdadi\u2019s death as \u201cyet another\u201d one, holding on to Russian claims that Moscow was responsible for the \u201ccaliph\u201d\u2018s death two years ago.\n\nThe Kremlin did not add to the foreign ministry statement, TASS noted.\n\nThe Turkish government\u2019s Anadolu news agency noted on Monday that Russian television outlets were towing the government\u2019s line, \u201ctaking U.S. claims of striking Islamic State targets with a grain of salt.\u201d According to Anadolu, Russian coverage of the operation condemned President Trump for using \u201cemotionally charged\u201d language to celebrate the death of al-Baghdadi, responsible for multiple genocides against ethnic and religious minorities in Syria and Iraq.\n\nAlso following Moscow\u2019s lead is coverage of the raid in Iranian state media, which has parroted what it claims are \u201clocal media sources affiliated to the Syrian dissidents.\u201d\n\n\u201cRadio Mohafezat Idlib, a telegram channel, wrote on Sunday that the house that the U.S. claims al-Baghdadi resided in with his family belonged to Commander of Horras al-Din group and he (and not Baghdadi) was killed in the attack along with his wife and 5 children,\u201d the Iranian state outlet Fars claimed. \u201cAlso, another telegram channel affiliated to the militants named Amjad al-Akhbariyeh Channel quoted an informed source as saying that the house which was attacked in Barisha region in Idlib belonged to Abu Mohammed al-Halabi, non de guerre Abu al-Bara, one of the commanders of Horras al-Din.\u201d\n\nFars provided no evidence to back any of these claims.\n\nThe SITE Intelligence Agency noted on Sunday that among those doubting the veracity of Trump\u2019s claims are al-Baghdadi\u2019s followers, as well. Rita Katz, the agency\u2019s director, said on Twitter that \u201c[p]ro-IS groups and supporters online are already disputing the reports- likening news of the death/capture of Baghdadi to a \u2018broken record,\u2019 and calling on other supporters to \u2018persevere and prepare, because you will be hearing this a lot.'\u201d\n\nPresident Trump announced al-Baghdadi\u2019s death on Sunday morning. Al-Baghdadi was the \u201ccaliph\u201d of the declared Islamic State, which at its peak contained a population of millions spanning Syria and Iraq, including the latter\u2019s second-largest city, Mosul. ISIS fighters attempted genocide against the Christians, Kurds, Yazidis, Shiite Muslims, and other minorities of the region and welcomed an influx of Sunni jihadists from all over there world, which entered the \u201ccaliphate\u201d mostly through the porous Turkish border.\n\n\u201cLast night, the United States brought the world\u2019s number one terrorist leader to justice,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nTrump announced that al-Baghdadi died \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\u201d detonating a suicide bomb that killed three of his children. Only one American, a canine officer, was harmed in the operation. A U.S. official confirmed Monday that the dog is healthy and has returned to service.\n\nTrump thanked the Russian government for its help in executing the operation, as well as Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and allied Syrian Kurdish forces. The Kurds confirmed the kill on Sunday, noting that they had worked with Washington for five months to plan al-Baghdadi\u2019s capture.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Russia's Defense Ministry claimed it had \"no reliable information\" that the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died on Sunday.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/04/Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi-islamic-state-caliph-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
