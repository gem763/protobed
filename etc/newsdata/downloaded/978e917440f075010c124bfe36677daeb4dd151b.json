Yes, the Trump administration held up military aid for a vulnerable ally, and yes, the Republican president pressed Ukraine to pursue partisan conspiracy theories, but Trump didn\u2019t necessarily draw a connection between the two.\n\nThat argument has always been ridiculous. As of this afternoon, it\u2019s also been rejected \u2013 by the Trump White House.\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has a message for those concerned that President Donald Trump held up military aid to Ukraine until they moved to investigate a conspiracy involving the 2016 U.S. election \u2013 \u201cGet over it.\u201d In speaking with reporters Thursday at the White House, Mulvaney acknowledged Trump held up Ukraine aid partly for political reasons. \u201cGet over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d he added.\n\nBy Mulvaney\u2019s telling, Trump specifically wanted Ukraine to explore questions \u201crelated to the DNC server\u201d \u2013 a line of inquiry most fair-minded observers recognize as a crackpot conspiracy theory \u2013 as part of a White House quid pro quo. That, of course, is a quid pro quo that Republicans just spent weeks denying the existence of.\n\nWhen a reporter explained to the acting White House chief of staff that he\u2019d \u201cjust described a quid pro quo,\u201d Mulvaney replied, \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nIt was moments later when the South Carolina Republican added, \u201cI have news for everybody. Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), \u201cMr. Mulvaney\u2019s acknowledgment means that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.\u201d\n\nBy way of a defense, the acting White House chief of staff tried to explain why everyone should see what Trump did as routine. Pointing to aid for Central American countries as an example, Mulvaney said, \u201cWe were holding up money at the same time for, what was it, the Northern Triangle countries. We were holding up aid at the Northern Triangle countries so that they would change their policies on immigration.\u201d\n\nWhether Mulvaney recognizes these details or not, it\u2019s important to understand the qualitative differences. When the United States tells a foreign country that its aid is dependent on a specific policy outcome, it\u2019s easy to make the case that an administration is using its leverage trying to advance our national interests.\n\nThe difference in the case of Trump and Ukraine is that the American president tried to use his leverage to advance his own interests.\n\nFor Team Trump to engage in such corruption is extraordinary. For Team Trump to confess to such corruption is breathtaking.\n\nLooking ahead, Mulvaney put at the core of his argument that the quid pro quo was retrospective, not prospective: Trump used his leverage to focus on 2016, the argument goes, not 2020. By this reasoning, Mulvaney\u2019s confession, for lack of a better word, doesn\u2019t include an acknowledgement that the president is seeking foreign assistance in next year\u2019s U.S. election.\n\nThe trouble with this tack, of course, is that Trump stood on the South Lawn of the White House and called for foreign governments to go after Joe Biden. For that matter, it\u2019s likely that the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry is hearing from a whole bunch of witnesses who are likely to provide evidence that shows Trump\u2019s scheme was obviously about Biden.", "description": "For weeks, Republicans said Trump's Ukraine scandal lacked a quid pro quo.
