[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nGUANGZHOU-Hong Kong resident Andy Ng was surprised his shared workspace Timetable was rented out completely only six months after it had started operation in Guangzhou, Guangdong province.\n\nWhile studying economics at City University of Hong Kong, Ng set up his first business, developing an online education platform, but soon realized the Hong Kong market was too small. After earning a master's degree in the UK in 2017, Ng returned to China and chose Guangzhou as his new base.\n\nTimetable is now accumulating popularity and even fans at dianping.com, China's major online consumer guide. Ng feels lucky that his business caught on during the implementation of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development plan.\n\nThe bay area, covering 56,000 square km, comprises Hong Kong and Macao as well as nine cities in Guangdong. It had a combined population of about 70 million at the end of 2017 and is one of the most open and dynamic regions in China.\n\nIn July 2017, a framework agreement on the development of the bay area was signed. On Feb 18, China issued the more specific Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. One of its major aims is to develop the area into an international innovation and technology hub.\n\nOpportunities for youth\n\nThe plan proposes that innovation and entrepreneurship resources be shared in the bay area to provide more opportunities for young Hong Kong and Macao entrepreneurs.\n\nAn incubator for entrepreneurship, Timetable is home to 52 companies, including 15 from Hong Kong and Macao, such as Redspots, a virtual reality company that was the Award of the Year winner at the Hong Kong Information and Communications Technology Awards this year.\n\n\"I persuaded them one by one to come here,\" Ng said. \"I told them of my own experience that the Greater Bay Area is a great stage for starting a business with ever-upgrading technologies, ever-changing consumer tastes and a population 10 times that of Hong Kong.\"\n\nTimetable is a startup base of the Guangzhou Tianhe Hong Kong and Macao Youth Association, which has assisted 65 enterprises founded by young people in Hong Kong and Macao since its establishment in October 2017.\n\nThe association and its four bases provide a package of services from training and registering to policy and legal consultation, said Chen Jingzhan, one of the association founders.\n\nTong Yat, a young Macao resident who teaches children's programming, is grateful the association encouraged him to come to Guangdong, where young people enjoy more preferential policies to start their own businesses.\n\n\"The Greater Bay Area development not only benefits us, but paves the way for the next generation,\" Tong said. \"If one of my students were to become a tech tycoon in the future and tell others that his first science and technology teacher was me, I would think it all worthwhile.\"\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, there were more than 980 science and technology business incubators in Guangdong, including more than 50 for young people from Hong Kong and Macao, said Wu Hanrong, an official with the Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong.\n\nInnovation highland\n\nAs young entrepreneurs create a bustling, innovative atmosphere, the Guangdong government has stepped up efforts to improve basic research capability, considered the backbone of an international innovation and technology hub, by building large scientific installations and launching provincial labs.\n\nSeveral large scientific facilities have settled in Guangdong. China Spallation Neutron Source operates in Dongguan, a neutrino observatory is under construction in Jiangmen, and a high intensity heavy-ion accelerator is being built in Huizhou.\n\nGuangdong also plans to build about 10 provincial labs, covering regenerative medicine, materials, advanced manufacturing, next-generation network communications, chemical and fine chemicals, marine research and other areas, said Zhang Yan, of the provincial department of science and technology.\n\nUnlike traditional universities or research institutions, the provincial labs enjoy a high degree of autonomy in policy and spending. A market-oriented salary system allows them to recruit talent from all over the world, and researchers from other domestic organizations can work for the laboratories without giving up their original jobs, Zhang said.\n\nThe labs are also open to professionals from Hong Kong and Macao. Research teams from the universities of the two special administrative regions have been involved in many of the key programs, Zhang said.\n\nFor example, the provincial lab of regenerative medicine and health has jointly established a regenerative medicine research institute with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, a heart research center with the University of Hong Kong, and a neuroscience research center with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nGuangdong has been trying to break down institutional barriers to help cooperation by encouraging Hong Kong and Macao research institutions to participate in provincial research programs, exploring the cross-border use of provincial government-sponsored research funds.\n\nNansha focus\n\nLocated at the center of the bay area, Guangzhou's Nansha district is designed as the national economic and technological development zone and national free trade zone, and is an important pivot in building the area into an international innovation and technology hub.\n\nThe construction of a science park covering about 200 hectares started on Sept 26. Gong Shangyun, an official with the Nansha government, said the park will be completed in 2022.\n\nJointly built by the Guangzhou government and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the science park will accommodate CAS research institutes from around Guangzhou, including the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, the South China Botanical Garden and the Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion.\n\nRen Hai, director of the botanical garden, is looking forward to expanding the research platforms in Nansha.\n\n\"We will build a new economic plant platform serving the green development of the Pearl River Delta as well as a new botanical garden open to the public, and we will promote the establishment of the Greater Bay Area and botanical garden union,\" Ren said.\n\nWang Ying, a researcher with the botanical garden, said the union will help deepen the long cooperation among its members and improve scientific research, science popularization and ecological protection.\n\n\"Predecessors of our botanical garden have helped counterparts in Hong Kong and Macao gradually establish their regional flora since the 1950s and 1960s,\" Wang said.\n\nHong Kong University of Science and Technology also started to build a new campus in Nansha the same day as the science park broke ground. \"Located next to the high-speed rail station, the Guangzhou campus is only a 30-minute journey from the Hong Kong campus. A delegation from the HKUST once paid a visit to the site and found it very convenient to work here,\" Gong said.\n\nCarrie Lam Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, hoped the new campus would help create a new avenue for exchanges and cooperation on higher education between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, and cultivate more innovative talent.\n\nNansha's layout is a miniature of the provincial blueprint for an emerging international innovation and technology hub.\n\n\"We are seeking partnerships with other leading domestic research institutions and encouraging universities from Hong Kong and Macao to set up research and development institutions in Guangdong,\" said Zhang Kaisheng, an official with the provincial department of science and technology.\n\n\"We are much busier now because research institutes at home and abroad come to talk about collaboration every week,\" Zhang said. \"The Greater Bay Area is a rising attraction to global scientific researchers.\"\n\nXinhua", "description": "GUANGZHOU-Hong Kong resident Andy Ng was surprised his shared workspace Timetable was rented out completely only six months after it had started operation in Guangzhou, Guangdong province.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9d6df5a310cf3e97a044c0.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
