It\u2019s public. If you truly want something to remain 100% private then I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve got to take a leaf out of Osama bin Laden\u2019s book and view all electronic communication, and social media in particular, as a clear and present danger to your privacy.\u2019\n\nPiers Morgan has some thoughts (Picture: Rex)\n\nWriting for the Mail Online, he added: \u2018I only completely trust about 20 people in the entire world, including close family members and long-time friends. They are the people I know for sure would never let me down, and who would get out of bed at 4am to help me if I was in trouble.\n\n\u2018Yet I have 412 \u2018friends\u2019 on my personal Facebook account, the only private social media account I run. These include former work colleagues, newer friends, distant family and various celebrities, none of whom I would completely trust.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s not to denigrate them, or impune their honour, it\u2019s just a reality check that if I suddenly posted something surprising like \u201cHi everyone, I\u2019m gay and planning to announce my forthcoming civil partnership with David Hasselhoff on live TV tomorrow\u201d, I would expect that revelation to become public in about three nano-seconds, possibly sooner.\u2019\n\nColleen Rooney accused Rebekah Vardy of selling stories to the press (Instagram)\n\nRebekah and Coleen became pals as their husbands played alongside each other for England.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, on Wednesday Coleen sent shockwaves through the media when she alleged Rebekah had been selling fake stories about the Rooneys to newspapers.\n\n\u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper,\u2019 shared Coleen.\n\n\u2018And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house. \u2018\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to,\u2019 she concluded.\n\n\u2018Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
