Kurdish officials said after fighters and civilians have cleared out of the town, Ras al-Ayn, Kurdish-led forces also will pull out of a broader section of northern Syria along Turkey's border. The withdrawal is supposed to be completed by late Tuesday, when the ceasefire is scheduled to expire. Turkey launched its military operation into the region after President Trump said he was pulling out U.S. troops who had fought alongside the Kurds against the Islamic State. Turkey views the Kurds as terrorists, and is demanding a terrorist-free \"safe zone\" along its border. [The Associated Press]\n\n2.\n\nDemonstrators set fire to buses and subway stations and clashed with police in Chile on Sunday as the South American nation faced its worst unrest in decades. More than 1,400 people have been arrested. Eight people died in fires \u2014 three at supermarkets that were looted, and five at a garment factory that allegedly was burned by rioters. The demonstrations over living costs erupted two weeks ago in response to a planned subway fare hike. President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era canceled the fare increase on Saturday, but the violence continued. A state of emergency was declared in the capital, Santiago, and five other cities. About 5,000 travelers were stranded at Santiago's airport overnight as at least two airlines canceled or rescheduled flights. The country is bracing for a national strike called for Monday. [The New York Times, BBC News]\n\n3.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Sunday that \"in the next few weeks\" she will release a plan for how to pay for her Medicare-for-all goal. Democratic presidential rivals have been attacking Warren on her refusal to specify how she proposes to fund the plan, and reporters continue to ask her if she would raise taxes, not just lower total health-care costs, for the middle class. \"Right now, the cost estimates on Medicare-for-all vary by trillions and trillions of dollars. And the different revenue streams for how to fund it \u2014 there are a lot of them,\" Warren said. \"So this is something I've been working on for months and months and it's got just a little more work until it's finished.\" [The Washington Post, USA Today]\n\n4.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pushing for a \"meaningful vote\" on his Brexit deal Monday afternoon, after Parliament denied one he asked for on Saturday. Johnson's government sent the European Union an unsigned letter as required under newly passed legislation requesting a delay on Britain's departure from the EU, currently scheduled for Oct. 31, but he also sent a signed letter presenting all of the reasons he sees for going ahead with Brexit as planned. One of Johnson's most senior ministers on Sunday reiterated that the government is still moving ahead with plans to leave the trading bloc without a delay. \"We are going to leave by Oct. 31,\" said Michael Gove, the minister leading Brexit preparations. \"We have the means and the ability to do so.\" [Reuters, The Washington Post]\n\n5.\n\nPresident Trump was surprised by the bipartisan opposition to his now-rescinded decision to host next year's Group of 7 summit at his Doral resort near Miami, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday. \"At the end of the day, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business,\" Mulvaney said, \"and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world and he wanted to put on the absolute best show, the best visit that he possibly could and he was very confident of doing that at Doral.\" Trump had promised to do the event \"at cost.\" Critics had accused Trump of trying to use his position for his own financial benefit by filling up rooms that would otherwise be mostly empty during South Florida's sweltering off-season summer. [Reuters]\n\n6.\n\nCanadians go to the polls Monday to elect a new Parliament, and polls suggest that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could become the first Canadian leader in 84 years to be ousted after one four-year term. Polls show Trudeau's Liberal Party neck-and-neck with the Conservative Party and its leader, Andrew Scheer, though it seems likely neither party will win an outright majority of Parliament's 338 seats. If the election results in Canada's first coalition government since 1972, the likely combinations would be Trudeau being joined by the New Democratic Party, and the Conservatives pairing up with the separatist Bloc Quebecois. Preliminary results are expected Monday night.
