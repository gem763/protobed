Holdings' (MDC) Q3 Earnings?", "language": "en", "text": "M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC is scheduled to report third-quarter 2019 results on Oct 30, after the market closes.\n\n\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the company\u2019s earnings and revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.3% and 2%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, its bottom line declined 15%. Total revenues (including Financial Services revenues) were also down 2.5% from the year-ago level. This downside was caused by decrease in the average selling price or ASP of homes delivered.\n\n\n\nMarkedly, the company\u2019s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, resulting in average positive surprise of 2.6%.\n\n\n\nHow are Estimates Faring?\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release.\n\n\n\nFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been stable at 87 cents over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates an increase of 1.2% from 86 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues are expected to be $779 million, suggesting a 0.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure of $$785.6 million.\n\nM.D.C. Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nM.D.C. Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise More\n\nM.D.C. Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\n\n\nM.D.C. Holdings\u2019 lower revenues and earnings, mainly due to the ongoing U.S. housing market uncertainties, are expected to get reflected in third-quarter 2019 results. Although declining mortgage rates and lower housing prices are expected to have increased traffic in the quarter, lower conversion of that traffic to sign purchase contracts is likely to have weighed on its revenues.\n\n\n\nThe company expects backlog conversion ratio (home deliveries divided by beginning backlog) for the third quarter in the 39-41% range. The metric was 40% a year ago. Lower ASPs are expected to have hurt its top line. The company anticipates ASP to decrease between 5% and 10% sequentially in the third quarter. This is largely due to mix, including the continued increase in the percentage of closings coming from more affordable product lines.\n\n\n\nIn addition to lower revenues, higher SG&A expenses are expected to have weighed on its third-quarter earnings.\n\n\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Says\n\n\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for M.D.C.
