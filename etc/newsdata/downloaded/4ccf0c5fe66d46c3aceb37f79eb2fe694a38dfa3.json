They can be annoying, especially to those who don\u2019t understand them. But far from being undesirable pests, the caucuses perform a valuable function not only to our state but to the country. There\u2019s a kind of nobility in their persistence, despite the best efforts of many powerful people to crush them into the dust.\n\nUsually, the threat comes from other states, which perennially try to push their way into the early rounds of voting. They rely on the slippery notion that their votes \u201cwon\u2019t matter\u201d if held later in the year. (Never mind that in 2016, it took until June for Hillary Clinton to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. All but seven states and the District of Columbia had voted by then.) Iowa has always dodged these predictable sorties by simply moving the caucuses as early as necessary to stay first in line.\n\nDNC tries to fix what isn't broken\n\nThis time, it\u2019s the Democratic National Committee that has attempted to snare the caucuses with a Catch-22 rules process. The DNC required Iowa, and other caucus states, to come up with an absentee \u201cvoting\u201d process. The goal \u2014 and it is a worthy goal \u2014 was to expand participation and prevent the disenfranchisement of people who might be prevented from participating by their jobs, mobility issues, overseas military service or other conflicts.\n\nChange has happened before: The Electoral College isn't set in stone. Texas, Wisconsin could be next to switch sides.\n\nAbsentee voting has long posed a bugaboo for the Iowa caucuses that does not exist for other caucus states. That\u2019s partly because in order to maintain its first-in-the-nation status, Iowa must avoid trespassing on New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary election. Any new process that looks too much like a primary election in the view of New Hampshire\u2019s secretary of state will push the two states into a showdown. Nevertheless, Iowa Democrats made a good-faith effort to create a way to expand participation while maintaining the nature of the caucuses.\n\nMore than 50 people gathered to see presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke at Kerps Tavern on Thursday morning. More\n\nThe problem, as you may have read, is that the DNC has said it would reject Iowa\u2019s plan for \u201cvirtual\u201d telephonic caucus meetings. The committee issued a vague security concern about a potential vendor and apparently decided if that not-even-hired vendor couldn\u2019t conduct a secure telephonic process, no one could. It sounds like a flimsy excuse. People manage to conduct their banking over the phone; a telephonic caucus should not pose any greater risk. Furthermore, the committee offered no such objection to Iowa\u2019s pilot project in 2016 to conduct a telephonic caucus for overseas military personnel.\n\nCaucuses are not elections\n\nThe DNC\u2019s concerns seem to arise from a fundamental misunderstanding of caucuses. Caucuses are NOT elections and they should not be held to the same standards for participation or even security as we would expect for an election. The only people getting elected at a caucus are delegates to a series of conventions over a period of months \u2014 plenty of time to catch and disqualify any cheaters. Caucuses do not produce an irreversible result that might put the wrong person in office.\n\nIowa and all states should do everything possible to eliminate barriers for participation in the political process. Even so, caucuses are not intended to be convenient. In fact, caucuses should be inconvenient. The entire process works the way it does because it forces voters to give up most of an evening in the middle of winter. Voters who are willing to make that much of a sacrifice for participation are also going to be willing to educate themselves about the issues and the candidates. Many of them are going to be willing to donate money or time to help get that candidate elected. It\u2019s why party-building is considered an even more important goal of caucuses than nominating candidates.", "description": "The DNC should reconsider its blanket prohibition on telephone caucuses or rethink its requirement for an absentee caucus process.", "authors": ["Kathie Obradovich", "Des Moines Register"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/C7r28ealGuTRqdC9HTWJQg--~B/aD0xODI0O3c9MjczNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_opinion_532/51da7e9627e114d6734b34ffdbf8deff", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
