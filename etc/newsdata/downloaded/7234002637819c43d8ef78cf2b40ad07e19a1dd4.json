He had to be helped off the field and did not return.\n\n\"Just running,\" Dissly told reporters after the game. \"I knew it wasn't good.\"\n\nDissly, who was targeted once and did not make a catch Sunday, was on crutches after the game with his left foot in a boot.\n\nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll called the injury \"serious\" and \"devastating.\"\n\n\"It's just unfortunate that he's going to have to miss this deal here if the tests come through like we think they will,\" Carroll said, per the Seattle Times.\n\nDissly, 23, has been one of quarterback Russell Wilson's favorite targets in the red zone. He entered Sunday's game with 23 receptions for 262 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nA fourth-round pick in 2018, Dissly caught eight passes for 156 yards and two touchdowns in four games before missing the remainder of his rookie year with a torn patellar tendon in his right knee.\n\n\"It's a big loss,\" Carroll said. \"He's been playing great football. You saw him, he was running in the open field and it just happened like Achilles do. They come out of nowhere. So really a devastating injury for him for this season. But Will has done everything he can. He has been an unbelievable Seahawk.\"\n\nThe diagnosis has not been confirmed, but Wilson spoke as if Dissly's season is indeed over.\n\n\"That was tough on Will and tough on us and tough on me,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"I've developed such a great relationship with Will. I just wanted him to keep the faith. He's had a tremendous year, and it's tough because it's back-to-back years and stuff. But I think that he's still young, and if anybody is as tough as nails it's him. There's nobody tougher that I know, and he will come back stronger and we will support him and love him.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Seattle Seahawks tight end Will Dissly suffered an apparent Achilles injury  during Sunday's 32-28 win in Cleveland.Dissly pulled up lame after running...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
