(AP) \u2014 A Maryland man pleaded guilty Monday in the slayings of five employees at an Annapolis newspaper, and a jury is expected to hear testimony next month about whether he was not responsible by reason of insanity.\n\nJarrod Ramos pleaded guilty in the 2018 massacre at the Capital Gazette newspaper. Judge Laura Ripken accepted his plea Monday afternoon.\n\nRipken said she determined that Ramos \u201cfreely, knowingly and voluntarily\u201d waived his right to a jury trial to determine his guilt or innocence.\n\nWearing green jail clothes and a long beard, Ramos stood in court and repeatedly answered \u201cthat is correct\u201d when asked by the judge whether he understood he was giving up his right to the first phase of his trial to determine whether he committed the crimes.\n\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Ramos said, when asked if he was guilty of all 23 courts in an indictment, including first-degree murder, attempted murder, assault and other charges.\n\nNewspaper employees and victims\u2019 relatives who attended the hearing held hands and wiped at tears during the proceeding in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court.\n\nRachael Pacella, a Capital Gazette staffer who survived the shooting by hiding between file cabinets and was injured while trying to escape, said Ramos\u2019 guilty plea brought a \u201cbig emotional relief\u201d for her.\n\n\u201cI definitely feel a little bit better and a little bit lighter after this plea,\u201d she said.\n\nRick Hutzell, the newspaper\u2019s editor, said he hopes Ramos\u2019 guilty plea provides some comfort to the survivors of the shootings and relatives of the five employees who were killed. But he said he doesn\u2019t know if it brings any justice.\n\n\u201cThere is no justice for the dead,\u201d Hutzell said.\n\nPhil Davis, a former Capital Gazette reporter who survived the shooting and now works as a reporter at The Baltimore Sun, told reporters outside the courthouse while the case isn\u2019t over, \u201cthere\u2019s a certain level of closure that this brings.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving to not go through this part of the trial, which would have been an argument of his guilt, certainly seems validating,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe 39-year-old Ramos had originally pleaded not guilty and not criminally responsible. The latter term is Maryland\u2019s version of an insanity defense.\n\nThe judge said at a pretrial hearing last week that a report from the state health department has found Ramos to be legally sane. Attorneys for Ramos have said experts on the defense team reached a different conclusion.\n\nUnder Maryland law, a defendant has the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he is not criminally responsible for his actions. State law says a defendant is not criminally responsible for criminal conduct if, because of a mental disorder or developmental disabilities, he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.\n\nIf Ramos were found not criminally responsible, he would be committed to a maximum-security psychiatric hospital.\n\nThe judge had granted a request from defense attorneys to hold the trial in two phases \u2014 the first to determine whether he committed the crimes and the second to decide whether he wasn\u2019t criminally responsible. The guilty pleas Monday means the case will go straight to the second phase.\n\nAccording to the state\u2019s attorney, jury selection is expected to start Wednesday. The proceeding to determine whether Ramos is criminally responsible will begin in November.\n\nAuthorities say Ramos stormed the newspaper office in June 2018 with a shotgun and killed John McNamara, Wendi Winters, Rebecca Smith, Gerald Fischman and Rob Hiaasen. It was one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in U.S. history.\n\nMuch of the rampage was captured on video surveillance, which the judge ruled earlier this month could be used at trial. The video shows Ramos testing a flashlight and laser sighting on a shotgun before he blasted his way through a locked door to begin the attack, said Anne Colt Leitess, the state\u2019s attorney prosecuting the case.\n\nLeitess recounted in a statement of facts how Ramos had sealed a back door to prevent people from escaping.\n\nSurvivors had to step over the body of Winters as authorities led them out, Leitess said. Winters had charged at Ramos with a trash can and recycling bin during the attack, Leitess added.\n\nBefore the shooting, Ramos had been accused of harassing the Capital Gazette\u2019s staff in connection with a defamation suit he filed against the newspaper in 2012, authorities have said. The suit was thrown out.\n\nPolice said Ramos was angered that the newspaper reported on his guilty plea to a misdemeanor harassment charge about a decade ago after a former high school classmate alleged he was stalking and harassing her.\n\nPolice say they arrested Ramos after the shooting as he hid under a desk in the newsroom.\n\nLeitess described how Ramos gave himself up to police.\n\n\u201cI surrender. I surrender. I\u2019m your shooter,\u201d Ramos said, according to Leitess\u2019 statement of facts.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Denise Lavoie contributed to this report from Richmond, Va.", "description": "ANNAPOLIS, Md.
