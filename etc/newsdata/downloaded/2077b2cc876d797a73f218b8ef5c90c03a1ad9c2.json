We ask the international community and the United Nations to perform their roles in this matter,\" he said.\n\nHis comments came a day after US and Iraqi officials offered apparently conflicting accounts of the fate of the US troops in the region, who have been leaving Syria as part of a withdrawal announced by President Donald Trump earlier this month.\n\nThe Iraqi military said on Tuesday that the US forces do not have permission to stay in Iraq, in a response to Esper's previous comments that Washington's troops would continue operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) armed group from Iraq to prevent its resurgence in the region.\n\nAl Jazeera's Imran Khan, reporting from Baghdad, said Baghdad's reaction appeared to had stemmed from \"the language that the US used\".\n\n\"The US said that the forces will come back to Ain al-Assad in western Iraq and mount operations against ISIL from there - and that seems to have angered the Iraqis,\" Khan said.\n\nFour-week timetable\n\nAfter meeting Esper earlier on Wednesday, Iraq's Defence Minister Najah al-Shammari said US forces withdrawing from Syria into neighbouring Iraq would depart the country within four weeks.\n\nShammari told The Associated Press news agency that the US troops were \"transiting\" in Iraq and would then head either to Kuwait or Qatar, or back to the US.\n\nEsper said on Tuesday that Washington planned to eventually bring US troops withdrawing from Syria back home. He did not provide any timelines.\n\nHe added on Wednesday that the US had no plans to leave troops in Iraq \"interminably\".\n\nCritics have charged that the US withdrawal from Syria effectively deserted the Kurdish-spearheaded Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Washington's main ally in the war against ISIL.\n\nThe move cleared the way for Turkey to launch a cross-border military operation against the SDF, which is led by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), in the northeast region of the country. Ankara considers the YPG a \"terrorist organisation\".", "description": "Adel Abdul Mahdi says Baghdad has taken 'all international legal measures' in response to US soldiers' recent entry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/06fa44b8cd1e4b73a941a2181162a87b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
