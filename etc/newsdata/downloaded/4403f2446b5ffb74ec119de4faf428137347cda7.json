So if you're not sure, don't punish them,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not saying that the five defendants didn't commit the crimes, they might have done so,\" he added.\n\n\"But the judicial process needs to be transparent and credible... punishing the wrong people makes them scapegoats.\"\n\nThe Facebook feed then cut but people in court said the judge read out a legal oath in front of the former Thai king's portrait before whipping out a pistol and shooting himself.\n\nHe was rushed to hospital where he is reported to be in a stable condition.\n\nWhy did he do it?\n\nIt is not fully clear why Judge Pianchana attempted to take his own life.\n\nSuriyan Hongvilai, the spokesman of the Office of the Judiciary, told the AFP news agency he shot himself due to \"personal stress\".\n\nBut local media reported that the judge could have been referring to the case he had just ruled on.\n\nA statement believed to have been written by the judge and posted to Facebook before he shot himself stated that he had been pressured to find the men guilty despite lack of evidence.\n\n\"At this moment, other fellow judges in Courts of First Instance across the country are being treated the same way as I was,\" he wrote.\n\n\"[If] I cannot keep my oath of office, I'd rather die than live without honour.\"\n\nCriticism of the judicial system by judges is extremely rare in Thailand.\n\nRights groups have alleged that security forces trump up charges against Muslim suspects in the Malay-Muslim majority region.", "description": "The judge gave a speech calling for a fairer judiciary before shooting himself in the chest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1426D/production/_109114528_mediaitem109114527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
