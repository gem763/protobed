He had earlier set out his decision to quit as an MP at the next general election\n\nMr Stewart, pictured in Downing Street in June, will contest the 2020 mayoral election as an independent candidate\n\nMr Stewart's decision to run to be London Mayor represents a potentially major headache for the Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey.\n\nMr Stewart's candidacy could risk splitting the Tory vote but Mr Khan is also likely to be wary of the impact the MP could have on the race given his moderate and pro-EU credentials.\n\nMr Khan secured his first four-year term in 2016 after he beat Tory challenger Zac Goldsmith by 57 per cent to 43 per cent.\n\nMr Khan would have been bullish about his chances of securing a second term with Mr Bailey's campaign having struggled to make much of an impact.\n\nBut the arrival of Mr Stewart into the race could make the battle for City Hall the most unpredictable since the role of mayor was created in 2000.\n\nMr Stewart wasted no time in taking aim at Mr Khan as he wrote in the Evening Standard: 'We are suffering from a real lack of leadership, and of strong and thoughtful action.'\n\nA spokesman for Mr Khan said: 'London is open and Sadiq welcomes all challenges. The most important thing in this election is that London chooses a Mayor committed to stopping Brexit and standing up for London\u2019s values in the shadow of the huge cuts imposed by the Tory government.'\n\nMr Stewart's decision to walkaway from Parliament prompted his supporters and allies to express their regret at the move.\n\nAmber Rudd, who quit the Tories to sit as an independent after 21 of her colleagues were expelled, said before Mr Stewart's mayoral candidacy announcement: 'What a loss to politics. An outstanding MP & Minister. One of the strongest speakers in Parliament.\n\n'Principled, patient, thoughtful. I feel certain he\u2019ll be back.'\n\nMr Stewart hinted at his intention to quit the Tories at an event at the Royal Albert Hall last night as he read out a letter from Eton College to Boris Johnson's father which was sent in 1982.\n\nThe letter addressed a schoolboy Mr Johnson's apparently 'disgracefully cavalier' attitude to his classical studies and took aim at his 'gross failure of responsibility'.\n\nA seemingly joking Mr Stewart prompted laughter as he said reading the letter 'constitutes my resignation from the Conservative Party'.\n\nThere had been mounting speculation in recent weeks that Mr Stewart could try to form a new political party along the lines of the En Marche! movement created by Emmanuel Macron in France.\n\nBut his statement that he will run as an independent candidate at the mayoral election in May next year appears to rule that out at least for the moment.\n\nMr Stewart made it down to the last five in the battle to replace Mrs May despite having started the contest as a rank outsider.\n\nSadiq Khan, the current Mayor of London pictured in Brighton in September, is hoping to secure a second term when the capital goes to the polls next year\n\nHis ability to stay in the battle for the keys to 10 Downing Street surprised many because he campaigned on a firm anti-No Deal ticket as he also accused his fellow candidates of adopting unrealistic Brexit positions.\n\nHe also repeatedly attacked the frontrunner Mr Johnson who he claimed would end up 'letting down' his supporters.\n\nHis campaigning style raised eyebrows as he embarked on a series of 'Rory Walks' events as he journeyed across the nation to talk to voters.\n\nHe documented his efforts on social media as his online following surged.\n\nWhen Mr Johnson became Prime Minister, Mr Stewart was one of a number of pro-Remain Cabinet ministers to quit the government in order to deprive the premier of the chance to sack them.\n\nMr Johnson had made clear during the race that all of his ministers would have to agree to the option of a No Deal Brexit - something Mr Stewart said he could not sign up to.\n\nSince his decision to walk away from the government, Mr Stewart has been a constant thorn in the side of the PM.\n\nHe has become one of the leading figures in the so-called Remain Alliance which has tried to stop Mr Johnson from taking the UK out of the EU without an agreement.\n\nTensions came to a head at the start of September when Mr Stewart was one of 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the party whip after backing a bid to block a chaotic split from Brussels on October 31.\n\nThe 21 rebels were then forced to sit as independents in the House of Commons but they retained their membership of the Conservative Party.\n\nA number of the rebels are fighting to have the whip restored but Mr Stewart's decision to resign from the party suggests that he believes there is no way back for him.\n\nHis decision to quit also makes him the second Tory leadership challenger to ditch the party in recent months after Sam Gyimah defected to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nMr Stewart was first elected to the Commons back in 2010 as he won his Penrith and the Border constituency with a majority of just over 11,000.\n\nHe went onto increase his majority in 2015 to almost 20,000 before seeing it dip to just under 16,000 in 2017.\n\nThe battle to be selected as the new Tory candidate for the area will be fiercely contested as it is viewed as a Conservative safe seat.", "description": "Rory Stewart today announced he will run as an independent candidate to be Mayor of London after he revealed he is standing down as an MP and has resigned from the Conservative Party.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19292884-0-image-a-41_1570185117295.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
