Much of the lawsuit focuses on Stefan Krause, who stepped away from the CEO role at Canoo in August for personal reasons. Stefan Krause filed for divorce from Christina Krause in July 2019.\n\nUlrich Kranz, originally the company\u2019s CTO, has since taken over the day-to-day operations of Canoo. Stefan Krause remains at the company and is focused on fundraising, according to a spokesperson. His current title is chairman of the Advisory Board.\n\nThe lawsuit also reveals more details about Canoo \u2014 originally named Evelozcity \u2014 its investors and how it has scaled in a just a few years time.\n\nSome of the nuggets that stood out, include its origin story and rapid growth. The company was founded in late 2017, after a meeting in Hong Kong with Pak Tam \u201cDavid\u201d Li and David Stern, who would become investors in Canoo, according to the lawsuit. Canoo has never revealed the names of its primary investors. Stern is a German entrepreneur who the lawsuit also lists as a friend of Stefan Krause. Stern is listed as a director to UK incubator Pitch@Palace and as consultant for Celestial Limited.\n\nLi, Stern and Stefan Krause made a \u201cgentlemen\u2019s agreement\u201d to start an EV company at the conclusion of the meeting and Christina Krause was tasked with securing talent and performing other administrative tasks related to the formation of a new company, the lawsuit says. The meeting with Li and Stern occurred around the same time that Stefan Krause left his job as CFO of the troubled company Faraday Future .\n\nThe company launched a month later, and by December it had 10 founding employees. Nine of those became co-founders. Christina Krause alleges in the lawsuit that she was the only one excluded from the founder designation status because her \u201crole wasn\u2019t critical for the building of the car.\u201d She was also allegedly told that it would be \u201cdistasteful\u201d for the wife of a co-founder to also receive the same designation and get an equity stake.\n\nBy March 2018, just four months since its official formation, Canoo had more than 100 employees. That number spiked again to 200 by September, 300 by March 2019 and now reaches more than 400, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAs the company scaled, the relationship between Christina and Stefan Krause deteriorated. It hit a new low in March 2019 when Stefan Krause allegedly asked his wife to agree to a postnuptial agreement, which would presumably handle how shares of Canoo would be divided in the event of a divorce. The lawsuit alleges that Stefan Krause, Stern and Krantz pressured Christina Krause to sign the agreement.\n\nCanoo has completed the design and engineering of its vehicle and is now preparing it for production through an unnamed contract manufacturer based in Michigan. The first cars are slated to appear on the road by 2021.", "description": "Just weeks after\u00a0Canoo took the wraps off of its electric vehicle, the Los Angeles-based startup and co-founder Stefan Krause has been accused of gender and marital discrimination, harassment, breach of contract, and wrongful termination in a lawsuit filed Tuesday.
