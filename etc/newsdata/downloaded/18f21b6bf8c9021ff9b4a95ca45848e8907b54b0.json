We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday she is rejecting calls by President Donald Trump and his GOP allies to hold a full vote on whether to authorize an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAfter meeting with Democratic lawmakers in a closed-door meeting, Pelosi said it was not necessary to take the additional step on a probe that is already well under way.\n\n\"There's no requirement that we have a vote,\" Pelosi said. \"We're not here to call bluffs. We're here to find the truth to uphold the Constitution of the United States. This is not a game for us. This is deadly serious.\"\n\nTrump has vowed not to cooperate with the inquiry unless the House holds a vote to officially launch it. Democrats in turn had considered holding such a vote, potentially in case courts said such a move was necessary to compel administration officials and other potential witnesses in the investigation to provide documents and appear for testimony.\n\nBut Pelosi and Democratic leaders said they've been able to secure testimony and records so far without a formal vote.\n\nPelosi announced the start of the impeachment inquiry last month into whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate matters that would help him politically, including Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe complaint: Whistleblower says Trump used 'the power of his office' to solicit foreign help to discredit Joe Biden\n\nThe Constitution gives the House the \"sole power of impeachment\" and offers few details on how the process should take place.\n\nBut Trump and congressional Republicans have argued that the impeachment is illegitimate without a formal vote.\n\nDemocratic Speaker of the House from California Nancy Pelosi announces that the House will not yet hold a formal vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry against President Trump on Oct. 15, 2019. (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA-EFE)\n\nA number of polls have shown a shift in public opinion when it comes to impeachment, including a Fox News poll released last week showing more than half of Americans support both impeaching and removing Trump from office.\n\nSenate trial: Mitch McConnell: Senate would have 'no choice' but to hold trial if House votes to impeach Donald Trump\n\nHouse Democrats are investigating allegations, made by an unidentified whistleblower, that Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nIn a July 25 call, Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter, who once had business interests in Ukraine.\n\nTrump has argued that his conversation with Zelensky was \"perfect\" and that he did nothing improper.\n\nSince Pelosi formally announced the impeachment inquiry last month, the three congressional panels leading the probe \u2013 the House Oversight, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees \u2013 have moved quickly, issuing subpoenas for documents and testimony.\n\nThis week alone, five officials wrapped up in the matter were scheduled to appear for private questioning.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/15/impeachment-nancy-pelosi-says-house-vote-inquiry/3934394002/", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House of Representatives would not hold a full vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Christal Hayes", "Ledyard King", "Published P.M.
