And we hope to have over 400, but maybe as much as 500 miles.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, remarks in New York, Sept. 25\n\nMore than 200 times, President Trump has falsely claimed that his administration is building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. A barrier is being built on the southern border, but not the 30-foot-tall, concrete, 1,000-mile wall Trump promised in the 2016 campaign. Much of this barrier is simply replacement fencing.\n\nAD\n\nThis is the most repeated claim in The Fact Checker\u2019s ongoing database of Trump\u2019s false or misleading claims.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has continuously moved the goal posts on the wall. After first promising to build a wall along the border, which is 2,000 miles long, he clarified he would build a 1,000-mile wall with natural barriers covering the rest. In September, he reduced that number to 500 miles by the end of 2020.\n\nAs of Sept. 19, Customs and Border Protection said there have been 66 miles of replacement barrier built.\n\nTrump also pledged a concrete wall, but then switched to steel. So far, the new barrier has been built with steel bollards, which are hollow steel beams filled with concrete and rebar.\n\nAD\n\nDespite an evolution in the promised wall, Trump\u2019s rhetoric has stayed consistent. For months, he has tweeted images and video of the border wall to support a favorable but not fully accurate narrative. He misrepresents unaltered video \u2014 changing the details around the video to make it seem as if the initial wall he promised is being built now. The Washington Post created a guide to manipulated video to identify such misrepresentations.\n\nAD\n\nGeorge Lakoff, author, cognitive scientist and linguist, in 2018 offered a \u201ctaxonomy\u201d to decode the ways in which Trump uses Twitter to change the national conversation.\n\nTrump uses social media as a weapon to control the news cycle. It works like a charm. His tweets are tactical rather than substantive. They mostly fall into one of these four categories. pic.twitter.com/XaK8tCpRy6 \u2014 George Lakoff (@GeorgeLakoff) January 3, 2018\n\nHe said Trump\u2019s tweets about the wall fall into the preemptive framing category, meaning he is the first to frame public opinion on an important topic in the public discourse.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe frames the issue first before anyone else can,\u201d Lakoff said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically saying, \u2018I\u2019m winning as much as someone can be winning at this point.\u2019 The expression of \u2018is being built\u2019 assumes that there is a final state and that it\u2019s on the inevitable path to that final state.\u201d\n\nA study in the scientific journal PLOS One carried out linguistic analysis of Trump\u2019s major communicative styles on Twitter from May 2009 to February 2018, which included almost 22,000 posts. Isobelle Clarke, the co-researcher on the study, plotted several of Trump\u2019s tweets showing images and video of the wall onto the dimensions from the study. She found that some of Trump\u2019s tweets are associated with the \u201ccampaigning style.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese tweets draw an us-versus-them dichotomy (our country versus the Democrats), and such a strategy is common when campaigning, as one positively presents the self and negatively presents the other in order to win the vote,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nAD\n\nShe also found that several of the tweets are \u201cdisengaged,\u201d which means they don\u2019t engage with other opinions and state things as \u201cmatters of fact, which the account often employs to deflect criticism.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy not engaging with other people\u2019s critique, the account directs the attention to other things, often things that appeal to the electorate,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThe disengaged tweets are all emphasizing very categorically that progress is being made on the wall.\u201d\n\nTrump is using his reach on Twitter to promote his message on the border wall. Images and video can create a powerful effect online in convincing American voters of the wall\u2019s progress. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build a wall probably will remain a significant focal point of the 2020 election. If history is any indication, he\u2019ll tweet about it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWatch our Fact Checker video above to learn more about how Trump misrepresents the border wall through the images and videos he posts.\n\n(The video is part of a YouTube series from The Fact Checker.
