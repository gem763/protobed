Washington third baseman Anthony Rendon\u2019s .338 mark tops the league\n\n\u201cI try not to think about it because there is still a lot of baseball left,\u201d Reynolds said before smiling and adding, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard not to think about it when it comes up in every interview.\u201d\n\nElias Diaz started the winning rally with a leadoff homer against Jose Urena (4-8) that drew the Pirates within a run. It was just the backup catcher\u2019s second home run of the season.\n\n\u201cThat really provided a lift,\u201d Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said.\n\nPinch-hitter Kevin Kramer walked and went to third on Adam Frazier\u2019s double before Reynolds flared a single into left-center to give the Pirates their fifth win in six games.\n\nIt was the first game-ending hit of Reynolds\u2019 nascent career.\n\n\u201cI like to hit in those situations with the game on the line and I\u2019ve had a couple of other chances this year when I didn\u2019t come through, so it feels good to finally do it,\u201d said Reynolds, who could not recall his last walk-off hit.\n\nFrazier and Reynolds both had two hits at the top of the order. Making just his 10th start in center field with Starling Marte getting the night off, Reynolds also turned in a pair of outstanding diving catches.\n\nGarrett Cooper\u2019s two-run homer off Kyle Crick with two outs in the seventh put the Marlins ahead 5-3.\n\nMiami\u2019s Starlin Castro had four hits, all for extra bases, as he homered and doubled three times. Cooper also had a double among his three hits.\n\n\u201cCoop and Star put on a show all day,\u201d Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. \u201cKind of a dynamic duo all day long. It\u2019s just unfortunate in a game like that, it ends quickly.\u201d\n\nWei-Chung Wang (2-0) pitched a scoreless ninth.\n\nMarlins rookie Robert Dugger was in line for his first major league win after allowing three runs - two earned - over six innings in his third career start.\n\nPirates starter Trevor Williams basically matched Dugger\u2019s line as he gave up three runs - two earned - and seven hits in six innings, though he had six strikeouts and one walk.\n\n\u201cWe were able to hang in there and keep things close and give Bryan Reynolds the opportunity to do Bryan Reynolds things,\u201d said Williams, who referred to the 24-year-old as \u201can emerging superstar.\u201d\n\nCastro\u2019s two-run homer in the fifth put Miami ahead 3-1. Pittsburgh tied it on Frazier\u2019s run-scoring triple in the fifth and pinch-hitter Pablo Reyes\u2019 RBI double in the sixth.\n\nJosh Bell drove in the Pirates\u2018 first run with a first-inning single.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPirates: Rookie OF Jason Martin will miss the rest of the season after dislocating his left shoulder Tuesday night when Marlins RHP Jarlin Garcia fell on him during a play at the plate. Martin, though, will not require surgery. \u2026 RHP Mitch Keller (bruised right wrist) played catch a day after being struck by a line drive. \u2026 RF Gregory Polanco (left shoulder inflammation) will undergo a series of platelet-rich plasma injections. He won\u2019t play again this season. \u2026 SS Kevin Newman missed his third straight start with a right hip injury but flied out as a pinch-hitter in the sixth.\n\nROSTER MOVES\n\nThe Pirates recalled Kramer, a utility player, from Triple-A Indianapolis and placed RHP Keone Kela on the paternity list. Kela is expected to miss three games.\n\nTHE FIRST TIME\n\nMarlins C Tyler Heineman made his major league debut in the eighth and struck out as a pinch-hitter. His brother Scott, an outfielder with the Texas Rangers, played in his first career game Monday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarlins: RHP Elieser Hernandez (3-5, 5.06 ERA) is scheduled to pitch Thursday night\u2019s series finale. He is 2-1 with a 4.18 ERA in his last five starts.\n\nPirates: RHP Dario Agrazal (4-5, 4.50) has won his last two starts despite giving up seven runs in 10 innings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bryan Reynolds has a chance to make history, though he isn't making a big deal about it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/marlins_pirates_baseball_40917_c0-140-3330-2081_s1770x1032.jpg?a726223bd17dc17edb5d2665e6dd314b6be8dc0e"}
