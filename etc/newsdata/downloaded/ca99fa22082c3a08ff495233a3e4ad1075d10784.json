Luck\u2019s decision was momentous. He told fans that he was retiring from professional football. Djokovic\u2019s decision was limited to the U.S. Open. In the midst of his fourth-round match against Stan Wawrinka, Djokovic announced that the pain in his injured shoulder would not allow him to continue.\n\nSports fans are notoriously fickle, but the booing of Luck and Djokovic reflects more than fickleness. It is part of a cultural change in fan expectations. Fans are increasingly angry when star athletes let their personal lives (even when they involve health issues) interfere with their professional lives.\n\nThe Nate Silver of Sports Injuries\n\nThe wealth\u2014widely reported these days\u2014of athletes at the top of their profession has made it difficult for fans to identify or sympathize with them. Luck, at just 29, has made more than $97 million since entering the National Football League in 2012, and Djokovic, who is 32, has career earnings that total over $100 million.\n\nThe psychological distance fans feel from the players has been compounded by watching the players in action from a distance. The best seats in most sports venues are typically bought up by corporations and the wealthy. Most fans sit far from the field of play and rely on stadium Jumbotrons to show them close-ups of the action.\n\nPulling for a hometown favorite in football or a personal favorite in tennis remains a motive for many, but increasingly it is not just a favorite whom fans are rooting for. They are rooting for the team or individual player they have wagered on. Legalized sports gambling, aided by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 decision striking down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, is on the rise. Electronic betting and games with substantial payoffs, like Fantasy Football, are now widespread. When a player such as Luck retires or a Djokovic withdraws from competition, there is a good chance that he is costing a fan who bet on him money.\n\nThe irony is that if any two professional athletes have given their fans grounds for identifying with them rather than resenting them, it is Luck and Djovokic.\n\nA Stanford graduate and son of a former National Football League player, Luck was a four-time Pro Bowl selection for a team that offered him little protection from opponents\u2019 defenses. Luck\u2019s list of injuries over just six years of play\u2014he missed one season entirely due to injury\u2014included a lacerated kidney, a concussion, a torn labrum in his shoulder, and most recently ankle pain that would not go away.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to live the life I want to live. It\u2019s taken the joy out of the game,\u201d Luck declared in explaining his retirement one season after being voted the National Football League\u2019s comeback player of the year. In a year in which after just four games starting NFL quarterbacks have suffered injuries ranging a concussion to a broken clavicle, Luck\u2019s decision is looking more and more like the right one.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s profile is a similar combination of success and grit. His first Grand Slam win was at the 2008 Australian Open, and from January 2015 to June 2016, he won five out of the six Grand Slams. This amazing winning streak was followed by a lengthy struggle with an elbow injury, but in 2018 he bounced back to win Wimbledon, and this year he won Wimbledon again, defeating Roger Federer in the longest finals match in the history of the tournament. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the crowd. Obviously, they came to see a full match,\u201d Djokovic observed in ending his run in this year\u2019s U.S. Open.\n\nSo far there has been no significant backlash against those who booed Luck and Djokovic. The mood of resentment that has occupied so much of our political discourse in recent years has found a place in the sports world. President Donald Trump was moving with, not against, the tide of public opinion when in 2017 in response to National Football League players taking a knee during the National Anthem in order to protest racial injustice, he told a rally of his supporters, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of those NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He\u2019s fired!\u2019\u201d", "description": "Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports/ReutersThis year, as the fall football season was beginning and the summer tennis season was drawing to a close, two of these sports\u2019 brightest stars, Andrew Luck, the Indianapolis Colts All-Pro quarterback, and Novak Djokovic, the defending U.S. Open tennis champion,", "authors": ["Nicolaus Mills"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WWvkATbJQGgJ2sLjEOIO5g--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/24068b989668e39f12d441fdd7d6abc0", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
