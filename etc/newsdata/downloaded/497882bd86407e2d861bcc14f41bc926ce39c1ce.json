By the time they came home, they were showing signs of troubling behavior \u2014 intense temper tantrums, leaving her side in public places \u2014 that took Ms. Harrison by surprise.\n\nA friend recommended the Trauma Recovery Program at the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, a child welfare organization. The program, which received a grant from The Neediest Cases Fund endowment, supports children and young adults from low-income families who have experienced interfamilial trauma or who have lived in neighborhoods where violence is common. The goal is to help them recognize trauma triggers and cope with their emotions.\n\nIn 2018, Ms. Harrison enrolled her children in the program. The experience has been eye-opening. Ms. Harrison learned that when children act out or misbehave, they are often doing so in response to emotional triggers. \u201cSeeing a bathroom, taking a bath, walking past a park,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything is a trigger.\u201d\n\nHer daughter, now 10, and son, 11, do a range of activities with their therapists. (She loves to sing and dance; he likes to play board games.) Paola Amaya, one of the program\u2019s trauma therapists, said it was essential to build trust with the children and make them feel comfortable before diving into sensitive issues. Having fun eases that process.\n\nUnlike previous therapists, the program\u2019s staff members have been able to make a connection with her children, Ms. Harrison said, because they have gotten to know them. \u201cIt was just horrible experiences prior to coming here,\u201d she said. Now the children are more communicative, opening up on their own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping,\u201d Ms. Harrison said.\n\nMs. Harrison said she wanted her children to enjoy their youth. She hopes that one day they will be able to openly discuss what they have been through without letting it define them.\n\nDonations to The Neediest Cases Fund may be made online, with a check or over the phone.", "description": "The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund kicks off its 108th annual campaign, adding Feeding America as a beneficiary.", "authors": ["Elisha Brown", "Sara Aridi"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/dining/00ncf-grants2/00ncf-grants2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
