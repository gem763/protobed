Demonstrators held signs that read \u201cWelcome rat king\u201d and \u201cTrump and the GOP are the real rats.\u201d\n\nInside the hotel, the president spoke to a friendly audience of legislators whose political futures are closely tied to how well he performs in next year\u2019s election. They greeted Trump with a chant of \"four more years\" and gave him a standing ovation when he promised to uphold the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nTrump also referenced the Democratic presidential debate that was taking place at the same time as his speech as he talked about unemployment rates for African-Americans, which he claimed were \u201cthe lowest ever recorded.\"\n\nTRUMP CLAIMS BALTIMORE RESIDENTS 'THANKING' HIM FOR TAKING ON CUMMINGS, EXPOSING 'CORRUPTION'\n\n\u201cI wonder if that would be mentioned tonight during the debate?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nDuring his speech, Trump said, \u201cThe agenda of the Democrat party is the demolition of the American middle class.\u201d He emphasized some of the biggest wins of his presidency, such as boosting military spending, slashing regulations and expanding a program that gives veterans the option to see private doctors outside the Veterans Affairs medical system.\n\n\u201cWe have done tremendous changes in our country and we are going to do a lot of other great changes,\u201d Trump said, adding that additional time is needed \u201cto hang on to what we have done\u201d and that it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d if they don\u2019t get the chance. He also stressed that it was important for the party to \u201cstick together.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to fight like hell,\u201d Trump told his legislative audience, adding that \u201cour country will go to hell if any of these people [Democrats] get in.\u201d\n\nTrump obliquely addressed his earlier insults against Baltimore, promising Republicans would \"fight for the future of cities like Baltimore that have been destroyed by decades of failed and corrupt rule.\"\n\nBaltimore, a once-gilded American seaport, has undeniable drug and violent crime challenges. The city saw more than 300 homicides in 2018 for the fourth year in a row. It also contends with deep-rooted poverty and swaths of the city are populated with vacant, boarded-up homes.\n\nIn July, the president was locked in a feud with Rep. Elijah Cummings, who represents the city's majority-black 7th Congressional District.\n\nAfter Cummings criticized Border Patrol officials during a House Oversight Committee hearing in July, Trump claimed that conditions in Baltimore were \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than those at the border, and said that \u201cno human being would ever want to live there.\u201d Democrats immediately rallied to Cummings\u2019 side, some of them accusing Trump of being racist.\n\nThe GOP retreat was scheduled to be held in Baltimore before Trump got into his dispute with Cummings. On Thursday, the president said crushing regulations, crippling taxes and \"unrestricted migration\" have undermined law enforcement and devastated America's inner cities. \"We're going to have to step up and doing something about it because we can't allow that to happen to our great cities,\" he said.\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HEAD TO CALIFORNIA IN BID TO TACKLE HOMELESSNESS\n\nTrump has not backed away from his charges that Democratic leaders are responsible for the ills of America\u2019s biggest cities. On Thursday night the president also brought up San Francisco and Los Angeles, saying \u201cwe have to step in and do something\u201d to address the homeless crisis there.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow that to happen, where major companies are leaving our cities, leaving our country, when they see that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThey are our great American cities and they are an embarrassment.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe White House said the president did not have any plans to explore Baltimore beyond his speech.\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump\u00a0told Republican lawmakers Thursday that \"sometime this year,\" he will\u00a0announce a \"substantial tax cut for middle-income folks who work so hard.\"", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
