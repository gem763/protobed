Understanding the crypto space and how you manage the risk requires a significant amount of investment and resources.\u201d\n\nThis summer, following reports of the cessation of Barclay\u2019s services to the exchange, one crypto industry commentator analyzed possible reasons for the development, noting:", "description": "U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase reinstates GBP transfers for its United Kingdom customers", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMDM3N2Y5MzI5ODU0ZjJjNTQ0ZmI4YzU0NDAxN2U0ODkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
