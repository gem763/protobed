This seems to be Masayoshi Son\u2019s approach at WeWork.\n\nThe SoftBank tech investor wants WeWork to abandon its flotation, reports the FT (\u00a3), for reasons that are not hard to guess. A listing in New York would expose the horrible truth about the allegedly hip workspace landlord. It ain\u2019t worth $47bn, the value at which SoftBank injected the last portion of its $10.5bn investment. Try $15bn-$20bn, suggests Wall Street.\n\nEven the lower range looks rich. The problem with WeWork runs deeper than the teeth-grinding corporate mission statement (\u201cA place you join as an individual, \u2018me\u2019, but where you become part of a greater \u2018we\u2019\u201d). First, there\u2019s the losses \u2013 $1.9bn last year \u2013 with more expected into the middle distance.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s the unflattering financial comparison with London-listed property group IWG, which has been in the same marketplace for years and makes real profits, but is worth a more sensible \u00a33.6bn.\n\nThird, there\u2019s an obvious risk in taking on long leases on big buildings and offering tenants short, flexible rents. In a recession, tenants may decide to trade down and forgo WeWork\u2019s funky murals and cheese-tasting events, but the landlord\u2019s lease costs would remain fixed.\n\nFourth, and perhaps most seriously, there\u2019s WeWork\u2019s breezy style of corporate governance. Co-founder Adam Neumann wasn\u2019t obviously living up to the spirit of collective endeavour when his investment vehicle was paid $5.9m by the company for the right to use the trademarked word \u201cwe\u201d. The sum has been repaid but how was the arrangement ever approved?\n\nFans may counter that the sleepy world of shared office spaces was overdue a dose of innovation and global branding. Maybe, but WeWork remains a bricks and mortar company. It is not Alibaba, the Chinese online retailer where Son made a fortune.\n\nThe flotation conundrum sets up serious tension. WeWork needs to raise $3bn-plus to keep expanding and unlock further investment. SoftBank, on the other hand, won\u2019t want to record a formal loss on its punt while it\u2019s looking to raise $100bn for its next Vision fund. It will still be in money on the early portions of its investment but any valuation for WeWork below $25bn looks likely to imply an overall loss. Even SoftBank\u2019s normally reliable Saudi backers would be unimpressed.\n\nThe rest of us, though, can cheer Wall Street\u2019s refusal to play ball. It suggests rational analysis is returning to a stock market where, for a while, it seemed any over-hyped mega-venture with famous private equity-style backers could name its price. WeWork always looked like a bubble. Deflation had to happen.\n\nThe CBI needs to calm down on Corbyn\n\nAdvice for the CBI: damning all Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s economic proposals with equal fury doesn\u2019t work. Sometimes the Labour leader will produce ideas that big business might live with happily, or even come to applaud.\n\nA ministry for employment rights and a workers\u2019 protection agency \u2013 the central pitch in Corbyn\u2019s address to the TUC Congress in Brighton on Tuesday \u2013 should not frighten any responsible employer. Enforcing employment laws vigorously might even benefit companies who would not think of breaching rules in the first place. Free-riders would find life harder and competition might be made marginally fairer.\n\nIt is not a revolutionary idea \u2013 and certainly not a case of \u201cturning back the clock decades\u201d, in the CBI\u2019s excitable catch-all language. Sports Direct was obliged to reform working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse after this paper\u2019s investigations in 2015 and a Commons select committee\u2019s report. The affair struck a chord because workers \u2013 and, most fair-minded bosses \u2013 can recognise grubby behaviour.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nSome other Labour business proposals, it is true, do not stand up to scrutiny or would not even achieve their aims, as argued here in the past. The \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d, via which 10% ownership of every large company would be transferred over a decade to a workers\u2019 pot, should be binned.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary, by far, every year would be the Treasury since dividends for employees would be capped at \u00a3500-a-head. There is nothing inclusive about second-class share ownership, especially when workers\u2019 existing pension schemes would suffer from the share dilution. If Labour wants to boost employee share ownership, cleverer approaches are available.\n\nBut not every Labour idea is as radical as the CBI seems instinctively to believe. Ensuring that employment rights are respected should not be controversial. It would do the CBI no harm to say so.", "description": "Wall Street isn\u2019t playing ball with the shared workspace landlord\u2019s inflated value", "authors": ["Nils Pratley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45b7aedbc89cff918918041e460d67700450b3d4/0_49_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9d1bd0535ba1ca8fd3f45492c9d26b90", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
