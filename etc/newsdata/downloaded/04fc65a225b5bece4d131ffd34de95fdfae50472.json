The ILO, a UN employment rights agency which has been working on reforms with the Qatar government since 2017, said the Gulf country\u2019s ministers had agreed to end kafala and also introduce \u201ca non-discriminatory minimum wage, the first in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nKafala ties workers to so-called sponsorship by their employer, meaning they cannot move jobs or leave the country without the employer\u2019s approval. Human rights groups have campaigned for years to have kafala abolished across the Gulf, whose countries use millions of low-paid immigrant workers mostly from the Indian subcontinent. Fifa\u2019s decision to locate the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has hugely increased scrutiny, and the Qatar government ultimately responded by signing a formal cooperation with the ILO promising to implement improvements.\n\nAmnesty says migrant workers still being exploited in Qatar Read more\n\nThe ILO said the latest reforms have been agreed unanimously by Qatar\u2019s governing council of ministers, and must next pass through the country\u2019s advisory (\u201cshura\u201d) council, before approval by the emir, Sheik Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, which it said is expected by January.\n\nDescribing the abolition of exit permits and \u201cno-objection certificates\u201d for workers moving jobs as marking \u201cthe end of kafala,\u201d the ILO said: \u201cThese steps will greatly support the rights of migrant workers, while contributing to a more efficient and productive economy.\u201d\n\nThe level of the minimum wage, a key reform given the low pay for migrant workers in Qatar, the world\u2019s richest per-capita country, will be set later this year, the ILO said, and not discriminate between nationalities. Last year the Guardian reported that men working on World Cup stadium construction sites far from their families overseas, and living in \u201clabour camps\u201d, were being paid \u00a340 per week in Qatar.\n\nHuman rights groups are increasingly raising the alarm about the dangers of working in the Gulf during a large part of the year when heat and humidity are intense. The Guardian reported this month that expert medical research into the high incidence of fatal heart attacks suffered by previously healthy young men working in Qatar had concluded that hundreds were caused by heat stress.\n\nLast week the ILO announced the results of its own joint study with the Qatar government into heat stress, which concluded that people could safely work outdoors during prescribed hours, if appropriate precautionary measures were taken, which it was working to have passed into law.\n\nNicholas McGeehan, an advocate for improved human rights in the Gulf, said the announced employment reforms should be greeted with \u201cvery cautious optimism\u201d until they are actually passed into law and implemented. He added that: \u201cUrgent action is needed on heat stress in Qatar, and in the Gulf generally.\u201d", "description": "The most deeply resented employment condition for migrant workers in Qatar, the \u2018kafala\u2019 system, is to be abolished in January, the International Labour Organisation has announced", "authors": ["David Conn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4875af37fed026ec946bb6785fda78134f1bcb4b/0_241_4797_2878/master/4797.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=647a29ff63ab12340f86588e2ca1abe1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
