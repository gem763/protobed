Black or white, rich or poor, Peter Crouch is gonna score. God bless Peter Crouch.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old made 47 appearances for the Hoops during a one season spell, scoring 12 goals in the process.\n\nBut Crouch admitted if he hadn't have been a footballer, he'd have fancied a career as a musician.\n\n\"I would have loved it,\" he said. \"I feel like I'm a frontman with no talent. I'd love to be up there but I have no musical talent.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n\"I played 'Three Blind Mice' on the recorder when I was a kid and that was the extent of it really.\n\n\"We've talked about it with [Kasabian star] Serge [Pizzorno] loads, we've had the discussion, because he's a big football fan and he's a good player.\n\n\"I always said to him: 'Would you swap it? Headlining Glastonbury or scoring the winner in the Champions League final?\n\n\"I'm more of a Bez [from the band Happy Mondays], give me some maracas, or I'll do a bit of the triangle.\"\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nWhen quizzed on who would make up his band of footballers, Crouch added: \"[Wayne] Rooney fancies himself as a singer. He'd be a decent frontman.\n\n\"Gareth Barry, strong bass. 100 per cent bass. He'd hold it all together, he'd be like the [Rolling] Stones - around for years. And he gets away with murder.\"\n\nSmart then suggested the drummer would need to be a bit crazy, with Crouch naming Rooney, David Bentley, Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Hendrie among the liveliest \"characters\" he's played with, but settled on a former opponent.\n\n\"Drummer, well Petr Cech,\" Crouch added. \"He is an actual drummer.\"\n\nPeter Crouch was speaking on Episode 11 of Red Stripe Presents: This Feeling TV .", "description": "The ex-Liverpool and Tottenham striker also picked his ideal band made up purely of footballers", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images", "Bbc", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20535464.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Only-Fools-and-Horses.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
