It is singularly the most exciting and sentimental time for everyone involved, from whimpering, proud and somewhat dumbstruck parents to siblings struck with a sense of unnerving freedom about their slightly emptier homes, however melancholy the empty bedroom scene; the clunky void at the dinner table.\n\nMy university experience was in part defined by the annual decoration of a brand new bedroom. The joy of these three rooms was that they bore no emotional or physical hangover from my childhood; no boxes filled with old stuffed toys and files of school reports and no \"but these are the same curtains you\u2019ve always had, darling\" curtains. Instead, these blank spaces gave me the first opportunity I\u2019d ever had to experiment, the only barriers being landlords who didn\u2019t quite trust my 20-year-old self\u2019s judgement where hanging wallpaper was concerned.\n\nCreating a new space once a year for three years bought with it the thrill of a new beginning. Each year, a self-identifying search for posters, trinkets, ornaments and posters saw most of my food budget swallowed away into the space I would temporarily call my home. My office, my refuge, my wine bar, my bedroom. So, here is a list of all the things that I wish I had had with me during the hazy frisson of the first night behind my own college door, in my very first space belonging only to me.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYour first port of call should absolutely be a great set of stationery. For making notes in lectures, of course, but also for documenting your time as a student. Writing in a diary for even just the first month or so of your first term provides some excellent fodder for late night reading for years (and years) to come. Papier offers some of the most compliment-worthy notebooks and planners, each personalisable, so you can put your own stamp on whatever it is you choose to jot down. In particular, the brand\u2019s new collaborations with Fee Greening and Matilda Goad comprise notebooks truly beautiful enough to practice your handwriting for.\n\nIf you find yourself scribbling or typing into the night, ensure you have a great desk lamp. I find working in harsh light to be uninspiring and harsh, so set the mood for an evening of essay-writing with one of the many new lamps available at Andrew Martin\u2019s new Walton Street lighting gallery. Another great place for variety is Made.com, that offers an array of popular Art Deco styles, as well as more contemporary asymmetrical pieces.\n\nNext, make sure you find ceramics and glassware that you love, but are not afraid to use. These items will become small sources of joy throughout your day. A mug or a beautiful plate will take mealtimes from a sad pesto pasta to a decadent meal with a sense of occasion. Burleigh Pottery produces unique crockery sets in striking patterns and colours which can be seen in world-famous hotels and restaurants. A selection is now available online at Liberty, as well as its own website and via Ralph Lauren Home. Another great option for must-have ceramics is Host, an online homewares platform founded last year by Sophie Warburton, Style Director at the Telegraph. The site has a handy \"Under \u00a330\" section, meaning delightful, alternative ceramics and glassware are easier to source than ever. For more glass options, LSA\u2019s AW19 collections will add a new level of elegance to the nights you find yourself playing host to the rest of your corridor-mates.\n\nThis leads nicely on to a device that helps you make friends in the first place. And no, this is not a car or a family castle in Scotland, but the humble doorstop. This handy bedroom accoutrement will give you an air of approachability. Simply prop open your door as you unpack your things to let people know that they are welcome to introduce themselves. There is a great selection of doorstops available on Amara, from tasteful marble and brass styles to more quirky, novelty pieces (a personal favourite being Z\u00fcny, a synthetic leather Dachshund doorstop by Tan & Brown.)\n\nAny university room worth its salt has a poster or two, whether it\u2019s an album cover or a vintage film poster. Vinterior or King & McGaw are great sources for posters and prints for your blank walls, helping you to add some personality to the space. Command strips are essential of course, available from any good stationers.\n\nNext, be conscious that your bed is likely to be the biggest piece of furniture in your room, as well as commanding most of the floorspace. Therefore, it makes sense to choose bedlinen that you love and can live with in a relatively confined space when you\u2019re not at the library or the bar. You can take one of two approaches to choosing your bedlinen. The first approach is maximalism; you understand that the sheets will take up a large portion of your space, and you want to inject colour into the room in the absence of wallpaper. If this is the case, go bold. Sheridan\u2019s new Grandiflora collection will bring the serenity of a wildflower meadow to your bedroom, while Anthropologie\u2019s new artisan quilt and pillow cases provide a hit of glorious, Indian sunshine with summery jewel tones.\n\nThe second route is space-maximising. This works on the basis of maximising your perceived square footage by opting for light colours. For the minimalists amongst you, H&M Home has a gorgeous white cotton percale set with a hint of neat embroidered detailing, while all good homeware shops will sell a plain white set.\n\nAlso, and finally, a word of warning and a knowing nod to all those affected by the irritating drone of a snoring flatmate, Kally Sleep has engineered a pillow to reduce snoring in users by up to 50%. The anti-snore pillow features an ergonomically S-shaped foam core which has been designed to support the head and neck, keeping it at just the right position to improve your breathing, which in turn helps to open your airways. Do yourself and your future flatmates a favour, and quell any somnambulant idiosyncrasies while living with others in such close quarters.\n\nAnd remember, above all else, to relish this time. Your bedroom should be a haven for sleep and study, but you must grasp the opportunities afforded to you outside those four walls. Oh \u2013 and remember to keep up that diary.", "description": "So, your child is fleeing the nest in search of higher education, the best friendships they will ever forge, and the cheapest drinks they will ever buy, all in the name of getting a degree.
