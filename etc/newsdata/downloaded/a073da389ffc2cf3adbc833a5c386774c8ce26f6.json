It\u2019s really hard to do it, but that\u2019s my goal for the whole year.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean player won the Ladies Scottish Open last month for her third LPGA Tour victory.\n\n\u201cI got a lot of confidence and playing like a bit more comfy,\u201d Hur said. \u201cMy long game gets better and putting doing well, everything doing well, so had a good year so far.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s Bronte Law, coming off Europe\u2019s victory over the United States in the Solheim Cup, was two strokes back with Denmark\u2019s Nanna Koerstz Madsen and Japan\u2019s Sakura Yokomine.\n\n\u201cI think just obviously playing in the intensity for a week, and obviously there was so much good golf that went on, just kind of riding off the back of that,\u201d Law said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really surprise me to see that.\u201d\n\nYokomine had five straight birdies on her front nine.\n\n\u201cThis week, just kind of start with like no thinking,\u201d Yokomine said through a translator. \u201cWas thinking like too much about mechanics.\u201d\n\nMarina Alex topped the nine U.S. Solheim Cup players in the field with a 66. She eagled the par-5 14th.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s a good golf course,\u201d Alex said. \u201cThere\u2019s some good little short holes, par 5s are accessible, greens roll really nice. Scorable, but also if you get on the wrong side of things, it can be tricky, too. I think it\u2019s pretty fair.\u201d\n\nAmy Olson and Pornanong Phatlum also shot 66. Ally McDonald followed at 67 with Lauren Stephenson, Jodi Ewart Shadoff, Mirim Lee and Chella Choi. Defending champion Sung Hyun Park opened with a 70.\n\nLexi Thompson, winless at the Solheim Cup, had a 76. The winner of the inaugural event in 2017, she had a double bogey and two bogeys in the birdie-free round.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mi Jung Hur shot a 9-under 63 on Thursday to take the first-round lead in the Indy Women in Tech Championship.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/lpga_tour_golf_57139_c0-103-2470-1543_s1770x1032.jpg?fd53e754f568df408dbce92adbfa9b270a5ec216", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
