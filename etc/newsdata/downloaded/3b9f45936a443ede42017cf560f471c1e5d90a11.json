On the other hand, steady prices look evident enough to enhance the skepticism in global equity markets before the upcoming Fed\u2019s meeting on October 29 \u2013 30. Secondly, most of the technical details of the expected Sino-U.S. trade deal are yet to be finalized; before the U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart come forward to seal a final deal. I find that during such a scenario, growing volatility in global equity markets may find sudden sell-off if they sense any negative development on the tariff trade war front.\n\nFinally, I conclude that this 15-month long Sino-U.S. tariff trade tussle has already damaged the global economies up to a greater extent; and may continue to extend bearishness in global equity markets for a long time in future. I find that growing uncertainty may trigger a sudden sell-off in global equity markets. No doubt that despite a bouncing move in U.S. equity markets on Monday may see exhaustive moves in today\u2019s trading session; which will confirm the continuity of a downward trend in during the month of November 2019.
