Then one day, he cut class, wandered into the library and stumbled onto a book by author Frank Yerby. The discovery changed the life of a teenager who was, in Neal's memory, \"a rather troubled high school senior.\"\n\nYears later, he told his daughter, Karama, at StoryCorps in 2009, he learned that the librarian \u2014 his English teacher \u2014 had quietly and generously orchestrated the effort to transform him into a big reader. Neal went on to attend law school and later became a judge, retiring as an appellate judge of the Arkansas Court of Appeals.\n\nThis episode of StoryCorps originally aired in 2009; it published as an animated video earlier this month.\n\nProduced for Morning Edition by Vanara Taing and Aisha Turner.\n\nStoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.
