It was Winchell again, straying from his usual celebrity gossip to make an observation about the leadership of the Soviet Union, then undergoing a power struggle after the death of Joseph Stalin. Winchell asked in his column, \u201cHowz about calling the Russians our frienemies?\u201d\n\nAmerican writers weren\u2019t the only ones using the word frenemy. Jessica Mitford, an English journalist and activist who escaped the aristocratic life of her famous sisters to settle in the U.S., wrote in 1977 that frenemy was \u201can incredibly useful word that should be in every dictionary, coined by one of my sisters when she was a small child to describe a rather dull little girl who lived near us.\u201d In an essay titled \u201cThe Best of Frenemies\u201d that appeared in both the Daily Mail and The New York Times, Mitford mused, \u201cI wonder whether most of us do not, in fact, spend more time with frenemies than with actual friends or outright enemies?\u201d\n\nIt would take another couple of decades, however, before frenemy became more firmly established in the cultural consciousness. In the 1998 hit song \u201cYou Get What You Give,\u201d by the Los Angeles\u2013based band New Radicals, the front man Gregg Alexander sang of \u201cfrenemies, who when you\u2019re down ain\u2019t your friend.\u201d The rap group Arsonists titled a track \u201cFrienemies\u201d the following year. But it made a bigger splash in 2000, when the HBO show Sex and the City aired an episode called \u201cFrenemies.\u201d\n\nThroughout the aughts, frenemies grew into the go-to term for celebrity pals who clashed in the public eye (think Lauren Conrad and Heidi Montag from The Hills). From pop culture, the term made its way back to politics. After Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, it soon came out that he was considering appointing his erstwhile rival from the primaries, Hillary Clinton, to be his secretary of state. In The New York Times, Maureen Dowd wrote about the news in a column titled \u201cTeam of Frenemies,\u201d playing off Doris Kearns Goodwin\u2019s book about Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Cabinet, Team of Rivals.\n\nTalk of frenemies even penetrated the White House briefing room. Josh Earnest, the last of Obama\u2019s press secretaries, was confronted with the word in two different press briefings in 2015. In April of that year, one reporter asked, \u201cAre the Russians friends? Are they foes? Are they frenemies?\u201d And a few months later, Earnest fielded the question, \u201cHow would you describe the U.S.-Pakistani relationship now? Are we frenemies?\u201d Earnest chuckled and asked, \u201cIs that a technical term?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, old political rivalries have retrospectively received the \u201cfrenemy\u201d treatment. When the working relationship between Ronald Reagan and Tip O\u2019Neill was hailed as a model of bipartisan cooperation by both Obama and Mitt Romney in a 2012 debate, O\u2019Neill\u2019s son Thomas P. O\u2019Neill III looked back on that history in an opinion piece for The New York Times titled \u201cFrenemies: A Love Story.\u201d And going back even further, the feuds that Alexander Hamilton had with Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison (as dramatized in Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s musical Hamilton) have even elicited the \u201cfrenemy\u201d tag. Starting this weekend, the Virginia Museum of History & Culture is launching an exhibit called \u201cFounding Frenemies: Hamilton and the Virginians.\u201d\n\nBy now, frenemy is sufficiently entrenched in the lexicon to be included in major dictionaries from Merriam-Webster, Oxford, and American Heritage. And in politics, it\u2019s commonplace enough that The Washington Post can easily call Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden \u201clongtime frenemies\u201d in a headline. So perhaps the more appropriate question about Steyer\u2019s invocation of the term would be: How did it take so long for frenemies to show up in a debate?", "description": "A newcomer used the term in a presidential debate for the first time ever\u2014and it turned out to be the most apt descriptor of the night.", "authors": ["Ben Zimmer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19289085473929/facebook.jpg?1571247666", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
