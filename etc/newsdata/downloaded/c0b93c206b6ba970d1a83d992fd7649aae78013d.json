She departed from her post months earlier than expected after conservative media outlets and Donald Trump Jr. accused her of being part of an alleged Ukrainian attempt to support Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe statement, made after Trump referred to \u201cthe woman\u201d as \u201cbad news,\u201d is a striking example of the president\u2019s willingness to throw members of his own government \u2015 and citizens of his own country \u2015 under the bus, particularly when he appears to believe that will benefit him personally. Presidents are conventionally expected to conduct themselves as the ultimate representatives of the United States, especially in dealing with foreign dignitaries, to protect officials with far less power and to avoid the appearance of a fractured government apparatus that outsiders can exploit for their own ends.\n\nThe revelation that Trump spoke of punishing Yovanovitch \u2015 whom Zelensky was quick to say he didn\u2019t support because the president told him she \u201cwas a bad ambassador\u201d \u2015 will likely disturb many of the tens of thousands of career professionals working to serve his administration. The effect will be particularly strong at the State Department, which has suffered a serious collapse in morale as Trump has repeatedly proposed slashing its budget and failed to fill its top jobs.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s horrifying is Trump\u2019s implication that, having recalled Ambassador Yovanovitch from post, he also intended to impose some kind of consequences on her for his displeasure at her failure to push his personal \u2015 not policy \u2015 agenda,\u201d Tamara Cofman Wittes, a former State Department official now at the Brookings Institution, told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely chilling to our diplomats serving around the world, a message that their careers are on the line if they don\u2019t go along with abusive, unethical or illegal demands from this administration.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch is still employed by the State Department and currently holds a fellowship at Georgetown University. She did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOfficials dealing with Ukraine have already for months been disturbed by the way their official work has been mixed with the president\u2019s political ambitions, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.\n\nTrump is now implicated in an explicit attempt to pressure Zelensky to find damaging information about his political rival Joe Biden, the former vice president whose son once served on the board of a Ukrainian company, or else lose American military aid for Ukraine\u2019s fight against separatists supported by Russia.\n\nThe summary of the call suggests Trump was angry at Yovanovitch on the basis of claims made by a Ukrainian prosecutor named Yuriy Lutsenko. In March, Lutsenko promised to investigate the Trump team\u2019s claims that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. But Lutsenko suggested the ambassador was tampering with his work and had given him a list of people not to prosecute. Trump\u2019s own State Department denied that charge, but the president appears to have bought it.\n\nRudy Giuliani, who as the president\u2019s personal lawyer has been central to Trump\u2019s attempts to strike political gold in Ukraine, had a personal fixation on Yovanovitch, per the Post. \u201cShe is now working for Soros,\u201d the attorney told the outlet, baselessly invoking right-wing conspiracy theories about Democratic donor George Soros. Giuliani also criticized the State Department apparatus. He appears to have been trying to control U.S.-Ukraine relations himself on a separate track, regularly giving Trump updates about his activities in the country.\n\nAfter Yovanovitch was stripped of her job, Giuliani announced that he would be traveling to Ukraine. The Trump administration has yet to nominate a new ambassador, and the summary released Wednesday suggests the president viewed Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr \u2015 neither of whom has a foreign policy background \u2015 as central to the U.S. approach to the country.\n\nBack in May, Democratic lawmakers already slammed Yovanovitch\u2019s removal as \u201ca political hit job.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this decision was politically motivated, as allies of President Trump had joined foreign actors in lobbying for the ambassador\u2019s dismissal,\u201d Reps. Steny Hoyer (Md.), the House Majority Leader, and Eliot Engel (N.Y.), the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a joint statement. \u201cBy recalling Ambassador Yovanovitch just mere months before her tenure in Ukraine was set to end, the Administration is harming American interests and undermining American diplomacy.\u201d", "description": "\"It's absolutely chilling to our diplomats,\" a former State Department official told HuffPost.", "authors": ["Foreign Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8b96e32200005800512699.jpeg?cache=1yjajda0it&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
