It has been a staple of mystery shows, comedies and even heavyweight dramas. Whether voiceover or to-camera narration, it has helped viewers navigate tricksy plots, or simply revealed a character\u2019s internal state to the audience. Dexter, for instance, would not have worked without the voiceover giving us access to his \u201cdark passenger\u201d, and we would have struggled to stay abreast of the numerous threads, character connections and comical call-backs in Arrested Development without its dryly critical narrator.\n\nBut all of this has changed in recent years. Characters are no longer narrating to an imagined \u201cother\u201d, with audience members simply eavesdropping. Instead, the audience is becoming a vital part of the show, and perhaps even a character within it. Mr Robot has let its protagonist, Elliot (Rami Malek), talk to us in voiceover since episode one. \u201cHello, friend,\u201d his soporific voice greets us, lulling us into a false sense of security that this is a garden-variety TV voiceover. But \u2013 as the show has gone on \u2013 Elliot has called on us more and more, asking us to help him search a room for clues, or berating us for withholding information from him. He has also lied to us \u2013 including not telling us that he was in prison for most of season two.\n\nIn the fourth and final season, currently airing, Elliot has stopped speaking to us. We appear to have fallen out, for reasons that are not yet clear. His alter-ego, Mr Robot (Christian Slater), is speaking to us instead, asking for our help with Elliot. The show has also revealed that Mr Robot isn\u2019t Elliot\u2019s only alternate personality \u2013 there is a third one, too. In addition, memories of his mother and himself as a boy also live in Elliot\u2019s mind. \u201cMaybe I should give you a name,\u201d Elliot told us back in episode one. \u201cBut that\u2019s a slippery slope; you\u2019re only in my head.\u201d Now, in season four, we are literally in his head, spying on what is going on in there, with fans speculating that his third personality could actually be us \u2013 the imaginary friend he has been speaking to from the very beginning. It is all a far cry from the sardonic narration of Malcolm in the Middle, or JD\u2019s voiceover and fantasy sequences in Scrubs. Rather than narration being used to tie each episode into a neat bow at the end, it is there to complicate matters.\n\nMr Robot is not the only show that uses narration to draw the audience in. We have seen Frank Underwood\u2019s sinister narration in House of Cards turn us into something like an of an accessory to his many crimes, before Kevin Spacey\u2019s own alleged crimes precipitated his departure from the show. Underwood\u2019s narration even bled into the real world when Spacey uploaded a bizarre in-character video, in which he seemed to comment on his own misdeeds. \u201cYou trusted me, even though you knew you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said, seemingly implying that viewers were complicit in Frank\u2019s \u2013 and his own \u2013 behaviour.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Speak your mind ... Phoebe Waller-Bridge addresses the camera as Fleabag. Photograph: Luke Varley/BBC/Two Brothers/Luke Varley\n\nFleabag took things a step further, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s to-camera narration turning us into her confidante. In an interview with Tina Fey earlier this year, Waller-Bridge said she wanted the audience to feel as if Fleabag had invited them to be her friend, only for the character to become scared when her new \u201cfriends\u201d start to get too close. \u201c[The camera] begins to hang around longer than she wants it to hang around,\u201d Waller-Bridge explains. \u201cIt\u2019s like when someone asks you to hang out with them and it\u2019s really intense really quickly and they\u2019re like: \u2018We\u2019re best friends!\u2019 Then you\u2019re starting to ask a bit too personal questions and they\u2019re like: \u2018Actually, I\u2019m not ready for this relationship.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut where Fleabag really tore down the wall between show and audience was in the scene where Andrew Scott\u2019s priest followed Fleabag\u2019s gaze and \u2013 briefly, thrillingly \u2013 locked eyes with us. Viewers the world over screamed in surprise and delight as he asked: \u201cWhat was that?\u201d It was about as close to a jump-scare as a comedy-drama can get, but was also the moment that the viewers were really dragged into the show. We were a real character (albeit projected) that Fleabag had been speaking to, and the priest was the first person to pay attention to her enough to notice. When she waved us a sad but optimistic goodbye in the final episode, our co-dependent friendship had finally reached a healthy end.\n\nBut just why are these narrators appealing to their audiences? Arguably this device has its roots in our ever-connected social media age; from theorising over mysteries such as Sherlock\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d and delving into Game Of Thrones\u2019 various prophesies, we are more involved in our favourite TV than ever before. It makes sense that those very shows would, in turn, seek to draw us in even closer, turning viewers into characters and plot points, and placing them at the centre of big twists (see also Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, in which the the audience was more than just a character within the show \u2013 we were the villain, a malignant force driving the protagonist steadily insane). As VR becomes a more viable platform, and interactive television like Bandersnatch becomes increasingly achievable, it is likely that we will only be drawn further and further into the stories we love. Despite growing TV audiences, things have never felt so personal.", "description": "While voiceovers once addressed audiences en masse, Mr Robot and Fleabag are among a wave of shows revelling in ripping down the fourth wall", "authors": ["Abigail Chandler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0aa33cca4df7add36210c8c02bf0c3b537bec9d/0_2_1675_1005/master/1675.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f08f2f6e195cccece465cd3407136386", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
