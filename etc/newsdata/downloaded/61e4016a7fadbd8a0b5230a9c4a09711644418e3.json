We realise it looks like frozen yoghurt on a stick.\n\n\"The lolly looks like a penis. She is expecting something very good. I don't think it's very good. It's mediocre.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nWhen they get there, the stunned corporate client is mortified by the shape of the lollies she is meant to be buying.\n\nShe says: \"I actually think it looks a little bit rude if I\u2019m being honest. I can't agree with you it's a premium product. I\u2019m just going to leave it here.\"\n\nThe boys try to reduce their price dramatically from \u00a33.85 per lolly to just \u00a31.25, but the client declines their ever decreasing offers.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nThis comes after the lads get into a very heated argument in the kitchen that threatens to thaw out there lollies.\n\n\"That doesn\u2019t look premium does it,\" admits Dean Ahmad, who got the order with the corporate client.\n\nFurious Riyonn Farsad blames the sales team for not giving them good enough instructions.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHe says: \"You had a one-on-one with the client who wanted a bespoke lolly. You didn\u2019t come back with a bespoke lolly, you came back with flavours.\"\n\nDean shouts back: \"I told you to make it premium. Does that look premium?\"\n\nKenna Ngoma is forced to get in the middle and put his hands in front of the rowing pair as he cries \"stop\".\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nRiyonn can't believe that the edible glitter and coconut milk \"disappeared\" when they produced the lolly.\n\nSpeaking to camera, Dean says: \"I made it categorically clear it was going to be premium. Nothing about that product says premium. It looks cheap and tacky.\"\n\nHave they ruined their chances in the task?\n\n*The Apprentice airs Wednesdays on BBC One at 9pm", "description": "The lads get into a heated row when their premium ice lollies for a corporate client end up looking very sexual", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20545143.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Apprentice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
