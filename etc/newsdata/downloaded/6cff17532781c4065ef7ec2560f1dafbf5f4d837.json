I can only skate well enough for a netminder \u2014 I don\u2019t think I could play up front,\u201d he said.\n\nCech won four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups, the Champions League and the Europa League during his Chelsea career, with a further FA Cup success coming at Arsenal.\n\nWith Guildford, success is uncertain, but Cech, who owns the all-time record for the most clean sheets in the Premiership, is looking forward to the first game.\n\n\u201cI was allowed to practise with the team but I couldn\u2019t play games. It\u2019s great to have the opportunity now and I hope it will end well.\u201d\n\nAs if to boost his chances, Cech chose a shirt number 39 once worn by Dominik Hasek, his childhood idol, two-time Stanley Cup winner and six-time Vezina Trophy holder for the NHL\u2019s best goaltender.\n\nHasek, who is currently contemplating running for the Czech president, led the Czechs to a sensational win at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, the first-ever Olympic tournament bringing together all NHL stars.\n\nIf there is a cause for concern, it is media interest, Cech said after his new career had made the headlines across the world.\n\n\u201cNobody expected this. We have no idea what it will come down to at the rink on Sunday, but I guess we\u2019ll have to curb the media interest somehow,\u201d Cech said.", "description": "Prague (AFP) \u2013 Facing his first-ever ice hockey game in Britain\u2019s fourth-tier competition, former Chelsea and Arsenal keeper Petr Cech insists", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/dd9271_petr-cech-is-up-ice-hockey-hockey-hurts-football-petr-cech-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
