Boris Johnson got there in just one vote.\n\nThe biographer of Winston Churchill entered Downing Street breathing rhetorical fire just one day before parliament was closed for the summer. On his very first day back in Parliament, he lost his majority in the House of Commons and was then defeated by his own side in a bitter battle over his trademark Brexit policy.\n\nThe prime minister was reduced to begging the opposition parties to agree to a general election after he lost the power to deliver a Brexit of his choosing by 328 votes to 301. Lawmakers are expected to vote to rule out a hard, no-deal Brexit on Wednesday, which Johnson believes will destroy his ability to negotiate a good deal with the European Union.\n\nKamikaze Boris Johnson Risks Becoming Britain\u2019s Shortest-Serving PM\n\nJohnson came to power boasting an ironclad, \u201cdo-or-die\u201d commitment to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31. Braggadocious stories leaked to senior newspaper reporters explained that\u2014after May\u2019s failure to deliver Brexit\u2014the real men were now in charge and would channel the spirit of \u201cCocaine Mitch\u201d to force through their plan using every mechanism or procedure in the book.\n\nJohnson appointed a notoriously spiky strategist as his chief of staff, and last week they broke with precedent and asked the queen to shut down parliament for five weeks until just before the Brexit deadline to prevent lawmakers thwarting Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan. The move was condemned as a constitutional outrage, and tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest in cities and towns across Britain.\n\nInstead of convincing opponents within his own Conservative party to back down, the extraordinary gambit only served to strengthen their resolve. When it looked as though there would be enough rebels for the House of Commons to seize control of parliamentary business from Johnson, No. 10 responded not with conciliatory overtures but by threatening to kick anyone who voted against him out of the Conservative Party and banning them from running for re-election under the party\u2019s banner.\n\nOn Tuesday night, 21 members of the party disregarded the threats and voted to take away Johnson\u2019s control over Brexit. The so-called \u201crebel alliance\u201d will use that control to hold a new vote on Wednesday that would force Johnson to seek a further Brexit extension from the European Union.\n\nThe lawmakers who risked their own careers and were thus willing to be expelled from the Conservative Party in order to facedown their party leader included a former chancellor of the exchequer, a former attorney general and Ken Clarke, a veteran of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Cabinet, who now holds the unofficial position of Father of the House, as the longest serving member of the Commons.\n\nAnother of the rebels was Sir Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Churchill, Johnson\u2019s cherished hero.\n\nAssuming the prime minister goes through with his threat to boot these Conservative stalwarts from the party, he will be reduced to presiding over the smallest minority government for 30 years.\n\nPhilip Lee had already destroyed Johnson\u2019s majority earlier in the day when he quit the party and \u201ccrossed the aisle\u201d\u2014to sit with the Liberal Democrats\u2014while the prime minister was speaking.\n\n\u201cThis Conservative Government is aggressively pursuing a damaging Brexit in unprincipled ways,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt is undermining our country\u2019s economy, democracy and role in the world. It is using political manipulation, bullying and lies. And it is doing these things in a deliberate and considered way.\u201d\n\nJohnson challenged the opposition Labour party to back his calls for a general election to be held on Oct. 15, before the Halloween deadline he has pledged to meet. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would only agree to an election once the threat of no deal had been taken off the table.\n\nIt is very likely that an election will be held in the coming months, and the only thing on Johnson\u2019s record will be the failure to deliver his only policy.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
