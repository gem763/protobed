He will remain with the company as non-executive chairman.\n\nScrutiny of his leadership had \"become a significant distraction,\" it said.\n\nThe move comes after WeWork's plans for a stock market listing ran into trouble, with investors raising concerns about losses and governance.\n\n\"While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,\" Mr Neumann said in a statement.\n\nWeWork's board of directors said it had named WeWork's Artie Minson, formerly co-president and chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, formerly vice chairman, co-chief executives of the company.\n\nMr Neumann built WeWork in his own image, creating a buzzy, multi-billion dollar company known for its co-working spaces, free-flowing alcohol and a stated mission to \"elevate the world's consciousness\".\n\nSince 2010, the firm has expanded from a single office in New York City to more than 500 locations in 29 countries. Japanese investment giant Softbank valued the company at $47bn (\u00a337bn) in its most recent investment round.\n\nBut Mr Neumann's brash charisma, which once attracted investors, emerged as a liability as WeWork decided to sell its shares on the public market. Reports suggest the firm's expected valuation had sunk to between $10bn and $12bn.\n\nReports surfaced detailing erratic decision making and the ways his hard-partying habits had infused corporate culture.\n\nPerhaps most alarming to potential investors were the ways Mr Neumann had blurred the lines between his own personal finances and WeWork.\n\nFor example, over the years, the company had been a tenant in some properties that he owned; and Mr Neumann, who had voting control of the company, had also secured personal loans using company stock as collateral.\n\n\"I think many investors are uncomfortable with Neumann's relationship with the company,\" Sam Reynolds, a technology analyst, told the BBC.\n\nChanging roles\n\nMr Neumann agreed to modify some of those arrangements as it became clear that he was losing support from major backers, such as Softbank.\n\nFor example, he returned the $5.9m in stock he received for selling WeWork the trademark \"We\" and agreed to give WeWork any profit from properties he owns that the company leases.\n\nHis wife Rebekah, a WeWork co-founder who had been given the power to identify a successor, also had her role reduced.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Neumann's wife Rebekah is co-founder and chief brand officer at WeWork but her role is controversial\n\nMr Neumann has reportedly also agreed to significantly reduce his voting powers. But even that move and his role change may not assuage concerns about the company, which lost nearly $2bn last year.\n\nMarket sentiment has turned, after shares in other high-profile, loss-making start-ups such as ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft, have crashed following flotation.\n\nAnd critics have long complained that WeWork's financials don't make sense, pointing to the firm's losses and the much lower valuations of similar companies such as rival IWG, which used to be known as Regus.\n\nWeWork \"is a property company trying to sprinkle tech company fairy dust over itself,\" said Richard Kramer, founder of Arete Research. \"That won't work with investors.\"\n\nThe company was relying on its stock market launch to unlock new loans, which means its delay could spell trouble.\n\nMr Reynolds said he expected the company to remain privately held for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"I think the IPO will be delayed indefinitely,\" he said. \"WeWork certainly has a future, but not as a public company.\"\n\nWho is Adam Neumann?\n\nBorn in Israel, Mr Neumann served in the Israeli Navy before moving to New York to \"get a great job, have tons of fun and make a lot of money\", as he put it in a 2017 TechCrunch interview.\n\nHe enrolled at Baruch College at the City University of New York in 2002, but dropped out just shy of graduation to go into business.\n\nOne of his early ventures was a baby clothing company that evolved into the luxury Egg Baby brand.\n\nLater, he and business partner Miguel McKelvey, an architect, renovated an office space and sublet the property. They sold the business but the idea grew into WeWork.\n\nRead more: A profile of Adam Neumann", "description": "The boss of the trendy office rental firm says stepping aside is \"in the best interests of the firm\".", "authors": ["Natalie Sherman", "Business Reporter", "New York"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9DB0/production/_106786304_neumann1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
