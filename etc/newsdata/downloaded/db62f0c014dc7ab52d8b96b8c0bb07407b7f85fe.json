While that would be enviable growth for many companies, the clip is modestly below Google's pace historically. Also, for Google more than most others, strong results raise concerns about its market dominance. Its ad revenue rose 17% to $33.9 billion, contributing to an overall profit of $7.1 billion.\n\nAnalysts and investors are encouraging the company to continue its pursuit of new advertising opportunities for such units as its YouTube video platform and the ubiquitous Google Maps app. Yet such efforts to generate profit across the conglomerate could further animate antitrust regulators.\n\nThe Trump administration and 50 attorneys general have already opened wide probes into Google, including whether it has an unfair advantage over smaller advertising rivals.\n\nThe Department of Justice's antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, said last week that a breakup of Silicon Valley's tech giants is \"perfectly on the table\" as part of evaluations of whether companies abuse their market power.\n\nAlphabet's profit for the latest quarter was lower than Wall Street's expectations and down 23% from a year earlier, when the result was boosted by changes to the U.S. tax code. The company's margin for the third quarter was also crimped as costs rose, a long-term concern for investors.\n\nAlphabet's stock fell 1% after hours. The shares are up roughly 25% this year, in line with the broader technology market.\n\nAdvertising is central to the Google narrative, constituting the majority of the company's revenue, and also because the company is scant with disclosures on other areas of its business. Alphabet has resisted requests from analysts to detail the performance of YouTube, for instance, and combines results from nascent units like the Waymo self-driving car division, hardware and cloud computing in a line item that Google simply calls \"Other Bets.\"\n\nWrite to Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 28, 2019 18:03 ET (22:03 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
