Nor would there be any transition period for economies to prepare and adjust.\n\nThe Commission will say that if London were to choose the no-deal option, the EU would only be ready to discuss future ties with Britain once it addressed the issue of the rights of EU citizens who arrived in Britain before Brexit. These are now regulated by the withdrawal agreement rejected by British MPs.\n\nThe United Kingdom would also have to honor its financial obligations to the EU, and preserve the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the island of Ireland after decades of sectarian violence.\n\nBritain would also have to preserve the integrity of the EU single market, the Commission will say. Both issues have been dealt with in the rejected divorce agreement.\n\nTo facilitate expert advice and coordination among EU governments in case of a no-deal Brexit, the Commission will set up a call center and a hotline telephone number available in all 27 EU countries and all EU languages.", "description": "The European Commission on Wednesday will propose financial help for European Union businesses, workers and farmers if Britain crashes out of the bloc without any agreement, a document seen by Reuters said.", "authors": ["Jan Strupczewski", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
