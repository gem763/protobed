Photo: Disney\n\nTime for the animators of Star Wars Resistance to render a rainbow flag. The show\u2019s executive producers, Justin Ridge and Brandon Auman, sat down with the Coffee With Kenobi podcast and said that they\u2019ve got a happy gay couple on their show. Okra, a Chadra-Fan, and Flix, a different unconfirmed alien species, are \u201can item\u201d in the words of Ridge. But what kind of item? \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely a gay couple and we\u2019re proud of that,\u201d Auman added. Apparently they have been this whole time, and Okra voice actor Bobby Moynihan, for one, is relieved that the secret is out. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so happy we\u2019re allowed to say it,\u201d Moynihan said on the podcast. \u201cI have had a sentence prepared for a year and a half if someone would finally ask me. I would say, \u2018All I can say is when Flix says \u2018I love you,\u2019 Orca says \u2018I know.\u2019\u201d If you\u2019d like to see the characters sharing a sort of Nathan Lane and Robin Williams in Birdcage moment, the EPs said people should take a look at this clip. Here\u2019s to more \u201cexclusively gay\u201d Star Wars moments.", "description": "Star Wars Resistance producers say that the characters Okra and Flix are \u201cabsolutely a gay couple,\u201d so let\u2019s celebrate that.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/30/30-star-wars-orka-flix.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
