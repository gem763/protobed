Last week, it warned a bad Brexit deal would cost the firm \u00a31.2billion a year and put tens of thousands of jobs in Britain at risk.\n\nThat is a stark warning from a company which has invested heavily into central England in recent years.\n\nBut drive a McLaren 570GT for a week like I have and it will reignite your belief that British vehicle makers can survive anything - including a bad Brexit deal.\n\nBritish brilliance: McLaren sold a record number of cars last year. We decided to find out why demand is so high by taking the stunning 570GT for a near 1,000-mile test\n\nWhat is the McLaren 570GT?\n\nCurrently, it is the tamest of all McLarens on sale.\n\nBear that statement in mind when you consider these statistics: a 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8, maximum power output of 562bhp, acceleration from 0 to 62mph in 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 204mph. It also has suicide doors. Not exactly what you'd call mellow, is it?\n\nBut despite all that, this is as close as we've come to seeing the British supercar builder create something with its sensible hat on.\n\nFor now, it's the only GT - or grand tourer - in the McLaren range, designed to deal with long-distance journeys that doesn't need to end in the car park of a chiropractor.\n\nHowever, it hasn't been built from the ground up with the the sole focus of comfort in mind - far from it.\n\nInstead, it shares its DNA with McLaren's barnstorming 570S Sport Series model, though tuned - or detuned - into something that can be marketed as something slightly more civilised.\n\nMaking it less performance orientated has come at a cost to customers, though.\n\nThe \u00a3157,000 price tag is a \u00a310,000 premium on the 570S it's based on, which also happens to be the 'most affordable' McLaren in showrooms today.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The tamest McLaren yet: That's some statement, and one that needs to be taken with a pinch of salt when you consider it has a top speed of 204mph. And can you really call a car with suicide doors mellow?\n\nWhat does that extra ten grand get you?\n\nIn a nutshell, a boot that isn't really a boot, a slight delay on needing a hearing aid and suspension that will rattle your bones rather than see them disintegrate.\n\nThe unique rear storage deck offers an additional, claimed, 220-litres of loading room to combine with the 150-litres already in the nose to provide - again, claimed - Ford Focus rivaling luggage space.\n\nIn reality, that rear hatch is about good enough for a couple of suit carriers and not much else unless you want to entirely block the view through the rear window.\n\nThat said, the glass lid is a stunning piece of craftsmanship and McLaren's incredible eye to detail means each one is hinged for its delivery destination so it always opens on the pavement side (rising to the right for UK-bound models and the left for cars shipped to America, for instance).\n\nThat unique rear storage deck offers a claimed 220 litres of extra luggage space. Combined with the compartment in the nose of the 570GT, it has around the same carrying capacity as a Ford Focus family car\n\nThe glass door is a beautiful piece of design. McLaren even hinges each one specifically to where it will be used so it always opens on the pavement side\n\nAs well as being able to carry more of your passenger's luggage, it also lets you hold a conversation with the lucky person you've hand-picked to share the trip with.\n\nThat's because McLaren has loaded it with sound-deadening materials to effectively mute the twin-turbo 3.8-litre motor that's stowed just a matter of inches from your lobes.\n\nWhile this has added a fraction more weight (37kg more than a 570S when combined with the glass boot lid), it does mean your vocal chords and eardrums won't have to compete against a Pavarotti-like engine soundtrack for hours.\n\nThe tyres have also been changed, with Pirelli P-Zeros compromising grip for reduced road noise and better spine-protecting ride quality.\n\nSofter suspension springs, comfier damping and slower steering make the 570GT feel less agile than the 570S it's based on, but you'll appreciate it when you're embarking on long-distance journeys\n\nAlso saving your back from reconstructive surgery is a more forgiving suspension set-up.\n\nThe springs are softer than those fitted to the 570S and the dampers have been calibrated to ease the thud of potholes on your bottom.\n\nThe steering rack has also been slowed slightly to make it turn more like a well-trained Crufts winner rather than darting from one direction to the other like a Jack Russell chasing a fly.\n\nFinally, in what can only be described as a brave new world for McLaren, it's been lavished with a glovebox, central storage compartment and - prepare to gasp - a cupholder. Fernando Alonso's F1 car doesn't even get that!\n\nJust because it's easy to drive at low speeds, don't underestimate it's ferocious power. Have the rev needle flicking close to 6,000rpm and static objects disappear out of sight quicker than movie credits on super fast forward\n\nIt manages a near-impossible feat for any supercar\n\n'How fast is it?' Get used to readying an answer to that question if you buy one.\n\nMcLaren 570GT: Will it fit in my garage? Price: \u00a3157,000 On sale: Now Engine: 3.8-litre twin turbo V8 petrol Gearbox: 7-speed dual clutch auto Drive: Rear wheel drive Maximum power: 562bhp Maximum torque: 443lbft Top speed: 204mph Acceleration 0-62mph: 3.4s Acceleration 0-124mph: 9.8s Braking 62-0mph: 33m Braking 124-0mph: 133m CO2 emissions: 249g/km Weight: 1.398kg\n\nAnd trying to make the monumental speed of the 570GT sound plausible to someone who has never experienced something that accelerates quite so ferociously is a taxing process.\n\nPut simply, once you do plant the throttle to the floor, static objects disappear out of sight quicker than movie credits on fast forward.\n\nBut that's not to say it feels unruly and extreme at all times - and that's down to some genius work by McLaren.\n\nThat's because - despite having a pair of turbos - the power doesn't come in lumps.\n\nInstead, the increase in thrust is matched to the rise in revs, similar to that of a naturally aspirated (non turbocharged or supercharged) motor.\n\nSend the needle up to 6,000rpm and it becomes - as you might expect - a warp-speed bullet with a boot.\n\nBut keep the engine ticking over lower down the range and it's a shockingly easy car to drive at pedestrian speeds, even through the centre of London during rush hour.\n\nThe slower steering makes it far more predictable navigating narrow side streets.\n\nThat glass rear storage panel and well proportioned wing mirrors even mean adequate all-round visibility.\n\nAnd the smoothness of the throttle response and power delivery prevents any embarrassing lurches as you creep towards a set of traffic lights with a pavement audience desperately seeking flaws in your driving ability.\n\nAnd it's not even that wide, for a car of this ilk. Even if the footprint is far larger than that of a Ford Fiesta supermini, it's no more difficult to usher through urban obstacles.\n\nThere aren't many \u00a3160k sports cars that can boast that. And considering many potential customers will be big-city slickers, being easy to drive through town shouldn't - though sometimes strangely is - be considered a flaw of a supercar.\n\nThe Cars and Motoring verdict\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Every facet of the car, from the design and the manufacturing is of the highest quality. It's a long way from the shoddy workmanship sometimes seen in the British car industry during the late 70s and 80s\n\nThe extra weight, softer settings and added comfort will ultimately mean the 570GT won't match the much-adorned 570S if you pitted the pair head-to-head on track. But that's not where a GT car earns its stripes.\n\nIs there enough performance to make it worthy of supercar status? I'm happy to report first hand that 562bhp and 204mph is more than enough for any mere mortal to deal with, especially as this will predominantly be used by owners on the road.\n\nBut what stands out most about the 570GT is the immense quality of the entire package. And that's some testament to the level that British car making has reached.\n\nMcLaren sold 3,340 cars in 2017 - more than any other year since the brand was officially created in 2010\n\nLong gone are the days of late 1970s and 80s shoddy workmanship. Instead, every facet - from the design to the development, manufacturing and finish all conducted at the Woking headquarters - is completed at the highest level of expertise.\n\nIt's this incredible attention to detail that has helped McLaren to consistently set new sales records almost every year since the automotive branch hit the market in 2010, peaking at 3,340 cars in 2017.\n\nAnd even if a not-so-favourable Brexit deal is agreed, the phenomenal standard of product is likely to keep McLaren demand as high as ever.\n\nSo if the 570GT is more than a sublime GT car - it's a benchmark of high-quality output for other British motor brands to aim for if they too want to survive the forthcoming changes to the economical landscape.", "description": "The 570GT is the only grand tourer in the current McLaren range and it's designed to deal with long-distance journeys that don't need to end in the chiropractor's car park.
