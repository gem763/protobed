The Spirit of Shankly supporters group have called for the Premier League to adjust the kick-off, for the wellbeing of both clubs.\n\nSky Sports will be busy as ever, but have had to compete with BT and Amazon Prime this year\n\n'The latest round of televised Premier League games has been announced and once again there is scant, if any, consideration given to match-going supporters and those employed at the stadiums,' said the group in a statement.\n\n'Both sets of supporters will encounter difficulty getting to and from the stadium. (Liverpool fans) will not get home until after midnight and the following day is back to work for many.\n\n'And let's not forget the Leicester City employees and those working in public services who will be required to work these hours. How will they get there, and how will they get home?\n\n'The Premier League and TV companies repeatedly ignore the welfare of supporters. But they do have a chance to redeem themselves.\n\n'Spirit of Shankly call on the authorities to do the right thing and revert all Boxing Day fixtures to a sensible kick-off time. We suggest 3pm.'\n\nIt is the first time such volume of live football has been broadcast during the busiest period in the English football calendar, and could be a sign of things to come for future live football arrangements.\n\nThe full run of fixtures finally arrive after being five days late from the original scheduled release.\n\nThe delay had left many fans frustrated at being unable to make plans and book travel over the busy festive period.\n\nLiverpool will put on free travel to help fans get back from the 8pm Leicester tie on Boxing Day\n\nMany representatives from football clubs voiced their opinion, with The Chelsea Supporters' Trust among those stating: 'These fixtures are five days late. This impacts on family arrangements, the price of train tickets, the ability to book leave and much more.\n\n'It is especially sensitive over Christmas, when match-going fans already have challenges regarding fitting in with family arrangements.'\n\nWhile the Newcastle United Supporters' Trust added: 'Due to our geography, Newcastle fans naturally end up paying way more on average to follow their team on the road.\n\n'The longer we wait for confirmation of away fixtures, the more expensive the trip becomes.\n\n'Throw Christmas into the mix, naturally a busier and more expensive time of year, and some fans are faced with a huge financial burden if they want to follow their team away from home thanks to yet another delay.'", "description": "The Premier League fixtures for the Christmas period have finally been revealed, with Arsenal vs Manchester United featuring as the headline act of a nine-game run on New Years Day.", "authors": ["Danny Gallagher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/23/19861518-0-image-a-13_1571353149761.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
