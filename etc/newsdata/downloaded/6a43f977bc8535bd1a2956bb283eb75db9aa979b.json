Its salvation, ironically, may be a gangster epic that looks like a heavy Oscar favorite.\n\nThe start of the traditional fall TV season in late September has been teeming with ads for new streaming services from Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.02% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.48%, both of which debut in November. Comcast Corp.\u2019s CMCSA, -0.27% NBCUniversal service and AT&T Inc.\u2019s T, +0.40% HBO Max are due in spring 2020.\n\nThe onslaught of content could be as overwhelming for consumers as the cutthroat competition is among the combatants.\n\nKeeping track of what program plays on what service is tough enough. Adding to the acrimony, Disney is banning Netflix ads across its TV networks, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. (Disney, Comcast and AT&T are expected to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising over the next year to promote their new streaming-video services. Netflix spent $1.8 billion on advertising last year.) Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger resigned from Apple\u2019s board in September on the same day Apple announced pricing for its streaming service.\n\nRead more: Disney CEO Bob Iger resigns from Apple\u2019s board\n\nIt all makes for must-see streaming-TV as Netflix NFLX, +0.61% kicks off the earnings season among the principal combatants next week.\n\nWhat we might learn about each of the major players during earnings season:\n\nNetflix Inc.\n\n(See sidebar.) Earnings will be reported Oct. 16.\n\nAT&T Inc. (Oct. 23)\n\nAT&T\u2019s as-yet-unpriced HBO Max, due in spring 2020, is the new streaming home of \u201cFriends\u201d and an exhaustive list of original shows and movies from the likes of Reese Witherspoon, Joss Whedon, Jordan Peele, Stephen King, and producer Greg Berlanti (\u201cDawson\u2019s Creek,\u201d \u201cRiverdale\u201d). It also owns the exclusive rights to \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\n\nTop-quality, yes. But how does it coexist with HBO Now, and does it water down the HBO brand?\n\nMany of the people who made HBO a powerhouse have departed, though HBO Max has poached executives from Nickelodeon and Disney to oversee family programming, the CEO of Otter Media to handle digital.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (Oct. 24)\n\nAmazon Prime Video, which starts at $12.99 a month, has been Netflix\u2019s main rival until nearly every major content provider made the plunge into streaming. It\u2019s got plenty of content \u2014 Thursday Night Football, \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d and the new anthology series \u201cModern Love\u201d starring Tina Fey and Anne Hathaway \u2014 if you can find them in its clumsy interface.\n\nThis is one of the criticisms of Amazon, thought it remains the No. 2 streaming service after Netflix.\n\nAmazon Prime Video will close out 2019 as the second-largest subscription OTT service provider with 96.5 million viewers, up 9% from 2018, according to eMarketer. By 2021, Amazon Prime Video\u2019s audience is expected to equal a third of the U.S. population, eMarketer said.\n\nIn comparison, Netflix is expected to reach 158.8 million viewers by the end of 2019, eMarketer said.\n\nComcast Corp. (Oct. 24)\n\nComcast NBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock will be the new streaming home of \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d when it premieres in April 2020. It has yet to announce pricing.\n\n\u201cWe looked and said, \u2018Let\u2019s do something different than in a very increasingly crowded field\u2019 and \u2018what is our fastest way to get to profitability and do so with the least amount of investment?,\u2019\u201d Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia Conference in New York City in August. He described Peacock as an ad-supported, direct-to-consumer service.\n\nBeyond that, what it has to offer is anyone\u2019s guess. Comcast has admitted its \u201cvast majority\u201d of content is initially likely to be acquired. The platform is also likely to host content from Sky Studios, which Comcast purchased last year as part of its $39 billion acquisition of Sky.\n\nThe premise of Peacock as a place to see beloved reruns is intriguing, if not exactly a financial driver. Nonetheless, NBCUniversal plans to promote Peacock hard during its coverage of the 2020 Summer Olympics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe [Peacock is] going to materially affect Comcast and our ability to grow,\u201d Roberts said in August. \u201cWe can make this investment, it can be significant, but not in a way that will retard NBC from the growth we\u2019ve been able to enjoy.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (Oct. 30)\n\nApple TV+ is depending on a former \u201cFriend\u201d and a touch of Spielberg-ian magic when it debuts Nov. 1. It\u2019s also offering the service free for one year with the purchase of any new Apple device.\n\nThe $4.99-per-month service is getting plenty of run with a TV advertising blitz and the marketing efforts of Apple, which has positioned it as the linchpin of its burgeoning Services division. That\u2019s especially important for Apple investors, who are keeping a keen eye on Services, whose revenue growth has compensated for a drop in iPhone sales.\n\nRead more: The iPhone just did something it hasn\u2019t done in nearly 7 years, and it isn\u2019t good for Apple\n\nBeyond the veneer of \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell, Apple is leaning on Old Hollywood stalwarts Steven Spielberg (\u201cAmazing Stories\u201d reboot) and Oprah Winfrey. The company will reportedly release three films \u2014 \u201cThe Banker,\u201d \u201cHala,\u201d and \u201cThe Elephant Queen\u201d \u2014 in theaters before they appear on Apple TV+.\n\nAs with most Apple products, patience is required. The company\u2019s initial content looks thin, and it might require an acquisition or two to build it out. Then again, Apple has previously entered established markets late, built a formidable audience through its proprietary platform, and then helped redefine the market.\n\nRoku Inc. (Nov. 6)\n\nRoku ROKU, -0.49% shares have soared 244% this year this year on strong earnings, but its shares have retreated 38% since the Sept. 6 record close of $169.86, on fears of competition.\n\nOppenheimer Research analyst Jason Helfstein rejects the premise that Roku is vulnerable. In a note late last month, he gave the stock an Outperform rating and boosted its price target by $35 to $155. FactSet\u2019s average analyst estimate is $131.\n\nHelfstein based his bullish view on international growth opportunities \u2014 they made up 10% of Roku\u2019s sales in the first half of this year \u2014 and Roku\u2019s ability to resell streaming content from Apple, Disney, and others. Potential competing products from Facebook Inc. FB, -0.43% and others, he wrote, are \u201ctoo late.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that the technology we\u2019ve developed, the skills we have, our strategy, applies directly to international,\u201d Roku CEO Anthony Wood said on a conference call in August, though he declined to detail the company\u2019s expansion plans. \u201cWe think we will be successful there.\u201d\n\nWalt Disney Co. (Nov. 7)\n\nThe $6.99-per-month Disney+ debuts in North America Nov. 12 with arguably the deepest library of content: Disney classics, \u201cStar Wars,\u201d the Marvel Universe, Pixar, \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d National Geographic. Under a three-year agreement, the service costs $3 a month. A bundled package with ESPN and Hulu costs $12.99 a month.\n\nOn the surface, Disney seems to have it all: World-famous content. Far-reaching digital platforms. A traditional TV network to produce and market programs. A younger audience that drives home purchases. In a tweet, the company promised more than 7,500 episodes and 500 movies in its first year.\n\nA not-so-secret weapon is its ability to be the exclusive streaming home to theatrical blockbusters from Marvel, Pixar, \u201cStar Wars,\u201d and the Disney studio. \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d will be available to stream Dec. 11. What is more, Disney+\u2019s original programming feeds off its big-budget franchises. Original Marvel shows, for example, will be closely wedded to storylines that play out on the big screen in theaters. The upcoming live-action, big-budget series \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d is a \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff.\n\nDisney\u2019s Iger has proclaimed Disney+ as the future of the company, and Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne projects the company could have more than 130 million subscribers across its online video services worldwide by 2024. In a June note, Swinburne said he expects Disney to sign 13 million subscribers by the end of 2020, which would give it 50 million total subscribers across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no true \u2018Netflix killer\u2019 on the market, Disney\u2019s upcoming bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ probably comes closest,\u201d says Eric Haggstrom, forecasting analyst at eMarketer.\n\nNetflix\u2019s stock has slumped 22% over the past 12 months, while shares of Disney have rallied 14%, and of Amazon\u2019s has lost 8.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.36% has tacked on 0.5%.", "description": "The start of the traditional fall TV season in late September has been teeming with ads for new streaming services from Apple Inc. and Walt Disney Co., both...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS419_Disney_ZG_20191001131908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
