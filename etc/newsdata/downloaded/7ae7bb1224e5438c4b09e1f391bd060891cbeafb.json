Another group of birds called little grebe were a little over 1,000.\n\nThese birds are among dozens of species expected to grace major wetlands in the country in a phenomenon expected to last through to December.\n\nEnthusiasts have taken to an online forum known as Spring Alive, which is a platform that brings together residents of several counties as they track and document the various birds sighted.\n\nSpring Alive began as a European project and was extended to Africa in 2010, where from September onwards enthusiasts look out for the return of bird species from their breeding grounds in Europe and Asia.\n\nThis helps to create a real-time map of the incredible journeys these birds take every year.\n\nEnthusiasts, experts, and tourists are expected to pitch camp at the Tugumoi Ridge flyway, west of Lake Bogoria, which forms part of the African-Eurasian flyway circuit, to watch as raptors and storks glide over the Rift skies from Egypt and other African countries.\n\nA flyway is a flight path used by large numbers of birds while migrating between their breeding grounds and their wintering grounds. Flyways generally span continents and often pass over oceans.\n\n\u201cIt is often an interesting time when bird watchers come together to witness the spectacle unfold on some set dates. A live feed linking several countries is usually key in updating visitors on the exact dates to expect the spectacle in certain points,\u201d Kimaru said.\n\nNature Kenya communication officer John Mwacharo said this season\u2019s Afro-Eurasian migration came earlier than expected with several regions across the country recording sightings in the just concluded water-bird counts.\n\n\u201cWater-bird counts are usually conducted during January and July/August just after the migration. This month, we have started receiving recordings which we are updating in Spring Alive where citizens record birds they have spotted to allow for data analysis and tracking,\u201d Mr Mwacharo said.\n\nA peek into Spring Alive under the Kenyan category reveals several sightings of white storks spotted in Rift Valley, Eurasian bee-eaters spotted in Mount Kenya and barn swallows spotted in parts of northern Kenya.\n\nThe birds make the journey despite the growing environmental pressures arising from deforestation and pollution.\n\nOn October 12, bird lovers celebrated World Migratory Bird Day whose theme this year was \u201cProtect Birds: Be the Solution to Plastic Pollution!\u201d The event highlighted the impact of plastic pollution on migratory birds and their habitats.\n\nThis article is reproduced here as part of the Giants Club African Conservation Journalism Fellowships, a programme of the charity Space for Giants and supported by the owner of ESI Media, which includes independent.co.uk.
