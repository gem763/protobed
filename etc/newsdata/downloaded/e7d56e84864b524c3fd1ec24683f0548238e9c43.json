After ripping Mike Pompeo for misleading reporters over his participation in the Donald Trump-Volodymyr Zelensky call, Kessler turns his fact-check guns on Adam Schiff and his repeated representations that he and his staff had no contact with the whistleblower who exposed it. This wasn\u2019t just misleading, Kessler concludes, but at least one flat-out lie by Schiff.\n\nOn September 17th in a Morning Joe segment, Schiff asserted that his committee had never directly been in contact with the whistleblower:\n\nSam Stein: \u201cHave you heard from the whistleblower? Do you want to hear from the whistleblower? What protections could you provide to the whistleblower?\u201d \u2026 Schiff: \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to. But I am sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just how he is supposed to communicate with Congress, and so the risk to the whistleblower is retaliation.\u201d This is flat-out false. Unlike the quick two-step dance he performed with Anderson Cooper, Schiff simply says the committee had not spoken to the whistleblower. Now we know that\u2019s not true.\n\nSchiff also lied two days later in a presser, Kessler continues, when Schiff declared that his committee might never have heard about the whistleblower if it hadn\u2019t been for the IG. Kessler calls that \u201cdissembling,\u201d as the New York Times explained that Schiff \u201cknew to press for the complaint when the Trump administration initially blocked lawmakers from seeing it.\u201d Schiff\u2019s spokesperson tries to sell the idea that Schiff didn\u2019t realize that this was the same whistleblower, which Kessler concludes \u201cstrains credulity.\u201d\n\nThere are right ways and wrong ways to answer reporters\u2019 questions if a politician wants to maintain his or her credibility. There\u2019s nothing wrong with dodging a question, as long as you don\u2019t try to mislead (as Pompeo did). But Schiff on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d clearly made a statement that was false. He now says he\u2019s was answering the wrong question, but if that was the case, he should have quickly corrected the record. He compounded his falsehood by telling reporters a few days later that if not for the IG\u2019s office, the committee would not have known about the complaint. That again suggested there had been no prior communication. The explanation that Schiff was not sure it was the same whistleblower especially strains credulity.\n\nKessler gives Schiff the maximum four Pinocchios for his lies about the origins of the whistleblower complaint. That leaves the man in charge of impeachment looking pretty bad, Phillips writes, although she chides him as gently as possible:\n\nPresident Trump is constantly grasping for anything to exploit to discredit his opponents as Democrats\u2019 early impeachment inquiry produces mounting problems for him. And House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the Democrats\u2019 face of the inquiry, has handed the president at least two things to yank on within as many weeks.", "description": "Cooked.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/schiff-stare.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
