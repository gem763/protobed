Photo: Courtesy of the vendor\n\nIf you\u2019re a regular of this website, you probably know that Instant Pot\u2019s claim to fame is it\u2019s line of cultish, multifunctional pressure cookers. But those aren\u2019t the brand\u2019s only kitchen appliances: It also has a line of versatile multicookers like this Aura Pro, which is a slow cooker that can be used to prepare many of the same things as the pressure cookers, just not as fast (pressure cookers cut down on cook time by heating to higher-than-boiling temperatures; slow cookers, as their name implies, do not). Still, you can use this 8-quart, 11-in-1 Aura Pro to make rice, yogurt, and entire family meals, plus you can (attempt to) sous vide with it, as well as prepare hearty roasts and stews to serve throughout the fall and winter. At $60 (or 80 percent off), this Aura Pro\u2019s price is the lowest we\u2019ve ever seen it. But it\u2019s not the only deal to be found right now at Sur La Table, which is slashing prices on everything from bakeware and knives to dining-room decor as part of an extensive warehouse sale that ends October 21.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
