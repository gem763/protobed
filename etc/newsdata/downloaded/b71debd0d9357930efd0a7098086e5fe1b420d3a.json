Unai Emery has the edge in this particular managerial rivalry over the last few years.

Every time is a good time to play against them with our supporters. Maybe this match on Sunday is the best match in the world [this weekend] for all football supporters.\" Advertisement There's an obvious area of the pitch for Arsenal to exploit today, particularly given the quality of their front three. Davinson Sanchez is starting at right back for Spurs, a position he is not entirely familiar with. It'll be interesting to see how he copes this afternoon. The players are out at the Emirates! Kick off is just a couple of minutes away now... KICK OFF Spurs get the first North London derby of the season underway! Advertisement Arsenal 0-0 Tottenham 1 minute A lively start from the hosts! Aubameyang sends Kolasinac away down the left with a lovely flick, and the full back picks out Pepe in the middle. He finds space on his left foot and shoots, but his effort flies over the bar. It's taken just a minute for Sanchez to be caught out at right back. Arsenal 0-0 Tottenham 5 minutes It's been a predictably high intensity start from Arsenal. Tottenham are looking to manage the opening stages but they're being penned back into their own half, forced into some early defending. Kolasinac again finds his way past Sanchez, but the Spurs defender recovers. Arsenal get a corner, though, from which Maitland-Niles fires off a shot from the edge of the box. It's blocked well by Kane. Arsenal 0-0 Tottenham 10 minutes Lacazette latches onto a loose ball on the edge of the Tottenham box and gets a shot off. But he doesn't connect well, dragging it wide of the far post. Spurs look unconvincing defensively here. GOAL! GOAL! Arsenal 0-1 Tottenham (Eriksen) 11 minutes It's been all Arsenal in the opening ten minutes, but they find themselves behind! Spurs break quickly and Son sets Lamela through on goal. His low shot is saved by Leno, but he parries the ball straight into the path of Eriksen, who has a tap in. Against the run of play, Tottenham lead. Advertisement Arsenal 0-1 Tottenham 14 minutes Tottenham have been buoyed by that goal. They look a real threat when they come forward now. Arsenal's fragile defence has been exposed again. Arsenal 0-1 Tottenham 15 minutes Eriksen is up for this. He drives at the Arsenal back four, cuts inside and unleashes a powerful shot. It's straight at Leno, who makes a comfortable save. Arsenal 0-1 Tottenham 18 minutes Brilliant save from Leno! Spurs break quickly again, releasing Son who makes his way into the box. His curling shot looks set for the top corner, but Leno flies to his left, pushing it behind for a corner. Arsenal 0-1 Tottenham 23 minutes Arsenal are regaining some control of the game after that shaky spell following the goal. And they create their first chance since going behind. Aubameyang runs at Sanchez and sends a cross to the back post where Pepe is waiting. Rose makes a crucial block to deny the Frenchman.
