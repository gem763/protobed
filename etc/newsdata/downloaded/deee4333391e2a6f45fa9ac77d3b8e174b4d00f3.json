Will It Step In Again for a New Populist President?", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nThe next big date on Argentina\u2019s financial trauma calendar is Sept. 15. That\u2019s when the International Monetary Fund decides whether to lend the beleaguered nation another $5.4 billion. An ordinary lender might close its wallet just after the $44 billion it has already poured into Argentina was \u201creprofiled\u201d\u2014that is, Buenos Aires unilaterally stretched out the payment schedule.\n\nBut an IMF freezeout could turn an emergency into a catastrophe on the ground, and signal failure for the biggest bailout in the fund\u2019s own history. \u201cThere could be a run on the banks as people withdraw dollars from their accounts for fear of having them frozen,\u201d says Hector Torres, an Argentine former executive director at the IMF now at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.\n\nTough choice.\n\nIn your typical emerging market debt crisis, a government struggles to meet private-sector loans, then the IMF steps in as honest broker and last-resort lender. This time is different. IMF boss Christine Lagarde, who coincidentally steps down on Sept. 12 to head the European Central Bank, led a gargantuan rescue effort in early 2018 aimed at bankrolling the reforms of President Mauricio Macri.\n\nThat came unglued when Macri was crushed in a primary election this past Aug. 11 by Peronist opponent Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez. The Argentine peso has dropped 20% since then, the country\u2019s $100 billion-plus in dollar bonds are trading around 40% of par, and Macri had to reinstate capital controls, negating his key policy achievement.\n\nA few accommodating noises from Fern\u00e1ndez, who looks all but certain to succeed Macri after general elections on Oct. 27, would help the IMF stay engaged. The 60-year-old technocrat is seen as pragmatic by nature, and respected economist Guillermo Nielsen is emerging as his key advisor. \u201cNielsen is a reasonably well-prepared economist who will not want to do crazy things,\u201d says Claudio Loser, a former director of the IMF\u2019s Western Hemisphere department who now heads the Centennial Group consultancy.\n\nBut Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s public statements remain uncompromising. \u201cWhat I want the IMF to understand is that they are guilty of this situation,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt was an act of complicity with the Macri administration.\u201d He promised a \u201cplan to boost consumption\u201d by raising wages and pensions, despite inflation that was in the 50% range before devaluation.\n\nInvestors see Argentina and the fund as locked in a marriage, even if it\u2019s headed for a rocky patch. The country tried divorce once, defaulting without IMF participation in 2001 and forcing creditors to accept 25 cents on the dollar. That worked reasonably well until 2008 as grain exports rode the commodities supercycle. But the postcrisis years brought stagflation and, in 2015, the election of Macri, Argentina\u2019s first pro-business leader in decades.\n\nComplicit or not, markets will keep looking to the fund as a barometer of confidence in Argentina, and anti-IMF posturing is costing Fern\u00e1ndez precious time, says Siobhan Morden, an analyst who specializes in sovereign crises at Amherst Pierpont Securities. \u201cFern\u00e1ndez doesn\u2019t look like he has a team or a plan,\u201d she says. \u201cTen people can argue 10 different scenarios, but the range of recovery value is probably declining.\u201d\n\nIf the debt math dictates peace with the fund, political arithmetic demands more warlike rhetoric. Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s vice-presidential running mate is Cristina Kirchner, the creditor-hostile president who preceded Macri, and he doesn\u2019t want to kick off his presidency by betraying her voters. \u201cThe best scenario is he goes to the fund after some fireworks,\u201d Loser says. \u201cI give it a 50% chance.\u201d\n\nEmail: editors@barrons.com", "description": "The South American country has a long history with the international lender, including $44 billion to back President Mauricio Macri\u2019s reforms.
