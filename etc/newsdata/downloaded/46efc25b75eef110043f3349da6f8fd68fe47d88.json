Anyone who has the temerity to break the mould of what has previously been established and expected often, unfortunately, receives criticism and bile that I don\u2019t understand. We\u2019ve seen this pattern repeatedly. I don\u2019t know her, but as someone who respects her, I\u2019m so grateful that she persists, and is unbowed, and is doing work she feels called to do. And also isn\u2019t willing to be bullied.\u201d", "description": "The former first lady and her daughter were giving an interview to promote a book on \u201cgutsy women.\u201d", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571046563/GettyImages-1173714060_kteh8h", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
