The budget gap widened 26% in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, to $984 billion from $779 billion deficit the previous year, the Treasury said, as rising government outlays continued to outpace tax collection.\n\nAnnual deficits have risen 68% since 2016 during a period of historically low unemployment and stronger wage gains. Tax cuts restrained revenue growth last year, and a bipartisan budget deal ramped up government spending. Deficits are on track to exceed $1 trillion a year over the coming decades and would rise higher if the economy weakens.\n\nDeficits usually shrink during economic expansions as rising household income and corporate profits boost government tax revenues, while spending for safety-net programs, such as unemployment insurance or food stamps, declines.\n\nAs a share of economic output, deficits totaled 4.6% in fiscal 2019, up from 3.8% in 2018, the Treasury said. Revenues as a share of gross domestic product fell last year, to 16.3% from 16.4% in the previous fiscal year, while federal outlays surged, to 20.9% of GDP from 20.2% the previous year.\n\n\"This administration came into office talking about reducing deficits, and the results have been the exact opposite,\" said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former Republican congressional budget aide.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that President Trump's economic agenda is working, pointing to the job market and paycheck growth.\n\n\"In order to truly put America on a sustainable financial path, we must enact proposals -- like the president's 2020 budget plan -- to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending,\" Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement accompanying the latest figures.\n\nTax revenue rebounded in fiscal 2019, following steep declines in corporate tax revenue and flat individual tax receipts last year following tax cuts enacted in 2017.\n\nThe Treasury said Friday corporate tax receipts increased 12% in the fiscal year ending in September, while individual income tax revenue rose 3%. Most of those gains came in the second half of the year, a senior Treasury official said.\n\nCorporate tax revenue was $60 billion in September, a month when companies made required payments. That is up 43% from September 2018, providing further indication that companies may have done maneuvers that reduced their tax liabilities in the first year of the new tax law even more than anticipated.\n\nHigher tax revenues weren't enough to offset federal spending. Increases in interest rates and a bigger government debt load pushed up interest costs by 10%, to $573 billion. Medicare spending also rose 10% to $783 billion, due to rising enrollment and higher health-care costs, a senior Treasury official said, and spending on the military climbed 8%, to $654 billion.\n\nThe fiscal 2019 deficit eclipsed $1 trillion through August, but fell in September, when the government typically records a surplus as corporations make quarterly tax payments.\n\nLong-term costs associated with an aging population, including higher Social Security and Medicare spending, are also expected to continue pushing up deficits over the coming decades.\n\nThose deficits have led the Treasury to ramp up borrowing in recent years. The government has said it expects to borrow more than $1 trillion for the second year in a row in 2019. The president and his advisers have privately discussed refocusing on cutting spending in his second term, according to aides.\n\nRichard Rubin\n\ncontributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 25, 2019 17:04 ET (21:04 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
