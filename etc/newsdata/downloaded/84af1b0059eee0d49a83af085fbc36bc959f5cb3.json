They also are talking about having the whistleblower sit behind a screen or partition. A third option being floated includes audio-only testimony.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics House-Democrats-Consider-Masking-Identity-Of-Whistleblower-From-Trumps-Gop-Allies-In-Congress Https"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
