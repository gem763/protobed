I\u2019m in dreadful pain and need to take morphine almost every day. I just want to get it removed and get on with my life.\"\n\nAnd she added: \u201cEven if people aren\u2019t a match for me, they could help other people like me.\u201d\n\n(Image: Copy Media)\n\nFriend Carly Lou Grimes who made the Facebook appeal with Tara said: \u201cTara has had this growth for three years and we are desperate for it to be removed, so I made the appeal with her to encourage Afro-Caribbean people who are willing to give blood to come forward and help her.\n\n\u201cTara lives in fear of the tumour bursting and I have watched my best friend go from a bubbly, hippy chick who loves life into someone who looks and behaves like an old lady.\n\n\"She is so ill. She takes chemotherapy tablets to help control the sickle cell which already causes her weakness, but we want to get the mass removed so she can try to get her life back.\n\n\u201cShe struggles to get out of bed at the moment \u2013 not least because this has damaged her mental health so badly and she has lost all her confidence and self-esteem \u2013 but because of her illness and the tumour.\n\n\u201cSo if anyone can help, please come forward.\u201d\n\nTara, who has two teenage daughters Tyler and Darcy, was born with sickle cell anaemia, a disorder of the blood caused by an inherited abnormal haemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein within the red blood cells) which is particularly common in people with an African or Caribbean family background.\n\n(Image: Copy Media)\n\nPeople with sickle cell disease produce unusually shaped red blood cells that can cause problems because they do not live as long as healthy blood cells and can block blood vessels. Symptoms include tiredness, pain and infection.\n\nThe tumour grew following a replacement hip operation which, her family says, caused fragments of her hip to go into Tara\u2019s leg.\n\nIt has slowly grown and is now moving towards her stomach and getting bigger and bigger.\n\nTara says the operation would need to be in two parts: one to remove the hip joint and the tumour, followed be a second to replace the hip joint once an infection she has got has gone.\n\nThe former make-up artist said: \u201cIt\u2019s a scary operation, it\u2019s a big operation, but it will be worth it to get my life back.\n\n\u201cThe longer I have to wait, the more I lose hope. The waiting is bringing me down and I feel more and more unwell. I\u2019m in constant agony, and the size of the tumour is even causing me back pain. The morphine helps most of the time but when it doesn\u2019t I have to go into hospital.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s difficult trying to find a match but I have to believe there\u2019s one out there. I would just ask people, if they can, to help so that I can get back to living a normal life with my daughters, and so I can start living again.\u201d\n\n(Image: Copy Media)\n\nTara\u2019s father died at 42 because of sickle cell and family members say they don\u2019t want her to die at 42, or even before, simply because of a lack of blood that her body won\u2019t reject, and which stops the operation from being performed.\n\nThe operation itself is life-threatening, they add, but it at least gives her the chance of a normal life again, rather than living in pain and fear.\n\nDr Tristan Cope, medical director for Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: \u201cWe are sorry about the situation and understand how difficult this must be for the patient. They have a complex condition and we are working with the patient to provide the best possible care.\n\n\u201cWe cannot comment on specific patient details for confidentiality reasons. In general, patients who have had many blood transfusions can develop antibodies which make future transfusions more complex.\n\n\u201cWe have had a number of people volunteering to donate blood at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. As the hospital is not a blood donation centre, we cannot accept donations here. If you would like to donate blood, please register to become a blood donor at www.blood.co.uk .\u201d\n\n(Image: Copy Media)\n\nDr Therese Callaghan, Consultant Haematologist at NHS Blood and Transplant, said: \u201cOur hearts go out to Ms McGrath. Sadly, there is a shortage of black and mixed ethnicity people donating blood.\n\n\u201cThis makes it very difficult to find well matched blood for people with sickle cell disease if they have developed a significant number of antibodies. We need more black and mixed ethnicity people to donate blood.\n\n\u201cYou can register as a new donor. If your blood is not a match for Ms McGrath, it will still save or improve the life of another seriously ill patient.\u201d\n\nCarly Lou added: \u201cTo anyone who does register or offer blood, I\u2019d like to say thank you on behalf of myself and Tara's family.\u201d", "description": "Tara McGrath, 35, developed the massive tumour on her leg after a replacement hip operation which, her family says, caused fragments of her hip to go into Tara\u2019s leg", "authors": ["Janet Tansley", "Image", "Copy Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20759021.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-THP_CHP_301019SLUG_7361JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
