A Secret Service investigation led authorities to the man's home, where they found 277 rounds of 9 mm ammunition, a Glock pistol and a Colt rifle with a bump stock attached.\n\nInvestigators later discovered that Dhingra had previously been committed to a mental institution and is prohibited by federal law of possessing a firearm or ammunition, the DOJ said in a statement.\n\nRick Bowmer/AP, File\n\n\"The four-count indictment, returned yesterday, alleges Ajay Dhingra possessed a machine gun, made two materially false statements in the acquisition of two firearms and unlawfully possessed a firearm after having been adjudicated as a mental defective or who had been committed to a mental institution,\" the statement said.\n\nThe case is believed to be the first involving illegal possession of bump stocks since the law was implemented in March 2019.\n\nBump stocks were banned amid national outcry after a gunman used the device to carry out a mass shooting at an October 2017 music festival in Las Vegas, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more.\n\nDhingra is scheduled to appear for arraignment on Sept. 12.\n\nHe could face up to 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted as charged.\n\nABC News' Alex Mallin contributed to this report.", "description": "The case is believed to be the first involving illegal possession of bump stocks since the law was implemented in March 2019.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/bump-stock-ap-mo-20190905_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
