Lower mortgage rates, and improving mortgage availability have supported the growth in numbers across the country.'", "description": "Analysis from Zoopla found that two thirds of those looking to buy their first homes are seeking houses rather than flats, rising to 80 per cent outside of London.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
