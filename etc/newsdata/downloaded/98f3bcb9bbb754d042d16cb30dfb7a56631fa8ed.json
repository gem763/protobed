Photo: NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images\n\nJoseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, went before the House Intelligence Committee Thursday to discuss his handling of a whistle-blower complaint that raises concerns over President Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine\u2019s president and led Democrats to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump this week.\n\nA declassified version of the complaint was released to Congress on Wednesday and, minutes before Maguire\u2019s testimony, House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff released it to the public. \u201cThis complaint should never have been withheld, and it provides a roadmap for our investigation,\u201d Schiff wrote in a tweet. \u201cWe will do everything we can to protect this courageous whistle-blower. The public has a right to see the complaint and what it reveals.\u201d\n\nThe complaint alleges that Trump is \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d It also says there was an attempt to cover up Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nBelow are live updates from Maguire\u2019s testimony, with the most recent developments first:\n\nSchiff gets the money quote.\n\nAfter pressing Maguire on how he handled the whistle-blower report, Schiff turned to the person who blew the whistle. Is that person a \u201cpolitical hack,\u201d as Trump has said, Schiff asked? Maguire danced around the answer before providing the quote that Schiff was no doubt looking for: \u201cI believe the whistle-blower did the right thing.\u201d\n\nJUST IN: Acting DNI Joseph Maguire: \"I believe the whistleblower did the right thing.\" https://t.co/fUBRdsHDCG pic.twitter.com/jH2SLmMcTd \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 26, 2019\n\nMaguire defends himself \u2014 and the whistle-blower.\n\n\u201cI am not partisan, and I am not political,\u201d acting DNI Maguire told the committee in his opening statement. He pushed back against criticism for not previously giving the committee the whistle-blower complaint, saying that the White House counsel\u2019s office told him it was a matter of executive privilege. That is a \u201cprivilege that I do not have the authority to wave,\u201d he said.\n\nMaguire also said the whistle-blower and Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, \u201cacted with good faith throughout.\u201d He added: \u201cI have every reason to believe that they have done everything by the book and followed the law.\u201d\n\nDevin Nunes defends Trump and trashes Democrats.\n\nNunes, the lead Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, previewed the argument that many Trump allies are sure to make at today\u2019s hearing. He compared the whistle-blower complaint to the Steele Dossier, brought up the \u201cRussia hoax\u201d and \u201cfake news,\u201d and accused Democrats of trying to obtain nude pictures of Trump from Ukraine.\n\nHere's Devin Nunes accusing Democrats of trying to obtain nude pictures of Trump pic.twitter.com/pRF7UHijpq \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 26, 2019\n\nAdam Schiff says Trump \u201cbetrayed his oath of office.\u201d\n\nSchiff began Thursday\u2019s testimony with an opening statement in which he said that the summary of the phone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is \u201cthe most graphic evidence yet that the president of the United States has betrayed his oath of office.\u201d The call, Schiff said, \u201creads like a classic organized crime shakedown.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be funny it wasn\u2019t such a graphic betrayal of the president\u2019s oath of office.\u201d", "description": "Acting DNI Joseph Maguire spoke to Congress Thursday about the whistle-blower complaint concerning Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Adam K.
