Amid outcry, they\u2019ve been criminally charged.", "language": "en", "text": "Now, university officials say an investigation into the 11-second video, which started to widely circulate on social media earlier this month, has prompted campus police to arrest and charge two students Monday night with violating a Connecticut hate crime statute.\n\nJarred Karal and Ryan Mucaj, both 21 and described by police as white, were charged with ridicule on account of creed, religion, color, denomination, nationality or race. The misdemeanor charge is punishable by a maximum of 30 days in jail, a fine of up to $50 or both, according to state law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice found that the third person in the video did not participate in saying the racial slur, university spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz told The Washington Post. Reitz said the university is investigating whether Karal and Mucaj violated the student code of conduct, which could result in additional penalties as severe as expulsion.\n\n\u201cIt is supportive of our core values to pursue accountability, through due process, for an egregious assault on our community that has caused considerable harm,\u201d UConn President Thomas C. Katsouleas said in a statement late Monday.\n\nRecords did not indicate attorneys for Karal and Mucaj, who were released after promising to return for a scheduled court date on Oct. 30, according to the Hartford Courant.\n\nAD\n\nThe arrests come amid outcry from students demanding that administrators address racism and promote inclusion on the university\u2019s main campus in Storrs, Conn. Shortly after the parking-lot video went viral, another student alleged that two fraternity members used a racial slur against her at a party, the university\u2019s NAACP chapter wrote in a letter published this week. On Monday afternoon, hundreds of students chanted, \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a word,\u201d during an on-campus march and rally, joining professors in calling for action, the Courant reported.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf the university does not adequately address and handle these occurrences of racism appropriately, it will create a culture in which racism is tolerated and normalized,\u201d the NAACP letter said. \u201cWe demand for your full assurance that you will take appropriate measures to hold the students involved in these heinous acts of racism accountable.\u201d\n\nAccording to an incident report, university authorities learned about the video on Oct. 11. In the clip, the people say the n-word to each other at least five times, getting louder with each iteration and laughing as they walk by student housing.\n\nCampus police later identified Karal and Mucaj as two of the individuals and discovered that the group had been playing \u201ca game in which they yelled vulgar words,\u201d the report said. When they reached the parking lot, police allege that Karal and Mucaj \u201cswitched to saying a racial epithet\u201d loud enough for two people inside the apartment complex to hear.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnce the video began to gain widespread attention, the backlash was instant.\n\n\u201cI really am still in shock at how it is 2019 and UConn is still riddled with VOCAL racists. not even closeted racists. VOCAL racists. I\u2019m disgusted,\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cWhite people think they\u2019re tired of hearing others complain about racism? How about how tired black uconn students feel?\u201d\n\nToo much racist energy at UConn yo. What\u2019s going on \u2014 Trey Trey (@Trey_Robinson_) October 13, 2019\n\nAmid the anger, there was an undercurrent of fear.\n\n\u201cI feel uncomfortable and scared on this campus at this point,\u201d Areon Mangan, a UConn student, told WTNH last week. \u201cWe want change. This is not fair to us. It\u2019s disrespectful and it\u2019s just not okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now everybody is on edge,\u201d Jakim Dease, who also attends the university, told the New Haven, Conn., station.\n\nAD\n\n\"I feel uncomfortable and scared on this campus.\" Black #UCONN students fearful & angry after two racist incidents in one week. #CTnews pic.twitter.com/GXj7HjRART \u2014 Mario Boone, Jou. (@MarioBooneTV) October 14, 2019\n\nIn a letter to students Friday, Katsouleas condemned the video and similar incidents as \u201cdeplorable and antithetical to the values of our community and the university as a whole.\u201d Katsouleas also announced that UConn was launching a nationwide search for its next chief diversity officer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is important that we remember that we get to decide who represents our community, and what behavior truly reflects who we are at UConn,\u201d Katsouleas wrote. \u201cTo me, the best among us represent who we are \u2014 the 99%-plus who are good citizens and share our values, not the few who don\u2019t. This is a choice we get to make.\u201d\n\nKatsouleas\u2019s statement, however, didn\u2019t quell the backlash.\n\nAD\n\nStudents @UConn marching in solidarity and raising their voices to end racism. @FOX61News pic.twitter.com/EqfkWgyG0f \u2014 Matt Caron (@MattCaronTV) October 21, 2019\n\nThe Daily Campus, UConn\u2019s student publication, posted an editorial Monday ripping administrators for their \u201cpainfully slow and underwhelming\u201d response to the video.\n\nSome faculty members were equally displeased.\n\n\u201cI have been a professor here for almost three decades and once again I find myself pleading with an apparently uncaring university administration to deal with the university\u2019s not so little white racism problem,\u201d sociology professor No\u00ebl A. Cazenave wrote in a letter to the editor published Monday in the Daily Campus.\n\nAD\n\nDavid Embrick, another sociology professor, also called on the university to take responsibility, delivering an impassioned speech during Monday\u2019s demonstration, the Daily Campus reported.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cInjustice anywhere is injustice,\u201d said Embrick, who donned a shirt bearing the words, \u201cWhite Supremacy is Terrorism.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe should do something about it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, UConn\u2019s NAACP chapter released a list of eight demands, which included updating the student code of conduct on racism and hate speech; protecting students who report such incidents; creating a mandatory course on diversity, racial discrimination and hate crimes; and hiring more black administrators, faculty, staff and police officers.\n\n\u201cI hope there is change,\u201d junior Kimberly Okeke told WVIT. \u201cI know it will take time. But with some of the policies they\u2019re thinking of implementing for spring 2020 I think there is a possibility that something great will happen.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "University of Connecticut police allege that Jarred Karal and Ryan Mucaj had been playing \u201ca game in which they yelled vulgar words\u201d when they switched to using the racial slur.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fSX9XI7692n1uX09FrhpXLoyLqw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/74GG56XUNYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
