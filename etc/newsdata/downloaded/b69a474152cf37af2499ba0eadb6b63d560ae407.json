He begins a news conference by announcing that \u201cit has been suggested I would be a suitable figure to absorb the anger and concern\u201d over the scandal and then, instead of reading from a prepared statement, turns the sentence on its head with a resounding, \u201cBut \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is that my father is a malignant presence, a bully and a liar, and he was fully personally aware of these events for many years and made efforts to hide and cover up,\u201d Kendall continues, adding that the patriarch had a \u201ctwisted sense of loyalty to bad actors.\u201d \u201cI think this is the day his reign ends.\"\n\nLogan, watching the presser on television, appears to smile slightly. Game recognizes game.\n\nMuch speculation followed Logan\u2019s assertion in the penultimate episode that the situation was dire enough to require a \u201cblood sacrifice,\u201d with most predictions boiling down to either Kendall or Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen), Logan\u2019s son-in-law and the head of cruises, winding up the sacrificial lamb. Logan faces that exact choice in the finale and chooses Kendall after (and only maybe because) the sole Roy daughter, Shiv (Sarah Snook), uncharacteristically pleads with Logan not to pick her husband.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe twist was not the choice Logan made but the fact that Kendall, deemed his father\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 boy,\u201d still has it in him to stick up for himself. At the presser, he rips the prepared statement apart with the same ferocity that once led him to try to stage a hostile takeover at Waystar Royco, before he became a robot who repeatedly droned, \u201cI saw their plan and my dad\u2019s was better.\u201d A nudge from his girlfriend, Naomi Pierce (Annabelle Dexter-Jones, playing a member of the rival media family), pushes Kendall to revert to the rebel some of us root for \u2014 rather perversely, given how horrible the Roys can be.\n\nSome might have seen this coming, given the notable loose end of Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) having saved a few papers proving that Logan had signed off on million-dollar settlements. And despite how immoral some of his past deeds have been, Kendall joins Greg in being one of the few \u201cSuccession\u201d characters who actually seems to wrestle with his conscience over calamities of this scale.\n\nBut the more compelling argument comes down to Kendall\u2019s relationship with Logan, and the screwed-up ways in which he both expresses and seeks his father\u2019s love. (Need we remind you of the absolutely bonkers \u201cL to the OG\u201d?) A drug-addled Kendall got into a Chappaquiddick-like car accident with a young waiter at Shiv and Tom\u2019s wedding and left him to drown, but being his father\u2019s No. 1 boy meant Logan would shield him from the fallout. Kendall spends the entire second season a shell of his former self, seeking punishment for the waiter\u2019s death while carrying out Logan\u2019s wishes \u2014 even the ones he disagrees with, like shuttering the website Vaulter \u2014 out of tormenting loyalty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA switch seems to flip after Logan declares that Kendall isn\u2019t a killer. He is one, in the literal sense of the word, and Logan\u2019s blatant disregard for the young waiter\u2019s life \u2014 he refers to the kid as \u201cN.R.P.I.,\u201d or \u201cno real person involved,\u201d a term used for the migrants and sex workers involved in the cruises scandal \u2014 reverberates. He no longer seems to regard his troubled son\u2019s well-being, either.\n\nAll this, after Naomi informs Kendall that Logan only loves \u201cthe broken you,\u201d and how else could that presser have unfolded? Kendall kissing his father\u2019s cheek before betraying him mirrors the hug Logan gave him in the first season finale, hours after the accident. Love is an expression of power in the Roy household, and for once, Kendall appears to have the upper hand.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Oh, Kendall.", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/98vwiSanmsOZrBLSsKsHM6heuC0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TORC5OMUZFFUBCVMWJOE6UWKKE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
