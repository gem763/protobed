The recent deaths across our country, combined with hundreds of reported lung injury cases continue to intensify,\" Secretary for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment Dr. Lee Norman said in a statement.\n\nOn Friday, the CDC announced that at least 450 total possible cases of vaping-related lung illnesses had been reported across 33 states this year, and other recent deaths have been tallied in Minnesota, California, Oregon, Illinois, and Indiana.\n\n\"While the investigation is ongoing, CDC has advised that individuals consider not using e-cigarettes, because as of now, this is the primary means of preventing the severe lung disease,\" Dr. Dana Meaney-Delman of the CDC said on a call with reporters Friday.\n\nIt's still not clear what's causing these life-threatening lung issues, but they tend to sprout up in a matter of days or weeks after people use e-cigarettes (though some of the people who've gotten sick said they'd been vaping for years before they fell ill).\n\nInitial symptoms often include shortness of breath, fever, nausea, gastrointestinal issues, and weight loss. Some symptoms can be debilitating enough to put people on life support, and many have had to be hooked up to machines that help them breathe. Other vapers have suffered collapsed lungs.\n\n\"One death from this outbreak is one death too many,\" Minnesota Commissioner of Health Jan Malcolm said in a release announcing the first death in that state on Friday.\n\nWhile no specific e-cigarette or vape juice has been linked to the illnesses, doctors and public-health officials have noticed that the illnesses tend to pop up among young people (and especially young men) who are vaping cannabinoids like THC. But adults are not being spared, either. At least half of the deaths reported so far have been in older adults.\n\nA striking number of cases are associated with \"Dank Vapes\"\n\n\"All of the patients that we saw had used or consumed THC through their vaping devices,\" Dr. Daniel Fox of WakeMed Health and Hospitals in North Carolina said on the CDC press call. \"That seemed to be a common feature.\"\n\nDoctors in Illinois and Wisconsin agreed. They studied 53 cases of vaping-related illnesses between April and August in those states and found that \"84% of the patients reported having used tetrahydrocannabinol products in e-cigarette devices,\" they wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine on Friday.\n\n\"The most common THC product that was reported was marketed under the 'Dank Vape' label,\" the study said. Twenty-four of 41 patients interviewed said they used Dank Vapes, which are emerging as a shadowy, black-market way to sell relatively cheap marijuana-based vapes in places where they may not be legal.\n\nRead More: Deadly vaping lung illnesses are cropping up across the US, and experts blame everything from vegetable oil to 'Dank Vapes'\n\n\"If you're thinking of purchasing one of these products off the street, out of the back of a car, out of a trunk, in an alley, or if you're going to go home and make modifications to the product yourself using something that you purchased from some third party or got from a friend, think twice,\" Mitch Zeller, the director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said on the call.", "description": "More than 450 total possible vape-injury cases have popped up across the country, and at least six people have died after vaping.", "authors": ["Hilary Brueck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rUSUnUUW4.EeqNMkLcDqVQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/2c610c8878e1041051f2d7c7956197c9", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
