Institutions often go into the market to borrow cash in return for a loan of Treasurys. Starting last Monday, they found that cash was scarce and that the overnight rate on Treasury repurchase agreements had surged.\n\nThis quickly spilled over into other markets. For instance, the Fed\u2019s benchmark federal funds interest rate traded outside the central bank\u2019s preferred range for one day.\n\nIt was the first bout of significant market unrest for Williams, who took over as head of the New York Fed in June 2018, after a long career as a Fed economist and head of the regional Fed bank in San Francisco. The reviews of his performance from market participants have not been kind.\n\nInvestors said the central bank should have stepped in as soon as last Monday to arrest the surge in overnight borrowing costs.\n\nSee: Wall Street raises questions about Fed\u2019s late action on funding squeeze\n\nWhile defending his bank\u2019s performance, Williams also said he would focus on how banks might have contributed to the problems in the funding markets. \u201cIt is ... important that we examine these recent market dynamics and their implications for the liquidity needs in relation to the overall amount of reserves held at the Federal Reserve,\u201d Williams said.\n\nIn a Bloomberg television interview Monday, former New York Fed President Bill Dudley came to Williams\u2019s defense. \u201cIt\u2019s not one person at the top of the Federal Reserve that does this,\u201d Dud;ey said. \u201cThere\u2019s hundreds and hundreds of qualified people who execute monetary policy for the Federal Reserve.\u201d\n\nThe Fed might have responded a little sooner but, in the scheme of things, this will end up being seen as a flash in the pan, Dudley said.\n\n\u201cWhere are we today? We\u2019re in a good place. Repo rates are now down to where they should be. The federal funds rate is well within its range. So, mission accomplished, as far as I can see,\u201d he said.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the market unrest had no impact on the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet. That might also have contributed to the market unrest. Powell said the Fed would review its balance-sheet policy at its next meeting.\n\nDudley said the Fed could build up a buffer by increasing its balance sheet and set up a standing repo facility that banks could tap for funding whenever there is upward pressure on short-term rates.\n\nLate last week, the New York Fed announced it would conduct daily repurchase operations through Oct. 10 to provide temporary injections of liquidity into the market.", "description": "New York Fed President John Williams defended the way his bank handled turmoil in the money-markets last week.
