But those early morning wake-up calls still haunt him.\n\n\"Maybe my body is rejecting the idea [of waking up early], I know my mind does,\" he says.\n\nThese days, Rippon has retired from skating and is focusing on personal projects, including a book out in October and a YouTube channel. His day starts whenever he stops hitting snooze, which is usually at 8 or 9 a.m.\n\n\"If you're in the double-digits, you're taking it too far,\" he says.\n\nWhen he wakes up, the first thing Rippon does is check his phone to read the news on Twitter and check out Instagram.", "description": "Olympic figure skater and medal winner Adam Rippon tells CNBC Make It that he's absolutely not a morning person.
