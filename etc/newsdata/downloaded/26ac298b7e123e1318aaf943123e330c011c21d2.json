By comparison, the aborted July float was aiming for a forward EV/EBITDA of up to 18.2 times.\n\nThe new valuation is cheaper than the 23.5 times forward EV/EBITDA that its rival China Resources Beer Holdings commands.\n\nBudweiser said last week it had lined up Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC to invest $1 billion in the IPO as its cornerstone investor, lending some stability to the IPO. It did not have a cornerstone investor during the July float attempt.\n\nA successful completion of the Budweiser IPO, though, could encourage more Hong Kong IPO candidates to firm up their plans. China\u2019s biggest e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd delayed last month its up to $15 billion listing in the city amid the growing political unrest there.\n\nMore IPOs will be a boost for Hong Kong as a listings hub, with the city currently lagging its New York rivals. Companies raised $10.8 billion in new listings in Hong Kong as of mid-September, well short of the $41 billion raised in New York, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe Budweiser IPO included a rare \u201cupsize\u201d option that enabled the Belgium-based brewer to sell up to 36.8% more shares in the offering. That option was partially exercised, it said.\n\nProceeds from the IPO will help AB InBev reduce debt of over $100 billion accumulated following the purchase of rival SABMiller in late 2016. The stock of Budweiser will debut on Sept. 30.\n\nThe brewer also has another goal - creating an Asian champion to spur consolidation.\n\nAnalysts see the brewing assets of San Miguel of the Philippines or of ThaiBev as possible partners or targets.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Anheuser-Busch InBev is pictured outside the brewer's headquarters in Leuven, Belgium February 28, 2019.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Chinese investment bank CICC are the global coordinators for the offering.\n\nTopsports, the largest sportswear retailer in China, is set to price its IPO on Oct. 3 and trading of its shares is scheduled to start on Oct 10.\n\nTopsports declined to comment on its IPO.", "description": "Brewer AB InBev priced the Hong Kong IPO of its Asia-Pacific unit at the bottom of a marketed range to raise about $5 billion, indicating deals in the pipeline may need subdued valuations to succeed as protests in the city unnerve investors.", "authors": ["Julie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433210875&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N036", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
