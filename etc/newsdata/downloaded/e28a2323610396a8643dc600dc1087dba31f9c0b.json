In a briefing with reporters on the system, an official said the law didn\u2019t just apply to lobbyists, but also to business executives who may get requests from foreign governments for help with policy-related objectives.\n\n\u201cNobody should think, \u2018I\u2019m not a lobbyist or lawyer, therefore I don\u2019t have to abide by the statute,\u2019\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John Demers. \u201cThere are nontraditional groups that need to be careful of the statute and what they are asked to do by foreign governments.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, entered the spotlight in the midst of former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nWhile much of the focus has been on some of Washington\u2019s most familiar professional groups\u2014including lawyers, political consultants and public relations firms\u2014lawyers who advise on the foreign agent law say corporate executives in nonpolitical sectors also should be on notice.\n\n\u201cThis is not an issue just for lobbying firms and public relations firms because FARA sweeps very broadly and applies to corporations as well nonprofit groups,\u201d said Robert Kelner, a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling LLP. \u201cThey\u2019re all in the crosshairs.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelner, who said he has advised on the foreign agents law for more than 20 years, previously represented former President Trump national security adviser Mike Flynn, one of the targets of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. Mr. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in December 2017, admitted to making false statements on government forms about his work on behalf of Turkey.\n\nThe Justice Department decided to step up enforcement of the foreign agents law in 2015. It says its efforts will lead to a doubling in the number of registrants annually as of 2016, if current rates continue.\n\nYet despite a promising start that led to Mr. Flynn\u2019s guilty plea and another by former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort \u2014who pleaded guilty in 2018 to a conspiracy related to his failure to register under FARA for his work on behalf of Ukraine\u2014the department has suffered several recent setbacks.\n\nA federal judge Tuesday overturned the conviction of a former business partner to Mr. Flynn. The same day, prosecutors told defense attorneys that they had closed probes into two Washington lobbying firms and wouldn\u2019t bring criminal charges.\n\nThose developments came three weeks after jurors acquitted Democratic lawyer Gregory Craig of a charge that he lied to the unit that enforces the foreign agent law.\n\nResponding to the setbacks Wednesday, Mr. Demers said the Justice Department was still committed to rooting out covert foreign influence. He said the department was weighing its next steps with respect to the judge\u2019s ruling in the case against Mr. Flynn\u2019s business partner, Bijan Kian, who was convicted in July of conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of Turkey.\n\nAn official who leads the unit charged with enforcing the foreign agent law told a group of lawyers Wednesday that the Justice Department was focused on improving compliance through education and awareness, in addition to building criminal and civil cases. Law firms and other entities need to make sure FARA is one of the statutes they take into account when designing compliance policies and procedures, said Brandon Van Grack, a veteran prosecutor whose appointment was announced by Mr. Demers in March. Mr. Van Grack previously served on Mr. Mueller\u2019s special counsel team.\n\nMr. Kelner and other lawyers who advise on FARA also maintain that the focus on foreign agents would continue.\n\n\u201cWith FARA, we\u2019re in that early stage where companies just now are beginning to realize it applies to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a minefield for multinational corporations that have contacts with foreign governments.\u201d\n\nWrite to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com", "description": "Efforts to ramp up enforcement of a statute requiring the disclosure of political work done for foreign governments could have implications for corporate executives.", "authors": ["Dylan Tokar"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111036/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
