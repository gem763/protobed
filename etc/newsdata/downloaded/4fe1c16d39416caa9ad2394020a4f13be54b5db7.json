He will be given one task, to convert that play off position into promotion.\n\nAlthough there was strong support for Wycombe Wanderers boss Gareth Ainsworth in the Sunderland boardroom because of his impressive work, sources have told Telegraph Sport that Parkinson edged ahead because he has more experience of managing at big clubs with high expectations in League One.\n\nParkinson has also managed in the Championship and it was felt he would be better equipped to operate at that level should Sunderland return to the second tier.\n\nParkinson took Colchester out of League One as a rookie manager and did the same with Bolton Wanderers two years ago. Although he could not manage to lift either Charlton or Bradford City back into the second tier, the 51-year-old took the latter to a League Cup final and won promotion from League Two.", "description": "Phil Parkinson is set to be confirmed as the new manager of Sunderland on Thursday after holding a series of successful meetings with the club over the last few days.", "authors": ["Luke Edwards"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000056794957-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJWBvcrDmoqpXJdB8zqkRAMQUqA48acAUEMH9uCShiHI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
