I\u2019m slightly baffled by it, I\u2019ve never felt like a Wolverine sort of guy.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhilst the Welsh actor may not feel best suited to the role physically yet, Egerton still gave fans a glimmer of hope that he might be ready to play the rugged character in a few years time, adding that he would \u2018love\u2019 to join the MCU.\n\nHe added: \u2018I think that one\u2019s a few years away. I know that Kevin [Feige\u2019s] spoken about it being a few years away.\n\n\u2018Maybe in a few years I\u2019ll look rough enough for it. I\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I\u2019m a fan of those fans and of course I would, I would love to be a part of them.\u2019\n\nTaron doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s \u2018rough enough\u2019 to play Wolverine yet (Picture: Moviestore/REX)\n\nWhile Egerton might be staying tight-lipped about Wolverine, the Welshman is hoping to reprise his role as Eggsy in the final installment of the Kingsman franchise.\n\nTaron, who credits the film as the kickstarter to his acting career, expressed \u2018a great fondness\u2019 to playing the role again.\n\n\u2018I would like to do one more because frankly, I\u2019d like to say goodbye to him [Eggsy] in a befitting way and to finish the trilogy. All good things come to an end.\n\n\u2018It was always imagined as a trilogy and I think it\u2019d be great to finish the story off because I\u2019ve loved playing the character.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuess we\u2019ll have to wait a little while until we hear news of either movies, eh Taron?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
