Here it is.", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to 2020 Vision, the Yahoo News column covering the presidential race with one key takeaway every weekday and a wrap-up each weekend. Reminder: There are 105 days until the Iowa caucuses and 379 days until the 2020 election.\n\nStop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before. Candidate has a strong debate performance. Media blathers about how candidate had a strong debate performance. Candidate rises in the polls. Media wonders aloud whether candidate can win it all.\n\nIt happened to Kamala Harris during the summer. Now it\u2019s starting to happen to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was widely proclaimed one of the \u201cwinners\u201d of last week\u2019s Democratic primary debate in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nBut while Harris, now consigned to also-ran status, never really had a plausible path to the nomination, Buttigieg might.\n\nAs the first test (February\u2019s Iowa caucuses) nears, several forces are shaping the race in ways that could benefit Buttigieg, and even propel him to victory, if everything breaks in his favor.\n\nThe first is that his message and delivery last Thursday resonated with voters. When Buttigieg, 37, launched his campaign earlier this year, he emphasized the idea of generational change, claiming that as someone who would \u201creach the current age of the current president in the year 2054,\u201d he and only he had the vision to propose and implement the sort of bold, non-incrementalist policies that could safeguard America\u2019s future.\n\nPete Buttigieg at a town hall in Iowa.

If you want the candidate with the most years in Washington, you\u2019ve got a clear choice. For everybody else, I just might be your person,\u201d Buttigieg said over the weekend. \u201cI think we saw that space opening up.\"\n\nAccording to the data, Buttigieg\u2019s gambit worked. In a poll by Ipsos and FiveThirtyEight that tracked how the debate affected likely voters\u2019 feelings about the candidates, Buttigieg got the biggest increase \u2014 4.5 points \u2014 in the share of respondents who are considering supporting him; his net favorability rating went up 2.6 points, more than anyone else\u2019s except Amy Klobuchar\u2019s.\n\nSo far, no one has released a national poll that takes the debate into account; Buttigieg is still lingering around 6 percent in the RealClearPolitics national average, which earns him a distant fourth place.\n\nButtigieg campaigns in Clinton, Iowa.

As of Sunday, his average support was at 13 percent, only 2 points behind Bernie Sanders. Then, on Monday morning, USA Today and Suffolk University released a poll showing a \u201cnew three-way race\u201d in the Hawkeye State, with Joe Biden at 18 percent, Warren at 17 percent, Buttigieg at 13 percent and Sanders trailing at 9 percent. Especially noteworthy was the decline in Biden\u2019s support (down from 24 percent in the same poll during the summer) and the rise in undecided voters (up 8 points since June, to 29 percent) \u2014 both of which suggest that more moderate Iowa Democrats are increasingly uneasy with the former vice president and are casting around for another alternative to Warren and Sanders. Among respondents who watched last week\u2019s debate, four in 10 (the most in the field) told pollsters that Buttigieg did better than they expected \u2014 meaning he could be that candidate.", "description": "Reminder: There are 105 days until the Iowa caucuses and 379 days until the 2020 election.
