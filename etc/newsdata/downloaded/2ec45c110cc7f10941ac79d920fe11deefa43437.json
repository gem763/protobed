We appreciate the qualities and the importance he possess for the national team. As a result, his standing will not change,\" a statement read.\n\n(Image: Visionhaus)\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nArsenal return to action against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup this week and it is unclear if the midfielder will be involved.\n\nDefender Hector Bellerin has called on supporters to get behind his teammate.\n\n\u201cWe are all humans,\u201d said the Spaniard. \u201cWe all have emotions, and sometimes it's not easy dealing with them.\n\n\u201cIt's time to lift each other up, not to push each other away. We only win when we are together.\u201d\n\n(Image: LAURENT GILLIERON/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nXhaka is understood to have left the Emirates soon after his substitution but was visited by three of his team-mates\n\nMeanwhile, Arsenal legend Emmanuel Petit has slammed the midfielder and says he should be stripped of the captaincy.\n\n\"I have never seen something like what happened with Granit Xhaka before. For me, he can't be the Arsenal captain any longer. It's impossible, what he did was unacceptable,\" he told Paddy Power.\n\n\"What he did on the pitch is one thing, I've made it clear that I don't know what he adds to the team.\n\n\"But what Xhaka did as he left the pitch is totally different. You can't do that - it's like betrayal in England.\"", "description": "Xhaka, 27, is also Switzerland captain with his credentials questioned following the outburst during the draw with Crystal Palace", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Visionhaus", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Laurent Gillieron Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748708.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Switzerland-vs-Ireland-Geneva-15-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
