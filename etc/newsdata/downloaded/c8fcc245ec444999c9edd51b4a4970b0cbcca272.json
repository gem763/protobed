The battle to change Clause IV was a months-long campaign that Blair used to send a simple message to the electorate that the party had changed. He told his first party conference as leader in 1994 that it was time to update the constitution to \u201csay what we mean and mean what we say\u201d.\n\nOut went the catechism (below) that committed the party to the \u201ccommon ownership of the means of production\u201d and in came a rather bland bit of do-gooder waffle. This was more than a public relations exercise, however. Blair took to the road to argue for the new clause, and forced the defenders of the old wording to say what they meant by it. It turned out that they meant anything from orthodox Marxism to socially responsible public limited companies.\n\nThis was one of the largest exercises in political education undertaken by a modern party \u2013 at least until the arrival of Momentum and its associated The World Transformed festival.\n\nAnd yet Corbyn shies away from restaging that debate. He opposed the change in 1995, but lacks the courage to argue for his beliefs now. His media operation \u2013 as slick as New Labour in its heyday \u2013 tries to shut down the question whenever it is raised.\n\nFortunately, there are some intellectually rigorous members of the Labour Party who chafe, not at the main part of the clause, from which Corbyn has borrowed \u201cthe many not the few\u201d, but at one of the paragraphs of exposition that follow. The bit they don\u2019t like is part 2A, which commits the party to work for \u201ca dynamic economy, serving the public interest, in which the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition are joined with the forces of partnership and co-operation to produce the wealth the nation needs\u201d.\n\nCorbyn doesn\u2019t agree with \u201cthe rigour of competition\u201d, any more than Blair believed in state ownership, which is what \u201ccommon ownership\u201d was generally thought to mean.\n\nBut Blair had the courage to set out what he believed and fight for it. Corbyn hopes that, if he keeps it vague, the voters will imagine that he is offering something somehow better than the status quo. \u201cStraight talking honest politics\u201d indeed.\n\nThe old Clause IV, 1918-1995\n\nTo secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.\n\nThe new Clause IV, since 1995\n\nThe Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few; where the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe and where we live together freely, in a spirit of solidarity, tolerance and respect.", "description": "There was a blip in the Labour media handling operation today as it was suggested that Jeremy Corbyn might be planning to restore the old Clause IV of the party\u2019s constitution.\u00a0 He has no such intention, we are told.
