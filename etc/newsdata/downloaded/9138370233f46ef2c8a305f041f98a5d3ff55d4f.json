Now diesel\n\ncosts could spike globally, and many businesses are not\n\nprepared.\n\nDiesel prices are expected to surge as United Nations rules\n\naimed at cleaning up international shipping come into effect on\n\nJan. 1, with many ships expected to burn distillates instead of\n\ndirtier fuel oil.\n\nSlowing economic growth and nascent trade wars could blunt a\n\nprice spike, and as the shipping industry adapts to the rules,\n\nvessels will likely consume less diesel. But in the short term\n\ntheir impact could be profound.\n\nEstimates vary widely, but observers warn that prices could\n\nsurge by nearly 20%. Higher costs for operating generators that power the\n\nmachinery, computer servers and mobile phone towers that run\n\nNigeria's economy could impair growth in gross domestic product,\n\nalready limping along at 1.92% at a time inflation is at 11%.\n\nWith the population growing at 2.6% each year, people are\n\ngetting poorer.\n\n\"In an environment like this, where discretionary spending\n\nis very limited, this could have a big impact,\" said Temi\n\nPopoola, West Africa chief executive for investment bank\n\nRenaissance Capital.\n\nA 20% price rise could shave 0.2% off GDP growth, he said.\n\nGENERATORS EVERYWHERE\n\nNigeria and German engineering group Siemens\n\nagreed in July to nearly triple the country's \"reliable\" power\n\nsupply to 11,000 megawatts by 2023. But previous such plans have\n\nfailed.\n\nWhile many Nigerian household and small business generators\n\nare powered by price-capped gasoline, the big generators for\n\nlarger firms, apartment complexes and more substantial homes can\n\nonly run on diesel.\n\n\"Businesses may struggle to survive, or in the best case\n\nscenario, would at least downsize,\" said Tunde Leye, a\n\nLagos-based analyst with SBM Intelligence. Diesel is the second\n\nor third biggest cost for many Nigerian firms, he said.\n\nThe oil industry, the Nigerian economy's biggest driver,\n\nwould not take a big hit as it does not rely on Nigerian\n\nconsumers being willing to absorb extra costs it has to pass on.\n\nAs fuel producers in their own right, its firms can also recoup\n\ncosts more easily.\n\nBut other heavyweight industries would feel pain. Bank\n\nbranches rely on generators, with diesel often accounting for\n\n20-30% of banks' operating expenses, according to Popoola.\n\nTelecommunications companies need them to run their mobile\n\nphone towers across the country. Telecoms giant MTN\n\ntold local media in 2015 that it spends 8 billion naira ($26\n\nmillion) annually on diesel.\n\nEven bakeries need diesel. At Rehoboth Chops &\n\nConfectioneries Ltd, a bakery in the Ogba district of Lagos,\n\ngiant diesel-powered ovens bake hundreds of loaves of bread. The\n\nfactory runs 24 hours a day, six-and-a-half days a week.\n\nThe lights, mixers and fans that clear the heat are powered\n\nby two large diesel generators outside. The ovens run directly\n\non diesel, so they never cut out.\n\nChief operating officer Abayomi Awe said they use cheaper\n\ngrid power when they can but rely on generators for around 20\n\nhours per day. Grid power can be down for days.\n\n\"It becomes difficult for us to expand if the price of\n\ndiesel goes up,\" he said as bakers scrambled to pull finished\n\nloaves from steaming ovens. \"It might result in some companies,\n\nsome bakeries like ours, shutting down.\"\n\nIN CRISIS, AN OPPORTUNITY\n\nMany businesses are already searching for solutions. The\n\nLagos Chamber of Commerce wants electricity prices revised\n\nupwards so the grid can attract investment - a politically risky\n\nmove domestically.\n\nIt has also lobbied the government to remove tariffs and\n\ntaxes on imported solar panels, which stand at 10%.\n\nUnity Bank and the Bank of Agriculture have already signed\n\ndeals with solar firm Daystar Power, while mobile phone tower\n\nfirm IHS Towers is trying to power more sites using solar\n\npanels.\n\nSolar power provider Starsight Power Utility Ltd said it is\n\nworking with 70% of Nigerian banks, but that cheap diesel has\n\nbeen one of the biggest hurdles for the development of solar.\n\n\"I think an increase in the diesel price would be most\n\nwelcome for our business,\" chief executive Tony Carr said.\n\n\"There is no market penetration because diesel is so cheap.\"\n\n($1 = 305.9000 naira)\n\nGenerator Bound https://tmsnrt.rs/305EalK\n\nGlobal Diesel/Gasoil Use by Industry https://tmsnrt.rs/2ZWlrce\n\nTop Diesel/Gasoil Consuming Nations https://tmsnrt.rs/31jsk53\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "RPT-Nigeria's diesel-dependent economy braces for clean-fuel rules", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
