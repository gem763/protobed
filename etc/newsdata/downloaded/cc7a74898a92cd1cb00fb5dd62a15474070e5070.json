That story also contained some criticism of Barr\u2019s involvement:\n\nMr. Barr is closely managing the Durham investigation, even traveling to Italy to seek help from officials there to run down an unfounded conspiracy that is at the heart of conservatives\u2019 attacks on the Russia investigation \u2014 that the Italian government helped set up the Trump campaign adviser who was told in 2016 that the Russians had damaging information that could hurt Clinton\u2019s campaign. But Italy\u2019s intelligence services told Mr. Barr that they played no such role in the events leading to the Russia investigation, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy said in a news conference on Wednesday. Mr. Barr has also contacted government officials in Britain and Australia about their roles in the early stages of the Russia investigation.\n\nA short time after the story was published, Reps. Schiff and Nadler released a joint statement saying the story raised \u201cprofound new concerns\u201d about the DOJ\u2019s independence.\n\nIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage. Joint statement w/ @RepAdamSchiff \u2014 (((Rep. Nadler))) (@RepJerryNadler) October 25, 2019\n\nSen. Mark Warner was also critical of the news and suggested AG Barr needed to explain himself to Congress:\n\nSenate Intel is wrapping up a three-year bipartisan investigation, and we've found nothing remotely justifying this. Mr. Barr's \"investigation\" has already jeopardized key international intelligence partnerships. He needs to come before Congress and explain himself. https://t.co/hl9qM86QrM \u2014 Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) October 25, 2019\n\nToday, Barr gave an interview to Fox News in which he defended the Durham investigation and said it was operating independently:\n\nBarr, speaking Monday to Fox News on the sidelines of a law enforcement event in Chicago, rejected Democrats\u2019 claims he is acting as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. \u201cThat\u2019s completely wrong and there is no basis for it, and I act on behalf of the United States,\u201d Barr said. The attorney general said that while he\u2019s assisting in connecting Durham with countries that could have valuable information, Durham is running the show. \u201cHe is in charge of the investigation, I\u2019m not doing the investigation,\u201d Barr said, while describing Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, as \u201cthorough and fair\u201d and saying he\u2019s making progress.\n\nAs for testifying before Congress about the investigation, Barr went on to say it was too early for that:\n\nBarr said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be appropriate at this stage for me to discuss the Durham investigation.\u201d He said he\u2019d \u201ccertainly inform the public and Congress\u201d when possible. As for the direction of the investigation, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\n\nIf Democrats are so confident this is all a nothing burger, why do they seem so eager to discount this before it\u2019s complete? Let Durham do his job and if he comes up with nothing you can say \u2018I told you so.\u2019 There\u2019s no point in raising doubt about the investigation before we even know what it\u2019s about. Here\u2019s the interview with Barr:", "description": "\"He is in charge of the investigation, I\u2019m not doing the investigation.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AG-Barr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
