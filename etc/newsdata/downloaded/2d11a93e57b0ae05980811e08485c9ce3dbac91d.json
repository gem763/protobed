In India, tea farms have sprouted up along much of the Asian elephant\u2019s habitat, and the farms\u2019 deep drainage ditches, harmful pesticides and electric fences now mark the endangered elephants\u2019 natural migration routes between India and Bhutan.\n\nAlthough elephants do not eat tea leaves, they often pass through the fields during their long migrations, encountering hostile humans along the way. During the last 75 years, the Asian elephant population in India has declined by 50%, and in 2018 an estimated 64 people died as a result of human-elephant conflict.\n\nIn the Indian state of Assam, tea farmer Tenzing Bodosa has found his own way of creating a more symbiotic human-elephant relationship. Bodosa\u2019s three-hectare elephant-friendly tea garden forgoes the dangerous drainage ditches and electric fences used by other growers in the area, allowing migrating elephants to move through the farm without the threat of injury. Workers on Bodosa\u2019s farm let passing elephants roam in peace, reducing the elephant-related injuries and deaths that can occur when humans attempt to chase the animals away. Bodosa\u2019s farm also does not use chemical pesticides or fertilisers that can be poisonous to elephants and the vegetation they eat.\n\nThe most unusual part of Bodosa\u2019s farm, though, is its buffer zone, where the tea fields end and the jungle begins. While most local growers cut down the plants elephants eat that grow around their farms, Bodosa adds to the vegetation, planting bamboo, star fruit and other plants elephants love. Bodosa\u2019s innovation has not gone unnoticed \u2013 he has trained about 30,000 farmers on his tea-farming practices, and his garden has been certified by the Wildlife Friendly Enterprise Network as the world\u2019s only elephant-friendly tea farm.\n\nEvery year, about 100 tourists from all over the world visit Bodosa\u2019s farm, some staying with Bodosa for several months at a time. Guests are invited to volunteer in the gardens, taste the three varieties of organic tea grown there, and of course, meet the farm\u2019s elephant visitors.\n\n(Video by Kalpana Pradhan, text by Emily Cavanagh)\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
