On a particularly busy day, Theriault will see between six and eight people. She\u2019s tried to grow the patient base, she said, but it\u2019s hard. Since the area is so religious, the clinics have to keep a low-profile. There was one nurse at a college in Presque Isle who used to refer students for birth control and primary care, but stopped suddenly a few years ago, Theriault said, when she found out that MFP was performing abortions.", "description": "Why 15 of the 20 abortion clinics here are at high risk of shutting down", "authors": ["Caroline Kitchener", "Caroline Kitchener Is A Staff Writer At The Lily.
