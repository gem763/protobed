'I had her blocked on everything so she reached out to my sister and was like: \"Can you tell Demi to unblock me?\"\n\n'She was in America at the time with her girlfriend Chelcee [Grimes]. I unblocked her because I wanted to know what she had to say and she kindly apologised for everything she had done.\n\n'She knew she was in the wrong with everything she had done to me. She apologised and we wished each other the best. I was really shocked because I didn\u2019t expect her to ever apologise.\n\n'It felt really nice and it made my heart warm a bit more.

I had her blocked on everything so she reached out to my sister and was like: \"Can you tell Demi to unblock me?\" ' (pictured in July 2019)\n\n'Obviously, I\u2019m always going to care about her but I don\u2019t think I could be her friend. I think as soon as I start hanging out with her, I\u2019d probably want to be with her again. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good route to go down.'\n\nDemi hopes to find someone 'genuine' for her next romance and if the relationship becomes serious, she would like to bring them on TOWIE with her.\n\nHowever, the reality star admitted she has to be cautious about who she dates so she can make sure they are not just in it 'for fame'.\n\nShe said: 'I want someone who\u2019s fun and up for a laugh. I would like them to come on TOWIE with me if it\u2019s serious.\n\nDemi added: 'I unblocked her because I wanted to know what she had to say and she kindly apologised for everything she had done' (pictured in July 2019)\n\nDemi said: 'She knew she was in the wrong with everything she had done to me.

I had a bitter frost towards her because of everything she did to me but when she apologised, it made everything better'\n\n'I want someone who\u2019s not just in it for fame but I would like to bring them on TOWIE. It\u2019s going to be a hard one to find someone like that.'\n\nDemi did not mince her words when she learned that Megan had said the Essex native made her question her sexuality and that the pair didn't have any 'sexual chemistry'.\n\nIn a previous interview with MailOnline, she said: 'I am really upset how she is belittling our relationship. For her to say there was no chemistry or spark, I know for full well that she is lying because we had a passionate relationship.\n\n'I don't know why she has said this. She told me that she had feelings for me, that she had never felt for anyone else before - even [Megan's ex] Wes Nelson.\n\nRomance: While Demi is currently single, Megan is dating footballer and singer-songwriter Chelcee Grimes, 27 (pictured in September 2019)\n\n'She said she only looked for me in a room, so for her to say the relationship was nothing and she wasn't attracted to me is a load of s**t, to be honest.\n\n'I'm not sure if she is trying to impress the new girl that she is with by belittling what we had. She is not being honest, so she has forced me to speak out and tell the truth.'\n\nDemi has been a castmember on TOWIE for a year now and admitted her life has changed since she joined the show.\n\nFuture: Demi hopes to find someone 'genuine' for her next romance and if the relationship becomes serious, she would like to bring them on TOWIE with her\n\nShe credited her older sister Chloe, 37, who has been on TOWIE since 2011, for being a support to her as she adjusted to being on the programme.\n\n'I\u2019ve got my big sister with me and she\u2019s always going to have my back,' she said.\n\n'I\u2019ve been chill because I know I have her with me. If I was starting it by myself, I would have been way more nervous.\n\n'[My life] has changed but I suppose I was used to it before because I grew up with Chloe on it. I\u2019m used to seeing it go on around me. But it has changed, I\u2019m enjoying it. It\u2019s a different lifestyle.'", "description": "Speaking exclusively to MailOnline at the Elbrook Cash and Carry Charity Gala Dinner at CHAK 89 in Surrey on Thursday, Demi told how Megan reached out to her on social media to make amends.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/13/19882634-0-image-a-127_1571400496555.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
