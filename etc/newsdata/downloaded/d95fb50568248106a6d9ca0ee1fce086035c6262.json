Well, perhaps, Hunter Biden allows during his no-holds-barred interview with ABC News. \u201cHowever, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is \u2014 it\u2019s a swamp, in many ways? Yeah,\u201d Biden says, while also admitting that he isn\u2019t sure whether he got appointed to the Burisma board because of his father, who was at the time the Vice President of the United States.\n\nFor the most part, though, Biden fils accuses Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump of peddling conspiracy theories about him and his father Joe Biden:\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don\u2019t believe now, when I look back on it \u2014 I know that there was \u2014 did nothing wrong at all,\u201d said Biden. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is\u2026a swamp in\u2014in\u2014in many ways? Yeah.\u201d \u201cI gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That\u2019s where I made the mistake,\u201d Hunter Biden told ABC News in an exclusive interview. \u201cSo I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\u201d\n\nGive Amy Robach credit for asking a few tough questions in this interview, especially when it comes to his qualifications to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy corporation. Even after all of the months of focus on his work with Burisma, Hunter has not come up with a convincing reason for his hire other than his last name. When Robach asks about his qualifications for the job, she pointedly notes what\u2019s missing:\n\nBIDEN: \u2026 No one buys this idea that I was unqualified to be on the board. ROBACH: What were your qualifications to be on the board of Burisma? BIDEN: Well, I was vice chairman of the board of Amtrak for five years. I was the chairman of the board of the U.N. World Food Program. I was a lawyer for Boies Schiller Flexner, one of the most prestigious law firms in \u2014 in the world. I think that I had as much knowledge as anybody else that was on the board \u2014 if not more.\n\nFirst off, let\u2019s muse over how Hunter Biden built that resum\u00e9, regardless of its utility to natural-gas operations in Ukraine. How did Biden ever get on the board of Amtrak, one his father\u2019s pet projects in the Senate for almost forty years? Hmmm. And how did he get to be a lawyer for the law firm whose chair represented Al Gore in the 2000 election fight? Hmmm.\n\nFor some reason, that didn\u2019t impress Robach:\n\nROBACH: You didn\u2019t have any extensive knowledge about natural gas or Ukraine itself, though? BIDEN: Uh, no, but I think that I had as much knowledge as anybody else that was on the board.\n\nAnd in the end, even Hunter admits that his last name probably was the only entry on the resum\u00e9 that mattered:\n\nROBACH: If your last name wasn\u2019t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? BIDEN: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Probably not. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of things in my life that [would have happened] if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\n\nPrecisely. So let\u2019s connect the dots that Biden spends the rest of the interview denying they exist. If a corrupt foreign oligarch hires you because your last name is the same as the Vice President who\u2019s taking a personal interest in that country, what purpose are you serving? More importantly, whose purpose are you serving, and what does that say about the actions of the Vice President in relation to those purposes?\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the issue in Ukraine. Robach avoids connecting dots about China, where Hunter flew with his father to make business connections with state-backed companies. She focuses on Trump\u2019s ludicrous claim that Biden got $1.5 billion off that trip, but Hunter was conducting his personal business in China while flying with his father the VP. What message did Hunter think that sent to Beijing? For that matter, what message does Joe think it sent?\n\nSpeaking of messaging, expect plenty of narrative-building off this interview in other media outlets that declare the Bidens\u2019 ethics issues resolved. That was Hunter\u2019s mission, and his father\u2019s campaign will certainly push that message today and in days to come. However, it\u2019s pretty clear that neither Biden really has an answer for Hunter\u2019s sudden good fortune in Ukraine and China while his father ran official US policy in both countries, other than orange man bad. Will that be enough for the US media? Almost assuredly yes.", "description": "\"No one buys this idea that I was unqualified to be on the board.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Taylor Millard", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/abc-hunter-biden.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
