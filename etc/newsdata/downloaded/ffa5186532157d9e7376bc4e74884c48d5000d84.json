They didn\u2019t, they only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?\"\n\nContext: Trump was referring to a suicide car bombing in Kabul that killed an American soldier, a Romanian service member and 10 civilians on Thursday. The bombing was the second attack by the group that week.\n\nZalmay Khalilzad, Trump's special envoy for Afghanistan, said Monday that the U.S. and the Taliban had struck an \"in principle\" agreement that would see 5,400 troops leave Afghanistan, in the first sign of a breakthrough in peace talks between the 2 sides.\n\nTrump has faced significant skepticism from people including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and several lawmakers about whether the peace deal being negotiated was strong enough for the U.S. to sign.\n\nWhat they're saying: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Trump had made a \"great decision\" to cancel the meeting as \"we\u2019re dealing with a terrorist group who are responsible for destroying statues of other religions, denying young girls a chance to go to school, brutalizing women and inviting al-Qaeda to reside in Afghanistan as the Taliban\u2019s honored guest.\"\n\n\"We should hit them back hard militarily,\" he said.\n\n\"I will never support a deal where the U.S. gives in to the Taliban\u2019s demands for the U.S. to completely withdraw from Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda and ISIS represent a threat to our homeland and I do not trust the Taliban to deal with these threats.\"\n\n\u2014 Sen. Lindsey Graham statement to Axios\n\nThe big picture: Graham told Axios' Jonathan Swan in August that he\u2019d told Trump it would be a huge mistake, substantively and politically, to withdraw all U.S. military members from Afghanistan by the 2020 election.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.\n\nGo deeper: Afghanistan peace talks: U.S. pushes toward \"face-saving way out\"", "description": "\"How many more decades are they willing to fight?\" he tweeted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/OkwiLipMyF7UcKj2208Z99GZRuk=/0x0:6000x3375/1920x1080/2019/09/08/1567903878339.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
