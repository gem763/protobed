(Justin Mowat/CBC)\n\nFour teens were arrested in connection with the case and two of them have been charged with first-degree murder.\n\nThe two other teens were released without charges after being questioned by police.\n\nEven though it isn\u2019t clear what role bullying played in Devan\u2019s death, police say that part of their investigation is \u201cgrowing.\u201d\n\nAn anti-bullying message was also at the heart of a vigil for Devan that took place on the front lawn of his school on Oct. 9.\n\nAnti-bullying was a big part of the conversation at a vigil and memorial football game in Devan's honour this week. (Justin Mowat/CBC)\n\nDevan\u2019s mom, Shari-Ann Selvey, said her son was bullied for the first time on the second day of school and it continued from there.\n\n\"For a month, we've been trying to get this dealt with,\" said Selvey.\n\nThe Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board (HWDSB) confirmed that school administrators had received reports that Devan was being bullied.\n\nManny Figueiredo, the board\u2019s education director, said he\u2019s waiting for police to finish their investigation before he draws any conclusions.\n\nBut he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe the school failed him.\u201d\n\nSocial workers and police officers were on site at the school this week to help students cope with the news.\n\nAt the candlelight vigil for Devan, supporters wore T-shirts with the words: \u201cStand up. Speak Out. Stop bullying for good.\u201d (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)\n\nWhat should you do if you\u2019re being bullied?\n\nThe first step is to speak out about it, said Tracy Vaillancourt, a professor at the University of Ottawa who studies bullying.\n\nKids often think that telling an adult will only make things worse, she said, but the research shows that\u2019s not true.\n\n\"The problem is that kids don't trust us,\" Vaillancourt said. \"They think we're going to screw it up and they'll always find an example \u2026 of when it did get screwed up.\"\n\nIn fact, she said, most research suggests that if the bullying is immediately reported and some action is taken, the torment usually stops right away.\n\nPeople have left animals, flowers and candles in front of Devan\u2019s home. His funeral is scheduled to take place on Oct. 12. (Dan Taekema/CBC)\n\nExperts say it\u2019s also important to step in when you see someone being bullied, as long as it\u2019s safe to do so.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that Kids Help Phone is always an option. You can live chat, text or call the counselling service any time.\n\nWith files from Dan Taekema and Justin Mowat", "description": "Anti-bullying messages abound as Hamilton police investigate what role bullying played in the death of 14-year-old Devan Bracci-Selvey.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/HamiltonThumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
