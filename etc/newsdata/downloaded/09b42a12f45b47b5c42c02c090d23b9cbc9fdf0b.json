The Trust is generally regarded as a defensive stock by investors, with the potential for capital growth seen as a cherry on top.\"\n\nSince 2014, the trust has delivered annual total returns of over 14 per cent.\n\nThe Warragul centre includes nine tenancies and is 85 per cent pre-leased, including leases to Bunnings and Kmart.\n\nThe site settled in July and construction has commenced, with completion expected in June next year.\n\nMr Langford said the retail centre was located in an area of strong population growth, and only 40 minutes by car from Melbourne's eastern suburbs.\n\n\"[Nearby Pakenham] is going like blazers. It has the highest population growth in the state at 3.5 per cent per year,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig line-up\n\nNewmark's latest acquisition is part of a big line-up of projects, including a planned redevelopment of The Jam Factory on Chapel Street.\n\nThe property fund manager, which Mr Langford runs with Simon Morris, manages a portfolio of almost $1 billion assets.\n\nIts other assets include The Como Centre, Brandon Park Shopping Centre, Tooronga Village Shopping Centre and Chadstone Homeplus Homemaker Centre.\n\n\"The acquisition of Warragul is consistent with our approach to acquire well-located properties in strong local economies. The Hardware Trust focuses on Bunnings as the major occupier on long-term leases,\" Mr Langford said.\n\nThe Trust is paying a distribution yield of 6% with the potential for capital gains. The Trust presently has a WALE of 8.5 years and is 100 per cent occupied.", "description": "A 6 per cent yield is anticipated on the completed development, which Newmark purchased with development agreements in place with construction firm Troon Group.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2136%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ae745baf01f93693535ada344a2716582b58c22f", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
