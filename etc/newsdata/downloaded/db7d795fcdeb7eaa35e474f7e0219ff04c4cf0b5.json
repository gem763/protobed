I don\u2019t mean that they are eager to please, or accessible in the sense of being easy and unchallenging. Their meanings, in fact, can be quite elusive, and they are, as well, reliably strange, displaying a kind of gentle, domestic, frequently humorous surrealism. But his poems manifest, or perhaps presuppose, the intimacy of friendship, written in the voice of someone you know and trust who has let his guard down in an attempt to unburden himself or describe his experience. He might ramble a bit at times, or say things that don\u2019t quite add up, in his attempts to offer a precise articulation of just what it is he\u2019s feeling. (Because Zapruder writes in very short lines and uses very little punctuation, it\u2019s often fascinatingly unclear just how to parse his thoughts, or where his sentences begin and end.) But because his sincerity is apparent, you don\u2019t really mind. That\u2019s how it is with friends, after all.\n\nZapruder\u2019s new book, \u201cFather\u2019s Day,\u201d is firmly situated in its (and our) political moment, and is anchored by a compelling gravity and urgency. His past poems sometimes hid themselves behind a shield of protective irony, using a deflective wit to reassure readers that there was nothing serious at stake. But the new book makes clear that there is a great deal at stake, if not in the poems themselves (Zapruder is reliably and admirably clear-headed about the unlikelihood that any given poem will alter our situation or fix our problems) then in the world with which they engage. \u201cFather\u2019s Day\u201d is not entirely devoid of irony, but the irony that appears here is directed mostly toward the poet himself, who presents himself as a genial, highly self-aware figure largely bemused by the quirks of his own consciousness, a figure for whom the deep weirdness of the world \u2014 its stubborn refusal to make sense \u2014 is sometimes a sort of amusement but at least as often, now, a source of threat and anxiety.\n\n[Stop dissecting a poem as if it were a dead frog]\n\nWhy this shift? The book\u2019s title hints at a partial explanation: Zapruder has become a father . One doesn\u2019t have to be a parent to be distressed and dismayed about the current state of things. But it does, perhaps, render one\u2019s fears more poignant, and makes it all the more difficult to protect oneself through ironic detachment. (As he writes in the book\u2019s title poem, \u201cwe must not think / this is some dream.\u201d ) It\u2019s not surprising, then, to find a kind of bewildered dread making repeated appearances in these poems:\n\nothers booed\n\nthe mayor which was\n\nmy friend said\n\nunderstandable,\n\nI don\u2019t know\n\nwhat is anymore,\n\neveryone understands\n\nin a different\n\ncontradictory way\n\nthe so far purely\n\nabstract\n\ncatastrophe\n\nso many millions\n\nof choices\n\nbrought us\n\nThere is anger here as well, and the poems, despite their general affability, do not always refrain from naming names; the subjects of the poems \u201cPaul Ryan\u201d and \u201cRoseanne Barr\u201d will not, we can assume, be flattered. (Barr\u2019s poem begins, straightforwardly enough, \u201cIs there anyone worse / than Roseanne Barr?\u201d ) But Zapruder\u2019s sense of humor, and his refusal to exempt himself from the possibility of responsibility, not only prevent him from being very angry for very long, they also enable his poems to avoid the perils of didacticism and hectoring self-righteousness that mar so many attempts at political poetry. A poem titled \u201cToday\u201d begins:\n\nJustice Kennedy retired\n\nfarewell pious blowhard\n\nfrom the dark collective\n\ngrief of half of us I stole\n\none long hour to think\n\ndespair is a privilege\n\nwe can\u2019t afford but really\n\na few of us totally can\n\nThe reference to despair is understandable in light of current events. But the book\u2019s afterword reveals an additional dimension, one hinted at but not made entirely explicit in the poems themselves. There we learn that Zapruder\u2019s son was diagnosed on the autism spectrum \u2014 about a month after the November 2016 election. Zapruder\u2019s initial reaction, he admits, was tinged with a dismay and fear he found hard to separate from the election and its aftermath. Looking back, he can see that this reaction said more about himself, and his personal anxieties and limitations, than it said about his son. \u201cIt turned out that I knew virtually nothing about autism,\u201d he confesses in the book\u2019s afterword, \u201cand what I did know was wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe author Matthew Zapruder (B.A.Van Sise)\n\nZapruder handles this juxtaposition of a traumatic private event and a traumatic shared public one with considerable grace and delicacy, effectively exploiting the coincidence of these events without ever being exploitative. His son\u2019s autism lies in the book\u2019s background, while the poems themselves adhere to the details and textures of daily life, and are far less interested in conventional illness narratives \u2014 or, for that matter, cliched and simplistic political ones \u2014 than in the complex, volatile, and constantly altering kaleidoscope of experience that is contemporary life. It\u2019s a complexity that is relieved, from time to time, by brief interludes of peace, stillness, and beauty:\n\nall the multicolored\n\nsigns said\n\nwith love\n\nwe will resist,\n\nover my head\n\nI lifted my son\n\nso he could see\n\nwhat people\n\nlook like\n\nwhen they hear\n\nthe song Imagine\n\nMany poets today strive for an appearance of unflappable coolness, and I greatly admire Zapruder\u2019s willingness to skirt the boundaries of sentimentality in passages like this. Reading \u201cFather\u2019s Day\u201d not only made me feel less alone, it also reminded me how great, in times of confusion, frustration, and shared anxiety, is our human need for tenderness, for forthright yet gentle speech, and for unashamed sweetness.\n\nTroy Jollimore\u2019s most recent book of poems is \u201cSyllabus of Errors.\u201d", "description": "Zapruder throws zingers at Roseanne Barr and Paul Ryan in a collection that\u2019s both biting and tender.", "authors": ["Troy Jollimore"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7OMoixT2o52aC1uXGcubC2DIk5o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BIVCLMGEFUI6TGMGD6Z6IOL34Q.jpg"}
