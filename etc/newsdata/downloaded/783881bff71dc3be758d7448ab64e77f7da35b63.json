The resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, was one of the few remaining amid fears of a Turkish attack on the town. Syria\u2019s state-run media confirmed its troops entered the town.\n\nSyria\u2019s presence in Kobani puts a firm limit on Turkish ambitions in its offensive. The town lies between a Turkish-controlled enclave farther west and smaller areas to the east that Turkey seized in the past week.\n\nTurkey had talked of creating a 30-kilometer (19-mile) deep \u201csafe zone,\u201d driving out Kurdish fighters from the border region. Turkish forces had shelled Kobani in recent days as part of the offensive but had not advanced ground troops on it.\n\nThe battle for Kobani turned the once-nondescript town into a centerpiece of the international campaign against IS, with TV cameras flocking to the Turkish side of the border to track the plumes of smoke rising from explosions in the besieged town. Then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declared it would be \u201cmorally very difficult\u201d not to help Kobani.\n\nThe IS extremists were finally driven out in early 2015 in their first major defeat, and an alliance was cemented that would eventually bring down the group\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria.\n\nNow the Kurdish authority agreed to allow Damascus to deploy its military in the town and other parts of northeast Syria to protect them from Turkey\u2019s offensive launched after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled back American troops working with the Kurds.\n\nAfter being effectively abandoned by the U.S., the Kurds\u2019 turn to the Syrian government for protection has allowed Damascus\u2019 ally, Russia, to step in as the biggest power player.\n\nMoscow further asserted that role Wednesday, offering to mediate a resolution to the conflict, one day before U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was to begin a mission to press Turkey for a cease-fire. On Monday, Trump imposed limited economic sanctions on Turkey to raise the pressure on Ankara.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan defied the sanctions, saying the only way its military offensive would end was if Syrian Kurdish fighters leave a designated border area.\n\nErdogan also said he had \u201cno problem\u201d accepting an invitation from Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit Russia soon to discuss Syria. But he threw into doubt a planned Nov. 13 meeting with Trump, citing anger over the sanctions that Washington imposed Monday on the NATO ally.\n\nDespite an outcry among both Democratic and Republican lawmakers over the pullout and the Turkish invasion, Trump insisted a fight between Turkey and the Kurds was not a U.S. problem and that things are \u201cvery nicely under control\u201d in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cSyria\u2019s friendly with the Kurds. The Kurds are very well-protected. Plus, they know how to fight. And, by the way, they\u2019re no angels,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House while meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nTrump added that U.S. troops are \u201clargely out\u201d of the region, adding that if Russia wanted to get involved with Syria, \u201cthat\u2019s really up to them. It\u2019s not our border. We shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it.\u201d\n\nStill, the repercussions from America\u2019s abrupt withdrawal were expanding. Assad\u2019s forces are returning to regions of northern Syria they abandoned at the height of the 8-year-old civil war. Moscow has taken a more prominent role as an interlocutor among Assad, the former U.S.-allied Kurds and Turkey.\n\nErdogan\u2019s office confirmed the Turkish leader would meet Thursday with Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nErdogan said he was not concerned by the sanctions. He told reporters that chances for his November trip to Washington are \u201csomething to be assessed\u201d after the talks with the American delegation, he said, adding that the sanctions and criticisms in the U.S. constituted \u201cgreat disrespect toward the Turkish Republic.\u201d\n\nIn an address to his ruling party legislators, Erdogan said Turkey would not be coerced into halting its offensive or accepting offers for mediation with the Kurdish fighters, which Turkey considers to be terrorists.\n\n\u201cOur proposal is for the terrorists to lay down their arms, leave their equipment, destroy the traps they have created, and leave the safe zone we designated, as of tonight,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cIf this is done, our Operation Peace Spring will end by itself.\u201d\n\nIn a speech to Parliament, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey won\u2019t be affected by \u201csanctions and threats.\u201d He also said Turkey would \u201cgive the appropriate answer to these sanctions.\u201d\n\nTurkish forces and Kurdish fighters also battled over the border town of Ras al-Ayn. Turkey said it had captured the town days ago, but its hold appeared uncertain.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies that Moscow is committed to mediating between Syria and Turkey.\n\nRussia already has announced it had deployed troops outside the flashpoint town of Manbij to keep apart the Syrian military and Turkish-led forces. Syrian forces took control of Manbij as U.S. troops completed their pullout from the town Tuesday.\n\nLavrov also said Moscow will also continue to encourage Syria\u2019s Kurds and government to seek rapprochement following the U.S. withdrawal. The Kurds are hoping to reach a deal with Damascus that preserves at least some degree of the autonomy they seized for themselves during the civil war.\n\nLavrov also blamed the U.S. and the West for undermining the Syrian state, saying this pushed \u201cthe Kurds toward separatism and confrontation with Arab tribes.\u201d\n\nIn another sign of Moscow\u2019s rising profile, France suggested it will also work more closely with Russia in Syria.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian said told French TV channel BFM that France is now looking to Russia, given their \u201ccommon interests\u201d in defeating the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\n___\n\nMroue contributed from Beirut.
