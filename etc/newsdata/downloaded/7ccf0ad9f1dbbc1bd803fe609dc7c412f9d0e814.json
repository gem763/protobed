I\u2019ve employed women in the top capacity for years and we\u2019ve always paid them the equal of men.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done everything the MeToo movement would love to achieve.\u201d\n\nEarlier comments about #MeToo by Allen were cited by Amazon as a cause for their termination of a four-movie contract with the director, to which Allen responded with a $68m lawsuit.\n\nAt the time, Allen was reacting to a renewed allegation of molestation by his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, which dates back to 1992, when she was seven years old. The allegation, which came during a custody battle during Allen\u2019s split from Mia Farrow, was consistently denied by Allen. Two investigations were launched at the time and no charges brought.\n\nIn 2018 Allen told an Argentinian news show: \u201cThis is something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue,\u201d said Allen. \u201cAnd that was the end, and I\u2019ve gone on with my life. For it to come back now, it\u2019s a terrible thing to accuse a person of. I\u2019m a man with a family and my own children.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants justice to be done. If there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them. You want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Farrow responded to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s defence of Woody Allen earlier this week by saying that Johansson \u201chas a long way to go in understanding the issue she claims to champion\u201d.\n\nFarrow was commenting on an interview in Harper\u2019s Bazaar in which Johansson said that the director \u201cmaintains his innocence\u201d of allegations of sexual abuse against him by Farrow, and that she \u201cbelieve[s] him\u201d.\n\nShe wrote on Twitter: \u201cBecause if we\u2019ve learned anything from the past two years it\u2019s that you definitely should believe male predators who \u2018maintain their innocence\u2019 without question. Scarlett has a long way to go in understanding the issue she claims to champion.\u201d\n\nDylan Farrow (@RealDylanFarrow) Because if we\u2019ve learned anything from the past two years it\u2019s that you definitely should believe male predators who \u201cmaintain their innocence\u201d without question. Scarlett has a long way to go in understanding the issue she claims to champion. https://t.co/S1NmttL9tJ\n\nFarrow\u2019s 2017 op-ed in the LA Times, at the start of the #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment, triggered a wave of controversy in the film industry, with a number of actors (including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Greta Gerwig and Rebecca Hall) publicly stating they would not work with Allen again. The director was defended by other actors, including Javier Bardem and Anjelica Huston.\n\nSpeaking on Friday in France, Allen declared that the current lack of a US distributor for A Rainy Day in New York did not concern him, nor did a future in which he no longer made movies for a mainstream studio.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me for a second,\u201d he said. \u201cIf tomorrow nobody would finance my films and my plays or publish my books, I\u2019d still get up and write because that\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\nAllen has just finished filming his latest movie, Rifkin\u2019s Festival, in San Sebastian in Spain.", "description": "Director defends earlier support for the movement as adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow criticises Scarlett Johansson for backing Allen", "authors": ["Catherine Shoard", "Andrew Pulver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df27d9d98e6745836fc39e3c9d801aa8cf713b59/0_220_4724_2836/master/4724.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=875999e94c1892f447cff45c9cbf17ff", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
