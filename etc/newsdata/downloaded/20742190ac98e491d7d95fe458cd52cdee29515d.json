Photo: Keith Major\n\nTo most people, coming up with a truly original idea takes a lot of work, a lot of caffeine, or a standing reservation at a hotel in your town (a tip from Maya Angelou). But for Iris Apfel, the 98-year-old fashion icon, original ideas come naturally.\n\n\u201cWhen people want something different, they call me. I don\u2019t know why everyone wants to be the same. It\u2019s so boring,\u201d Apfel told me. Her latest project \u2014 because she\u2019s constantly working on creative endeavors \u2014 is designing statement porcelain jewelry for the French house Bernardaud. Yes, statement jewelry made of porcelain \u2014 a truly novel concept.\n\nIt came to her after she met Michel Bernardaud and visited his store in France where she saw their \u201citsy bitsy, discreet\u201d porcelain jewelry. \u201cNot my style at all,\u201d she said. But nobody had made Apfel\u2019s preferred style of jewelry (in a word, large) out of porcelain, so why not her and Bernardaud?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to make porcelain pieces. I can\u2019t tell you why, but it\u2019s not easy,\u201d Apfel said. \u201cAnd people are not very original. Everyone does what everyone else does.\u201d The resulting collection is called Be Bold Over, and took two years to develop. It includes a giant stick-figure-like black necklace \u2014 which Apfel calls her Adam \u2014 colorful, chunky necklaces, and owl brooches in three different colors. Was Apfel inspired by anything in particular? Cubism, maybe, or Grecian pottery? \u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to that. People make up those things after,\u201d she said. The whole collection is available, starting at $255, at Bernardaud.", "description": "Her latest project, because what\u2019s a nonagenarian without a ton of business projects, is designing statement porcelain jewelry for the French house Bernardaud.
