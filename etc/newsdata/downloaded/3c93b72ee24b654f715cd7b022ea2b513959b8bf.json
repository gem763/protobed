She has been separated from her young daughter Gabriella.\n\nBut recent events have complicated matters.\n\nLast month it was revealed that there are now three Australian citizens being held in Iran. They are a young couple who are popular travel bloggers and a university lecturer who was transparently conducting research in Iran. Two of them are also UK nationals. All three were in Iran on valid visas.\n\nTwo American families recently told me they thought their imprisoned relatives could be released in exchange for Ghodskani.\n\nIn August, Ghodskani unexpectedly accepted an extradition request to the United States to face trial. This stirred hope among the Westerners who have been lobbying their governments to win the safe return of their imprisoned family members.\n\nThen, on September 25 - at the height of the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York - Ghodskani was sentenced by a US District Court in Minneapolis to time served. By the weekend, she was back in Iran.\n\nEvery one of the people who could realistically have been part of a potential swap is still sitting in prison in Tehran. The families are left wondering what, if any, bearing the release will have on efforts to free their loved ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's possible that it could be the beginning of a trend of releases on all sides. Such staggered releases are not unheard of. It's also possible that the United States released Ghodskani as a reciprocal gesture of goodwill for the Iranians' release in June of US green-card holder Nizar Zakka.\n\nBut there could be a more ominous explanation: that the Justice Department and State Department were acting out of step. If this proves to be true, it could suggest that the Ghodskani case was simply a one-off, with no broader implications for the future of the hostages.\n\nThat seems unlikely, given the intensity with which the current Iran team at the State Department is monitoring every aspect of the two countries' relationship.\n\nThe fact remains, though, that an Iranian national has been granted her freedom and allowed to return home while at least eight individuals from the United States and Australia - as well as one from the United Kingdom - have yet to receive the most basic rights of representation, unimpeded consular access, due process and a fair trial that Ghodskani was afforded. (And yes, I know that the process wasn't entirely politics-free - but the basic principle still stands.)\n\nWe shouldn't expect justice from Iran's legal system, nor should we deny anyone his or her rights under our system. And we must uphold our commitment to the rule of law regardless of external considerations.\n\nThat said, it will be a serious miscarriage of the very notion of justice if it turns out that an Iranian citizen, convicted of an actual crime, was set free and allowed to go home without the United States and our allies succeeding in winning the freedom of any of its innocent citizens locked up in Iran.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Hope for a swap of political prisoners held in Iran - including eight Americans and Australians and at least one Brit - have faded.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.7894%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1263%2C$y_741/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fdbf0b8e6d5e388aea63a8eeac0a6021674ec027", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
