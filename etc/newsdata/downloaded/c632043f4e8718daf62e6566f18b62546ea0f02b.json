The decline dragged an overall measure of sentiment down more than economists had forecast, to its weakest reading since early 2015.\n\nThe euro, which has fallen almost 4% in the past three months, was little changed at $1.0925 as of 11:12 a.m. Frankfurt time.\n\nManufacturing across the euro area, and particularly in Germany, has been hammered by a cocktail of uncertainty stemming from trade tensions between China and the U.S., and negotiations over the pending exit of the U.K. from the European Union.\n\nThe European Commission, which publishes the monthly sentiment report, said industry managers were \u201cmarkedly more pessimistic\u201d on all fronts, including production expectations, the current level of overall order books and the stocks of finished products.\n\nServices, which has so far proved more resilient, showed a slight improvement in confidence in September. Still, that figure remains near its lowest level since mid-2015. Consumers were also less gloomy.\n\nRecent weeks have been marked by even greater uncertainty radiating from the U.K. over Brexit. Spain\u2019s acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in an interview this week with Bloomberg News that a no-deal scenario was the biggest threat to Spanish economic growth.\n\nCentral banks have responded with interest-rate cuts and other measures, while international organizations have repeatedly warned that protectionism is damaging global growth. The OECD cut its euro-area outlook this week and said it sees the world economy growing just 2.9% this year.\n\n\u201cIt is not in the baseline to have a recession,\u201d incoming European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told Bloomberg Television, when asked about the euro zone. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s mediocre growth, it\u2019s at risk because of essentially one major threat, which is the trade war that we see developing or brewing and the uncertainty it generates for investors.\u201d", "description": "European Economy Stumbles as Confidence Drops to Four-Year Low", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic7be2c6b2af0da0943ac97b3abea8be60.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
