Mark Milley, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Virginia. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to standout moments from another newsy day in the drama engulfing the Trump presidency:\n\n6:08 a.m. Seven days into the impeachment morass, former government officials have begun to speak up without hewing to partisan talking points. On Sunday, the new face was President Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert, who went on ABC News to say he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by Trump\u2019s call to Ukraine. He also said it was \u201cfar from proven\u201d that Trump withheld foreign aid as part of an effort to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden. Today the new voice is former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, who tries to drop some historical context on NPR listeners. \u201cThis is highly abnormal,\u201d Herbst says of Trump\u2019s July call with Ukraine.\n\n6:12 a.m. Herbst also contradicts the Trump argument that Biden did something wrong by pushing to fire Viktor Shokin, a Ukrainian prosecutor who once investigated a company that employed Biden's son. Herbst says Shokin was an untrustworthy \u201ccorrupt prosecutor,\u201d who the United States, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development all wanted out of the job. Herbst also notes that the Shokin affidavit saying Biden\u2019s concerns over his son\u2019s company caused his firing was written to aid attorneys for Dmytro Firtash, an oligarch U.S. officials are seeking to extradite on a warrant of bribery. \u201cThe folks who are pushing this conspiracy theory are citing this as proof,\u201d Shokin says of the affidavit. \u201cAnd in fact it undermines their position.\u201d\n\n8:32 a.m. Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, is asked a question that will not go away anytime soon. Does the former vice president have any regrets about not keeping son Hunter Biden from working for the Ukrainian firm while Biden oversaw Ukrainian policy at the White House? \u201cNo, because he didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Bedingfield says of the younger Biden on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\n8:46 a.m. Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who quit after undermining his reelection hopes by opposing Trump, calls on other Republican senators \u201cto risk your careers in favor of your principles.\u201d In a Washington Post opinion piece, he describes removing Trump from office through impeachment as a tough call, but argues that opposing Trump\u2019s reelection is a moral necessity. \u201cTrust me when I say that you can go elsewhere for a job,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut you cannot go elsewhere for a soul.\u201d\n\n9:44 a.m. Attorneys for the whistleblower who launched this process share a letter sent Saturday to the Director of National Intelligence. \u201cThe purpose of this letter is to formally notify you of serious concerns we have regarding our client\u2019s personal safety,\u201d it reads. The concerns were created by Trump. \u201cI want to know . . . who\u2019s the person that gave the whistleblower the information, because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d the president said Thursday at an event in New York. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo attends an Oval Office event in February. (Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\n10:36 a.m. The president\u2019s 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton takes a stab at Trump\u2019s Twitter crown with a seven-word tweet devoid of context. \u201cThe president is a corrupt human tornado,\u201d it reads. She premiered the meteorological epithet last week with CBS News.\n\n11:07 a.m. Letters have become as hip as tweets. Republican Sens. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and Ron Johnson (Wis.), release a new missive, dated Friday. The senators ask Attorney General William P. Barr to reveal any Justice Department investigation into alleged efforts by Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign or her allies to get Ukrainians to help dig up dirt on Trump and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. \u201cUkrainian efforts, abetted by a U.S. political party, to interfere in the 2016 election should not be ignored,\u201d the senators write. Ukrainian officials have denied any effort to help Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\n11:18 a.m. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) goes on CNBC to confirm what his office has previously made clear. If the House impeaches Trump, the Senate must hold a trial under Senate rule and precedent. \u201cI would have no choice but to take it up,\u201d McConnell says. This will come as a disappointment to Diamond and Silk, who call themselves \u201cTrump\u2019s Most Loyal Supporters\u201d on Twitter. A few hours ago, they called on the GOP to \u201cenforce the rules to end the games,\u201d by which they meant McConnell should ignore the rules and not take up impeachment.\n\n11:21 a.m. Ukraine\u2019s former top law enforcement official Yuri Lutsenko, who took over after Shokin was fired, recounts yet again the efforts by Trump to pressure him to investigate the Biden family. In an interview in Kiev with the Los Angeles Times, Lutsenko says he told Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani there was no evidence that the former vice president or his son had broken Ukrainian laws. \u201cI told him I could not start an investigation just for the interests of an American official,\u201d he said. This restates comments he made to The Post last week. Earlier this year, Lutsenko told a conservative columnist for The Hill newspaper that he would be happy to share what he knew with Barr.\n\n12:36 p.m. Trump\u2019s Twitter tally today stands at 13 so far. He has denounced the \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d called the whistleblower \u201cFake Whistleblower\u201d and declared \u201cthe Bidens were corrupt!\u201d He also raised the possibility that Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) should be arrested \u201cfor treason\u201d for using words Trump never spoke to dramatize the president\u2019s call to Ukraine. Trump tweets #fakewhistleblower in an effort to get the hashtag trending, but at the moment the top trending tags include #civilwarsignup and #civilwar2, both references to another tweet the president sent Sunday quoting a pastor warning of a \u201ccivil warlike fracture\u201d if Trump is ever removed from office. Most of these tweets are not from Team Trump.\n\n\n\nThe president confers with Attorney General William P. Barr.

Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) has about 25,700 retweets on his reaction to Trump\u2019s civil war tweet, which reads, \u201c@realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.\u201d Trump\u2019s original tweet, by contrast, only has 17,200 retweets.\n\n2:39 p.m. In an Oval Office pool spray, Trump makes television of his morning tweets. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find out about a whistleblower,\u201d Trump says. This may run counter to the whistleblower protections that are codified in law and rule. \u201cIn recognition of the importance of whistleblowing and whistleblowers to the effectiveness and efficiency of government, whistleblowing is protected by Federal laws, policies and regulations,\u201d reads a Web page maintained by the Director of National Intelligence. \u201cThese protections ensure that lawful whistleblowers are protected from reprisal as a result of their Protected Disclosure.\u201d\n\n3:05 p.m. A national poll by Quinnipiac University finds that the share of American voters who support impeaching Trump has grown from 37 percent to 47 percent over one week. Among closely watched independents, the share opposing impeachment fell from 58 percent to 50 percent over the same period, while the share supporting impeachment rose from 34 percent to 42 percent. In a separate question, voters support the impeachment inquiry of Trump by a margin of 52 percent to 45 percent. That number closely tracks with Trump\u2019s overall approval in the poll, with 53 percent disapproving of the way he is handling his job and 41 percent approving.\n\n3:30 p.m. Schiff signs a fundraising text for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cRest assured I won\u2019t back down from holding the president accountable, and neither will my Democratic colleagues,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m reaching out.\u201d The ask is $5.\n\n3:55 p.m. The House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees release a subpoena demanding documents from Giuliani and three of his business associates. The documents concern 23 separate items, including communications about potential meetings with Barr or any of his associates.\n\n4 p.m. CNN releases new national polling that closely tracks the Quinnipiac numbers. Young people are particularly drawn to the effort, with 65 percent younger than 35 saying they want to impeach and remove Trump from office, compared with 43 percent who felt that way in May.\n\n4:07 p.m. The afternoon news dump begins. The Wall Street Journal reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took part in the July phone call between Trump and the new president of Ukraine. The source is a senior State Department official.\n\n4:19 p.m. The New York Times reports that Trump pushed Australia\u2019s prime minister to help gather information that he hopes will discredit the investigation by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. The sources are two American officials with knowledge of the call. Australian officials tipped off the FBI in 2016 to alleged Russian overtures to a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. The Russians were said to have boasted about having dirt on Clinton.\n\n5:11 p.m. The Post reports that Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a Justice Department inquiry that Trump hopes will discredit U.S. intelligence analysis of Russian interference in the 2016 election. This includes overtures to British, Australian and Italian officials. The sources are people familiar with the matter.", "description": "President Trump makes it clear he wants the whistleblower\u2019s name. Polls show voters moving into the impeachment camp.
