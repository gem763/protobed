We have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight, because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party before the election,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump said the Democrats are \u201cvicious and they stick together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst. They don\u2019t have people like that. They stick together,\u201d Trump added.\n\nIn an interview aired with \u201cAxios on HBO,\u201d Romney denounced Trump\u2019s requests to Ukraine and China to investigate Biden, questioned Trump\u2019s character, criticized his decision to \u201cabandon\u201d Kurdish allies and deplored his hush money payment to an adult film star.\n\nRomney was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee but lost to incumbent Barack Obama.\n\nANTI-CORRUPTION PROVISION\n\nTrump also labeled as \u201cphony\u201d an anti-corruption clause in the U.S. Constitution that Democrats have accused him of violating by profiting from his businesses, including a hotel in downtown Washington. The so-called emoluments clause bars a president from receiving any gifts, payment or other things of value from a foreign country.\n\nAn accusation of violating the emoluments clause could figure into the articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks next U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 21, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nDemocrats mocked the president over the issue.\n\n\u201cIt is literally in the Constitution,\u201d Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell said on Twitter.\n\nAsked if it is a foregone conclusion that House Democrats will vote to impeach him, Trump said: \u201cThey want to impeach. And they want to do it as quick as possible.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the inquiry is a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who had been a director of a Ukrainian energy company, as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nAnother round of testimony in the inquiry is set for this week, including by Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, on Tuesday.\n\nActing White House budget director Russell Vought said both he and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, would not provide depositions to the committees leading the inquiry.\n\nDuffey had been scheduled to testify behind closed doors on Wednesday as Democrats investigate whether Trump withheld $391 million in security aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate Biden and its own role in the U.S. election.\n\nA planned deposition on Wednesday by Philip Reeker, the acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs who oversaw U.S. policy toward Ukraine, has been postponed at the request of the lawmakers carrying out the inquiry, a source familiar with the matter said. He is now expected to testify in closed session on Saturday, an official working on the inquiry said.\n\nTrump, a real estate developer, said serving as president has personally cost him $2 billion to $5 billion dollars. He also expressed annoyance at having to reverse his decision to stage the Group of Seven summit in June at his Trump National Doral golf resort in the Miami area.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nHis plan to host the gathering was lambasted by both Democrats and Republicans who said it gave the impression he was profiting from being president.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve made a fortune if I just ran my business. I was doing it really well. I have a great business. I have the best properties,\u201d Trump told reporters.", "description": "Donald Trump on Monday exhorted fellow Republicans to get tougher and fight for his presidency, saying the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives wants to impeach him \"as quick as possible\" over his request that Ukraine investigate a political rival.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443416505&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K1AY", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
