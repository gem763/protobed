Jasmine Stole Weiss and Rick Cruz/PDN, Pacific Daily News\n\nHAGATNA, Guam \u2013 A 15-year-old boy reportedly fell about 100 feet from a cliff into the water off Guam on Tuesday. He suffered serious injuries but was alert and conscious when first responders reached him, according to Guam Fire Department officials.\n\nA crew on a rescue boat pulled the boy from the water, said Kevin Reilly, a Guam fire spokesman and firefighter. The crew took him to the Hagatna marina and then to a waiting ambulance to take him to the hospital.\n\nThe boy had multiple lacerations and injuries to his head and body from the fall from Jonestown Cliff, said Assistant Fire Chief Daren Burrier.\n\nBurrier said rescue units responded quickly to Tamuning on the western side of Guam, which was to the boy\u2019s benefit.\n\nA 15-year-old boy is secured to a gurney by Guam Fire Department personnel in preparation for him to be taken to the hospital Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019, after the boy fell approximately 100 feet from a cliff in Tamuning, Guam.

He had a blue sheet wrapped around most of him, save for his bare feet and bandaged head.\n\nThe boy was stable on the way to the hospital, Burrier said.\n\nBeer name: Marshall Islands says beer named after Bikini Atoll unacceptable\n\nOcean conditions in the Mariana Islands, which Guam is a part of, were particularly threatening Tuesday with a super typhoon in the area. Guam, which is in the western Pacific Ocean, is about 5,802 miles west of San Francisco and nearly 1,600 miles east of Manila, Philippines.\n\nSuper Typhoon Hagibis passed over Anatahan at 1 a.m. local time Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. By 10 a.m., Hagibis was moving away from the Marianas.\n\nBut Hagibis\u2019 influence in the region remained.\n\nBurrier cautioned residents to heed the weather services\u2019 advisories. He said the skies may clear up and the sun might be out in the next few days, but the water will still be rough.\n\nThe weather service had issued a high surf warning and a high surf advisory Tuesday for Guam and Rota. The high surf advisory is in effect until about Friday morning.\n\nA high surf advisory means that dangerous, battering waves will pound the shoreline and make for life-threatening conditions, according to the advisory.\n\nHigh surf will affect all beaches and produce \u201cdangerous swimming conditions,\u201d according to the National Weather Service.\n\nFollow Jasmine Stole Weiss on Twitter: @StoleJasmine\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/08/teen-survives-fall-off-guam-cliff/3906652002/", "description": "The 15-year-old boy had multiple lacerations and injuries to his head and body, but he was alert and conscious when responders reached him.", "authors": ["Jasmine Stole Weiss", "Published A.M.
