Harlem School of the Arts\n\nThroughout the night, guests were treated to spectacular performances by some of the school's gifted young music, voice and dance students.\n\nWhile accepting the Visionary Lineage Award, Nyong'o credited her mother for fueling her passion for art.\n\n\"I was thinking about [the Harlem School of the Arts] and what it does for children and its students\u2026 I didn't have an institution where I'm from in Nairobi, Kenya, and so the only way my interest in the arts thrived was because I had parents who valued those interests,\" she said. \"My mother in particular, she really nurtured my artistic spirit.\"\n\n\"I really didn't do much,\" Dorothy Nyong'o said to the ball's attendees. \"My job was really to facilitate it and I'd like to encourage parents to do it. Sometimes we make the mistake of trying to make our children what we think we want.\"\n\nBefore guests and honorees enjoyed the night's festivities, CBSN Digital Producer Jonathan McDougle spoke to Lupita Nyong'o and her mother Dorothy Nyong'o:\n\nJonathan McDougle: You're being honored with the Visionary Lineage Award. How befitting mother and daughter. What does tonight mean for you?\n\nLupita Nyong'o: For me it's a chance to finally praise my mother, award her for the great work she did in raising me and allowing me to be me. She didn't try to make me different. What I found myself interested in, she encouraged me at every stage of my life. She nurtured my curiosity, and so this is a chance for me to completely declare my love and appreciation for her.\n\nJonathan McDougle: You just released a children's book talking about embracing your skin and it kind of talks about colorism. What I want to ask you is, what do you say to little boys and little girls who may identify with you, who are in the arts and may have some of those insecurities that you had as a child?\n\nLupita Nyong'o: Well, buy my book (laughs), number one. And I think the answer is ultimately in each one of ourselves, to save ourselves from whatever it is that the world might put against you. You have to believe in yourself first, you have to encourage yourself first, you have to love yourself first. And when you're true to yourself, then you can usher yourself out of really difficult situations.\n\nJonathan McDougle: Dorthy, what advice do you have for parents in regards to supporting your children who want to explore the arts?\n\nDorothy Nyong'o: Your children are already made. And your job is to find out who they're supposed to become and just nurture that. Allow them to be who they're supposed to become.", "description": "Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o praised her mother for \"allowing me to be me\"", "authors": ["Jonathan Mcdougle", "Jonathan Mcdougle Is A Cbs News Digital Line Producer.
