Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Kremlin via REUTERS\n\nThe two Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers touched down at Waterkloof air force base in Tshwane on Wednesday, the South African National Defence Force said. Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said the mission is designed to nurture military ties with South Africa.\n\nSpeaking before dozens of African heads of state at a two-day summit in the southern Russian city of Sochi, Putin called for trade with African countries to double over the next four to five years and said Moscow had written off African debts to the tune of over $20 billion.\n\nThe first Russia-Africa summit is part of a Kremlin drive to win business and restore influence that faded after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, which backed leftist governments and movements across the continent throughout the Cold War.\n\n\u201cMany Russian companies have long and successfully worked with partners from the most different sectors of the African economy and plan to expand their influence in Africa. We of course will provide support at the state level,\u201d said Putin.\n\nThe prize is greater political clout on a continent with 54 United Nations member states, vast mineral wealth and potentially lucrative markets for Russian-manufactured weapons.\n\nBut Russia is starting from a low base. Although it has enjoyed considerable success selling arms to African countries, Moscow lags far behind competitors in trade terms.\n\nRussia says its trade with African countries rose to $20 billion last year, but it did not rank among the continent\u2019s top five largest partners for trade in goods, according to Eurostat.\n\nThat list was topped by the European Union, followed by China, India, the United States and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAs it noted the arrival of Russia\u2019s warplanes, the South African National Defence Force praised what it said were strong diplomatic links between the countries.\n\n\u201cOur relations are not solely built on \u2018struggle politics\u2019, but rather on fostering mutually beneficial partnerships based on common interests,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nSouth African media have been more sceptical about Moscow\u2019s return to the continent. \u201cRussia is the clumsy latecomer at Africa\u2019s superpower party,\u201d ran a Mail & Guardian headline in June.\n\nRussia\u2019s reappearance was thrust into the spotlight last year when three Russian journalists were killed in the Central African Republic (CAR) while investigating the alleged presence there of a shady Russian private military contractor known as the Wagner group.\n\nPutin and CAR President Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra discussed the investigation into the killings at talks on Wednesday, the Kremlin said.\n\nU.S. officials have vowed to counter what they see as Moscow\u2019s growing political and economic clout in Africa as well as that of China, which has long had a large economic presence there and began its own series of Africa summits in 2006.\n\nRussia and Niger signed a deal to supply 12 Russian-made Mi-35 attack helicopters to Niger, RIA news agency cited a senior official at Russia\u2019s federal military-technical cooperation service as saying on Wednesday.\n\nRussia\u2019s largest lender Sberbank and its state financial institutions agreed to support trade finance between Russia and African countries with an agreement worth $5 billion. [nL5N27859A]\n\nRussia\u2019s state nuclear company Rosatom is in talks with Ethiopia to build a nuclear power station there, Interfax quoted the Russian company as saying.\n\nOn Monday, Putin accused former colonial powers in the West of intimidating African countries to exploit the continent\u2019s resources. \u201cWe see how an array of Western countries are resorting to pressure, intimidation and blackmail of sovereign African governments,\u201d Putin told TASS news agency.", "description": "Russia landed two nuclear-capable bombers in South Africa on a training mission on Wednesday, a flight apparently timed to coincide with President Vladimir Putin's opening of a flagship Russia-Africa summit designed to increase Russian influence.", "authors": ["Darya Korsunskaya", "Tom Balmforth", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444171359&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1JF-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
