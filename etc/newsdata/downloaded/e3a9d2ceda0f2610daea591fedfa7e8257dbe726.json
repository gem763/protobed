Finebaum then said nobody should feel bad for Newton because Newton has only ever cared about himself.\n\n\"He's a train wreck right now, he can't do what he used to do,\" Finebaum said of Newton. \"And quite frankly, forget the sympathy toward him. Cam Newton has never really cared about anyone other than Cam Newton ... He's brought this franchise down. It's over for Cam Newton. Nice knowing you, but you're done.\"\n\nRead more: There are growing concerns about Cam Newton's health and future after one of the worst games of his career\n\nClark then jumped in to criticize Finebaum, saying moments before that Finebaum had heaped praise on Eli Manning. On Tuesday, the New York Giants announced Manning would be benched for rookie quarterback Daniel Jones in Week 3.\n\n\"We just spoke glowingly about Eli \u2014 not we, Paul \u2014 spoke glowingly about Eli Manning, and he has been a dud for the last four years,\" Clark said. \"You wanna talk about bringing a franchise down, Eli has ruined that franchise.\n\n\"So, we gotta take out how we feel about dudes because he's a Manning because we love him because he gives us this 'Aw shucks,' you can do whatever you want, and I'm gonna be OK about it. That's not true. If we're looking at it, Cam has more left than Eli's had for years.\"\n\nFinebaum stood quietly, rolling his eyes as Clark spoke.\n\n\"We gotta stop treating dudes because they play a certain way, or because they act a certain way that's not familiar to us, that that's not leadership, that that's not caring,\" Clark said.\n\nFinebaum responded that Manning won two Super Bowls and Newton has not. The show then changed topics.\n\nWatch the exchange below:", "description": "Ryan Clark said Paul Finebaum previously showered praise on Eli Manning, who Clark argued has been much worse than Cam Newton the last four years.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d824a782e22af6b961e7024-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
