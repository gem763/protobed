On Tuesday, the union said that it had rejected a GM proposal to resolve the walkout, involving about 50,000 workers.\n\nBut it appears that progress is being made as UAW membership braces for the first $215 weekly strike paychecks to come in from the union.\n\nThe UAW told its members that a new comprehensive offer made by GM late Monday to end a two-week-old strike was not acceptable and said it had made a new counterproposal.\n\nIn a letter to members, UAW vice-president Terry Dittes said, \"This proposal that the Company provided to us on day 15 of the strike did not satisfy your contract demands or needs.\"\n\nHe added: \"There were many areas that came up short like health care, wages, temporary employees, skilled trades and job security to name a few.\"\n\nTemporary workers have been a critical point of negotiations, although on health care, GM previously proposed that it would keep worker contributions low by US standards, at 3%.\n\nA GM spokesperson told Business Insider, \"We continue to negotiate and exchange proposals, and remain committed to reaching an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our company.\"\n\n(Reuters reporting by David Shepardson, editing by Franklin Paul.)", "description": "The United Auto Workers union said a new comprehensive offer made by GM late Monday to end a two-week-old strike was not acceptable.", "authors": ["Matthew Debord"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93c5fa2e22af42f71bc81d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
