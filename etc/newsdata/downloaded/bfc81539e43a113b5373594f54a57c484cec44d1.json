Of this, $3 billion, or 2.8 per cent, was derived from companies with operations in the UK, or companies that export to the UK.\n\nIt is difficult to make the case that all of the profits that Australian companies earn in the UK, or even the majority of this profit, is actually at risk.\n\nThe withdrawal from the EU and the potential for the UK to fall into a recession will likely have the greatest impact on ASX-listed companies providing financial services, construction and travel.\n\nFor a range of ASX-listed companies with operations in the UK, the impact on profits is a little less clear. A recession in the UK will hit sales at Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield\u2019s two malls, though the flagship London mall is fully leased.\n\nAs the premier mall in the country, the boost to incoming tourism from a lower GBP should offset declining domestic retail sales. Similarly, Brexit-based stimulus plans may well benefit Lendlease's urban renewal projects.\n\nIn the case of Australian companies providing healthcare services such as Sonic Healthcare, Ramsay and CSL, the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU might not have a substantial impact.\n\nIn September, the UK Chancellor announced a potential post-Brexit stimulus package involving tax cuts and increases in funding for schools, hospitals and the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile European leaders have talked tough, it will hardly be in Germany\u2019s or Europe\u2019s interests to erect significant trade barriers between Europe and the fifth-largest economy in the world. Indeed, total export volumes to the UK account for nearly 3 per cent of German GDP.\n\nFor all the negativity, we consider that the actual impact on Australian profits and dividends paid to shareholders will be quite minimal.\n\nWhen the UK joined the EEC in 1975, Australia had to find other markets for the agricultural goods that previously had been shipped to the UK under preferential Imperial trade agreements. These goods became subject to EEC tariffs and consequently were replaced in British supermarkets with European foodstuffs.\n\nHugh Dive is the chief investment officer of Atlas Funds Management.", "description": "It is difficult to make the case that all of the profits that Australian companies earn in the UK, or even the majority of this profit, is actually at risk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2024%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_24/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9699f7d58e3279cb21743a08eca58f2d9f9255fb", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
