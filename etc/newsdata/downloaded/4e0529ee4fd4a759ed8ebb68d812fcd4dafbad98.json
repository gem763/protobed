The spectacle is also an ideal opportunity for players to market themselves to overseas clubs.\n\nAn overseas contract is a life-changing experience that many can only dream of.\n\nBut first they need to go to Egypt next month for a chance to book a ticket to Tokyo.\n\nEven then, there will be international scouts ready to pounce on fresh talent. A move to an overseas club would not only benefit our players, but our clubs as well.\n\nSo why make it difficult for the players and the coach?\n\nThe problem is that this tournament does not fall within the Fifa calendar and, as a result, clubs are not obliged to release players.\n\nBut this should not be used against Notoane, who has come a long way and worked hard to be where he is with the team.\n\nWhile CAF is to blame as well for not aligning the continental competition with Fifa dates, that should not be used as an excuse either.\n\nThe onus is on the PSL and Safa to find the middle ground for the benefit of South African football. This is not just about the respective organisations, but about the future of the country\u2019s football.\n\nClubs find themselves in the middle of the spat as they don\u2019t know whether to release players or not.\n\nIf club coaches feel they want their best players for their matches, what makes them think that Notoane does not deserve to have the best players as well?\n\nThere is only one solution to this debacle and that is to postpone or reschedule the matches to be played by the affected clubs so that they can release players.\n\nWith South Africa having been drawn against powerhouses \u2013 Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Zambia \u2013 a makeshift team will not stand a chance of qualifying for Tokyo, hence it is imperative that all the parties concerned meet Notoane halfway.\n\nIf there ever was an opportune time for the PSL and Safa to show a united front, this is it.", "description": "What have we been doing all these years that we are still discussing the issue of national team call-ups?", "authors": ["Timothy Molobi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8639/655d515b6caa474fb3ead06697f156af.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
