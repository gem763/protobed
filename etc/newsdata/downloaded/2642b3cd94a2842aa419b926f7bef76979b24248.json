Bernie Sanders, who is vying for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination in 2020, unveiled his plan to tax the assets of the nation\u2019s wealthiest individuals \u2013 replete with calls for the creation of a \u201cnational wealth registry.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAccording to Sanders, the registry \u2013 in combination with \u201csignificant additional third party reporting requirements\u201d \u2013 would help ensure the country\u2019s rich are not able to evade the tax.\n\nAs opposed to taxes levied on income and payrolls, a wealth tax would target the value of accumulated assets owned by rich Americans \u2013 or their net worth. The problem? It would require the determination of the value of things like art, jewelry, real estate holdings, business ownership stakes, etc., on a continual basis.\n\n\u201cThe premise of this wealth tax would presumably work much like our current estate tax where the decedent\u2019s estate tax is calculated as a percentage of the total value of the estate's assets (cash, investments, real estate and more) minus a variety of deductions, including charitable contributions,\u201d Geoffrey Weinstein, special counsel in the Tax, Trusts & Estates Department of Cole Schotz, told FOX Business. \u201cBut this type of tax would be implemented on a year to year basis.\u201d\n\nWhile the details of Sanders\u2019 registry have not yet been specified, Weinstein said it would likely be generated through cross-reporting of various IRS forms \u2013 like W-2s, 1099s \u2013 and filings with the Securities Exchange Commission (like 10K and 8K reports, as well as proxy statements). Enforcement, he said, would presumably be delegated to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign did not return FOX Business\u2019 request for further details.\n\nChris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute and editor of www.DownsizingGovernment.org, told FOX Business that Sanders would use the registry to track assets of the wealthiest Americans, but the task could be much more difficult than it sounds.\n\n\u201cThere would be huge problems in assigning values to people\u2019s global wealth including such items as private business assets and collectibles which don\u2019t have ready market values,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd the IRS would not find the vast piles of assets that Americans would hide abroad if such a tax were imposed. Huge amounts of wealth would not be 'registered' under Sanders\u2019 plan because of evasion.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 wealth tax would be imposed on married couples with a net worth of $32 million or more \u2013 and individuals with at least $16 million. Rates, beginning at 1 percent, would reach as high as 8 percent for married couples with $10 billion or more worth of assets (individuals with $5 billion).\n\nThe plan aims to cut in half the wealth of billionaires over the course of 15 years.\n\nSanders estimates the tax would raise $4.35 trillion over the course of the decade and the funds would be used toward parts of his other proposals \u2013 including housing, health care and universal childcare.\n\nAn estimated 180,000 households would be subject to the tax set with those parameters.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFellow Democratic 2020 contender Massachusetts Sen.
