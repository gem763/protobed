REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWith Congress returning from a long summer recess, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi again urged the Republican-controlled Senate to promptly approve a bill clamping down on unregulated gun sales through the internet and at gun shows.\n\n\u201cWe are not taking no for an answer,\u201d Pelosi told a news conference in which Schumer said approving the House-passed background check bill should be \u201cour first order of business.\u201d\n\nThe calls for gun legislation grew last month following mass shootings in the Texas cities of El Paso, Odessa and Midland, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the Senate\u2019s autumn work session without mentioning gun legislation.\n\nIn remarks to reporters at the White House, Trump said he was \u201cdealing\u201d with Republicans and Democrats on gun control. \u201cAt the same time, we have to protect our Second Amendment very strongly and we will always do that,\u201d he added, referring to the U.S. Constitution provision guaranteeing a right to bear arms.\n\nAmid the recent mass shootings, McConnell said he would not bring a gun bill to the floor of the Senate unless it had Trump\u2019s support.\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy, a leading gun control advocate, issued a statement on Monday saying that \u201ctime is running short\u201d to strike a deal on a background check bill that could pass Congress. He added: \u201cIt seems more likely that we\u2019re going to find ourselves back in a familiar place where 90 percent of the Americans who want more background checks are going to be disappointed once again.\u201d\n\nDayton Mayor Nan Whaley, who spoke at the Pelosi-Schumer news conference, said she was in Washington demanding \u201ca simple vote on what nine out of 10 Americans agree on. I don\u2019t know of anything else that nine out of 10 Americans agree on except HR 8,\u201d referring to the House\u2019s background check bill.\n\nA bipartisan group of mayors met with high-ranking White House officials earlier on Monday to discuss gun legislation but gave no indication of an agreement between the two sides.\n\nTrump has said he favoured action, possibly on tackling mental health issues related to gun violence or expanded background checks. The White House has yet to outline any specific proposals.\n\nBryan Barnett, mayor of Rochester Hills, Michigan, and the current head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said there was a \u201crobust\u201d discussion about gun legislation at the White House. He said the White House team talked about \u201ca suite of solutions\u201d and that background checks \u201care certainly on the table.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials said last week the measures might include expediting the death penalty for mass shooters.", "description": "Democrats in the U.S. Congress pledged on Monday to intensify pressure for stricter gun-sale background check legislation, citing strong public backing for the measure, but received no sign of support yet from President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428109671&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881XZ", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
