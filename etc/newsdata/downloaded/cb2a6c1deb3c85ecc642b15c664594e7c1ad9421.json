He does all this research on Randall Pearson ahead of meeting Deja\u2019s parents for the first time, yet there are so many things about Randall for which Malik could never be properly prepared. Unless there\u2019s some article out there warning Malik about the longest, most awkward handshake that has ever transpired between a grown man and the 16-year-old interested in dating his daughter. I mean, if there is, that\u2019s some really thorough coverage of the Philadelphia City Council, so good for them. Otherwise, Malik went into the handshake blind, and for that I am sorry.\n\nMalik\u2019s meeting with Randall goes pretty well at first. Randall remains the hottest nerd who ever lived, so of course he\u2019s equal parts intimidating and awkward, but he\u2019s genuinely impressed with Malik\u2019s even coming to meet the Pearsons. It\u2019s all going smoothly, especially considering this is a 16-year-old looking to date a 14-year-old. Then Malik casually drops the fact that he has a daughter into the conversation and you can see Randall\u2019s brain exploding inside his head.\n\nListen, I get it. I\u2019d be alarmed that my 14-year-old was dating at all, let alone dating someone who, as Beth astutely notes, \u201cputs babies in people.\u201d Still, you\u2019d think Randall would give Malik some benefit of the doubt since, as we learn in \u201cFlip a Coin,\u201d Beth\u2019s mom, Carol, misjudged Randall from the moment they met. Actually, just kidding, Randall and Beth are acting appropriately terrified.\n\nBut the other part is true: When Randall and Rebecca cozy up to Beth and Carol\u2019s cafeteria table during Parents Weekend, Carol very much enjoys her conversation with Rebecca, but she very much does not enjoy the thought of her Bethany even considering Randall as a viable romantic partner. Later, she tells teen Beth that Randall and his family are broken (Oh, Carol, you don\u2019t know the half of it) and Beth needs someone who can provide strength at this time, someone who sees her and her needs completely.\n\nIt is the exact wrong thing to say. Teen Beth realizes that Randall, whom she was ready to cut out of her life, does see her. Well, he sees her enough that he gives her a lemon at lunch without her needing to ask, because he remembers from their one date that Beth drinks Coke with lemon. A lot of lemon imagery on this show, you guys. So R&B Productions is a go, yet it still takes Carol up until this very moment to see Randall for who he really is.\n\nIn the present-day time line, Carol has come to Philadelphia for the grand opening of Clarke\u2019s School of Dance, which is a disaster thanks to a dead possum in the walls. The smell is horrific, and Carol thinks they should postpone but Randall wants to fix it (shocking!). Carol watches her son-in-law go to great lengths to make this day happen for Beth, and only then is she willing to admit she was wrong about him. I mean, obviously not about the broken part, because that is dead-on, but about being right for Beth. Then Randall dances by himself while Beth does a demo for the neighborhood, and it is a true gift to us all.\n\nCarol may have walked away from Parents Weekend with doubts about the Pearsons, but Rebecca returns home feeling inspired. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be funny, but, reader, I laughed so hard at Rebecca\u2019s reaction when, after going on and on about the loss of Jack and her family\u2019s barely holding on, Carol casually mentions that her husband also died last year. Rebecca is aghast and mystified as to how Carol can, like, grieve in a way that doesn\u2019t completely put her life and her children\u2019s lives on hold.\n\nThe good news is that hearing about how Carol started living her life again after wondering what her husband would think if he knew she\u2019d stopped doing things she loved after he died has Rebecca wondering the same thing. I mean, Jack would be pissed. And so the Saddest Rebecca in our Pearson Time Line decides it\u2019s time to stop being so sad. They\u2019re going to move out of their temporary apartment and let some light in, literally and figuratively. It\u2019s a new day for the Pearsons!\n\nBut in true Pearson fashion, any joyous occasion must be followed by something at least mildly concerning, so just as Rebecca is determined to get her life back on track, she gets a message from Kevin letting her know that New York is cool, he\u2019s auditioning for a Sunny D commercial, and, oh yeah, he and Sophie just got married. That seems like a really sound decision that we\u2019ll be exploring more this season!\n\nIt\u2019s actually perfect timing to finally delve into Kevin and Sophie\u2019s ill-fated marriage, since, over in the present day, Kevin has vowed to help Cassidy reunite with her estranged husband. I mean, not that it\u2019ll backfire and Kevin and Cassidy will end up falling for each other or anything, but yeah, sure, help her win her husband back.\n\nAgainst all odds, by the end of \u201cFlip a Coin,\u201d Kevin and Cassidy are kind of friends? Along with Uncle Nicky, they end up spending the whole day together and wasting time until a 3 p.m. AA meeting they thought had been scheduled for 10 a.m. Cassidy is sad because her husband just asked her to move forward with the divorce. Kevin is sad because The Manny got canceled and he\u2019s \u201creflecting on his life\u201d or something. (The lengths to which This Is Us goes to get us to care about a show called The Manny is truly breathtaking.) And Nicky is sad because \u2026 well, because he\u2019s Nicky.\n\nThe three spend the day looking at RVs for Kevin to buy for Nicky (\u201cI\u2019m an actor. I\u2019m great at filling up free time\u201d), even though Nicky absolutely does not want one. Cassidy watches all day long as random people come up to Kevin and act as if they know him, and he\u2019s charming and wonderful to each of them regardless of how terrible he feels. She\u2019s definitely not cool with his comparing the sadness he feels for the end of a TV show he isn\u2019t even on anymore with what she\u2019s going through, but she learns to appreciate him. And when he tells her he\u2019s been through his own divorce, she doesn\u2019t immediately laugh at him, which is something. She tells him about how she got engaged and even asks him a little bit about The Manny, so there\u2019s real progress in this relationship. There\u2019s also a ton of chemistry (does Justin Hartley just have great chemistry with everyone or \u2026 ?), which I hope those two dummies realize sooner rather than later. For now, they end the day resolved to fix Cassidy\u2019s marriage, and Kevin buys an RV to park right next to Uncle Nicky. He\u2019s not going anywhere anytime soon is what they\u2019re saying.\n\nThis Is the Rest\n\n\u2022 As Kevin \u201cgrapples\u201d with the \u201closs\u201d of The Manny, we get a flashback to the day they filmed the pilot \u2014 then titled \u201cUntitled Hot Babysitter Pilot,\u201d which is perfect \u2014 and learn that Kevin wasn\u2019t even sure he wanted this pilot to work. Right before they film the final scene, in which Kevin turns his character from dumb and one-note to so lovable that he saves a truly terrible TV show and changes the course of his entire life, he admits to Kate that he doesn\u2019t want the pilot to work out. What a life he would\u2019ve had, huh?\n\n\u2022 As if Uncle Nicky couldn\u2019t get any sadder, in a surprising moment, he opens up to Kevin and Cassidy about why he can\u2019t give up his trailer. Before he went to Vietnam, he was dating a girl named Sally and they\u2019d promised to drive cross-country in a trailer when he got back. Once over there, he stopped writing to her, but upon his return as a broken man with nothing left to lose, he bought the trailer and drove over to Sally\u2019s as a grand gesture. Only she wasn\u2019t home and he took it as a sign, gave up, and left. What a life he would\u2019ve had, huh?\n\n\u2022 Jack asking a girl out for Nicky? Kind of like Kevin helping Randall ask Beth out? I get it, show!\n\n\u2022 Kate and Toby decide to take Baby Jack to a music class (actually, Kate decides, and Toby goes along with it, per usual), and it is a complete disaster. They spend the rest of the episode snapping at each other in the car, so watching this marriage fall apart should be a super-fun time for all of us.\n\n\u2022 In much better Kate news: While mom is off at Parents Weekend, teen Kate has a flirty encounter with the guy who works at the mall record store, and she ends up getting both a job and a new love interest. To think, she was going to just stay inside and watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer all weekend!\n\n\u2022 Did I tear up watching Kate ask her mom to dance to a Carole King album with her? Yes, I did! They have a very complicated relationship, and both are so sad so this was nice.\n\n\u2022 \u201cMy meat is always well done.\u201d", "description": "In which Malik meets Randall, Carol meets Rebecca, and America meets \u2018The Manny.\u2019 A recap of \u2018Flip a Coin,\u2019 episode 4 of season 4 of This Is Us on NBC.", "authors": ["Maggie Fremont"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-this-is-us.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
