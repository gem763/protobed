The Geneva-based organisation had already found that both Airbus and Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies.\n\nThe European Union is expected to win permission to impose its own tariffs when its parallel case catches up in 2020.\n\nThe outgoing EU Trade Commissioner made a statement, saying: \"The mutual imposition of countermeasures, however, would only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.\"\n\nHow significant this harm will be?\n\nAccording to the Italian cheesemaking consortium, US consumers will pay around $5 a kilogramme more for Italian Parmesan because of duties.\n\nUS tariffs will hit around 500 million euros of Italian agricultural products per year, around 1 billion euros of Spanish goods and put at risk over 1 billion euros of whiskey exports from Scotland to the US - the largest and most valuable single market for Scotch whiskey.\n\nBritain is now seeking confirmation from the World Trade Organisation that it had complied fully with its rulings and should not be facing tariffs.\n\nBut so many questions remain: will it get the exemption? If not, will British products be taxed during less than two weeks? They new tariffs come into force on the 18th of October, 13 days before Britain is due to leave the EU.", "description": "In a move that threatens to ignite a transatlantic trade war the US is set to impose tariffs on 6.8 billion euros of EU goods.", "authors": ["Oleksandra Vakulina"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/53/64/1000x563_cmsv2_65f9e47e-a7fe-5153-a2ea-d0158a356153-4205364.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
