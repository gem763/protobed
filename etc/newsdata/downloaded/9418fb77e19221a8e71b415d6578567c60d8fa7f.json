The White House the same day said it would no longer cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorneys said that he does not have the power to share documents related to his official responsibilities sought by the committees because they are the property of the federal government and that it will be up to the State Department to do so.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland does not control the disposition of his documents. By federal law and regulation, the State Department has sole authority to produce such documents, and Ambassador Sondland hopes the materials will be shared with the Committees in advance of his Thursday testimony,\u201d his attorneys said.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett Schiff'Off-script' Trump rails against impeachment, Democrats at feisty rally Schiff should consider using RICO framework to organize impeachment Overnight Energy: Dems subpoena Perry in impeachment inquiry | EPA to overhaul rules on lead contamination tests | Commerce staff wrote statement rebuking weather service for contradicting Trump MORE (D-Calif.) told reporters earlier this week that the State Department was withholding text messages or emails stored on Sondland\u2019s personal device that Democrats believe to be relevant to the impeachment inquiry\n\nNeither the White House nor the State Department immediately responded to requests for comment on the decision by Sondland to testify.\n\nSondland, a wealthy hotel magnate who donated $1 million to President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocratic 2020 hopefuls tout LGBTQ plans at town hall Trump defends Syria move at rally: 'Bring our troops back home' Pompeo adviser resigning: report MORE\u2019s inaugural committee before being tapped as the U.S. ambassador to the EU, is viewed as a key witness for House Democrats as they investigate Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.

The president has specifically pointed to one text message exchange in which Sondland emphasized Trump had been \u201ccrystal clear\u201d about there being \u201cno quid pro quo\u2019s\u201d after another official, Bill Taylor, raised concerns the administration was withholding security aid to Ukraine \u201cfor help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are currently investigating whether Trump had held up assistance to Ukraine, which has since been released, in order to press for politically-motivated investigations. Trump and others in his administration have denied there was any quid pro quo and maintained that Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky was not improper and has nothing to do with the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe State Department directed Sondland not to appear for scheduled testimony on Tuesday. Trump wrote on Twitter that he would \u201clove\u201d for Sondland to testify but that he didn\u2019t trust Democrats\u2019 \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d\n\nLater that day, the White House sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi'Off-script' Trump rails against impeachment, Democrats at feisty rally Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Planned Parenthood charges into 2020 | PhRMA CEO warns against Pelosi drug pricing bill | Medicaid work requirements costing states millions On The Money: Trump to meet China's vice premier during trade talks | Appeals court says Deutsche Bank doesn't have Trump's tax returns | House Appropriations Chair Nita Lowey to retire MORE (D-Calif.) and the heads of three congressional committees Tuesday evening stating that the executive branch would not comply with House Democrats\u2019 \u201cillegitimate\u201d impeachment inquiry, accusing the Democrats of engaging in an effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone took issue with a number of facts of the Democrats\u2019 investigation, including Pelosi\u2019s decision not to hold a vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry on the House floor \u2014 as has been past precedent.
