KLM\n\nKLM turns 100 this year, making it the oldest airline still in operation. Courtesy J. A. Hampton/Topical Press Agency/Getty Images\n\nYear of foundation: 1919\n\nFirst flight: May 1920\n\nPassengers transported in the first year: 440\n\nPassengers transported in 2018: 34.2 million\n\nAs a nation that once had the largest merchant fleet in the world, it seems fitting that the Dutch were among the first to set up a national airline that became a strong force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe need to connect Amsterdam to what was then known as the Dutch East Indies would certainly have been a powerful motivation to get KLM off the ground in the early days.\n\nAlthough formally founded in October 1919, the new airline did not really take off until May 1920, when a four-seater De Havilland DH.16 made the inaugural flight to London's now defunct Croydon Airport.\n\nIn 1924, KLM launched a service from Amsterdam to Batavia (as Jakarta was then known), the world's longest air route at the time.\n\nIn 1946, it became the first European airline to begin scheduled flights to New York, using DC-4 aircraft.\n\nThroughout its nearly hundred years of existence, KLM's commitment to innovation has been constant.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to its fleet either. The airline has also proved pioneering with its use of social media, introducing the first social media-driven flight schedule.\n\n2. Avianca\n\nAvianca has been the national airline of Colombia since 1919. JUAN MABROMATA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYear of foundation: 1919\n\nFirst flight: 1919\n\nPassengers transported in 2018: 30.5 million\n\nFounded by German immigrants in Barranquilla, Colombia, in 1919, Avianca was originally named SCADTA and operated Junkers F13 aircraft, some of which were equipped with floats.\n\nRelated content Pioneering aircraft from 1919 back in 21st century\n\nAs the world moved closer to war In the late 1930s, SCADTA became a source of concern for the US government, who were worried about the security implications of the airline's links to Germany.\n\nPan American World Airways subsequently acquired a controlling stake in the company.\n\nIn 1949, SCADTA merged with fellow Colombian airline SACO (Servicio A\u00e9reo Colombiano) and adopted its current name.\n\nToday, after absorbing several airlines in neighboring countries, Avianca is one of the largest airline groups in Latin America, with a fleet of 173 aircraft and a network of subsidiaries that spans pretty much the whole continent.\n\n3. Qantas\n\nThe Qantas logo is known as \"The Flying Kangaroo.\" Qantas\n\nYear of foundation: 1920\n\nPassengers transported in 2018: 55.3 million\n\nFew people outside of Australia know that Qantas stands for \"Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services.\"\n\nAs its name indicates, the initial goal of the airline was to service the tropical and sparsely populated lands of Northern Australia.\n\nIts first aircraft was an Avro 504, a pre-World War I biplane that could seat a pilot and one passenger.\n\nQantas was nationalized by the Australian government after World War II and reprivatized in the '90s.\n\nIts kangaroo livery first appeared in 1944 and accompanied the airline during the airline's expansion throughout the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.\n\nToday Qantas remains the de facto flag carrier of Australia as well as the country's largest airline and one of its best known brands globally.\n\nRelated content What it's like to fly nonstop from Australia to the UK\n\n4. Aeroflot\n\nAeroflot was the largest airline in the world during the Soviet era. Stanislav Sergeev/Alamy\n\nYear of foundation: 1923\n\nFirst flight: July 1923\n\nPassengers transported in 2018: 55.7 million\n\nA flight from Moscow to Nizhny Novgorod carrying six people (four passengers and two crewmen) on a Junkers F13 marked the start of what would turn out to be the Soviet Union's, and later, the Russian Federation's flag carrier.\n\nOriginally called Dobrolet, it was renamed Aeroflot in 1932, when the Soviet government decided to place the whole civilian aviation fleet under one single entity.\n\nAfter World War II, Aeroflot became the largest airline in the world, as air travel was often the only means of transportation available to bridge the vast expanses of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1956, the airline introduced the Tupolev Tu-104, considered the first truly successful jet airliner.\n\nDuring the Cold War years, Aeroflot operated the long range Il-62, which flew all the way to Cuba by way of Murmansk, in the Arctic, and the supersonic Tupolev Tu-144, the Soviet Union's answer to the Concorde.\n\nIn much the same fashion as the Soviet Union, Aeroflot was separated in the '90s and divided into a number of regional airlines, with some former Soviet republics beginning their own services.\n\nThe core of the airline then came under control of Russia and remains state-owned.\n\nAeroflot underwent a massive transformation during the first decade of the 21st century in terms of both service and fleet.\n\nBar its hammer and sickle logo, the Aeroflot of today bears little resemblance to its original conception.\n\n5. Czech Airlines (CSA)\n\nCzech Airlines, the national airline of the Czech Republic. MICHAL CIZEK/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYear of foundation: 1923\n\nFirst flight: October 1923\n\nPassengers transported in 2018: 2.9 million\n\nStarted as a national airline for the then newly founded country of Czechoslovakia, Czech Airlines' activity was interrupted by World War II and the airline was later reinstated by the post-war Communist government.\n\nIn 1957, CSA became the third airline, after BOAC and Aeroflot, to operate jet airliners when it put the Soviet-made Tupolev Tu104A into service.\n\nThe airline was also the first to operate a jet-only connection: Prague to Moscow.\n\nDuring the Cold War years, CSA operated a remarkably large operation that included a fleet of up to 21 long range Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft as well as an extensive route network covering the Americas, Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nUnfortunately it also suffered two unfortunate firsts, becoming the first airline to suffer a mass hijacking, when three of its aircraft were diverted to West Germany by defectors in 1950.\n\nIt was also the first airline to lose a captain at the hands of a hijacker, in an incident during the 1970s.\n\nLike many national airlines of the former Eastern Bloc, CSA was renamed, restructured and modernized during the '90s.\n\nThe airline is now majority-owned by Czech group Travel Service.\n\n6. Finnair\n\nThe Finnish government has a 55.8% holding of Finnair. Courtesy Finnair\n\nYear of foundation: 1923\n\nFirst flight: March 1924\n\nPassengers transported in 2017: 13.2 million\n\nFor those who've ever wondered why Finnair's airline code is \"AY\", this is derived from the name it used before being rebranded to Finnair in 1953 -- \"Aero O/Y.\"\n\nDuring its first 12 years, the airline operated only seaplanes, a logical choice given the many lakes and water inlets that cover the surface of Finland.\n\nIn 1983, it became the first European airline to fly non-stop to Tokyo, with DC-10 aircraft.\n\nFive years later, Finnair was the only European airline with a direct flight between Europe and China.\n\nThis helped to position the airline as the shortest gateway between Europe and Asia, largely thanks to Helsinki's location atop the Great Circle route.\n\n7. Delta Air Lines\n\nDelta is the oldest airline still operating in the US. DANIEL SLIM/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYear of foundation: 1924\n\nPassengers transported in 2018: 192.5 million\n\nDelta has grown from a small crop-dusting operation in America's Deep South to the largest airline in the world by some measures.\n\nTwo important corporate decisions helped consolidate it at the top of the global airline leagues -- the purchase of Pan Am's East Coast and European routes in the early '90s and its merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008.\n\nDelta is one of the world's largest airlines in terms of scheduled passengers.\n\n8. Tajik Air (until January 2019)\n\nYear of foundation: 1924\n\nPassengers transported in 2017: 356,000\n\nTajikistan, a former Soviet Republic nested amidst the mountains of Central Asia, must be one of the few places on Earth where the arrival of the airplanes predates the introduction of cars and trains.\n\nThe airline operated as one of Aeroflot's regional subsidiaries for decades.\n\nIt became a standalone operation in 1924, recovering its independence at the same time as its home country, in the early '90s.\n\nThe airline survived World War II and the break-up of the Soviet Union, but not the financial instability of recent years and it ceased operations in January 2019.\n\nRelated content Pioneering aircraft from 1919 back in 21st century\n\n9. Air Serbia\n\nAir Serbia serves more than 40 destinations across Europe, the Mediterranean and Middle East. ANDREJ ISAKOVIC/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYear of foundation: 1927\n\nPassengers transported in 2017: 2.62 million\n\nAir Serbia claims descent from the several airlines that operated as flag carriers of Yugoslavia (hence its code JU), starting with Aeroput in 1927 and Jat Airways from 1948.\n\nDuring the Cold War years, Jat developed a significant route network and bought equipment from both East and West, in line with Yugoslavia's status as a non-aligned country.\n\nAfter the breakup of Yugoslavia, Jat became the Serbian flag carrier.\n\nIn 2013, Etihad bought a 49% equity stake in the company, which then engaged in a massive recapitalization and rebranding operation that saw it adopt the new name of Air Serbia.\n\n10. Iberia\n\nAlmost 900 million customers have flown with Iberia in the 90 years since it was founded. Jasper Juinen/Getty Images\n\nYear of foundation: 1927\n\nFirst flight: December 1927\n\nPassengers transported in 2017: 54.9 million\n\nFormerly a privately owned company, Iberia was put under government sponsorship shortly after its launch, providing postal transport between Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nAfter an operational hiatus in the early 1930s, it was resurrected with German assistance, by the nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nAfter the war, Iberia, now firmly in government hands, developed as Spain's flag carrier.\n\nIn 1946, it was the first airline to fly between Europe and South America, a region that has remained at the core of Iberia's long haul business throughout its history.", "description": "From KLM in the Netherlands to Delta in the United States, here are 10 airlines that have stood the test of time in a volatile industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190219165104-worlds-oldest-airlines---avianca---getty-images-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-04"}
