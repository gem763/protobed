The beach is just 20 minutes away and downtown Charleston is very walkable.\n\nIn spring 2019, British Airways launched twice-weekly direct flights to the South Carolinan city, departing on Thursday afternoon and returning Monday morning, offering the intoxicating opportunity for a weekend break.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHere are the best things to do in the city.\n\nSee the pineapple fountain\n\nA sweet, if rather odd, icon of Charleston is the pineapple fountain frothing in the Waterfront Park. In the hot summer months, it\u2019s also a good place to cool off, and local kids enjoy splashing about in it. The pineapple is the defacto icon of Charleston: it\u2019s believed that on one of his voyages to America, Christopher Columbus discovered the fruit and brought it back to Europe.\n\nWander Rainbow Row\n\nGround zero of Charleston\u2019s cutesy Historic District, which stretches down to oak tree-shaded White Point Park, is the pastel row of houses that make up Rainbow Row on East Bay Street. A stretch of 13 fondant fancy-coloured townhouses, the longest stretch of Georgian houses in America, line up prettily with white shutters and historic plaques. Just follow the gaggle of Instagrammers taking selfies.\n\nVisit the Old Slave Mart Museum\n\nThis city, like many in the American South, has a complicated relationship with slavery. This history is examined to some degree at the Old Slave Mart Museum on Chalmers Street in the Historic District. It\u2019s built on the site of the former slave mart, believed to be the last slave auction facility in the state. Open Monday to Saturday, 9am-5pm; entry US$8.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There are plenty to choose from, but perhaps the grandest are the Nathaniel Russell house, the Georgian double-style Heyward-Washington house and the buttermilk yellow Aiken Rhett mansion, where governor of South Carolina William Aiken Jr once lived.\n\nExplore the surrounding Lowcountry\n\nThe Lowcountry \u2013 the coastal, marshy lands that stretch from South Carolina into Georgia further south \u2013 is picture-perfect with dripping Spanish moss, forests of oak trees and heat like an electric blanket.\n\nPalmetto Bluff, two hours\u2019 drive south from Charleston towards Savannah, Georgia, is set in the midst of this marshland and home to the upscale resort of Montage Palmetto Bluff, where alligators prowl the waters and \u201cporching\u201d is a local sport.\n\nClop around town in a horse-drawn carriage\n\nThe quintessential Charleston thing to do is to be pulled around the shaded historic streets in a traditional horse-drawn carriage. In an hour-long narrated tour, carriages set off from Anson Street and go on a random route chosen by a bingo ball. Tours cost $25pp.\n\nCheck into The Dewberry\n\nWhat is a dowdy former federal building from the outside is a whirr of mid-century flair inside: think burgundy leather banquettes and armchairs, period features and a giant metal-worked map of South Carolina on the wall. There\u2019s a boutique outpost of beloved Southern magazine Garden & Gun on the ground floor and Henrietta\u2019s brasserie serves reimagined Lowcountry cuisine.\n\nEat shrimp and grits\n\nSlightly North of Broad (or Snob for short) does a decent line in fun Southern cuisine on the well-trodden East Bay Street in the Historic District. The shrimp and grits, a quintessential Southern dish, comes with giant prawns and creamy local grits (a sort of minced corn) packed with plenty of flavour. Brunch is popular, so book ahead.\n\nHave a cocktail at Citrus Club\n\nEight floors above the Dewberry is playful cocktail lounge Citrus Club, serving look-at-me concoctions such as the frozen pina colada and the Polynesian pearl diver. You can only get up here either by being a guest of the hotel or by booking in advance. Open Wednesday to Sunday, 2-10pm.\n\nVisit the Charleston City Market\n\nCrossing four blocks in the Historic Quarter is the fan-cooled Charleston City Market, which first opened in 1804. Today it sells trinkets such as local art, ceramics, coffee and clothing \u2013 if you need a souvenir, this place is the first place to look. For fresh produce and local art, visit the Saturday morning farmers\u2019 market in Marion Square.\n\nGawp at \u2018single houses\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s a riot of architectural styles in Charleston, ranging from Art Deco and Queen Anne to Italianate and Gothic Revival, but the one defining style is the \u201csingle house\u201d, which are all over the Historic Quarter, usually hiding under the shade of an oak tree. They are narrow, single-room houses that date back to the 1800s.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nBritish Airways runs a twice-weekly direct service from London Heathrow to Charleston, which takes nine hours.
