Believe her,\" she continued.\n\n\"One day, she might stand in front of you and say 'thank you' for allowing her to succeed because of her work place environment and not in spite of it.\"\n\nWilliams was famously paid less than $1,000 for re-shoots for the movie \"All the Money in the World,\" while her co-star, Mark Wahlberg, made $1.5 million, which made her earnings less than 1% of his.\n\n\"The discrepancy in 'All the Money in the World' was so huge that it really illustrated a larger point, not just for myself,\" she said backstage. \"If it was this difficult for me -- a white woman in a privileged industry -- how difficult is it for women of color across all industries?\"\n\n\"While tonight is a kind of fairy tale ending for me -- my own personal story -- there really won't be any satisfaction for me until the larger message is heard,\" she added.\n\nThe actress spoke to lawmakers on Capitol Hill in April 2019 about her fight for equality and support for the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\nThe bill was passed in the House in March, but has yet to pass the Senate.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/williams-01-as-gty-190922_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
