Some call it an impeachment investigation,\u201d Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said, arguing that a House vote is not necessary. \u201cThere is no legal difference between these terms, and I no longer care to argue about the nomenclature.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2063/1155968404_6085709065001_6085703631001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nThe resolution, which Nadler billed as a \u201cnecessary next step\u201d in its months-long investigation, allows Trump and his lawyers to formally respond to evidence and testimony presented in the committee\u2019s hearings.\n\nThe measure also preemptively triggers a House rule that allows staffers to question witnesses for an hour at the end of every hearing deemed part of the impeachment investigation. It describes the panel\u2019s ability to accept evidence in secret \u201cexecutive sessions,\u201d and it authorizes the subcommittees to hold hearings and question witnesses in order to expedite the process.\n\nRepublicans ripped the measure as a meaningless gesture that simply points to procedures already available in the House and committee\u2019s rules. Nadler has said the resolution is an important step to acknowledge the panel\u2019s investigation and to deploy the procedural mechanisms in advance of impeachment-related hearings.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, said Democrats were trying to make it appear that they were toughening their stance on impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe Judiciary Committee has become a giant Instagram filter,\u201d Collins quipped. \u201cTo make it appear that something\u2019s happening that is not.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants the appearance of something that is not,\u201d Collins said of Nadler.\n\nIn late July, the committee for the first time referred to its investigation as an impeachment probe, telling federal courts that the panel is considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House. It was part of an effort to secure documents and witness testimony that Democrats say are critical for its investigation, and remain tied up in court amid blockades from the White House and the Justice Department.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) said Democrats were trying to \u201chave your impeachment and deny it too.\u201d Republicans also noted that Democrats do not have enough support among their caucus for a vote on the House floor to authorize an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe committee kicked off its investigation into the president in March, focusing on allegations of corruption and abuses of power. The following month, special counsel Robert Mueller completed his investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election, and Trump\u2019s efforts to interfere with the probe.\n\nMueller\u2019s report documented several potential incidents of obstruction of justice, including a directive from Trump to his then-White House Counsel, Don McGahn, to fire Mueller and shut down his investigation.\n\nMore recently, Democrats have zeroed in on allegations that Trump is violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which seek to ensure that presidents do not benefit financially from government spending \u2014 by the U.S. or foreign governments.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee is investigating Trump\u2019s recent suggestion that next year\u2019s G7 summit be held at his Doral resort in Florida, in addition to Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s recent stay at a Trump-owned property in Ireland.\n\nAdditionally, the House Oversight and Reform Committee is probing military stays at Trump\u2019s resort in Turnberry, Scotland, during stopovers from the U.S. to the Middle East.\n\nNadler has said that the committee will decide by the end of the year whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House. Some articles have already been referred to the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cWe have a constitutional, historical, and moral obligation to fully investigate these matters,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cLet us take the next step in that work without delay.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle and Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "The committee approved guidelines for its impeachment probe, while the speaker avoided the issue at a news conference.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b3/e9/7f2aa62a48a0ba3ae41c0d6503e4/190912-nadler-rahman.png"}
