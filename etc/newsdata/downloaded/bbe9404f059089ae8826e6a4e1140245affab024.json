(Hannity did not respond to a request for comment). And according to four sources, Fox Corp CEO Lachlan Murdoch is already thinking about how to position the network for a post-Trump future. A person close to Lachlan told me that Fox News has been the highest rated cable network for seventeen years, and \u201cthe success has never depended on any one administration.\u201d (A Fox Corp spokesperson declined to comment.)\n\nInside Fox News, tensions over Trump are becoming harder to contain as a long-running cold war between the network\u2019s news and opinion sides turns hot. Fox has often taken a nothing-to-see-here approach to Trump scandals, but impeachment is a different animal. \u201cIt\u2019s management bedlam,\u201d a Fox staffer told me. \u201cThis massive thing happened, and no one knows how to cover it.\u201d The schism was evident this week as a feud erupted between afternoon anchor Shepard Smith and prime-time host Tucker Carlson. It started Tuesday when Fox legal analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano told Smith on-air that Trump committed a \u201ccrime\u201d by pressuring Ukraine\u2019s president to get dirt on Biden. That night, Carlson brought on former Trump lawyer Joe diGenova, who called Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d for claiming Trump broke the law. Yesterday, Smith lashed back, calling Carlson \u201crepugnant\u201d for not defending Napolitano on air. (Trump himself is said to turn off Fox at 3 p.m., when Shep Smith airs.) Seeking to quell the internecine strife before it carried into a third day, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and president Jay Wallace communicated to Smith this morning to stop attacking Carlson, a person briefed on the conversation said. \u201cThey said if he does it again, he\u2019s off the air,\u201d the source said. (Fox News spokesperson Irena Briganti denied that management had any direct conversation with Smith).", "description": "", "authors": ["Gabriel Sherman", "Vanityfair.Com News Madness-At-Fox-News-As-Trump-Faces-Impeachment-Lachlan-Murdoch"], "top_image": ""}
