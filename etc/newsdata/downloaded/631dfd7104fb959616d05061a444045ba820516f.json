We have been told that a team of hackers had been brought in by Dr Ghani\u2019s team.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Saudis and the Emiratis feel they have been left behind despite all the money, the resources they have spent in Afghanistan helping the Taliban over the years. They want to take the peace initiative away from the Qataris if they can.\u201d\n\nSaudi and Emirati diplomats, as well as Mr Ghani\u2019s team, strongly denied that there has been any collusion between them during the election campaign. And no evidence has been produced to support the claims. Daud Noorzai, the president\u2019s Chief of Staff, has repeatedly stressed that the Ghani campaign has been transparent and has taken the utmost care to avoid being connected with impropriety.\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia were the only states, apart from Pakistan, which recognised the Taliban regime of Mullah Mohammad Omar as the legitimate government of Afghanistan during its five years in power.\n\nThere are a large number of diplomats and officials from the Kingdom, UAE and Qatar present in Kabul during the election campaign and all three states maintain a sizeable presence in the country.\n\nFive Emirati diplomats were killed in a bombing in Kandahar in 2017 when inaugurating projects in the city: the ambassador, Juma Mohammed Abdullah al-Kaabi, later died from his injuries.\n\nDonald Trump suspended the Doha talks in early September after a Taliban attack killed an American serviceman. But there is widespread expectation that they will resume, with the US president desperate to bring troops home and claim credit for ending the longest war in American history in time for his re-election bid next year.\n\nThe negotiations had been held between an American team led by Zalmay Khalilzad \u2013 an Afghan-American and a former ambassador to Afghanistan \u2013 and a Taliban delegation based in Qatar and augmented by senior officials from Pakistan.\n\nThere has been strong criticism of the talks from various quarters. The Afghan government was excluded from them, and Khalilzad was accused of giving away too much in a draft agreement to the Talibs, without getting anything much in return.\n\nPresident Ghani was a vocal critic of the draft agreement. Other international politicians and officials had also cautioned against the projected deal, including senior figures in the US Congress such as Republican Lindsay Graham.\n\n\u201cPerhaps some of the lobbying firms working for Dr Ghani in the US were one reason why Mr Khalilzad failed to deliver, we don\u2019t know who was behind hiring these lobbyists\u201d, said Mr Massoud.\n\nIn January the Taliban complained about a scheduled meeting in Riyadh with the Americans, claiming that the Saudis would use the opportunity to push them to talk to the Afghan government and also water down their negotiating position.\n\nA Taliban leader told Reuters at the time that \u201cdifferences between Saudi Arabia and Qatar have in fact damaged our peace process. The Saudis unnecessarily put pressure on us to announce a ceasefire which even the US delegation didn\u2019t pursue.\u201d\n\nShortly after the UAE and Saudi Arabia severed relations with Qatar in June 2017, leaked emails between Emirati and US diplomats revealed that the UAE was vying to be the venue for the Taliban talks in 2011, at the same time the group was setting up office in Doha.\n\nAnother leaked email in January 2018 from Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to Washington, expressed to an American expressed the \u201canger\u201d of the Emirati Foreign Minister, Abdullah bin Zayed (ABZ) over the fact that Qatar had taken such a prominent role in the Taliban negotiations.\n\nMr Massoud also claimed that there were reports that President Ghani\u2019s team will claim victory on Sunday and declare himself winner of the election. \u201cThe other candidates would not accept this if it happens. We shall form a council to oppose it. We feel there will be fraud in this election, it is a very dangerous situation,\u201d he said.\n\nAbdullah Abdullah, co-leader with Mr Ghani in the outgoing administration, and his main rival in the election, also maintained there is likely to be widespread voter fraud.\n\n\u201cWe have registered quite a few complaints, but this is just the tip of the iceberg\u201d, he said. \u201cMy main concern will be that massively fraudulent elections will have an impact on the mentality of the people on whether the democratic process has been functioning or not. If there is massive fraud, and somebody is announced as a winner, this will not be accepted.\u201d\n\nPresident Ghani said that he was not willing to go into another power sharing arrangement if there was no overall majority. \u201cAfghanistan must have one President, not two. I will not accept another national unity government. God willing I expect to win the election during the first round, I believe and trust the decision is in the hands of the Afghan people,\u201d he stated ahead of Saturday\u2019s vote.\n\nMr Ghani wanted to stress: \u201cMy opponents can only challenge the election results in a court of law, not in a personal way. Our security and defence institutions are completely neutral and they are the guardians of the law. We don\u2019t have the same dangers and threats that we have had in previous elections.\u201d\n\nMore than 100,000 security personnel will be deployed across the country for the election, with US-led international forces providing air support. Around 29,500 polling stations have been set up in schools, mosques, hospitals and government building. But nearly 1,500 polling stations would remain closed because adequate protection could not be guaranteed.\n\nRead the first part of the Conflict Without End series here: Afghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption; and the second part here: Afghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: \u2018My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up\u2019; and the third part here: Raid on al-Qaeda bomb factory leaves dozens of wedding-goers dead, in latest Afghan violence\u200b and the fourth part here On the Afghan campaign trail in the shadow of the destroyed Buddhas of Bamiyan, talk of Taliban return divides\u200b", "description": "Bitter rivalries among the Gulf states are being secretly played out in Afghanistan\u2019s impending election, with \u201chidden foreign hands\u201d trying to manipulate the result, a leading candidate has claimed on the eve of the poll.
