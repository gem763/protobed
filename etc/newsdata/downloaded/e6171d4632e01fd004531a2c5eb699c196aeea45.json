In her account, one night over drinks with Vieira at the hotel bar where the NBC News team was staying, they ran into Lauer, who joined them. At the end of the night, Nevils, who\u2019d had six shots of vodka, ended up going to Lauer\u2019s hotel room twice \u2014 once to retrieve her press credential, which Lauer had taken as a joke, and the second time because he invited her back. Nevils, Farrow writes, \u201chad no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience.\u201d\n\nOnce she was in his hotel room, Nevils alleges, Lauer \u2014 who was wearing a T-shirt and boxers \u2014 pushed her against the door and kissed her. He then pushed her onto the bed, \u201cflipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cShe said that she declined several times.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nevils, she \u201cwas in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested again when he \u2018just did it,\u2019\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cLauer, she said, didn\u2019t use lubricant. The encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u2018It hurt so bad. I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u2019 She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d Lauer then asked her if she liked it. She tells him yes. She claims that \u201cshe bled for days,\u201d Farrow writes.", "description": "", "authors": ["Variety.Com Tv News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
