By the time I had finished my first pint they had run out.\n\nBeer lovers, who paid \u00a311.50 for entry, were offered refunds or cider (Picture: VisitDorset/BNPS)\n\n\u2018We are a civilised crowd us real ale drinkers so we didn\u2019t kick off but some people walked out in disappointment. I will certainly not be coming again.\u2019\n\nColin Bell was equally as disappointed, taking to social media to write: \u2018I couldn\u2019t help but agree with another punter who said \u2018CAMRA couldn\u2019t organise a p*ss up in a beer festival!\u2019\u2019\n\nSteve Jones added: \u2018The event was seriously badly organised. Surely if there\u2019s a run on stock they should have a back up plan to get more in.\n\n\u2018In all the years of beer festivals, I\u2019ve never known anything like it.\u2019\n\nThe Oktoberfest event was attended by 900 people who drank 4,000 pints of beer and cider over two days.\n\nResponding to complaints, the West Dorset branch of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) said they had to adhere to strict guidelines issued by their national body over the amount of beer and cider they could order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, a spokesman said: \u2018The West Dorset branch of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) we would like to make it publicly known that the reason we sold out of beer so early Saturday night, disappointing the majority of Saturday night customers was due to the governs of CAMRA\u2019s national budgeting policy for ordering quantities of beer and cider for CAMRA beer festivals.\n\n\u2018We were adhering to those strict guidelines for the festival to happen.\n\n\u2018Customers were compensated for their disappointment with extra tokens for cider and refunds were given if requested.\u201d\n\nCAMRA bar manager Rich Gabe said: \u2018It\u2019s a shame we were not able to offer Saturday night customers the fantastic range of beer that was on offer at the previous sessions.\n\n\u2018This is an issue that has been notified to CAMRA\u2019s head office in St Albans and we are awaiting a response.\u2019\n\nChildren who bite others at nursery given 'bite box' to distract them\n\nCatherine Tonry, National Festival Organiser for CAMRA, said: \u2018CAMRA operates a policy in that each local festival applies for beer festival funding based on the number of visitors they expect through the door.\n\n\u2018The Weymouth branch\u2019s beer order was based on previous atendee numbers \u2013 obviously, the festival was much more popular this year than ever before.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great to see the people of Weymouth enjoying the range of brews available at a CAMRA fest, and we\u2019re confident that the success will encourage the branch to order more beer for next year.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
