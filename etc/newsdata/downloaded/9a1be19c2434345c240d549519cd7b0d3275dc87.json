No advance as of now. \u2014 Mustafa Bali (@mustefabali) October 9, 2019\n\nThe multi-faceted Turkish assault meanwhile prompted civilians in the region to flee en masse, according to reports from the ground.\n\nOne resident of Tal Abyad who fled with his wife and mother by car to Raqqa, nearly 100km (60 miles) to the south, told the Associated Press news agency the road to the former de facto capital of ISIL's self-proclaimed caliphate was packed with vehicles and families.\n\nThe resident, who gave his name as Maher, said that some people were fleeing on foot \"to get away from the bombing\".\n\nTurkey's offensive prompted civilians to flee from the border region [Rodi Said/Reuters]\n\nAl Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from the Turkish town of Akcakale, said there was \"fear and tension\" on both sides of the border over the unfolding events, which threaten to open a new chapter in Syria's devastating eight-year-long war, and worsen regional turmoil.\n\n\"The big question is what kind of humanitarian crisis could such an operation cause,\" Stratford said.\n\n\"There are hundreds of thousands of people on the Syrian side, many of whom we understand are now fleeing towns and villages that SDF forces are based in and are being targeted in,\" he added. \"A very worrying and terrifying experience is unfolding for many people.\"\n\nISIL prisoners\n\nAdding to the uncertainty is the precarious situation surrounding the thousands of suspected ISIL fighters being held in SDF-run detention camps.\n\nSeveral international powers - including France, Germany, Britain and Saudi Arabia - have warned Turkey's operation puts at risk the progress made in battling back the armed group, which at its peak controlled large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq.\n\nThe SDF has warned that ISIL remains a threat in the region. On Monday, a day after announcing the capturing of an ISIL commander, the group warned a possible Turkish attack would \"reverse the successful effort to defeat ISIS\".\n\nOn Wednesday, a Kurdish source and two US officials told the Reuters news agency that the SDF had halted operations against ISIL because of the Turkish offensive.\n\nThat report came as the Kurdish-led group said one of the prisons where suspected ISIL members were being detained had been struck in a Turkish air raid.\n\nTurkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the border between Turkey and Syria on October 9 in Akcakale. [Burak Kara/Getty Images]\n\nWashington had said Turkey would be responsible for all suspected ISIL fighters captured during the battle against the armed group in Syria, but Trump on Wednesday told reporters the US had moved some of the prisoners amid fears they could escape custody during the Turkish operation.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, the US leader said that some of the \"most dangerous\" individuals had been moved, but he did not say how many or where they had been taken.\n\n\"We're putting them in different locations where it's secure,\" he added.\n\nUmit Yalcin, Turkish ambassador to the UK, told Sky News on Tuesday that Turkey was able to \"deal with\" the ISIL captives.\n\n\"We will handle this issue with our allies in cooperation ... We have that capacity and capability,\" he said.\n\nFahrettin Altun, Erdogan's communications director, also said on Wednesday Turkey was taking over leadership of the fight against ISIL in Syria.\n\nAltun added that Turkey had no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralise the threat against Turkish citizens and bring an end to what he called \"the yoke of armed thugs\" in the region.", "description": "Air raids and artillery fire pound border region before Turkish troops cross into Syria east of the Euphrates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/8ee8977ac90a46f6983132d8cd8979fb_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
