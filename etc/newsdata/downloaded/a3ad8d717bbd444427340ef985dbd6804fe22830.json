It\u2019s what the American people want.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: The U.S. House has voted to crack down on some of the most malicious acts of animal cruelty!\n\n\n\nNext step is to get it passed out of the Senate. This is a huge win for animals & could not have happened without YOU. \ud83c\udf89 https://t.co/rYKVoiaRy9 pic.twitter.com/mGwmtbswUk \u2014 The Humane Society of the United States (@HumaneSociety) October 22, 2019\n\nIf approved, the PACT Act would prohibit the intentional crushing, burning, drowning, suffocation, impalement or other violence causing \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to animals. The bill expands on a 2010 federal law that criminalized the creation and distribution of videos depicting animal cruelty. Animal fighting is also outlawed under federal law.\n\n\u201cThe torture of innocent animals is abhorrent and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d said Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) who, along with Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), introduced the PACT Act in the House. \u201cPassing the [bill] sends a strong message that this behavior will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. House just passed the #PACT Act, legislation that I introduced with my colleague @RepTedDeutch to criminalize animal abuse. This important piece of legislation would make animal cruelty a federal offense. Great news for my fellow animal lovers! pic.twitter.com/fK4qAppXnK \u2014 Rep. Vern Buchanan (@VernBuchanan) October 22, 2019\n\nViolators of the PACT Act would face federal felony charges, fines and up to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. However, the bill contains exceptions for hunting, normal veterinary care and \u201cconduct necessary to protect life or property from a serious threat caused by an animal,\u201d according to a press release about the measure.\n\nIf signed by the president, the PACT Act will not interfere with local animal cruelty laws or enforcement. All U.S. states have their own animal cruelty laws, but as Block explained to the Post, federal legislation will ensure that cases that span multiple jurisdictions or occur in airports, military bases and other places under federal jurisdiction could be properly prosecuted.\n\n\u201cMost people are shocked to know that the U.S. does not have a federal animal cruelty law,\u201d Holly Gann of the Animal Wellness Foundation said in a statement. \u201cEnacting this bill sends a signal that our nation has no tolerance for intentional cruelty toward animals.\u201d", "description": "The PACT Act would outlaw the intentional crushing, burning, drowning or other violence causing \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to animals.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db13fd1200000bf225069d2.jpeg?cache=bex7dsspdv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
