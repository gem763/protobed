In hindsight, that may not have been a good idea.\n\nWhen the host asked the secretary of State, for example, whether it\u2019s appropriate for the administration to condition military aid to a vulnerable ally on a political scheme, Pompeo replied, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into hypotheticals.\u201d\n\nThe problem, of course, is that there\u2019s nothing \u201chypothetical\u201d about this. It was just four days ago when the White House publicly acknowledged the scheme.\n\nViewers were also treated to this gem:\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: [W]e do know that so much of \u2013 and this is by his own admission \u2013 that so much of this activity [in Ukraine] was being carried out by the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Was he acting with your blessing and supervision? POMPEO: George, I have had one consistent policy as the secretary of state, to not talk about internal deliberations inside the administration.\n\nBut therein lies the rub: Giuliani wasn\u2019t part of the administration.\n\nThere was also this exchange about former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch:\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: She testified and she put out this testimony that in late April she met with the Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who told her she was being removed even though she did nothing wrong. That\u2019s a quote. Why did you approve the removal of an ambassador who had done nothing wrong? POMPEO: George, again, I\u2019m not going to get into personnel matters inside the State Department.\n\nThat might be more compelling if Pompeo hadn\u2019t already told the public that Yovanovitch left her post for family reasons \u2013 a comment on \u201cpersonnel matters inside the State Department\u201d that turned out to be false.\n\nThe rest of the interview wasn\u2019t much better. When the cabinet secretary wasn\u2019t dodging key questions, he was taking cheap shots at veteran State Department officials like Bill Burns. Pompeo\u2019s entire ABC News appearance seemed designed to make Donald Trump happy, which was very likely the rationale for agreeing to sit down for the interview in the first place.\n\nBut the fact remains that the State Department is reeling under Pompeo\u2019s leadership. Key officials are resigning. There was even a recent controversy surrounding career officials facing political retribution based on their perceived fealty to Donald Trump. The Associated Press had this report two weeks ago \u2026\n\nThe State Department has been deeply shaken by the rapidly escalating impeachment inquiry, as revelations that President Donald Trump enlisted diplomats to dig up dirt on a political rival threaten to tarnish its reputation as a nonpartisan arm of U.S. foreign policy, former senior officials say. A department where morale was already low under a president who, at times, has seemed hostile to its mission is now reeling from days of disclosures that place it at the center of an escalating political scandal, according to former diplomats who fear that the turmoil will damage American foreign policy objectives around the world.\n\n\u2026 and by most measures, conditions are worse now.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Pompeo, up to his neck in Trump\u2019s scandal, couldn\u2019t answer questions from WSMV\u2019s Nancy Amon on Oct. 11, and he wasn\u2019t much better with George Stephanopoulos nine days later.\n\nIs it any wonder some observers are calling for the secretary of State\u2019s resignation?", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, caught up in Donald Trump's Ukraine scandal, seems unable or unwilling to answer key questions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_ruhle_pompeo_191002_1920x1080.jpg?itok=X_w4PVVK", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
