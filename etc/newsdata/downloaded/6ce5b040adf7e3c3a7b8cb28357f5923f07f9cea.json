(Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nVirginia Democrat Dan Helmer got a boost in his bid to unseat Del. Tim Hugo when presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke appeared by his side over the Labor Day weekend to whip up voter enthusiasm in a pivotal state election this November.\n\nO\u2019Rourke traveled throughout the state over the weekend, driving home the message that national Democrats want to flip control of the Virginia legislature in part to build momentum for the race for the White House.\n\n\u201cAs important as 2020 is, the road to get there runs through 2019,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said at a rally Saturday in Fairfax County.\n\nO\u2019Rourke also campaigned with Del. Chris L. Hurst (D-Montgomery), who is defending his southwestern Virginia seat against Republican Forrest Hite, and Democrat Amy Laufer in her bid to unseat state Sen. Bryce E. Reeves (R-Spotsylvania) in a district that runs between Charlottesville and Fredericksburg.\n\nAll 140 state General Assembly seats are on the ballot in November. Republicans hold a three-seat edge in the House (51 to 48) and a bare majority in the Senate (20 to 19), with one vacant seat in each chamber. While four states will hold elections this fall, Virginia is the only one where control of the state legislature is at stake.\n\nHugo, who is seeking an eighth term, is the sole Republican state delegate remaining in increasingly blue Northern Virginia. His purple district straddles Fairfax and Prince William counties.\n\nHe has outraised Helmer by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, with nearly $800,000, a sizable bulk of which has come from the state GOP leadership, according to the nonprofit Virginia Public Access Project.\n\nThe party\u2019s CommonSense VA political action committee has contributed $80,500 to Hugo\u2019s campaign, while the Colonial Leadership Trust PAC controlled by House Speaker Kirk Cox (R-\n\nColonial Heights) has donated $20,000. Hugo is chairman of the GOP House caucus.\n\n[Virginia Republican in close race now backs \u2018red flag\u2019 gun bill]\n\nHelmer, who has raised $432,000, has focused primarily on gun issues in the midst a string of mass shootings this year, included an attack by a gunman who killed 12 people in Virginia Beach in May. Hugo\u2019s district is the kind of suburban area where increasingly urgent concerns about gun violence could make the difference for voters.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who has increasingly been talking about guns on the campaign trail, visited Helmer\u2019s campaign headquarters Saturday evening, just hours after a gunman killed seven people in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s home state of Texas. It provided a moment of confluence between the two campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the motivation is. We do not yet know the firearms that were used or how they acquired them,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said about the Saturday shooting. \u201cBut we do know this is f---ed up. This one is on all of us. Virginia will set the course for the United States of America.\u201d\n\nA former Army intelligence officer in Afghanistan, Iraq and South Korea, Helmer has repeatedly attacked Hugo over his support for expanding gun owners\u2019 rights, taunting the Republican on social media with challenges to debate the gun issue.\n\nOn Sunday, Helmer briefly confronted Hugo at an India Independence Day festival in Bull Run, again challenging him to a debate focused on guns.\n\nHugo declined, saying he would prefer to engage voters during three community forums already planned for the election.\n\nHugo, who won his 2017 election by just 106 votes, has walked a fine line on the gun issue.\n\nHis voting record has earned the Republican an A rating from the National Rifle Association. But Hugo recently expressed support for a \u201cred flag\u201d bill that would remove guns from some people considered a risk to themselves or others, although advocates for stronger gun laws said the bill is relatively weak and mimics mental health laws that are already in place.\n\nHugo, who served in the Army Reserve during the 1990s, says his support for the bill introduced by Del. Jason S. Miyares (R-Virginia Beach) is not related to the election, noting that he has backed other measures to keep firearms away from people who are considered potentially violent.\n\n[Beto O\u2019Rourke restarts campaign with bleak verdict on nation\u2019s gun problem]\n\nAt the Saturday rally, Helmer accused Hugo of voting against \u201cevery single piece of meaningful gun regulation\u201d that has been introduced during his time in office.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for a commonwealth where you don\u2019t feel like you need to wear the body armor I wore in Afghanistan just to go shopping at a Walmart,\u201d Helmer said, referring to the Aug. 3 shooting in El Paso that killed 22 people.\n\nQuentin Kidd, director of Christopher Newport University\u2019s Wason Center for Public Policy, said any national attention to the race would probably benefit Helmer.\n\nThe Democrat has garnered support from several national organizations, including an endorsement from the gun-control group formed by former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who has appeared at a fundraiser for Helmer.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a presidential candidate walking the streets for you, that tends to get your base and your core voters excited, and that\u2019s a good thing for Dan Helmer,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cTim Hugo needs to be able to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nHugo\u2019s campaign declined to allow The Washington Post to join him as he campaigned in his district but said he had been talking to voters about schools, roads and other bread-and-butter issues.\n\nRepublicans worked to use O\u2019Rourke\u2019s visit to rally their base.\n\nThey linked his visit to a controversy over late-term abortions in Virginia earlier this year.\n\nState GOP leaders highlighted a comment O\u2019Rourke made about late-term abortions while at a recent town hall event in Charleston, S.C.\n\nIn answer to a question, O\u2019Rourke said a woman should be allowed to decide on the best course of action, referencing the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that protects a woman\u2019s right to an abortion.\n\n\u201cOnly she knows what she knows, and I want to trust her with that,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans likened those comments to a statement by Del. Kathy Tran (D-Fairfax) in January about a failed bill she sponsored that would have loosened restrictions on late-term abortions.\n\nTran answered \u201cYes\u201d during a committee hearing about the legislation when asked whether the bill would allow for abortions during labor. She later said she misspoke, but Republicans accused her of supporting infanticide.\n\nRepublicans called on Helmer and other Democrats to rebuke O\u2019Rourke and said they plan to highlight Tran\u2019s comments as the campaign season heats up.\n\n\u201cWe have recognized this as a very powerful issue and a very powerful contrast between our candidates and the Democrats,\u201d said Garren Shipley, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah).\n\nA spokesman for Helmer said he agrees with O\u2019Rourke\u2019s position on abortion.\n\nKristin Pradko, 36, said that voters are more likely to be moved by anger over mass shootings and the fact that Virginia Republicans abruptly ended a special legislative session on gun control, convened in July by Gov. Ralph Northam (D), without considering a single bill.\n\nShe was among about a dozen members of the Moms Demand Action gun-control advocacy group who helped Helmer\u2019s campaign approach voters Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe minute I said, \u2018The reason I\u2019m supporting Dan Helmer is because he supports common-sense gun reforms,\u2019 their eyes lit up,\u201d said Pradko, who lives in Arlington, outside Hugo\u2019s district, and plans to continue reaching voters on Helmer\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cIf we can get some good stuff done here, it\u2019s a really good sign for reforms nationwide,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow Va.
