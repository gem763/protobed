It's been crazy to do this for so long, you know. I've been on a million red carpets and have been in television now from my MTV days,\u201d Daly told us. \u201cI was just a dude from California that was a DJ. I DJ'd in clubs and at radio stations and all of a sudden I'm on television.\n\n\"So I feel blessed, lucky. I think Lilly Singh is gonna do a great job in late-night, I'm happy for her. 'The Voice' is going strong. I feel like I have a home in the 'Today' show. I live in New York. I'm in L.A. all the time so, life is great.\u201d\n\nDaly said he didn\u2019t give any advice to Singh, 30, leading up to the premiere of \u201cA Little Late with Lilly Singh\u201d on Sept. 16.\n\nIn passing the torch to the history-making late-night network host, Daly gushed about Singh\u2019s talent saying he has no doubt she will kill it.\n\n\u201cYou know; she knows what to do. She's been great \u2013 her first week was great,\u201d Daly said. \u201cIt's refreshing. It's a shame it's taken this long to get a female going on a network show every night in late-night. So, we're happy for that and she's going to do great.\u201d\n\nCARSON DALY TALKS ABOUT BATTLE WITH ANXIETY AND PANIC ATTACKS: 'YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DYING'\n\n\u201cAnd she's Canadian. It's nice of us to finally give a Canadian a break on American television,\u201d the Emmy winner noted.\n\nWhen asked about the ascension he\u2019s been able to experience in his career, Daly said his biggest accomplishment has nothing to do with his padded resume and has everything to do with the purpose he found in being a father.\n\n\u201cWell, it'd be having kids, you know. I lost my father when I was 5,\" said Daly of his biological father, J. D., who died in 1979.\n\n\"My mom was incredible. Both my parents passed away two years ago,\" he added of his mother Patti and stepfather Richard, who both died a month apart in 2017.\n\n\u201cSo I understand the importance of parenting,\u201d Daly said. \u201cAnd this is all fun and games being up here dressed all nice. But at the end of the day, being a father is my greatest role in life. So I've got three kids \u2013 my beautiful wife is pregnant with our fourth right now. So you know, God is great.\u201d\n\nCARSON DALY QUITS RADIO SHOW TO 'HAVE BREAKFAST WITH MY KIDS'\n\nWhile the producer and director said the pair aren\u2019t sure yet about the gender of their forthcoming child, Daly made it an obvious point to shout his pal, DJ Khaled, who recently announced he and his partner were also expecting their second son.\n\n\u201cAnother one,\u201d Daly said, mimicking Khaled\u2019s trademarked slogan.\n\nThe host said returning to the Emmys is always a welcomed task and was quick to recognize that he and his wife were simply excited to get a break from their three children.\n\n\u201cNo, I mean it's cool when you're here and you're with, you know \u2013 these are people who are making the greatest shows in television and just to be a small part of that. I've been lucky enough to win, but to be nominated is cool,\u201d said Daly.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt's just, it's a fun night for me and my wife to get away from the kids and actually come and see friends that I haven't seen in a long time. So it's a nice night to catch up with friends in the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm one of the old school guys. I'm like an OG out here now,\u201d Daly joked as the magnitude of his fortitude seemingly set in.\n\n\u201cNo, I was here when like, 'The Sopranos' was winning everything. So I feel \u2013 I'm like one of the older guys.\u201d", "description": "Carson Daly's career in Hollywood has lasted more than two decades -- and with what he\u2019s been able to accomplish, some might\u00a0say he could easily be revered as the Godfather of Pop Culture.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/carson-daly.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
