But the difference between rich and wealthy is you rip the $50 in half and with the $25, you can do whatever you want. But with that other $25, you save it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe elaborate analogy and demonstration taught O\u2019Neal to attempt saving 75% of his earnings for taxes, retirement, investing, and long-term savings. In fact, according to Shaq, his savings plan enabled him to avoid touching the $40 million deal he signed with the Orlando Magic in 1992.\n\n\u201cI actually didn't touch my first check until I got married and started having children,\u201d Shaq said. \u201cSo Lester Knispel, thank you for that advice.\u201d\n\nShaquille O'Neal speaks onstage during the 19th Annual Harold and Carole Pump Foundation Gala at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on August 09, 2019 in Beverly Hills, California.

But the principle stands: O\u2019Neal\u2019s suggestion is to attempt to save as much as of one\u2019s income as possible to prepare for the future.\n\nAnd O\u2019Neal wasn\u2019t always the fiscally responsible saver. Knispel\u2019s lesson came after the basketball legend spent $1 million in one day after signing an endorsement deal with a trading card company. He reportedly bought two Mercedes Benz cars, paid off his mother\u2019s home mortgage, and bought jewelry for himself.\n\nLuckily for him, Knispel lesson served O\u2019Neal well as he developed his personal finance long game.\n\nStephanie is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
