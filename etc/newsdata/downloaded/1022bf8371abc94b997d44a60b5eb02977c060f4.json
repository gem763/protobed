Over the past two decades, however, October has been the second-best month of the year for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.\n\nThe S&P 500 entered the month up 19% for the year and just 1.6% below July 26's all-time closing high, helped by monetary easing by the Federal Reserve and signs of a resilient U.S. economy.\n\nThree events are likely to influence the market's fate this month. U.S. and Chinese officials are scheduled to meet in Washington for high-level trade talks; the coming earnings season is expected to show a third consecutive quarter of lower profits; and the U.K. faces an Oct. 31 deadline to pull itself out of the European Union.\n\nSome analysts say there isn't much room for stocks to run after September -- historically the weakest month for stocks -- bucked the trend. The S&P 500 ticked up 1.7% last month, and market moves were relatively muted. The index closed up or down more than 1% in only two of 20 trading sessions.\n\n\"What has us worried this October is the fact that September this year was historically calm,\" Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, said in a note. \"If we know one thing, it is that markets don't stay calm forever and after a dull market last month, we could be due for some usual October volatility.\"\n\nStocks came under pressure Tuesday to start the month after a report showed U.S. factory activity contracted in September for a second consecutive month. The S&P 500 and the Dow industrials dropped more than 1.2%, giving up their entire gains for the third quarter.\n\nInvestors will next look to Friday's closely watched jobs report for further clues about the health of the economy.\n\nStocks are historically more susceptible to a pullback in October in years such as 2019, when they have already made a big run. That is what happened last year, when the S&P 500 set a record in late September, only to fall nearly 20% over the next three months on worries about slowing growth.\n\nSince 1983, the index has declined 1.2% on average in October when it has climbed more than 10% in the first three quarters of the year, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nMeanwhile, in other years, when the benchmark has made smaller advances to start the year, it has risen 1.8% on average. And when the S&P has declined for the year through September, the index has risen 1.7% in October on average.\n\nSmall-cap stocks have been especially vulnerable in Octobers past. The Russell 2000 index has dropped 1.1% on average -- the worst performance of any month -- according to a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of data going back to 1987.\n\nShares in smaller U.S. companies, which are more tied to the domestic economy, have lagged behind their larger counterparts this year, with the Russell 2000 rising 13% through September. But recent optimism about lower interest rates and robust consumer-spending data have boosted sentiment on growth prospects for the economy.\n\nChris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, said his firm would maintain its year-end target for the S&P 500 at 3100 if there was neither a breakthrough deal nor a significant escalation in the tariff dispute. But a potential ratcheting up of trade tensions this quarter could threaten to send the index to 2400, or a roughly 20% drop from current levels, he said.\n\n\"Given all of the uncertainty, we have been taking a more cautious stance with our clients' money, retaining some cash in our portfolios, trying to focus on quality stocks over those with momentum and predominantly looking within select areas of the technology, health-care and consumer-discretionary sectors,\" Mr. Zaccarelli said in a note.\n\nTo receive our Markets newsletter every morning in your inbox, click here.\n\nWrite to Jessica Menton at Jessica.Menton@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 02, 2019 08:14 ET (12:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
