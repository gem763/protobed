A delighted Melly has shared the letter sent to Ben on her Twitter.\n\nCould someone from @Always tell me why it is imperative to have the female symbol on their sanitary products? There are non-binary and trans folks who still need to use your products too you know! #queerandhere pic.twitter.com/G6nzSmaW39 \u2014 Melly Boom \ud83d\udca5 (@MellyBoomBoom_) July 12, 2019\n\nThe letter read: \u2018We listened to you and our marketing team worked a solution. We are glad to inform you that as of December we will use a wrapper design without the feminine symbol.\u2019\n\nThe note, signed from the Always team, reminded Ben that they might come across old packaging after December as distribution sometimes takes a while.\n\nIt said that the new design should be available in stores early in the new year.\n\nOh really? \ud83d\ude0c Finally someone got through to them. It pays for the \u201cminority\u201d to be heard. pic.twitter.com/Zr0yvs7dGz \u2014 Melly Boom \ud83d\udca5 (@MellyBoomBoom_) October 16, 2019\n\nWhile the move was praised by Melly, others felt it was somewhat problematic of the brand. The decision has polarised social media users.\n\nOne person backed the move, saying: \u2018I understand that you guys love girl positivity but please understand that there are trans men that get periods, and if you could please do something about the symbol on your pad packaging, I\u2019d be happy. I\u2019d hate to have any trans males feel dysphoric.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut another user felt it was eliminating femaleness, saying: \u2018Why are corporates so willing to alienate their core demographic at the drop of a hat because a few people tell them that recognising female biology is \u2018exclusionary\u2019?\u2019\n\nIn the same vein, another wrote: \u2018I\u2019m so glad and thankful that people can be who they feel they are, but it feels like [cis] women are so offensive to people, being shunned and don\u2019t have rights!\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve contacted Ben, Melly and Always for comment and will update the article if they reply.\n\nMORE: Man gets shut down after rant branding periods \u2018disgusting\u2019 and women\u2019s \u2018fault\u2019\n\nMORE: University agrees to give out free sanitary products after student used own money to provide them\n\nMORE: Girls in primary school experience period poverty too \u2013 where are their free sanitary products?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Transgender campaigner Ben Saunders asked sanitary product brand Always why they include feminine logos in their packaging.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90836022_1571576471.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
