He also congratulated his political rival and invited him to the Casa Rosada presidential palace on Monday to discuss an orderly transition.\n\nFernandez and his running-mate, former populist leader Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, will be sworn in on December 10.\n\n\"We believe that the new president will seek to implement populist policies, due to his Peronist credentials and closeness to the Kirchners, so markets should brace for more volatility,\" Andres Abadia, senior international economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note published Monday.", "description": "The victory for Fernandez comes as the country is facing a debt crunch, after the worst rout of the country's stock market in decades.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106207159-1572265782792gettyimages-1178632099.jpeg?v=1572265843", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
