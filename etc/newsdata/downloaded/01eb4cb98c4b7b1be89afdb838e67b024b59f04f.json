Natasha Cloud finished with 18 points for Washington, and Kristi Toliver also had 18 points, 10 in the fourth quarter.\n\nWashington's veteran coach, Mike Thibault, who has the most regular-season wins in league history (336), captured his first WNBA title.\n\nConnecticut's Jonquel Jones played through foul trouble most of the game and finished with 25 points and nine rebounds. Alyssa Thomas had 21 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. She finished with a Finals-record 38 assists in the series. Courtney Williams finished with 16 points.\n\nThe game, which was tight until the final minutes, featured nine lead changes and 15 ties. The previous four games in the series had a total of 12 ties and six lead changes.\n\nA 13-2 run in the fourth quarter behind five points from Cloud and four by Delle Donne proved to be the difference with the Mystics taking an 80-72 lead with 2:54 left in regulation.\n\nDelle Donne, a 6-foot-5 forward who averaged 21.4 points in Washington's first five playoff games, left the Game 2 loss to Connecticut early in the first quarter without scoring a point. She put up 13 points in a Game 3 win and 11 in a Game 4 loss on Tuesday.\n\nConnecticut scored eight unanswered points to take a 53-44 lead -- its biggest advantage in the game -- with 6:39 left in the third quarter. Jones made a cutting layup to cap that sequence, but she committed her fourth foul on Washington's next possession that ended with Delle Donne converting a three-point play to cut the deficit to 53-47.\n\nWith Jones on the bench, Washington rallied with four more points by Meesseman to pull within 53-51. Meesseman had 11 points in the quarter, helping the Mystics tie the game twice with Jones still out. Connecticut led 64-62 going tin the fourth quarter.\n\nJones was back on the floor to start the fourth quarter when Cloud made a 3-pointer and Delle Donne converted a layup to put Washington ahead 67-64 with 8:57 left.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "League MVP Elena Delle Donne, playing with a herniated disk, led the Mystics  to their first championship, producing 21 points and nine rebounds in ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
