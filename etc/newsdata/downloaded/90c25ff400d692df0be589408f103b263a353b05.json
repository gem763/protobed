It's a costume, just like how any other person would dress up if they were portraying a famous character. In this case, it's Mel B.\"\n\nIn a separate comment, she wrote, \"I think you don't understand the context of 'black face'. A lot of women have afros, it doesn't specifically belong to one ethnicity.\"\n\nShe soon took to Twitter to apologise for her words, saying that she should be careful about what she said when it comes to such a sensitive topic.\n\n\"[From] now on I will try to be more educated about matters like this to make sure I don't make careless mistakes like this again in the future,\" she tweeted.\n\nThe actress added that cultural appropriation is an issue that is deep rooted in society, and something that she still has a lot to learn.\n\n\"I've read your comments and tweets and I honestly do understand where this backlash has come from,\" she added.\n\n(Photo Source: Liza Soberano Instagram)", "description": "The actress says that she is still educating herself on the topic of cultural appropriation", "authors": ["Heidi Hsia"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e7xOm8IvimOMuN5XnzNXvQ--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_hive_asia_947/4cf9ecb7a156000e9671c47dd8d9787a", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
