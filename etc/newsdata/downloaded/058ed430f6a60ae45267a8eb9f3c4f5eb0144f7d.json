The truth was that Cain didn\u2019t even know he had this secret son thanks to the interference of Faith (Sally Dexter), who got in the way of Cara\u2019s communicate with him.\n\nThis has led to Cain turning his back on Faith, who has been forced to leave the village in disgrace. Cain also wants nothing more to do with Moira, who gave into Nate\u2019s seduction and tonight admits to Victoria (Isabel Hodgins) that she had no idea what she was thinking. Same, hon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the marriage in tatters, his relationship with his mum fractured and the revelation that he has a son, things couldn\u2019t be much worse for Cain. But he isn\u2019t the only one left seething by the betrayal as Nate was initially conducting his pursuit of Moira while he was with Amy.\n\nAnd it seems that the only reason he was dating Amy was to try and persuade her to fight Cain for custody of Kyle, another way to hurt the village hard man. Kerry discovered the truth about Nate and Moira\u2019s affair but was persuaded to keep quiet as she herself was hiding the secret of the fire which killed Frank Clayton at the time.\n\nBut tonight, Nate makes it clear to Amy that her mum knew and didn\u2019t tell her, which leaves Amy aghast. With Nate having caused more damage, is another family set to be broken apart?\n\nWith Kerry set to hit the bottle in coming scenes, it seems another downfall is coming.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Monday 28th October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "He hasn't finished his stirring yet.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nate-Robinson-in-Emmerdale-5c6b_1572264384.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
