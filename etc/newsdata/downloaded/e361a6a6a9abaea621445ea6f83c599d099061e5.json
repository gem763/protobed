Officers, however, came prepared for a long and busy night as fans prepared to return to the city's all-night drinking venues after full-time.\n\nPolice staged a fearsome show of strength, at times outnumbering the largely well-behaved English fans, who congregated in two Irish bars on the edge of the cobblestoned Old Town.\n\nHowever, as tempers boiled over among a minority of fans at 7pm, a recorded warning was played in English before the Czech police advanced. Smoke grenades were fired by police as fans were forced back through a small archway as bottles continued to be thrown. About a dozen men were eventually forced into a corner and made to lie face down, while another was seen being pinned to the floor nearby as officers secured the scene.", "description": "Prague police staged a zero tolerance response to English troublemakers, with riot officers using smoke grenades after bottles were thrown between opposing supporters in the city's Old Town.", "authors": ["Tom Morgan", "Sports News Correspondent", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212754393-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwR9CmnucIcqQaI247kVHKfVSc7sVuZw6puPpK1VdXwk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
