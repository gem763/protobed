But the group behind the event said organizations attached to the GOP program were \u201cthreatened/harassed\u201d over their involvement, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.\n\nDEMS ADMIT TRUMP HELPED GOP CANDIDATES SWEEP NORTH CAROLINA SPECIAL ELECTIONS\n\n\u201cThat kind of bullying discourages citizens from participating in society,\" said Julie Byrne, vice-chair of the Warren County Republican Party. \"The people that engage in this behavior prevented fellow citizens from peacefully assembling and having a family event on a fall afternoon, and they should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nAccording to promotional material, three train rides were being offered throughout the day for up to 300 passengers per trip, with tickets ranging from $15 to $20 for children and $20 to $30 for adults. The event was also supposed to feature food trucks, souvenirs and entertainment.\n\nByrne did not give details of the threats, only saying that they referenced legal action and boycotts.\n\nWarren County Democratic Chair Bethe Goldenfield came out against such tactics, reportedly telling Warren County GOP Chair Jeff Monroe that her group had nothing to do with it. \u201c[W]e haven\u2019t made any threats,\u201d she told the Enquirer.\n\nMonroe condemned those who would threaten people or businesses based on their beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that politics has gotten to the point where people believe it\u2019s ok to harass businesses because of their customers\u2019 political viewpoints,\u201d he said.\n\nGoldenfield noted the train ride could have run into potential legal issues, anyway. The company that runs the railroad is operated by a nonprofit, which is prohibited from partisan political activity. While the event was not related to any particular political campaign, Goldenfield reportedly said she was going to contact the railroad about this, but the local Republican group canceled the event first.\n\n\u201cI don't consider that threatening,\" she argued. \"I'm doing my due diligence.\u201d\n\nFurther, the railroad company released a statement after the event was canceled, saying once they found out the ride was being called the \u201cTrump Train,\u201d they chose to \u201cdisassociate\u201d themselves from the event.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nByrne claimed that the ride would not have posed legal problems, as other nonprofits have rented space or facilities to political groups \u201cwithout jeopardizing their status.\u201d", "description": "A local Republican group in Ohio has\u00a0canceled a fundraiser featuring a ride on a train bearing President Trump's name after alleged threats from political opponents.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/trump-train-LMM-Railway.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
