REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo\n\nBoth companies said they remained in negotiations with Boeing Co (BA.N) over compensation for the 737 MAX grounding, now in its eighth month following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to ensure that Boeing shareholders bear the cost of Boeing\u2019s failures, not American Airlines\u2019 shareholders,\u201d American Chief Executive Doug Parker said on a conference call.\n\nAmerican shares rose 2% to $28.85 and Southwest shares were up 4.7% at $55.72.\n\nBoth airlines have been forced to cancel more than 100 daily flights into early next year as Boeing works on software and training updates to win regulatory approval for the planes to fly again.\n\nAmerican trimmed the top end of its adjusted 2019 forecast at $5.50 per share versus its previous forecast range of $4.50 to $6 per share and raised the estimated costs related to the MAX grounding to $540 million for the year.\n\nSouthwest did not provide a full-year profit forecast but said it took a $210-million hit to operating income in the quarter from the ongoing MAX safety ban.\n\nBut with slimmer fleets and fewer seats to sell, both airlines have been able to charge higher fares thanks to robust U.S. travel demand.\n\nClosely-watched revenues per available seat mile, or unit revenues, rose 4.2% in the quarter at Southwest, which primarily flies domestically, while total unit revenues at American, with a larger international presence, rose 2%.\n\nAmerican\u2019s net income rose to $425 million, or 96 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $372 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier, while total operating revenue rose 3% to $11.91 billion.\n\nAt Southwest, net income rose to $659 million, or $1.23 per share from $615 million, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier on a 1.1% rise in operating revenue to $5.64 billion.", "description": "American Airlines Group and Southwest Airlines posted quarterly profit rises on Thursday even as the two U.S. carriers pointed to rising impact from the continued grounding of Boeing 737 MAX.", "authors": ["Tracy Rucinski", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444483232&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0ZV", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
