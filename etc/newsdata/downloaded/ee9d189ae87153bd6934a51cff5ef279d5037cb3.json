Some 299 MPs voted in favour of a general election, while 70 voted against it \u2013 falling short of the \u201csuper majority\u201d needed.\n\nMr Johnson's election bid, which was made under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA), required a two-thirds Commons majority of 434 MPs to pass.\n\nThe division list showed 280 Tory MPs voted for the snap election motion along with 18 Independents and Labour MP Kate Hoey.\n\nThose who voted against the motion included 38 Labour MPs, four Independents, 18 Liberal Democrats, four Plaid Cymru, five Independent Group for Change and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas\n\nBoris Johnson speaks during the election debate on Monday (PA) More\n\nStraight after the defeat, Mr Johnson told MPs the Government will give notice of a short Bill for an election in December.\n\nHe said he would continue to press for a December 12 polling day - even though the Liberal Democrats and the SNP suggested at the weekend they could support a slightly earlier date of December 9.\n\nThe Prime Minister said: \u201cThe leader of the Opposition literally and figuratively has run away from the judgment of the people.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson continued: \u201cBut as I said when moving the motion, we will not allow this paralysis to continue, and one way or another we must proceed straight to an election.\n\n\u201cSo later on this evening, the Government will give notice of presentation for a short Bill for an election on December 12 so we can finally get Brexit done. This House cannot any longer keep this country hostage.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson concluded: \u201cNow that no deal is off the table, we have a great new deal, and it\u2019s time for the voters to have a chance to pronounce on that deal and to replace this dysfunctional Parliament with a new Parliament that can get Brexit done so the country can move on.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson will today try one more time to force a general election before Christmas despite his bid being rejected in the Commons three times already.The Prime Minister is to abandon his attempts to push his Brexit bill through Parliament in a move aimed at securing the support of the Liberal Democrats", "authors": ["Sean Morrison"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Kqx.t7tv6QkfF24SR72vgQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/6b9f444bc0d83f2c00c7c3d2cac88185", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
