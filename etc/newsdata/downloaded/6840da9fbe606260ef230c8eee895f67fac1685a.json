The killers entered a South African game reserve undetected, prompting concerns about an \u2018inside job.\u2019\n\nThe Head Ranger at the Rietvlei Nature Reserve in Pretoria, South Africa, Bradden Stevens, 33, who spent a third of his life caring for the lions, made the grim and grisly discovery last Thursday.\n\n\u201cJarvis, Bashi, Tawana and Tau were brutally murdered, in what seems to be a muti [black magic] killing,\u201d Stevens wrote, in a heartfelt Facebook post. \u201cThese last few days have been the darkest I have ever experienced.\u201d\n\nAccording to an autopsy report, the lions were poisoned by poachers who, once the great felines had succumbed to an excruciating death, cut off their paws and jaws for use in black magic. Two other females from the pride, named River and Serabi, were fatally poisoned in 2017, but in that instance the poachers were discovered before they could mutilate the corpses.\n\nAlso on rt.com Lions \u2018devour\u2019 poacher after he is trampled to death by an elephant in Kruger National Park\n\nThe armed gang seemingly had intimate knowledge of both the game reserve and its security operations, as they evaded park rangers and had enough time to poison the lions with tainted meat in their 250-hectare area at the centre of the reserve, before butchering them on-site and making good their escape.\n\nThe Rietvlei Nature Reserve is also home to healthy populations of rhino, leopard, buffalo and, up until last week, a pride of lions. There are now growing concerns about the safety of the other animals living within the park.\n\n\u201cThis horrific crime will not go unpunished,\u201d the South African Police Service said.\n\nMuti is a witchcraft potion made by healers to cast a variety of spells, from protection to virility to cures for illness and strength potions.\n\nSecurity in the area has been heightened following the brutal slayings, with additional police patrols searching for the perpetrators as they attempt to smuggle the parts out of the region; but it is likely already too late.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
