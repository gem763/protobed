This year, we\u2019re expecting an \u201ciPhone 11,\u201d an \u201ciPhone 11 Pro,\u201d and an \u201ciPhone 11 Pro Max.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 11 is said to be the cheapest option; it\u2019s rumored to be the successor to last year\u2019s iPhone XR, which started at $750.\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s what Business Insider readers have to say about the iPhone 11, Apple\u2019s next smartphone expected to arrive in September\n\nThe two Pro models, on the other hand, would be the follow-ups to last year\u2019s iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, which started at $1,000 and $1,100.\n\nBased on what we know, though, it sounds as if the smaller iPhone 11 Pro and not the standard iPhone 11 will be the best option for most people.\n\nOf the three new iPhones, the iPhone 11 Pro looks to be the ideal size.\n\ncaption From left: iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, 11, XS, XS Max, XR. source YouTube/Dave Lee\n\nIn the image above, you\u2019re looking at machine-milled dummy models of the iPhone 11 on the left, and the 2018 iPhone lineup on the right. The new iPhones are expected to be the same size as last year\u2019s phones.\n\nBased on what we know, the iPhone 11 Pro would have the smallest display: It\u2019s said to have a 5.8-inch screen, like the iPhone XS.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 11 would have a larger 6.1-inch display (just like the iPhone XR), and the iPhone 11 Pro Max would have a giant 6.5-inch screen like the iPhone XS Max.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s spent extensive time with the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, I found the 5.8-inch display to be the best fit for me. I\u2019d say I have average-sized hands, and that phone just feels perfect to me. The 6.1-inch iPhone XR is pretty close, but I prefer the compact nature of the iPhone XS, and that design should carry forward in the standard iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nThe baseline iPhone 11 Pro is expected to be the entry point for Apple\u2019s new camera tech.\n\nAll the new iPhones are said to have new cameras \u2013 but only the two Pro models are rumored to feature a third rear camera lens, for a super-wide-angle camera.\n\nBy all accounts, if you\u2019re going to buy any of the new iPhones, you\u2019re going to want that special three-lens camera system.\n\nAsk any person who owns a smartphone with a wide-angle lens, and they\u2019ll tell you that feature is essential. It lets you capture more details in your photos, and it means you don\u2019t have to back up several dozen feet to capture everyone in a group photo. It gives photos a cinematic feel as well.\n\nSince the standard iPhone 11 isn\u2019t said to come with this feature, getting the baseline Pro model means you\u2019d be buying into Apple\u2019s latest tech \u2013 without having to spend an extra $100 for the Max version.\n\nIf Apple has any other features exclusive to the Pro models, the iPhone 11 Pro would be the cheapest way to experience them.\n\nsource YouTube/Unbox Therapy\n\nBy all accounts, the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max are said to have identical features. The only differences should be the screen size and battery capacity. (The larger phone would have more of both.)\n\nIf Apple has any other new features that help differentiate the standard iPhone 11 from the Pro models, aside from the rear cameras, the 5.8-inch Pro would be the cheapest way to experience that newness.\n\nWhich new iPhone would you want to buy?\n\nsource YouTube/Unbox Therapy\n\nAre you looking forward to the next iPhones? If you are thinking of buying one, which model looks most appealing to you?
