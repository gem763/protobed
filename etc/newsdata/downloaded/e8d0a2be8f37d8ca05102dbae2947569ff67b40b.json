Among those measures, Steyer supports overturning the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling, calling national referendums on issues related to gun safety, restructuring the Federal Election Commission, and expanding voter registration and voting access.\n\nHow much would it cost?\n\nSteyer\u2019s plan includes no final price tag for taxpayers, but does call for increased levels of government spending across several agencies.\n\nSteyer says he will \u201cinvest in wraparound services that address the full spectrum of challenges faced by gun violence survivors \u2026 through targeted programs on mental health treatment, trauma care, drug treatment, voluntary self-prohibition, and mentoring.\u201d\n\nSome of the programs Steyer wants to \u201cdirectly fund\u201d include law enforcement training efforts and gun violence research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nHow would he pay for it?\n\nThough it\u2019s not immediately clear how Steyer would finance his reforms, he suggests that at least some of the initiatives would pay for themselves. His plan claims that \u201cgun violence costs each American roughly $700 a year, totaling $229 billion across the country.\u201d\n\nWhat have other Democrats proposed?\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates have rolled out their own comprehensive gun reform plans in recent months. All of the party\u2019s White House contenders favor universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s support for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s endorsement of a gun licensing program are among the proposals that have received significant media attention in the primary.\n\nWho opposes it?\n\nSteyer\u2019s plan is likely to meet stiff opposition from the National Rifle Association, lobbyists representing gun manufacturers and congressional Republicans.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/94/d2/15902ed246e082bd8faf5840b35f/191001-tom-steyer-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
