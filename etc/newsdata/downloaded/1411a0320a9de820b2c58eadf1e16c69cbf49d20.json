He said it was because he injured his quadriceps in the first game.\n\nYes, in case you were wondering, by that time he'd been booed upon entering the court, and cheers came when he hit double faults, although the atmosphere wasn't as charged as in Medvedev's previous two rounds. A largely muted Medvedev contributed to that.\n\nMedvedev grabbed an early break advantage against Wawrinka before the trainer's visit ahead of the eighth game.\n\nOn the next changeover, at 5-4, the tape came off.\n\nBroken at 5-5, it felt like Medvedev would pull the plug at any moment, especially if he ended up dropping the set.\n\nJUST WATCHED Roger Federer remembers this 'extraordinary' kiss Replay More Videos ...

Reeling, Wawrinka was broken early in the second to trail 3-1 and Medvedev had a spring in his step.\n\nHitting drop shots in the first set at times to shorten rallies -- Medvedev possesses great touch, combined with power -- they largely went away in set two.\n\nMedvedev suffered a letdown to start the third, falling behind 3-0, yet Wawrinka almost let him off the hook at 5-3.\n\nJUST WATCHED One-on-one with Stan Wawrinka (2016) Replay More Videos ...

It was to Medvedev, for 2-0.\n\nIn the next game, he flashed defense that would make Rafael Nadal proud, striking a squash-like forehand on break point to force a Wawrinka volley error.\n\nThat was Wawrinka's last realistic chance.\n\n\"I didn't start well,\" Wawrinka said. \"I never really find the right rhythm. I wanted to find between staying back and being offensive. Didn't serve so well.\n\n\"He was playing well. He was there when he need it, and he was the better player today.\"\n\n'I felt the way I won was quite ugly'\n\nMedvedev then barely celebrated upon winning -- forget the dance -- and said he would try his best to be 100% for the semifinals.\n\n\"I felt the way I won was quite ugly, because that's what I had to do,\" Medvedev said.\n\n\"I am still really painful in my leg. I knew I have to play without rhythm. Some games I have to not run to relax my leg. I was hitting full power, then suddenly I was doing dropshots in the middle.\n\n\"I knew I should not give him any rhythm. In crucial moments maybe it will make him miss. That's what has worked.\n\n\"Of course, I would prefer to win in a normal way with a normal tennis game, but that's how I won. Hopefully physically I will feel better normally, yes.\"\n\nHaving two days off, instead of the usual one, could make all the difference.\n\n\"I'm feeling really lucky about it because I didn't know this before the match or during the match,\" Medvedev said about the amount of time he gets to recover. \"As soon as I went out of the court, somebody told me that, now you have two days. I was like, 'Really?'\n\n\"I didn't know. I thought it was going to be normal, one day off, you go to play. That's huge advantage regarding what happened to my leg. I think, as I say, I don't want to say anything yet, but I think it should be OK.\"\n\nHe finally drew some applause from the fans when it ended for his impressive display, but it will be hard to come by if he indeed meets Federer on Friday.\n\nWhen asked if feels like he is friends again with the fans in New York, the Russian responded, \"Hopefully. It's not for me to decide. As I said in the post match, even after the previous round, what I got I deserved. Usually I'm not like this, as I was in the third round match. I'm not proud of it. I'm working to be better.\n\n\"Hopefully I can show the bright side of myself.\"\n\nWawrinka doesn't think Medvedev will win US Open\n\nWawrinka was asked if Medvedev could win the US Open.\n\n\"He can, but I don't think he will,\" the 2016 champion said. \"I think it's going to be really difficult. But that's just my opinion.\"\n\nAs to why?\n\n\"Because he looks to start to be tired, and he has to beat some more tougher player in the semifinal, Roger or Grigor, and then in the final,\" Wawrinka said. \"But again, he's showing last few weeks that anything can happen with him, so for sure he's going to have a shot. He just need two more matches.", "description": "One of the most popular players tennis has ever seen -- if not at the top of the list -- facing the current villain.
