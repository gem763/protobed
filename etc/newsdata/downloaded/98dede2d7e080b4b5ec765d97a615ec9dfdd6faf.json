In return it would pay less per share, giving it a larger stake in WeWork, the Financial Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter.\n\nWeWork shelved its IPO this month after investors balked at its business model, mounting losses, and controversial CEO and cofounder Adam Neumann. The lack of interest meant it was looking at a public valuation below $20 billion \u2013 well short of its last private valuation of $47 billion. It also risked raising less than $3 billion, the amount needed to unlock $6 billion in bank loans.\n\nAnother $1 billion from SoftBank could open up fresh financing options for WeWork, the Financial Times said. The company is scrambling to secure funds given it might not complete an IPO this year \u2013 a condition of the bank financing. Without the $6 billion in bank loans, and assuming it maintains its previous cash-burn rate, it could run out of cash in just 13 months, FT Alphaville estimated.\n\nGiven its uncertain financial position, WeWork may be looking to cut costs.\n\nNew co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, who took the reins from Neumann this week, have considered firing thousands of WeWork\u2019s 12,500 employees, the Financial Times reported. They\u2019ve also explored shutting peripheral businesses such as Managed by Q, an office maintenance platform, the newspaper said.", "description": "Business Insider - The shared workspace group's new co-CEOs have also considered firing thousands of its 12,500 employees, the Financial Times reported..
