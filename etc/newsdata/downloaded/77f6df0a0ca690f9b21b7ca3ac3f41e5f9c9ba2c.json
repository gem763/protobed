The good news is we\u2019re completely debt-free, and we have a six-month emergency fund saved up. I work part-time, since we have young children, and I\u2019ve been bringing home about $800 a month. Should we cut our budget down to bare bones now, or do you think we could continue living as usual for the time being since we have so much money saved?\n\nJayme\n\nDear Jayme,\n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear about your husband losing his job. At the same time, I\u2019m really proud of you two for saving and preparing yourselves financially for this kind of scenario. Eight hundred dollars a month isn\u2019t bad for a part-time job, but it\u2019s not nearly enough to run a household\u2014even one that\u2019s debt-free\u2014when there are kids in the picture.\n\nYou should already be living on a little as possible in order to make the money in your emergency fund last as long as it can. It\u2019s beans and rice time in your house. That means no restaurants, no vacations, and no movies. In other words, no spending on anything but bare necessities until your husband finds another good job, and you guys are back on your financial feet again. Right now, your priorities are keeping the lights on, the water running, and making sure there\u2019s food in the pantry.\n\nThis is a textbook definition of an emergency, Jayme. Use your emergency fund. It\u2019s there for times just like these. But be wise, and spend as little as humanly possible. God bless you all!\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,My husband lost his job last week.
