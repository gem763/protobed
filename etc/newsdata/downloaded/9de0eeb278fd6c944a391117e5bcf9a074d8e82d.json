By the time they were teenagers, Castillo and Castillo Pereyra were playing shows across Nebraska.\n\nThey formed the mariachi group \u201cKarlysue y Trio Los Charros\u201d in 2016. Castillo Pereyra sings and plays the violin, while her brother plays the violin and trumpet. Two other band members, Arturo Feuntes and Castillo Pereyra\u2019s husband, Sam Pereyra, play the guitarron and the vihuela, a small guitar-like mariachi instrument.\n\nCastillo Pereyra met her husband at BYU when he performed with a different mariachi group.\n\nMariachi music is experiencing a rebirth in the U.S. Southwest as a form of storytelling and a strong symbol of Mexican culture after emerging in the U.S. by the 1950s due to its popularity in films.\n\nEsperanza Elementary School in West Valley City features Utah\u2019s largest mariachi music program.\n\n\u201cWhen I came here 42 years ago from Mexico, there was nothing,\u201d said Eulogio Alejandre, the school\u2019s principal. \u201cThere was nothing that would remind us of the culture of Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe music has become increasingly popular and strengthened students\u2019 family life, he added.\n\n\u201cAll kinds of people are gravitating to mariachi music, because it really is a cultural phenomenon from Mexico, and it reminds people in the U.S. of their roots,\u201d Alejandre said.\n\nThe group recently wrapped up their busy summer season, when they play a lot of weddings, festivals, quinceaneras, corporate parties and BYU events.\n\nCastillo Pereyra said the music is empowering and increasingly popular with non-Latino audiences. It\u2019s common to all-female or all-male mariachi groups, but mixed-gender groups like theirs are rare, she said.\n\n\u201cBeing a woman, sometimes I don\u2019t even think about the fact that it\u2019s out of the ordinary that a woman is leading the group,\u201d Castillo Pereyra said.\n\nSam Castillo said many people don\u2019t realize how diverse mariachi music can be, evoking love, happiness, vulnerability, grief or longing.\n\nWhile Castillo is busy studying neuroscience and psychology at BYU and Castillo Pereyra is occupied with raising a family, both siblings said they would never stop playing mariachi music.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to have that job that they love going to and for us, that\u2019s what mariachi is,\u201d Castillo Pereyra said. \u201cIt feels really good that we\u2019re doing something with our culture.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two Utah siblings have continued their family's tradition of playing mariachi music by performing the energetic, Mexican music at events throughout the state.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/siblings_mariachi_group_94450_c0-752-1537-1648_s1200x700.jpg?216223e6a65ab790d46d8a8cb0971d00cfdbf795", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
