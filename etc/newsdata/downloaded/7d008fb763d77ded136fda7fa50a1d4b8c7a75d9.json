The Chinese government said to \u2018stay tuned\u2019 as it was preparing its retaliation against the US.\n\nAt the start of the week, Beijing made it clear they won\u2019t be compromising on industrial policy or government subsidies. Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier, will be leading the next round of trade discussions, but he will not carry the \u2018special envoy\u2019 title. The US government has put visa restrictions on Chinese officials as a response to China\u2019s treatment of the Muslim community in Xinjiang. Beijing called on the US to keep out of Chinese internal affairs, which put pressure on stocks in Asia. When you add that to the mix, you can see why traders aren\u2019t overly optimistic for the trade talks that will take place tomorrow. Its\u2019s not a great sign that tensions are already creeping up in advance of the negotiations, but at least they are going ahead.\n\nContinuing the theme of tough talks, the UK-EU relationship took a bit of a knock yesterday as Chancellor Merkel said that a deal is \u2018overwhelmingly unlikely\u2019. From the British side, Mr Johnson said an agreement is \u2018essentially impossible\u2019 to obtain, which added negative to the sentiment surrounding sterling. Despite the fragile talks, Ireland\u2019s Simon Coveney, reiterated the view that Dublin and Brussels are working hard to get a deal, but it can\u2019t be struck at any cost.\n\nJerome Powell said the Fed will start expanding its balance sheet soon in a bid to improve lending conditions. The central banker made it clear that \u2018this is not QE\u2019, it is about liquidity. As far as interest rates go, the US central bank is still data dependent.\n\nLast week there were concerns about the health of the global economy, so yesterday\u2019s mixed economic data didn\u2019t do much to dispel those worries. German industrial orders increased by 0.3% on a monthly basis, which was much better than the 0.1% decline that traders were expecting. The July report was revised from -0.6% to -0.4%, which is a positive step too. The figures were promising, but major concerns about the German economy still exist.\n\nIn the US, headline dropped to 1.4% from 1.8%, while the core reading declined from 2.3% to 2%. The is deemed to be a better gauge of underlying demand, so it is obvious it\u2019s falling. If demand at the factory level is dwindling, it could be a sign that CPI will slide too, which could increase chatter the Fed should lower rates.\n\nAt 3pm (UK time) the US update will be released, and economists are expecting 7.19 million, which would be a slight drop from the 7.21 million in July.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration update is expected to show that US increased by 2.6 million barrels, while gasoline stockpiles are tipped to fall by 263,000 barrels.\n\n\u2013 remains in the wider bearish trend, and if the negative move continues it might target 1.0800. A snap back might encounter resistance in the 1.1100 area.\n\n\u2013 has been pushing lower for over two weeks, and if it holds below the 50-day moving average at 1.2254 could pave the way for 1.2000 to be retested. A move to the upside side might bring 1.2400 into play.\n\n\u2013 while it holds above the 200-day moving average at 0.8832 the outlook should remain bullish, and 0.9100 might act as resistance. A break below 0.8786, might put 0.8724 on the radar.\n\n\u2013 since mid-September it has turned lower, and a break below 106.48 could pave the way for 106.00 to be retested. 108.47 might act as resistance to a positive move.\n\nis expected to open 19 points higher at 7,162\n\nis expected to open 26 points higher at 11,996\n\nis expected to open 16 points higher at 5,472\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution only provider.
