The resolution published today by the House Rules Committee, which customarily gives legislation the final imprimatur before it heads to a floor vote, is intended to address those charges.\n\nA vote on the impeachment resolution will take place on Thursday, and is expected to pass, since the House is controlled by Democrats.\n\n\u201c[T]he next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the President\u2019s misconduct,\u201d several leading Democrats said in a statement.\n\nThe resolution maintains the position of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., as the leader of the impeachment effort, even as it recognizes \u201congoing investigations\u201d by other House committees.\n\nImpeachment proceedings customarily have run through the House Judiciary Committee. Pelosi aides insist that Schiff\u2019s leadership of the impeachment inquiry stems from the fact that national security \u2014 the subject of Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine \u2014 is squarely within his jurisdiction.\n\nMoreover, the resolution does say that House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., will \u201cconduct proceedings to the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nJudiciary will also handle whatever articles of impeachment the House settles on, and will be the venue in which Trump\u2019s lawyers will have the ability to \u201cPresent their case and respond to evidence; Submit written requests for additional testimony or other evidence; Attend hearings, including those held in executive session; Raise an objection to testimony given; and Cross-examine witnesses,\u201d according to a fact sheet sent out by Democrats.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.

Questioning of witnesses, to be led by staff attorneys, will be confined to 45 minutes per side.\n\nRepublicans will have the opportunity to request witnesses of their own, although they will have to provide \u201cdetailed written justification of the relevance of the testimony of each requested witness to the investigation.\u201d Democrats on the committee will have the power to approve or block witnesses requested by Republicans.\n\nThe president\u2019s attorneys will also have the chance to participate in the impeachment proceedings, though only in the House Judiciary Committee, not in the House Intelligence Committee. As on Intelligence, Democrats on Judiciary will have to approve witnesses requested by Trump\u2019s attorneys.\n\nDemocrats indicated that their willingness to approve requests by Trump\u2019s attorneys to call witnesses will be dictated in part by whether the White House cooperates more fully than it has to date with the House impeachment inquiry, in the text of a copy of the procedural rules for the Judiciary Committee process obtained exclusively by Yahoo News. The Trump administration has thumbed its nose at Democrats and their investigation, blocking witnesses from testifying, refusing to hand over documents, and sending a letter to Pelosi dismissing the entire process.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould the President unlawfully refuse to make witnesses available for testimony to, or to produce documents requested by, the investigative committees ... the chair [of the Judiciary Committee] shall have the discretion to impose appropriate remedies, including by denying specific requests by the President or his counsel under these procedures to call or question witnesses,\u201d the rules document obtained by Yahoo News says.\n\n\n\nThe document also authorizes \u201ca concluding presentation from the President\u2019s counsel and Committee counsel for the majority and minority.\u201d", "description": "House Democrats have released a resolution that calls for \u201copen and investigative proceedings\u201d in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump for his alleged political interference in foreign aid to Ukraine.", "authors": ["Alexander Narzayan", "Jon Ward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ekz1k8hQqM21JqeN3CkBRw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cbc04d50-fa86-11e9-bcdf-0aa6938f3721", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
