It\u2019s serious for all Australians, not just for media, but it\u2019s our job to actually serve our communities,\u201d News Corp Australasia executive chairman Michael Miller said.\n\n\u201cWhen you see every media organisation lining up together to make this point, we need to see some action.\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nThe slide into secrecy must stop\n\nAustralians fear laws denying them basic information\n\nYour Right To Know Campaign All of us should be suspicious when the government is introducing laws that mean we don't know what's going on.\n\nThe six Australia\u2019s Right to Know reforms being sought are:\n\nthe right to contest any kind of search warrant on journalists or news organisations before the warrant is issued;\n\nlaw change to ensure public sector whistleblowers are adequately protected;\n\na new regime that limits which documents can be marked \u2018secret\u2019;\n\nreview of Freedom of Information laws\n\nthat journalists be exempt from national security laws enacted over the past seven years that currently can put them in jail for doing their job; and\n\nreform to defamation laws.\n\nmedia_camera Press Freedom: On the Line.

Picture: Gary Ramage\n\n\u201cAustralia is at risk of becoming the world\u2019s most secretive democracy,\u201d ABC\u2019s Managing Director, David Anderson, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the public\u2019s right to know slowly erode over the past two decades, with the introduction of laws that make it more difficult for people to speak up when they see wrongdoing and for journalists to report these stories.\u201d\n\nNine Entertainment\u2019s CEO Hugh Marks said the issue was not just about raids on media organisations.\n\n\u201cThis is much bigger than the media. It\u2019s about defending the basic right of every Australian to be properly informed about the important decisions the government is making in their name,\u201d he said.\n\nOriginally published as When government keeps the truth from you, what are they covering up?", "description": "In an unprecedented move, newspapers across the country are running covers featuring blacked-out stories today \u2014 and there is a compelling reason why.
