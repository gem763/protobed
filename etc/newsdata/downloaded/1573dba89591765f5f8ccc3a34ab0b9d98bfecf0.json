In one case, a woman who was raped by a member of parliamentary staff \u2014 who has since left the job \u2014 told POLITICO she was actively discouraged from going to the police and described the work environment in Parliament as a \u201cculture of silence.\u201d\n\nFrustrated that Parliament hasn\u2019t done more to sanction harassment, a group of political advisers last year set up the \"MeTooEP\" campaign to catalog stories of inappropriate behavior by MEPs and other officials. They\u2019re also calling on Parliament to introduce mandatory awareness-raising training for MEPs.\n\nMeanwhile, the controversies that do catch the public eye tend not to involve overt sexual harassment, but more insidious \u2014 and honestly bizarre \u2014 behavior.\n\nSetting a bad example:\n\nMaria Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues: In April, the Parliament found the prominent Portuguese MEP guilty of \u201cpsychological harassment\u201d toward her accredited assistant, causing her to be dropped from her party\u2019s electoral list. There were nine separate allegations against Rodrigues \u2014 a former government minister \u2014 including attempts to reduce the working hours and salary of a staff member returning from maternity leave, asking an employee on sick leave to carry out late-night tasks and demanding staff work well beyond normal office hours.\n\nRobert Rochefort: The 63-year-old French MEP was caught masturbating in front of two teenage girls in a hardware store outside of Paris in 2016. Rochefort told police he was \"under stress\" and complained that he felt threatened when a witness tackled him to the ground. Rochefort pled and was found guilty of the crime, escaping a public trial. Public prosecutors chose not to disclose his sentence. Rochefort lost his position within France\u2019s centrist MoDem party but served out his MEP term before retiring ahead of the May election.\n\nJ\u00f8rn Dohrmann: The far-right Danish People\u2019s Party MEP lost his immunity in the European Parliament after he allegedly manhandled TV journalist Birger Lund, who was taking photos near Dohrmann\u2019s house, in 2017. Lund needed help from the police to reclaim his camera, which was broken when it was returned to him.\n\nElmar Brok: With 39 years in the Parliament under his belt, the influential German official was the longest-serving MEP by the time he decided not to run for reelection this year. He was also one of the most complained about. Six former staffers told POLITICO of a slew of bizarre incidents, including his habit of throwing objects at them and smoking in the office. Asked about the allegations, Brok denied creating a toxic office environment, admitting only that \u201cworking closely together and having stressful days means that there is room for friction,\u201d adding \u201cI entirely condemn any kind of physical or emotional abuse.\u201d\n\nFollow the money\n\nThe biggest MEP controversies have involved the police and jail terms. Former Austrian MEP Ernst Strasser was jailed for three years in 2013, after a court found he offered to change laws in the European Parliament on behalf of a business that was willing to pay him \u20ac100,000 per year.\n\nThe jewel in the Parliament scandal crown, however, is a 1999 campaign that forced the entire European College of Commissioners to resign en masse over the corrupt practices of then European Commissioner for Research and Education Edith Cresson, a former French prime minister accused of embezzling funds for personal gain, among a slew of other misdeeds.\n\nMore recently, scandals involving misuse of funds and dodgy conflicts of interest have caused a stir in the bubble, but have led to less severe sanctions.\n\nSetting a bad example\n\nThe Le Pens: If fake jobs and the misuse of EU funds are now synonymous with France\u2019s far-right National Rally party, that\u2019s in large part thanks to its founding family\u2019s antics in the European Parliament. In May, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that party chief Marine Le Pen should pay back almost \u20ac300,000 in misused funds, including money she used to pay her chief of staff Catherine Griset a Parliament assistant\u2019s salary, despite the fact she didn\u2019t work in the plenary. Le Pen also paid her bodyguard Thierry L\u00e9gier as an EU parliamentary assistant and was forced to pay back more than \u20ac41,000 for that offense. Last year, her father \u2014 the party\u2019s founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2014 was ordered to pay back more than \u20ac320,000 for compensating an assistant for work he could not prove was related to his role as an MEP. National Rally colleague Myl\u00e8ne Troszczynski was also ordered, in a related case, to return more than \u20ac56,000.\n\nThe double-dippers: Six MEPs in the last Parliament earned at least double their yearly salary via side jobs outside Parliament. The best-paid MEP was online poker king Antanas Guoga, who raked in more than \u20ac3 million in additional income last year from 17 side gigs, according to Transparency International EU. Longtime Liberal party leader Guy Verhofstadt and Nigel Farage, the former head of UKIP now at the helm of the Brexit Party, each earned \u20ac420,000 in side income last year. Farage also allegedly failed to report gifts worth \u00a3450,000 from Brexit campaigner and businessman Arron Banks. He rejected a summons to appear in Brussels to testify on the allegations in June.\n\nElmar Brok (again): According to documents obtained by POLITICO earlier this year, Brok collected payments from visitor groups to his office in Brussels and skimmed off at least \u20ac18,000 for himself. Brok has also faced scrutiny over other financial arrangements. For years, he held a position with German media giant Bertelsmann that brought in more than \u20ac5,000 per month on top of his monthly MEP\u2019s salary.\n\nMorten Messerschmidt: His multiple money scandals came as a quite a shock to the Danes. In the 2014 European election, Messerschmidt received more personal votes than any other Danish candidate, largely on the back of a campaign in which he promised to combat EU fraud. Two years later, the Parliament ordered Messerschmidt to pay back about \u20ac400,000 in EU funds that he had spent on political campaigning. His pan-European party, the Movement for a Europe of Liberties and Democracy (MELD), collapsed after its funding was withdrawn. Messerschmidt is also under investigation by the EU anti-fraud agency (OLAF) for allegedly using \u20ac26,000 in EU funds on Danish People\u2019s Party summer camps in 2014 and 2015.\n\nMarkus Ferber: The Bavarian MEP promoted a financial services product targeting legislation that he helped push through Parliament.\n\nIn a 2017 letter to financial industry executives, Ferber wrote that the product, TIPER, \u201chelps [in] satisfying a range of key requirements in MiFID II,\u201d the updated Markets in Financial Instruments Directive that came into effect in 2018 and for which Ferber served as the European Parliament\u2019s point man. TIPER is offered through a foundation Ferber co-founded with the CEO of the company that produces it. Ferber says he has \u201cno financial interests\u201d in the product he was pitching, but admitted he erred in not declaring his affiliation to Parliament. Ferber hasn\u2019t faced any sanctions for his efforts.\n\nFar-right fails\n\nEurope\u2019s far-right parties seem to have a knack for causing mischief in the Parliament.\n\nIn the week before the European Parliament election, the Swedish far-right party axed one of its MEPs \u2014 Kristina Winberg \u2014 after she accused a colleague of sexual harassment. Meanwhile, Heinz-Christian Strache \u2014 just days after being sacked as Austria\u2019s interior minister for discussing a potential cash-for-influence deal with an alleged Russian oligarch caught on tape \u2014 rode a far-right backlash against the decision to win a seat as an MEP. Outraged supporters used a quirk in Austria\u2019s electoral system to include Strache\u2019s name on ballot papers, catapulting him to the top of his party\u2019s list.\n\nThere are plenty more instances of far-right rule-bending.\n\nSetting a bad example\n\nB\u00e9la Kov\u00e1cs: The Hungarian MEP, a member of the far-right Jobbik party, lost his parliamentary immunity in 2015 after he was accused of spying on EU institutions for Russia. The incredible tale involved secret marriages, multiple identities and untraceable fortunes. Andr\u00e1s Desz\u00f3, the journalist who first reported the news that Kov\u00e1cs was recruited by the KGB, was nominated for the European Press Prize. To some extent, Kov\u00e1cs was hiding in plain sight: Among colleagues, he was known by the nickname \u201cKGB\u00e9la,\u201d and he was married to a Russian.\n\nBeatrix von Storch: The granddaughter of Adolf Hitler\u2019s finance minister, now deputy leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, advocated shooting immigrants \u2014 including children \u2014 who tried to enter Europe without a visa. (She later watered down the remarks.) Von Storch was thrown out of the European Conservative and Reformists group for her extreme views in 2016.\n\nJanusz Korwin-Mikke: The Polish far-right MEP was twice penalized by the European Parliament for off-color remarks: once in June 2016, when he made derogatory comments about migrants during a plenary session, and again in March 2017, when he claimed women should earn less money than men \u201cbecause they are weaker, they are smaller [and] they are less intelligent\u201d during a debate on the wage gap. An EU court later annulled the penalties imposed on him, finding that his statements did not fundamentally undermine Parliament\u2019s ability to function.
