The stadium\u2019s center-field video screen was visible through an opening between buildings and the grates of a fence and she could see a whirl of Nationals highlights and the players being introduced.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was going to go to MGM [casino] but this is better,\u201d said Chase, a former James Creek resident who was visiting her cousin. \u201cI\u2019m going to sit here and enjoy the game. Best seat in the house.\u201d\n\nRene Hawkins, 37, a James Creek resident, said she sometimes mistakes the fireworks for gunshots, which are also an occasional part of the neighborhood\u2019s soundtrack. In recent weeks, in separate incidents, a 15-year-old boy and a 27-year-old man were killed.\n\n\u201cI hear the \u2018Boom! Boom! Boom!\u2019 and if I don\u2019t hear the crowd cheering I have to make sure everyone\u2019s okay,\u201d said Hawkins, a housekeeper. \u201cIf I hear the roar, then I know it\u2019s not gun shots.\u201d\n\nSouth Capitol Street, the major North-South thoroughfare, bisects the neighborhood and acts as a sort of dividing line between the new, sleek Washington and its older, grittier self.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo the east, where the ballpark is located, are new luxury apartments, waterfront restaurants, sculpted waterfalls and lawns with brightly colored Adirondack chairs. To the west, south of M Street SW, is the city as it has existed for generations: hundreds of units of public housing, privately owned rowhouses, a liquor store and a Chinese carryout where bulletproof glass separates the owners from their patrons.\n\n\u201cI think of the other side of South Capitol as being like New York,\u201d said Rhonda Hamilton, an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner who lives at the Syphax Gardens public housing community and grew up in Southwest Washington. \u201cI think of this side as D.C.\u201d\n\nOn Hamilton\u2019s side of South Capitol Street, public housing residents fret about whether they can remain as the neighborhood becomes more affluent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey see familiar places shuttering \u2014 a McDonald\u2019s or a neighborhood gas station \u2014 as evidence that their city is vanishing and being replaced a more expensive version. \u201cOver time, it ends up pushing people out,\u201d said Malik Richard, 48, a contractor who also lives at Syphax Gardens. \u201cThey don\u2019t want all this around here.\u201d\n\nOthers celebrate their rising property values.\n\nA 70-year-old retired paralegal who identified herself as Naomi X bought a rowhouse on Half Street SW 28 years ago for $80,000. Now it\u2019s worth at least five times that amount, according to records. She described herself as among the last black homeowners on her side of Half Street, which she said is now largely occupied by whites.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag, living near the stadium,\u201d she said as she sold Nationals T-shirts on Friday night outside Cap Liquor, across from the ballpark. \u201cBut as long as my property value goes up, it\u2019s cool. Everything has to change.\u201d\n\nEveryone complains about game day traffic and fans \u2014 easily identified by their \u201cScherzer\u201d and \u201cSoto\u201d Nats shirts \u2014 who take the neighborhood\u2019s street parking. They wish police officers \u2014 ubiquitous when the Nationals are playing \u2014 would be equally visible when the team is away.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey want that money to be safe,\u201d Curon \u201cGambino\u201d Salsibil, 47, who lives at Greenleaf Gardens, a public housing complex, said of the police presence when fans stream into the area. \u201cI need them to be here when there is no game.\u201d\n\nResidents said the Nationals have been generous neighbors, distributing free tickets and sponsoring youth baseball camps and no-cost dental care for children, and donating school supplies, holiday toys and turkeys. Many residents have gotten jobs at the stadium concession stands.\n\n\u201cThey are revenue,\u201d William Nelson Pickett, 61, who described himself as homeless, said of the team as he directed cars into lot Friday night. He said he typically earns at least $60 for a shift. \u201cI ain\u2019t missed one game.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLinda Brown, 60, who lives at Greenleaf Senior housing, said she earned an hourly wage at the Stadium\u2019s team store several years ago. But she said she left her job because it did not pay enough. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a position where you could move up,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the jobs that the community had were more entry level. There\u2019s not a lot of opportunity beyond that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe ballpark is part of an explosion of new development that has remade the waterfront on both sides of South Capitol Street, from the Navy Yard to the Wharf. At Buzzard Point, a few blocks from James Creek, 20,000 seat Audi Field opened last year. Nearby, a Cambria hotel is going up, a portion of it on land once occupied by low-cost rentals.\n\n\u201cOne day you saw people and then they were gone,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cThere\u2019s no security for us. How do we make sure we can be here?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe collective toll of the construction \u2014 the dust, traffic and commotion \u2014 has jangled nerves, she said. Too few neighborhood residents have gotten construction jobs or jobs at the new hotels and eateries, she said. \u201cI would expect to see a lot of our residents working when I go to those places, but I don\u2019t. It\u2019s very disappointing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn recent weeks, as the Nationals marched toward the World Series, residents said the hoopla surrounding the team has been a pleasant diversion from their usual worries. On Friday night, Andre Gethers, 36, a James Creek resident who works as a car detailer, strolled around the neighborhood in a Nationals jersey, \u201cZ-i-m-m-e-r-m-a-n\u201d printed across the back.\n\nOver the years, Gethers has attended only a couple of games. But he said that living close by \u2014 close enough to hear \u201cBaby Shark\u201d music when Gerardo Parra steps to the plate \u2014 makes him feel like he\u2019s somewhere special.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOtherwise there\u2019s nothing going on over here,\u201d he said.\n\nJust before the game began, Gethers took what he said was a rare walk to the other side of South Capitol Street \u2014 the ballpark side \u2014 hoping to watch the game on the big screens at the Bullpen, a popular open-air gathering spot for Nationals fans.\n\nBut the line to get in was far too long. Soon, he and his friends turned and walked back to their side of South Capitol.", "description": "The joy of overhearing the crowd\u2019s roar, even if you can\u2019t afford a ticket.", "authors": ["Paul Schwartzman", "Reporter Specializing In Political Profiles", "Narratives About Life", "Death", "Everything In Between"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gLBVNbFrrhctZxqWaLNZpplhhac=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DNVTCHWRMI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
