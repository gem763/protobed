The country\u2019s banking association said banks would remain closed until stability is restored, amid growing fears that a rush to withdraw savings when they reopen could deplete dwindling foreign currency deposits.\n\nSeparately, Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh said in a statement on Sunday that currency exchangers must be licensed by the central bank to move funds, do it through licensed companies or apply for a license.\n\n\u201cThen there are no restrictions on the amounts shipped and there is no need to request prior authorization,\u201d the central bank statement said.\n\n\u201cThe Lebanese exchange market will remain a free market in accordance with the current [central bank] laws and circulars. The BDL will not issue any new circular on this subject,\u201d it said.\n\nAs protests grip the country, Lebanon\u2019s banking association has held meetings in recent days in search of a way to reopen banks without triggering a run on deposits.\n\nThe historic wave of protests in Lebanon is targeted against political leaders blamed for corruption and steering the country toward economic collapse. There is no sign of moves toward a compromise between the government and protesters, whose demands include its resignation.\n\nLebanon, where the Lebanese pound currency is pegged to the dollar, is one of the world\u2019s most heavily indebted states.\n\nCapital inflows needed to finance the state deficit and pay for imports have been slowing down, generating financial pressures not seen in decades, including the emergence of a parallel market for dollars.", "description": "A Lebanese state prosecutor on Sunday banned traders and money exchangers from taking significant amounts of physical dollar currency out of the country at air and land borders, state news agency NNA said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
