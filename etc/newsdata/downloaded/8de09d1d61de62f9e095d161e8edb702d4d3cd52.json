Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and a campaign director for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden each took issue with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s co-founder and CEO, and the explanation he offered Thursday for the platform\u2019s new ad policy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 percent true,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said during a speech at Georgetown University. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians in a democracy.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren and Mr. Biden are currently both among front-runners seeking the Democratic nomination to run against in 2020 against President Trump, whose reelection campaign has already invested heavily on Facebook ads that his critics have characterized as untruthful.\n\nFacebook announced last month that it would not subject political ads to the same scrutiny as others, and its CEO\u2019s latest remarks did nothing to dispel concerns raised about the platform being weaponized to Mr. Trump\u2019s benefit for the second U.S. presidential race in a row.\n\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s speech today shows how little he learned from 2016, and how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election,\u201d Ms. Warren said on Twitter. \u201cFacebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again \u2014 and profit off of it.\u201d\n\nBill Russo, the Biden campaign\u2019s deputy communications director, concurred.\n\n\u201cFacebook has chosen to sell Americans\u2019 personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,\u201d Mr. Russo said in a statement. \u201cZuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company\u2019s bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook\u2019s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.\u201d\n\nA message requesting comment from Facebook was not immediately answered.\n\nFederal intelligence and law enforcement agencies have determined that Russians bought online advertisements displayed to U.S. voters during the last presidential election attacking Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent in the race, former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Facebook, Twitter and other platforms weaponized in 2016 subsequently introduced new policies in response, while legislation pending on Capitol Hill would subject social networking services to further reform if passed.\n\nBoth the Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee asked Facebook earlier this month to stop running an ad purchased by Mr. Trump\u2019s reelection team that alleged the former vice president acted corruptly while in office and that fellow Democrats are trying to \u201csteal\u201d the race. Facebook and several major TV networks have agreed to run the ad, while CNN has refused, saying the ad \u201cmakes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
