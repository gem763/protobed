I have never been so tired,\u201d gasped Leclerc as a sea of fans, starved of success at Monza since Fernando Alonso won in the red overalls, swept onto the pit straight to party below the overhanging podium with flags and flares.\n\n\u201cWinning here is just a dream,\u201d continued the Monegasque, switching to fluent Italian to address a crowd cheering a fitting win on the 90th anniversary of both Monza and Formula One\u2019s most glamorous team.\n\n\u201cLast weekend (in Belgium) was my first victory, but the emotion of winning here is 10 times that,\u201d said Leclerc, in only his 14th race for Ferrari. \u201cThanks to everybody. I have no words.\u201d\n\nHamilton\u2019s lead over his closest rival Bottas was cut to 62 points from 65, with the Briton limiting the damage by making a late pitstop for fresh tyres to set the fastest lap and gain an extra point.\n\n\u201cHe did a great job, congratulations to Ferrari,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cA lot of pressure from both Valtteri and I.\n\n\u201cI did the best I could. Obviously following so closely for such a long time, the tyres eventually just went off the cliff.\n\n\u201cBut nevertheless they were just quicker today, quicker in a straight line, so even if we did get close we couldn\u2019t pass. So not our day but still strong points for the team,\u201d added the 34-year-old.\n\nLeclerc\u2019s German team mate Sebastian Vettel had an afternoon to forget, his race going from bad to worse at the one circuit where every Ferrari driver wants to impress.\n\nWhile Leclerc led from pole position, the four-times champion spun off, dropped to last, served a 10 second stop/go penalty for a dangerous return to the track and was then lapped by his increasingly impressive team mate.\n\nStewards also handed him three penalty points, taking his 12 month tally to nine. If he gets three more in the next three races he will face a one-race ban.", "description": "Charles Leclerc triggered a red wave of Ferrari celebration on Sunday by holding off a race-long Mercedes challenge to take the Italian Formula One team's first home grand prix victory since 2010.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427668501&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870VV-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
