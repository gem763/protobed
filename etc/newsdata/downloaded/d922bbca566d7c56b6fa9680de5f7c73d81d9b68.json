We\u2019ve seen ones that fold like an overstuffed taco and ones that snap in half with a display that seems to go all the way around. Almost all of them are flexible tablets. That makes Microsoft\u2019s new phone and tiny laptop stand out.\n\nEverything about the design of the Duo and Neo reinforces the fact that these are genuine dual-display devices and not collapsible tablets. Rather than make a large foldable display that disappoints with clumsy construction, Microsoft seems to think it can deliver a better experience with two screens.\n\nThis is evident at the very highest level in the materials the company chose. Microsoft wanted to use Gorilla Glass to protect the displays and a full 360-degree hinge, both of which would have been impossible with a flexible OLED panel.\n\nThe Duo. (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nTwo displays mean, naturally, that there\u2019s a little gap between where the displays meet. That gap is taken up by bezel, hinge, and a bit of air. The gap measures about 8.9mm on the laptop-like Neo and less on the Duo phone. The Neo\u2019s two displays are each 9-inches diagonal when measured, but if you did try to use the Neo like a tablet, the combined displays would have a diagonal measurement of 13.1-inches. The Duo is made up of two 5.6-inch displays, which measure 8.3-inches diagonally when put together.\n\nDespite only handling a pre-production demonstration unit (it did not power on), I was impressed that the Duo does a decent job passing itself off as a phone. When I placed my Phone 11 Pro on top of the Duo, I noted that a single display was about three-quarters of an inch wider than my phone. When I closed the Duo, it was a little thicker but felt similarly heavy. The back of the device felt like it was composed entirely of glass (presumably the same Gorilla Glass used on the displays).\n\nThe Neo. (Photo: Alex Cranz, Gizmodo)\n\nThe Neo I handled was also a dummy. The keyboard, which will likely be a separate purchase, magnetically attaches to the back of the device like a big ugly grey strip. It comes off and attaches to the right display quite easily, and stayed in place even with a gentle shake of the entire device.\n\nThe keyboard has a slight wedge design so that when you close the Neo with the keyboard on the display there\u2019s a small gap. Typing on the keyboard was surprising. It\u2019s a much higher quality little doodad than Apple\u2019s terrible iPad keyboard. Snappier keys and better travel.\n\nBut boy is it cramped. The best comparison is, again, to the iPad, specifically the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. If you found typing on that keyboard to be too cramped, you\u2019ll be miserable on the Neo\u2019s keyboard. I have smaller-than-average hands and have few issues with the iPad, but I absolutely noticed the lack of space when I typed as if rattling off a few sentences on the Neo.\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo\n\nAs it stands, typing on the Duo one-handed will be tricky. Even folded and just using a single screen, it is too wide. Two hands will be better in that case. You could theoretically lay the Duo flat and type on it that way, but then the gap in the centre of the device will bisect the keyboard. Holding it like a tiny laptop and hammering out words with your thumbs makes more sense. One display will function as a keyboard while the other operates as a typical display in landscape view.\n\nMicrosoft envisions a few primary modes of using both the devices. For example, in a \u201cBook\u201d mode, you hold them much as you\u2019d hold an actual book, with the two displays functioning as two visible pages. A \u201cComposition\u201d mode should make it easier to turn one side of the device into a keyboard and use the other as a traditional display.\n\nThere\u2019s another mode where both screens operate as distinct elements independent of each other. If you tap an app in a display, it should open in that one, not across both, or garishly in the middle \u2014 with the hinge gap bisecting it.\n\nWindow management on the Neo will need to be seamless. In the limited time, I saw Microsoft employees using it, I didn\u2019t notice any shocking bugs. That\u2019s a welcome improvement compared to the prototypes we\u2019ve seen from Dell and Lenovo and dual-display Windows devices already available from HP and Asus.\n\nCuriously, with the Duo, there\u2019s more window management than on other flexible Android devices. The Galaxy Fold and Mate X both fold out into big square tablets, so Samsung and Huawei didn\u2019t have to significantly modify Android to get it to work. That\u2019s not the case for the Microsoft Surface Duo. Microsoft and Google are expected to work extensively together to tweak Android for better window management, and in the demo I saw, it seemed to work quite smoothly.\n\nThe extent of the partnership is still unclear, though. Presumably, the version of Android on the Duo won\u2019t be vanilla, so you\u2019ll have to wait for updates, but Microsoft isn\u2019t sharing details on that front at this time.\n\nApp makers should have APIs available from Microsoft to make their apps work better with dual display devices. It\u2019s not clear if Google will also have APIs available or if app makers hoping to produce Android apps for the Duo will have to seek out Microsoft for support.\n\nMicrosoft was also reluctant to share details on specs for either product. So there\u2019s no clarity on 5G or storage or RAM options. The Duo I saw had a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, which is this year\u2019s fastest mobile-based Snapdragon CPU. The chip will likely change when the device launches next year.\n\nThe Neo will have an Intel 11th-generation Lakefield processor, but there\u2019s no word on how many cores the CPU will have or what series of Intel processors it will belong to. One would assume it will use a low-powered Y-series processor like those used in super thin and light devices, but given the custom silicon we saw in the Laptop 3 and Surface Pro X, it could be custom too.\n\nThere\u2019s still quite a bit that remains up in the air with these devices. While they might look like they\u2019re ready to ship tomorrow, and while the demos on stage might reinforce that notion, these things are still a year away. The hardware and software will definitely change. However, no matter how it changes, one thing will stay extremely consistent: these won\u2019t just be folding tablets.\n\nFor the flashiness of the flexible devices we saw this year, Microsoft obviously thinks two is better than a transforming one. That\u2019s going to be incredible for people who regularly open two apps on a device or wish their phone had just a little more screen real estate. I\u2019m not entirely sure if I personally like the approach. I typically wish I could just fold the Surface Go I lug around in half. I rarely feel like I need two Surface Gos bolted together. Maybe the Neo and Duo will change my mind.", "description": "I only got a little time with the Duo and Neo, Microsoft\u2019s new dual-display devices, but that little time made one thing clear: Microsoft has a wildly different approach to the collapsible device than just about everyone else....", "authors": ["David Nield", "Germain Lussier"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/nu4zzairoxvqwfydg1d4.jpg"}
