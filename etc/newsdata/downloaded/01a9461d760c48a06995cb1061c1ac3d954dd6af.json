And, just before she played BBC Radio 2's Hyde Park festival, Ballerini talked about the making of the record, being inducted to the Grand Old Opry at the tender age of 25, and the time Beyonc\u00e9's sister stole her luggage.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The singer has been part of a new wave of upstart country musicians that also includes Maren Morris and Kane Brown\n\nLet's just take a moment to admire this glitter ball.\n\nI mean, honestly, that's all I really should talk about. It's amazing.\n\nYour last couple of singles have had a poppy, glitter ball feeling, but Homecoming Queen is more heartfelt. What inspired it?\n\nI was touring really heavily and on [social media] I was only really showing the really cool moments of my life - on stage or on a red carpet, all that kind of stuff.\n\nWhat I wasn't showing was that I was feeling really painfully insecure. So I wrote this song to say it's OK to feel what you feel, and it's also OK to share it, because we're all human. You're allowed to have a bad day, you know?\n\nThe pressure to be \"Instagram perfect\" can be very damaging.\n\nYes, I think we've lost connection to other people because we're not sharing those vulnerable moments. So I wanted to be the first one to be like, \"Well, here's an ugly cry!\"\n\nWhich leads straight to the video. How nervous were you to film it?\n\nI collaborated with [director] Shane Drake on the treatment, and we knew it would be emotional - but I wasn't really planning on losing it.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nWhen we'd shot the whole thing, Shane squatted down by my chair and said, \"All right, we've got what we need but we're going to do one more take for safety.\"\n\nThen he said, \"Listen, I know you wrote the song. I just want to know why you wrote it,\" and he got up and walked out.\n\nAnd I just snapped back into that place of writing it, of feeling lonely and insecure and anxious, and I lost it, and that's the take that you see.\n\nHomecoming Queen is the first taste of the new album. What stage are you at with that?\n\nWe have 10 songs done, hundreds written, and we're trying to figure what other colours and textures we need. There's a song with horns, a song with a string quartet, two collaborations that are polar opposites, musically. I'm just having fun.\n\nLyrically, your last album covered two years, from a horrible break-up to getting married. Is this the next chapter?\n\nIt's not. This time, I took the pressure off having a concept and just let myself write. And I wrote like crazy. I wrote more country than I've ever written and more pop than I've ever written. We put the saddest song out first.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Kelsea Ballerini - Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park 2019\n\nYou were inducted to the Grand Old Opry earlier this year - at quite an early stage of your career, if I'm right?\n\nI know, I didn't expect it to happen so soon.\n\nHow did it come about?\n\nIt actually happened on stage. I was playing the Opry the same night as a Little Big Town, and they texted me and said, \"Hey, do you want to sing Girl Crush with us?\"\n\nBut when they brought me out, they sang in four part harmony, \"Kelsea, do you want to join the Opry?\" and I just sobbed. It's a running theme.\n\nYou were inducted by your idol, Carrie Underwood. What was it like to perform with her on that stage?\n\nThe coolest part wasn't even anything that people saw. I was rehearsing backstage with Carrie, facing each other with our lyric sheets and working out who's singing what, when all of a sudden we hear a third harmony come in. It turned out Keith Urban had been roaming the halls of the Opry and he just walked in the room, singing.\n\nTo me, that was the moment, because it was like, \"This is what it means: You're part of this family forever.\"\n\nYou recently wrote on Twitter that you'd decided to \"care more about the meal than the bloat\". Have you stuck to that?\n\nYeah. That's why there's a treadmill: Just run it off. It's fine!\n\nActually, I'm not a treadmill person, I don't know why I said that. I love cycle class, though.\n\nI don't like spin classes because the music puts me off. I prefer to listen to podcasts if I'm at the gym.\n\nHave you listened to Crime Junkie? Oh my gosh, it's so good. I can't watch CSI because I'm such a chicken but Crime Junkie, for some reason, is my obsession. What do you listen to?\n\nDo you know Song Exploder? There's an incredible episode where Solange picks apart the recording of Cranes In The Sky.\n\nOh, I have a really funny Solange story! She'd been in Tennessee to play the Bonnaroo festival and we were on the same flight to LA, when she accidentally took my bag. We literally had to hunt her down through, like, 70 people before we got it back.\n\nSo basically, Solange stole my backpack.\n\nIf she'd ended up in your wardrobe, what would she have been wearing?\n\nI was going to LA for one of the collaborations on my album, so I was trying to look cute because I wanted to take photos while we were recording the vocals. But I was also trying to look casual, 'cause I didn't want to look like I was trying too hard. So I had a giant neon sweater and jean shorts and cowgirl boots. Solange would have rocked it.\n\nImage copyright Piper Ferguson Image caption The singer's third album is set for release in spring 2020\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
