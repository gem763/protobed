The Black Knights (3-4) have dropped three in a row and are under .500 for the first time since the 2015 team went 2-10.\n\nTra Barnett ran 17 times for 108 yards and a TD, and Ellington had 232 yards passing and 39 rushing for the Panthers. Sandon McCoy ran for two Army touchdowns, but Payne\u2019s 8-yard TD catch over the middle was the Panthers\u2019 second straight score and proved decisive. Roger Carter caught a conversion pass to put the Panthers up 28-21.\n\nThe Black Knights took their only lead midway through the third quarter after Connor Slomka broke off a 32-yard run and Jalen Moy scored his first career touchdown on a 16-yard misdirection run that made it 21-14.\n\nGeorgia State drove 75 yards in 16 plays to cut the lead to one on Tra Barnett\u2019s 1-yard run, but Brandon Wright missed the extra-point attempt to the right side. Barnett tied a school record with his 13th career rushing TD.\n\nThe first half was tied at 14-all.\n\nEllington connected on a 24-yard pass near the left pylon to Sam Pinckney, who made an over-the-shoulder catch to beat Javhari Bourdeau and put the Panthers up 7-0.\n\nThe Black Knights answered on the ensuing drive. Standing fourth-and-goal at the 2, coach Jeff Monken called timeout to set up a quick-snap handoff to McCoy, who dove over the goal line unscathed and rolled out of a somersault to make it 7-all.\n\nBoth teams lost a fumble on their next possessions, Georgia State at the Army 3 and the Black Knights at the Army 46. Cole Christiansen recovered for Army after a bobbled shotgun snap. Victor Heyward jarred the ball out for Georgia State, and Remy Lazarus fell on the ball.\n\nThree plays later, Pinckey beat Bourdeau again for a 12-yard score, winning on a high pass in the end zone. McCoy followed on Army\u2019s next possession with a TD, making it 14-all with a hard push through three defenders on an 8-yard run.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nArmy: The Black Knights looked sharp offensively at times and converted two fourth downs on their final drive, but the effort wasn\u2019t enough as the defense couldn\u2019t stop Georgia State on consecutive scoring drives in the second half.\n\nGeorgia State: The defense, which began the game ranked 122th nationally in scoring, held Army when it mattered most. With Hopkins heaving the ball to the right side from the 28, White jumped for the pick and returned the ball 27 yards to ice the game.\n\nINJURIES\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain how much longer Army free safety Jaylon McClinton can go. The senior was limited in warmups and was hurt on the opening drive, marking the fifth straight game he either hasn\u2019t played or had his game cut short by injury. Georgia State linebacker Ed Curney, the team\u2019s leading tackler this season, limped off the field with a left leg injury after getting hurt in the first. After making it to the sideline, he was carted to the locker room.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArmy hosts San Jose State next Saturday and visits Air Force on Nov. 2.\n\nGeorgia State hosts Troy next Saturday and has a bye the following week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dan Ellington passed for three touchdowns, Aubry Payne caught the go-ahead score midway through the fourth quarter and Georgia State's defense held on the final drive in a 28-21 victory over Army on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
