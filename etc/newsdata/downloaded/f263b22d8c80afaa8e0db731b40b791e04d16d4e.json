Adam Schefter of ESPN reignited discussions about Brady\u2019s future in New England when he said that staying with the Patriots next season is the \u201cleast-likely\u201d option for the 42-year-old signal caller if he wants to continue playing.\n\nThe two other options for Brady, according to Schefter, are to retire after this season or move on and join another team in his 21st season in the league.\n\nDuring ESPN\u2019s NFL Countdown, Moss, who played alongside Brady with the Patriots from 2007 to 2010, said he got the indication that the veteran signal-caller still wants to play football.\n\nBrady has done a lot for Patriots\n\n\u201cHe still loves the game, he\u2019s still playing at a high level,\u201d said Moss, adding that the possibility of Brady playing with another team would look weird. \u201cFor me, to look at Tom Brady in another jersey, it would look weird,\u201d said Moss.\n\nHowever, the Hall of Fame receiver said he won\u2019t eliminate the possibility that Brady might take his talent elsewhere, just like what Brett Favre and Peyton Manning did in the latter part of their Hall of Fame careers.\n\n\u201cHey, we\u2019ve seen the best of them, from Favre to Manning, move on,\u201d said Moss. \u201cIt\u2019s just seems weird that a man that has done so much for one organization, it\u2019s just hard to see him in another uniform,\u201d he added.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL New England Patriots\n\nBased on their short conversation before the Patriots\u2019 Monday Night Football (MNF) clash with the New York Jets, Moss said he got an indication that Brady wants to play football and he still loves to play at a high level. Earlier, ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith said that Patriots CEO Robert Kraft won\u2019t allow Brady to leave New England, but if he indeed leaves, Tennessee could be an option as he is close with Titans head coach Mike Vrabel.\n\nBeckham praises Patriots, gifts Brady with GOAT shoes\n\nCleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was gracious even in defeat as he heaped praises on the New England Patriots\u2019 defense following their 27-13 loss on Sunday at Gillette Stadium. Beckham was limited to just five catches for 52 yards and no touchdown by the Patriots defense. \u201cIt's not like we look into that, but this is a real defense.\n\nThis is a very, very good team,\u201d said Beckham, who particularly lauded Patriots cornerback Stephon Gilmore for effectively covering him all game long. After the game Beckham had a long chat with Brady after giving him a pair of goat hair cleats, referring to the quarterback\u2019s status as \u201cGreatest of All Time.\u201d Earlier, Beckham stirred rumors after declaring that he wants to play for the Patriots.", "description": "Moss said the possibility of the 42-year-old Brady playing in another uniform would look weird.", "authors": ["Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Trade Rumors", "Patriots Want To Add Pass Catchers", "Offensive Line Help Before Deadline", "Bolt Ready To Play For Patriots", "Dorsett", "Izzo Possible Trade Targets For Other Teams", "Tom Brady Shows Love For Mom", "Daughter"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/28/os/b_1200x630/brady-threw-two-touchdown-passes-in-27-13-win-over-browns-in-week-8-image-credit-new-england-patriotsyoutube_2345719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
