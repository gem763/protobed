The deal, for an undisclosed sum, will bolster the company\u2019s efforts to expand into businesses outside its core ride-hailing service.\n\nCornershop, founded in 2015, is currently active in Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Canada, and it\u2019s headquartered in Santiago. In a statement, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company would seek to \u201cscale their vision, and look forward to working with them to bring grocery delivery to millions of consumers on the Uber platform.\u201d That will mean eventually launching the service in the US, though the deal is still subject to regulatory approval.\n\nUber is entering a crowded field\n\nBut Uber is entering a crowded field, with huge companies like Amazon, Instacart, and Postmates jockeying for market share with major grocers like Kroger and Walmart. And it\u2019s not an obvious moneymaker either. Right now, only 3 percent of grocery sales in the US take place online. Customers say they feel hesitant to shop for groceries online for fear of being overcharged or experiencing late deliveries, according to a recent survey.\n\nThis won\u2019t be Uber\u2019s first stab at expanding its on-demand delivery service: the company first launched Uber Rush in 2014, but it never expanded beyond New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago. Uber Rush was shut down in 2018.\n\nNow, Uber wants to be an \u201coperating system\u201d for cities, and grocery delivery seems like a more obvious play. In a recent interview with The Verge, Khosrowshahi says the company will consider any type of business that fits in with that ethos.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to look at a lot of categories going forward and some of them we will fulfill through our own internal services,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think that you should think about Uber as a marketplace.\u201d", "description": "Uber is making moves into the highly competitive world of online grocery deliveries with the acquisition of a startup called Cornershop.
