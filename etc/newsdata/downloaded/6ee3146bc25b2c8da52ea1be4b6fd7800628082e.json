Ted Yoho, Florida Republican, said in an interview after the classified briefing with Mr. Khalilzad.\n\nThe session was believed to be Mr. Khalilzad\u2019s first extensive description to lawmakers of the course of the Taliban talks, the deal \u201cin principle\u201d announced at the beginning of September, and the sequence of events where Mr. Trump first planned and then called off a secret Camp David summit with Taliban leaders and the president of the U.S.-backed Afghan government in Kabul intended to seal the agreement.\n\nIn a later open hearing, acting Assistant Secretary of State Alice Wells told the House panel the U.S.-Taliban talks had \u201cbroken new ground in this last round of negotiations that took place,\u201d and also hinted the Trump administration has not ruled out a return to the bargaining table.\n\n\u201cWe would like to see the Taliban take actions that would allow us to return to negotiations,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Yoho explained that he was satisfied with Mr. Khalilzad\u2019s answers \u201con some things\u201d dealing with the state of the Afghan mission, including \u201cgains made on education, some of the infrastructure, [and] women going to school.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just want to make sure that gains we\u2019ve made, they build upon that,\u201d Mr. Yoho said. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress.\u201d\n\nBut the overture to the Taliban has proven divisive within Mr. Trump\u2019s own administration, and been watched with growing unease in Kabul, where the government of President Ashraf Ghani was excluded from Mr. Khalilzad\u2019s negotiations. Critics say the Taliban couldn\u2019t be trusted to carry out promises to break with terror groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State in Afghanistan or to engage in good-faith power-sharing talks with the Kabul government.\n\nMr. Trump said he called off the Camp David talks in response to a Taliban terror strike in Kabul on the eve of the meeting that killed a dozen people, including a U.S. soldier, and said the negotiations were \u201cdead.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats were harshly critical of the month of whipsawed diplomacy, which has been followed by intensified fighting in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Afghan reconciliation process go off the rails in a spectacular fashion,\u201d House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Eliot Engel said during an open hearing.\n\nMr. Engel had issued a subpoena for Mr. Khalilzad\u2019s testimony last week after three requests sent to the State Department for a briefing for the committee went unanswered.\n\nThe New York Democrat announced late Wednesday he had struck an agreement with the department to hold a closed-door briefing with the U.S.\u2019s special envoy with committee members.\n\nThe tentative deal would have quickly withdrawn some 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan, with a conditions-based withdrawal of the remainder of the force in less than a year. Mr. Trump has long been critical of the costly, stalemated U.S. military mission there.\n\nThursday\u2019s hearings came just hours after a drone strike blamed on U.S. forces killed 16 people in a farming town in Afghanistan\u2019s Nanghar province. Col. Sonny Legget of the U.S. Forces in Afghanistan, told the Associated Press said the U.S. military was \u201cworking with local officials to determine the facts.\u201d\n\nHours after, a suicide bomb \u2014 later claimed by the Taliban \u2014 rocked a hospital in southern Afghanistan, killing at least 20 people and wounding over 90 others.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
