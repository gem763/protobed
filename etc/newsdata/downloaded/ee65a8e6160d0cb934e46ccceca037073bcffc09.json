(See it above.)\n\nMaher, who hosts his own talk show on HBO, \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\u201d last week did a bit on obesity in which he joked: \u201cFat isn\u2019t a birth defect. Nobody comes out of the womb needing to buy two seats on the airplane.\u201d He added: \u201cFat-shaming doesn\u2019t need to end. It needs to make a comeback.\u201d\n\nCorden summarized his own weight problems and fired back: \u201cWe\u2019re not all as lucky as Bill Maher. We don\u2019t all have a sense of superiority that burns 35,000 calories a day.\u201d\n\nCorden reminded his talk show rival that fat-shaming doesn\u2019t help anyone and is merely bullying. He showed another clip of Maher mocking the overweight, in which the HBO host sniped: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being able to see a doctor. It\u2019s also about being able to see your dick.\u201d\n\nPeering into the camera, Corden deadpanned: \u201cBelieve me, I can see a dick.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d personality concluded: \u201cIn the meantime, Bill, while you\u2019re encouraging people to think about what goes into their mouths, just think a little harder about what comes out of yours.\u201d\n\nWatch the full takedown above.", "description": "\"The Late Late Show\" host hilariously did some shaming of his own to rebut the \"Real Time\" comedian.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b6e302400001227794da2.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
