If this were to happen, the United States has said it won\u2019t intervene.\n\nOn Friday, SDF forces said several Syrian Islamic State prisoners escaped from a detention facility in Qamishli, in northeastern Syria, after Turkish forces bombed it. Kurdish forces are caught between protecting the prisons and camps and staving off Turkish soldiers at the border. Controlling prisoners has also become one of their last bargaining chips for trying to influence what they see as an increasingly fickle United States.\n\nThere\u2019s much we don\u2019t know about these prisons. The SDF remains secretive about many detention facilities, with foreign journalists, researchers and humanitarian aid workers allowed to access only a few. A few hold the most hardcore members. Many of the detention facilities are overcrowded \u201cpop-up\u201d prisons, converted schools or government offices where men are crammed in rooms without beds or mattresses and have little room to lie down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cISIS would be very interested\u201d in learning more about these facilities, said Elizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow in the Middle East Program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. An SDF spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nSo far, the State Department has said there are no or just a few prisons in the area that Turkey has moved into. But Turkish authorities have also said they want to build a buffer zone 30 kilometers deep into Syria, and about 15 percent of the 10,000 prisoners are in that zone, according to the State Department. Turkey has also signaled, and Kurdish forces fear, that the Turks will seize the opportunity and overrun the entire border area, in which there are more detention facilities.\n\nThe makeshift nature of many of these prisons is a concern. According to a recent report by Washington-based International Crisis Group, \u201cThe SDF\u2019s Western Coalition partners have been legally unable to contribute more than limited funds to reinforce existing detention facilities and turn buildings such as schools into \u2018pop-up prisons.\u2019 \u201d That\u2019s because the U.S. money that the SDF is receiving is congressionally mandated not to be used to build new structures, including better prisons.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSDF partners have been concerned that ISIS could target these makeshift prisons for jailbreaks or that prisoners could stage riots that turn into mass escapes, a threat that will become all the more serious now that Turkey and its allies are entering northeastern Syria and the SDF will have to redirect its resources to confronting them,\u201d the report continued.\n\nOf the estimated 10,000 Islamic State members held, around 2,000 are foreign fighters representing over 40 countries. The foreign fighters are generally hardcore supporters of the extremist group, compared to many of the Iraqi and Syrians who joined for socio-economic rather than ideological reasons.\n\nThe United States has taken into custody and transferred to Iraq two high-profile detainees from Britain \u2014 Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh \u2014 who are accused of being part of the notorious \u201cBeatles\u201d who executed American hostages. U.S. officials are also weighing whether to take into custody or transfer another 40 individuals considered important Islamic State members.\n\nThe United States has so far remained mum about what to do if a prison break comes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Liz Sly and Missy Ryan reported, \u201cU.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the evolving U.S. strategy in Syria, said the Pentagon did not have enough forces to oversee the prisons if those facilities were left unguarded, nor a mandate to do so.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the detention for facilities, there are camps holding the wives and children of suspected fighters, some of whom are themselves members and supporters of the organization.\n\nObservers have said that the dismal Hol detention camp \u2014 holding an estimated 70,000 women and children \u2014 could be a particular risk, as it\u2019s badly secured and houses some very radicalized and violent female detainees.\n\n\u201cThe camp is surrounded by a flimsy fence and lacks even basic security precautions such as searchlights,\u201d Sly and Ryan reported Tuesday. \u201cIn an interview last week, the SDF\u2019s top commander, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, said Kurdish guards don\u2019t have \u2019100 percent\u2019 control of the camp.\u201d\n\nSome of the Kurdish prisons have tried to take a different approach, aiming \u201cto rehabilitate and reintegrate many of the Islamic State fighters in their custody, in hopes of deterring a revival of the militant movement,\u201d as Sly reported.\n\nBut these efforts at breaking the cycle of revenge take time and resources, something increasingly elusive as military operations escalate.\n\nAD", "description": "Kurdish forces are caught between protecting the prisons holding Islamic State fighters and their families and staving off Turkish soldiers at their border.", "authors": ["Miriam Berger"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ln5vLl32GlInZnxyXS__K15_KkI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2GBT73VURQI6TLGIDWCHXLGKOM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
