She should have stuck to her guns.\n\nIn surrendering to the radicals and the noisy drumbeat of their media handmaidens, Pelosi established a formal investigative process involving the top legislative committees.\n\nYet she did something else, too, something far more monumental: She effectively committed House Dems to impeaching President Trump.\n\nPELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP\n\nBecause of what she said and did, if the House doesn\u2019t go all the way, it will be a political disaster. Either failing to take a vote on articles of impeachment, or failing to get enough votes among her majority to pass any articles, would be seen as a political exoneration for Trump, likely leading to his re-election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIf all that weren\u2019t risky enough, consider another scenario. If House Dems do impeach Trump on grounds that much of the public sees as flimsy and concocted, they could win the battle and lose the war. Indeed, no matter what the House does, there is a next-to-zero chance the GOP controlled Senate would convict the president absent clear and convincing \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nPelosi knew all that since January, when she became Speaker, which is why she kept resisting the impeachers. But her surrender proved again that her party can\u2019t quit 2016. Like generals fighting the last war, she and they are now committed to taking their sore-loser grievances to 2020 voters.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDems apparently assume the country hates Trump as much as they do. President Hillary Clinton had no comment on the strategy.\n\nThey also are demonstrating they didn\u2019t learn the lessons of the Robert Mueller probe.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING MICHAEL GOODWIN'S COLUMN IN THE NEW YORK POST", "description": "Speaker Pelosi has effectively\u00a0committed House Democrats to impeaching President Trump.", "authors": ["Michael Goodwin"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/24/694940094001_6089163107001_6089165701001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2016-09-25"}
