This is resulting in a humanitarian crisis in the affected areas and we are thankful for every contribution to our drought relief fund,\" Strydom said.", "description": "The Western Cape government has made R50m in emergency drought relief available to farmers in drought-stricken areas of the province, much to the relief of Agri Western Cape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7347/b78692b88dbc4e668b9a513a2e289f67.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
