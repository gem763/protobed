He also calls for replacing the giant credit reporting agencies with a \u201cpublic credit registry\u201d that would ignore medical debt when calculating credit scores.\n\nThe proposals reflect Mr. Sanders\u2019s concern that the medical system has placed financial hardships on too many Americans, by discouraging them from seeking needed medical care \u2014 but also by saddling them with expensive and unfair bills that can harm their financial security, ding their credit and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy\u2026\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re addressing it on both ends,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past due medical bills. And we\u2019re addressing it by finally creating a health care system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Bernie-Medical-Debt-Healthcare.Html Smid Tw-Nytimes Smtyp Cur"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
