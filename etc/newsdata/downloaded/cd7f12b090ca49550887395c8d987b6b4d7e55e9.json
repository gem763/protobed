Not everybody agrees,\" he said, adding that people he'd spoken to have said the situation is already out of control.\n\nAt least five people have been killed since the demonstrations began, according to the public defender's office, while thousands more have been injured.\n\nProtesters on Saturday blocked road access to the city's international airport and set fire to the national auditor's office as police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets and authorities imposed water and power cuts across the city.\n\nEcuador's energy minister said on Saturday that closures of oil wells by protesters had curbed production of more than one million barrels of crude so far, while a Chinese-owned copper mine announced it was temporarily limiting its operations as a precautionary measure.", "description": "Announcement comes as indigenous leaders agreed to direct talks with Lenin Moreno, while chaos raged on Quito's streets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/12/a1c2e3fba9cd4ab9a3cd76b7ad8cbe3b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
