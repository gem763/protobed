He described him as smelling of alcohol.\n\n\u2018The defendant made a hand gesture sticking two fingers up at the male and \u201cwhy did you do this?\u201d He had no idea what he was talking about.\u2019\n\nCould a no-deal Brexit still happen?\n\nThey then had an argument before the victim went inside. Four hours later at 1am, he was brushing his teeth in his bathroom when he heard an \u2018almighty bang\u2019.\n\n\u2018The defendant smashed his door open and came into the bathroom. He was carrying a pumpkin which he smashed over the mans head\u2019, Ms Evans added.\n\n\u2018This knocked him to the floor and the defendant was shouting \u2018I\u2019m going to f*****g kill you, you c***\u2019.\n\n\u2018The defendant had a piece of broken wood that had come off the door which had nails in it which he used to hit the complainant.\n\n\u2018He then dragged him into the bedroom and started kicking his head and body as he was curled up into a ball.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKisiel only stopped attacking the man when a woman appeared and called the police. The victim was left with cuts and bruises to his eye, head, back,shoulders, arms and legs.\n\nIn an impact statement read out at court, he said he \u2018should be able to feel safe in his own home\u2019 and that he won\u2019t feel safe now because of the fear of \u2018someone coming through his door and attacking him\u2019 again.\n\nWhat happens to Brexit if Boris Johnson's deal fails?\n\nIn mitigation David Morton said his client, who has previous convictions for battery and common assaults, continues to deny the offence.\n\nHe described him as being \u2018clearly focused on family\u2019 and as being a hard-working citizen since he moved to the UK from Poland in 2009.\n\nBut Judge Anthony Cross QC described Kisiel\u2019s attack as \u2018ferocious\u2019 and brutal\u2019.\n\n\u2018The victim would have expected that he was safe in his own home\u2019, the judge told him while passing sentence.\n\n\u2018But four hours after your first encounter, in the dead of the night, at a time when we are entitled to feel safe from intruders, he was brushing his teeth when you burst into his apartment breaking the door down and shattering the frame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You picked up a pumpkin from somewhere and hit him with it and knocked him to the floor. You picked up a piece of wood and made about him. You struck him numerous times and he was unable to defend himself.\n\n\u2018At some point during that attack you told him you wanted to kill him. You dragged him to the bedroom and began the third stage of this brutal assault. You kicked him in his head and his body.\n\n\u2018The violence stopped only because a woman appeared and the police were called and you were arrested.\n\n\u2018Your victim was left with the consequences of your actions. Pictures of his injuries show the ferocity of this random attack and I am satisfied that your victim suffered serious injuries.\n\n\u2018You are a violent man, of that I am sure. You have demonstrates no remove whatsoever and this is a serious offence.\u2019\n\nKisiel, of Great Clowes Street in Salford, was jailed for four years.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
