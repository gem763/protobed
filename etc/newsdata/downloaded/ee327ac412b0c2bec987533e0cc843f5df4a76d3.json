Thank you very much. I want to thank my former teammates for being there for me. So, a lot of them came home to check up on my boy. Also, I want to thank the Yankees, a lot of my boys over there and checked up on Big Papi. Thank you very much, appreciate it. CC (Sabathia), (Edwin) Encarnaci\u00f3n. Thank you very much. God bless you all. Go Sox.\u201d\n\nWearing a white No. 34 home jersey with black slacks, he entered the field to a rousing ovation. When the game started, he took a seat in the first row, right next to Boston\u2019s dugout, giving his jersey to a young boy seated a few rows back in the first inning.\n\nThe 43-year-old Ortiz, the 2013 World Series MVP on Boston\u2019s championship team, was shot in the back by a hired gunman who drove up on a motorcycle and fired at close range, hitting him in the torso, police said. They said the intended target was another man.\n\nDoctors in Santo Domingo removed Ortiz\u2019s gallbladder and part of his intestine, and he was flown the next day on a Red Sox plane to Boston, where he had more surgery.\n\nA 10-time All-Star, Ortiz helped the Red Sox end their 86-year championship drought in 2004 and batted .688 against the St. Louis Cardinals in \u201813 to win the Series MVP.\n\nBut it was his jovial manner and ready smile that further endeared him to the city. Before the first Red Sox home game after the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, he took the same mound with a microphone and told the crowd, \u201cThis is our (expletive) city, and no one\u2019s going to dictate our freedom.\u201d\n\nHe retired after the 2016 season with 541 home runs, and the team quickly retired his uniform No. 34. The city named a street and bridge outside the ballpark after him.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Jimmy Golen contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former Red Sox slugger David Ortiz had a chance to thank his adoring fans at Fenway Park exactly three months after he was shot in the back while in his native Dominican Republic.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Powtak"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/yankees_red_sox_baseball_02096_c0-155-3706-2315_s1770x1032.jpg?de7ad3953c8e0e9b2f1b2ac53f4d00199dbd056a", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
