Yesterday Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein shared a story written by former ThinkProgress writer (now Vox writer) Ian Millhiser about what the future holds unless the Democrats manage to somehow get rid of the Electoral College and go to a national \u201cpopular vote\u201d system for electing the president:\n\nDue to the electoral college and population patterns, a new study predicts that \u201cIn the modern period, Republicans should be expected to win 65% of Presidential contests in which they narrowly lose the popular vote.\u201d https://t.co/QPUVsaSk7V \u2014 Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) September 17, 2019\n\nAnd with that, @Neontaster dismantled that particular hot take in just four tweets:\n\nFor the gazillionth time \u2013 this is only true because nobody is trying to get the most overall votes. There is zero effort put into that front so those numbers are irrelevant. https://t.co/AMhfBpGdbD \u2014 neontaster (@neontaster) September 18, 2019\n\nCorrect. A \u201cpopular vote\u201d election can\u2019t be predicted based on past Electoral College rules because that\u2019s not the game the candidates have been playing (well, except maybe for Hillary in 2016):\n\nIf NPV was the deciding factor, way more republicans in deep blue states would vote than do now (hello CA and NY). This is really basic stuff. \u2014 neontaster (@neontaster) September 18, 2019\n\nWhich brings this to 2016:\n\nThe amazing thing about this is that Donna Brazille actually cared about artificially inflating democrat voting numbers in places like Chicago that were already in the democratic bag, thus taking Hillary money away from battleground states she ended up losing. pic.twitter.com/MVe3Hi8NKB \u2014 neontaster (@neontaster) September 18, 2019\n\nSo they were afraid he would lose the general but win the popular vote, so they put efforts into winning the popular vote and ended up losing the general. Their obsession with the popular vote played an actual role in her loss. Talk about irony. \u2014 neontaster (@neontaster) September 18, 2019\n\nOUCH! Brutal, but absolutely true.\n\nThis is what winning the popular vote got Hillary. pic.twitter.com/VNQPOKSuN1 \u2014 Respectable Username (@somethi79963647) September 18, 2019\n\nDOUBLE ouch!", "description": "Brutal truth (Team Hillary hardest hit).", "authors": ["Doug P.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nuclear-bomb_new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
