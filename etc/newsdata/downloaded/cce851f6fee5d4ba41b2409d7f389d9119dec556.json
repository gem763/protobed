They come a day after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission hit NBN Co with an official warning for discriminating between enterprise retailers.\n\nIn December last year NBN Co announced its intention to pursue a greater market share of the enterprise business. This took some telcos by surprise, because NBN Co had, until then, been focused on rolling out a residential network.\n\nNBN Co has a near-monopoly in the residential fixed-line market, meaning companies like Telstra, Optus, TPG and Vocus have been largely excluded from laying fibre to residential customers. But the enterprise market remains open to competition, and all those companies continue to lay fibre for business customers.\n\nMr Russell said he did not object to NBN Co's entry into the enterprise segment in theory, saying it had the \"potential to unlock productivity benefits in regional Australia\" where businesses were not adequately served by the private sector.\n\n\"However, NBN\u2019s current investment strategy is very different,\" he said. \"Instead of building new fibre to fill the gaps in under-served areas, NBN is actively prioritising building in already well-served metropolitan areas.\n\n\"Vocus\u2019 own Melbourne office exemplifies this problem. If you go into the communications room in the basement of 452 Flinders Street, you\u2019ll find no fewer than six fibre providers that have invested capital to provide competitive services. And recently, NBN became the seventh. Is this really where NBN should be spending taxpayer dollars?\"\n\nMr Russell said the only reason NBN Co was pursuing the enterprise market was to hit its target 3.2 per cent rate of return necessary to keep the project in the black and off the federal budget. But he complained 3.2 per cent was not a commercial rate of return, and therefore gave the government-underwritten NBN Co an unfair edge over privately funded competitors.\n\nHe called for the new statement of expectations to explicitly ban NBN Co from designing tenders with end users, entering into contracts with end users, negotiating buying commitments and terms of service with end users, signing confidentiality agreements with end users, and recommending retailers to end users.\n\nAsked to respond to Mr Russell's claims, an NBN Co spokesman said: \"NBN Co may enter into commercial arrangements with a customer to provide a network technology change at a premise, for example, our Technology Choice program, which has been in place in one form or another since 2012. Applications for technology changes can be submitted by a customer or by a retail provider on behalf of their customer.\"", "description": "Vocus chief exeuctive Kevin Russell has accused NBN Co of breaking its wholesale-only remit and wasting taxpayers' money.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e8e694a387bf68ac8aff6bdf0d5d7207e40eb897", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
