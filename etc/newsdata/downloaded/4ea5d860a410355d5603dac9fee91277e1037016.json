According to a White House official who spoke to The Washington Post, Trump had edited the map using a black marker.\n\nThe president also used Twitter to defend his claims and demanded \"apologies\" from news reporters, who he alleged were misconstruing his statements. In the tweet, Trump submitted an indeterminate \" spaghetti plot\" map as evidence that Alabama was, at one point, susceptible to the path of the hurricane.\n\nRead more: Trump reportedly told a Coast Guard admiral to give a statement defending his Hurricane Dorian confusion\n\nHowever, the plot map did not take into account critical factors that determine a more accurate prediction of the trajectory of the storm's path. It did not include information about wind speeds, and showed the possible routes based on atmospheric conditions and the path of previous storms.\n\nThe plot map Trump revealed also noted on the bottom that \"if anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore this entire product.\"\n\nNOAA's statement follows a similar one from another government official. On Thursday, US Coast Guard Rear Admiral Peter Brown, a Homeland Security and counterterrorism advisor, appeared to take some of the blame for the confusion from Trump's claims.\n\nBrown said in his statement that Trump's comments regarding Hurricane Dorian were based on a briefing, one that \"included the possibility of tropical storm force winds in southeastern Alabama.\"\n\nA White House source familiar with the matter said Trump personally directed Brown to give the statement, according to CNN.", "description": "The controversy over the likelihood of how Alabama could be impacted by Hurricane Dorian has now enveloped the White House for an entire week.", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72d6c22e22af336075bfd0-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
