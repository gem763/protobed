In this unique exclusive, Ms Junkets offers up a variety of innovative Aussie-inspired Brexit plans that would have easily solved the current impasse.\n\nThe Rudd Brexit Plan: Designed on the back of a Belgian beer coaster at Brussels airport, the National Brexit Network allows for every household in Britain to be connected via high-speed fibre-optic cables to every house on the European continent, thereby allowing normal communications and business interactions to occur even though Britain is no longer part of the EU. Estimated to cost a lazy \u00a343 trillion ($81 trillion), which would be \u201coff the books\u201d, the scheme would also see households in Northern Ireland fitted with complimentary pink backstops.\n\nThe Gillard Brexism Plan: Citing education as the key to blocking Brexit, under the Gillard Global Education Fund, British taxpayers will donate \u00a3300 billion to the Brexit Foundation (copyright H. Clinton) which will then employ Ms Gillard for a suitable fee to head up the Brexit Partnership for Education in order to teach British schoolgirls that she will not be lectured about Brexism by THAT man Nigel Farage, who is a misogynist because he wears a blue tie and rudely looks at his watch whenever the EU is mentioned.\n\nThe Abbott Brexit Plan: In order to prove the inferiority of heavily subsidised and over-regulated common market agricultural goods, such as the French red or white \"oignon\", Mr Abbott proposes a series of gastronomic English Brown Onion Eating referenda.\n\nThe Turnbull Brexit 2.0 Plan: Instead of having a border in the Irish Sea, Mr Turnbull proposes moving the Irish Sea to the border. Said a jubilant spokeswoman for Mr Turnbull, who only gave her name as Lucy: \u201cThis is a truly agile and innovative plan and makes it an exciting time to be part of Brexit. Every night we will pump all the water out of the Irish Sea and into the border counties, allowing people to simply stroll across the mudflats thereby guaranteeing the free movement of goods between Northern Ireland and Great Britain all night long when tariffs are off-peak, but then during the day we will pump all the water back out to sea allowing the free movement of goods and people between the two Irelands during normal working hours.\u201d\n\nScoMo's 'miracle plan'", "description": "Think Boris's Brexit Plan is bad?
