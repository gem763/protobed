Holder Jr., who served as President Obama\u2019s first attorney general, said in an interview airing Saturday.\n\nMr. Holder said that Mr. Trump could face criminal charges after leaving office in connection with crimes committed by Michael Cohen, the president\u2019s former longtime personal lawyer, and that Congress should in the meantime move forward with considering whether he warrants being removed by impeachment, CNN reported.\n\nThe head of the Department of Justice for six years under former President Barack Obama, Mr. Holder made the comments during an interview with CNN host and former Obama adviser David Axelrod. The network published excerpts from the segment ahead of its first airing Saturday night.\n\nAsked during the interview if he thought Mr. Trump could be prosecuted once his presidency ends, Mr. Holder reportedly answered: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe already have an indictment in the Southern District of New York where Michael Cohen (was charged) relative to the payoffs, Michael Cohen\u2019s already in jail with regard to his role there,\u201d said Mr. Holder, according to the excerpts.\n\n\u201cIt would seem to me that the next attorney general, the next president is going to have to make a determination,\u201d Mr. Holder added.\n\nCohen, 53, pleaded guilty last year to criminal charges stemming from his time working as the president personal lawyer, including campaign finance violations related to making illegal hush-money payments meant to silence two women who alleged having affairs with Mr. Trump. He is currently serving a related three years sentence in federal prison.\n\nCohen has claimed that the president directed him to make the illegal payments, and Mr. Trump is referred to in related charging documents as \u201cIndividual-1.\u201d Justice Department policy prevents criminals charges from being brought against a sitting president, effectively sparring Mr. Trump from prosecution the time being, however.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Holder said that he believes Democrats controlling the House of Representatives should proceed \u2014 cautiously \u2014 with plans to consider whether Congress should remove Mr. Trump from office by impeachment.\n\n\u201cI think that they should proceed with an impeachment inquiry, an impeachment investigation,\u201d Mr. Holder told CNN.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily commit you to actually impeaching the president,\u201d Mr. Holder added, noting the Congress could instead take a less drastic route such as simply censuring Mr. Trump rather than risking putting him on trial.\n\n\u201cI think there is a potential cost to the nation by putting on trial a former president, and that ought to at least be a part of the calculus that goes into the determination that has to be made by the next attorney general,\u201d Mr. Holder added, according to CNN.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
