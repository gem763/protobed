'It took us a long time. They are a good quality side and they showed it, especially in the first half.\n\nAll 19 of Samoa's points came via Henry Taefu, who scored 4 pens, a try and two conversions\n\n'Luckily for us, we got through in the last minute for the bonus point so we are delighted about the result.\n\n'We know that Scotland will be a really important game, so we will go back to our preparations and get it done.'\n\nThe opening half was littered with errors as both sides battled to assert themselves, though Japan created the greater scoring opportunities but struggled at the breakdown as Samoa won six turnovers.\n\nThe home side took a 6-0 lead through two penalties from Tamura, but a couple of indiscretions at the ruck allowed Samoa to level the score through centre Henry Taefu.\n\nThe home side came into the contest intent on a kicking game but that at times meant giving up quality possession, so they switched tactics in the second half with great effect.\n\nSamoa's disciplinary issues continued when flanker TJ Ioane was sent to the sin-bin for a no-arms tackle, their fifth yellow card of the tournament, and while he was off the field Japan scored their opening try.\n\nSamoa picked up their fifth yellow card of the tournament when TJ Ioane was cautioned\n\nMatsushima made an incisive break towards the Samoan line and, after he was brought down five metres short, the ball was fed out to Samoan-born Lafaele to cross over for a 16-9 halftime advantage.\n\nSamoa lost experienced fullback Tim Nanai-Williams just before the break with a head injury, hampering them in both attack and defence.\n\nThe teams traded penalties at the start of the second period before Japan scored a second try on 56 minutes to open up some daylight on the scoreboard.\n\nThey got a massive shove going in the maul from an attacking lineout and Himeno collapsed over the line.\n\nSamoa, though, showed admirable fighting spirit and, after dominating possession and winning a succession of penalties inside the Japan 22, Taefu crossed to bring them back into the contest.\n\nBut Japan, roared on by their home support, drove the ball back towards the Samoan line from the kick-off and Fukuoka crossed in the corner, before the lively Matsushima secured the bonus-point with the final play of the game.\n\n'We will take the lessons from this,' Samoa captain Jack Lam said. 'We've still got one game to go (against Ireland).\n\n'Japan have set the tone in our pool. We threw our best punch but couldn't come up with a winner there.'
