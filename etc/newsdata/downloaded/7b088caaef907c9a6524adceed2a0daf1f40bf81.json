It all went down Sunday in Toronto against the Blue Jays.\n\nThe right-hander became the first pitcher to throw two no-hitters as a visitor in the same park \u2014 he also threw one at Rogers Centre in 2011 with Detroit. His other no-no was in 2007 for the Tigers against Milwaukee.\n\nHe punctuated a dominant season by striking out 14 to lead the Houston Astros past the Toronto Blue Jays 2-0 on Sunday.\n\nVerlander allowed only one runner, with Cavan Biggio drawing a one-out walk in the first inning. The Blue Jays, with a lineup full of young, aggressive batters, never came close to a hit.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t put it into words,\u201d Verlander said, moments after the final out.\n\nThe 36-year-old Verlander joined Nolan Ryan (seven), Sandy Koufax (four) and Bob Feller, Cy Young and 1880s-era Larry Corcoran (three) in rarefied air on the no-hitter list.\n\n\u201cSome of the guys I\u2019ve idolized,\u201d Verlander said.\n\nIt came after a series of close calls over the years.\n\nVerlander lost a no-hit try in the eighth inning late in 2011, had bids broken in the ninth in 2012 and 2015 and had another attempt spoiled last May in the seventh by Jose Abreu of the White Sox.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come so close to the third one so many times,\u201d Verlander said.\n\nOn this afternoon, he brought it home. Verlander threw a season-high 120 pitches, mixing a fastball that reached the upper 90s mph with a sharp curve.\n\nVerlander retired the last 26 hitters in a row. But, he still needed help because the game was scoreless going into the last inning \u2014 according to baseball rules, Verlander had to pitch a complete game to get credit for a no-hitter.\n\nThat\u2019s when Canadian-born rookie Abraham Toro stepped up for the AL West leaders. The Astros newcomer hit a two-out, two-run homer in the ninth inning off Ken Giles (2-3) that cleared the way for Verlander to complete the no-hitter.\n\nToro made a routine play on Bo Bichette\u2019s grounder to third base for the last out.\n\nHUGH FREEZE COACHES LIBERTY FOOTBALL TEAM, GIVES MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH FROM HOSPITAL BED\n\nVerlander joked the 22-year-old Toro, playing just his eighth game in the majors, was in for quite a nice reward.\n\nThis was the fourth no-hitter in the majors this year. The last one was by the Astros, too, a combined effort from Aaron Sanchez, Will Harris, Joe Biagini and Chris Devenski (9) against Seattle on Aug. 3.\n\nOakland\u2019s Mike Fiers and a tandem effort by Taylor Cole and Felix Pena of the Angels accounted for this year\u2019s other gems.\n\nVerlander (17-5) is tied for the big league lead in wins. He tops the majors in strikeouts (257) and innings (193) and leads the AL with a 2.56 ERA.\n\nWith the crowd of 24,104 getting to its feet to begin the ninth, Verlander retired Brandon Drury on an easy grounder and struck out Reese McGuire.\n\nAfter that second out, catcher Robinson Chirinos went to the mound for a quick visit with Verlander. The count went full on Bichette, who fouled off a pitch before hitting a bouncer to Toro.\n\nVerlander took a couple of hops toward first as he watched Toro field the ball, saw the throw on target and then began the celebration in the middle of the diamond.\n\nNot bad for an ace who was ejected in his previous start. Verlander was tossed last Tuesday at home shortly after a close pitch didn\u2019t go his way against Tampa Bay.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt was Verlander\u2019s ninth career shutout.\n\nThis was the 13th no-hitter for the Astros, including one by Ryan.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Justin Verlander pitched his third career no-hitter, punctuating a dominant season by striking out 14 to lead the Houston Astros past the Toronto Blue Jays 2-0 on Sunday.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
