He quickly climbed in the polls as the flavor of the week, but his numbers began tanking as he set off on a voyage of self-discovery across the nation or something. That led to a \u201crelaunch\u201d of the campaign a few months later. And then there was a re-relaunch this summer.\n\nSadly for Beto, he\u2019s still rattling around near the bottom of the tank in terms of support. And you know what that means. Yep. He\u2019s re-re-relaunching the campaign, albeit in a bit more unofficial fashion. So I suppose we can look forward to some big changes. (Associated Press)\n\nLooking to recapture the early enthusiasm surrounding his candidacy, O\u2019Rourke is pursuing the go-anywhere, freewheeling style that made him a Democratic star last year while nearly upsetting Sen. Ted Cruz. After a mass shooting last month in his hometown of El Paso, O\u2019Rourke has again remade his White House bid, this time around decrying what he calls President Donald Trump\u2019s racism and sympathy for white supremacy, as well as combating gun violence. He\u2019s still visiting Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, which kick off the presidential contest. But he\u2019s also turned up at places like an Arkansas gun show, where he debated banning assault weapons with self-described conservatives.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much of a change this really is. A \u201cgo-anywhere, freewheeling\u201d campaign sounds exciting, but he\u2019s mostly visiting Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. In other words, he\u2019s doing what the rest of the candidates are. Yes, he\u2019s sandwiched in some stops in places like Arkansas and Mississippi, but all of his opponents show up in a few oddball places just to mix things up.\n\nAs the AP report goes on to remind us, there is one element of his style where he\u2019s switched things up. He\u2019s gone back to swearing on camera. I don\u2019t know what that buys him in terms of support, but I suppose he thinks it makes him sound more folksy and genuine. Or maybe he\u2019s just trying for the sailors\u2019 vote.\n\nWhichever direction he decides to go, he\u2019s going to need to come up with some sort of plan quickly. He scored a whopping one percent in the national Economist/YouGov poll that dropped yesterday. His RCP average is sitting at 2.8%, which has been good enough to get him into the debates, but he\u2019s also trailing Andrew Yang so take that for what it\u2019s worth.\n\nHow many more tricks can Beto have left in his bag at this point? He\u2019s not pitching any radically different policies than most of the rest of the field, so announcing some new plan to fix the country\u2019s problems isn\u2019t likely to help him break back into the front tier. Is he desperate enough to really start throwing some haymakers at the debate tonight? He can go after Biden from the left for being too moderate, I suppose. Or even too old and infirm, though that carries some risks. But what will he attack Warren and Sanders on? He could talk about how their plans will bankrupt the nation, but so will his.\n\nWe started with Beto and Beto 2.0. If my math is anywhere near accurate, I think we\u2019re up to Beto 4.0 now. And there probably isn\u2019t going to be time for a fifth edition.", "description": "Pick a lane, Mac.", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BetoHands.jpg"}
