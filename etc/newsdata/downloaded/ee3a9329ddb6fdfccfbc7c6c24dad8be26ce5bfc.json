In July 2017, Gemmel Moore, 26, also died from a methamphetamine overdose at Buck\u2019s home.\n\nBoth men were black. Buck, who is white, was not charged and critics later questioned if wealth, race or political ties influenced the investigation.\n\nMoore\u2019s mother, LaTisha Nixon, \u201cis relieved that Ed Buck is no longer on the streets and free to continue harming black men,\u201d her lawyer, Hussain Turk, said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cShe is also disappointed that the county\u2019s criminal charges against Ed Buck do not include charges for homicide,\u201d Turk said.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBuck was taken into custody Tuesday, and prosecutors argued in court documents that he should be held on $4 million bail because he is a \u201cviolent, dangerous sexual predator\u201d who offered drugs, money and shelter to mainly addicted and homeless men in exchange for participating in sexual fetishes. One fetish involved administering dangerous doses of drugs, the documents said.\n\nBuck, 65, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to California candidates, including Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, and is well known in LGBTQ political circles. According to federal records, Buck contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic groups, including $1,500 to the Obama campaign and $2,950 to the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Prosecutors allege Democratic megadonor Ed Buck tried to stop a man whom\u00a0he allegedly had injected with methamphetamine from leaving his West Hollywood apartment to call 911.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
