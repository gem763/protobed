It hit a low in July and then the worries about a no-deal Brexit meant the spread widened,\" said Daniel Lenz, a rates strategist at DZ Bank.\n\n\"But in recent days in particular we have seen a tightening in the spread and that shows investors are less concerned about Brexit.\"\n\nIn the euro zone, the mood among German investors worsened only slightly in October, a survey showed on Tuesday, beating an analyst consensus for a bigger drop amid concerns that Europe's biggest economy could be headed towards a recession.\n\n\n\n\n\nJean-Christophe Machado, fixed income strategist at Natixis said he is not keeping a close eye on such indicators like the sentiment survey. He was instead keen on seeing the sentiment index and PMIs following a Brexit deal, adding that even a no-deal Brexit could potentially lead to an improvement.\n\n\"Some people might say it's behind us now and we know what's happening,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and Yoruk Bahceli; Additional reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft; Editing by Ed Osmond and Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "Euro zone government bonds sold off on Tuesday after a news report that UK and EU negotiators were close to a draft deal on Brexit boosted investors' risk appetite.
