Not that this was any comfort as I arrived there one summer, my more-than-slightly unenthusiastic girlfriend in tow, only to be confronted by rows of headstones bristling into the horizon. We had come for one grave in particular. But how to find it amid this riot of marble and faded lettering?\n\nOur dreaded sunny day at the cemetery gates had already involved a winding drive from central Providence past the Rhode Island School of Design, where the future members of Talking Heads had met in the mid-Seventies (and where Seth MacFarlane created Family Guy).\n\nNow came the true challenge. Swan Point is the final resting place of HP Lovecraft, father of modern horror and among the greatest pulp authors of all time (and also a racist of considerable derangement). The world is about to receive another reminder of his gibbering genius with a Nicolas Cage-starring adaptation of cosmic fright-fest Colour Out of Space, premiering at the London Film Festival on Monday.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAs a fan of Lovecraft\u2019s writing (his racism was not yet on my radar), I\u2019d begged that we go out of our way on our holiday to visit Providence. This was our second attempt at honouring Howard Phillips. The first had come unstuck several days previously when we missed our Greyhound stop in the city centre and ended up at staring at the Cyclopean battlements of the Foxwood Casino in Connecticut (cue bonus cosmic terror). But now, finally, we\u2019d made it.\n\nThe only problem \u2013 and this hadn\u2019t detained us earlier because we were young and flying by our pants \u2013 was that Swan Point is vast: more than 200 acres and with some 40,000 individual plots. In America, even the baroque New England graveyards are supersized. Just then a chap wearing a uniform and driving a miniaturised tractor trundled up. He was a dead ringer for Richard Farnsworth in David Lynch\u2019s The Straight Story. I explained that we had come with a particular purpose in mind.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 40 books to read before you die Show all 40 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 40 books to read before you die 1/40 Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen It is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don\u2019t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart expos\u00e9 of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there\u2019s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face. 2/40 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 \u00be, Sue Townsend Read this one when you\u2019re decrepit enough, and chances are you\u2019ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there\u2019s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain. 3/40 Catch 22, Joseph Heller It\u2019s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book\u2019s glorious rage. 4/40 Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy A good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a na\u00efve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the \u201cshame\u201d of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming. 5/40 Things fall apart, Chinua Achebe A classic expos\u00e9 of colonialism, Achebe\u2019s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work. 6/40 1984, George Orwell The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9. But forget TV\u2019s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind. 7/40 To kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America\u2019s racist South during the depression years, Lee\u2019s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but \u201ca quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers\u201d: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum. 8/40 Great Expectations, Charles Dickens Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens\u2019 luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose. 9/40 The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy Roy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating \u201cwho should be loved, and how. And how much\u201d. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it\u2019s all there in this beautiful and haunting book. 10/40 Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition. 11/40 The Code of the Woosters, PG Wodehouse If you haven\u2019t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven\u2019t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts. 12/40 Frankenstein, Mary Shelley Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein\u2019s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 13/40 Lord of the Flies, William Golding Anyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding\u2019s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile. 14/40 Midnight's Children, Salman Rushdie The protagonist of Rushdie\u2019s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He\u2019s also born with superpowers, and he\u2019s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India\u2019s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities. 15/40 Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature\u2019s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the \u201csmall, plain\u201d Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplomb 16/40 Middlemarch, George Eliot This is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829\u201332. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius; but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. 17/40 Secret History, Donna Tartt Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. 18/40 Americanah, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash divisions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch. 19/40 Cold Comfort Farm, Stella Gibbons An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you\u2019ve \u201cseen something nasty in the woodshed,\u201d just shut the door. 20/40 Beloved, Toni Morrison Dedicated to the \u201cSixty Million and more\u201d Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America\u2019s history. 21/40 Brideshead Revisited, Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles\u2019s entire relationship with Sebastian\u2019s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts\u2026) and you\u2019re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. 22/40 Dune, Frank Herbert You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It\u2019s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it\u2019s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised. 23/40 Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy\u2019s every command. It\u2019s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers; Emily Bronte\u2019s vision of nature blazes with poetry. 24/40 The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s third novel \u2013 \u201cno more than a glorified anecdote\u201d; \u201cfor the season only\u201d \u2013 failed to recognise something truly great; a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal\u2019s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann\u2019s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald\u2019s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper and beyond. 25/40 A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it\u2019s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess\u2019s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece. 26/40 Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her \u201cLolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\u201d Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert\u2019s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides. 27/40 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K Dick Here be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen \u2013 the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed. 28/40 Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad Inspired by Conrad\u2019s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it\u2019s deeply involving and demands to be read. 29/40 Dracula, Bram Stoker Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It\u2019s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker\u2019s hands he\u2019s also bloody creepy. 30/40 The Catcher in the Rye, J D Salinger It only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger\u2019s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details \u201cand all that David Copperfield kind of crap\u201d. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose. 31/40 The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her \u201clittle sharp predatory teeth\u201d and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men. 32/40 Vanity Fair, William Makepeace Thackeray All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray\u2019s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature\u2019s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she\u2019s all the more compelling for that. 33/40 The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book\u2019s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar \u2013 used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments \u2013 struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel\u2019s publication in 1963. 34/40 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl Harry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka\u2019s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl\u2019s startling work of fantasy. 35/40 Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy Andrew Davies\u2019s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can\u2019t quite face returning to the novel\u2019s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina \u2013 enormous, too! \u2013the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society\u2019s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. 36/40 Dangerous Liaisons, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise\u2019s justification for her behaviour \u2013 \u201cI, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours\u201d \u2013 will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos\u2019s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 37/40 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez The energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez\u2019s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez\u2019s magical realism unique. 38/40 The Trial, Frank Kafka \u201cSomeone must have been telling lies about Josef K\u2026\u201d So begins Kafka\u2019s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they\u2019re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it\u2019s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance. 39/40 Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier\u2019s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. 40/40 The Leopard, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi\u2019s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It\u2019s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces. 1/40 Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen It is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don\u2019t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart expos\u00e9 of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there\u2019s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face. 2/40 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 \u00be, Sue Townsend Read this one when you\u2019re decrepit enough, and chances are you\u2019ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there\u2019s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain. 3/40 Catch 22, Joseph Heller It\u2019s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book\u2019s glorious rage. 4/40 Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy A good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a na\u00efve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the \u201cshame\u201d of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming. 5/40 Things fall apart, Chinua Achebe A classic expos\u00e9 of colonialism, Achebe\u2019s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work. 6/40 1984, George Orwell The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9.

Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but \u201ca quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers\u201d: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum. 8/40 Great Expectations, Charles Dickens Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens\u2019 luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose. 9/40 The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy Roy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating \u201cwho should be loved, and how. And how much\u201d. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it\u2019s all there in this beautiful and haunting book. 10/40 Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition. 11/40 The Code of the Woosters, PG Wodehouse If you haven\u2019t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven\u2019t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts. 12/40 Frankenstein, Mary Shelley Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story.

Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash divisions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch. 19/40 Cold Comfort Farm, Stella Gibbons An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel.

Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles\u2019s entire relationship with Sebastian\u2019s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts\u2026) and you\u2019re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. 22/40 Dune, Frank Herbert You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It\u2019s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it\u2019s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised. 23/40 Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy\u2019s every command. It\u2019s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers; Emily Bronte\u2019s vision of nature blazes with poetry. 24/40 The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s third novel \u2013 \u201cno more than a glorified anecdote\u201d; \u201cfor the season only\u201d \u2013 failed to recognise something truly great; a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal\u2019s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann\u2019s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald\u2019s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper and beyond. 25/40 A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it\u2019s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess\u2019s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece. 26/40 Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her \u201cLolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\u201d Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert\u2019s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides. 27/40 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K Dick Here be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen \u2013 the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed. 28/40 Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad Inspired by Conrad\u2019s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it\u2019s deeply involving and demands to be read. 29/40 Dracula, Bram Stoker Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It\u2019s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker\u2019s hands he\u2019s also bloody creepy. 30/40 The Catcher in the Rye, J D Salinger It only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger\u2019s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details \u201cand all that David Copperfield kind of crap\u201d. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose. 31/40 The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her \u201clittle sharp predatory teeth\u201d and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men. 32/40 Vanity Fair, William Makepeace Thackeray All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray\u2019s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature\u2019s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she\u2019s all the more compelling for that. 33/40 The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book\u2019s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar \u2013 used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments \u2013 struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel\u2019s publication in 1963. 34/40 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl Harry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka\u2019s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl\u2019s startling work of fantasy. 35/40 Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy Andrew Davies\u2019s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can\u2019t quite face returning to the novel\u2019s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina \u2013 enormous, too! \u2013the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society\u2019s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. 36/40 Dangerous Liaisons, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise\u2019s justification for her behaviour \u2013 \u201cI, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours\u201d \u2013 will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos\u2019s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 37/40 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez The energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez\u2019s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez\u2019s magical realism unique. 38/40 The Trial, Frank Kafka \u201cSomeone must have been telling lies about Josef K\u2026\u201d So begins Kafka\u2019s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they\u2019re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it\u2019s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance. 39/40 Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier\u2019s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. 40/40 The Leopard, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi\u2019s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It\u2019s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.\n\n\u201cLovecraft,\u201d he guessed, and then we were back in the car following him as he zag-zagged through a blur of mausoleums. Not for the first time that afternoon my girlfriend and her pals, who had driven us from Boston, were throwing me funny glances. What exactly were we all doing here?\n\nLovecraft has been my favourite author since I was a teenager. I\u2019d discovered him first through tabletop role-playing game Call of Cthulhu, named after one of his best-known stories (in turn named after its famous octopus-headed demigod). At Mountains of Madness and Other Stories was the first Lovecraft book I\u2019d purchased, from my local Waterstones with money saved during a summer spent potato picking at a nearby farm.\n\nThe connection made more sense than you might imagine. The sensation of kneeling in wet potato tubers, which spatter and spray slime in the manner of an HR Giger alien egg, has stayed with me. It and my memory of At the Mountains of Madness are inextricable linked. The sensory horror of flapping about in decaying tuber is bound up with reading for the first time of the doomed Dyer expedition to Antarctica, and its run-ins with giant penguins and evil sentient pudding.\n\nAt the risk of me sounding like a Nirvana fan who insisted they never did better than Bleach, it\u2019s fair to say that the Lovecraft industry was in its formative stages when I discovered him. Even when I visited Providence and finally came upon his grave \u2013 it was surprisingly small and overshadowed by a nearby tree into which HPL fans had etched Cthulhu-themed graffiti \u2013 his reputation was still ascending. The stars were not yet quite right.\n\nToday, by contrast, Lovecraft is mega-box office. Downstairs at the Forbidden Planet flagship store in London there is a dedicated Lovecraft section. It offers not just anthology after anthology of his work but literary tributes by other writers, card games, novelty children\u2019s books and, of course, the ubiquitous plush Cthulhu teddy bear. No other genre writer receives such VIP treatment \u2013 not Tolkien, Rowling or George RR Martin.\n\nLovecraft fans are, moreover, legion. One of my weirdest ever journalistic experiences was interviewing Irish actor Jack Reynor, then best known for playing a vapid hunk in Transformers: Age of Extinction.\n\nHe copped my Miskatonic University T-shirt \u2013 the name of Lovecraft\u2019s fictional university \u2013 and gushed about his fondness for the author and how he\u2019d always wanted to bring HPL to the screen. A few heads turned when the jock-ish Reynor fetched up in Ari Aster\u2019s pagan horror Midsommar recently but not mine. This guy had been with the programme quite a while.\n\nOscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro is another member of our little funny handshake coven. He sweated blood attempting to make a $150m adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness. Tom Cruise \u2013 who, as his Oprah couch-bouncing confirmed, knows all about conjuring terrifying forces beyond our understanding \u2013 was even attached at one point. Alas, the project fell apart as the thematically similar Prometheus quasi-flopped.\n\nBut at least Del Toro\u2019s Cthulhu credentials were beyond questioning. The amphibious romantic lead of his gong-garnering The Shape of Water (2017) was essentially a derivation of Lovecraft\u2019s water-dwelling race of Deep Ones. And when invited to direct a Simpsons title sequence, he made sure Cthulhu \u2013 all eight eyes present and correct \u2013 featured.\n\nNicolas Cage has now joined the club and, really, it is no surprise. He has teamed up with Richard Stanley, who made the fantastic Hardware (1990) and Dust Devil (1992) and then was famously fired from 1996 Marlon Brando dumpster fire The Island of Doctor Moreau.\n\nTogether they have updated Lovecraft\u2019s 1927 story The Colour Out of Space for the 21st century. As in the original text, the setting is a remote farm where a mysterious asteroid has crash-landed. The borders of reality warp. Soon locals are behaving peculiarly. And then things get nasty. Once again, I\u2019m reminded of my summer picking potatoes.\n\nIf the premise sounds familiar it is because it has been plundered on multiple occasions. Every Cold War American sci-fi film in which an isolated community is overrun by extra terrestrials bears a little of its DNA. And the recent Netflix/Alex Garland adaptation of Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s Annihilation is essentially a big-budget homage to the Lovecraft yarn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the story that inspired half the sci-fi movies of the 1950s,\u201d Stanley said at a recent Q&A. \u201cThe Thing from Another World, The Blob...\u201d\n\nYet the cult of Lovecraft has also brought attention to the author\u2019s less savoury qualities. Raised in genteel poverty in Providence, he was an unabashed Anglophile who perceived himself as a British gentleman living in the wrong time and place. Unfortunately, he was under the impression that part of a British gentleman\u2019s make-up was to be a bug-eyed xenophobe.\n\n\u201cA maze of hybrid squalor\u201d is how he describes an ethnic neighbourhood of New York in his 1925 chiller The Horror at Red Hook. He writes of \u201cAsian dregs\u201d and the \u201cswart, insolent\u201d crew of a tramp steamer.\n\nThese descriptions are largely incidental. One could enjoy Red Hook with the racism expunged. Yet Lovecraft\u2019s obsession with racial purity and the danger of tainting the blood lines is front and centre of some of his most important stories. Consider, my favourite, The Shadow over Innsmouth from 1931. It tells of an obscure New England fishing village where the locals have, through decades of miscegenation with Deep One fish-men from the South Seas, horrifically diluted their humanity.\n\nLovecraft\u2019s evocation of a decaying fishing town is so acutely drawn you can almost smell the brine and the sea breeze. It\u2019s a riveting read, too: the tension as the narrator clops around, gradually realising he has placed himself in terrible danger, tightens like razor wire around your neck.\n\nAlas, the ultimate message that \u201csuperior\u201d races must forbear from mingling with their lessers is the stuff of white supremacist fever dreams. I still love The Shadow over Innsmouth. But I\u2019m not sure I would recommend it today.\n\nA backlash was inevitable. The point of fracture was the World Fantasy Awards, a sort of Oscars for fantastical writing. Until 2016, the awards took the form of a bust bearing Lovecraft\u2019s likeness. For authors of a minority background, having a HPL effigy on the shelf was understandably problematic.\n\n\u201cA statuette of this racist man\u2019s head is in my home. A statuette of this racist man\u2019s head is one of my greatest honours as a writer,\u201d said Nigerian-American writer Nnedi Okorafor, the first black person to win the WFA for best novel. The trophy has since been redesigned: recipients of the prize no longer have to stare into the vacant visage of an author who approved of Hitler.\n\n\u201cThe racism is a BIG problem with HPL as a person and it does pervade some of the stories,\u201d says Julian Simpson, the writer, director and dramatist who adapted Lovecraft\u2019s The Case of Charles Dexter Ward as an acclaimed BBC podcast last year (a follow-up retelling of Lovecraft\u2019s The Whisperer in Darkness debuts in December).\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s overt, sometimes you feel like it\u2019s in the subtext. I didn\u2019t worry about it with Charles Dexter Ward because it\u2019s not really present in the story anyway and because our adaptation is sufficiently loose to be able to avoid anything that might have been a problem.\u201d\n\nHe feared nearly everything. I read an account of him nearly fainting from the site of a fish on a plate Paul Carrick\n\n\u201cHis racism is an uncomfortable fact about him which can\u2019t be denied and mustn\u2019t be ignored,\u201d adds fantasy and sci-fi writer James Lovegrove, who has made his own contribution to Lovecraftian lore by pitting Sherlock Holmes against the \u201cmythos\u201d in his fantastic Cthulhu Casebooks novels.\n\n\u201cHe was a product of his times, yes, but even by those standards his views were pretty extreme. Even if we can separate the work from the man, it\u2019s still there in the numerous references in his writings to \u2018subhuman\u2019 and \u2018inferior\u2019 races who are more susceptible than the \u2018purer\u2019 races to the gods\u2019 evil influence. I attempted to tackle this in the second of my Cthulhu Casebooks trilogy, Sherlock Holmes and the Miskatonic Monstrosities, by having an overtly racist character get his comeuppance.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a nettle I was extremely unwilling to grasp. We just have to accept, I feel, that Lovecraft himself was a pretty wretched individual whose misery and misanthropy somehow alchemised into fiction of lasting impact, influence and insight.\u201d\n\nArtist Paul Carrick, whose Lovecraftian illustrations have drawn considerable acclaim, agrees. \u201cI cannot argue that Lovecraft did not have some racist feelings. Would I prefer it that he didn\u2019t feel what he felt? Absolutely. Might we not have the stories as we know them if he was a model citizen of today\u2019s standards? I bet we wouldn\u2019t. His uncomfortable feelings were the sand in the oyster which created some incredible pearls.\u201d\n\nLovecraft, as Carrick points out, wasn\u2019t just a racist: he had all sorts of hang-ups. If there\u2019s a phobia, he probably suffered it. \u201cHe feared nearly everything. He was afraid of change, and so immigrants were a source of change. He was afraid of the sea, which explains why so many of his creatures and alien races had aquatic elements within them. I read an account of him nearly fainting from the site of a fish on a plate.\n\n\u201cHe more or less lived in a bubble for the first 20 or so years, and unfortunately many people born in the 1800s had racist views. I think we all like to imagine that if we were in his shoes we would act as if it were the present day, but I tend to regard this as wishful thinking.\n\n\u201cFortunately, we can say that, as he got older, he started to experience more of the world and loosen his views about other races and cultures. He married a Jewish woman and also gained friends outside of his culture, both of which I would imagine was unthinkable to a younger Lovecraft.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 37 horror films that are genuinely scary Show all 37 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 37 horror films that are genuinely scary 1/37 Funny Games (1997) Directed by: Michael Haneke : Michael Haneke Funny Games places the horror in the familiar setting of home. It follows two young men who hold a family hostage and torture them with sadistic games. The result is far scarier than anything featuring ghosts, witches or demons. Concorde-Castle Rock/Turner 2/37 The Amityville Horror (1979) Directed by: Stuart Rosenberg : Stuart Rosenberg The Amityville Horror is based on the true story of the Lutzes, a family who were run out of their home after being terrorised by paranormal phenomena in 1975. Just one year before, Ronald DeFeo Jr shot and killed six members of his family in the same house. James Brolin and Margot Kidder lead this film, which became one of the biggest hits of 1979. American International Pictures 3/37 Audition (1999) Directed by: Takashi Miike : Takashi Miike Japanese horror Audition (1999) follows a widower who meets a woman named Ayoma after staging auditions to meet a potential new partner. Soon, though, her dark past begins to surface, which equates to a pretty disturbing climax. Omega Project 4/37 The Blair Witch Project (1999) Directed by: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo S\u00e1nchez : Daniel Myrick, Eduardo S\u00e1nchez Although parodied to death, The Blair Witch Project popularised the found-footage format to terrifying degrees in 1999. People genuinely believed they were watching real clips of three student filmmakers being terrorised by a Maryland legend known as the Blair Witch. Artisan Entertainment 5/37 The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) Directed by: Robert Wiene : Robert Wiene Black-and-white silent horror film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) is considered the quintessential work of German Expressionism, but also one of the scariest films in cinema history. It follows a hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist to commit murders, and Wiene's shadowed sets and striking visual style combines to unsettle the viewer in ways most filmmakers only dream of managing. Decla-Bioscop 6/37 Candyman (1992) Directed by: Bernard Rose : Bernard Rose A contemporary classic of horror cinema, 1992 film Candyman \u2013 which spawned two sequels and has a Jordan Peele-produced remake in the works \u2013 follows a graduate student whose studies lead her to the legend of a ghost who appears when you say his name three times. TriStar Pictures 7/37 Cannibal Holocaust (1980) Directed by: Ruggero Deodato : Ruggero Deodato Extreme enough to warrant a ban in Italy and Australia, Cannibal Holocaust (1980) was one of the first films to embrace the found-footage format \u2013 so much so that Deodato found himself charged with multiple counts of murder due to rumours that several of the film's death scenes were real. He was later cleared. United Artists Europa 8/37 The Descent (2005) Directed by: Neil Marshall : Neil Marshall Released in 2005, The Descent follows six women who, upon exploring a cave, battle to survive against the creatures they find inside. It's these creatures that earn this British horror film's placement on this list. Path\u00e9 Distribution 9/37 The Exorcist (1973) Directed by: William Friedkin : William Friedkin One of the most controversial films of all time, The Exorcist \u2013 which tells the story of the demonic possession of a 12-year-old girl named Regan (Linda Blair) \u2013 became the first horror to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars in 1974. Warner Bros 10/37 Halloween (1978) Directed by: John Carpenter : John Carpenter Sure, it may be dated, but John Carpenter's original Halloween film \u2013 released in 1978 \u2013 remains the daddy of all horrors. It re-defined the rule book and has been emulated in everything from Scream (1996) to Trick 'r Treat (2007). The tension, as babysitter Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) attempts to evade masked murderer Michael Myers, only heightens with every new watch. Compass International Pictures[ 11/37 Hereditary (2018) Directed by: Ari Aster : Ari Aster Proving that horror is a force to be reckoned with, Hereditary became independent distributor A24's highest-grossing film around the world upon its release in 2018. It tells the story of a family who find themselves haunted after the death of their secretive grandmother and features a final act that left many of its viewers with sleepless nights. A24 12/37 The House of the Devil (2009) Directed by: Ti West : Ti West The House of the Devil (2009) follows a student named Samantha who is hired to guard an isolated house with one rule: don't go upstairs. For most of the film's runtime, not much happens, which is what makes the action-packed final third so terrifying. Spoiler: she goes upstairs. MPI Media Group 13/37 The Innocents (1961) Directed by: Jack Clayton : Jack Clayton Based upon Henry James' chiller The Turn of the Screw, the plot of 1961 psychological horror film The Innocents concerns a governess who watches over two children and comes to fear that their large estate is haunted by ghosts and that the youngsters are being possessed. 20th Century Fox 14/37 It (1986) Directed by: Tommy Lee Wallace : Tommy Lee Wallace Forget the effects-laden remake \u2013 this version of It, released as a miniseries in 1986, is the most terrifying adaptation of Stephen King's beloved novel to date. It follows a shapeshifting demon who takes the form of a sadistic child-killing clown named Pennywise (Tim Curry). Lorimar Productions 15/37 Ju-On: The Grudge (2002) Directed by: Takashi Shimizu : Takashi Shimizu Japanese horror maestro Takashi Shimizu \u2013 who also directed the pretty scary 2005 remake starring Sarah Michelle Gellar \u2013 balances mystery with horror in Ju-On: The Grudge, a story based in a cursed house in Tokyo. Lions Gate Films 16/37 Kill List (2011) Directed by: Ben Wheatley : Ben Wheatley To describe the horrors of Kill List is to ruin the film's surprises, but let's just say this: the final 20 minutes of Ben Wheatley's violent drama from 2011 features some of the most unsettling scenes in any film from this decade. Optimum Releasing 17/37 Lake Mungo (2008) Directed by: Joel Anderson : Joel Anderson Taking the form of a mockumentary, the little-seen Australian drama Lake Mungo may have received a limited release in 2008, but its story of a family attempting to come to terms with the drowning of their daughter stays with viewers long after. Arclight Films 18/37 Martyrs (2008) Directed by: Pascal Laugier : Pascal Laugier The polarising 2008 film Martyrs, often associated with the New French Extremity movement, is the kind of horror that leaves you needing a shower once the credits roll. It follows a young woman's quest for revenge on the people who kidnapped and tormented her as a child. Anchor Bay Films 19/37 Night of the Living Dead (1968) Directed by: George A Romero : George A Romero Younger viewers may be desensitised by the more extreme horror films to have been released in recent decades, but the scares featured in Romero's Night of the Living Dead \u2013 including the young girl zombie reveal \u2013 remain some of the most chilling committed to celluloid. Continental Distributing 20/37 Nosferatu (1922) Directed by: FW Murnau : FW Murnau Alongside Cesare in The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920), the character of vampire Count Orlok in 1922 film Nosferatu \u2013 played by Mac Schreck \u2013 remains one of the most spine-tingling in cinema history. Film Arts Guild 21/37 The Orphanage (2007) Directed by: JA Bayona : JA Bayona Produced by Guillermo del Toro, this acclaimed 2007 chiller follows the disappearance of a young boy in an orphanage, which brings many of the building's terrifying secrets to the fore. Warner Bros Pictures de Espa\u00f1a 22/37 The Others (2001) Directed by: Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar : Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar The Others (2001) is a towering achievement for Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar who wrote, directed and scored this Nicole Kidman-fronted tale about a woman trying to protect her children from supernatural forces. It's perhaps the scariest 12-certificate film of all time. Warner Sogefilms 23/37 Paranormal Activity (2009) Directed by: Oren Peli : Oren Peli Could Paranormal Activity be the scariest film of all time? It's certainly one of them. Just when you thought found-footage had had its day, Oren Peli's small-budgeted festival favourite became one of 2009's biggest hits. Audiences lapped up the story of a couple who capture supernatural presences on a camera in their own home. Paramount Pictures[ 24/37 Paranormal Activity 3 (2011) Directed by: Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman : Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman Paranormal Activity 3 earns its place on this list for its final 10 minutes. Set 18 years prior to the events of the first two films, we see the cause of the curse that follows characters Katie and Kristi for the rest of their lives \u2013 and it's down to a coven of witches led by their grandmother. Paramount Pictures 25/37 [REC] (2007) Directed by: Jaume Balaguer\u00f3, Paco Plaza : Jaume Balaguer\u00f3, Paco Plaza Played out in real-time, the claustrophobic Spanish horror film [REC] is one of the better examples of found-footage cinema. Released in 2007, it follows a reporter and her cameraman who follow firefighters to a Barcelona building and soon find themselves locked inside with its occupants who are displaying murderous behaviour. Filmax International 26/37 Ring (1998) Directed by: Hideo Nakata : Hideo Nakata Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the story of Ring by now: viewers of a cursed videotape die seven days after watching it. While the inevitable Hollywood remake in 2002 was better than it had any right to be, Nakata's original is as terrifying as horror films come. Toho 27/37 Rosemary's Baby (1968) Directed by: Roman Polanski : Roman Polanski Released in 1968, Rosemary's Baby follows a pregnant woman who suspects that an evil cult want to take her baby for use in their rituals. Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes and Ruth Gordon's performances tip this psychological chiller into classic status. Paramount Pictures 28/37 The Shining (1980) Directed by: Stanley Kubrick : Stanley Kubrick Forget the iconic \"Heeeeere's Johnny\" or that bath scene \u2013 it's the smaller moments that make Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining a terrifying watch, notably the trippy final act that sees Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) lose his mind to the Overlook Hotel. Warner Bros 29/37 Sinister (2012) Directed by: Scott Derrickson : Scott Derrickson Of all the Blumhouse horror films, 2012 release Sinister \u2013 which features the demonic character Bughuul \u2013 is the spookiest of them all. It stars Ethan Hawke as a true-crime writer who discovers a box of home movies depicting grisly murders in the attic of his new house. Momentum Pictures 30/37 Sleep Tight (2011) Directed by: Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 : Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 This little-seen Spanish horror follows a concierge who, believing he was born without the ability to feel happiness, decides to make life hell for everyone around him. Filmax 31/37 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) Directed by: Tobe Hooper : Tobe Hooper The fictional Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), marketed as a true story, follows a group of cannibals \u2013 including Leatherface \u2013 who relentlessly hunt down a group of friends. Vortex 32/37 28 Days Later (2002) Directed by: Danny Boyle : Danny Boyle Many might not reflect upon 28 Days Later (2002) as one of the world's scariest horror films, but its desolate depiction of a viral outbreak seems more real than any other. When merged with the fast-paced infected and the usage of John Murphy's song \"In the House \u2013 In A Heartbeat\", it's hard to deny it such status. Fox Searchlight Pictures 33/37 V/H/S (2012) Directed by: Various : Various Directed by six filmmakers, including Adam Wingard and Ti West, 2012 anthology film V/H/S is grimy horror of the tallest order. Look no further than David Bruckner's section \"Amateur Night\" following three friends who meet a mysterious girl who says nothing other than three small words: \"I like you.\" Magnet Releasing 34/37 The Wailing (2016) Directed by: Na Hong-jin : Na Hong-jin Twist-filled horror drama The Wailing follows a policeman who investigates a series of mysterious killings and illness in the mountains of South Korea. If the journey fails to scare you, its destination will leave you lying awake at night. 20th Century Fox Korea 35/37 The Wicker Man (1973) Directed by: Robin Hardy : Robin Hardy The Wicker Man is deemed the best British horror film of all time for a reason. It tells the story of a Police Sergeant who travels to an isolated island in search of a missing girl, only to find its inhabitants practising a form of Celtic paganism. British Lion Films 36/37 The Witch (2015) Directed by: Robert Eggers : Robert Eggers For the most part, it's not what you see in The Witch that terrifies, it's what you don't see. Eggers unsettlingly holds his camera a fraction too long in places as he retells the story of a Separatist family who encounter supernatural forces in the woods beyond their farm. A24 37/37 Zero Day (2003) Directed by: Ben Coccio : Ben Coccio The horrors are all too real in Zero Day, a film inspired by the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. The majority of the film is portrayed through the video diaries of two students who are planning to attack their high school. Avatar Films 1/37 Funny Games (1997) Directed by: Michael Haneke : Michael Haneke Funny Games places the horror in the familiar setting of home. It follows two young men who hold a family hostage and torture them with sadistic games. The result is far scarier than anything featuring ghosts, witches or demons. Concorde-Castle Rock/Turner 2/37 The Amityville Horror (1979) Directed by: Stuart Rosenberg : Stuart Rosenberg The Amityville Horror is based on the true story of the Lutzes, a family who were run out of their home after being terrorised by paranormal phenomena in 1975. Just one year before, Ronald DeFeo Jr shot and killed six members of his family in the same house. James Brolin and Margot Kidder lead this film, which became one of the biggest hits of 1979. American International Pictures 3/37 Audition (1999) Directed by: Takashi Miike : Takashi Miike Japanese horror Audition (1999) follows a widower who meets a woman named Ayoma after staging auditions to meet a potential new partner. Soon, though, her dark past begins to surface, which equates to a pretty disturbing climax. Omega Project 4/37 The Blair Witch Project (1999) Directed by: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo S\u00e1nchez : Daniel Myrick, Eduardo S\u00e1nchez Although parodied to death, The Blair Witch Project popularised the found-footage format to terrifying degrees in 1999. People genuinely believed they were watching real clips of three student filmmakers being terrorised by a Maryland legend known as the Blair Witch. Artisan Entertainment 5/37 The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) Directed by: Robert Wiene : Robert Wiene Black-and-white silent horror film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) is considered the quintessential work of German Expressionism, but also one of the scariest films in cinema history. It follows a hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist to commit murders, and Wiene's shadowed sets and striking visual style combines to unsettle the viewer in ways most filmmakers only dream of managing. Decla-Bioscop 6/37 Candyman (1992) Directed by: Bernard Rose : Bernard Rose A contemporary classic of horror cinema, 1992 film Candyman \u2013 which spawned two sequels and has a Jordan Peele-produced remake in the works \u2013 follows a graduate student whose studies lead her to the legend of a ghost who appears when you say his name three times. TriStar Pictures 7/37 Cannibal Holocaust (1980) Directed by: Ruggero Deodato : Ruggero Deodato Extreme enough to warrant a ban in Italy and Australia, Cannibal Holocaust (1980) was one of the first films to embrace the found-footage format \u2013 so much so that Deodato found himself charged with multiple counts of murder due to rumours that several of the film's death scenes were real. He was later cleared. United Artists Europa 8/37 The Descent (2005) Directed by: Neil Marshall : Neil Marshall Released in 2005, The Descent follows six women who, upon exploring a cave, battle to survive against the creatures they find inside. It's these creatures that earn this British horror film's placement on this list. Path\u00e9 Distribution 9/37 The Exorcist (1973) Directed by: William Friedkin : William Friedkin One of the most controversial films of all time, The Exorcist \u2013 which tells the story of the demonic possession of a 12-year-old girl named Regan (Linda Blair) \u2013 became the first horror to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars in 1974. Warner Bros 10/37 Halloween (1978) Directed by: John Carpenter : John Carpenter Sure, it may be dated, but John Carpenter's original Halloween film \u2013 released in 1978 \u2013 remains the daddy of all horrors. It re-defined the rule book and has been emulated in everything from Scream (1996) to Trick 'r Treat (2007). The tension, as babysitter Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) attempts to evade masked murderer Michael Myers, only heightens with every new watch. Compass International Pictures[ 11/37 Hereditary (2018) Directed by: Ari Aster : Ari Aster Proving that horror is a force to be reckoned with, Hereditary became independent distributor A24's highest-grossing film around the world upon its release in 2018. It tells the story of a family who find themselves haunted after the death of their secretive grandmother and features a final act that left many of its viewers with sleepless nights. A24 12/37 The House of the Devil (2009) Directed by: Ti West : Ti West The House of the Devil (2009) follows a student named Samantha who is hired to guard an isolated house with one rule: don't go upstairs. For most of the film's runtime, not much happens, which is what makes the action-packed final third so terrifying. Spoiler: she goes upstairs. MPI Media Group 13/37 The Innocents (1961) Directed by: Jack Clayton : Jack Clayton Based upon Henry James' chiller The Turn of the Screw, the plot of 1961 psychological horror film The Innocents concerns a governess who watches over two children and comes to fear that their large estate is haunted by ghosts and that the youngsters are being possessed. 20th Century Fox 14/37 It (1986) Directed by: Tommy Lee Wallace : Tommy Lee Wallace Forget the effects-laden remake \u2013 this version of It, released as a miniseries in 1986, is the most terrifying adaptation of Stephen King's beloved novel to date. It follows a shapeshifting demon who takes the form of a sadistic child-killing clown named Pennywise (Tim Curry). Lorimar Productions 15/37 Ju-On: The Grudge (2002) Directed by: Takashi Shimizu : Takashi Shimizu Japanese horror maestro Takashi Shimizu \u2013 who also directed the pretty scary 2005 remake starring Sarah Michelle Gellar \u2013 balances mystery with horror in Ju-On: The Grudge, a story based in a cursed house in Tokyo. Lions Gate Films 16/37 Kill List (2011) Directed by: Ben Wheatley : Ben Wheatley To describe the horrors of Kill List is to ruin the film's surprises, but let's just say this: the final 20 minutes of Ben Wheatley's violent drama from 2011 features some of the most unsettling scenes in any film from this decade. Optimum Releasing 17/37 Lake Mungo (2008) Directed by: Joel Anderson : Joel Anderson Taking the form of a mockumentary, the little-seen Australian drama Lake Mungo may have received a limited release in 2008, but its story of a family attempting to come to terms with the drowning of their daughter stays with viewers long after. Arclight Films 18/37 Martyrs (2008) Directed by: Pascal Laugier : Pascal Laugier The polarising 2008 film Martyrs, often associated with the New French Extremity movement, is the kind of horror that leaves you needing a shower once the credits roll. It follows a young woman's quest for revenge on the people who kidnapped and tormented her as a child. Anchor Bay Films 19/37 Night of the Living Dead (1968) Directed by: George A Romero : George A Romero Younger viewers may be desensitised by the more extreme horror films to have been released in recent decades, but the scares featured in Romero's Night of the Living Dead \u2013 including the young girl zombie reveal \u2013 remain some of the most chilling committed to celluloid. Continental Distributing 20/37 Nosferatu (1922) Directed by: FW Murnau : FW Murnau Alongside Cesare in The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920), the character of vampire Count Orlok in 1922 film Nosferatu \u2013 played by Mac Schreck \u2013 remains one of the most spine-tingling in cinema history. Film Arts Guild 21/37 The Orphanage (2007) Directed by: JA Bayona : JA Bayona Produced by Guillermo del Toro, this acclaimed 2007 chiller follows the disappearance of a young boy in an orphanage, which brings many of the building's terrifying secrets to the fore. Warner Bros Pictures de Espa\u00f1a 22/37 The Others (2001) Directed by: Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar : Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar The Others (2001) is a towering achievement for Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar who wrote, directed and scored this Nicole Kidman-fronted tale about a woman trying to protect her children from supernatural forces. It's perhaps the scariest 12-certificate film of all time. Warner Sogefilms 23/37 Paranormal Activity (2009) Directed by: Oren Peli : Oren Peli Could Paranormal Activity be the scariest film of all time? It's certainly one of them. Just when you thought found-footage had had its day, Oren Peli's small-budgeted festival favourite became one of 2009's biggest hits. Audiences lapped up the story of a couple who capture supernatural presences on a camera in their own home. Paramount Pictures[ 24/37 Paranormal Activity 3 (2011) Directed by: Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman : Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman Paranormal Activity 3 earns its place on this list for its final 10 minutes. Set 18 years prior to the events of the first two films, we see the cause of the curse that follows characters Katie and Kristi for the rest of their lives \u2013 and it's down to a coven of witches led by their grandmother. Paramount Pictures 25/37 [REC] (2007) Directed by: Jaume Balaguer\u00f3, Paco Plaza : Jaume Balaguer\u00f3, Paco Plaza Played out in real-time, the claustrophobic Spanish horror film [REC] is one of the better examples of found-footage cinema. Released in 2007, it follows a reporter and her cameraman who follow firefighters to a Barcelona building and soon find themselves locked inside with its occupants who are displaying murderous behaviour. Filmax International 26/37 Ring (1998) Directed by: Hideo Nakata : Hideo Nakata Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the story of Ring by now: viewers of a cursed videotape die seven days after watching it. While the inevitable Hollywood remake in 2002 was better than it had any right to be, Nakata's original is as terrifying as horror films come. Toho 27/37 Rosemary's Baby (1968) Directed by: Roman Polanski : Roman Polanski Released in 1968, Rosemary's Baby follows a pregnant woman who suspects that an evil cult want to take her baby for use in their rituals. Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes and Ruth Gordon's performances tip this psychological chiller into classic status. Paramount Pictures 28/37 The Shining (1980) Directed by: Stanley Kubrick : Stanley Kubrick Forget the iconic \"Heeeeere's Johnny\" or that bath scene \u2013 it's the smaller moments that make Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining a terrifying watch, notably the trippy final act that sees Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) lose his mind to the Overlook Hotel. Warner Bros 29/37 Sinister (2012) Directed by: Scott Derrickson : Scott Derrickson Of all the Blumhouse horror films, 2012 release Sinister \u2013 which features the demonic character Bughuul \u2013 is the spookiest of them all.

Avatar Films\n\nThe World Fantasy Awards redesign has been almost universally welcomed. Ramsey Campbell, a doyen of British horror who has made his own contributions to the mythos, agrees that the feelings of authors should be respected.\n\n\u201cI was a judge at the first World Fantasy Awards back in 1975,\u201d he says. \u201cKirby McCauley was my agent, and he was also one of the main organisers of the World Fantasy Convention, and responsible for choosing Lovecraft as the basis of the award. Since then I\u2019ve received several, and eventually the Lifetime Award, which was in fact the last year that used Lovecraft\u2019s image. I was and am proud to have them, not least because my old friend Gahan Wilson designed them with his typical dark humour.\n\n\u201cThat said, I can understand why some candidates could feel offended or hurt by being considered for an award named for someone so dismissive of their race, and I wonder how I\u2019d feel if I were one of them. On balance I think an award should give pleasure to the recipients, and so perhaps a neutral image is safer.\u201d\n\nLovecraft died in 1937 at the age of 46. He was impoverished and utterly obscure. Decades would elapse before his stock would rise. One major catalyst was Sandy Petersen\u2019s 1981 role-playing game Call of Cthulhu, which celebrated the pulpier elements of Lovecraft and cultivated a new generation of fans. Ever since, the cult has grown and grown.\n\n\u201cI like the fact that he\u2019s dealing with something big and unknown and I like the mythos as an example of world-building,\u201d says Julian Simpson. \u201cHe\u2019s like dark Tolkien for me: a whole universe of horrors conjured from one person\u2019s pen.\u201d\n\n\u201cLovecraft\u2019s enduring popularity can seem strange, especially given that he had only modest literary success in his lifetime,\u201d adds James Lovegrove. \u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s a collective in-joke more than anything. People randomly alighted on a particular author who was fairly obscure and whose prose style was ungainly, to say the least, and decided to collaborate on making him posthumously famous by sharing, developing and expanding on his canon.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s a needlessly cynical view he feels. \u201cMore likely it\u2019s the case that Lovecraft just hit on something, something universal that we all feel \u2013 a fear of unknown forces, a sense that in a world where capital-G God has lost much of His meaning and religion is used mostly for social control and fleecing its adherents, the only thing that makes sense is chaos.\u201d\n\nColour Out of Space screens at the Prince Charles Cinema, Leicester Place, 7 October, 8.30pm.
