How to put on a jacket. How to tie our shoes. How to blow a bubble with our gum and snap our fingers. (OK, those last two might not really be \u201clife skills,\u201d but they\u2019re important, nonetheless.) And yet, they\u2019re kind of hard to teach.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, to whistle, you just kind of purse your lips like this and, I don\u2019t know, sort of blow air through the opening... no, more slowly than that... purse your lips a little more, maybe... eh, you\u2019ll figure it out at some point,\u201d we say.\n\nOne such life skill we can\u2019t wait around for them to figure out on their own, though, is how to blow their noses. Because snotty noses are gross and we are not interested in wiping them forever.\n\nThis tip comes from Today\u2019s Parent and was part of a 30-part slideshow full of back-to-school hacks. But really, this one is an all-year-round hack: Teach them with a cotton ball.\n\n1. Familiarise her with the idea of blowing air out of her nose by getting her to move a cotton ball with only nose air (keeping her mouth closed). 2. Now she\u2019s ready to try with a tissue. Have her gently press one nostril closed while she blows with the other, then switch sides. 3. Have her dispose of her tissue once she\u2019s done and wash her hands to prevent the spread of germs.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have cotton balls handy, you could also try putting a clean tissue on a table and have them practice blowing out of their nose to move the tissue. Hell, make a game out of it by racing to see who can blow the tissue across the table the fastest.\n\nOnce they\u2019re proficient at that, you can get back to teaching them how to whistle.", "description": "There are so many little life skills that we, as adults, have managed to master over the years.
