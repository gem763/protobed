Sign up here.\n\nChina has added almost 100 tons of gold to its reserves since it resumed buying in December, with the consistent run of accumulation coming amid a rally in prices and the drag of the trade war with Washington.\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China raised bullion holdings to 62.45 million ounces in August from 62.26 million a month earlier, according to data on its website at the weekend. In tonnage terms, August\u2019s inflow was 5.91 tons, following the addition of about 94 tons in the previous eight months.\n\nBullion is near a six-year high as central banks including the Federal Reserve cut interest rates as signs of a slowdown mount amid the U.S.-China trade war. Central-bank purchases have been another key support for prices as authorities from China to Russia accumulate significant quantities of bullion to help diversify their reserves. That buying spree likely to persist in the coming years, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.\n\nTrade war restrictions, in the case of China, or sanctions, as with Russia, give \u201can incentive for these central banks to diversify,\u201d John Sharma, an economist at National Australia Bank Ltd., said in an email. \u201cAlso, with increasing political and economic uncertainty prevailing, gold provides an ideal hedge, and will therefore be sought after by central banks globally.\u201d\n\nChina has previously gone long periods without revealing increases in gold holdings. When the central bank announced a 57% jump in reserves to 53.3 million ounces in mid-2015, it was the first update in six years.\n\nSpot gold rose 0.2% to $1,510.27 an ounce on Monday. Prices, which capped a fourth straight monthly gains in August, have risen 18% this year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BNP Paribas SA are among banks that expect the metal to challenge $1,600 an ounce within the coming months.\n\n(Adds comment in fourth paragraph; price in sixth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Emma Dong.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ranjeetha Pakiam in Singapore at rpakiam@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.net, Jake Lloyd-Smith, Keith Gosman\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
