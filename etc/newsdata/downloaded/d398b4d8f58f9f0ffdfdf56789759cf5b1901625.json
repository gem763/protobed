Our chief negotiator Michel Barnier and I are doing everything we can to reach an agreement. If this fails in the end, the responsibility lies solely with the British side.\u201d\n\nThe two negotiating sides are wide apart on the fundamentals of how to deal with the problem of the Irish border, and there is growing and grave scepticism that the government will be able to produce anything reasonable for leaders to sign off on at a crunch summit on 17 October.\n\nThe UK has insisted that Northern Ireland cannot be \u201cleft behind\u201d in the EU\u2019s single market and shared customs territory, nor can the whole of the UK be \u201ctrapped\u201d in the bloc\u2019s structures simply to avoid a hard border.\n\nBarclay emphasised in a recent speech in Madrid that any deal must recognise that there will be two regulatory zones on the island of Ireland. The government insists that controls and checks on trade through the border can be done in a light-touch way to ensure there is no infrastructure or huge changes to the local economy.\n\nThe EU has said that, as yet, there does not appear to be any solution beyond Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland remaining in regulatory alignment. \u201cWhat they are proposing is for us to ignore huge blocks of EU law \u2013 make massive derogations for them,\u201d a source said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nOn the eve of his meeting with Barclay, Barnier told EU ambassadors that the proposals so far tabled by the UK were not workable. He reiterated that time was running out, adding in an aside that the dramatic scenes in Westminster did not offer much confidence that a majority for any deal could be found.\n\nQuick guide Why is the Irish border a stumbling block for Brexit? Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. Early drafts of the agreement Britain hoped to get signed off on Monday said there would be \u201cno divergence\u201d from EU rules that \u201csupport north-south cooperation\u201d, later changed to \u201ccontinued alignment\u201d in a formulation that appeared to allow for subtle divergences. But it raised new questions about who would oversee it and how disputes might be resolved. It was also clearly still a step too far for the DUP. Photograph: Design Pics Inc/Design Pics RF\n\n\u201cBut the biggest obstacle to a deal remains the absence until now of serious, workable proposals,\u201d a source said.\n\nSeveral EU diplomats told Barnier that the UK would have to table \u201cserious\u201d plans to replace the Irish backstop by the end of next week \u2013 immediately after the Conservative party conference in Manchester.\n\n\u201cThe clock is ticking, after that, time would be in too short supply,\u201d an EU diplomat said.\n\nBut the person added that the mood around the table was \u201chighly sceptical\u201d that it will be possible to agree a deal, also because of the \u201cpolitical situation\u201d in London.\n\nIf the UK fails to produce proposals within the next seven days, EU diplomats say their governments will not have enough time to assess the politically sensitive and deeply technical issues at stake.\n\nThe pessimistic mood deepened after the UK presented earlier this week its latest discussion paper on breaking the backstop deadlock - a six-page document on moving food, animal and plant products between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as part of a plan for an all-Ireland agri food zone.\n\nEU diplomats are unhappy that the UK seems to be picking holes in the logic of the EU\u2019s strict rules on food, animal and plant safety (sanitary and phytosanitary measures). \u201cIf you are staying in our SPS zone you don\u2019t get to start second guessing the logic of it,\u201d said one source, describing the mood. \u201cI sense an extra frustration. There is a bit of a \u2018how dare you\u2019 kind of line.\u201d\n\nVoicing his frustrations, Barnier told the diplomats the UK was \u201cbasically asking us to organise shortfalls and imperfections at our border\u201d.\n\nWhile EU diplomats were focused on technical talks, many have been aghast at the UK prime minister\u2019s performance in the Commons on Wednesday night. EU officials feel Johnson and his ministers have burned bridges with Labour and one-nation Tories. \u201cHow do you get to a point where if magically you get to a deal at the European council, you are able to get the Commons to vote it through?\u201d asked a source.\n\n\u201cThere was very little talk of recent developments in Westminster, if only to note that it seemed increasingly difficult to see how the government would obtain a majority for a deal, given the divisions getting more entrenched by the day,\u201d a second diplomat added.\n\nWhen asked if Johnson had ever lied about the EU, a spokeswoman for the European commission said: \u201cI think President Juncker himself has said in a number of interviews, without referring to Prime Minister Johnson himself, but referring to events related to the brexit referendum campaign has said he should have intervened because a lot of untruths were told back then.\n\n\u201cHe would have been quite busy correcting all these untruths every day but he was not referring specifically to Prime Minister Johnson with whom he has a constructive exchange but indeed it does matter that we all stay true to the facts as much as possible.\u201d", "description": "Both sides still far apart over Irish border while Commons hostility dismays EU", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73703a06fda856c7511e870c49f6a47a6dbe2797/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=383b5ddf70fd7a3f4690d45b768f133b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
