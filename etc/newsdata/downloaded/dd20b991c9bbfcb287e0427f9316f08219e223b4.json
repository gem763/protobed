Schiff?", "language": "en", "text": "House Minority Whip Steve Scalise asks an excellent question: \u201cWhat is Adam Schiff trying to hide?\u201d\n\nSchiff \u2014 the point man for impeachment \u2014 could at least try to explain why he\u2019s holding all his hearings behind closed doors, with the public getting only leaked, and likely biased, accounts of the testimony.\n\nTo dramatize the problem Wednesday, 30 House Republicans stormed into the room that was to host Schiff\u2019s next secret hearing. The chairman responded by leaving, postponing the testimony of Defense Department official Laura Cooper.\n\nSchiff notes that GOP members of the three committees handling the inquiry are free to attend the hearings, and ask questions. But he has yet to offer any good reason why they can\u2019t also call witnesses, or why nothing is happening in public.\n\nYou have to wonder if he, and/or Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are just determined to avoid any more complete debacles such as the testimony of former special counsel Bob Mueller.\n\nIf the public can\u2019t see for itself that a given witness actually weakens the case for impeaching President Trump, then it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 Democrats can still march out and tell the press the testimony was damning.\n\nRepublicans may say the reverse \u2014 but in a he-said/she-said, the media is guaranteed to maximize any hit against the president.\n\nSchiff could cite the need to protect classified information as a reason to keep part of some hearings out of the public eye, but he hasn\u2019t \u2014 and most testimony plainly doesn\u2019t qualify.\n\nPerhaps Pelosi and Schiff just don\u2019t care: They get to set the rules; Republicans are helpless to stop them (hence their resort to Wednesday\u2019s stunt). And the polls show rising support for impeaching Trump and removing him from office \u2014 at least among Democrats and independents. Republican voters, it seems, remain unswayed.\n\nBut Democrats can\u2019t keep things secret forever. And then it\u2019s up to the American people to decide whether this amounts to a mountain \u2014 or a molehill.", "description": "You have to wonder if he, and/or Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are just determined to avoid any more complete debacles such as the testimony of former special counsel Bob Mueller.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/usa_maguire_testify-2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
