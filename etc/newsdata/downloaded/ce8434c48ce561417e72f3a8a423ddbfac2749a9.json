We couldn't get the one we wanted.\"", "description": "Man Utd were reportedly not keen to try and sign Neymar due to a number of concerns surrounding the Brazilian", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20326268.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ligue-1-Bordeaux-v-Paris-St-Germain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
