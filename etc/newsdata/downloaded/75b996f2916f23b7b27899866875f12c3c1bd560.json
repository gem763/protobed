It\u2019s time to talk about the insidious effect it has on women who suffer a miscarriage early in their pregnancy.\n\nAn estimated 650 babies are miscarried every day in the UK, with the vast majority occurring during the first trimester. Most of these losses will be suffered in silence, because it\u2019s considered so socially unacceptable to reveal that you\u2019re pregnant before 12 weeks \u2013 let alone that you were pregnant, but now you\u2019re not. It\u2019s baffling that in 2019 we seem so wedded to an anachronistic superstition about tempting fate that shames women into keeping quiet and heaps blame on the woman who dares to \u201ctell\u201d and subsequently loses her baby \u2013 as though we were still in a bygone era where the stigma of miscarrying could mark you out as cursed. Social mores around the 12-week rule are brimming with contradictions: it\u2019s fine to broadcast the minutiae of our daily lives on Instagram, yet disclosing that we\u2019re pregnant, even just to close friends and family, is somehow transgressive.\n\nHow a pioneering study of child health has influenced a generation of parents | Juliet Rix Read more\n\nAs a result, the first trimester is a sort of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s pregnancy: you\u2019re legitimately pregnant when it comes to dos and don\u2019ts such as taking folic acid, but if you miscarry you\u2019re often told that it wasn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d pregnancy anyway. Before I went to the operating theatre to have my dead baby surgically removed from my uterus, a nurse remarked that until the invention of home pregnancy tests, most women probably wouldn\u2019t have known they were pregnant at that stage, and would have assumed their miscarriage was a heavy period.\n\nWhile it\u2019s certainly thanks to modern ultrasound technology that my husband and I had seen our baby\u2019s beautiful heartbeat twice before I miscarried, a host of early pregnancy symptoms and having to pass a not-insubstantial gestational sac would probably have tipped me off.\n\nWe\u2019re often told that miscarriages are no big deal because they\u2019re really common; so is divorce, but you don\u2019t often hear anyone say, \u201cSorry your husband left you \u2013 but it\u2019s really common, and you can always get married again.\u201d Yet for something so common, it can feel so incredibly lonely, precisely because the 12-week rule perpetuates the notion that early pregnancy loss is something to hide and we shouldn\u2019t make a fuss.\n\nThis establishes a hierarchy of grief determined by the stage of gestation, that glibly dismisses early miscarriages as \u201cjust a ball of cells\u201d, deeming only later losses worthy of mourning. But the meaning of any pregnancy is deeply personal, and we can\u2019t neatly fit the impact of losing it in its own discrete box. Ellie Jesky experienced miscarriages on both sides of the 12-week line. \u201cThe moment you get that positive test, however much you know that it\u2019s precarious and that things can go wrong, it\u2019s your baby,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou plan and imagine what their life will be like. And then when that\u2019s totally ripped away in an instant it\u2019s a genuine loss, regardless of how far along.\u201d\n\nThe 12-week rule perpetuates the notion that early pregnancy loss is something to hide and we shouldn\u2019t make a fuss.\n\nThe consequence of this culture of secrecy and lack of compassionate discussion is that many women grieve for their miscarriages in the shadows, weighed down by heavy feelings of guilt and failure. Desperate for answers beyond unsatisfactory explanations such as \u201cit\u2019s just one of those things\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s nature\u2019s way\u201d, or \u201cit wasn\u2019t meant to be\u201d, we\u2019ll seize upon any excuse to blame ourselves. Most early losses are due to chromosomal abnormalities; but according to Prof Arri Coomarasamy, director of Tommy\u2019s National Centre for Miscarriage Research, fewer than half of women who suffer repeated miscarriages ever find out why.\n\nThe decision about how, when and if we share our experiences of fertility, pregnancy and loss should be a personal choice, not an enforced obligation. Miscarriage will always be a sad reality in many people\u2019s lives, but greater understanding and empathy could alleviate much of this pain.\n\nWe\u2019re starting to see more open discussion around miscarriage in public discourse. I\u2019m hopeful that the more comfortably we can each own our story the more we\u2019ll feel empowered to seek support when we suffer losses at any stage of pregnancy. \u201cEven if we can\u2019t cure miscarriage,\u201d says Dr Jessica Zucker, a psychologist specialising in women\u2019s reproductive health and creator of the #IHadaMiscarriage campaign, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we at least attempt to cure the conversation?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Katy Lindemann is author of a forthcoming book that shares real women\u2019s stories about the emotional experience of infertility and pregnancy loss", "description": "The secrecy around early pregnancy means that many women grieve in private, weighed down by feelings of guilt and failure, says author Katy Lindemann", "authors": ["Katy Lindemann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd86f1655a23df209701419118297198c0635e4c/0_302_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0aede9f8ac49ffc0bd4e326c0bd09b1e", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
