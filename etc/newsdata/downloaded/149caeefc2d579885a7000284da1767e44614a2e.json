And well\u2026 they aren\u2019t too dissimilar.\n\nWhen the Croatian was seen for the first time this season in that Carabao Cup third round tie amongst a shadow side in Buckinghamshire 10 days earlier, he did so with something of the Ghost of Christmas Past about him.\n\nMK Dons were viewed as perfect opponents to give Joe Gomez match practice just in case anything happened to Joel Matip, the man who has risen to the rank of Virgil van Dijk\u2019s deputy. Lovren was just there .\n\nHe could just as easily not have been. Summer moves to AC Milan and Roma were discussed but never materialised, as a shift in many fans\u2019 perceptions saw the Croatian enter the territory of yesterday\u2019s news.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLovren hasn\u2019t actually done anything majorly wrong for a while, it\u2019s just that the performances of Gomez in the first half of last season and Matip in the second had overshadowed him.\n\nThis coupled with his frequent and baffling absences through illness had stretched patience, while the exits of Simon Mignolet and Alberto Moreno meant that the finger of past disappointments had to be pointed at someone new.\n\nYou can only get a certain amount of leeway for being Mo Salah\u2019s best mate after all, and such is Lovren\u2019s life that he\u2019ll always be the man many first look for on the scene of even the most minor defensive crime.\n\n(Image: Wyscout)\n\nCould he have got tighter to Sergio Aguero in January? If he had would Aguero have scored? If Aguero hadn\u2019t scored would Liverpool have won the league? These are the fine, ridiculous margins the brilliant top two are dealing with, as any blip feels catastrophic.\n\nBut while Gomez looked rusty and sometimes a little passive against Red Bull Salzburg on Wednesday, one thing you can never accuse Lovren of is being backward in coming forward.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nIn hindsight, the clue that he would play came in Klopp\u2019s pre-match press conference on Friday, when the German launched into the latest of what have been many auditions to be named Jamie Vardy\u2019s biggest fan.\n\n\u201cIn general he is an incredible player, for years already, and if he gets the service he will be a proper threat and we have to make sure that will not happen that often,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know about his speed obviously, but it is more about timing, so we need to be in the right place at the right moment to defend him. There is no alternative to that.\u201d\n\n(Image: Wyscout)\n\nNo alternative, and so no doubt in Klopp\u2019s mind that he was going to prefer the front foot, aggressive defending of Lovren over Gomez\u2019s better ability on the ball and speed on the cover.\n\nFor Lovren the job was to snuff out the Vardy problem before it became one, and more often than not he did that.\n\nIn a throwback to the latter half of his 2017/18 season when he helped Liverpool to the Kiev Champions League final, the Croatian made eight clearances and won five of six aerial duels, and while Vardy did get in once he was already struggling for space as Adrian came out to block.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI have never seen a team defend Jamie Vardy better than today,\u201d said Klopp after his side\u2019s 2-1 win, and he\u2019s such a fan of Vardy that you\u2019d imagine he\u2019s watched a lot of them.\n\nLovren was a key part of that effort, and while fortune might have smiled on the Reds at one end, his efforts at the other deserve highlighting.\n\nHe\u2019ll bow out for Matip or maybe even Gomez at Old Trafford in two weeks\u2019 time, but this was a reminder of how much he absolutely loves a battle, and how that can still be of use to Klopp.", "description": "Dejan Lovren proved Jurgen Klopp right as Liverpool kept Jamie Vardy quiet in their dramatic win over Leicester", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Wyscout", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20517195.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
