But we will WIN!\" Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the impeachment inquiry here in the Democratic-led House of Representatives focusing on his request that Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival, Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nLynching refers to the murder of thousands of Americans, most of them black, between the 1880s and 1960s, as African-Americans struggled for their rights as U.S. citizens in the aftermath of the Civil War in which Southern states fought in vain to maintain black slavery.\n\n\u201cThe president should not compare a constitutionally mandated impeachment inquiry to such a dangerous and dark chapter of American history. It\u2019s irresponsible for him to do so, and I hope that he will apologize,\u201d said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, who is black.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said, \u201cGiven the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching. That was an unfortunate choice of words.\u201d McConnell added that he viewed the House inquiry as \u201can unfair process\u201d that is denying Trump \u201cprocedural safeguards.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and other critics have previously accused Trump of stoking racial divisions while trying to appeal to his largely white core of conservative Republican voters, noting his comment in 2017 that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d at a rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia in which a counter-protester was killed.\n\nSome Republican allies agreed with Trump\u2019s use of the word lynching.\n\n\u201cIt shows a lot of things about our national media. When it\u2019s about Trump, who cares about the process, as long as you get him. So, yeah, this is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, whose home state of South Carolina has a large black population, told reporters.\n\nTrump has a long and controversial history on race including decades-old allegations of discrimination in his family\u2019s real estate business. He also championed the death penalty for five black and Latino teens wrongly accused of raping a white woman in 1989 in New York\u2019s Central Park, used an expletive to describe African countries in 2018, and singled out black athletes for criticism after they failed to stand for the national anthem while protesting racial inequity.\n\n\u2018HISTORICAL TRAGEDIES\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s lynching comment was immediately condemned by critics as unbecoming of a president.\n\n\u201cFor him to say something like that was disgusting, reflects his insensitivity toward the historical tragedies of this country,\u201d said Representative Barbara Lee, who said she was not surprised or shocked by Trump\u2019s comments but \u201cjust very, very disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Trump to characterize a legal impeachment inquiry as a lynching shows a complete disrespect for the thousands of Black people lynched - murdered - throughout our nation\u2019s history in acts of racism and hatred,\u201d said Karen Baynes-Dunning, interim president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which advocates for equal opportunity and fights bigotry.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is focused on Trump\u2019s request during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he investigate a domestic political rival, former vice president Joe Biden. Biden is a leading contender to become the Democratic 2020 presidential nominee to run against Trump.\n\nBiden said on Twitter that Trump\u2019s use of the word was \u201cabhorrent\u201d and \u201cdespicable.\u201d\n\nBiden, however, said in 1998 the impeachment of President Bill Clinton could be seen as a \u201cpartisan lynching.\u201d Biden apologized in a tweet late on Tuesday, saying it \u201cwasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d\n\nSenator Tim Scott, the only black Republican U.S. senator and one of just two black Republicans in Congress, said of Trump\u2019s comment, \u201cI get his absolute rejection of the process,\u201d but said he would not use the word lynching. Scott, like Graham, represents South Carolina.\n\nRepublican Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor who ran in the party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination contest won by Trump, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe President is not a victim. He should be the most powerful person on the planet. To equate his plight to lynching is grotesque.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 21, 2019.
