Macquarie warned this reflected high levels of outstanding claims. \"It's important to see this stabilise or reduce,\" the bank said.\n\nIt is hard to track CIMIC's cash flows because the company does not reveal which of its projects go over budget, how much it claims for extra costs on specific projects, or what claims are successful. Construction, which accounts for 44 per cent of CIMIC's business, suffered a surprise 15 per cent fall in profit in the six months to June to $268.8 million.\n\nBut CIMIC is increasingly delaying paying the people that help it build projects, such as electricians and technical specialists, raising questions over whether it has enough cash coming in the door.\n\nCIMIC's subsidiary UGL, which was acquired in a hostile takeover in 2016, this month announced it would extend its payment terms from one month to more than two months.\n\nUGL wrote a letter to suppliers and sub-contractors on September 12, telling them that as of October 15, they would not be paid for at least 65 days from the end of the month in which they invoiced the construction group for completed work.\n\nUGL said the 65-day period would not apply to projects governed by the 2016 Building Code, which applies to Commonwealth projects and requires compliance with state and territory security of payment laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it will apply to suppliers \u2013 who typically expect to be paid within 30 days \u2013 working on non-Commonwealth projects in states that don't specify payment time frames.\n\nNSW has some of the toughest regulations, with the state moving to maximum 20-day payment terms from 30 days from October 21.\n\nOther states and territories permit sub-contractors to be paid on any date prescribed by contracts, although WA has a maximum of 42 days and the North Territory a maximum of 50 days.\n\nUGL told suppliers that if they want to be paid earlier than 65 days, they can approach finance group Greensill Capital but that their invoices would not be paid in full because they would have to accept an unspecified discount.\n\nCIMIC describes this practice of early payment, which is known as \"reverse factoring,\" as \"an innovative solution\" that optimises cash flow.\n\nBut the UGL delays could hurt the company's ability to win future government projects.\n\nThe Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ABSFEO) released a statement on Friday saying it was concerned by UGL's shift to 65-day payments and that government should \"stop doing business\" with any company that fails to pay their suppliers and sub-contractors within 20 days.\n\nUGL has been awarded more than 20 Commonwealth government contracts in 2019, according to ABSFEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCIMIC is not a signatory to the Business Council of Australia's supplier payment code, which commits to paying suppliers within 30 days, and has been paying its suppliers in 60 days, according to an ABSFEO report on payment practices released in March.\n\nRival engineering and construction group Lendlease does comply with the BCA code.\n\nAnalysts don't like reverse factoring because it obscures companies' real cash flows. Hong Kong-based GMT Research raised concerns in May over CIMIC's use of reverse factoring and traditional factoring, which involves the construction group sending invoices to third parties and, for a fee, getting paid most of the invoice in advance.\n\nIt believes the upcoming payment changes by UGL could suggest the company is increasing its levels of reverse factoring, providing an additional boost to cash flows.\n\nCIMIC disclosed for the first time in its half year results that its use of traditional factoring had risen to almost $2 billion, but GMT believes these figures do not include reverse factoring, which the company treats as normal payables rather than debt.\n\nConsequently, it is unclear how much of CIMIC\u2019s cash flow is from operations and how much is from financial engineering, according to GMT, which wants the construction group to disclose the amounts outstanding under reverse-factoring facilities.\n\nACS chairman Florentino Perez told analysts in August the Spanish group had been rolling factoring out \"across the group\" through Hochtief, CIMIC's controlling German shareholder, to \"more efficiently manage cash flows and match revenues and costs along the year\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nACS disclosed in its half year results that it had \u20ac63.8 million n ($104 million) in reverse factoring transactions with suppliers across its global companies, up from \u20ac57.2 million at the end of December 2018. But it does not break out reverse factoring for individual companies.\n\nCIMIC chief executive Marcelino Fernandez Verdes, who is also CEO of Hochtief, has said that the construction group was using factoring to help manage a shift towards more \"alliance-style\" contracts, which pay contractors throughout the project rather than giving them big up-front payments (as is the case in fixed-price contracts, which shift the risk of design and construction onto the contractor).\n\nCIMIC was awarded alliance-style contracts worth about $2.5 billion in 2018, according to the company.\n\nCIMIC chairman Marcelino Fernandez Verdes says the company is using more \"factoring\" because it is shifting towards alliance-style contracts. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nBut Bechtel's general manager of Asian Pacific infrastructure, Ailie MacAdam, last week told an Infrastructure Partnerships Australia conference in Sydney that while governments were coming up with more risk-sharing models like NSW's 10-point plan, more collaborative arrangements were not yet evident in tender proposals.\n\nCIMIC's quarterly results on October 23 will be the next opportunity for investors to probe the company on its earnings and cash flows.\n\nMorningstar, which believes $35 is \"fair value\" for CIMIC's stock, has welcomed the recent spate of new contract announcements but says the company's work-in-hand needs to rise at a compound annual growth rate of 9 per cent to meet the research group's revenue projections of $22.4 billion by 2023. CIMIC's work-in-hand growth rate since mid-2106 has only been 3.3 per cent.\n\nIt has also warned that CIMIC's transparency on individual contracts and projects remains low and there is the potential for future big projects to incur significant losses from \"unforseen risks.\"\n\njwiggins@afr.com", "description": "CIMIC's increasing use of \"reverse factoring\" to pay suppliers is worrying analysts and the small business ombudsman.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3662%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_436%2C$y_577/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fd049e44c3c3830833b24830cdf031f1fb0036ee", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
