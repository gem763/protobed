He failed to throw a touchdown pass and had two interceptions.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nBurrow will hope to find redemption in the Bayou come the weekend.", "description": "LSU Tigers quarterback Joe Burrow had some harsh words for the Florida Gators ahead of their pivotal conference matchup Saturday.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
