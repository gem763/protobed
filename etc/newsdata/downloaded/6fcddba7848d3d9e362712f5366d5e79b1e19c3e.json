In May Jess and Dom announced that they were expecting their first child, seven months after they tied the knot in October 2018\n\nRhesus disease is a condition where antibodies in a pregnant woman\u2019s blood destroy her baby's blood cells.\n\nIt only happens when the mother has rhesus-negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus-positive blood (RhD positive). The mother must have also been previously sensitised to RhD-positive blood.\n\nThe honey-blonde beauty explained: 'I didn't know it was a thing until recently and it can cause miscarriages. I wanted to make sure everything was good with the baby and it also gave us a bit of time to enjoy it together.'\n\nCandid: In an interview with new! magazine in May, the stunning model explained and her husband why they decided to wait five months until sharing the news of their pregnancy\n\nWHAT IS RHESUS DISEASE? Rhesus disease is a condition where antibodies in a pregnant woman\u2019s blood destroy her baby's blood cells. It only happens when the mother has rhesus-negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus-positive blood (RhD positive). The mother must have also been previously sensitised to RhD-positive blood. Sensitisation happens when a woman with RhD negative blood is exposed to RhD positive blood, usually during a pregnancy with an RhD positive baby. The woman\u2019s body responds to the RhD positive blood by producing antibodies (infection-fighting molecules) that recognise the foreign blood cells and destroy them. If sensitisation occurs, the next time the woman is exposed to RhD positive blood her body will produce antibodies immediately. If she is pregnant with an RhD-positive baby, the antibodies can cross the placenta, causing rhesus disease in the unborn baby. The antibodies can continue attacking the baby's red blood cells for a few months after birth. Rhesus disease does not harm the mother, but it can cause the baby to become anaemic and develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes).
