In their discussions, they also nixed an infographic format that would have framed the impeachment as a sort of flowchart or choose-your-own-adventure scenario. (\u201cToo many confusing possibilities,\u201d Delbanco said.)\n\nThe part of the article that went through the most rewrites, Delbanco told me, was three paragraphs that describe what prompted the impeachment inquiry. \u201cWe are incredibly cautious to make sure that we are unbiased \u2026 I mean, everybody says that, obviously,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will say, in a classroom setting, it really does feel like an absolute do-or-die, to make sure that we convey that in everything we do. We have to hear from many audiences: students, teachers, parents, district leaders and school superintendents, and principals.\u201d Time for Kids has received complaints from the aforementioned groups about coverage Delbanco herself found to be \u201cbenign\u201d\u2014such as articles that treat climate change and evolution as scientific facts. Time for Kids has lost readers over such statements, she told me.\n\nAnother important objective for editors of a children\u2019s publication is to find a way to be factually correct and age-appropriate without infantilizing readers. That means no unnecessary exclamation points and no dismissive, hand-wavey oversimplification, even on particularly hairy subjects. \u201cOne of the things we know absolutely is that if we talked down to our readers, we\u2019d lose them. We are trying to gain their respect,\u201d Delbanco said, \u201cby treating them like future citizens of the world.\u201d\n\nEvery major news story has a threshold at which Delbanco knows Time for Kids will have to cover it. Many stories never get there, but impeachment unavoidably did. \u201cSo much of what we\u2019re trying to do is demystify these things that kids might overhear or see something about on the news\u2014at a restaurant when they\u2019re sitting below a TV, or wherever it might be,\u201d Delbanco said. \u201cSo we\u2019re always looking ahead. When is that moment\u2014when is the critical mass going to shift?\u201d\n\nAnd the impeachment story line, she noted, could be a particularly confusing one for people who are just starting to understand how Congress and the presidency work: \u201cWe know that kids are going to immediately hear impeachment and think it means that in the next week, we\u2019re going to have to have a new president, and not totally understand.\u201d\n\nWhile impeachment was difficult to cover, it\u2019s far from the hardest story Delbanco and her team have had to synthesize in recent memory. Time for Kids historically has not covered school shootings, but in 2018, it included an article about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Delbanco said she thought the incident, and in particular the student-led movement for school safety that grew out of it, presented an opportunity to cover a grim story with a certain degree of hope. The resulting article focused on how the teenage survivors were meeting with legislators and forcing a broader conversation about school safety; an insert in the prior week\u2019s issue gave teachers a heads-up that the story was forthcoming.", "description": "When explosive political allegations arise, Time for Kids is there to translate them for young audiences.", "authors": ["Ashley Fetters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/trump_clinton/facebook.jpg?1569877433", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
