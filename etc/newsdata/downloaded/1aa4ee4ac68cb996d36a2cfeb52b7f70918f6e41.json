Ideally, Lee wants the movie shown in theaters at that frame rate, on a 4K projector, and in 3D.\n\nTheaters in the US can\u2019t handle all those elements at the same time. The closest is 120 fps on a 2K projector in 3D, which is available at 14 theaters.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you have to ask, \u2018Is a guest willing to pay more for this experience because it\u2019s so cutting edge?'\u201d one theater owner offering \u201cGemini Man\u201d at a high frame rate, who asked to speak anonymously, told Business Insider. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has risen to that level yet.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the strain put on the theater of having to show a movie of that size. One source at a theater chain showing \u201cGemini Man\u201d at a high frame rate told Business Insider the projectionist had to deal with the movie crashing while doing tests.\n\n\u201cBut all those things are capable of being overcome, assuming that there is an appetite for this type of format in watching movies,\u201d Russell Vannorsdel, the vice president of the Iowa-based chain Fridley Theatres, told Business Insider.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nThe director Ang Lee is determined to give you a specific experience at the movies, even if it\u2019s impossible.\n\nThe two-time best-director Oscar winner (\u201cLife of Pi\u201d and \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d) has been on a quest of sorts recently: getting audiences and Hollywood to appreciate high frame rates as much as he does.\n\nThe standard movie is shot at 24 frames per second. But Lee made his latest movie, \u201cGemini Man\u201d (in theaters Friday), in the extremely sharp and ultrarealistic high frame rate of 120 frames per second. He also shot it digitally and for 3D.\n\nThat might sound great for the viewer, but collectively, those elements cause a major challenge. In fact, not a single theater in the US can play \u201cGemini Man\u201d the way Lee wants it seen: 120 fps on a high-resolution 4K projector in 3D.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Lee has been in this situation. His previous movie, 2016\u2019s \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk,\u201d was also shot at a high frame rate of 120 fps and could not be seen in 4K and 3D because \u2013 as is still the case today \u2013 no theater in the US had the capabilities.\n\ncaption Will Smith in \u201cGemini Man.\u201d source Paramount\n\nSo if theaters can\u2019t show Lee\u2019s work in the way he intends it to be seen, why is he so determined to continue making his movies this way?\n\n\u201cMy dream is, I hope this movie [will] do some business and other filmmakers join in and we develop this thing,\u201d Lee told Collider.\n\nBut right now, he is the lone trailblazer, and theaters are going to go only so far in helping him.\n\nOutside of seeing \u201cGemini Man\u201d in standard 24 fps, many chains are giving audiences the option to see it at 60 fps in 3D, including in Imax. That\u2019s sharper than standard but in no way the amazing feat of 120 fps.\n\nThe closest way to see the movie in the US in the way Lee wants you to is offered at 14 theaters, all run by AMC, which have Dolby theaters showing it at 120 fps on a 2K projector in 3D.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you have to ask, \u2018Is a guest willing to pay more for this experience because it\u2019s so cutting edge?'\u201d one theater owner offering \u201cGemini Man\u201d at a high frame rate, who asked to speak anonymously, told Business Insider. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has risen to that level yet.\u201d\n\nRead more: \u201cGemini Man\u201d starring Will Smith is an astounding technical achievement with a truly terrible story\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the strain on the theater showing the movie. One source at a chain showing \u201cGemini Man\u201d at a high frame rate this weekend told Business Insider the projectionist has had to deal with the movie crashing while doing tests.\n\nRussell Vannorsdel, the vice president of the Iowa-based chain Fridley Theatres, said issues testing the 60 fps version that his chain will show this weekend were minimal. But he could only imagine how hard showing \u201cGemini Man\u201d the way Lee intended would be.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking full-blown 120 fps 4K 3D, that\u2019s a really big piece of content file, and playback is challenging in those circumstances as well as storage,\u201d Vannorsdel told Business Insider. \u201cBut all those things are capable of being overcome, assuming that there is an appetite for this type of format in watching movies.\u201d\n\nRemember how the popularity of James Cameron\u2019s \u201cAvatar\u201d made movies in 3D popular again? The same needs to be done with high frame rate. And Lee isn\u2019t getting it done.\n\ncaption Ang Lee, left, and Smith on the set of \u201cGemini Man.\u201d source Paramount\n\n\u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk\u201d brought in only $30.9 million worldwide ($1.7 million domestic). And despite Lee making his high-frame-rate follow-up an action movie starring Will Smith on the run from a younger version of himself, \u201cGemini Man\u201d is suffering from bad reviews (28% on Rotten Tomatoes) and not even expected to dethrone \u201cJoker\u201d from the top of the box office this weekend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always tough to have a technological advancement become a box-office draw,\u201d the Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian told Business Insider. \u201cTheater owners want movies that are going to make box office. I don\u2019t think anyone bases their moviegoing decision on any particular technology. It\u2019s the movie that gets them in. It\u2019s still, \u2018What is the movie about?'\u201d\n\nBut Lee may finally get some help in his quest. James Cameron has said as far back as 2011 that he plans to make the \u201cAvatar\u201d sequels in a high frame rate. But for now, theaters are not expecting amazingly sharp picture quality to drive in the crowds.\n\n\u201cTo me, it feels like we\u2019ve got a little bit of a longer path yet,\u201d Vannorsdel said.", "description": "Business Insider - Business Insider spoke with several movie-theater executives to understand why Ang Lee's \"Gemini Man\" is so hard to show the way he made it..
