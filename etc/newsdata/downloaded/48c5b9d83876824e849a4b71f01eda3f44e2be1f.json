The state Division of Forestry and Wildlife is working on a new agreement to allow public access to the trail while addressing concerns over safety and ranch operations.\n\nThe reservation system would set up scheduled hikes of up to 20 people conducted by trained, certified guides from the Sierra Club and the ranch, officials said.\n\nThe trail inside Haleakala National Park was the main access to the summit of Haleakala volcano before a road system was completed in 1935. A 3.3-mile (5.3-kilometer) section of the trail crosses land owned by Haleakala Ranch, which was incorporated in 1888.\n\nHaleakala Ranch laid claim to the trail for many years and said public use would create safety concerns. Others believed the trail belonged to the state and should remain open to unregulated public access. The state and the ranch drew up an agreement providing guided hikes using a reservation system.\n\nThe group Public Access Trails Hawaii and three individuals filed a class-action lawsuit challenging Haleakala Ranch\u2019s claims of ownership in January 2011. A jury sided with the plaintiffs and the state.\n\nThe Board of Land and Natural Resources has since agreed to the ranch\u2019s request to disregard the old agreement and establish a new arrangement.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Maui News, http://www.mauinews.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The state of Hawaii will consider a proposal to establish an online reservation system for guided hikes in a national park on Maui, officials said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
