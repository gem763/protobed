It\u2019s eponymous. And Barack Obama has one.\n\nThat is a potent trifecta for President Trump, and it pulled him in once again on Monday as he mused about his chances of snaring one of his white whales: the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things \u2014 if they gave it out fairly, which they don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, responding to a Pakistani journalist who told him he would deserve the award if he could work out the decades-old dispute between India and Pakistan over the territory of Kashmir.\n\nTrump offered no real evidence that the five-person Nobel committee, which is appointed by the Norwegian parliament, is actually rigged \u2014 except that it awarded Obama, then the president, the prize in 2009.\n\n\u201cThey gave one to Obama immediately after his ascent to the presidency, and he had no idea why he got it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know what, that was the only thing I agreed with him on.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s fascination with the most prestigious foreign affairs award in the world fits a well-known theme of his presidency: his dogged pursuit of praise, validation and superlatives.\n\nFile it away with Trump\u2019s insistence that he won the 2016 presidential race in a \u201clandslide\u201d (and the popular vote, too), his declaration that the crowd at his inauguration was \u201crecord-setting,\u201d and his early Cabinet meetings, where secretaries-cum-supplicants took turns lavishing adulation upon him.\n\n[Trump says he is worthy of a Nobel Prize \u2018for a lot of things\u2019 \u2014 but isn\u2019t treated fairly]\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks during a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in\u200b at the InterContinental Barclay hotel during the U.N. General Assembly session Monday in New York. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nObama won the Nobel after less than nine months as president, though even he conceded it was not a \u201crecognition of my own accomplishments,\u201d but rather a plaudit for his inspirational rhetoric. Even so, by 2018, Trump had been in office for a year and still no medal. His nomination was indeed discussed that February, but only when the Nobel committee secretary, Olav Njolstad, was delivering some disturbing news: Someone had forged an endorsement of Trump. Twice.\n\nAn Oslo police official said at the time that investigators had been in touch with the FBI, which, the New York Times reported, suggests the forgeries originated in the United States. But the committee offered few details beyond that, and the Nobel buzz subsided.\n\nThen, in the months that followed, as the frightening \u2014 and sometimes puzzling \u2014 threats Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un exchanged gave way to handshakes, promises and a remarkable planned summit, the prospect of peace loomed. And with the long line of national and foreign leaders looking to win favor with the president, the Nobel was in the air again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but if this happens President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said in spring 2018. Former president Jimmy Carter, a frequent Trump critic and one of four U.S. leaders to win the prize, said Trump should be considered if he can successfully broker peace.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in chimed in to agree.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Moon said. \u201cThe only thing we need is peace.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean leader had painstakingly flattered Trump for weeks, crediting him for creating the diplomatic environment that was making the rapprochement possible. But that comment really caught Trump\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cI just think that President Moon was very nice when he suggested it,\u201d Trump said at a White House event shortly after Moon\u2019s statement. \u201cI want to get peace. It\u2019s the main thing. \u2026 But I thought it was very generous of President Moon of South Korea to make that statement, and I appreciate it.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson, then Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, echoed Moon, saying, \u201cIf he can fix North Korea and if he can fix the Iran nuclear deal, then I don\u2019t see why he\u2019s any less of a candidate for a Nobel Peace Prize than Barack Obama, who got it before he even did anything.\u201d\n\nThe next day, a reporter asked Trump whether he thought he deserved the prize. Trump, arms crossed and smiling, said, \u201cEveryone thinks so, but I would never say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I want to do?\u201d he added. \u201cI want to get it finished. The prize I want is victory for the world.\u201d\n\nBut even though he said he was uninterested in the accolade, he continued publicly prognosticating on his chances of winning it.\n\nWhen addressing the Future Farmers of America in October 2018, Trump brought up the agronomist Norman Borlaug, whose farming innovations helped increase the world\u2019s food supply. And who, Trump pointed out, was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\u201cCan you believe it? He won the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey probably will never give it to me, even what I\u2019m doing in Korea, and in Idlib Province and all of these places. They probably will never give it to me. You know why? Because they don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nLater that year, Trump compared his own odds of winning the Nobel to when the Emmy Awards snubbed \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019ll never give it to me,\u201d Trump said in an interview with the New York Post. \u201cWe should have gotten the Emmy for \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 you know? I had the No. 1 show.\u201d\n\n[Japan\u2019s Abe won\u2019t confirm Trump Nobel Prize nomination, but media reports say he made it]\n\nJust as Trump clung to his grievances when his reality show was denied a statuette, the fact he has yet to win a Nobel Prize clearly still sticks in his craw \u2014 even as an actual peace deal between North and South Korea remains elusive.\n\nIn February, at the end of remarks announcing a national emergency at the southern border, he spent nearly three minutes making his case for the prize.\n\nHe told the audience that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had nominated him and that \u201cmany other people feel that way, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably never get it, but that\u2019s okay,\u201d he said, adding later that \u201cThis administration does a tremendous job, and we don\u2019t get credit for it.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s at least one place where he always gets the credit he feels he deserves.\n\nAt a rally the day after Graham first suggested Trump could be a laureate-in-waiting, a raucous Michigan crowd broke into a chant.\n\n\u201cNobel! Nobel!\u201d they called.\n\nTrump, a grin spreading across his face, let the chorus go on for 20 seconds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very nice, thank you,\u201d he said, as though finally \u2014 finally \u2014 accepting the award. \u201cThat\u2019s very nice. Nobel.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Fix:\n\n\u2018Inherent contempt\u2019: How House Democrats could fine or even jail Trump officials who refuse to cooperate\n\nTrump just inched toward spilling the beans on Ukraine\n\nThe Ukraine whistleblower complaint makes impeachment more likely", "description": "Trump\u2019s fascination with the most prestigious foreign affairs award in the world fits a well-known theme of his presidency: his dogged pursuit of praise, validation and superlatives.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/245sCRzQjtEVwVYYkm2YzhyEvfg=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-24-2019/t_238f53e5c8414f75bd79b883b475963d_name_Thumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
