The men's 50-kilometer race walk final was slated for a 5:30 a.m. start.\n\nMarathons were run after midnight in 38 degrees C (100 degrees F) this month at the track and field world championships in Doha, Qatar.\n\nThe IOC said it informed the track body and said it will consult with Olympic teams and broadcasters.\n\nAn Olympic panel overseeing games preparation will discuss heat measures at its Oct. 30-Nov. 1 meeting in Tokyo.\n\n\"These include better shade, water sprays, better access to water supplies and an initiative to help the athletes in their preparations,\" the IOC said.\n\nThe plan driven by increasing summer heat cuts into a key promise of Tokyo's bidding, first for the 2016 Olympics won by Rio de Janeiro and then its successful 2020 campaign, to deliver a \"compact games\" with 85% of venues in an 8-kilometer (5-mile) city center cluster.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
