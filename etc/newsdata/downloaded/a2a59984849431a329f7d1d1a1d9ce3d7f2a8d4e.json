(Tony Avelar/AP)\n\nPittsburgh Pirates pitcher Felipe V\u00e1zquez was arrested and charged with multiple felonies, including statutory sexual assault and unlawful contact with a minor, authorities announced Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said V\u00e1zquez \u2014 an all-star closer this season and in 2018 \u2014 was taken into custody in Pittsburgh on Tuesday morning after an investigation into whether he had a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old girl in Lee County, Fla. The FDLE said he was charged with computer pornography-solicitation of a child and providing obscene materials to minor.\n\nAuthorities in Pennsylvania later charged V\u00e1zquez with three felonies: statutory sexual assault of a minor 11 years or older; unlawful contact with a minor and corruption of minors, according to ESPN. V\u00e1zquez was also charged with indecent assault of a person less than 16 years old, a misdemeanor.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also reported on the charges that were later filed in Pennsylvania. According to the newspaper, details about those charges were scarce Tuesday.\n\nV\u00e1zquez was arraigned Tuesday in Pittsburgh and was not granted bail, ESPN reported. Major League Baseball placed V\u00e1zquez, 28, on administrative leave. A telephone message left for his attorney Tuesday night was not immediately returned.\n\n\u201cToday we were made aware of an active law enforcement investigation involving Felipe Vazquez and his subsequent arrest,\u201d Pirates President Frank Coonelly said in a statement. \u201cWe take this matter, and these charges in particular, extremely seriously. We have informed the Commissioner\u2019s Office of the investigation and arrest. The Commissioner\u2019s Office will immediately place Felipe Vazquez on administrative leave (and, as a result, restricted list) pursuant to the Joint MLB/MLBPA Policy. We need to be respectful to all involved and the ongoing legal proceeding. As a result, the organization, our staff and players cannot comment any further at this time.\u201d\n\nHere's Chris Archer's reaction to the Felipe Vazquez stuff: pic.twitter.com/L4HYaoUZTi \u2014 Jason Mackey (@JMackeyPG) September 17, 2019\n\nI asked Archer to describe the mood of the Pirates clubhouse right now: pic.twitter.com/pexXnCDUfZ \u2014 Jason Mackey (@JMackeyPG) September 17, 2019\n\nThe FDLE began investigating in August after it received information that V\u00e1zquez continued to have a relationship via text message with the girl, who is now 15 years old, the department said. The FDLE said the girl received a video from V\u00e1zquez in July \u201cin which he is shown performing a sex act. Additionally, V\u00e1zquez allegedly sent the victim text messages suggesting they would meet for sex after his baseball season was over.\u201d\n\nAccording to ESPN, a police affidavit revealed the texts, photographs and video were discovered by the girl\u2019s mother. On July 23, the mother sent an image of the messages to V\u00e1zquez and notified him that her daughter was a minor.\n\nPolice seized \u201cseveral electronic devices\u201d after executing a search warrant at V\u00e1zquez\u2019s apartment in Pittsburgh. He is being held at the Allegheny County Jail until he can be extradited to Lee County, on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Venezuelan-born V\u00e1zquez, then known as Felipe Rivero, made his MLB debut for the Washington Nationals in 2015 before he was traded to the Pirates in July 2016. He has 86 saves over the past three seasons and is 5-1 with a 1.65 ERA and 28 saves this season.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nNationals Manager Dave Martinez undergoes heart procedure, remains in Washington for testing\n\nHow the NL Central race could benefit the Nationals\u2019 postseason push\n\nThe Nationals are learning how fast things can change in a wild-card race\n\nAn MLB player suffered facial fractures after being hit.
