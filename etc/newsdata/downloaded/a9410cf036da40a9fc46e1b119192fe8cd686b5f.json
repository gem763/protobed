There are also now an array of writers from China, many of them living in the West, who have created a specifically Chinese voice that is accessible to foreigners in English (as well as a litany of other languages), with much of their best work, be it novels, memoirs, or journalism, banned in their motherland. In a way, these writers have picked up where Wild Swans left off, providing an ongoing dissenting portrait of China in the years since the events that Chang wrote about. In addition, a younger cadre of Western historians who study China deeply has emerged, demolishing whatever remains of Maoist apologetics.\n\nYet one thing is unchanged from Chang\u2019s younger years: Writing about China remains a dangerous occupation\u2014dangerous of course to China\u2019s citizens, but now even to foreigners who challenge the official doctrine. Witness the storm of protest from China, the threats and the economic penalties imposed on the National Basketball Association over a single tweet by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, who briefly wrote of (and hastily deleted) his support for pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. China\u2019s ruling authority has a very thin skin. Inside the country, the danger of writing leads to pervasive self-censorship, and more and more that appears to apply to those outside the country, too.\n\nRead: Hollywood\u2019s great leap backward on free expression\n\nOf course, even at the time when Wild Swans appeared, Chang was not alone in opening Western eyes to the full horror of the Maoist era. When we spoke, she was quick to give credit to Nien Cheng\u2019s Life and Death in Shanghai, an unforgettable account of survival in the Cultural Revolution, as an earlier example of such works. Subsequently there have been other books\u2014Wu Ningkun\u2019s A Single Tear and the physicist Fang Lizhi\u2019s The Most Wanted Man in China among the most affecting of them. But while she hasn\u2019t had the field to herself for a long time, Chang occupies a special position, not only because Wild Swans, with its historical, multigenerational sweep and its sheer narrative power, is a true masterpiece, but also because she has moved on from memoirist to what might be called a polemical historian.\n\nChang could have followed what some might have expected to be her natural trajectory\u2014becoming a kind of Chinese Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a public critic of China\u2019s cruelly authoritarian, one-party system. Her more recent works, including Big Sister, Little Sister, Red Sister, out October 29, instead take a different approach.\n\n\u201cI like the distance that only history provides,\u201d she said. \u201cHistory is no less devastating.\u201d She meant devastating in the effect that an honest attempt at recounting the past can have on the sanctioned Chinese version of the past. In China, that is the heroic chronicle according to which the Communist Party rescued the country from the scourges of imperialism, poverty, and oppression. A few years ago, in a proclamation known as \u201cDocument Number Nine,\u201d the party\u2019s central committee warned against what it said were wrong ideological tendencies, among them \u201chistorical nihilism,\u201d meaning history that undermines the official account of the past. \u201cHistory is one of the biggest taboos in China today,\u201d Chang told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not some harmless, apolitical thing.\u201d In this sense, Chang is one of the world\u2019s leading historical nihilists.", "description": "Jung Chang is one of the most celebrated chroniclers of modern China.
