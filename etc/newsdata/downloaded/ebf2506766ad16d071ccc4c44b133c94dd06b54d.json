But the formula unveiled by the agency Tuesday would require those refineries to add ethanol based on projections rather than the actual number of gallons exempted.\n\nThis is angering ethanol groups that had praised the policy just a little over a week ago.\n\n\u201cIf the Oct. 4 announcement from EPA was a big step forward, today\u2019s supplemental proposal is a step backward,\u201d Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper said in a release, asking for an intervention from Trump himself. \u201cThis proposal is not what was promised by the administration.\u201d\n\nEthanol producers worry there will be a major disconnect between the actual number of gallons of ethanol that are not blended into the fuel supply after the EPA doles out waivers and the number of gallons the government projects will be exempted.\n\n\u201cWe are outraged the Environmental Protection Agency did not implement the details that were presented and outlined by the president only eleven days ago,\u201d the Iowa Corn Growers Association said in a statement. \u201cAny proposal that does not account for actual waived gallons under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) fails to restore the integrity of the law.\u201d\n\nThe EPA in August announced it was giving out 31 such waivers to small refineries, bringing the total to 85 under the Trump administration, a sharp uptick from the fewer than 10 that were issued under former President Obama.\n\nThat proved a catalyzing event for farmers, particularly in Iowa, who have been putting political pressure on Trump for find a fix.\n\nTrump has since been struggling to please both corn farmers and the oil and gas industry with his attempts to reform the RFS program, alternatively angering one side or the other with each hint at a new proposal.\n\nOn Tuesday, both groups were united in their displeasure. The oil and gas industry opposes changes to the waiver process mainly because it doesn't think larger refineries should have to take on the gallons small refineries pass up.\n\n\u201cWhile the granting of widespread small refinery exemptions should not be occurring in the first place, there is simply no logic in forcing complying refineries to bear the burden of decisions outside of their control. We are evaluating our options and fully intend to vigorously challenge this misguided policy,\u201d Frank Macchiarola, vice president of downstream and industry operations at the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nThe proposal still faces a 30-day comment period, and the EPA expects to finalize a new policy by the end of the year.\n\nThough it is not popular with industry groups, Republican politicians praised the proposal.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has made clear that he is an ally of corn and soybean farmers as well as ethanol and biodiesel producers. He is fighting for the farmer. This announcement is great news for Iowa, the Midwest and the entire country,\u201d Sen.

I really don\u2019t,\u201d Jeff Samuelson, whose family farm is near Tipton, Iowa, said of Trump. \u201cThis gets pretty personal when this affects our bottom line.\u201d", "description": "New details released Thursday as part of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to boost ethanol are getting low marks from key corners of President Trump\u2019s base:\u00a0corn farmers\u00a0and the oil and gas industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/farm_iowa_corn_072018getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
