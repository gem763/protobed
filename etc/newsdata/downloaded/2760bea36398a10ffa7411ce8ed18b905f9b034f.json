Just not musically.\n\nSince the release of his debut album over two years ago, Lil Uzi Vert has trickled out a couple follow-up singles and lent a verse to the odd song by other rappers. In those two years, he\u2019s focused much of his creative energy on Instagram, where the 25-year-old rapper has posted over 70 \u201c\u2018fit pics.\u201d These outfit posts\u2014which often consist of multiple images so his 10 million-plus followers can really soak up the details\u2014capture the 5-foot-4 rapper in designer looks. One week, he\u2019s boarding a jet in a Saint Laurent American flag sweater; the next he\u2019s posing poolside in head-to-toe Louis Vuitton; in yet another he\u2019s wearing a shiny red bucket hat and more chains than Mr. T in his chain-zealot heyday. These posts are challenging and shaping fan perceptions of Lil Uzi Vert. He is not just a rapper; he is a fashion influencer. (Through their representatives, all the musicians mentioned in this story passed on the opportunity to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nOther stars who\u2019ve conquered Billboard have been actively rebranding themselves as social-media-savvy fashion plates. In March, Justin Bieber announced that he was stepping back from music to focus on family and his health, but has also found time to catalog his many outfits on Instagram. \u201cMy style is impeccable,\u201d he captioned a post showing his heavily-tattooed frame in an unbuttoned shirt, his khakis pushed low enough to reveal his underwear\u2019s \u201cCalvin Klein\u201d waistband. For other additions to his feed, Mr. Beiber just photographs his clothes laid out on the floor like a \u2019tween organizing his outfit before the first day of school.\n\nYou\u2019ll find more polish and no shortage of magazine-quality fashion photoshoots in the Instagram feed of Beyonc\u00e9, whose last solo album came out in 2016 (she did produce July\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d soundtrack). Among the top tier of pop artists, however, Rihanna may be the most prolific poster of late: Over one 8-hour period last week, the Barbadian star dropped five outfit posts on her Instagram. Having launched her Fenty fashion label with LVMH this year, the singer is clearly focusing on style, laughing off questions about her next album\u2019s drop-date at media appearances.\n\nStars use \u201cInstagram to stay relevant, to give their fans updates, to show that they\u2019re still there,\u201d said Allen Onyia, one half of the fraternal duo behind Upscale Hype, an Instagram account that tracks celebrity outfits. It\u2019s no longer enough for a musician to release an album every four years\u2014fans overstimulated by the current mediascape will forget about them and move onto whoever is scaling the Spotify charts that week. Outfit posts can sate an impatient, distracted fan base. At least up to a point: For every Instagram comment praising Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s \u201cdrip\u201d\u2014which is to say, his swagger\u2014another begs him to release his second album.\n\nRappers have long flaunted their fashion bona fides via their lyrics, sprinkling references to Gucci, Dior and Prada throughout songs. But Instagram offers rappers a richer, more visual medium in which to flex and flash. They can draft a member of their entourage to snap a pic, then post it on Instagram and reap thousands of likes. Listeners needn\u2019t imagine what a star\u2019s Louis Vuitton footwear looks like; they can ogle the shoes right on their phones. Using Instagram as a platform to peacock rare clothes speaks to rap\u2019s \u201ccompetitive\u201d nature, said Jian Deleon, editorial director at HighSnobiety, a website that covers the intersection of street and high fashion. \u201cI have it, and you don\u2019t\u201d is the message many such posts send, particularly for Lil Uzi Vert who regularly mugs in hard-to-find, decades-old, archival items from niche designers like Yohji Yamamoto and Vivienne Westwood.\n\nThese artists are asking fans to respect them for something beyond music. As Lil Uzi Vert told GQ magazine in an interview in its latest issue, referring to his outfit posts, \u201cHonestly, in my heart, I think I do this better than music.\u201d To an outsider, Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s outfits, or Mr. Bieber\u2019s or Rihanna\u2019s, may appear extreme, but for the most part fans seem to react positively to these posts. \u201cI want this fit so bad,\u201d \u201cLove this fit,\u201d \u201cFit is [insert fire emoji]\u201d read some of the comments on a recent Justin Bieber outfit post. According to the social-media tracker SocialBlade.com, Beyonce\u2019s account is the 4th most-followed on Instagram, Mr. Bieber\u2019s ranks 8th and Rihanna\u2019s comes in at 22nd. The clothing and the brands that stars wear have inspired \u201cfandoms unto themselves,\u201d said Mr. Deleon.\n\nThough Lil Uzi Vert remains a notable exception, many of these musicians are now parlaying their Instagram success into budding fashion businesses. In his shots, Mr. Bieber often showcases clothes from Drewhouse, his fashion label. Beyonc\u00e9 sprawls out on an expanse of Adidas shoes in a recent post to languidly announce her partnership with the sneaker company. Lately, most of Rihanna\u2019s uploads depict her modelling items from her line Fenty.\n\nStars today often use Instagram to tease or market other products outside of their music, said Upscale Hype\u2019s Mr. Onyia\u2014creating more ways for fans to connect to the artists between albums. But if you can\u2019t countenance Fenty\u2019s $400 hoodie, you can always throw Rihanna a like on Instagram to express your still-feverish support.\n\nWrite to Jacob Gallagher at Jacob.Gallagher@wsj.com", "description": "Artists like Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna and Justin Bieber are behaving more like Instagram fashion influencers than traditional musicians.", "authors": ["Jacob Gallagher", "Jacob.Gallagher Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108720/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
