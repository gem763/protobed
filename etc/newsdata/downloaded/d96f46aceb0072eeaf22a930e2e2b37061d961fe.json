Is that true?\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don\u2019t know, but Erdo\u011fan\u2019s not your friend. Pat, you\u2019ve done a great job. To your viewers, if you are not praying for the Kurds, we should all be ashamed of ourselves. It was the Kurds who worked for the American military to destroy ISIS. If we abandon the Kurds, it will be dishonorable, it will be a disaster. Erdo\u011fan invaded Turkey \u2014 excuse me \u2014 Syria and he has created a vacuum for ISIS to come back. The Kurds cannot fight Turkey and control the 10,000 ISIS prisoners.\n\nI am looking to President Trump to change this. I will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump\u2019s worst nightmare. I will not sit along the sidelines and watch a good ally, the Kurds, be slaughtered by Turkey and watch Iran move into Syria and become another nightmare for Israel. This is a defining moment for President Trump. He needs to up his game\n\n\u2026\n\nROBERTSON: We\u2019ve got 50 tactical nuclear weapons in Turkey. Erdo\u011fan is really in control of that now, isn\u2019t he? How do we get that huge airbase or are we just going to adbandon that or is he going to take it away from us?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Over my dead body. I miss Ronald Reagan. Pat, you\u2019re old enough to know what American strength looks like. Do you think Erdo\u011fan would have done this if Reagan had been around? Do you think Assad would have done what he had done if Reagan had been around? So this is Trump\u2019s chance to be like Ronald Reagan. We\u2019ve got a par of aces and they\u2019ve got a pair of twos\u2026 President Trump, if you are listening to this interview, if you remove all of our forces from Syria, you are throwing the Kurds over, ISIS will come back on your watch, Iran will take, and you, my friend, will be in great jeopardy of losing an election we can\u2019t afford you to lose. So don\u2019t be like Obama, be like Reagan and stand up to Erdo\u011fan.", "description": "Lindsey Graham threatened to become Trump's \"worst nightmare\" unless he protects the Kurds amid Turkey's military\u00a0excursion into Syria.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/wi/afp/20/783af4_senator-lindsey-graham-has-warned-an-overwhelming-military-response-any-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
