'Their populations are declining in the wild as they face threats of deforestation, habitat loss, and capture for the pet trade.\u2019 The average lifespan of this species are 15 to 25 years in the wild.\n\n\u2018Based on DCPD\u2019s investigation as of today, we do not believe the little monkey, Pickett, found his way outside the enclosure on his own,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Nor do we believe he traveled to where he was found on his own. His father\u2019s injury appears to be from blunt force trauma in excess of what would occur from a fall.\u2019\n\nOfficers believed that Vern was trying to protect Pickett when he sustained the injuries.\n\nZoo officials tell DailyMail.com that the facility did not have cameras at the time and there is no surveillance of the alleged break in.\n\nThey have since installed cameras.\n\nHannah Schroeder, Head Zookeeper, said: \u2018Vern is very protective of the younger monkey and would not have let him go without a fight.\u2019\n\nAfter considering the best course of action, Vern was transported to Kansas State University for surgery on September 10.\n\nAuthorities believe 32-year-old Vern (pictured) was injured while trying to protect his son, Pickett, from an intruder in their enclosure\n\nAt the time, the surgery was deemed successful and Vern was in the midst of recovering.\n\nPickett was given a clean bill of health and is currently at the monkey enclosure.\n\nFrancis said: \u2018Though I doubt the culprit has the decency to come forward. I also suspect someone may know who committed this act or have and idea who would do this. If that\u2019s you, we would greatly appreciate talking with you.\u2019\n\nPictured: Vern's son Pickett after Kansas authorities rescued him near the Dodge City city limits on September 3\n\nThe Wright Park Zoo (pictured) has installed surveillance cameras since the initial alleged break-in\n\nIn the wake of Vern's passing, Facebook users expressed their condolences.\n\nOne woman said: \u2018OH MY GOD NOOOO, this can\u2019t be, I thought he was doing good, was so excited to see him again. RIP sweet loving Vern, [you] made so many hearts smile, u will be dearly missed.\u2019\n\nVern has been at Wright Park Zoo 1988 and, along with a female monkey named Charro, was one-years-old when he arrived.\n\nThe two have at least four offspring, including their youngest sons, Jack and Pickett.", "description": "Vern, a Capuchin Monkey in Dodge City, Kansas, died on Tuesday after suffering a broken knee cap when someone allegedly broke into the monkey enclosure at Wright Park Zoo", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/18/20390244-0-image-a-28_1572459468009.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
