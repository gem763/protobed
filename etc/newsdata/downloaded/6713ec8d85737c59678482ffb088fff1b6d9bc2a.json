He said he would start a probe only after U.S. officials launched an investigation.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s put this through prosecutors, not through presidents,\u2019\u201d Lutsenko told The Times. \u201cI told him I could not start an investigation just for the interests of an American official.\u201d\n\nTrump pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and son Hunter, who served on the board of an energy company in Ukraine. That July 25 phone call was the focus of a whistleblower complaint that triggered the House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma at the same time as his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump also has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.\n\nIn the July call, Zelensky appeared to make an effort to stay in Trump\u2019s good graces, telling him at least twice that he was \u201cabsolutely right.\u201d But, after the White House released a rough transcript this week based on officials\u2019 recollections of the call, Zelensky told reporters he didn\u2019t feel pushed, emphasizing that \u201cno one can pressure me.\u201d He also sought to play down the situation involving Biden and his son\u2019s activities in Ukraine, calling it just one of \u201cmany cases that I talk about with leaders of other countries.\u201d\n\nZelensky was elected in a landslide this past April on promises to uproot the country\u2019s endemic corruption and end fighting with Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east.\n\nFORMER UKRAINE PRIME MINISTER SAYS COUNTRY MUST INVESTIGATE HUNTER BIDEN\n\nLutsenko added about Giuliani: \u201cI had to tell him how law enforcement functions here.\u201d He said that he could not reopen the case just because Trump wanted it.\n\nGiuliani defended his investigation of Democrats Sunday.\n\n\"My role is very, very simple. I'm a lawyer defending a client,\" Giuliani told host Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" stating that he was exploring a lead on information that he claimed not only could vindicate Trump regarding claims that he colluded with Russia in the 2016 election, but that could show that it was Democrats who colluded with Ukraine to hurt Trump's campaign.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGiuliani stated that so far House Democrats have not subpoenaed him to testify about his work with Ukraine, but if they did he would have to run it by Trump first.\n\n\"I'm his attorney, there's something called attorney-client privilege,\" he said. \"That has to be considered even if they don't think he should have attorney-client privilege.\"\n\nFox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "Ukraine\u2019s former top law enforcement official told the Los Angeles Times he saw no reason to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
