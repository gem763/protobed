His return to that role did not go well. Not well at all.\n\nThe left-handed starter was pressed into bullpen duty as part of Washington Nationals manager Dave Martinez\u2019s plan to overcome a shaky group of relievers. Corbin wound up being charged with six runs while getting just two outs in the sixth inning of a 10-4 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in their NL Division Series on Sunday night.\n\nThe setback put Washington behind 2-1 in the best-of-five series, with Game 4 on Monday. Corbin has taken the loss in both of LA\u2019s wins, including as the starter in Game 1.\n\n\u201cJust stinks,\u201d Corbin said in a monotone voice. \u201cFeel like I let these guys down.\u201d\n\nHe was out in the home \u2018pen at Nationals Park from the start of the evening, occasionally pacing around the unfamiliar surroundings. When he was called upon to protect a 2-1 lead at the start of the sixth, things went OK at first.\n\nSure, Corbin allowed a leadoff single to Cody Bellinger, who had been 0 for 8 in the series. But the lefty struck out the next two hitters.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when everything unraveled for Corbin, who went 14-7 with a 3.25 ERA in the first season of his $140 million, six-year deal with the Nationals.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just coming at you,\u201d said David Freese, who singled as a pinch hitter in the sixth. \u201cI don\u2019t mind lefties, but he\u2019s tough. You have to check yourself when you face him, for sure.\u201d\n\nFive hitters in a row all reached against Corbin, including a pair on two-run doubles by Russell Martin and pinch-hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nThose came on what Corbin called \u201ctwo terrible pitches.\u201d\n\nEach of the run-scoring hits by the Dodgers in that inning came with two outs and two strikes.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in major league history that a team put up a total of seven two-out, two strike runs - reliever Wander Suero was charged with the seventh - in one inning.\n\n\u201cWe tried to waste a couple pitches,\u201d Nationals catcher Yan Gomes said, \u201cand they would either foul it off or not bite at all.\u201d\n\nNow Washington has to hope that Max Scherzer can come through in Game 4, when the three-time Cy Young Award winner faces Dodgers left-hander Rich Hill.\n\nWith an NL-worst bullpen ERA, Martinez has been trying to cover up that deficiency by using his starters in relief.\n\nStephen Strasburg followed Scherzer in the NL wild-card victory over visiting Milwaukee on Tuesday; Scherzer followed Strasburg in the Game 2 NLDS victory at LA on Friday.\n\nThe tactic flopped Sunday.\n\n\u201cI trust Pat. He\u2019s been unbelievable all year. And I would do it again. I really would,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe was the guy. I just feel bad for him, because he went out there, gave us everything he had. He did. And once again, he looked at me in the eye after he came out and says, \u2018I\u2019ll be ready tomorrow.\u2019 So that\u2019s the kind of guys we got on this team.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP freelance writer Harvey Valentine contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Patrick Corbin hadn't pitched in relief in a major league game since one such outing in 2017.
