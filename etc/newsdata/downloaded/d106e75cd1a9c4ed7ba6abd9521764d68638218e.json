He may have targeted almost 200 children and boasted that those from poor communities made easier victims than well-to-do westerners.\n\nHe received 22 life sentences for his crimes and told he must serve at least 25 years behind bars.\n\nHuckle is one of the most prolific child sex abusers known to have operated in Malaysia, where the authorities have been criticized for failing to tackle sex crimes against children properly.\n\nHe also produced his own online pedophile manual advising others on how to abuse children and escape detection, described by trial judge Peter Rook as a \"truly evil document\".\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Alex Richardson)", "description": "One of Britain's most prolific child sex offenders, Richard Huckle, has died three years into a life sentence for abusing Malaysian and Cambodian children, Britain's Ministry of Justice said on Monday, with media saying he had been stabbed to death.
