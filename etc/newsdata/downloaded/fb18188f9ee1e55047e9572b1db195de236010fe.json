'Plus that cockiness and confidence about him. He sees himself as the biggest challenger to David De Gea at Manchester United and I love that. Even though he is not at the club right now.\n\nDEAN HENDERSON'S SEASON IN NUMBERS Premier League Appearances: 8 Clean sheets: 3 Goals conceded: 7 Saves: 23 (76.67% save rate , eighth most in PL)\n\n'I have no problems with that. He is doing the right thing and getting experience at a good club. He is still a young keeper. Peter Schmeichel didn't come to Old Trafford until he was 28. David De Gea was the exception at 19 or 20. I have said this to Dean privately. He is still a young keeper.'\n\nHenderson's form for Chris Wilder's side saw him called up for international duty, earning a spot in Gareth Southgate's England squad for the ongoing Euro 2020 qualifiers, following the withdrawal of Tom Heaton due to injury.\n\nThe Whitehaven-born star was also loaned to Sheffield United last season from Old Trafford, keeping 21 clean sheets in 46 games.\n\nSteele said Henderson knows his parent club are keeping an eye on him.\n\n'Knowing Dean as I do, what he will be thinking is, 'Richard Hartis (Manchester United's senior goalkeeping coach) and Ole Gunnar (Solskjaer), please keep sending your scouts to Sheffield United.\n\nUnited's current number one David de Gea has performed under-par so far this season\n\nGareth Southgate at the Premier League match between Sheffield United and Liverpool\n\n'He knows he is being watched,' the 65-year-old said.\n\nUnited's current number one David de Gea has performed under-par in his side's torrid start to the Premier League season, keeping just two clean sheets in eight games.\n\nHowever, the Spaniard signed a new four-year deal last month and United also have strong understudies in Argentina keeper Sergio Romero and seasoned veteran Lee Grant, but Steele insists Henderson 'knows what is required'.\n\n'But Richard Hartis will be asking, 'Who is going to challenge De Gea?' I am sure Dean will be thinking he can be the number one at Manchester United,' he added.\n\nHenderson previously earned plaudits on loan at Stockport, Grimsby and Shrewsbury and this season has a save rate of 76.67%, higher than De Gea.\n\nEric Steele (centre) speaks with goalkeeper David De Gea (right) during his time at United", "description": "The 22-year-old was pivotal in helping the Blades gain promotion from the Championship last season and has kept three clean sheets this year - earning himself an England call up.", "authors": ["Leigh Mcmanus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/12/19689400-0-image-a-39_1571051619422.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
