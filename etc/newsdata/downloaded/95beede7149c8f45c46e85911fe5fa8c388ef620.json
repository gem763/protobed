On all occasions, thousands marched on despite the bans.\n\nThe front had applied for approval to march from Salisbury Garden, Tsim Sha Tsui to the high-speed rail terminal in West Kowloon at 1.30pm on Sunday.\n\nApart from echoing the main demands of the protest movement, which has been running for months, the front also called on the government to abolish the anti-mask law it brought it earlier this month.\n\n\n\nThe law, enacted without Legislative Council scrutiny under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, stipulates a penalty of jail for up to one year and a fine up to HK$25,000 (US$3,200) for wearing any face covering at a public gathering.\n\nChief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said the ban was to deter radical protesters from breaking the law, following increased levels of violence against the police and damage to shops and the city\u2019s railway system.\n\nThe front\u2019s vice-convenor Eric Lai Yan-ho said it would likely appeal the objection.\n\n\u201cWe are still studying the letter of objection,\u201d Lai said.\n\nCarrie Lam defends police during Facebook live session\n\nThe ban came days after the front\u2019s convenor, Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, was assaulted in Mong Kok by a group armed with hammers on Wednesday night.\n\nWriting on his social media account on Wednesday, Sham called on the public to not harbour hatred against ethnic minorities, after reports that the attackers were not ethnically Chinese.\n\n\u201cThe problem is always with the system, with the authorities,\u201d Sham wrote.\n\nAs of Friday, Sham was still in Kwong Wah Hospital.", "description": "In the letter of objection, issued days after convenor Jimmy Sham was beaten and hospitalised, the force notes the need to maintain public safety", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/8344ff1c-f15d-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires125524.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
