She was in fact a serial monogamist.'\n\nAddressing the disparity between the way male historical figures are treated, she said: 'You look at the way Louis XIV or Henry VIII behaved \u2014 their behaviour was completely acceptable, whereas Catherine had a series of four or five relationships, which in any modern woman's life is not that many.'\n\nThe Queen actress added that Catherine - who reigned from 1762-1796- was never the 'mad, sexual' person she is portrayed as, having been a 'serial monogamist', and said she was proud to play the 'liberated, open' leader.\n\nThe show will chart the latter years of Catherine's 34-year reign and was filmed in Russia, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nHistoric: Weighing in on the historic sexism, she told The Sun : It's appalling, the way history treats successful, powerful women.

In the last 10 years - or really the last three or four years - things have changed substantially.'\n\n'When I first did Prime Suspect they were not at all sure that a female-led drama would be acceptable to the public. So that's how much things have changed since we first began Prime Suspect. It's changed hugely.'\n\nDame Helen was confirmed in January to be playing the role of the Russian Queen who had an extremely colourful love life.\n\nFollowing the assassination of her husband Emperor Peter III in 1762, Catherine was rumoured to have had a string of male lovers and children through illicit affairs.\n\nRed carpet: According to Sky, this four-part drama 'delves into the politically tumultuous and sexually charged court of the most powerful female monarch in history'\n\nIt will be Helen's first major television role for 13 years, having last played Queen Elizabeth I in a Channel 4 miniseries.\n\nHelen has Russian ancestry and was born Ilyena Mironov, as her grandfather was an aristocrat and diplomat who, with his family, was stranded in Britain by the Russian revolution in 1917.\n\nHis son married a British woman and anglicised the family name to Mirren when the actress was ten.", "description": "The actress, 74, enjoys a night of passion in episode three of the series with a mystery male lover.
