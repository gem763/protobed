It is unfortunate that did not happen.\n\n'He was in a total mess. He was bleeding profusely and had his pair of trousers torn from the back.'\n\nLocal county assembly representative James Karanja, who raced Mr Wanyoike to Level Five Hospital, Murang (pictured), said he was told a man in his ward had been 'Bobbitted'\n\nMr Wanyoike spent six hours drinking with friends before heading back to one of their homes at around 2am.\n\nDuring the journey home one friend repeatedly mentioned wanting to circumcise Mr Wanyoike but he dismissed it as a bad joke.\n\nBut just hours later neighbours were woken up to the sounds of his screams - although he says he didn't realise the damage that had been done.\n\n'Throughout the journey home he kept telling me that he would circumcise me. I treated it as a bad joke. I thought he was drunk,' Mr Wanyoike told K24 Digital.\n\nLocal county assembly representative James Karanja, who raced Mr Wanyoike to Level Five Hospital, Murang, said he was told a man in his ward had been 'Bobbitted'.\n\nMr Karanja, who referred to the phrase coined in 1993 after American Lorena Bobbitt cut off hubby John Wayne's willy, suggested drugs might be to blame for the attack on Moses.\n\nMr Wanyoike spent six hours drinking with friends before heading back to one of their homes at around 2am.

We went to the police and reported the matter,' he said.\n\n'Such a bizarre act can't be done by sober minded people. They must have been taking drugs and this is becoming a problem in our society.\n\n'The relevant agencies should step up the war against drugs to avert such incidences.'\n\nSuspect Gerald Mbugua has been arrested by police.\n\nSenior officer Dorothy Gaitenga said they were still trying to unravel the truth behind the gory episode.\n\n'One suspect in our custody and is helping us join the dots and establish what led to the incident,' she told the Daily Nation.\n\n'Investigations are underway and we shall prefer charges against him once we are through.'", "description": "Moses Wanyoike, 51, only realised his genitals were missing when he went to the toilet and looked down after spending the night at a friend's house in Muranga, Kenya.", "authors": ["Emer Scully For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/18/19338628-0-image-a-2_1570296781047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
