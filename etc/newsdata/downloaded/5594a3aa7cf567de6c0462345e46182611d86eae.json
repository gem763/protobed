The performance score is made up of the lift and drop test (60 per cent), stability test (20 per cent), rain test (10 per cent) and puncture test (10 per cent). * For the puncture test, a heavy pointed cylinder was dropped on to the suitcase surface to see whether any damage occurred. * For the rain test, Choice placed the suitcase upright under a custom-made shower rig for 10 minutes to simulate a downpour and check how wet the newspaper was inside. * For the stability test, their testers packed the cases with 4kg of clothing and placed them on a tilting platform. The suitcases were tilted until they tip. They then recorded the angle the cases were at when they tipped over. * Lastly, ease of use was assessed by three triallists scoring each suitcase on aspects like balance and manouverability. They also wheeled the cases with a 5kg load over a range of surfaces including grass, carpet, stairs, asphalt and footpaths.\n\nPreviously, consumer organisation Choice compared carry-on baggage from the likes of IKEA, Kmart, Samsonite, Antler, Delsey and Flylite.\n\nThey compared each suitcase for water resistance, durability, stability, performance, puncture and ease of use.\n\nComing out on top, with 87 per cent in Choice's ratings, was the American Tourister Curio suitcase, which retails for $239.\n\nThis was followed by several products, all of which scored 86 per cent.\n\nIn second place, the consumer organisation cited Flylite's Pro Lite 54-centimetre suitcase, which costs $200.\n\nSamsonite's 72-hour DLX option - reduced from $329 to $195 - also scored 86 per cent and an impressive 91 per cent performance score.\n\nThe popularity of this option is in no small part down to its ease of use.\n\nWeighing in at less than two kilograms, it's perfect for those who struggle to pack light.\n\nInterestingly, Kmart's soft lightweight case - which retails for just $49 - also scored 86 per cent.\n\nFor less than $50, this is one of the cheapest options on the market.", "description": "Frequent flyers are going wild for a $34.99 cabin bag from IKEA, dubbing it perfect for your next short trip.
