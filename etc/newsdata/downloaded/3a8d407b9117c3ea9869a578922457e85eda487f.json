Listen up.\u2019 How white supremacists are recruiting boys online.", "language": "en", "text": "At first, it wasn\u2019t obvious that anything was amiss. Kids are naturally curious about the complicated world around them, so Joanna Schroeder wasn\u2019t surprised when her 11- and 14-year-old boys recently started asking questions about timely topics such as cultural appropriation and transgender rights.\n\nBut she sensed something off about the way they framed their questions, she says \u2014 tinged with a bias that didn\u2019t reflect their family\u2019s progressive values. She heard one of her sons use the word \u201ctriggered\u201d in a sarcastic, mocking tone. And there was the time Schroeder watched as her son scrolled through the \u201cExplore\u201d screen on his Instagram account and she caught a glimpse of a meme depicting Adolf Hitler.\n\nSchroeder, a writer and editor in Southern California, started paying closer attention, talking to her boys about what they\u2019d encountered online. Then, after her kids were in bed one night last month, she opened Twitter and began to type.\n\n\u201cDo you have white teenage sons?\u201d she wrote. \u201cListen up.\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets, Schroeder described the onslaught of racist, sexist and homophobic memes that had inundated her kids\u2019 social media accounts unbidden, and the way those memes \u2014 packaged as irreverent, \u201cedgy\u201d humor \u2014 can indoctrinate children into the world of alt-right extremism and white supremacy.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know whether anyone would pay attention to her warning. But by the time she awoke the next morning, her thread had gone viral; as of Sept. 16, it had been retweeted more than 81,000 times and liked more than 180,000 times. Over the following days, Schroeder\u2019s inbox filled with messages from other parents who were deeply concerned about what their own kids were seeing and sharing online.\n\n\u201cIt just exploded, it hit a nerve,\u201d she says of her message. \u201cI realized, okay, there are other people who are also seeing this.\u201d\n\nOver recent years, white-supremacist and alt-right groups have steadily emerged from the shadows \u2014 marching with torches through the streets Charlottesville, clashing with counterprotesters in Portland, Ore., papering school campuses with racist fliers. In June, the Anti-Defamation League reported that white-supremacist recruitment efforts on college campuses had increased for the third straight year, with more than 313 cases of white-supremacist propaganda recorded between September 2018 and May 2019. This marked a 7 percent increase over the previous academic year, which saw 292 incidents of extremist propaganda, according to the ADL.\n\nAs extremist groups have grown increasingly visible in the physical world, their influence over malleable young minds in the digital realm has become a particularly urgent concern for parents. A barrage of recent reports has revealed how online platforms popular with kids (YouTube, iFunny, Instagram, Reddit and multiplayer video games, among others) are used as tools for extremists looking to recruit. Earlier this year, a viral essay in Washingtonian magazine \u2014 written by an anonymous mother who chronicled a harrowing, year-long struggle to reclaim her teenage son from the grips of alt-right extremists who had befriended him online \u2014 sparked a flurry of passionate discussions and debates among parents across social media.\n\nParents wanted to know: What was happening to their kids? Why was it happening, and how could it be stopped?\n\n[They were raised to be \u2018colorblind\u2019 \u2014 but now more white parents are learning to talk about race]\n\nFor extremist groups, the goal is hardly a secret; the founder and editor of the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer has openly declared that the site targets children as young as 11.\n\n\u201cThis is a specific strategy of white nationalists and alt-right groups,\u201d says Lindsay Schubiner, program director at the Western States Center, a nonprofit focused on social, economic, racial and environmental justice. Schubiner co-authored a tool kit published by the center this year that offers guidance to school officials and parents who are facing white-nationalist threats in their communities.\n\n\u201cWhite-nationalist and alt-right groups use jokes and memes as a way to normalize bigotry while still maintaining plausible deniability,\u201d Schubiner says, \u201cand it works very well as a recruitment strategy for young people.\u201d\n\nSchroeder saw this firsthand when she sat down with her kids to look at their Instagram accounts together.\n\n\u201cI saw the memes that came across my kids\u2019 timelines, and once I started clicking on those and seeking this material out, then it became clear what was really happening,\u201d she says. With each tap of a finger, the memes grew darker: Sexist and racist jokes (for instance, a looping video clip of a white boy demonstrating how to \u201cget away with saying the n-word,\u201d or memes referring to teen girls as \u201cthots,\u201d an acronym for \u201cthat ho over there\u201d) led to more racist and dehumanizing propaganda, such as infographics falsely asserting that black people are inherently violent.\n\n\u201cThe more I clicked, the more I started to see memes about white supremacy,\u201d Schroeder says, \u201cand that\u2019s what was really scary.\u201d\n\nThat pattern of escalation is familiar to Christian Picciolini, an author and former neo-Nazi who left the movement in 1996 and now runs the Free Radicals Project, which supports others who want to leave extremist movements.\n\n\u201cYouth have always been critical to the growth of extremist movements, since the beginning of time. Young people are idealistic, they\u2019re driven, they are motivated, and they\u2019re not afraid to be vocal. So if you can fool them into a certain narrative that seems to speak to them, then that\u2019s the growth of your movement,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never seen an extremist movement grow as fast as I have in the last 10 years.\u201d\n\nMost of the people who contact Picciolini looking for help \u2014 anywhere from 10 to 30 per week, he says \u2014 are \u201cbystanders,\u201d people who are scared that someone they know or love is a white supremacist. And most of those bystanders are parents of teens and young adults.\n\nHe\u2019s noticed that he hears from them most often after a high-profile act of violence, such as the 2012 shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that left six people dead (\u201cbefore that was the last time I had a day off,\u201d he says). Or the 2018 mass shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Or the massacre of 22 shoppers at a Walmart in El Paso just last month.\n\n\u201cThose moments sometimes push parents to reach out,\u201d he says, \u201cto say, \u2018Okay, I can\u2019t ignore this anymore.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPicciolini was a lonely kid in 1987 \u2014 the son of Italian immigrants who were loving but often absent, working long hours \u2014 when he first met his neo-Nazi recruiter. The man strolled up to Picciolini as he smoked in an alley and plucked the joint from his lips: \u201cThe communists and the Jews want you to do that, to keep you docile,\u201d the man said. And the power of that moment, Picciolini recalls, didn\u2019t lie in the words the recruiter spoke but in how he made Picciolini feel: like he mattered.\n\n\u201cThe politics, the ideology wasn\u2019t attractive to me at all,\u201d Picciolini says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even understand it, at 14 years old. But what was attractive was the sense of the identity, community and purpose that the movement provided.\u201d\n\nThe dark alleys, the punk shows, the skate parks where Picciolini and his fellow neo-Nazis used to look for new targets have been replaced by vast digital hunting grounds. But the psychology behind their recruitment tactics is the same as it\u2019s ever been, he says.\n\nIn the wake of the Washingtonian article, many discussions focused on a particular quote \u2014 what the boy said about why he felt drawn to the extremist individuals he met online: \u201cI liked them because they were adults and they thought I was an adult. I was one of them,\u201d he had told his mother. \u201cThey took me seriously. . . . They treated me like a rational human being, and they never laughed at me.\u201d\n\nFor kids between ages 11 and 15, especially, this sense of inclusion is an incredibly powerful lure, says Gil Noam, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital whose research focuses on child and adolescent development.\n\n\u201cIn this stage, the issue is not so much \u2018Who am I?\u2019 but rather, \u2018Where do I belong?\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201c \u2018Who includes me? Who treats me well?\u2019 \u201d\n\nExtremist recruiters understand, Noam says, that a child at this age is more likely to respond to the pull of community and a sense of purpose, even if they don\u2019t readily identify with a group\u2019s core message. For parents who struggle to understand how extremist indoctrination can happen to \u201cgood\u201d kids, he says, it\u2019s helpful to keep this developmental vulnerability in mind.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t unique to young white boys in America in 2019: \u201cEven with the Hitler Youth,\u201d Noam says, referring to recruitment within the youth wing of the Nazi Party in Germany, \u201cwhat they really understood was the power of belonging.\u201d\n\nAlice LoCicero, a clinical psychologist and co-founder of the Society for Terrorism Research, saw similar patterns of behavior when she studied the recruitment of child soldiers by the militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cAbout age 13, kids have a big developmental shift, cognitively,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of idealism and altruism and wanting to make a difference in the world. It\u2019s an age where a sense of justice becomes really important, and that can be misconstrued and manipulated: Justice according to whom?\u201d\n\nVolunteering in the community, engaging with a new hobby, joining a mission-driven club or campaign \u2014 these might be ways to redirect a young person, LoCicero says.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that research has shown is that these kids who get recruited, they describe the need to have an impact,\u201d she says. \u201cAll kids need positive mentoring, and if we fail on that, then there are people out there who are only too happy to mentor them into violence.\u201d\n\nIn her Twitter thread, Schroeder offered advice for other parents, urging them to talk about these issues with kids in a way that avoids shame or defensiveness \u2014 emotions that might drive children away from their parents and toward extremist influences online. She described how she sat down with her kids so they could look through Instagram together and talk about what they saw: \u201cIt\u2019s such a good tool for parents, because there\u2019s no blame there,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gives you a peek into what your kids are seeing online and what the people they follow are sharing, but it doesn\u2019t come from a place of, \u2018Oh, you did this thing wrong.\u2019 \u201d\n\n[Perspective: White supremacists are recruiting white teens online. Parents must stop them.]\n\nNo teenager wants to feel like they\u2019re being manipulated, Schroeder says. So she talked to her boys about the power of propaganda.\n\n\u201cWhat I said that connected with them really well was, \u2018These people are trying to pull the wool over your eyes \u2014 they\u2019re trying to trick you,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cI told them, \u2018They\u2019re trying to get you to believe something that, if you think about it, you really don\u2019t believe.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNoam, the Harvard psychologist, agrees that this sort of approach \u2014 an open conversation, where the child feels valued and taken seriously \u2014 is the best way for parents to navigate this delicate territory.\n\n\u201cEngaging in a dialogue in a way that is not lecturing and that doesn\u2019t make the parent\u2019s anxiety the main focus, that\u2019s the way to go,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd don\u2019t immediately envision a catastrophic outcome, Noam adds: It\u2019s possible to turn these patterns around if the underlying need is understood and met.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any kid who says: \u2018I can\u2019t wait to grow up and become a Nazi. I can\u2019t wait to grow up and hate somebody else,\u2019 \u201d Picciolini says. \u201cThese are manifestations of despair. It\u2019s a last-ditch thing. We have to understand our children and what engages them at the youngest age possible, so that they have access to opportunities that will get them involved in something positive.\u201d", "description": "Extremist groups are targeting kids in a vulnerable developmental stage.", "authors": ["Caitlin Gibson", "Feature Writer", "September At Am", "Caitlin Gibson Is A Feature Writer At The Washington Post.
