How very \u2018Putin-esque\u2019 of her.\n\nUnfounded blaming of Russia for her own woes is nothing new from Hillary Clinton, who still blames the Kremlin for denying her the presidency three years ago. If it wasn\u2019t \u2018Russian hackers\u2019 leaking her emails, it was \u2018Russian bots\u2019 backing Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, or Vladimir Putin convincing the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein to mount a third-party challenge. Though none of these accusations were founded in reality, Russia-bashing has become Clinton\u2019s stock in trade.\n\nHer suggestion last week that \u201cthe Russians\u201d were \u201cgrooming\u201d 2020 candidate Tulsi Gabbard to run as a third-party candidate next year to split the Democratic vote was nothing surprising, especially as Gabbard\u2019s foreign policies \u2013 opposition to \u201cregime change wars\u201d and support for better Washington-Moscow ties \u2013 have seen her campaign smeared from the get go.\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption': Tulsi Gabbard DRAGS Hillary Clinton after 'Russian asset' claim\n\nAside from once again making Clinton the poster-child for \u2018Russiagate\u2019 delusion, that statement succeeded in causing some internal ructions within the party and its supporters in the media.\n\nThere were those who distanced themselves from Clinton. Fringe candidates Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson defended Gabbard, with Williamson accusing Clinton of \u201cthe character assassination of women who don\u2019t toe the party line,\u201d and Yang commending Gabbard\u2019s military service (In the US military, not Russia\u2019s).\n\n\u201cTulsi is not being groomed by anyone,\" Texas Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke added on Saturday, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday that \"statements like that ought to be backed by evidence.\"\n\nEven Tapper called Clinton\u2019s claim an \u201cobvious smear\u201d and a \u201cwild accusation.\u201d Fellow CNN host Van Jones accused the former contender of playing \u201ca very dangerous game,\u201d and denounced her for giving Gabbard \u201cpayback hell\u201d for quitting the DNC and supporting Bernie Sanders in 2016.\n\nVan Jones says Hillary Clinton smeared Tulsi Gabbard \u201cwith no facts\u201d & adds Tulsi is getting \u201cpayback hell\u201d for quitting DNC & backing Bernie in 2016 pic.twitter.com/jzGdmLMJzL \u2014 Ibrahim (@ibrahimpols) October 19, 2019\n\nThen there were those who remained silent. Frontrunners Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have kept mum on the scandal, save for a Sanders aide commenting on Twitter. Online debate among Democrats has raged over whether their silence is a refusal to add oxygen to the fire, or an endorsement of Clinton\u2019s position.\n\nRemember when @TulsiGabbard resigned as Vice Chair of the DNC to endorse @BernieSanders in 2016? It was such a huge coup for him, Bernie made a whole campaign ad featuring Tulsi. Time to return the favor, Senator Sanders. pic.twitter.com/0FdSmtL7C5 \u2014 Sharmine Narwani (@snarwani) October 19, 2019\n\nHow everyone looks right now waiting on Bernie Sanders to defend Tulsi Gabbard from Hillary Clinton pic.twitter.com/sT8Rr3k1fL \u2014 Basic Bisexual Bitch\ud83d\udd78\ufe0f (@antiwarmisfit) October 19, 2019\n\nAnd to establishment Democrats who\u2019ve long ago swallowed the Russian kool-aid, anyone backing Gabbard here is now a Russian asset by association.\n\nTulsi Gabbard is still listed as a Fellow of the Sanders Institute. Right now. Tonight. She was closely associated with his last campaign, and is supported by many of his most ardent followers. Bernie must disavow all association with Gabbard. https://t.co/kbWxnIR7mZ \u2014 Tom Watson (@tomwatson) October 18, 2019\n\nDivision and discord. Exactly what Russiagaters spent the last two years accusing Moscow of sowing in the US. But there\u2019s no need to hire hackers and pump out fake news when Hillary Clinton is more than willing to do the legwork herself.\n\nClinton once insisted that her party protect its own, declaring earlier this year that criticism of California Senator Kamala Harris \u2013 an establishment favorite \u2013 was both sexist and a betrayal of party values.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to support Democrats,\u201d she said, \u201cthen go somewhere else.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton about the attacks on Kamala Harris: \u201cIt feeds into sexism and misogyny. She\u2019s being attacked by the left. Enough. If you don\u2019t want to support Democrats, go somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso, racism. pic.twitter.com/HuRQGQHhG3 \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) January 26, 2019\n\nWhen Harris was smeared this summer by right-wing trolls who questioned whether she was \u201cblack enough\u201d to discuss racial issues, the entire crop of 2020 candidates rushed to her defense. \u201cKamala Harris doesn\u2019t have shit to prove,\u201d tweeted New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Biden called the smear \u201cdisgusting,\u201d Warren said it was \u201cracist and ugly,\u201d and Sanders called it simply \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nNo such luck for Tulsi Gabbard. For all her talk of party unity and supporting Democrats above all, Clinton is clearly only willing to support the right kind of Democrat. What her party should realize is that internal division, the settling of old scores, and the constant resuscitation of Russiagate conspiracy theories may cost them dearly in the runup to next year\u2019s election.\n\nBy Graham Dockery, RT\n\nLike this story?
