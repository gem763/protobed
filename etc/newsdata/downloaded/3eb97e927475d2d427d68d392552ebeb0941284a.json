REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\nThis week officials set up what they called a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for displaced students ages 4 to 19 inside the Thomas A. Robinson National Stadium in Nassau, the island-nation\u2019s capital city.\n\nHundreds of young people lined up inside the sports arena\u2019s dimly lit hallways on Thursday, waiting for vision and hearing exams, immunizations, clothing, school supplies, and referrals for counseling with volunteer psychologists.\n\nAs a thunderstorm bellowed outside the arena and another tropical storm headed toward the country, parents who had evacuated from the northern islands cradled babies, while young boys playfully chased one another.\n\n\u201cThese kids need their education, how are they going to get jobs or have any options?\u201d said Chandra Alexis, an 18-year-old evacuee from the devastated northern island of Great Abaco, about 150 km north of Nassau.\n\n\u201cWe lost everything; without school there\u2019s nothing,\u201d Alexis said while waiting in line to find out which schools her younger sister and cousin would attend.\n\nHurricane Dorian, one of the most powerful storms in the country\u2019s recorded history, made landfall on Sept. 1 with top sustained winds of 185 miles per hour (298 kph) and lingered over the northern Bahamas for nearly 50 hours. It damaged or destroyed nearly every structure on Abaco and battered nearby Grand Bahama.\n\nAbaco had 17 schools, most of them public, and Grand Bahama had about 20, said Belinda Wilson, president of Bahamas Union of Teachers. She said all of the union\u2019s members on the two islands were located and safe.\n\nThe Bahamian government on Thursday said 1,300 people were officially listed as missing, and aid groups were rushing to bring in basic supplies ahead of a new storm system that was expected to hamper some relief efforts on Friday and Saturday.\n\nBahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis on Wednesday said the official death toll stood at 50 but was expected to rise. The Bahamian government has requested 500 body bags, according to a report from the Pan-American Health Organization.\n\nDue to a computer glitch, students at the sports arena were unable to find out where on New Providence Island, home of the capital, they would go to school this year. Many said they were told to return the next day.\n\nOfficials said they hoped fewer than 10,000 students would need placements. They plan to distribute them at schools across the islands with a total of 400,000 residents.\n\nPublic schools on most islands opened on Sept. 9, a week behind schedule. Schools remained shut on Abaco and Grand Bahama, two of the hardest-hit northern islands.\n\nEngineers were still assessing the safety of school buildings on Grand Bahama.\n\n\u201cThe union\u2019s position is that no teacher, and by extension no student, is going to enter any of those buildings until an engineer is able to say to that those schools are structurally sound,\u201d said Wilson.\n\n\u2018NORMALIZE THEIR LIVES\u2019\n\n\u201cOur role is to get kids in schools so that they\u2019re not further disadvantaged or further traumatized,\u201d said Lorraine Armbrister, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Education. \u201cWe want to normalize their lives as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAs a first step, the government is registering evacuees living in temporary shelters in the capital. It will soon invite those staying in Nassau hotels or with friends and family to make appointments to secure classroom seats.\n\nThe government expected to have data on the maximum capacity of every school by next week, Armbrister said, enabling officials to make a better assessment of the overall need.\n\nWilson said New Providence schools may not have enough room for all the displaced children evacuated to the capital.\n\n\u201cThere are many other islands that could accommodate students,\u201d said Wilson, adding that her union represented about 4,000 teachers on 24 islands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take all of our imagination to look at how we can redeploy teachers and their families along with parents and students to some of the other islands,\u201d she said.\n\nUNICEF, which is partnering the Bahamian Education Ministry, said registration would roll out to other islands in the coming days.\n\nRegistration will last until Oct. 12 but an extension is possible if needed, Armbrister said. With every student needing health exams, education officials are able to process only about 200 to 300 students per day.", "description": "Bahamian education officials are scrambling to find classroom space for up to 10,000 students displaced by Hurricane Dorian after the Category 5 storm ravaged two of the archipelago\u2019s northern islands, destroying many school buildings.", "authors": ["Zachery Fagenson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429554450&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1RV", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
