Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nWe are no different to the rest of the country in that most in the North share the same Yellowhammer concerns about food and medicine shortages, peace on the island of Ireland, and the disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable people in society.\n\nBut there are parts of our region which are so heavily reliant on manufacturing and exporting to the EU that entire communities will be decimated.\n\nIn the North East, for example, there will be an 11 per cent drop in the value of goods we produce if no deal and a 6 per cent drop with Johnson\u2019s new proposal. This will devastate communities.\n\nMake no mistake, Johnson\u2019s proposal is far worse than Theresa May\u2019s deal, and that was bad enough. Our country will have to borrow more and so will go further into debt for our kids to pay. Wages are estimated to go down by over 6 per cent costing every single person thousands. And manufacturing will be hit due to increased trading barriers.\n\nBusiness is already bracing itself. In fact, the latest figures for the North West showed its economy shrinking and the North East Chamber of Commerce reported the lowest volume of export orders since 2009 \u2013 during the very depths of the recession that followed the financial crash.\n\nCompanies crucial to our region like Nissan, which employs 6,000 people on Wearside in the North East, with thousands of thousands in the supply chain, have said their entire business model would be \u201cin jeopardy\u201d. Vauxhall, in the North West, has said its plant is conditional on our relationship with the European Union.\n\nThousands of jobs lost. Thousands of families struggling to keep a roof over their head, food on the table, and their kids warm over Christmas.\n\nWhich is the second reason why so many will be travelling to London. Because Boris Johnson does not care about the North. He only cares about the votes in the North.\n\nYou will see him in hospitals, or in front of police, or making more false promises about investment. You will hear the Old Etonian dismiss the warnings of business by saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think the consequences of a No Deal will be anything like as bad as you say\u201d because he will be OK. People like him always are.\n\nYou will not see him at a foodbank. You will not see him giving those on their knees due to austerity a helping hand.\n\nInstead, like Nigel Farage, he will just talk about us as a heaving mass of angry working-class who all voted Leave with nothing in between.\n\nWhich is the third reason why the North is going to London: to speak for ourselves.\n\nBecause despite the Northern narrative pushed for general election purposes, we are not all angry Leavers. In fact, a recent YouGov poll showed 57 per cent of people in the North would choose Remain over no deal or even Remain over a deal with the backstop removed akin to Johnson\u2019s proposal. And the vast majority of people who voted Leave were middle class (59 per cent) not working class (41 per cent).\n\nIt is why I worked with Peter Kyle to ensure that whatever deal is passed goes back to the people. To ensure the North\u2019s true voice is heard on Brexit in a referendum separate from the politics of a general election which sees us lumped together as one entity.\n\nAnd it is why we march together in London.\n\nNot to see a cup raised aloft this time, but to see the hopes raised of all those whose jobs are at risk and who care about the future of our country. Not to see one side win over another but to ensure all sides are heard on the defining issue of our generation for one last time. That is our cup final on 19 October, to demand we are given a Final Say.\n\nPhil Wilson is Labour MP for Sedgefield.", "description": "When the cost of trains to the capital goes through the roof and hotel rooms can barely be found.
