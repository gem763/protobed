It\u2019s a model we\u2019ve also seen from the folks at Modsy, Havenly puts a bit more of an emphasis on pairing users with an individual designer who they can chat with on the phone and share their hopes for the space, something CEO Lee Mayer says can help make the space feel more customized to them.\n\n\u201cYour home is very personal, if you and I show up to work one day and we have the same shirt, that may not be that weird. It is a little weird if I walk into your living room and it looks exactly like mine,\u201d Mayer tells TechCrunch.\n\nThe big evolution with this raise will be that Havenly is going to start putting its own products into the mix with a private label called Cove Goods. The line largely seems to be focused on accent pieces, but they are working on some furniture as well.\n\nPricing for their services sits between $69 and $99 depending on whether you\u2019re starting from a blank slate or just want some additional pieces recommended to you that you can buy through the platform. The startup can also send you custom floor plans and layout renders to show you what your space will look like.\n\nHavenly has now raised $57.8 million. Series C investors included Foundry Group, Lerer Hippeau, Kickstart Ventures and Gingerbread Capital.", "description": "Interior design platform Havenly is raising $32 million in new funding to create its first private label brand as the startup aims to integrate its own products into its design recommendation engine.
