The firm had been embroiled in its own controversy when it had its TV advertising campaign, featuring Katona, banned because the regulators deemed that it encouraged debt to fund a celebrity lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThe former member of Atomic Kitten continued to advertise the payday loan firm until earlier this week.\n\n\n\nYou've got to be kitten me: Kerry Katona has been dropped as the face of payday loan company, Cash Lady, after being declared bankrupt for the second time.\n\nOn confirming that Katona had been made bankrupt, on her own petition, we contacted Cash Lady for a comment.\n\n\n\nA spokesman told us that they were dropping Katona from their ads and her picture has since been removed from their website.\n\nEarli er this year Katona wrote a blog for the Huffington Post w here she defended her choice to promote the short term lender given the controversy that the industry has faced in recent months.\n\n\n\nIn the piece she said: \u2018CashLady.co.uk is ONLY designed for people who have a job which is why I agreed to do it.\u2019\n\n\n\nOne This is Money reader, Zeke, contacted us to say that this wasn\u2019t the case. He explained that, after seeing the ad, he had applied for a \u00a3300 loan through Cash Lady as an unemployed eighteen-year-old presuming that he\u2019d be turned immediately down.\n\n\n\nThe result? They offered him a \u00a3500 loan. (See the screen grabs from hi s blog b elow.)\n\nApply please: A screengrab from the Cash Lady website that appeared on a This is Money readers blog after he applied for a loan.\n\nLoan please: The page that Zeke was directed too when he applied for the loan.\n\nZeke said that he was unemployed but that he had a monthly income of \u00a3600. A loan of \u00a3500, designed to be repaid with interest within one month, would wipe out nearly all of this.\n\n\n\nZeke emailed us to question whether this was responsible lending. A great question. We put it to Cash Lady.\n\n\n\nDespite the Cash Lady website seeming to offer Zeke a \u00a3500 loan, a spokesman said that \u2018Cash Lady is a broker, not a lender\u2019 and therefore 'would not have been involved in the decision making process as to whether or not he would be offered credit'.\n\n\n\nCash Lady added that if Zeke had continued the application then he would have been referred to a lender which offers guarantor loans, rather than a payday loan that is unsecured. It says this is responsible.\n\n\n\nThe spokesman continued: \u2018The second set of screenshots (starting with \"Zeke we can lend you \u00a3500\") didn\u2019t come from us. Our application form doesn\u2019t ask for full debit card details, as we don\u2019t handle any transactions.\n\n\n\nSpam: Zeke set up a new email address to apply for the loan and was bombarded with emails from similar lenders\n\n'We ask for their bank account details and to verify that they have a debit card, and that information gets sent to whichever lender provisionally accepts the application, if any do.\u2019\n\n\n\n'Once he applied with us, his application information went through to the list of lenders we work with, and FLM Quick provisionally accepted the application.\n\n\n\n'He then would have been transferred through to them, and it would have been clear that he was being transferred to a third party. The application for a guarantor loan would have happened with them.\u2019\n\nBut Zeke didn't understand that Cash Lady was a broker and not a lender, or that he was being transferred from Cash Lady to another company mid-way through his application.\n\n\n\nI suspect a lot of the population would struggle to understand this difference.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Zeke set up an email address to apply for the loan and over the next few days he was inundated with emails from similar lenders.\n\nPayday lenders have faced much scrutiny over the past year. The Office of Fair Trading has referred the industry to the Competition Commission and the Financial Conduct Authority are set to take over regulation of the sector next April.\n\n\n\nI think there is an important lesson here for the government and regulators \u2013 it\u2019s not just the lenders that need tighter regulation, it\u2019s brokers, just like Cash Lady.\n\n", "description": "He applied for a \u00a3300 loan through Cash Lady as an unemployed eighteen-year-old presuming that he\u2019d be turned down.
