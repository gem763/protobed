Saudi-led coalitions have launched military campaigns to stem the Houthis\u2019 expansion.\n\nOver the years, Saudi-led airstrikes have killed Yemeni civilians, while the Houthis have used drones and missiles to attack Saudi Arabia and have also targeted vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nSaturday\u2019s drone attack is being described as the biggest on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure since Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein in 1990s fired missiles into the kingdom during the first Gulf War.\n\nOn Saturday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran for the Saudi attacks. However, he also said there was no evidence that the weekend\u2019s drone strike came from Yemen.\n\n\u201cWe call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran\u2019s attacks. The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression,\u201d Pompeo said on Twitter.\n\nWe call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran\u2019s attacks. The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nIran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani has denied any involvement in the Saudi strikes.\n\nAFP/Getty Images A picture taken on September 15, 2019 shows an Aramco oil facility near al-Khurj area, just south of the Saudi capital Riyadh. - Saudi Arabia raced today to restart operations at oil plants hit by drone attacks.\n\nThe drone attack also comes amid tensions between Tehran and Washington after the U.S. pulled out of a global nuclear pact and imposed fresh sanctions against Iran to force it to curb its ambitions to create a nuclear-weapons program.\n\nWhat does it mean for oil prices?\n\nHelima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said the weekend escalation could prove a \u201cgame changer\u201d for the dynamic in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWe contend that this morning\u2019s drone attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s all important Abqaiq processing facility (which has processing capacity of more than 7 [million barrels a day]) and the 1.5 mb/d Khurais oil field represents a game changer in the escalating Iranian regional standoff,\u201d Croft wrote in a Saturday research report titled: \u201cSaudi Arabia/Iran Crisis Guide Update: This is Your Wake Up Call\u2026\u201d\n\nIndeed, West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV19, +9.90% was surging 10.5%, up $5.78, to $60.63 a barrel on Sunday. Brent crude prices for November delivery BRNX19, +11.21%, the global benchmark, initially shot up 18% as trading began late Sunday, but was most recently up $6.96, or 11.6%, to $67.18 a barrel.\n\nMeanwhile, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00, -0.58% slid more than 150 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 futures ES00, -0.67% and Nasdaq Composite futures NQ00, -1.14% also fell.\n\nS&P Global Platts estimated that Brent oil, the international benchmark, could see a $5 or $10 price surge from its current levels.\n\n\u201cWhile some commentators may call for triple-digit oil prices we would suggest that the sudden change in geopolitical risk warrants not only an elimination of the $5-10/Bbl discount on bearish sentiment, but adds a potential $5-10/Bbl premium to account for now-undeniably high Middle Eastern dangers to supply and the sudden elimination of spare capacity,\u201d the Platts researchers wrote.\n\n\u201cAs such prices are likely to break out of the current $55-65/Bbl options range, to test the high $70s as currently supported by fundamentals,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nCroft said Saturday\u2019s major incident raises the risk of further disruptions to Middle East output that likely elevates the risk of oil prices vaulting higher (see map below via RBC Capital Markets showing recent incidents):\n\nvia RBC Capital Markets\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that 5 million barrels a day of output, or some 5% of world supply, would be taken offline due to the strikes. Saudi officials have said that it expects to resume one-third of normal output by Monday, but experts say that it would take weeks for the facilities to reach full capacity.\n\n\u201cThis could take a longer time than the authorities initially are claiming. Despite lower exports this year, Saudi Arabia has also depleted its crude oil stocks to the lowest levels in 10 years, so the country alone does not have the same robustness to Middle East interruptions as it used to have,\u201d wrote Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, head of oil market analysis at Rystad Energy, in a Sunday research note.\n\n\u201cThe air attack by Iranian backed militia on vital oil processing terminals in the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil region has turned the market on its head over the weekend,\u201d said Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis at Rystad.\n\nPrice Futures Group\u2019s Flynn suggested that the world-wide global oil reserves may need to be tapped to stem a big surge in prices.\n\n\u201cGlobal strategic reserve will have to be used to avoid a major price spike. Not only will oil focus on when the processing plant will return but also to whether it can be secured,\u201d he said.\n\nTonhaugen said he doubts that the U.S. will be able to effectively mitigate a price surge in the near term. \u201cAlso, the U.S. cannot quickly replace this volume, as it takes time to relocate oil tankers, and U.S. still has limited export capacity by Very Large Crude Carriers, (known as VLCCs),\u201d he said.\n\nFlynn agrees: \u201cThis is a historic event and may have ramifications for years to come. Another key is security. How can Saudi Arabia secure their oil fields in the future? We may now find how quickly shale can ramp up. I am afraid it won\u2019t be fast enough.\u201d\n\nHow will the broader market react?\n\nAlready Saudi Arabia\u2019s Tadawul stock-market exchange is under pressure and that could have some spillover into U.S. trading early Monday. Bloomberg News reported that the Tadawul All Share Index was down 3.1% after the attack. On Monday, exchange-traded fund iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF KSA, +0.41%, a popular way to gain exposure to Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil market, is likely to be active. The Saudi ETF has gained 2.8% so far in 2019, and a sharp downturn could erase its year-to-date gains.\n\nThe Middle East tensions come as markets are on the brink of all-time highs and as the Federal Reserve on Wednesday is set to weigh signs of global economic slowdown and stubbornly low inflation as it prepares to set monetary policy.\n\nAs of Friday, the Dow DJIA, +0.14% was 0.5% from its record at 27,359.16 hit on July 15, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.07% stood about the same distance from its all-time peak at 3,025.86 set on July 26. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.22% was 1.8% from its all-time closing high at 8,330.21 also hit on July 26.\n\nThe U.S. central bank has traditionally described moves in the volatile oil markets as inputs that central bankers tend to view as temporary.", "description": "An intensifying Middle East conflict is threatening to throw the world\u2019s energy market into disarray after a weekend drone attack destroyed parts of Saudi...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR321_drone__ZG_20190915112220.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
