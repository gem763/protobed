Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Jessica Brooks / Amazon\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have one of the most memorable days of our artistic lives!\u201d Standing in Griffith Park among a grove of cedars overlooking Los Angeles, Transparent creator Jill Soloway bellows a kind of invocation to a crowd of approximately 150 people, more than half of whom are dressed in Technicolor costumes. The cast and crew are here on this chilly January morning, along with several busloads of dancers and extras, to help Soloway bring the series to an end with a movie-musical-style finale: an all-hands-on-deck song-and-dance number called \u201cJoyocaust.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreathe in the knowledge that you\u2019re in the exact right place,\u201d Soloway continues, as heads bow all around them. \u201cThere\u2019s no right or wrong, no getting in trouble. Channel the feeling of utter joy onto your face and body because that\u2019s what this is\u2014a dream of a future world that we\u2019re living in today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we could also take a moment to acknowledge that this land belonged to people before we were here,\u201d producer and co-star Shakina Nayfack adds, \u201cand to ask for permission from the spirits to honor them in this thing we\u2019re creating.\u201d The chorus of cheers is so loud a crew member must deliver one final order of business via megaphone: \u201cThere is an imminent threat of poison oak! Please don\u2019t be reaching out and touching anything.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, it seems like any other day on a Transparent set. Ever since the Amazon series premiered in 2014, Soloway has tried to create an environment that would allow the cast to feel comfortable with the intimacy expected of them. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about it a lot, but Transparent was a hard show to do,\u201d says co-star Jay Duplass, who plays the feckless Josh Pfefferman. \u201cFrom crazy sex scenes to baring your soul\u2014it\u2019s very rigorous.\u201d This morning\u2019s benediction is an abbreviated version of a long-standing tradition the showrunner calls \u201cbox,\u201d in which everybody is invited to share experiences from their daily lives. \u201cVulnerability works like glue,\u201d says Soloway, who came out as gender nonbinary in 2016 (they prefer the third-person pronoun). \u201cThat kind of connection makes the day go faster.\u201d\n\nThat circle of trust was broken last year when the show\u2019s star, Jeffrey Tambor, was fired after being accused of sexual harassment by two of his trans colleagues\u2014his former assistant Van Barnes and his co-star Trace Lysette. For four seasons, Tambor anchored Transparent as Maura Pfefferman, a father who comes out as transgender and inspires her family members to examine their own uneasy identities. Though there was skepticism from the start about casting a cis man in the role, the show was widely embraced by critics as groundbreaking. It won eight Emmys. Two of them were for Tambor\u2019s performance. Now Soloway had no choice but to kill off the series\u2019 protagonist, along with the series, and they had decided to do so in a movie-musical finale. \u201cEverything burned to the ground,\u201d Soloway says simply.\n\nThe act of staging a musical quickly became part of the healing process. \u201cThe whole thing is so meta,\u201d Soloway muses. \u201cJoyocaust\u201d in particular is about finding new ways to cope with pain. It is the series\u2019 fait accompli, a powerful, exuberantly orchestrated ensemble piece in which pleasure is presented as a form of resistance to living in terrorized spaces. The song also closes in on perhaps the show\u2019s greatest legacy. Over the years, as Transparent interrogated gender identity and challenged taboos, the horror of the Holocaust remained in its DNA; the idea of inherited trauma was often presented as inseparable from the characters\u2019 suffering. Previous seasons flashed back to Nazi Germany and sent the Pfefferman family on a fraught trip to Israel. Soloway wonders if \u201cthe whole reason we did the show was so we could do \u2018Joyocaust.\u2019\u201d\n\nIndeed, it might seem almost too on-the-nose that Transparent would end this way, with an over-the-top reverie about the Holocaust, complete with Munchkin-worthy costumes. In the movie, the song follows the shiva for Maura. Mourners pass through a portal, which is actually just a hole in a chain-link fence behind the Pfefferman home, to rejoice with loved ones in a radical queer paradise. Their mournful black attire abruptly transforms into a rainbow of outfits. Maura\u2019s ex-wife, Shelly\u2014Judith Light, clad in a lemon-yellow tuxedo\u2014leads the procession with Barnum & Bailey bravado, singing, \u201cTake the concentration out of camps / And concentrate it on some song and dance.\u201d It\u2019s Peak Transparent\u2014earnest, absurdist, with a wink of self-awareness.\n\nBut it\u2019s also an ending that could only make sense post-Tambor. The lyrics look forward, offering a promise for moving through the #MeToo era. \u201cThis time, if something\u2019s wrong,\u201d Soloway says, paraphrasing the song\u2019s message, \u201cI want to know. I won\u2019t look away.\u201d\n\nAt the time the accusations came to light, Soloway was dreaming up story lines for season five. Changes were in store for all the characters: Maura was going to befriend a group of hackers and try to recapture her youth; her daughter Sarah, played by Amy Landecker, was expanding her marriage to become a throuple. Several more seasons were assumed to be on the horizon. \u201cI bought a house, and my Realtor tried to convince me to spend even more because she\u2019s like, \u2018You\u2019re on a hit show,\u2019 \u201d recalls Landecker. \u201cHonestly, thank God I\u2019ve been so frugal my whole life.\u201d\n\nOver the next three months, an investigation into Tambor\u2019s alleged behavior followed. Soloway treads carefully when discussing this period. \u201cThe complexity of what went on is so nuanced,\u201d they say. \u201cAll of us had a lot of mercy for everybody involved. It was deep. We did a lot of processing.\u201d Lysette, who plays Maura\u2019s friend Shea, remembers those months as the \u201cblack-sheep period.\u201d Lysette went public with her story, telling The Hollywood Reporter that while filming a scene in the show\u2019s second season, Tambor pushed himself against her and said, \u201cMy God, Trace, I want to attack you sexually.\u201d (Tambor has denied the allegations.) In their 2018 memoir, She Wants It, Soloway admits to initially feeling injured by the public nature of the allegations. Lysette recalls the two of them having \u201ca full-on shouting match\u201d on the Paramount lot. Eventually, she says, the two reconciled. \u201cIt just took time for everyone to see the truth,\u201d Lysette says. \u201cOnce [the investigation] came together, I started to feel a shift from Amazon and Jill. I was getting reaffirmed, like, \u2018Hey, you did a brave thing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to sound a little psychotic, but Maura and Jeffrey are two different entities for me. I\u2019m still coming through my mourning process. \u2014 Alexandra Billings\n\nThe idea to end the series with a movie musical was first broached on a walk Soloway took with their sister, Faith, who served as a writer and consulting producer, in Griffith Park, shortly after Tambor was fired. Music had always played a big role in Transparent. The fourth season featured songs from Jesus Christ Superstar, and Faith had been composing songs for a stage production ever since the show premiered. In the summer of 2017, before what both siblings refer to now as \u201cthe reckoning,\u201d she hosted a two-night performance at Joe\u2019s Pub prophetically titled Should Transparent Become a Musical?, featuring a mix of ballads, choral numbers, and vaudeville inspired by the musicals she and Soloway loved as children growing up in Chicago: Hair, Fiddler on the Roof, Sweet Charity. \u201cWe started to realize that a regular season wouldn\u2019t be enough,\u201d says Soloway. \u201cPeople sing when they can\u2019t find the words.\u201d\n\nIn June 2018, the cast gathered for a workshop at Nayfack\u2019s Musical Theatre Factory in New York. It was the first time they\u2019d all gathered since the scandal broke. Gaby Hoffmann, who plays Ari, the youngest of the desultory Pfefferman children, remembers it as a crucial step forward. \u201cA lot of people needed to say a lot of things and be heard and explore different feelings about the whole process,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, it was nice to just be together. That was everybody\u2019s initial response to things starting to come apart\u2013\u2013just, like, can we get in the same room?\u201d\n\nThough the Pfefferman family had stayed in touch throughout the ordeal, moving forward was a fragile prospect. \u201cThere\u2019s no getting around how devastating it was,\u201d says Landecker. \u201cWe felt like, Well, what\u2019s the show without Jeffrey?\u201d Alexandra Billings\u2014who, along with Lysette, is one of two recurring trans cast members\u2014still hasn\u2019t fully dealt with her emotions. \u201cMy whole energy was wrapped up in standing with my trans sisters,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sound a little psychotic, but Maura and Jeffrey are two different entities for me. I\u2019m still coming through my mourning process.\u201d\n\nIn December 2018, they gathered in Los Angeles to shoot the finale over the course of 20 days. \u201cWe all wanted to have a different ending that wasn\u2019t trauma,\u201d Soloway says. \u201cThis was a way to process the loss.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere on this final day of production is like a \u201chappy funeral,\u201d as Duplass puts it. Soloway calls \u201cJoyocaust\u201d \u201cthe \u2018Everybody in Springfield\u2019 number,\u201d because a surprising number of guest stars returned for it. When the music starts, a spry Cherry Jones goes skipping around a tree, joined by Tig Notaro, Melora Hardin, Bradley Whitford, Alia Shawkat, Michaela Watkins, and Jason Mantzoukas. \u201cEverywhere you look, it\u2019s someone who could have their own show,\u201d says Landecker. \u201cBut they just showed up to dance in the woods for love of Transparent.\u201d\n\nCast and crew alike are wearing name tags with their preferred pronouns. Between shots, Hoffmann sits on a chair in the middle of the woods, breastfeeding her infant son as the hair and makeup team flutter around her. \u201cI did have a couple of moments where I realized, Oh, I totally take for granted that I\u2019m being supported not just as an artist but as a person, as a mother,\u201d she says. \u201cThat should be the status quo.\u201d\n\nTo help corral the crowd, Soloway begins dividing the mourners into two categories: \u201cthe Interestings\u201d and \u201cthe Absurds.\u201d The Interestings include Leslie (Jones) and Lyfe (Folake Olowofoyeku)\u2013\u2013former lovers of Ari who could conceivably be attending the Pfefferman shiva. The Absurds are people from the past, some deceased, whose memories have haunted the series, like Rita (Brett Paesel), the Pfeffermans\u2019 childhood babysitter who committed suicide in season three. In the dream logic of Soloway\u2019s Shangri-La, Maura\u2019s late grandmother (Watkins) plays in a klezmer band with Magnus (Whitford), a friend from her cross-dressing days. Eventually, they follow the Pfefferman clan to their individual hora circles in a swirl of lollipop hues.\n\nLandecker is standing in a huddle with Notaro and Hardin, who played an amusingly querulous couple on the series. \u201cTig\u2019s jazz hands are more like seal arms,\u201d she quips. Sure enough, when it comes time to shimmy through the portal and start exalting, the comedian and star of the Amazon series One Mississippi touches her shoulders and gestures to the sky with comically low energy.\n\nIn general, the finale \u2014 choreographed by Ryan Heffington, whose credits include the movements for The OA \u2014 leans into the relatively amateur abilities of the cast. \u201cThe goal was for each actor to really sing as their character, not perfectly like Broadway stars,\u201d says music producer Anne Preven. Still, the unfamiliar territory of musicals led to some stressful moments. \u201cI was very scared to sing, and I was kinda pissy because I felt really vulnerable,\u201d admits Landecker.\n\nA little before lunchtime, Light looks for direction from Soloway. \u201cShakina reaches to me desperately and I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she frets. The mourners are twirling their way through the woods, and Light wants to know how to react after she emerges from the portal with Nayfack. \u201cYou\u2019re recognizing a loved one you haven\u2019t seen in a while,\u201d advises Soloway.\n\nIt felt like the family reunion I always wanted but never got. \u2014 Trace Lysette\n\nNayfack\u2019s casting is especially poignant. In the finale, Shelly mounts a production about her life. This show-within-the-show allowed the Soloways to bring in professional singers from a previous Joe\u2019s Pub engagement \u2014 Jo Lampert, Lesli Margherita, and Erik Liberman \u2014 to serve as doppelgangers for the Pfefferman brood. Nayfack, who is trans, plays Maura. To some extent, Nayfack\u2019s role redeems what was considered Soloway\u2019s original sin: casting a cis man to play Maura in the first place. \u201cWe were always grappling with [that], and none of the things we said were excuses were really excuses,\u201d says Soloway. Nayfack adds, \u201cI appreciated the cultural revolution that Transparent ignited; however, I felt angry and betrayed [by Tambor\u2019s casting], and I was very open about that when I was brought into the project. The moment when I appear as Maura \u2013\u2013 that is absolution and restitution. It\u2019s like the chef kiss of the movie.\u201d\n\nBillings considers the finale a gift for the same reason. \u201c[Jeffrey\u2019s] ability to access this human being from inside his soul was remarkable,\u201d she says. \u201cThe good he left behind was the fact that he finally caught up with himself in his own behavior. And because that happened, the cis man playing a trans character went away.\u201d\n\nFor Lysette, who did not attend the New York workshop, the finale marks the first time she\u2019s returned to set since she accused Tambor of sexual harassment. \u201cThe vibe was certainly different, and I think that\u2019s in part due to the fact that Jeffrey was no longer there\u2014it was a little lighter,\u201d she says. She can be seen during \u201cJoyocaust\u201d spinning around in a sleek red dress at the center of a hora circle. \u201cIt felt like the family reunion I always wanted but never got.\u201d\n\nHeffington calls everyone over to demonstrate some warm-up exercises. For a few minutes, R\u00f6yksopp and Robyn\u2019s ethereal \u201cMonument\u201d wafts over the loudspeakers as the crowd stretches and practices exhalation exercises. When they\u2019re finished, Landecker announces she has some \u201cvery powerful\u201d CBD cream: \u201cAnyone who might be in pain, come see Feel Good Dr. Sarah.\u201d Several cast members flock to her. As the winter sun begins to set, the crowd poses for a group photo, smiling widely. The remaining Pfeffermans\u2013\u2013Light, Hoffmann, Landecker, and Duplass\u2013\u2013pull each other close. \u201cWe were laughing and crying and whispering to each other about how much we loved each other,\u201d Hoffman recalls. \u201cAnd we stayed in that hug for so long that when we came out of it, nobody else was around.\u201d\n\nTransparent: Musicale Finale is on Amazon Prime September 27.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 30, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
