Excuse the line but, my dad used to tell me this all the time, and it is imprinted in my brain.\n\nDo you trust what you see in the markets or what you're hearing about things on the periphery? There is so much pent up anxiety about the issues -- like trade, impeachment, global slowing, Fed policy and the economy. We want resolution to these and other issues, but first we have to overcome the anxiety of analysis -- or over-analysis.\n\nYou want to be involved, take advantage of someone's negligence or misfortune. But hold on a minute: What if that unfortunate soul is you? Were you paying attention to the signs of the market or some pundit's opinion? Did you take a dare?\n\nThe market is always the final arbiter on these things, and the wacky behavior of price recently is indicative of the uncertainty of the players. Given the potential for big moves up or down, volatility has risen sharply and stayed there for awhile. The term structure of volatility remains at levels where expected moves are more than 1% on a daily basis.\n\nAt a time when the U.S. economy seems to be the best house in a bad neighborhood, one would think risk levels to invest here in the U.S. would recede, but they have not. As much as the pundits and experts in the media would like to be correct in their predictions and assessments, the market often finds the truth on its own.\n\nIn this land of uncertainty and erratic price movement, it is best to take a more conservative and reserved approach. Remember, higher volatility isn't defined as downward movement, rather it means a wide range or dispersion of price. We abhor risk at all times (yes, we ALL do) if it means we could lose capital, so big moves up and down tend to give us an upset stomach.\n\nSome may tell you to \"embrace the volatility,\" or use drops to purchase more stock or buy calls. But is this the time to try and be opportunistic? I don't believe so, as it is better to wait for your pitch rather than swing for fences on something out of the strike zone. You'll find a much better chance to connect the ball with the bat.", "description": "There is too much volatility right now.
