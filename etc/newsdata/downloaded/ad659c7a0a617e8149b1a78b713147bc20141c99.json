They couple were due to get married next year.\n\nThe vehicle was seen veering across the motorway before it hit a lorry.\n\nNone of the others in the car suffered serious injury.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nEvans admitted causing death by careless driving when he appeared at Exeter Crown Court. He denied the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nJudge Timothy Rose adjourned that case for a trial next June but urged the prosecution to review the case and decide whether they will accept the lesser charge.\n\nHe said: \"This case goes back to January and it might be thought to be in the interest of everybody that it is brought to a relatively speedy conclusion.\n\n\"In the light of all the considerations, the sentencing powers for the lesser offence are more than adequate.\"\n\nPeter Coombe, defending, said the Crown Prosecution Service's own guidelines on cases concerning the death of loved ones in road accidents suggest they should not continue with the dangerous driving charge.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nHe said: \"I am surprised the prosecution have reached the decision, given that they had been in a relationship since they were 15, were engaged to be married, and had two children together.\"\n\nHe said Evans and Kayleigh had been sharing the driving and this was not a case of deliberately driving while suffering from sleep deprivation.\n\nRichard Crabb, prosecuting, said the current decision of the CPS is to proceed with a trial for causing death by dangerous driving, but the case will be reviewed.\n\nThe judge released Evans on bail and imposed an interim driving ban. He set a provisional trial date of June 23 next year.\n\nHer father Steve said: \"Kayleigh was our first daughter and we couldn\u2019t have asked for a better daughter.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"She brought so much joy to myself and Sarah, we are so proud of her. There will never be a day that goes by when we won\u2019t think of Kayleigh, she has left a huge hole in our hearts and will be sorely missed by the whole family. Her little sister Rosie misses her deeply.\"\n\nHer brother Sean said care worker Kayleigh was due to get married to Dominic in 2020.\n\nHe said: \"She was a fun-loving, easy going, kind of girl; she loved nothing more than her kids. She always thought about other people first, she always came last. She was much-loved by everyone in the community, she will be sorely missed by everyone.\n\n\"She loved going on holiday to Egypt, she would go two or three times a year, and had done for the last five years. It's just shocking - I'm heartbroken, everyone is heartbroken.\"", "description": "Kayleigh Gill, 22, later died in hospital as the family return back to Devon after a break in Egypt", "authors": ["Ted Davenport", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Bbc", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464572.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Kayleigh-Gill.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
