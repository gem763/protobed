The format of presentation, or process of viewing the documents, wasn't decided. The president has agreed to the move, the official added.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff told POLITICO on Tuesday night that he\u2019d received no word on whether the Trump administration would turn over the complaint. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe White House\u2019s decision to give lawmakers any information on the whistleblower complaint marks a major change of strategy for the administration, which originally seemed intent on keeping the complaint private. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, so far, has declined to turn over the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees as required by law. The White House counsel\u2019s office and Justice Department have spent the past few days reviewing whistleblower laws.\n\nThis stonewalling, combined with the president\u2019s July call with the president of Ukraine, prompted House Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Democrats felt like they finally had the right material to do so after months of launching various investigations into Trump\u2019s business dealings and his administration\u2019s policy decisions.\n\nTrump has already promised to release on Wednesday a transcript of his call with the president of Ukraine, during which he is said to have asked the foreign leader to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time,\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday between meetings with foreign leaders at the United Nations.\n\nBut liberal lawyers and Democratic lawmakers said only the whistleblower complaint can fully lay out the allegations against the president.\n\nThe three lawyers for the whistleblower, Andrew P. Bakaj, I. Charles McCullough III and Mark Zaid, praised the White House\u2019s decision to release the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the decision to release the whistleblower complaint as it establishes that, ultimately, the lawful whistleblower disclosure process can work. We await the release of the complaint in its totality,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nThe release of the call transcript, which is squarely in the administration\u2019s control, will likely come out first. The administration could use the sequencing of the release of information to its advantage by setting out the best possible story line for Trump early on, just as it did with the release of the Mueller report.\n\nMeanwhile, the whistleblower\u2019s legal team has been in touch with the House and Senate intelligence committees about potentially providing testimony. The whistleblower filed the complaint to the intelligence community inspector general in early August.\n\nAndrew Desiderio and Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump has approved releasing the document at the center of his latest standoff with lawmakers, a senior administration official said.", "authors": ["Nancy Cook"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WTWDQzpnReTT79pCqYP_PA--~B/aD00MDQ7dz03MjU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/d1664790-df11-11e9-bb6f-ef087b99bcc2", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
