It is a completely silent machine, an alien spacecraft, and pulses with orange-yellow tubes of coolant, which keep the graphics card and motherboard from melting out of it like an ice pop. This machine is used to kill people: three, so far, today, but there will be countless more over the next eight hours. Behind there\u2019s a looming greenscreen, as though Ball is an especially violent weather presenter; in front, a bank of four computer screens, each streaming an unending loop of information.\n\nBall is a gaming streamer. He started seven years ago on YouTube, then pivoted to Twitch. And now it supports him and a team of over 20. His house is the most beautiful home I\u2019ve ever been to. His kitchen is a palace and his dogs are adorable. I wonder briefly if anyone would pay to watch me play Fortnite in just my pants, and what dark, awful things I would do with the ensuing wealth. Ball specialises in tactical combat games where he chillingly explodes the heads of hundreds of competing gamers, and 507 people are watching him do it right now. They are following his antics through Twitch, a website where you can watch people doing things. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the entire concept. It feeds live from people\u2019s living rooms, bedrooms and dedicated gaming rooms, out to thousands of devices at once. If YouTube is a Fast & Furious-style summer blockbuster, Twitch is the concurrent Big Brother equivalent: live cameras, often at a fixed and unflattering angles, revelling in conversational silence. Though it started out as primarily for gamers, the site has since evolved into a teeming community with people existing, doing, being on camera, and essentially performing anything as long as it is live.\n\nTwitch started out for gamers, but now covers almost any live activity\n\nIt\u2019s weird that Twitch exists. It is weirder that culture has sharpened to a point where Twitch is a thing. And weirder still that Twitch is now one of the biggest websites on earth, with up to 500,000 performers streaming live on the platform every day and more than 1 million users watching them at any one time. The set-up, if you\u2019re unfamiliar, is this: you point a webcam at yourself and, as long as you remain more-or-less clothed, you are free to broadcast yourself doing whatever it is you do. People can watch for free, subscribe for a small monthly support- the-artist style fee, or just throw money at them in the form of credits, a digital version of pelting wads of cash at a street performer.\n\nTwitch started as a portal to stream games and people-watching-people-playing-video games is still central to the essence of what it is. But in the eight years since it started, the platform has evolved and mutated, a synonymous call and response with the community that helps shape and support it. So now you can stream yourself cooking, for instance, or getting ready to go out, or playing poker, or walking around a city with a GoPro attached to a special rod, whispering, chatting. If you can do it and a camera can be pointed at it, then Twitch can host it. And people will watch it.\n\nWhere this differs from other online video platforms is the sheer aliveness of it. If YouTube is for the jump-cut blockbuster movie versions of reality, then Twitch revels in the mediocrity, in the burble of half- conversation. It\u2019s reality without all the boring bits edited out \u2013 conversational lulls where a person talking to themselves alone in a room finally runs out of steam; gaps in the broadcast where someone goes out-of-shot to eat their dinner or go to the loo; mic-silences where someone\u2019s mum walks into shot to have a dull, administrative mum conversation with them. And that\u2019s how Twitch elevates from something that, on paper, should be entirely mediocre, but in practice becomes something that\u2019s half-entertainment, half-therapeutic.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Screen idol: some of Chris Ball\u2019s kit. Photograph: Theo McInnes/The Observer\n\nI never thought I\u2019d become the kind of person who watches other people play video games: some things, like hard drugs or drag racing, you always assume you are too sensible for. But after a particularly life-uprooting break-up and a period of at-home confinement while I wrote a book, I found myself bizarrely drawn to Twitch, the soothing hypnotism of watching mostly silently men down energy drinks and kill other players, bathed in the blue light of their computer screens. Though I own video games, I suck at them, and watching professional gamers do what they do is akin to watching Lionel Messi weaving through a defence while I try to do 10 kick-ups in a row.\n\nTwitch is characterised by the undulating stream of chat that sits alongside the action: little enclaves of in-jokes, catchphrases and anonymous screen-names, which you at first ignore then, slowly, find yourself drawn to. \u201cSick kill!\u201d I typed once, into a darkly backlit chatbox, after one of my favourite streamers did a particularly sick kill. And the streamer said back to me: \u201cThanks.\u201d You can talk to the TV, now, and the TV can talk back. You can ask the TV if it can throw a grenade out of a helicopter.\n\nFrom a commercial and logical aspect, nothing about Twitch makes much sense. If you pitched the idea of it to TV giants in 2011, you\u2019d be laughed out of the room. But Twitch is indicative of the way the internet is shaping itself into the things people like to consume. It\u2019s a sort of self-fulfilling content machine in which the niche becomes broad. Nothing about fitness coach Joe Wicks made sense until he had a million followers; nothing about cleanfluencer Mrs Hinch made sense until she became a phenomenon. Twitch fits into that same niche. Which means watching other people play videogames is now a multibillion- dollar business.\n\nTo understand why this is, I decide to call my cousin Elijah, 12. It is initially hard to get him on the phone because he is too busy on PlayStation. \u201cDo you like Ninja?\u201d I ask him. Ninja is the biggest gaming streamer in the world \u2013 he made a reported $10m (\u00a38.2m) last year from streaming himself near wordlessly playing one of the world\u2019s biggest e-sports, Fortnite. Last March, real-world famous person and rapper Drake jumped on a stream with him for an old-world-meets-new-fame crossover event, and the feed quickly became the most viewed single streamer event in history \u2013 677,000 people concurrently watched two men play videogames.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elijah answers. \u201cHe\u2019s too sweaty.\u201d Essentially that means: Ninja is too good at videogames, to the point that it is no longer fun to watch. \u201cJust launch in, win the game, same same same,\u201d Elijah says. He cites a number of streamers he prefers to watch with completely made up names that I\u2019m too afraid to go back to ask him to clarify in case he laughs at me. But the point is: Twitch isn\u2019t just about being good at headshots. It\u2019s about being good to hang out with, too.\n\nPeople are dating after they met in the online chatroom\n\nBack next to Ball\u2019s ultra-computer and the chatroom watching with me seems to agree. His fans \u2013 self-named \u201cthe 42nd\u201d after his dual love of Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide\u2026 and the fact it sounds a bit like a regiment \u2013 variously use the room as a sounding board, a safe space, a place to tap into some human interaction on days when leaving the house seems too much, an idle chatter zone where someone is always there to listen and, in some cases, a place to make real friends or romantic connections.\n\n\u201cPeople are dating because they met in our community,\u201d Ball says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people who have struggles \u2013 \u2018Oh, my dad\u2019s drunk\u2019 \u2013 and we\u2019ve had people say, \u2018I\u2019ll pay for your plane ticket, come stay with me for a while and we\u2019ll figure it out.\u2019\u201d People can log on after a bad day and find someone to chat to about their mental health. They can also make stupid jokes or sit there in absolute silence.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realised I\u2019d been watching Twitch streams all my life. When I was a teenager, there was a quiet, soothing peace that came with slumping on a sofa in my friends\u2019 houses and watching them shoot heads apart on video games. There, in the half-attention and bathing glow of a screen after midnight, conversations can spool away into something deeper. It\u2019s possible to talk about sharp feelings and hard emotions better when the person you\u2019re talking to isn\u2019t making eye contact.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018We were lucky to get five days off for the wedding\u2019: Chris Ball and his wife Shannon. Photograph: Theo McInnes/The Observer\n\nLooking back on it, there was a two-year period following the release of Unreal Tournament 2003 where I don\u2019t think I saw one of my mate\u2019s faces even once: just the back of their head as they sprinted through lava-strewn maps to capture a digital flag while I lay behind them on a bed, talking about comics, films, overpoweringly raw teenage emotions, girls, worries about the impending doom of the future, exams, money, a lack of money, my dad, my mum, whether I\u2019d get into the right university, whether I\u2019d make friends, why the town we\u2019re in sucks.\n\nThere is something close to therapy in there, when someone isn\u2019t really paying attention to you but making the rough sounds as if they are: the occasional \u201cYup\u201d or \u201cAhuh\u201d or \u201cHow have I died again? How have I died again?\u201d punctuating indulgent teen-boy monologues from the middle of a beanbag placed on a messy floor. And that semi-attentive hypnotic state is useful in my life even now, getting hammered 4-0 on the sofa over Fifa while opening up about a break-up \u2013 and my theory is that Twitch taps into that grey, liminal area of half-chat. If you haven\u2019t got someone to listen to you burble on while you both play through the first Metal Gear Solid game, again \u2013 or, worse, you\u2019re having one of those days where the sheer idea of actual, by-your-side human company is A Bit Much for you \u2013 Twitch is there to fill the void. We worry about violence in videogames, for sure, but we underestimate the hypnotic, head-clearing effect of watching someone else perform it.\n\nThe mental health aspect of Twitch goes both ways, too: the strain for performers, having built up an audience and needing to sustain it, is very real. Ball pulls eight-hour days, six days a week and his schedule is rammed with streaming commitments (\u201cWe were lucky to get five days off for the wedding,\u201d his wife of a week, Shannon, tells me with a cheerful eye roll. \u201cHis day off is chosen by the algorithm. Currently it favours Fridays.\u201d) The issue came into focus earlier this year when YouTuber and streamer Desmond \u201cEtika\u201d Amofah was found dead a week after going missing in New York.\n\nMental health and technology writer Emily Reynolds recently highlighted how mental health-focused streamers were suffering burnout from becoming the de facto support network for their followers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rough,\u201d Ball admits. \u201cThe mental strain is pretty extreme, which is something that\u2019s being talked more about now.\u201d He has been known to fly to LA, make an appearance, turn around and, six hours later, fly back in time to stream again.\n\n\u201cMomentum is the key word in this industry,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of the top streamers on Twitch get there because they don\u2019t take time off.\u201d As jobs go, it\u2019s a lucrative, strange and highly pressured one.\n\nI let him turn back to the screen and I drive home, creaking through static gridlock, stopping off for a lengthy lunch. When I finally get home and flop on to my sofa, Ball is still online, streaming. And I watch him, hypnotically, rapt, as he wins three games in a row, knowing at any moment I can reach out as if touching him and whisper: \u201cSick kill.\u201d I am soothed for the evening. Tomorrow, he wakes up and goes again.", "description": "How did a site that live streams people playing video games in their bedrooms become as big as YouTube?
