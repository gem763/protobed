Abrams is the director and produced the film together with producers Kathleen Kennedy and Michelle Rejwan.\n\nBoth Luke (Mark Hamill) and Leia (Carrie Fisher) make an appearance in the rousing final trailer, while several scenes and characters hint at a finality and a sense of closure that might very well not mean happy endings for everyone involved.\n\n\"People keep telling me they know me,\" says Rey (Daisy Ridley) in the trailer. \"No-one does.\" Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) appears, as does an older Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).\n\nIn an already hauntingly emotional scene, the golden protocol droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) stares at his group of ragtag friends after he's asked what he's doing. \"Taking one last look, sir, at my friends\" as the rousing, iconic Star Wars score swells.\n\nOther cast members returning for the final instalment includes Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o and Kelly Marie Tran, and adding Richard E. Grant and Keri Russell.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker will have its release on 20 December 2019 and will end George Lucas' sprawling space opera saga as the 9th and final film in the Skywalker story.", "description": "Pack your bags!
