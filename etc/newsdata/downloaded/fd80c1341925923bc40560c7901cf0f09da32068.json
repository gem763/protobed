It's been reported that a number of slates are forming.\n\nInitially it was reported that current chair and legal guru Dali Mpofu would not return to his current position, but later officials in the party spoke anonymously about him possibly challenging Malema, sparking speculation that factions had emerged.\n\nSpeaking at site inspection on Monday, Mpofu said there were no factions in the party, The Citizen reported.\n\nNews24 understands from sources in the party that Malema favours KwaZulu-Natal provincial leader Marshall Dlamini for the position of secretary general, to replace Godrich Gardee.\n\nBattle for top positions\n\nThe party insiders also told News24 that Gardee was intent on fighting for his position. National spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has also been touted as a possible replacement for Gardee.\n\nTwo party leaders have also indicated that deputy secretary general Hlengiwe Hlophe will not be available for another term. One party official told News24 that little-known Poppy Mailola was on Malema\u2019s ticket to replace Hlophe.\n\nThis follows a City Press article in which it was reported that a video shows Mpumalanga chair Collen Sedibe telling branch members the conference at Nasrec was just a formality.\n\nSedibe further added that treasurer general Leigh-Ann Mathys had voluntarily declined to run again, City Press reported.\n\nMalema told journalists that nominations for party leaders would be taken from the floor to avoid factional battles.\n\nHe said all six of the party\u2019s leaders would make themselves available for positions. He said the party was ready to host the elective conference, adding that provinces had signed off their credentials and that branches had concluded their audits.\n\n\n\n'No position is reserved'\n\nHe said the implementation of 50-50 gender representation on all party structures would be discussed at the conference. Malema added that 90% of the conference delegates would be from branches and the remainder from regional, provincial and national leadership structures.\n\nThe EFF has also solicited new kids on the block Institute of Election Management Services in Africa (IEMSA) to run the elections. The company is headed by former IEC commissioner Terry Tselane.\n\nMalema said any nominee from the top six would be required to get support from 30% of the delegates in order to be placed on the ballot paper, while other members would be required to get the thumbs-up from 25% of voting delegates.\n\n\"We are contesting every position. No position is reserved. No one owns a position, all of us, those who want to stand will be subjected to nomination.\"\n\nMalema thanked party structures for their unwillingness to participate in factional battles via the media. He said all talks of contestation and leadership battles had to be coordinated within party structures. The conference is scheduled to take place between December 13 and 16.", "description": "All EFF members hoping to contest for national leadership positions will have to be nominated, without exception, says party leader Julius Malema.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9423/9b5da0ecc0164c9d9727cd6a267f7a78.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
