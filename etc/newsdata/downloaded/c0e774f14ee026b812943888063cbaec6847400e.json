I mean, they know who Sinatra is but they don\u2019t know who Sinatra is,\u201d he said.", "description": "Martin Scorsese has joked that making his latest film with Netflix allowed for a slower pace in the shooting schedule to suit a man in his seventies.", "authors": ["Sophie Barnes", "Jessica Carpani", "Daniel Hannan", "Ross Clark", "Robert Tombs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212813369-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqFmdtdovgxskirSSG45rbt-0JcK6kii4EZo4SCKDPAyk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
