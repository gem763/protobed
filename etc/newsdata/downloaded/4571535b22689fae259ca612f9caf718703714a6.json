He is also the son of the groom who was injured in Saturday's attack.\n\nSaturday's shooting happened as mourners started to arrive for Garcia's funeral, which was set to take place at the same church after the wedding ceremony.\n\nOfficials are now looking into the connections between the shootings.

Minor injuries occurred to the other guests who were in the struggle with the shooter.'\n\nHe added that it 'does not seem to be a random event'.\n\nBishop Stanley Choate was shot in the chest during the attack at New England Pentecostal Ministries during a wedding ceremony.

He was a Christian Batman hit by a Joker,' a family member said of Garcia.\n\nThe New York Police Department Counterterrorism Bureau had said it was 'closely monitoring the shooting incident at the New England Pentecostal church in Pelham, NH.'\n\nThe church website describes itself as 'committed to touching lives dramatically and bringing aid and deliverance to all people regardless of race, creed or color throughout all generations.\n\n'Our church welcomes people from all parts of New England and the Northeast area.'\n\nDale Holloway, 37, who has been arrested for first-degree assault and counts of purposely and knowingly causing bodily injury by means of a deadly weapon\n\nPolice were called to the church in Pelham around 10am, where they found the gunman being pinned down by some of the 40 wedding guests\n\nBishop Choate and his wife Ruth had been leading the church since 1987.\n\nOn Facebook, Nevia Choate wrote a post identifying herself as the bishop's niece.\n\nShe wrote: 'A coward walked into my family's church today at NEP New England Pentecostal Church and shot my uncle Bishop Stanley Choate.
