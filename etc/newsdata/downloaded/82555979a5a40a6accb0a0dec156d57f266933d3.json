It may also compel him to hand over any correspondence he had with Arcuri. The committee makes no distinction between private and personal correspondence.\n\nThis could prove potentially embarrassing for Johnson, who has declined to answer allegations about whether he had an affair with the businesswoman. However, any correspondence, if indeed there was any, may have been deleted long ago.\n\nPowers to summons Johnson are conferred under section 61 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, which can compel anyone who has been mayor within the last eight years to \u201c(a) attend proceedings of the assembly for the purpose of giving evidence; or (b) produce to the assembly documents in their possession or under their control\u201d.\n\nFailure to comply with a summons can be met with a prison sentence of up to three months or an unlimited fine. Johnson has pledged to \u201ccooperate with my old friends on the assembly\u201d. However, last month he broke specific promises to appear before the Commons liaison committee.\n\nA summons notice has been used to powerful effect by the assembly in the past. Key emails obtained by the assembly\u2019s transport committee showed that the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, was kept in the dark over problems with Crossrail by the project\u2019s sponsors, the Department for Transport and Transport for London.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest London mayor Sadiq Khan.

The summons compelling him to appear was the first the assembly had used on a former London mayor. It also summoned Johnson and several others to hand over key documents issued during his time in office.\n\nThe oversight committee will meet on Wednesday to discuss what further steps it will take following allegations that Johnson failed to declare his friendship with Arcuri while he was mayor and that she benefited from the relationship.\n\nIt is alleged that Johnson helped secure Arcuri places on prestigious overseas trade trips. He also appeared at technology conferences she organised, helping boost their profile. Johnson has denied any impropriety.\n\nArcuri vehemently denies a sexual relationship with the prime minister. She insists that he visited her flat in Shoreditch, London, to learn about technology.\n\nIn a rambling interview with the Mirror last week, Arcuri described suggestions that she had been Johnson\u2019s lover as \u201ccomplete bulls**t\u201d, adding: \u201cIf I was banging the dude and there was some kind of, like trail or sex tape, but there\u2019s nothing. There is a human side of my very complex relationship. This is not a Monica Lewinsky.\u201d\n\nAny action the oversight committee takes is likely to be influenced by separate developments at the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The office has been asked to consider whether Johnson, who as mayor was responsible for London\u2019s policing, should be investigated for misconduct in public office.\n\nIf the office were to investigate, the GLA oversight committee may postpone taking any further action.\n\nSeparately, Khan has asked a senior lawyer to review a decision by the mayor\u2019s promotional agency, London & Partners, to award an Arcuri firm a \u00a310,000 grant while Johnson was at city hall. A further \u00a3100,000 grant given to an Arcuri business, Hacker House, is also being investigated by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nThe GLA summons system is unusual in that it has teeth. Parliamentary committees can summon individuals to appear before them but no punitive action can be taken against those who refuse to do so. Johnson\u2019s adviser, Dominic Cummings, famously declined to appear before the DCMS committee without any comeback.", "description": "London assembly committee may also compel PM to appear before it to answer questions about relationship with entrepreneur", "authors": ["Jamie Doward"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a4dc63fa1606d267cd22da4f15de72815ff3d58/478_62_783_470/master/783.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=487d4501ddab69b939c415aea77a2b20", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
