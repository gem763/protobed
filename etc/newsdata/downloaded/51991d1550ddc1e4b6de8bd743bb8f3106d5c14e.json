According to an intelligence-community whistleblower, Trump was reluctant to permit high-level engagement with Zelensky before the Ukrainian president acceded to requests for a new investigation into Biden\u2019s youngest son, Hunter, who formerly sat on the board of a large Ukrainian energy company.\n\nIn the weeks between a Ukrainian election that winnowed the presidential field to two and the subsequent runoff that saw Zelensky unseat the incumbent president, his campaign hired Signal Group Consulting to advance its interests in Washington, FARA filings show.\n\nSignal Group was paid $60,000 plus expenses for its work, which lasted only about six weeks, from early April to May 21, the day after Zelensky was inaugurated. The firm initially declined to go into much detail about its meetings on Zelensky\u2019s behalf, referring The Daily Beast\u2019s questions last week to a DOJ filing that listed the offices and agencies the firm contacted on Zelensky\u2019s behalf, but not the individual staffers with which the firm worked.\n\nBut the Signal Group recently amended that filing to provide significantly more detail. Among its contacts in the Trump administration, the firm told DOJ, were Alexander Vindman, who oversees Eurasia for the White House National Security Council and joined Energy Secretary Rick Perry on a small Trump administration delegation to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May.\n\nThat delegation merited a mention in an intelligence-community whistleblower complaint released last week alleging that Trump and Giuliani pressured Ukrainian leaders, including Zelensky, to investigate potential Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden\u2019s son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine. The scandal is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry against the president.\n\nThe Signal Group\u2019s lobbying campaign took place right as Trump and Giuliani began to turn up the public pressure on Ukraine to look into the Biden situation. Those efforts culminated in a phone call in late July between Trump and Zelensky, during which the former pledged the assistance of Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr in digging into corruption allegations against the former vice president and his family.\n\nThe public has not yet seen a transcript of Trump\u2019s first call with Zelensky, which took place on April 21, making it difficult to know whether he exerted comparable pressure on the new Ukrainian leader at the time. But Giuliani was already deeply involved in attempting to unearth alleged Biden malfeasance in the country.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication that the Signal Group\u2019s work was related to that campaign. But for a time, the firm made a number of high-level connections between Zelensky\u2019s team and key members of the Trump administration as well as several members of Congress, media organizations, and think tanks.\n\nAccording to its DOJ filing, Signal Group representatives also met John Erath, the NSC\u2019s deputy director for European affairs, and State Department officials including Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent and Brad Freden, the director of the office of Eastern European affairs.\n\nIn an email last week, John Procter, Signal Group\u2019s managing director, declined to go into specifics about its work. \u201cSignal Group\u2019s work for Mr. Zelensky and the Servant of the People party through Marcus Cohen concluded on May 21 and is detailed in our FARA filings with the Department of Justice,\u201d Procter said. \u201cI would direct you to the details of those documents for your reporting. The firm does not have anything additional to add.\u201d\n\nAccording to its DOJ filing, the Signal Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of the prominent Washington law and lobbying firm Wiley Rein. That firm previously represented Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister who also ran for president this year.\n\nIts Zelensky contract was arranged through an intermediary named Marcus Cohen, whom The Daily Beast was not able to reach. Cohen previously told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that he arranged for the lobbying contract independently of Zelensky, who has denied any knowledge of a U.S. lobbying campaign on his behalf.\n\nBut Cohen signed the Signal Group\u2019s DOJ filings \u201con behalf of the Zelensky Campaign,\u201d and according to RFE/RL, both Cohen and Ivan Bakanov, Zelensky\u2019s campaign chairman, attended meetings with Signal Group lobbying targets during its springtime influence campaign.\n\nBoth men were spotted among a dozen attendees at one particularly conspicuous meeting in mid-April: They and a group of unidentified compatriots went out for dinner at the steakhouse in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel just down the street from the White House.", "description": "Those contacts coincided with an effort by President Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to press for scrutiny of Joe Biden\u2019s son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1782,w_3169,x_0,y_132/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569858203/GettyImages-1171051478_n0pp8h", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
