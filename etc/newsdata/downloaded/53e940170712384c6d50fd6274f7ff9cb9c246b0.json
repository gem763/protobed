Vavae Malepeai rushed for two touchdowns and Stephen Carr added a 25-yard TD run in a 492-yard performance by coordinator Graham Harrell\u2019s Air Raid offense.\n\nSlovis, whose high school position coach was Kurt Warner, won his duel with fellow first-time starter Davis Mills, who went 22 of 36 for 237 yards for Stanford. The USC student section chanted Slovis\u2018 name during the victory, and his teammates praised it afterward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised at all,\u201d center Brett Neilon said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched the kid, and he\u2019s a special talent. Everyone in the locker room believed in him. He\u2019s really poised, and he rallied us all together.\u201d\n\nCameron Scarlett rushed for 82 yards and a touchdown, but the Cardinal were outscored 42-3 in the final 43 minutes.\n\nDespite being forced by injury to switch starting quarterbacks already, the Trojans are off to a dynamic start under embattled coach Clay Helton coming out of the school\u2019s first losing season since 2000.\n\n\u201cGive a lot of credit to USC,\u201d Stanford coach David Shaw said. \u201cI thought we had them on the ropes in the first half. They showed great resilience, came back and made some plays and got back in the game. And I\u2019ll say this: Clay Helton has heard a lot of (stuff) from a lot of people for a lot of things. I think he\u2019s one heck of a football coach. I think he\u2019s got a really good football team. I thought they were extremely prepared.\u201d\n\nBoth quarterbacks got into the spotlight because of injuries to the schools\u2019 chosen starters last week. USC\u2019s J.T. Daniels is out for the season after injuring his knee while being tackled on a blitz, while Stanford\u2019s K.J. Costello was ruled out for only this week after a head hit.\n\nBoth passers got off to strong starts at the Coliseum, but only Slovis sustained it.\n\nMills completed his first four passes while the Cardinal opened with two long touchdown drives, capping the opener with his first career TD pass to Connor Wedington. Stanford jumped to a 17-3 lead with a field goal after USC\u2019s Velus Jones fumbled a kickoff return, but the Trojans soon got rolling.\n\nSlovis largely handed off last week after he replaced Daniels, but Harrell said he wouldn\u2019t simplify his game plan with Slovis as his starter. Harrell proved it immediately against Stanford, and Slovis met the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe understood his talent, and we understood the type of players our quarterbacks are,\u201d Helton said. \u201cI said, \u2018Graham, let\u2019s cut it loose, and let\u2019s go have fun. Let\u2019s play fast and play aggressive. Even though he\u2019s young, we named him the No. 2 for a reason.\u2019 That\u2019s not hard for Graham, because he\u2019s always looking to cut it loose.\u201d\n\nSlovis got his first TD pass early in the second quarter, hitting St. Brown for a 39-yard score. After Carr made a 25-yard TD run, Slovis capped a quick 70-yard drive with a second TD pass to St. Brown 31 seconds before halftime, putting USC ahead for the first time.\n\n\u201cYou never, ever want to look back and just realize it was just completely on your execution, that it was really in your control, but it was,\u201d Stanford linebacker Casey Toohill said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a good game.\u201d\n\nSlovis completed 12 consecutive passes in the second and third quarters, while Mills missed a handful of open receivers at important moments.\n\n\u201cI think this guy is going to be really, really good,\u201d Shaw said of Mills. \u201cBut (he) missed some opportunities, and some opportunities we didn\u2019t give him.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans went up 31-20 when Malepeai punched it in after Slovis hit Michael Pittman Jr. with a pinpoint 30-yard pass. After USC\u2019s Greg Johnson grabbed the game\u2019s first interception, Slovis marched the Trojans on another resilient TD drive capped by Malepeai again.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nStanford: Mills should give way to Costello next week, but the Cardinal should be much more worried about a defense that struggled mightily with USC\u2019s Air Raid offense. Stanford\u2019s defense held USC to three points last year, but spent the entire rematch struggling to slow down any part of Harrell\u2019s scheme.\n\nUSC: Slovis answered every question about the faith invested in him by Helton and Harrell when they named him their backup quarterback. Slovis will face stiff defensive challenges weekly, but the Trojans move forward knowing they\u2019ve got a budding star behind center.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nStanford: At UCF on Saturday.\n\nUSC: At BYU on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Not many freshmen get to climb the stepladder, hold up the sword and lead the Southern California band in a postgame victory party at the Coliseum.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/stanford_usc_football_58625_c0-123-3084-1921_s1770x1032.jpg?b35d68c56150f5cced07288a04f4d4391f4ae874", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
