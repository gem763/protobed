Metals are then purified and solidified before being turned into new products.\n\nThe cost of designing and producing the commemorative coins will be met by the Royal Mint out of its own revenues at no cost to the taxpayer.\n\nChancellor Sajid Javid had asked officials to look at whether it would be possible to produce the coins in volume ready for the UK's scheduled EU leaving date of October 31.\n\nFormer chancellor Philip Hammond had planned a limited edition of around 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for \u00a310 each.\n\nMr Javid revised the proposal for the coins to be produced for mass circulation. This was portrayed as a statement of intent that the Treasury was fully behind Brexit.", "description": "The humiliating step comes as the Treasury refuses to say how many of the October 31 coins it produced - or how much they cost to mint", "authors": ["Megan Baynes", "Dan Bloom", "Image", "Hm Treasury", "Peter Summers"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14184122.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_Brexit-50p-coin-hasnt-actually-been-minted-in-perfect-metaphor-for-Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
