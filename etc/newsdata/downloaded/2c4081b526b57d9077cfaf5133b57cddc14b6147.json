Japanese rugby is in a good place now. I am going to really celebrate the achievements of this team. There's been a lot of work and it's been relentless.\"\n\nHis achievements with Japan have even led to him being linked to a job with the All Blacks after current coach Steve Hansen leaves.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Japan's Rugby Football Union will seek to keep Jamie Joseph as coach after he took the Brave Blossoms to a historic World Cup quarter-final at home, its president said Thursday. \"The selection committee has decided to ask him to serve as the head coach in light of results of the\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/e3/4c/007a9e96614b8c74a01999fd61ac25c35219/e34c007a9e96614b8c74a01999fd61ac25c35219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
