She travels from Buckingham Palace in a horse-drawn state carriage, escorted by the Household Cavalry.\n\nBefore she arrived, the priceless Imperial State Crown and other regalia used in the ceremony was brought to Parliament in a separate heavily-guarded carriage.\n\nThe crown includes 2,868 diamonds, including the Second Star of Africa diamond, and many other gems. The crown was made for King George VI's coronation in 1937, based on a crown designed for Queen Victoria in 1838.\n\nThe heavy crown is a powerful symbol of the queen's authority, but Elizabeth chose not to wear it. It was instead placed on a cushion nearby.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
