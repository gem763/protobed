More specifically, I prided myself on \u2018not being like other girls\u2019. As a result, to nobody\u2019s surprise, I didn\u2019t have many friends who were women. The ones I did have, we always felt like we were competing with each other \u2014 for attention, for acclaim, for boys.\n\nI blamed it on being \u2018too abrasive\u2019 or \u2018too different\u2019 to be able to develop those kinds of friendships and relationships. But really it just took me a while to realise how valuable and important it is for women to have other women in our lives. Not only that, but also to realise that we need to be building each other up, not fighting and competing.\n\nI know a lot of women resonate with this, because it\u2019s not just a question of my lived experience. This is something that we\u2019re all conditioned to feel, through movies and pop culture, and we\u2019re pitted against each other each step of the way.\n\nBut why is that? There are fewer opportunities for women in male-dominated industries. There\u2019s a lot more stigma over being the best looking, the smartest in the room, the least hairy-legged human. There\u2019s an immense pressure to be thinner, smoother, smarter, more \u2018cool\u2019 than other women.\n\nAnd I cannot stress enough how important it is for transgender women and gender-diverse people that they have support networks including women to help them navigate a society that isn\u2019t as inclusive as it should be.\n\nREAD MORE How \u2018Booksmart\u2019 Is Ditching Those Ridiculous Tropes About Female Friendships\n\nFor me, things turned around when I got older and started to surround myself with people who actually supported me. I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky to have had truly life-changing female mentors and friends, who encouraged me to look beyond the societal standards.\n\nThere are so many supporting factors for why I believe women need other women in our lives, but if I had to boil it down, there are three core reasons:\n\n1. We have a world of shared experience\n\nWe\u2019re all dealing with similar bull that every woman faces each day of her life. From being overlooked for promotions to being catcalled on the street, we\u2019ve all copped it. We\u2019re all dealing with different kinds of body confidence issues and dating dramas. We sympathise, because we have that personal understanding of how it can be.\n\nI asked the women in my life what they thought, and my friend Cat said:\n\n\u201cI think we need women around to have a relatable support network. It opens up communication when we have someone we can relate to especially if the issues are female identifying based, relationships. work problems, interests and even hobbies. It\u2019s nice to know that other women go through the same thought processes and experiences and I have people to reach out to for help or to have a chat.\u201d\n\n2. We\u2019re all working towards the same cause\n\nUltimately, we all want equality. We have a vested interest in building each other up because it will only benefit all women in the long run. The more female CEOs, the more recognition that women can thrive in leadership instead of being \u2018bossy\u2019. The more women earning millions, the harder it is to justify a pay gap.\n\nMy friend Liv agreed, saying:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discrimination against women in the world, and our voices are often softer than that of men. For us to fight against it, we need to band together to be louder than the voices of those who oppress us, and be part of the change.\u201d\n\n3. Sometimes you just need your gals around you\n\nHonestly one of the biggest things for me is how incredibly supportive women can be with each other. My close female friends are there for me no matter what I\u2019m going through \u2014 from breakups to clothing disasters, they are there and available every step of the way because they know I am for them too.\n\nAccording to my pal Emma:\n\n\u201cFemale friendships are some of the most powerful bonds in my opinion. We are fierce in our friendships. We support, console, laugh, cry, guide, lift up, ground. Also, in an age where dating is SO hard to navigate, we need our female friendships to keep us in check.\u201d\n\nNow that I\u2019m in my mid-20s, things have changed. I am fortunate enough to have a support network filled with talented and supportive women. I\u2019m program manager for a mentorship program that actively seeks to give women a seat at the table in gaming/tech. My best friend and I can talk about literally anything with no boundaries.\n\nAnd if someone refers to me as \u2018not like other girls\u2019, I don\u2019t feel one shred of gratitude or pride. Because I know that\u2019s not a compliment. It\u2019s never a compliment if you have to drag everyone else down in order to bring someone up.\n\nSo gather your gals. Reach out to some if you don\u2019t have any close to you right now. Your mates, your mentors, your colleagues, your sisters, your fave barista. Develop those friendships, whether by meeting for coffee or even by holding a big Girls\u2019 Night In.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun, simple way for women to raise funds and awareness for women\u2019s cancer research, prevention and support services. Plus it\u2019s a great excuse to gather the women in your life around you and have a damn good time.\n\nAll you\u2019ve gotta do is head online and register to set up your fundraising page and receive a host kit. Whether you wanna hold a dinner party, a big ol\u2019 brunch or even a high tea, it doesn\u2019t matter as long as you\u2019re with the women you value most.\n\nBecause we are like all the other girls, and that\u2019s absolutely fine.", "description": "Gather women around.
