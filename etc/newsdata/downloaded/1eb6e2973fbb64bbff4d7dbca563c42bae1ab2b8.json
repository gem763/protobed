That\u2019s because it\u2019s taking the wellness world by storm.\n\nToday you can get lattes, chocolates, oils, and lotions infused with the stuff, and you\u2019ll find users online regularly championing the benefits of this hemp extract.\n\nWhile already popular in the States and Europe, it\u2019s now slowly but surely creeping into the Japanese market. But like anything that comes from the hemp plant, there\u2019s still a bit of ambiguity about what CBD is, what it does, and its legal status here, in a nation with very strict anti-marijuana laws. So in an effort to clear up any ambiguities, we\u2019ve put together a crash course on CBD with a specific focus on Japan.\n\nWhat is CBD?\n\nWithout getting too scientific, CBD (cannabidiol) is a compound found in the flower of the cannabis plant. No matter your attitude to the plant, it\u2019s hard to deny that this famous green flower has a bevy of medicinal properties. These properties have been utilized by cultures across the globe since the discovery of its powers.\n\nCBD is one of the hundreds of phytocannabinoids, or often simply referred to as a cannabinoid, produced by the plant. A cannabinoid is a compound that reacts to the human body\u2019s endocannabinoid system (ECS), a cell-signaling system that experts are still trying to learn more about. In general, the ECS plays a significant role in the regulation of many of our crucial human functions, including sleep, stress, appetite, mood, memory, and even reproduction and fertility.\n\nWhile a cannabinoid can be manufactured artificially, CBD is naturally occurring, and it\u2019s a safe, non-addictive substance. It\u2019s closely linked to THC, the compound in marijuana that makes you high. Both compounds have been found to have relaxation and mood-elevating effects (from higher levels of dopamine), though those effects can vary from person to person. Although similar to THC, an article by the Healthline states that studies confirm CBD reacts to the human body in a very different way to THC, and will never leave a consumer feeling \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018stoned.\u2019\n\nWhat is it used for?\n\nCBD\u2019s effects and uses greatly depend on the consumer. But many people use it for pain relief, relaxation, to reduce stress and anxiety, battle Alzheimer\u2019s, improve sleep, as an alternative to antiseizure medications, and a multitude of other issues.\n\nPriyanka Yoshikawa, an entrepreneur, charity ambassador, model, and Miss World Japan 2016/17 is a huge advocate for CBD\u2019s positive effects. She\u2019s about to release Mukoomi, her own brand of CBD oils and CBD-infused skincare products targeted to the Japanese market.\n\n\u201cWhile I was modeling, I experienced an immense amount of work pressure,\u201d Priyanka explains. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in that aspect of my career, and it started to affect my health physically and emotionally. Every time you go to an audition, you\u2019re being judged and critiqued, you never know whether you\u2019re good enough. Those everyday work anxieties start to build up. I started to struggle with sleeping, and my skin really broke out.\u201d\n\nWhen she went to the US a little over a year ago, Priyanka discovered the growing popularity of CBD and how it could provide her with some clarity and relief. \u201cBefore the US, I didn\u2019t know about CBD. When I was there; however, it was everywhere. I tried it and haven\u2019t looked back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still relatively unknown in Japan\u2014perhaps thanks to the stigma around marijuana\u2014but it has a lot of potential here. \u201cI love Japan,\u201d says Priyanka, \u201cbut living here can be stressful, Japanese workers face a lot of pressure, stress levels are high. People in Japan drink alcohol and smoke a lot compared to other countries too. I think if there were more accessible alternative options for stress relief, the country would only benefit.\u201d\n\nIs CBD legal in Japan?\n\nWhen explaining to uninitiated folk about CBD and its origins, the cannabis plant, the two main questions that often first come up are:\n\nDoes it make you high? No\u2014it doesn\u2019t contain THC, the element of the plant that makes you high. That being said, outside of Japan, there are countries where it is possible to purchase THC-infused CBD oil. But not here, and to avoid jail, don\u2019t bother even trying to bring it in. Is it legal? The answer is yes! Because it contains no psychoactive elements like THC, it\u2019s treated similarly to a health supplement here.\n\nHow do you take CBD?\n\nCBD comes in so many different forms. There are lotions and skincare products, shampoos, chocolates, vapes, gummies\u2014basically, if there\u2019s a way to get CBD into your body, someone has created and produced it, marketed it, and is already selling it. The foundational way, however, to consume CBD is as an oil or capsule.\n\nPriyanka recommends those who are new to the word of CBD to go for the oil. \u201cYou can mix it into water, food, or tea,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut of course it\u2019s oil, so it doesn\u2019t always dilute so well. Another more direct alternative is to drop it straight under your tongue, using a tincture and leave it there for around a minute before swallowing.\u201d If you choose to take it as a capsule, you would take one each morning with your breakfast, just like you would a vitamin capsule.\n\nWhat to look for when buying CBD?\n\nThe first thing to look for is the type of CBD oil. When shopping around, you\u2019ll notice there are three main variations: CBD isolate, full-spectrum CBD, and broad-spectrum CBD.\n\nCBD isolate: THC-free. Isolated from the other cannabinoids and compounds of the plant, making it 99 percent pure. If you\u2019re just starting out, this is the way to go.\n\nTHC-free. Isolated from the other cannabinoids and compounds of the plant, making it 99 percent pure. If you\u2019re just starting out, this is the way to go. Full-spectrum CBD: contains THC, so it\u2019s illegal in Japan.\n\nBroad-spectrum CBD: THC-free. Sits somewhere between full-spectrum CBD and CBD isolate; while the THC has been removed, some compounds found within the plant stay in the oil, unlike CBD isolate.\n\nThe next thing to look for is how much is in the bottle. Good, trustworthy CBD will make clear how many milligrams (mg) of CBD are in the bottle. Being smart about how much you consume takes a little calculating, but it\u2019s worth the effort. Use this website to calculate how much you\u2019ll need according to your body weight.\n\nThere are CBD stores in Tokyo currently, like Healthy Tokyo which has outlets in Minami-Aoyama and Haneda airport. Cosme Kitchen is another popular beauty store in Japan that carries CBD oil in Japan.\n\nSo what\u2019s next?\n\nWith this overload of information, it can be a little overwhelming. So to figure out whether you\u2019d benefit from CBD, or what type to buy, it\u2019s always best to do a little homework yourself, read the reviews, and shop around.\n\nHave you used CBD oil before?
