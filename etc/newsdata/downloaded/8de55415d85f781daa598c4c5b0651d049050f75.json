The comet is believed to have arrived here from another planetary system elsewhere in our galaxy. (Photo: NASA, ESA, D. Jewitt (UCLA))\n\nAstronomers on Wednesday released the best photo yet of 2I/Borisov, the comet from outer space.\n\nThe comet, which appears blue in the image, is zooming by at a blistering 110,000 mph, and the Hubble Space Telescope caught some shots over the weekend from a distance of 260 million miles.\n\nThe comet was discovered Aug. 30 by Gennady Borisov at an observatory in Nauchnij, Crimea.\n\n2I/Borisov is inbound toward the sun, but it will remain farther than the orbit of Mars and will approach no closer to Earth than about 190 million miles in early December, NASA said.\n\nLooks familiar: Newly discovered comet is confirmed as an interstellar visitor \u2013 with a surprisingly familiar look\n\n\"No one knows where it came from. No one knows how long it has been drifting through the empty, cold abyss of interstellar space,\" NASA said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nIt\u2019s the second known interstellar visitor to swoop through our backyard. Two years ago, a cigar-shaped rock, 'Oumuamua, paid a brief visit to our solar system.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/16/hubble-telescope-spots-interstellar-comet-borisov/4000572002/", "description": "Astronomers released the best photo yet of 2I/Borisov, the comet from outer space.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Published P.M.
