DARPA has long been interested in ways military and first responders are able to maneuver inside tunnels, caves and underground facilities.\n\nThe stakes and mind-boggling complexities for rescuers was made clear last year in Thailand, when 12 children and their soccer coach were trapped in a cave, prompting an enormous and successful rescue.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. military has bet that future conflict will unfold in megacities and their seemingly endless and claustrophobic knot of tunnels, sewers, subway lines and facilities where enemy troops can move and attack without fearing airstrikes or artillery.\n\nA secretive space drone just broke its own orbit record, and almost no one knows what it\u2019s doing\n\nThe Army has poured half a billion dollars to overhaul how infantry can move where the enemy expects them to move, communicate in an environment where radio transmissions may prove futile, and orient themselves in a place where a GPS \u2014 another DARPA project \u2014 would be useless. In that environment, night vision goggles that rely on ambient light may be useless, air can be toxic and enemy traps could lurk anywhere.\n\nIt\u2019s not a new concept. Viet Cong-dug tunnels helped militants vanish and outflank U.S. troops, Navy SEALs flushed out militants in Afghanistan caves early in that war, and the Islamic State has burrowed into safety.\n\nBut now, China, Russia and North Korea could use a similar network to house command and control, mobilize troops and even launch planes from underground runways, Military Times reported.\n\nEnter DARPA\u2019s Subterranean Challenge, dubbed \u201cSubT Challenge.\u201d\n\nDARPA finally revealed in a tweet a day later as the source behind its request: a competition that will help them develop \u201cnovel approaches to rapidly map, navigate, and search underground environments during time-sensitive combat operations or disaster response scenarios.\u201d\n\nThe competition will hand out about $5 million in prize money to teams competing in various circuits and recently, eleven teams from eight countries completed a circuit in a Pittsburgh mine.\n\n\u201cWith them, they brought 20 unmanned aerial vehicles, 64 ground robots and one autonomous blimp robot named Duckiefloat,\u201d DARPA said.\n\nThe agency had already posted the request on its website on Aug. 20 in search of an environment suitable for the next challenge in February, Jared Adams, a DARPA spokesman, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe tweets \u201cwere a reminder of the upcoming deadline to respond,\u201d Adams said, referring to posting on a clunky government website that few outside Washington have likely heard of before.\n\nAdams told BuzzFeed News in a statement that it received few responses and turned to social media for help, creating the temporary freakout.\n\nWho can blame the inventors of the Internet for that?\n\nRead more:\n\nFatal vehicle accidents in the military expose dangers troops face far from the battlefield\n\nWatch a Coast Guardsman leap onto a moving \u2018narco-submarine\u2019 full of cocaine", "description": "\u201cSpaces that are currently closed off from pedestrians or can be temporarily used for testing are of interest,\u201d the military's research arm said ominously on Twitter.
