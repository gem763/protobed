Since the last midterm election, 42 percent of the new voters who have registered are nonwhite. For the same period in the last presidential cycle, the percentage was 38.\n\nAnd these voters \u2014 who typically vote disproportionately Democratic \u2014 tend to be the ones Trump is incentivizing to turn out against him next year.\n\nFlorida Playbook Our must-read briefing on what\u2019s hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

And so far, if your name is not Barack Obama, no Democrat has been able to capitalize on it. And the top Democrats in the primary are not firing up the Obama coalition that we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nThe biggest turnout target for Democrats are not immigrants from another country. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, 72,000 of whom have moved to Florida since 2017, when Hurricane Maria devastated the island, and they are immediately eligible to vote. Trump\u2019s handling of the disaster \u2014 and his spreading of unfounded conspiracy theories casting doubt on the death toll \u2014 has left him with a near-rock-bottom 21 percent favorability rating among Boricua voters.\n\nTrump\u2019s support among Haitian Americans has also taken a beating since he last campaigned in their community in 2016 and pledged: \u201cI want to be your greatest champion.\u201d Instead, Trump has threatened to remove the Temporary Protected Status, commonly called TPS, of 56,000 Haitian immigrants who came to the U.S. after a 2011 earthquake rocked the country. And he allegedly called Haiti a \u201c shithole\u201d behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cBad words are bad words. Nobody likes to hear their home country called a shithole,\u201d said Hans Mardy, a Republican Haitian-American activist. \u201cAs a Republican, I would like to see a better collaboration with our government.\u201d\n\nAbout 115,000 Florida voters were born in Haiti, according to data compiled by University of Florida political science professor Dan Smith, and they turn out at higher rates than the statewide average. Smith estimated that about 8 in 10 Haitian-Americans vote Democrat.\n\n\u201cHaiti-born Florida voters turned out in 2018, higher than any other naturalized citizens. Probably didn\u2019t really care for their country being called a shithole,\u201d Smith deadpanned.\n\nTrump also pledged to stand with Venezuelans and initially earned high marks in the state for cracking down on the dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. But there\u2019s a growing sense in the community of being let down, especially as Venezuelan-Americans implore Trump to approve TPS for as many as 200,000 of their countrymen, many of whom are fleeing to Florida. The president has so far refused.\n\n\u201cThe more time that passes with nothing happening, the more Venezuelan-Americans are becoming disenchanted between what Trump is saying but not actually doing,\u201d said Helena Poleo, a Venezuelan-American Democratic consultant.\n\n\u201cHaiti-born Florida voters turned out in 2018, higher than any other naturalized citizens. Probably didn\u2019t really care for their country being called a shithole.\" - University of Florida political science professor Dan Smith\n\nAbout 44,000 Florida voters were born in Venezuela, about 7 in 10 Venezuelans vote Democrat and their turnout tends to be slightly higher than the statewide average, according to Smith\u2019s data.\n\nWhile Venezuelans are fleeing an economic and political disaster, Bahamians came ashore after Hurricane Dorian last month devastated some of the islands. Trump, who has been concerned that Haitians in the Bahamas have been slipping into the U.S. with Bahamian nationals has also resisted granting the relief.\n\nThe number of Bahamians in Florida isn\u2019t substantial: only about 5,900 Florida voters were born in the Bahamas. But they are joined by other small Caribbean and Latin American groups with aggrieved by administration policies. Aside from 5,200 El Salvadoran-born Florida voters, there are Nicaraguans and Hondurans also worried they\u2019ll lose TPS protections under Trump. According to Smith\u2019s data, the state also has a growing Mexican-American population of about 36,000 voters born in Mexico and there are at least 91,000 Florida voters born in Jamaica, many of whom find common cause in Florida with Bahamians, English-speaking fellow Caribbean islanders.\n\nTrump has heard the doubts and doomsaying about Florida before and won the state anyway, defying pundits and political consultants who wrongly thought his positions on immigration would kill his candidacy with Hispanics. And in 2018, his handpicked candidate for governor, Ron DeSantis, also defied the conventional wisdom and won the state by less than half a point. It was just days after Trump threatened to unilaterally end constitutionally protected birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants.\n\nDemocratic hopes that many of these groups they would vote in force fizzled in 2018. Of the roughly 219,000 Florida voters born in Puerto Rico, only 48 percent turned out last year in an election when overall turnout was 63 percent, according to Smith\u2019s data. The state has more than 1 million Puerto Rican residents overall.\n\nIn last year\u2019s midterm elections, the state was a red wall of resistance to the blue wave that swept most of the nation thanks to the sky-high high turnout rates of older white voters \u2014 who tend to disproportionately vote Republican. Low Hispanic turnout was also a key. Overall, the white vote is increasingly becoming more Republican, although not to the same degree that non-white voters break for Democrats.\n\nOf Florida\u2019s 13.5 million active registered voters, about 63 percent are white, 3 points lower than at this point in the 2016 cycle .\n\nOlder white voters constitute the core of Trump\u2019s base here, sprinkled throughout the state and notably clustered in the Central Florida retirement community called The Villages, where Trump stopped Thursday .\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s visit to The Villages could not better illustrate his strategy in Florida, which is to double down on older white voters,\u201d said Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor against DeSantis. Today, Gillum and a coalition of Democratic groups are funneling money into voter registration efforts, which are slowly ramping up.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump did in 2016 in the state \u2014 which shocked so many of us because we didn\u2019t think he could do this \u2013 was run a hyper-white campaign,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cBut Florida is changing. And it will be a tipping point if we can just get people out to vote.\u201d\n\nJust as Trump\u2019s Thursday visit to The Villages was emblematic of his campaign, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi showed her party\u2019s hand in Florida on Thursday when she made two South Florida stops with Venezuelan- and Haitian-Americans.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign is still trying to make inroads with Hispanic voters. Aside from Cuban-Americans, who vote heavily GOP, an increasing share of Hispanic immigrants are joining evangelical megachurches and are seen as reachable for Republicans because of the issues of abortion and school choice.\n\nTrump\u2019s top surrogate in the state, Panhandle-area Congressman Matt Gaetz, said the GOP dominance in the state has made it increasingly attractive to retirees fleeing bad weather and high taxes up north, and that their reliability in the voting booth will make up for the loss of registration share to the growing Democratic coalition.\n\n\u201cFlorida is getting redder by the day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 800+ people per day who move here want to keep the good times rollin.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs long as nonwhite turnout remains low and the domestic in-migration of wealthy whites continues apace, Republicans will have the edge. But if there was ever an election season when demographics could overtake the GOP, it\u2019s 2020, according to Andrea Cristina Mercado, executive director of New Florida Majority, one of the top progressive groups in the state registering poor and non-white voters.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have taken these communities for granted for too long. They thought that demographics is destiny,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to work for it. And that's what we're doing.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "University Of Florida Political Science Professor Dan Smith"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1d/75/79e9487a465b9996a5d9bad7bceb/20191006-donald-trump-florida-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
