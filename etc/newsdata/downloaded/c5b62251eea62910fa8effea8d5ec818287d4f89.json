Even though the final season of HBO\u2019s blockbuster series was put on blast by social media, Emmy voters propelled it to a record 32 nominations. The fact that Game of Thrones already took home 10 of those statues at the Creative Arts Emmys this past weekend heralds a big night for Westeros when the 71st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards air Sunday, Sept. 22 on Fox. Still, there could be a few usurpers out there eager to claim the Emmy Throne for themselves. Here are Yahoo Entertainment\u2019s predictions for the winners in the major Emmy categories, along with a peek at what oddsmakers are saying.\n\nOutstanding Drama Series\n\nView photos The Night King (Vladimir Furdik) walks in Game of Thrones. (Photo: HBO) More\n\nNominees:\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nBodyguard\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nKilling Eve\n\nOzark\n\nPose\n\nSuccession\n\nThis Is Us\n\nAs dominant as Game of Thrones might appear to be, there are some potential Kingslayers among the eight shows nominated for Outstanding Drama Series. Chief among them is BBC America\u2019s buzzy spy serial Killing Eve, which only got buzzier in its second season, even without the voice of original head writer, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who devoted her energies to the second season of Fleabag. (If anything, the smash success of Fleabag has only raised Killing Eve\u2019s profile.) But if Twitter had a say, House Roy would handily defeat House Stark, as HBO\u2019s Succession has become a big mean meme-generating machine that Game of Thrones used to be. As the lone network drama in the bunch, a victory for This Is Us would represent the triumph of the old guard over the dominant forces of premium cable shows like Pose and Better Call Saul and streaming hits like Bodyguard and Ozark. But that\u2019s a battle that seems as ill-advised as starting a land war in Westeros.\n\nPrediction: Game of Thrones\n\nDon\u2019t Be Surprised By: Killing Eve\n\nWhat the Oddsmakers Say: BetOnline has Game of Thrones handily in the lead at -800, while Killing Eve is a distant second at +650.\n\nOutstanding Comedy Series\n\nView photos Tony Hale and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in Veep. (Photo: HBO) More\n\nNominees:\n\nBarry\n\nFleabag\n\nThe Good Place\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nRussian Doll\n\nSchitt\u2019s Creek\n\nVeep\n\nTwo returning comedy champions square off as HBO\u2019s three-time winner Veep chases after a final season statue, even as last year\u2019s victor, Amazon Prime\u2019s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, tries to stay one step ahead. But both shows could easily be lapped by Barry, Bill Hader\u2019s much-loved Hollywood satire, which is quickly emerging as an industry favorite. There\u2019s also a scenario in which the Anglophile contingent of Emmy voters power Fleabag to an upset victory, which would be a win for hot priests everywhere.\n\nPrediction: Veep\n\nDon\u2019t Be Surprised By: Barry\n\nWhat the Oddsmakers Say: Oddschecker places Veep on top with 5/4 odds, while poor Schitt\u2019s Creek brings up the rear at an even 40. For the record, that show is first in our hearts.\n\nOutstanding Limited Series\n\nView photos Jared Harris and Emily Watson in Chernobyl.
