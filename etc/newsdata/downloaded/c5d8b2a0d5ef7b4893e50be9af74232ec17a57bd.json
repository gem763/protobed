However, there are several competing cards with rewards and benefits that equal, or surpass, those of the Apple Card.\n\nFurthermore, you'll be unable to use many of the Apple Card's features if you don't have an iPhone. With that in mind, here are five great alternatives, depending on which aspect of the Apple Card appeals to you the most.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nIf you want a card with no fees: PenFed Promise\n\nPenFed is the Pentagon Federal Credit Union, and it was the first to offer a card with no fees for anything, including annual fees, late fees, foreign transaction fees, and even cash advance fees. And while it's not a rewards card, it does offer a $100 statement credit to those who spend $1,500 within the first 90 days of account opening, and it features 4.99% APR promotional financing for 12 months (then a variable rate of 11.99% to 17.99%). You must be a member of the PenFed credit union to apply, but no military service is required.\n\nIf you want to use an app to track your account and budget: The Petal Card\n\nWhile nearly all credit card issuers now offer a mobile app, the Apple Card has received attention for its unprecedented level of integration with the iPhone. Another card issuer that's been recognized for its innovative mobile app is Petal. The Petal card is very closely integrated with its app, which shows you how much interest you'll owe based on what you pay.\n\nThe app also allows you to set a monthly budget and track how your spending compares to that budget. Other features include the ability to freeze your card, view your credit score, and monitor your payment account to assure there's enough money before your payment is due. And like with the Apple Card, you receive your rewards when you make a purchase, and the card has no fees of any kind.\n\nIf you want a beautiful card: Amex Gold card\n\nThe Apple Card is made of titanium and has no visible number. The American Express Gold card is also eye-catching, and is constructed of metal. When this card was reintroduced in 2018, it was available in a limited-edition rose gold color \u2014 it's not currently available in this color, but the gold option looks pretty fancy, too.\n\nIts beauty is more than skin deep, as the Amex Gold features 4 points per dollar spent at restaurants worldwide and on up to $25,000 spent each year at US supermarkets (then 1x). You also get a $100 annual airline fee credit and up to $120 of credits each year toward purchases from select restaurants and food delivery services. Those credits go really far toward covering the $250 annual fee.\n\nIf you want to save money on Apple purchases: Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card\n\nThe Apple Card offers you 3% back on Apple purchases, which is pretty good. But if you're an Amazon Prime member and you open the Amazon Prime Visa Signature, you'll get a whopping 5% off of all your Amazon purchases, including Apple products and accessories, and at Whole Foods.\n\nIn contrast, you only earn 3% back from the Apple Card for Apple purchases and for Uber and Uber Eats when you use Apple Pay, 2% when using Apple Pay, and 1% elsewhere. In contrast, the Amazon Prime Rewards card offers 2% back at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores and 1% back on all other purchases. There's no annual fee for this card \u2014 you just need to be a Prime member.\n\nIf you want to earn bonus rewards on mobile wallet purchases: U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite Card\n\nThe Apple Card offers you 2% cash back on all purchases you make with Apple Pay, but the U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve goes even further. It features 3 points per dollar spent on all mobile wallet purchases, including Apple Pay and Android Pay. These points are worth as much as 1.5 cents each toward travel, which allows you to get up to a 4.5% return on your mobile wallet spending.\n\nYou also earn a 50,000-point bonus, worth $750 in travel, after spending $4,500 within the first 90 days of your account. Other benefits include 12 Gogo in-flight internet passes per year and Priority Pass Select airport lounge access. While the card does have a $400 annual fee, you also get a $325 in annual travel statement credits and up to a $100 credit toward the application fee for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck.\n\nRead more: The best rewards credit cards available now", "description": "The Apple Card has some unique features, but it's not the only option.
