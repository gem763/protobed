USA TODAY\n\nWith the Major League Baseball season over, it's time to hand out the hardware.\n\nMike Trout is likely to win his third MVP award in six years. And Cody Bellinger is set become a first-time winner.\n\nThe secret ballots for the American and National League MVPs won't be unveiled until after the World Series in November, but why not announce the winners now and crown an MVP on every team?\n\nFor many clubs, the choice was obvious. But for some, particularly on teams losing 90-plus games, the task was a little more difficult. But just like the All-Star Game, every team has to be represented.\n\nHere are our winners for each of the 30 teams:\n\nAL EAST\n\nDJ LeMahieu was arguably the best free agent signee last winter. (Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNew York Yankees \u2013 2B DJ LeMahieu: LeMahieu proved he could hit outside Coors Field. The free agent signee was the rock on a team decimated by injuries all season. He led the team in RBI, runs and made a run for the AL batting crown while filling in at first and third base.\n\nTampa Bay Rays \u2013 RHP Charlie Morton: Morton has gotten better with age. At 35, he set career highs and ranks in the top 5 in the AL in wins (16), ERA (3.05), strikeouts (240), batting average against (.215) and WHIP (1.08).\n\nBoston Red Sox \u2013 SS Xander Bogaerts: Bogaerts was one of the few bright spots on the defending World Series champs. He led all shortstops in doubles, RBI and OPS and became the first Red Sox shortstop with 30+ homers and 100+ RBI in a season since Nomar Garciaparra in 1998.\n\nToronto Blue Jays \u2013 Biggio, Bichette, Guerrero Jr. \u2013 This rookie trio made baseball fun to watch again North of the Border. The sons of three former All-Stars are the future of the franchise.\n\nBaltimore Orioles \u2013 OF Trey Mancini: Mancini had a breakout year in his third full season in the majors. Mancini, Alex Bregman and Anthony Rendon were the only hitters with at least 34 home runs, 35 doubles and 100 runs scored this season.\n\nAL CENTRAL\n\nMinnesota Twins \u2013 SS Jorge Polanco: With 22 homers, he ranks eighth on a team that slugged an MLB-record 307. Polanco, who is a season removed from serving an 80-game performance-enhancing drug suspension, was the teams' best player on offense and defense.\n\nCleveland Indians \u2013 RHP Mike Clevinger:Don't let his hippie\u2019 personality fool you. He posted double-digit strikeouts in seven of his 21 starts and finished with a 13-4 record and 2.71 ERA on a club just missing the playoffs.\n\nChicago White Sox \u2013 3B Yoan Moncada: After striking out a MLB-high 217 times in 2018, Moncada improved dramatically in his sophomore season. The superstar in the making finished with career highs in every major offensive category despite playing nearly 20 fewer games.\n\nKansas City Royals \u2013 DH Jorge Soler: Apologies to Whit Merrifield who had another solid season, but it's hard not to recognize Soler, who set a franchise record with 48 home runs.\n\nDetroit Tigers \u2013 RHP Shane Greene: Yes, he's no longer on the Tigers. But Greene's tenure in Detroit still holds after the first-time All-Star posted a 1.18 ERA in 38 appearances with 22 saves in Motown before he was traded to the Braves.\n\nAL WEST\n\nHouston Astros \u2013 3B Alex Bregman: Attitude. Swag. He's got both. And Bregman prefers World Series rings over MVP awards.\n\nMarcus Semien was the premiere lead off hitter in 2019. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOakland Athletics \u2013 SS Marcus Semien: On a team full of anonymous players headed to the postseason, Semien shined as one of the finest all-around shortstops in the league. Get this, he broke Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson\u2019s single-season franchise record for home runs from the leadoff spot with 29 earlier this month.\n\nTexas Rangers \u2013 LHP Mike Minor: Yes, it was fishy how he reached 200 strikeouts in his last start. But, he ranks tied for first in the majors in WAR for pitchers (7.8) with Justin Verlander, according the baseball-reference.com.\n\nLos Angeles Angels \u2013 OF Mike Trout: Not only is he the best player on his team, he's the best player in baseball. And yes, foot surgery ended his season mid-September, but after another historic season, the two-time AL MVP is the leading contender to win the award again this year.\n\nSeattle Mariners \u2013 LHP Marco Gonzales: This was a tough one. The Mariners used nearly 70 different players this year, so we'll give the nod to Gonzales, who led the club in WAR.\n\nNL EAST\n\nAtlanta Braves \u2013 OF Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr.: Power, speed is a deadly combination at the top of the lineup. Acu\u00f1a nearly joined Barry Bonds, Jose Canseco, Alfonso Soriano and Alex Rodriguez as the only players ever in the 40 home run-40 stolen base club. He finished with 41 homers, 37 stolen bases.\n\nWashington Nationals \u2013 3B Anthony Rendon: He made a case for the NL MVP in the second half, but will fall short. But, he played well enough to earn him a big cash payout this winter when he becomes a free agent.\n\nNew York Mets \u2013 1B Pete Alonso: He's livin' a dream. He set the franchise record for home runs and broke Aaron Judge\u2019s all-time rookie record with 53.\n\nPete Alonso ties the rookie record for home runs. (Photo: Noah K. Murray, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies \u2013 C J.T. Realmuto: He didn't arrive in Philly with the same fanfare as did Bryce Harper, who put up solid numbers. But Realmuto commanded respect behind the plate. He threw out an MLB-high 47 percent of stolen base runners.\n\nMiami Marlins \u2013 Pick 'em: Brian Anderson. Garrett Cooper. Sandy Alcantara. Miguel Rojas. Billy the Marlin. Let's let Derek Jeter choose.\n\nNL CENTRAL\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals \u2013 RHP Jack Flaherty: Apologies to Paul Goldschmidt, but Flaherty has been lights out since the All-Star break. After a 4-6 start and 4.64 ERA, the right-hander has allowed just 10 earned runs over 15 starts for a 0.91 ERA since the break.\n\nMilwaukee Brewers \u2013 OF Christian Yelich: The reigning MVP had better numbers this season than his 2018 campaign. A kneecap fracture on Sept. 11 ended his chances of repeating.\n\nChicago Cubs \u2013 1B Anthony Rizzo: Does anyone on this team want the ballyhoo? Javier Baez? Kris Bryant? After an abysmal meltdown in September, its hard to pick one, but we will opt for Rizzo.\n\nCincinnati Reds \u2013 3B Eugenio Suarez: Suarez set the record for most homers in a season (49) by an NL third baseman, passing Mike Schmidt and Adrian Beltre\u2019s single-season record. And, he also established a new single-season record for players from Venezuela, surpassing Andr\u00e9s Galarraga.\n\nPittsburgh Pirates \u2013 1B Josh Bell: The first-time All-Star posted a 30+ homer, 100+ RBI season after a sophomore slump. Now the question is if he will he follow in the footsteps of Andrew McCutchen as the next Pirates superstar?\n\nNL WEST\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers \u2013 OF Cody Bellinger: Bellinger, who slugged 47 homers, is the favorite to win the MVP in the NL \u2013 especially after Yelich's injury ended his season. He would be the first Dodgers' positional player to take home the award since Kirk Gibson in 1988.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks \u2013 INF/OF Ketel Marte: Had it not been for Marte's season-ending injury, he might have garnered a few more votes for NL MVP. He posted a .329/.389/.592 slash line and almost won the NL batting crown. He will finished second to Yelich by .0006 points.\n\nSan Francisco Giants \u2013 LHP Will Smith: The All-Star closer \u2013 not the actor or Dodgers catcher \u2013 reached rarified air for a team that struggled all season. He became just the second pitcher to finish a year 6-0 or better with at least 30 saves (6-0, 34). Minnesota\u2019s Joe Nathan went 7-0 with 36 saves in 2006.\n\nSan Diego Padres \u2013 SS Fernando Tatis Jr.: He was the most exciting player in baseball and would have given Alonso a run for his money for the Rookie of the Year award if he didn't have season-ending back surgery in August. At that point, the Padres went 15-27 without him.\n\nColorado Rockies \u2013 3B Nolan Arenado: Arenado might have had the best season of his career. He slugged 41 homers and finished with a career-high .962 OPS. But, he will once again be overlooked when it comes to the NL MVP award because of Bellinger, Yelich, Rendon and Marte.", "description": "Ballots for the AL and NL MVPs won't be unveiled until November, but why not crown an MVP for every team now that the regular season is over?", "authors": ["Scott Boeck", "Published A.M.
