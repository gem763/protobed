His response to this charge is, among other things, to demand investigations of even more political enemies.\n\nThe president\u2019s rants include demands that Rep. Adam Schiff be investigated for \u201cFraud\u201d and \u201cTreason.\u201d\n\nHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\nThe next day he proceeded to demands for Schiff\u2019s arrest:\n\nRep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nThis is literally what Trump is being impeached for. It\u2019s like a person accused of murder who becomes enraged during the trial and tries to strangle the prosecutor. How dare you accuse me of trying to investigate my enemies! I investigate you!", "description": "It\u2019s like a person accused of murder who becomes enraged during the trial and tries to strangle the prosecutor.", "authors": ["Jonathan Chait"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/26/trump_tweets.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
