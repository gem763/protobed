Smith.\n\nExcluding coined and technical terms (which can be arbitrarily long), the 28-letter word \u2018antidisestablishmentarianism\u2019 \u2013 opposition to the disestablishment of the Church of England \u2013 is widely considered the longest word for English speakers, although its use is rare\".\n\nThe longest word in Britain is the Welsh village name \u201cLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch\u201d, often, and understandably, shortened to \u201cLlanfair PG\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s Welsh weather presenter Liam Dutton\u2019s triumphant pronunciation.\n\n\n\nLatin Languages\n\nThe longest words in the Latin languages French, Spanish and Italian all rank in below 30 letters.\n\nThe Spanish language\u2019s \u201celectroencefalografista\u201d (23 letters) is \u201cthe medical worker that carries out electroencephalograms\u201d, French\u2019s \u201canticonstitutionnellement\u201d (25 letters), refers to something \u201cnot in accordance with the political constitution or with procedural rules\u201d, and Italian\u2019s \u201cprecipitevolissimevolmente\u201d (26 letters) is an adverb meaning \u201cas fast as possible\u201d.\n\nLong, but not the longest, words\n\nPortuguese and Danish have impressive 46-letter and 51-letter words respectively.\n\nTongue-tying \u201cpneumoultramicroscopicossilicovulcanoconi\u00f3tico\u201d is the longest word in Portuguese. It is a plural noun meaning sufferers of the disease pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, which may be familiar from the English-language category.\n\nThe Danish language permits nouns to be joined together meaning words can be arbitrarily long. However, the longest word known to have been used in practice is \u201cSpeciall\u00e6gepraksisplanl\u00e6gningsstabiliseringsperiode\u201d: A period of time where the planning in a specialist doctor\u2019s practice is stabilised.\n\nIt is also theoretically possible to create words of infinite length in Russian, but the 55-character-long \u201c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043f\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439\u201d which is the name for a type of arm is widely considered the longest non-scientific term.\n\nAccording to the Guinness World Records, a 172-letter Greek word that contains a whole recipe is the longest word ever to appear in literature.\n\nThe word represents a fictional dish mentioned in Aristophanes\u2019 comedy Assemblywomen.\n\nHowever, as this word is not used in modern Greek, the 24-character \u201c\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03b5\u03be\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u201d, which has the rather intriguing meaning \u201cwe are neutralising each other\u201d is widely considered the longest.\n\nThe longest, longest word\n\nNow for the real contenders.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman\n\nAs you might expect, the compound nature of the German language gave us the impressive \u201cGrundst\u00fccksverkehrsgenehmigungszust\u00e4ndigkeits\u00fcbertragungsverordnung\u201d \u2013 regulation on the delegation of authority concerning land conveyance permissions \u2013 weighing in at a hefty 67 characters and according to German-language Bible, the Duden, the language\u2019s longest word.\n\nIn fact, the longest word in German is difficult to pin down as there is no limit on the length of compounds and the language allows for users to make their own compounds when a sought-after word doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nThis results in the likes of Schauspielerbetreuungsflugbuchungsstatisterieleitungsgastspielorganisationsspezialist (85 letters) and the incredible Neunmilliardeneinhundertzweiundneunzigmillionensechshunderteinunddrei\u00dfigtausendsiebenhundertsiebzigfache (104 letters), however, these are not included in the Duden.\n\nHungarian\n\nIn at a close second is the Hungarian word \u201cElt\u00f6redezetts\u00e9gmentes\u00edt\u0151tlen\u00edttethetetlens\u00e9gtelen\u00edt\u0151tlenkedhetn\u00e9tek\u201d, which is such a mouthful our journalist needed three takes to crack it (and this, we are informed, is impressive!)\n\nHungarian is an agglutinative language, which means words of over 100 letters are possible, with enough creativity, but the aforementioned is largely recognised as the longest including by Dr Terts Istv\u00e1n from the \u201cUniversity of P\u00e9cs\u2019\u201chttps://pte.hu/english Faculty of Letters and Arts, Hungarian Linguistics Department.\n\nTurkish\n\nTurkish, also an agglutinative language, has the winning, 75-letter word \u201cMuvaffakiyetsizle\u015ftiricile\u015ftiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmi\u015fsinizcesinesiniz\u201d, which has the equally head-spinning definition: \u201cYou would be from those we can not easily/quickly make a maker of unsuccessful ones.\u201d We are assured it makes sense in Turkish!\n\nSo, can you say it?", "description": "No, this isn\u2019t a cheap gimmick to which you could reply with the two-letter word \u201cit\u201d;  the longest word in Turkish really is the breathtaking", "authors": ["Emma Beswick"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/372622/1000x563_372622.jpg", "published_at": "2017-06-12"}
