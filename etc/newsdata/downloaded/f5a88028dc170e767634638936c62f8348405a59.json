Watson was convinced by the Patriots to end his short retirement and sign a one-year deal worth $3 million. However, things did not go as planned for Watson as he was suspended for the first four games of the regular season after he was tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance.\n\nThe timing of Watson\u2019s return was ill-timed since it happened while the Patriots are desperate to create salary-cap room for them to trade for a wide receiver before the Oct. 29 trade deadline. Watson\u2019s suspension ended in Week 5, but the Patriots did not activate him for their game against the Washington Redskins on Sunday. The following day, the Patriots decided to release Watson, a move that gave them an additional $2 million in salary-cap room.\n\nWatson was drafted in the first round of the 2004 NFL and played with the Patriots until 2009, winning one Super Bowl ring while playing alongside veteran quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nWatson thanks Brady for the kind words\n\nThe 42-year-old Brady, in an interview with reporters, expressed disappointment over the move, calling Watson a \u201cgreat player.\u201d Brady also heaped praises on Watson for being \u201c10 times a better person with the highest integrity.\u201d In an interview with on WEEI's \"Ordway, Merloni and Fauria,\u201d Watson thanked Brady for the kind words.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL New England Patriots\n\nThe veteran tight end called Brady \u201cthe ultimate competitor.\u201d Watson added that part of the reason that he came out of retirement was to grab another opportunity to play with Brady.\n\nWhile he was disappointed that he didn\u2019t get a chance to play with Brady in the regular season, Watson said it was a privilege to play with the veteran quarterback in the preseason and in practice. Watson\u2019s dream of playing alongside Brady again could come true after Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said they could sign the tight end at some point this season.\n\nWatson says Brady hasn\u2019t changed\n\nWhen asked about the difference when they first played together and now, Watson said he hasn\u2019t noticed any change. \u201cHe's still elite. He still has energy. He still throws a great pass. He's still very, very sharp mentally, which he would even tell you is one of this biggest assets,\u201d said Watson.\n\nThe veteran tight end said he will cherish the moments that he sat in his locker beside Brady during training camp and talk about their respective families and about life.\n\nHall of Fame wide receiver Cris Carter said during FS1\u2019s \u201cFirst Things First\u201d that Brady would miss Watson\u2019s veteran presence and leadership in the locker room.", "description": "Watson said it was privilege to play with the veteran quarterback in the pre-season and in practice.", "authors": ["Zeegee Cecilio", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Patriots Rumor", "Team Won T Bring Back Troubled Wide Receiver Antonio Brown", "Patriots", "Bill Belichick Focused On Week Clash With Giants", "Not On Trade Deadline", "Tom Brady Heaps Praises On Ben Watson", "Belichick Opens Door For Tight End S Return"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/10/os/b_1200x630/watson-came-out-of-retirement-and-signed-a-one-year-deal-with-patriots-image-credit-new-england-patriotsyoutube_2336919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
