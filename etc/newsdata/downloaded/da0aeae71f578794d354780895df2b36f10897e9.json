The global stock market as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index fell to its lowest \u2014 wait for it \u2014 since Wednesday. And while there was a flight to safety, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note only dropped to its lowest since Thursday.\n\nThose moves may seem less than proportionate to the attack, which resulted in the sudden loss of 5.7 million barrels of oil a day, more than the 4.3 million lost during the 1990 Gulf War or the 5.6 million during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. But losing such a large amount of production in an $84.8 trillion global economy isn\u2019t the same as when the economy was just $37.9 trillion in 1990 or $27.4 trillion in 1979. The relatively muted moves also underscore how the global energy market has become more diversified, with the U.S. now a net exporter of crude oil and refined products. And while this may change if Saudi production doesn\u2019t come back online as quickly as forecast or if geopolitical risks escalate as a result of the attack, West Texas Intermediate crude prices \u2014 at about $63 a barrel on Monday, up more than $8 on the day \u2014 are still less than the $66.60 they reached in April and less than last year\u2019s high of $76.90 in October. Looked at another way, oil prices are up only 48% from last year\u2019s low on Christmas Eve. That may sound like a big move, but DataTrek Research notes that every U.S. economic downturn since 1970 has been preceded by a doubling of oil prices in the previous 12 months. Based on that, the firm figures that oil wouldn\u2019t be a problem for the economy until it reached $80 a barrel.\n\nLPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick points out that the last 10 times West Texas Intermediate crude futures surged more than 10%, the S&P 500 rose eight times. That fits the glass-half-full narrative, which is that with the U.S. a net exporter, higher oil prices might even spark investment in its energy-related industries. Even so, it\u2019s not as if the world is desperate for oil. As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Julian Lee pointed out, it was just a few days ago that OPEC and its allies were bemoaning the excessive inventories still sloshing around the world after more than two and a half years of supply restrictions.\n\nSTAGFLATION AHEAD?The big surge in oil prices had the bond market sending a rare and unusual signal Monday. On the one hand, U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors sought haven assets in case the attack escalates into a broad geopolitical crisis that further weighs on economic growth. On the other, breakeven rates on five-year Treasuries, a measure of what traders expect the rate of inflation to be over the life of the securities, rose to the highest since July. Of course, it\u2019s still early days, but so-called stagflation, in which economic growth slows to a stall and inflation accelerates, is a deadly combination for markets as seen in the 1970s. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is sure to get questions on what the oil spike means at his press conference on Wednesday after the central bank\u2019s policy meeting where it\u2019s expected to cut interest rates for the second time since July. Even before the jump in oil prices, investors were becoming jittery about evidence of faster inflation. The Labor Department said last week that the core U.S. consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in August, the first time it has risen that much for three consecutive months since the 1990s. If the report signals that the slowdown in inflation earlier this year truly was \u201ctransitory,\u201d as Powell has described it, it could call into question the need for further rate cuts as well as the historic low in bond yields.\n\nINDIA LOSES THE MOSTOne place where the surge in oil prices is likely to have a big impact is India. The rupee was the biggest loser in the currency market Monday, weakening as much as 1.06% and extending its decline over the past two months to 4.26%. The currency suffered a disproportionate hit not only because India is one of the world\u2019s biggest importers of oil, but because it also suffers from a deficit in its current account, which is the broadest measure of trade because it includes investment. Economists estimate that every dollar increase in the price of oil adds about $2 billion to India\u2019s costs to import crude. The timing is also not good, with the rupee already under pressure on concern that foreign funds may continue to head for the exits after economic growth slipped below trend of two consecutive months. Foreign funds pulled $2.3 billion from Indian shares in August, the biggest outflow since October. \u201cIf crude prices stay up, the Reserve Bank of India may not be able to deliver more than 25 basis points of cuts,\u201d Naveen Singh, head of fixed-income trading at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai, told Bloomberg News. As the \u201cI\u201d in the BRIC acronym that also includes Brazil, Russia and China, any lasting strength in Indian markets has the potential to lift emerging-market assets globally; the opposite can also happen.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The main takeaway from the biggest-ever surge in oil prices after an attack wiped out about half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s output capacity over the weekend is that it may not truly matter.
