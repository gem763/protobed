I know the public feels invested in my past relationship because they felt like that saw it thru from the beginning \u2026. I think that\u2019s why people have always felt so entitled over my life and how i live it because they watched me grow up\u2026. but I am grown now and make choices as an adult knowing the truth/details/reality. People only \u201cknow\u201d what they see on the internet.\"\n\nShe went on to make a second point in which she said that it is unfair how men and women are viewed differently if they have multiple relationships in a short period of time.\n\n(Image: Felipe Ramales / SplashNews.com)\n\nMiley continued: \"2. Men (especially successful ones) are RARELY slut shamed. They move on from one beautiful young women to the next MOST times without consequence. They are usually referenced as \u2018legends\u2019, \u2018heart throbs\u2019, \u2018G\u2019, \u2018Ladies Man\u2019 etc\u2026. where women are called sluts/whores! I am trying to just THRIVE/survive in a \u2018mans\u2019 world \u2026. if we can\u2019t beat em, join em! If our president can \u2018grab em by the p****\u2026.\u2019 can\u2019t I just have a kiss and acai bowl?!?!\"\n\nAround 20 minutes after posting her first two points, Miley returned to social media to share a few more thoughts on how she is treated compared to others.\n\nIn them, Miley has said that people need to get used to her dating as she 'refuses to become a recluse' and stay at home.\n\nShe continued: \"3. I refuse to recluse and \u2018date\u2019 from home cause A. That\u2019s not fun B. Extremely uncomfortable / puts me in a vulnerable position \u2026. i would like to share an activity with someone I am dating and not be stuck at home with pretty much nothing to do but \u2018 Netflix and chill\u2019\"\n\n(Image: Suzy Creamcheese / SplashNews.com)\n\n(Image: Felipe Ramales / SplashNews.com)\n\nMiley ended her rant by pointing out that she will be dating and that this is something everyone will have to get used to, as she will be looking to live life to the full after an intense period.\n\nShe ended with: \"4. This \u2018dating\u2019 thing is new to me too. I\u2019ve never been an \u2018adult\u2019/grown a** woman experiencing this \u2026, I was in a committed relationship for almost All my teens and early 20s; with the exception of a few breaks, which usually in those time I was working my ass off with not much R&R\u2026 and \u2018meeting/trusting\u2019 people in my position is really tuff. Don\u2019t f***ing pity me, not what I\u2019m asking for. I have a great life I wouldn\u2019t trade for \u2018privacy\u2019 but PLEASE don\u2019t make this awkward for me! I am trying to make light and like always MAKE FUN of myself / and the public\u2019s perception of me! Get used to me dating - this is where I am at! #HotGirlFall\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
