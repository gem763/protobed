The jury was shown the photo above of Tekashi posing with an assault rifle\n\nTekashi has said he hopes that the notoriety from the trial will reboot his career\n\nTHE CASE AGAINST THE NINE TREY GANGSTA BLOODS\n\nTekashi was one of five people charged by federal prosecutors in an indictment last November.\n\nAn additional six were later charged, bringing the total to 11.\n\nAll but two pleaded guilty to a variety of crimes including racketeering, drugs offenses and firearms offenses.\n\nSome have been sentenced and some, like Tekashi, are waiting for their sentenced.\n\nIt is unclear if any of the other defendants cut deals like he did to win leniency for themselves.\n\nThe 11 charged were: Jamel Jones aka Mel Murda, Kifano Jordan aka Shotti, Jensel Butler aka Ish, Daniel Hernandez aka Tekashi 69, Fuguan Lovick aka Fu Banga, Faheem Walter aka Crippy, Dernard Butler, aka Drama, Kintea McKenzie aka Kooda B, Roland Martin aka Roe Murda, Anthony Ellison aka Harv and Aljermiah Mack aka Nuke.\n\nMack and Ellison are the only two who did not plead guilty. Their trial is where Tekashi testified.\n\nAccording to prosecutors' indictment, they were all part of the violent Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods and committed, among other things, murder, robberies and drurg trafficking.\n\n'This gang...wreaked havoc on New York City, engaging in brazen acts of violence.\n\n'Showing reckless indifference to others\u2019 safety, members of the gang were allegedly involved in robberies and shootings, including a shooting inside the crowded Barclay\u2019s Center, and a shooting in which an innocent bystander was hit,' US Attorney Geoffrey S Berman said when the indictment was handed down.\n\nOver three days of testimony last month, 23-year-old rapper Tekashi - whose real name is David Hernandez - painted the Nine Treys as ruthless crew that used intimidation and violence to further their own criminal activity. He is seen in a leaked video from the courtroom\n\nTekashi (left in his mug shot) was charged along with five other Nine Trey members in November 2018 indictment outlining the gang's alleged involvement in drug sales and two shootings in New York City. The rapper (right during his September 17 testimony) immediately flipped against the others and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors\n\nTHE TRIAL AND TEKASHI'S TESTIMONY\n\nThe trial began September 16 with Tekashi serving as the state's primary witness.\n\nOver three days, he let rip on former gang mates.\n\nOn the first day of his testimony, he identified both defendants as members of the gang and said that while he was a part of it, he'd never shot anyone.\n\n'We participated in a lot of crimes. Robberies, assaults, drugs,' he said on the first day.\n\nHe said he believed they kept him around as a witness to what they were allegedly doing because he was rich and famous.\n\n'That\u2019s what people liked. It was just a formula, a blueprint that I found that worked,' he said.\n\nOn day two, he went further. At times he impersonated some of the other gang members as he recalled conversations he'd had with them, speaking so frantically and becoming so easily distracted that he had to be refocused by attorneys.\n\nHe translated street slang for the jury and listed the senior leadership of the gang by name without hesitation.\n\nHe also described being kidnapped by Ellison, one of the defendants, during a gang dispute over who would help run his career.\n\n'I had mad thoughts going through my head,' he said. He claimed he was being 'extorted' by the gang and that he turned on them because of it.\n\nJurors saw a video shot from the rapper's car showing how his driver gave chase\n\nA hospital photo of Tekashi69's injuries after he claims he was kidnapped at gunpoint and robbed by Ellison, one of the racketeering defendants, in July 2018\n\nThe defense questioned his version of the story, particularly when he said he escaped by jumping out of a moving car and into another, begging to be whisked away to safety.\n\nThe final day of his testimony was perhaps the most shocking.\n\nIt was then that he named Cardi B and Jim Jones as other members of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.\n\nHe had been asked if he joined the gang to further his career and answered 'yes'.\n\nLawyers then asked him if he 'knew' that Cardi B had also been in the gang. He replied 'yes' but said he did not pay attention to her career.\n\nCardi denied his allegations on Twitter, saying she had never been part of that gang but that she was part of 'Brim'.\n\nHe also implicated Jim Jones, another rapper, by identifying his voice while being played a recording of a conversation.\n\nTekashi said he and his entourage were at Barclays to watch an Adrien Broner fight when they ran into Casanova's crew in a tunnel under the venue and a brawl broke out\n\nThe prosecutor played the security footage and asked Tekashi to identify the people in it\n\nHOW HIP HOP REACTED\n\nSince he testified against his former colleagues, shocked rappers have been quick to distance themselves from Tekashi and to undermine his position in the industry.\n\nMany have described him as a 'hungry' internet star who clung to fame.\n\nSnoop Dogg described him as a 'rat' and compared him to Martha Stewart, his unlikely co-host on a VH1 cooking show.\n\n'As we watch Tekashi 69 (or whatever his name is) snitch on EVERYBODY, I invite you all to remember Martha Stewart snitched on NOT ONE soul during her trial.\n\n'Baby girl kept it 10 toes down and ate that prison sentence by herself, like the true baddie she is,' read a meme he posted.\n\nHe captioned it: 'That's my M. F. Home girl...solid as a rocc' (sic).\n\nStewart was jailed for five months for charges relating to insider trading in 2004.\n\nCardi hits back: Although Cardi's rep denied her affiliation to the Bloods, the Bronx rapper took to Twitter to say otherwise in a since-deleted post writing: 'You just said it yourself\u2026Brim not 9 Trey. I never been 9 trey or associated with them'\n\nShe also liked this tweet saying Cardi B was affiliation with the Brim Bloods, not the 9 Trey crew Tekashi ran with\n\nSorry, I don't know him! Cardi B threw shade at Tekashi on Thursday sharing this video of Keke Palmer's Vanity Fair interview where she scoffs and says: 'I don\u2019t know who this man is. I mean he could be walking down this street, I wouldn\u2019t know a thing. Sorry to this man'\n\nWHAT HAPPENS FOR TEKASHI NOW?\n\nTekashi has said he will not enter witness protection because he wants to maintain his public persona.\n\nHe said he would foot the bill of his own security and that he'd have bodyguards round the clock.\n\nWhether or not he'll be able to afford it is a different question.\n\nThe rapper's net worth is mysterious. Some say he is worth around $10million and others put his fortune significantly lower at around $1million.\n\nIn either case, his no-doubt mountainous legal bills will take a chunk out of whatever money he has, leaving a shrinking pot for round-the-clock protection.\n\nAs for who will want to make music with him now or endorse him, the prospects are bleak.\n\nNow a pariah in the hip hop and rap world, the self-proclaimed 'scumbag' no longer has the gang-bolstered Instagram profile he relied on to push his music and his stage personality before the trial.\n\nTekashi 69 first built his fanbase then turned to music after harvesting a following of 14.4million on Instagram\n\nHOW THE BROOKLYN NATIVE TURNED TO CRIME AFTER DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL AT 13\n\nHe grew up in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and dropped out of school after the 8th grade, he says to help his mother pay rent after the death of his father when he was 13.\n\nIn an interview about his childhood in 2017, he told the No Jumper podcast: 'My pops died in eighth grade, and I just started bugging in school. I was 13. I was waiting for my pops to come back home, and he never came.'\n\nTekashi has the numbers 69 tattooed on his body 200 times, including on his face\n\nHe started working and eventually turned to selling drugs to make money. Soon afterwards, he adopted his alter ego that was based on his obsession with Japanese culture.\n\nTekashi69 was born and he began chronicling his life on social media. After amassing 15 million Instagram followers, he started rapping.\n\nIn court, he described his persona as one of a 'scumbag'.\n\nHe has the numbers 69 tattooed hundreds of times across his body - including on his face - and frequently refers to its sexual connotations.\n\nIn photos, he posed with guns, money, drugs and alcohol. All of it was for 'shock value', he told the court, and he is in fact 'Danny, a nice kid from Brooklyn.'\n\nIn court, he said his rap career began when someone told him he looked 'cool'.\n\n'At the store I was working in, Stay Fresh Grill, there was a guy by the name Peter Rogers always, always coming in there, buying things like tilapia, peanuts, stuff like that.\n\n'He asked me if I, if I made music, if I rap. I was like,\n\n'No. And he was like: Well, you got the image for it. You look cool. I was like, you know, I took it into consideration, and we started making music with the guy,' he said.\n\nTekashi went on to have some success with his expletive-laden rap songs Stoopid and Dummy before finding himself in legal trouble.\n\nSEX TAPE OF A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL SPARKED RAPPER'S LEGAL WOES\n\nTekashi was arrested first in 2015 for taking part in the production and dissemination of a sex tape involving a 13-year-old girl.\n\nHe was not the man who had sex with her, and was given a probation sentence for his role because he had shown 'remorse'.\n\nThe sentencing occurred in October 2018. He had already been arrested while awaiting sentencing for it for assault and for driving without a license.\n\nThe following month, federal prosecutors who had been investigating the Nine Trey gang charged Tekashi in their indictment.\n\nHe was put in jail and, the next day, made a deal with prosecutors to inform on the others charged in exchange for leniency.\n\nIt was unclear how much weight his testimony would carry given his extensive rap sheet.\n\nIn court proceedings, Tekashi suggested that his brash stunts and penchant for violence - primarily his involvement in Nine Trey - were all part of his effort to bolster his 'bad boy' public persona.", "description": "Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods members Anthony 'Harv' Ellison (left) and Aljermiah 'Nuke' Mack (right) were found guilty in Manhattan federal court on Thursday.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets", "Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/21/19269044-0-image-a-23_1570133588532.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
