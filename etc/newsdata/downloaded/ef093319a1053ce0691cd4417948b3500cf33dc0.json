Some springs have dried up from overextraction; others have shown signs of saltwater intrusion and harmful algae blooms.\n\nAt least 60 springs discharge from the Floridan aquifer into the Santa Fe River, which runs 75 miles through north-central Florida. This aquifer is the primary source of drinking water in the state. The state and local governments have continued to issue water bottling extraction permits that prevent the aquifer from recharging.\n\nThe answer to this problem is simple: No more extraction permits should be granted, and existing permits should be reduced with the goal of eliminating bottled water production entirely in Florida. At the very least, corporations should be taxed for the water they now extract free of charge. That revenue can be used to pay for water infrastructure projects.\n\nIn the next few months, Nestl\u00e9 is set to renew its permit at Ginnie Springs, one of the most popular recreational attractions along the Santa Fe River. The permit allows Nestl\u00e9 to take one million gallons per day at no cost, with just a one-time $115 application fee.", "description": "The state\u2019s aquifers are shrinking, yet corporations want to appropriate even more of them.", "authors": ["Michael Sainato", "Chelsea Skojec"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/opinion/12sainato/12sainato-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
