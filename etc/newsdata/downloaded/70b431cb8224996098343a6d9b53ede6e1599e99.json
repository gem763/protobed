The outside of those phones is thought to be largely similar to the current iPhone line-up, but they will have improved cameras and other internal hardware.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe invitation appears to offer what might be a clue about the new phone. It features a colourful Apple logo, which recalls the old design of Apple's classic iMacs \u2013 and Apple has already been rumoured to be offering a nostalgic, rainbow-themed version of the iPhone this year.\n\nThe phones will almost certainly arrive around a week and a half after the event. Previous release schedules suggest the phones could arrive around 20 September \u2013 and, for the first time, Apple is expected to release all three of them at once.\n\nAs well as the iPhones, Apple could also reveal new Apple Watches, MacBooks, iPads and other products. While a host of other products have been rumoured to be launching, nothing has been confirmed \u2013 and Apple occasionally pushes such other launches to another event in October, to ensure that the iPhone gets sufficient attention.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That software appears to have run into some problems, with the company seemingly pushing some of its main features into later in the year \u2013 and the event will presumably serve as an opportunity for the company to explain that strange release schedule.\n\nThe event will be held in Apple's Steve Jobs Theater, which was built as part of its vast new California campus, specifically for events of this kind. It was first used to introduce the iPhone X and 8 in 2017, and has played host to a number of press events since.", "description": "Apple has announced when it will unveil the iPhone 11 to the world.
