He left us in this mess and we are still suffering. The Bible says your deeds, good or bad, will follow you. His will surely haunt him on the other side,\u201d Makoto said.\n\nNetsai Gute, a 68-year-old retired civil servant whose pension was wiped out by runaway inflation caused by Mugabe\u2019s economic mismanagement, said the former leader had become a distant \u201cgodlike\u201d figure who believed himself infallible and indispensable.\n\n\u201cHe was heartless \u2026 Everything that we fought for he threw in the mud. May God have mercy on his soul, because he left Zimbabwe worse off. My generation does not have a decent pension because of him, I can not afford a decent burial because of him. Surely justice must now take its course, and he will be punished as he deserves\u201d Gute said.\n\nMugabe\u2019s Zanu-PF party remains in power and is blamed by many in Zimbabwe for the country\u2019s deep problems.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwa, who became president after Mugabe\u2019s fall, expressed his condolences to the former leader\u2019s family on Twitter and described his predecessor as a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to his country.\n\nMnangagwa promised to bring foreign investment to Zimbabwe and restore full relations with the international community when he took power.\n\nBut early hopes of reform were dashed when violence followed a contested election. There have since been several waves of repression, targeting opposition and labour activists as well as pro-democracy campaigners.\n\nWith no prospect of a major international bailout, an already grave economic crisis is deepening. Millions face shortages of power, clean water and affordable food. Hospitals are short of medicine. Few people have steady employment.\n\nZanu-PF officials frequently blame international sanctions for the country\u2019s problems, but most analysts point to systematic mismanagement and widespread corruption.\n\nTendai Biti, a former finance minister and opposition politician, said it was important to acknowledge the massive destruction caused by Mugabe as well as the late leader\u2019s role in Zimbabwe\u2019s independence struggle.\n\n\u201cA giant has fallen, a man who was a coalition of controversies, who failed to transform himself from a liberation leader to a national leader,\u201d Biti said.\n\nYet there is still some fondness for a man seen by many as a national hero for his role in fighting the white supremacist regime in the former British colony in the 1970s.\n\nElvis Gwekwerere, 35, a taxi driver, said he was \u201cin pain\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are who we are because of him. Zimbabwe feels like it does not have a president at the moment since he left power. The gap that he left will never be filled.\u201d\n\nMassa Munetsi, 25, a University of Zimbabwe student, said Zimbabwe was better under Mugabe and his successor had failed to live up to people\u2019s expectations.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, despite his flaws, we need to forgive and forget. Surely we all make mistakes and we shouldn\u2019t forget that he fought for this country. During his time things were not this hard, but now we are suffering,\u201d Munetsi said.\n\n\u201cWe will miss him. When he fell from power, people were happy because they felt a new government had come, but now we regret the old days. Forgive us, Uncle Bob.\u201d\n\nMonica Mutsvangwa, the information minister, described Mugabe as a father figure. \u201cSome of us, we were like his children to him. We can never write our history without mentioning him,\u201d she said.", "description": "Zimbabweans in capital bemoan lingering legacy of former leader\u2019s economic and political misrule", "authors": ["Nyasha Chingono", "Jason Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2b0c099e6c5e01535220ee5ce6e051a05c295ed/0_152_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65fb0e5534c28cdc00db5aabbb53166e", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
