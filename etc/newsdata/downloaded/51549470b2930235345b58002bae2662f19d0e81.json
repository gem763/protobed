Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris said the White House never consulted with them about the nominee. As a result of the initial pushback, the White House instead decided to nominate Mr. Bumatay to a district court seat.\n\nBut the pick lingered in the Senate Judiciary Committee for about eight months after neither senator turned in a blue slip, a Senate tradition showing approval of a nominee, for his nomination to the district court. So the president decided to try to elevate him again to the 9th Circuit, officially nominating him Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats play identity politics and they don\u2019t want President Trump to nominate Patrick Bumatay, a highly qualified judicial nominee, who happens to be Filipino and happens to be gay, to the court of appeals,\u201d said Mike Davis, president of the Article III Project, which backs the president\u2019s judicial nominees.\n\nThe president previously tapped Judge Mary M. Rowland, who is openly gay, for the Northern District of Illinois, but Mr. Bumatay could be the president\u2019s first gay nominee elevated to a federal circuit seat.\n\nMr. Bumatay\u2019s nomination is likely to spark a second confrontation with Ms. Harris and the Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, Ms. Feinstein.\n\nMs. Feinstein objected to his nomination in October, saying the lack of consultation with either home state senator \u201creflects President Trump\u2019s desire to remake the court.\u201d\n\nMs. Feinstein, though, did not comment on Mr. Bumatay Friday.\n\nMs. Harris didn\u2019t mention Mr. Bumatay by name, but she took to Twitter to chastise the White House for trying to \u201cpush through a flawed nominee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis process is broken. It\u2019s clear Republicans care more about politics and raw power than finding a qualified nominee. We must fight,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nBut the 41-year-old assistant U.S. attorney has the backing of the National Filipino American Lawyers Association.\n\n\u201cHe would be the first Filipino-American judge to ever serve on a federal appeals court, the second openly LGBT federal circuit court judge, and the second Filipino-American Article III judge in the history of the United States,\u201d the association said in a June letter to the president urging the nomination.\n\nMr. Bumatay would replace Judge Carlos Bea, who announced this summer he would be taking senior status.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who tracks judicial nominations, said Mr. Bumatay is \u201cwell qualified\u201d and likely will be confirmed by the end of the year.\n\nThe president also picked Lawrence VanDyke of Nevada for another vacancy on what has been dubbed the country\u2019s most liberal federal appeals court.\n\nBoth nominees enjoy support from the president\u2019s conservative base, including from Mr. Trump\u2019s former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who cheered the nomination of Mr. Bumatay.\n\n\u201cPatrick\u2019s many fine qualities, including his integrity, intellect and collegiality, make him exceedingly worthy of this position,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cAnd his fidelity to the text of the Constitution is exactly what this country needs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, which backs the president\u2019s judicial nominees, said Mr. VanDyke would protect vital interests facing the people living in the 9th Circuit. The court hears appeals from Washington, Montana, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, California, Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii.\n\n\u201cWith deep roots in the West, Lawrence is very familiar with the challenges faced by states in the 9th Circuit, and, as solicitor general for Montana and Nevada, he was on the front lines of the legal challenges to the overreach by the Obama administration and its job-killing [Environmental Protection Agency],\u201d Ms. Severino said.\n\nBefore Mr. Trump took office, the appeals court had 16 Democrat-appointed active judges, compared to five appointed by Republicans. Since then, the breakdown has changed to 12 GOP-appointed.\n\nIf both men are confirmed, the president would have placed nine judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit.\n\n\u2022 Valerie Richardson contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
