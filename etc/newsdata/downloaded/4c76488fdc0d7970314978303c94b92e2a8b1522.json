He raised more than $23 million for his 2017 special election campaign \u2014 at the time, the most expensive House race in history \u2014 and drew national attention for being competitive in a district, Georgia\u2019s Sixth, that had not elected a Democrat since 1976.\n\nHe came close to winning outright in the first round of voting, but lost a runoff to a Republican, Karen Handel, by about four percentage points. (Ms. Handel lost re-election to another Democrat, Lucy McBath, in 2018.) It was a devastating loss for Democrats, but also a remarkable achievement in the Sixth District, which the former House speaker Newt Gingrich held for 20 years and Republicans normally won by double digits.\n\nBefore taking charge of a documentary film company, Mr. Ossoff, 32 \u2014 if he won, he would be the youngest sitting member of the Senate by a large margin, behind 39-year-old Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri \u2014 spent five years working for Representative Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat.\n\nThree other Democrats are already running for Mr. Perdue\u2019s seat: Mayor Ted Terry of Clarkston; former Mayor Teresa Tomlinson of Columbus; and Sarah Riggs Amico, who ran for lieutenant governor last year on Ms. Abrams\u2019s ticket.\n\nGeorgia has not elected a Democratic senator in almost 20 years, but Democrats have believed for some time that the state is trending in their direction because of its changing demographics. The numbers bear that out: In 2016, President Trump\u2019s margins of victory in Iowa and Ohio, both swing states, exceeded his margin of victory in Georgia.", "description": "Mr. Ossoff, a former documentary filmmaker who nearly flipped a conservative House district in 2017, will run in one of two Senate races in the state next year.", "authors": ["Maggie Astor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/us/politics/09ossoff/09ossoff-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
