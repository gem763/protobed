Definitely,\" Ronning says. \"I felt in the first film, (the lips) were a bit saturated. I wanted to make them feel a little more natural, a little cooler and darker \u2013 but keeping them the red, red, red.\"\n\nRonning says he and Jolie went back and forth before agreeing upon the film's no-shine MAC Matte Russian Red lipstick.\n\n\"It's so important to her. So it was pretty much Angelina and I, battling it out. But at the end of the day, we agreed. We changed the color a bit,\" says Ronning, who notes that the decision ultimately rested with Jolie, one of the film's producers. \"When she gets happy, then I get happy. That\u2019s the order of things.\"\n\nAngelina Jolie shows off her Maleficent power collar.

A high collar has always been a Maleficent trademark. But the bird-boned look tipped in gold, worn over a black silk gown, was next level. It was needed in the faceoff with Ingrith, who wears a formidable bodice covered in diamonds and jewels.\n\nAngelina Jolie's Maleficent squares off with Michelle Pfeiffer's Queen Ingrith.

The sequel reveals that Maleficent isn't the only winged fairy as a whole colony of dark fey (led by Chiwetel Ejifor and Ed Skrein), driven into hiding by humans, step out to back her.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor plays horned fairy Conall in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\nThe increased flight time, along with more fairies, meant some problems as Jolie filmed on wires with her horned co-stars.\n\n\"There were times Angelina and I would be flying around on the wires, and we\u2019d get our horns locked,\" Skrein says. \"We would literally get entangled.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/15/angelina-jolie-fought-for-maleficent-2-red-lips/3970928002/", "description": "Angelina Jolie's dark fairy Maleficent returns with a new shade of red on those famous lips.
