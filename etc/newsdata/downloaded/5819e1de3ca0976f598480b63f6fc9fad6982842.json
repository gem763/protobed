Which Did They Choose?", "language": "en", "text": "Irene and Rick Hoefert were ready to upend their lives and move to New York from their longtime home in California. Their two sons had left for college, and a year ago Mr. Hoefert, who works in technology, accepted a job in Lower Manhattan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big move and late-stage career move,\u201d he said. But the couple, both in their 50s, were ready to forsake \u201cthe California driving lifestyle for the walking city of New York, which I had mostly visited during business trips over the last 30 years.\u201d\n\nThey liked the vibe, the neighborhoods, the people, the food. \u201cThe general energy in the city was very appealing to me,\u201d he said, \u201cat a time in my career when I had sold a business and gone through semi-retirement and thought, \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey aimed to buy a dog-friendly home in or near TriBeCa, within walking distance of Mr. Hoefert\u2019s office and near a park for Chester, their English golden retriever. \u201cChester is so used to having a doggy door and a whole side yard,\u201d Ms. Hoefert said.\n\n[Did you recently buy or rent a home in the New York metro area? We want to hear from you. Email: thehunt@nytimes.com]\n\nThe Hoeferts were looking for enough space to host their sons and overnight guests. But even with a budget of $2 million to $2.5 million, they found that many places felt small, especially compared to their three-bedroom house with a pool in the Los Angeles suburbs.\n\nA real two-bedroom in TriBeCa pushed them out of their price range, so a one-bedroom with extra space made sense.\n\nFor about eight months, Mr. Hoefert lived in corporate housing in Battery Park City while Ms. Hoefert remained in California with Chester, visiting occasionally.\n\nAt an open house, they met Todd Vitolo, a licensed associate broker on the Columbia Vitolo team at Compass. He showed them many of the new developments in and around TriBeCa.\n\nAmong their choices:", "description": "With their children out of the house and a new job on the East Coast, two transplants come to grips with New York City floor plans.
