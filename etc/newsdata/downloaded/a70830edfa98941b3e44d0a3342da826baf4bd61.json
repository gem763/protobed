Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nFor a lot of Democrats, the impeachment timetable is of considerable interest in part because they tend to think of it as preceding, not overlapping, with the formal 2020 election season. But even if it does overlap, it\u2019s probably not that big a deal so long as you have the time and energy to follow two very big stories at once.\n\nBut for six particular Democratic presidential candidates and their campaigns (Michael Bennet, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren), the possibility of a Senate impeachment trial occurring during the early stages of the caucus/primary season represents a potential calamity. And as the Washington Post reports, that\u2019s a real possibility, particularly if the House drags its feet for reasons ranging from administration obstruction to the desire not to spoil the festive holiday spirit:\n\nHouse Democrats increasingly expect their impeachment effort against President Trump to stretch well past Thanksgiving, possibly forcing a Senate trial into January or later \u2014 a timeline that could disrupt the final weeks of campaigning before the party starts to choose its nominee.\n\nHouse leaders had initially hoped to hold a floor vote before the Nov. 28 holiday so the Senate could hold trial before Christmas. But the surprising number of witnesses agreeing to testify behind closed doors in the Capitol over the past few weeks has extended the timeline and sparked a debate over whether prolonged impeachment proceedings are politically prudent.\n\nThe standing Senate rules do require a fairly expeditious beginning for impeachment trials after the House has passed articles of impeachment, so it\u2019s not like Mitch McConnell can deviously get it rolling the night of the Iowa Caucuses. But if the House really doesn\u2019t get its part done until well into December, you could easily see a trial running through the critical pre-Iowa stretch of frenzied activity. The Clinton trial, which was about as cut-and-dried as any presidential impeachment trial could be, lasted from January 7 until February 12, 1999. Let\u2019s say for the sake of argument a Trump trial begins and ends precisely on those dates in 2020. It would encompass both the Iowa Caucuses (February 3) and the New Hampshire primary (February 11). If it started later or ran longer, it could directly interfere with the Nevada Caucuses (February 22), the South Carolina primary (February 29) or \u2014 worst-case scenario \u2014 the 12 states (including California and Texas) holding primaries or caucuses on Super Tuesday (March 3).\n\nAn impeachment trial doesn\u2019t allow for time off to do campaign events: The Senate rules require that once the trial begins, it must stay in session six days a week. Perhaps some senators think they could make more hay at an impeachment trial than they could hitting the potluck circuit in Iowa or working street-corners in New Hampshire, as the Post suggests:\n\nSeveral senators running for president, including Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a former state prosecutor, are likely to try to use a trial of Trump as a showcase for their candidacy.\n\nUnfortunately, the current Senate rules compel virtual silence from senators during the trial itself, though they are free to run their mouths before it begins and after it ends. During the trial, unless precedents are ignored, all senators get to do is to send written questions to be posed by the House managers or the president\u2019s attorneys, and then stand up and vote \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cnot guilty\u201d when the deal goes down. Not much room for showboating there.\n\nNow I suppose it\u2019s possible the rules could be interpreted in a way that would allow Kamala Harris and her senatorial rivals to leave the Capitol building each night of the trial, go two blocks away, and make brilliant presentations on the case against Trump or anything else that popped into their heads. But that\u2019s likely going to be subject to ad hoc impeachment trial rules that a majority of the Senate \u2014 e.g., the Republican majority \u2014 will impose. It\u2019s doubtful GOP senators will feel inclined to accommodate the political needs of their Democratic colleagues. In talking about the precedents dictating silence, McConnell said earlier this month:\n\nMcConnell \u2026 warned that senators won\u2019t be allowed to speak because they are jurors. McConnell said such silence \u201cwould be good therapy for a number of them.\u201d\n\nIf an impeachment trial is a headache for those six senators (or however many of them are still in the race if any when this all happens), it could be a boon to non-senators \u2014 particularly Joe Biden, who can bloviate to his heart\u2019s desire about the lessons he learned on impeachment and all the issues involving Trump during his 44 years as a member or presiding officer of the Upper Chamber.\n\nFor candidates and their staff, all these contingencies make the already difficult task of planning and executing a campaign in the hothouse atmosphere of this cycle impossibly tricky. And for senators who want to be president, knowing that Mitch McConnell and his troops will get the final say on some of the most crucial questions of timing and procedure is like knowing that Satan gets one final shot at your soul right there at the Pearly Gates.", "description": "If a Trump impeachment trial happens just prior or after the caucus-and-primary season begins, senators running for president (six at present) could be in a real bind, stuck in the Capitol and forced into silence until it\u2019s over.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/30/30-sanders-warren.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
