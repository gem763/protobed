Totals were not quite as high Tuesday as in other recent events, but slow and steady gets the job done \u2014 and it\u2019s going to make for a messy commute. It\u2019s all thanks to a front passing by. Once that front moves out, beautiful fall conditions return Wednesday.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Keep an eye out for ponding on roads as you head home. The heaviest is passing, and consistent rain moves east this evening, tending to taper locally by 7 p.m. We could see a random shower after. Skies tend to start breaking once the rain ends, and we end up mainly clear overnight into morning. Lows reach the mid-40s to low 50s. Winds are from the northwest around 10 mph behind the front.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Wednesday): Sunshine returns. It\u2019s a pretty fall day, as long as you don\u2019t mind some wind. Highs end up in the mid-60s to around 70. Those winds are out of the northwest around 10 to 15 mph, with some gusts into the 25 mph range or so. Not too bad.\n\n\n\nRainy day views.

This latest round of rain pushes the city past the October average for rainfall, making it the first wetter-than-normal month since July. See ya, drought?\n\nPollen update: Before the rain, mold spores were low/moderate.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
