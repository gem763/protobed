The latest instance in this profoundly frustrating phenomenon involves a report from Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker detailing the MIT Media Lab\u2019s acceptance of Epstein-tainted money well after his 2008 conviction for soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.\n\nDespite his own connections with elite financiers, Media Lab director Joi Ito approved not only two donations from Epstein worth $1.725 million, but allowed the convicted pedophile to \u201cdirect\u201d funds from other ultrarich benefactors to the school. Those gifts are said to include $2 million from Bill Gates in 2014 and $5.5 million from Leon Black, the founder of the massive private-equity firm Apollo Global Management.\n\nEpstein was \u201cdisqualified\u201d from the donor base of the MIT Media Lab \u2014 something of an East Coast answer to the cash-rich tech optimism of Stanford \u2014 so Ito and the lab\u2019s director of development and strategy, Peter Cohen, reportedly had to hide his fundraising role, writing in emails that \u201cJeffrey money needs to be anonymous.\u201d When meeting with the financier on-campus, they wrote only \u201c J.E.\u201d on their public schedule.\n\nThat Ito attempted to obscure Epstein\u2019s involvement in the donation process isn\u2019t all that surprising: To rub shoulders with Epstein then pretend it never happened is a common game in elite institutions. But why would an institution as tech-famous as the MIT Media Lab require a pariah financier to contact two billionaires who are highly active in public life and philanthropy?\n\nBill Gates and MIT certainly didn\u2019t need an introduction from Epstein: In 1999, the Microsoft co-founder donated $20 million to the university for a computer lab named after himself designed by Pritzker-winning architect Frank Gehry. And it\u2019s not like Gates would have required any rigorous arm-pulling to hand a paltry $2 million over to the school: With a net worth of around $104 billion, the second-wealthiest man in the U.S. is so rich that his $2 million MIT donation is equivalent to an average American spending just $2. Though the New Yorker reported that Ito wrote in an internal email, \u201cThis is a $2M gift from Bill Gates directed by Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d Gates has released several statements in recent days denying that his donations were made through Epstein. A spokesperson told the New Yorker that \u201cany claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grantmaking for Bill Gates is completely false.\u201d On Monday, a Gates representative told the AP that his 2014 donation went directly to the university and wasn\u2019t dedicated to the program Epstein was fundraising for, adding that his office wasn\u2019t aware of any discussions between Epstein and the lab.\n\nConsidering Leon Black\u2019s reputation in philanthropic circles, one also imagines that a school with a donation-industrial complex wouldn\u2019t have to rely on one of the world\u2019s most toxic middlemen to get a hold of him. Black, the chairman of MoMA worth almost $8 billion, has donated extensively to arts organizations and to melanoma research, following his wife\u2019s diagnosis in 2007.\n\nIt certainly seems plausible that Joi Ito or professional fundraiser Peter Cohen would be able to contact these men. Ito, an early investor in Twitter, Kickstarter, and Flickr, was recently described by the New York Times as a \u201cmaster networker \u2014 one who visited the Obama White House to discuss artificial intelligence and became friends with the respected Harvard lawyer Lawrence Lessig after criticizing Mr. Lessig\u2019s book when he gave a talk in Japan.\u201d And yet, the MIT Media Lab reportedly pursued Black\u2019s and Gates\u2019s donations through Epstein, even though some of Ito\u2019s staff referred to the financier as \u201che who must not be named.\u201d Management tip: If your personnel likens a business partner to Voldemort, it\u2019s a bad sign.\n\nLike so many questions in the Epstein scandal, this leaves those of us outside the rarefied circle wondering why elite institutions would participate in the laundering of a serial child abuser\u2019s money and reputation. Though MIT is part of a larger academic and philanthropic reckoning with accepting the money of bad men, Ito is taking the fall: Within 24 hours, he resigned from his position at MIT, and soon left his visiting professorship at Harvard, as well as his board seats at the MacArthur Foundation, the New York Times Company, and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Cohen has been placed on paid administrative leave at Brown University, where he is currently employed as a director of development for computer science and data initiatives. He said in a statement released Tuesday that despite his \u201cpersonal discomfort regarding Mr. Epstein,\u201d he does not feel he was in a position to change MIT\u2019s procedures for handling Epstein donations, which were established before his hiring. MIT\u2019s general counsel has contacted an outside law firm to oversee an independent investigation into the matter.\n\nThis sub-scandal in the larger Epstein web shows, again, that most of the upper-upper echelon seems to fit nicely within a little black book. Prior to their MIT gifts, both donors knew Epstein. In 2013, according to a report from CNBC, Gates met with the financier in New York after being \u201cinundated with outreach\u201d from Epstein\u2019s camp, who wanted to discuss \u201cgrowing philanthropy.\u201d After the meeting, Gates \u2014 then chairman of Microsoft \u2014 hitched a ride to Florida on Epstein\u2019s private plane. In a Wall Street Journal interview published Tuesday, which was conducted before the MIT donation story broke, Gates downplayed his relationship with the financier:\n\nI met him. I didn\u2019t have any business relationship or friendship with him. I didn\u2019t go to New Mexico or Florida or Palm Beach or any of that. There were people around him who were saying, hey, if you want to raise money for global health and get more philanthropy, he knows a lot of rich people. Every meeting where I was with him were meetings with men. I was never at any parties or anything like that. He never donated any money to anything that I know about.\n\nBlack, too, had post-conviction contacts with Epstein, though his were more extensive. Black\u2019s family foundation listed Epstein as its director until 2012, though it now claims he was ditched in 2007 due to a \u201crecording error.\u201d But sightings of the two together at a movie screening just months after Epstein\u2019s probation lapsed in 2010, and of Epstein at Black\u2019s home in the Hamptons in 2015 show a more recent, and more personal, connection.\n\nPerhaps the only excuse MIT has for accommodating Epstein in their fundraising practice is his claim that he would ensure that funds donated by Gates and Black would be matched by the John Templeton Foundation, a nonprofit that supports scientific research dealing with matters of faith. (A spokesperson told the New Yorker there was no such arrangement on the organization\u2019s books.) But even that glimmer of justification for bringing Epstein in is dampened by the on-the-ground details: When development director Peter Cohen told former Media Lab development associate and alumni coordinator Signe Swenson of Epstein\u2019s involvement, he seemingly did so \u201cto test whether I would be confidential and sort of feel out whether I would be okay with the situation,\u201d she said.\n\nA handful of people involved in this episode did raise the moral concerns about Epstein that have proven to be in deficit among the global elite. Swenson said that in the summer of 2015, \u201cit hit\u201d her that \u201cthis pedophile is going to be in our office.\u201d When Epstein showed up, he brought along two female \u201cassistants,\u201d whom Swenson described as Eastern European\u2013looking models. \u201cAll of us women made it a point to be super nice to them,\u201d she told the New Yorker. \u201cWe literally had a conversation about how, on the off chance that they\u2019re not there by choice, we could maybe help them.\u201d Swenson resigned the next year, though she says she still \u201cfeels guilty.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
