Big damage claims came from a hailstorm in southeast Queensland\u2019s Gympie in October last year and the massive flood in Townsville in central Queensland in February this year.\n\nBut the insurance arm\u2019s revenues also jumped 8.7 per cent in the year, up from $819 million to $890 million. Macquarie analysts, in a recent client note, argued that auto clubs such as RACQ were reaping greater market share.\n\nThat was partly as big ASX-listed insurers tried to recapture losses by jacking up prices nationally, providing a \u201ccomfortable price advantage\u201d to more geographically focused insurers such as auto clubs, Macquarie analysts said.\n\nThe banking arm, acquired in the merger of QT Mutual in 2016, posted a deeper loss of $16.8 million against $8.5 million. Net interest income edged up slightly but other expenses also lifted, with Mr Gillespie saying additional investment had been made in technology.\n\nHe also said loans had grown more than 18 percent over the year, to $1.75 billion.\n\nYet RACQ has also stowed away a $5 million provision to compensate financial planning clients who might have been charged fees for no service, or who RACQ cannot show were given the services promised. A $1.2 million impairment charge was also notched against the financial planning arm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Gillespie said two remediation claims had been made to date, with the financial planning service having come following the merger. Other customer-owned institutions, such as CUA, have also been hit but the amounts are minute in comparison to big banks such as CBA, which has set aside more than $2 billion in remediation payouts.\n\nRACQ has in recent years unsuccessfully sounded out other lenders to merge, including fellow mutuals QCCU and Heritage Bank, and ASX-listed Auswide. Questions have also been raised about whether its expansion has been slower than hoped.\n\nBut Mr Gillespie said growth had been heartening, and while RACQ remained focused on growing the bank naturally it was also open to any merger talks.\n\nThe result was buffered by a strong lift in investment returns in its insurance arm, and RACQ also acquired for $1.5 million the outstanding half of Autoglass, which offers repairs for members, insurance policyholders and commercial clients.\n\nThe other 50 per cent shareholder, Australian Automobile Clubs, had looked to exit its stake.\n\nMr Gillespie said it was launching its first mobile \u201cadvanced driver assistance systems\u201d recalibration service \u2013 which helps recalibrate vehicle safety systems used in windscreens. The idea was to offer simultaneous windscreen replacement and recalibration, he said.\n\nRACQ is Australia\u2019s sixth-largest mutual by membership base, according to the latest Business Council of Cooperatives and Mutuals report.", "description": "But one of Australia's biggest member-owned associations argues customer numbers have risen, while satisfaction remains high.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3309%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_88%2C$y_405/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3b017fd005dcf12d092a6eac95bcc6729864369d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
