Trump has denied he exerted \"any pressure,\" but has been accused by Democrats of trying to bolster his own re-election bid.\n\nWhile Mattis acknowledges the impeachment inquiry is \"historically significant,\" he says whistleblowing is a normal part of how power is practised.\n\n\"In the Pentagon, a whistleblower complaint can actually be a large part of creating change, and of disciplining internally the organization,\" he told The Current's interim host Laura Lynch.\n\nMattis resigned as U.S. President Donald Trump's secretary of defence over a series of policy disagreements. (Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nMattis has written a new book, Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead, which focuses not on his time in the Pentagon, but his career as a marine and a wartime commander. He has faced criticism for not speaking out about the Trump administration.\n\nBut Mattis says it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the current probe, adding his position \"is not unique to me in these very, very, I think, passionate times right now.\"\n\n\"This is a long-standing tradition at the Department of Defence \u2014 and of our military \u2014 that we don't do politics,\" he said.\n\n\"I prefer to continue that tradition, even as it frustrates those of you who want everyone to speak out right now.\"\n\nHe said that those in power should be trusted to lead without outside interference.\n\n\"The last thing I think you need to do at that point is \u2026 have the troops looking over their shoulder at the former secretary of defence, when I'm no longer responsible for the foreign policy.\"\n\nI have a lot of confidence in the hardiness of our Constitution - James Mattis\n\nAsked if he would speak up if he believed Trump was \"a danger to U.S. national security,\" he replied, \"I absolutely would.\"\n\n\"I have a lot of confidence in the hardiness of our Constitution, and in the long-term wisdom of the American people and the choices they make,\" he said.\n\n\"We're just going to have to see how it plays out. I would just say there's rough sledding ahead for everyone involved.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
