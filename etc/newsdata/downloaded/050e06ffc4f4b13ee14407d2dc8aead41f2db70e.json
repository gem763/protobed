The only two regions not to reach new peaks were Scotland and the North East of England, according to the report.\n\n\n\nDriving the increase in prices is a lack of rental inventory due to tax changes deterring new and existing landlords, Rightmove said.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, landlords faced the introduction of a 3% surcharge to the stamp duty tax for second and buy-to-let home purchases.\n\n\n\nThen in 2017, the U.K. began effectively increasing taxes on landlords by phasing out a mortgage interest deduction on buy-to-let properties. The deduction has been lowered by 25% each year since, and will be eliminated next year.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Former Mayfair Home of Aviation Tycoon Sir Frederick Handley Page Asks \u00a318.75M\n\nNationally, the number of rental properties available in the third quarter was 13% under the previous low recorded in 2015. In London, listings dropped 24% in the same time.\n\n\n\nBut despite the increasing rents, more landlords are still planning on shrinking their portfolios, Rightmove said.\n\n\n\nAlmost a quarter of landlords, 24%, are planning to sell at least one of their rental properties in the future, the report said.\n\n\n\nA cause of concern for tenants are \u201csigns that the stock shortage may worsen if some landlords follow through with their plans to sell up, though an increase in plans for build-to-rent properties may help to fill some of the gap,\u201d said Miles Shipside, commercial director and housing market analyst at Rightmove.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe overall feeling among those landlords who are planning to exit the market is one of frustration with many telling us that the tax changes mean it\u2019s no longer financially attractive to keep their properties,\u201d he said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-118178?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
