Rather, she declared, after months of unrest, the city was in a \u201cvery critical state of public danger.\u201d\n\nThe message, and the ban itself, was highly calculated. It was designed to show that the government was taking action to protect public safety while trying not to provoke more violence from protesters.\n\nThe pro-Beijing camp of government leaders and lawmakers, from moderates like Chief Executive Carrie Lam to the hard-liners, was also determined to deal with the unrest, and not give the Chinese leadership any reason to intervene.", "description": "The ban, punishable by up to a year in prison, was a measured approach.
