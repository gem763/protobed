President Trump has said he plans to ban most vaping flavors because of growing health concerns; the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Juul used influencers with large social-media followings to appeal to minors; and sales of the company's vaporizers were abruptly halted in China in September.\n\nWorries about the firm's potential merger with rival Philip Morris International Inc. have also hurt the stock. Analysts have raised questions since the two companies confirmed in late August that they were discussing potentially reuniting, with Citigroup's Adam Spielman saying in a note earlier this month that a deal might only increase the combined firm's reliance on traditional nicotine products at a time when cigarette use is declining.\n\nOne silver lining: after taking a hit, Altria's stock looks relatively cheap. It is trading at around 9.1 times its expected earnings over the next 12 months, well below its five-year average of 17 times. And shareholders can expect to reap relatively hefty dividends, too: Altria offers a dividend yield of around 8.2%, according to FactSet, around four times that of the S&P 500.\n\nNot that it is helping draw investors back in yet.\n\nThe regulatory outlook for vaping products looks riskier than initially expected, said Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Lavery in a note earlier in September. He's lowered his rating for the stock to \"neutral\" from \"overweight.\"\n\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 19, 2019 16:42 ET (20:42 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
