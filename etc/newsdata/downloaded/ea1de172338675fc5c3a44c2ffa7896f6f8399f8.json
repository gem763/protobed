But news sites often expose users to the same surveillance programs and data-collection companies they criticize . Even stories that explained how the N.S.A. was using Google cookies to \u201cpinpoint targets for hacking\u201d often included the exact same cookies revealed by Edward Snowden. Likewise, stories about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica often include Facebook tracking code, allowing Facebook to keep tabs on what people read.\n\nSurveillance on news websites is particularly problematic because the news you consume may reveal your political leanings or health interests \u2014 information that is not just exploited by corporations to sell you things, but could also be abused by governments. And because news organizations benefit from the surveillance economy by running advertisements targeted to reader interests, they may be less likely to report on their own tracking practices.\n\nA recent article on The Times, \u201cCan an Abortion Affect Your Fertility?\u201d, provides a useful example of how privacy is infringed on news websites. I used my software platform, webXray, to load the page 10 times in a row with the Chrome browser. During each page load the software kept track of data transfers made to outside companies and generated a summary of what happened.\n\nThe analysis revealed people reading the article online may be tracked by nearly 50 different companies, one of which is Oracle BlueKai. According to its website, BlueKai helps companies \u201cpersonalize\u201d marketing campaigns by ingesting \u201cmassive amounts\u201d of data. The BlueKai privacy policy specifies users are categorized into \u201chealth and wellness interest segments\u201d which include open-ended categories such as \u201cHealth Conditions\u201d and \u201cMedical Terms.\u201d Given numerous companies may track users, this is only the tip of the iceberg.", "description": "The same news organizations that do a great job of reporting on privacy problems \u2014 have privacy problems.", "authors": ["Timothy Libert"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/08/opinion/08libert-privacy/08libert-privacy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
