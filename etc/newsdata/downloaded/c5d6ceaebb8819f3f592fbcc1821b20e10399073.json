Gavin Newsom once told the nation to look out West to see what Democrats will do once they\u2019re back in power. Democrats are always in power in California, but Newsom was sad last week to announce as he prepared the 2020 budget that the boom is ending.\n\nAccording to the Sacramento Bee, Newsom told reporters, \u201cFolks, we\u2019re about to begin our descent,\u201d mimicking an airplane pilot. \u201cWe\u2019re still at 36,000 feet, but we\u2019re about to begin our descent.\u201d\n\nCalifornia boom is ending, Gavin Newsom warns as 2020 budget writing begins https://t.co/L0oXvuNmo9 \u2014 Capitol Alert (@CapitolAlert) October 3, 2019\n\nRecall is the only option. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udfff@GavinNewsom \u2014 Joseph LeDoux (@Calistlyn) October 7, 2019\n\nRecall Newsom now! \u2014 jane says (@justjanedoee) October 7, 2019\n\nCalifornia went bust 8 years ago minimum\u2026 Keep up.

There's definitely a crater, but there was no boom. \u2014 Captain Kahuna \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffd (@Captain_Kahuna) October 7, 2019\n\nBoom? \u2014 Supreme Babka (@braveunicorn55) October 7, 2019\n\nThey must mean the boom to their cronies after they swindled $2.5 billion from the federal taxpayer for imaginary choo-choos \u2014 BayAreaFrau (@bayareahausfrau) October 7, 2019\n\nRight? And the Boom they got when they forced taxpayers to absorb utility company's legal fees after causing multiple fires with their outdated equipment. \u2014 Supreme Babka (@braveunicorn55) October 7, 2019\n\nYup!

How much of the gas tax was siphoned away fr road repairs? How much was spent spent to file lawsuits against fed govt because Newsome is a moron? \u2014 Roxie Joyce (@RoxieCorleone) October 7, 2019\n\nRepeal fuel taxes. \u2014 Richard Anderson (@Richard62308363) October 7, 2019\n\nToo late, it's already been spent on global warming fight. \u2014 mzpinca (@mikhail1973) October 7, 2019\n\n\u2018Nero\u2019 Newsom busted California. Waiting for the \u201cget tough and pay more taxes\u201d speech and deal with \u201cGlobal Warming\u201d.

Its ending because it never affects the small percentage of wealthy & politically connected that overpromise & under deliver on a consistent basis. Newsom, Becerra will never own it, but it\u2019s their agenda of stealing from the average & gifting it to illegals \u2014 El Tibur\u00f3n de la Ciudad (@bay_snark) October 7, 2019\n\nHave you signed the recall petition yet? pic.twitter.com/XTTYIwNVzD \u2014 California Minority (@conserve_a) October 7, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "And Gavin Newsom can't blame the previous Democrat governor for the decline.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Newsom_FB-e1486062227673.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
