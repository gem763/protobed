Zhao noted:\n\n\u201cThere are many possible reasons for it, although none of them make much sense to me. Yes, there was a drop in the price of bitcoin, our industry\u2019s index. There was some FUD on various things (per usual). Regardless of all that, I think (in my biased view) our results out-shine them all. Yet, the price of BNB did decline. Markets often confuse people, even me sometimes.\u201d\n\nBinance burns $37M in BNB\n\nBinance has also carried out a quarterly burn of 2,061,888 BNB, worth roughly $37 million, according to a post published on Oct. 17. There are now 185,474,825 BNB remaining. The exchange says it will continue with regular burns until there are 100,000,000 BNB left.\n\nBinance Coin burn data | Source: Binance.com\n\nInterestingly, the company\u2019s profits can be calculated from the amount of burned funds, given that Binance burns 20% of its profits.\n\nFrom this data, it can be derived that Binance earned roughly $185 million in Q3 2019 \u2014 its second-best quarter ever.\n\nBinance US lists Zcash and Algorand\n\nBinance\u2019s U.S. platform meanwhile announced on Oct. 16 it will list more tokens and Bitcoin (BTC) trading pairs, all while the work on its mobile trading app continues. The first new cryptocurrencies to be listed, also announced yesterday, are privacy-focused Zcash (ZEC) and the native coin of Proof-of-Stake blockchain Algorand ALGO.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, a BNB exchange-traded product was launched on the Swiss Stock Exchange earlier this week.", "description": "After the latest Binance Coin quarterly burn and record profits, Binance CEO says that the possible reasons for BNB price decline do not make much sense", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZjc5MzhmNjJjZmMxN2JmZmFlNWY5ZTU4NDVmYzUwMWEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
