This means that to balance the budget - as is supposedly required by law in 49 states - elected officials have not included the true costs of the government in their budget calculations and have pushed costs onto future taxpayers. [\u2026] We then rank the states based on these measures.\u201d\n\nPut simply, most states in the union don\u2019t have a balanced budget, but they\u2019re required by law to balance the budget. What that means is that these states will have to raise taxes and/or cut spending in order to balance their budget. The more in debt they are, the more severe the austerity will be. In other words, while a state might seem like a good investment now, its fiscal situation might make it a relatively less attractive long-term investment than you might think.\n\nWe compared this report to the weightings we have in the domestic real estate index I work on, USREX, on the state level. The chart below shows our over/underweighting in office real estate in each state. The darker the green, the more overweight we are compared to cap-weighted.\n\n(Source: Bowyer Research)\n\nIn the 25 states with the lowest Taxpayer Burden, we are overweight in 12; and in 6, both we and the cap-weighted index of comparison are at a 0% weighting. What that means is that the cap-weighted index is underweight in the states that have the lowest Taxpayer Burden. Investing isn\u2019t just about the immediate future. Eventually, the chickens will come home to roost, and a cap-weighted approach could end up making you disproportionately exposed to the higher taxes that these states may have to enact to balance their budgets.", "description": "The latest version of Truth In Accounting\u2019s\u00a0\u201cFinancial State of States\u201d .10/25/2019 19:38:51PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Bowyer", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/289/11e8644f-8deb-4965-ac2a-09baf166bc6f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
