Webb says he doesn\u2019t recall writing a $1,000 check to State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s campaign. The Chicago Tribune reports he also says he doesn\u2019t remember attending the fundraiser thrown by his high-powered firm, Winston & Strawn.\n\nIncluded with Webb\u2019s filing was a copy of the flyer touting the fundraiser. The invitation notes lawyers in the firm including Webb, a Republican, supported Foxx, a Democrat, in her campaign for state\u2019s attorney.\n\n\u201cI should point out that it is common for Winston partners to host fundraisers for political candidates at our firm,\u201d Webb wrote to Judge Michael Toomin, who appointed the former U.S. attorney as special prosecutor in August. \u201cIt is also common that my Winston partners request that I contribute to these fundraisers.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reported that Webb was one of three attorneys listed as a \"host\" of the fundraiser.\n\nWebb said the matter was brought to his attention last week by Michael Bromwich, an attorney for Foxx.

However, it dropped all of the charges a month later with little explanation, angering city officials and the police.\n\nThen-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his city's police force after the announcement and denounced prosecutors for dropping charges and slammed the episode as a \"whitewash of justice.\"\n\nChicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson and Emanuel said they were not only furious with the outcome of Tuesday's surprise hearing but also blindsided by the decision itself, with the officials only learning Smollett wouldn't face charges for allegedly faking a hate crime at the same time the public found out.\n\nSmollett's attorneys say their client continues to vehemently deny making any false statements in the case and said he remains the victim of a crime.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "The special prosecutor appointed to look into why the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office in Chicago abruptly dropped the case against \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett allegedly staging an attack on himself acknowledged Monday that he donated to the top prosecutor\u2019s campaign and that his law firm co-hosted a 2016 fundraiser for her.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/23/694940094001_6076295931001_6076273104001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
