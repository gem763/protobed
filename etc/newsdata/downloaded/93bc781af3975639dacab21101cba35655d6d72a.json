We measured everything that we made against this. Can\u2019t beat it!\n\nThe Temptations - \"Ain\u2019t Too Proud to Beg\"\n\nThis song still sounds insane when it comes on in my car. We used as many of the stereo/room effects from this as we could get away with.\n\nBob Marley - \"Redemption Song\"\n\nI\u2019ve always been enthralled by the earnestness on this track, so we tried to emulate some of those feelings on the ballads on my record.\n\nChildish Gambino - \"Redbone\"\n\nThis song is what I imagine when I hear people say the word \u201cvibe\u201d.\n\nJames Vincent McMorrow - \"Evil\"\n\nI absolutely love the use of the choir loop on this to create the basis for the song to grow out of.\n\nJim James - \"State of the Art\"\n\nThe vocal delivery and patience on this one is so inspiring and beautiful to me.\n\nSam Cooke - \"Bring It On Home To Me\"\n\nI love songs like this that make it virtually impossible not to smile and dance along.\n\nOtis Redding - \"That\u2019s How Strong My Love Is\"\n\nI gravitate toward things that ache like this. Otis was so effortlessly intentional with how he kept you hanging on every inflection of what he sang.\n\nTLC - \"Creep\"\n\nI grew up on this music and it\u2019s hard to believe how great it still feels and sounds when I put it on now.\n\nVan Morrison - \"Tupelo Honey\"\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know what tupelo honey is to know how great the love is in this one.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/17/playlist-bear-rineharts-wilder-woods-inspirations/3786265002/", "description": "Needtobreathe frontman Bear Rinehart is celebrating the release of his debut solo album under the name Wilder Woods\u00a0and an accompanying tour.", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Published A.M.
