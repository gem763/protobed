She has been harassed in every other way yet there are no specific charges presented before the court. We don't know what she must answer to,\" Dube said.\n\nHe claimed Gumede was being targeted because of the upcoming eThekwini regional conference where she will be contesting the position of chairperson.\n\nHe believed there was a campaign to portray Gumede as someone who lived a lavish lifestyle and \"abused taxpayer's money\".\n\n\"She is an ordinary person living an ordinary life. She doesn't even own a Lamborghini. The fabrication was meant to mud her and taint her image so she appears as a person who has just abused taxpayers' money,\" he said.\n\nOn Thursday, the Asset Forfeiture Unit and Hawks swooped on Gumede and co-accused's residences and seized some of their property.\n\nThey found Gumede was not at her listed residence.\n\nThe court heard that Gumede's attorney, Bulelani Mazomba, had not followed up with the investigating officer about her change of address.\n\nMagistrate Dawn Somaroo warned Gumede: \"Make sure you do a follow up in future so that the State is aware.\"\n\nGumede and her co-accused are expected back in court in January 2020.\n\nThey are accused of colluding with corporate entities and others to circumvent the outcome of the supply chain management protocols of the municipality relating to a Durban Solid Waste tender worth more than R200m.", "description": "Former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede's supporters have rallied around her after she was found not to have deliberately violated the bail conditions of her tender corruption case.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9183/cd48ddbff51b49d79fc8f4783bbe8a11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
