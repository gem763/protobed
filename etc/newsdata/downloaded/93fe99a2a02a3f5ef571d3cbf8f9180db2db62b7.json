They ask the editorial chiefs of all main TV networks and cable news channels to desist from booking Giuliani.\n\nThe authors argue that the former New York mayor, who is deeply embroiled in the Ukraine scandal that has prompted an impeachment inquiry, is being given free rein to peddle lies and conspiracy theories.\n\nGiuliani is spreading \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump\u201d, write Anita Dunn, a former acting White House communications director under Barack Obama, and Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager.\n\n\u201cBy giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has been an almost ubiquitous feature on network and cable news shows since news broke that an anonymous whistleblower had filed a complaint alleging that Trump was trying to solicit the help of the Ukraine government in his 2020 re-election bid. Under US election law, it is illegal to seek or gain electoral benefit from any foreign entity.\n\nThough Giuliani became a figure of national unity in the wake of 9/11 as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d, he has become a symbol of the extreme partisan divide that has opened up under Trump.\n\nHis pronouncements on the Ukraine matter have grown increasingly shrill, to the point that some pundits have wondered whether he is \u201cmelting down\u201d.\n\nHe called a fellow guest on Fox News a \u201cmoron\u201d and an \u201cidiot\u201d. He denied to Chris Cuomo of CNN that he had asked Ukraine to investigate Biden, then said \u201cof course I did\u201d 30 seconds later.\n\nHe has also invoked wild conspiracy theories involving Hillary Clinton, the philanthropist George Soros and other rightwing bogey figures.\n\nBut the most consistent theme in his outlandish on-air comments has been his attempt to smear Biden, who for months has been a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in the presidential election next year.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday he repeated claims that in 2016 the then vice-president pressured Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor because he was investigating corruption in a gas company on whose board sat Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.\n\nIn fact, the investigation into the company, Burisma, was dormant by 2016. Top officials in the Ukraine government have made clear that no evidence of corruption relating to either Biden was found.\n\nIn their letter, the two Biden aides write: \u201cWe \u2026 demand that in service to the facts, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.\u201d\n\nTouching on controversy over Giuliani\u2019s actual relationship to Trump and his freelance role in US foreign policy, they also say he \u201cis not a public official, and holds no public office that would entitle him to opine on the nation\u2019s airwaves\u201d.\n\nDunn and Bedingfield also demand that if Giuliani does appear, \u201can equivalent amount of time [should be given] to a surrogate for the Biden campaign\u201d.\n\nGiuliani responded in a text to the Daily Beast.\n\nThe letter, he said, was an instance of \u201cthe usual leftwing censorship\u201d.", "description": "Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield tell executives former New York mayor is spreading \u2018false, debunked conspiracy theories\u2019", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbff562ccc7166a9944142181088540e8c37baf1/0_41_3234_1941/master/3234.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b9b57c4c9a60ec8ca1161b3fc6274f41", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
