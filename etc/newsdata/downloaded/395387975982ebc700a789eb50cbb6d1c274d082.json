While everyone has heard about the fact that plastic waste is collected and recycled, not many people know how it is done or what it takes to turn a discarded product that would otherwise end up in a landfill for the next several centuries into something useful. Here is a step-by-step guide to the entire process of plastic recycling.\n\n1. Collection\n\nThe first step in the chain is to get the plastic waste, which is discarded after use collected. In India, most of the collection process is done by ragpickers, who go from one end of the street to the other on a daily basis in search of plastic and other waste materials.\n\nAFP/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE\n\nThere are an estimated 1.5 million to 4 million rag pickers in India. In Delhi, itself has over 500,000 men and women who make a living from collecting and selling the discarded plastic. While most of them used to sell the collected plastic to scrap dealers, off late many recycling companies have begun buying it directly from the ragpickers.\n\nBCCL\n\nDon't Miss 329 SHARES 15.3 K SHARES 7.4 K SHARES 4.3 K SHARES 4 K SHARES\n\nThis is either done by vending machines or daily collections at designated collection points. Recyclers have also started collecting plastic waste directly from housing societies and RWAs by installing vending machines and collection boxes.\n\n2. Sorting and separation\n\nThis is often done at the scrap dealers end or the recyclers end, depending on the companies. This is a crucial step as not all plastic is the same. There are six common types of plastics. PS (Polystyrene) PP (Polypropylene) LDPE (Low-density polyethylene) PVC (Plasticised Polyvinyl chloride or polyvinyl chloride) HDPE (High-density polyethylene) PET (Polyethylene terephthalate).\n\nAFP/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE\n\nOut of these only PET, HDPE, and PVC plastic products are recycled by most manufacturers. So it becomes essential to be sorted before processing.\n\n3. Cleaning\n\nOnce the sorting has been done, the plastic waste needs to be washed properly to remove impurities such as labels and adhesives. This enhances the quality of the finished product.\n\n4. Shredding\n\nOnce the plastic waste is cleaned it is passed through shredding machines which will reduce the plastic materials into flakes and scraps. These flakes and scraps then become the raw material for new products.\n\nAFP/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE\n\nRecyclers either produce the scrap themselves or buy it from companies making it, depending on the nature of the firm.\n\n5. Melting\n\nThe PET scrap and flakes are then melted down in high temperatures and are either molded into everyday objects. It can also be transformed into raw material for the manufacturing of other products.", "description": "Today there is a lot of conversation around the topic of plastic waste and recycling.
