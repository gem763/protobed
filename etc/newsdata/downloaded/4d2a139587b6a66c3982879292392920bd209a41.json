It is unclear, given the private nature of the deal, who else is part of the raise.\n\nThe Gatineau, Que.-based licensed producer has seen its stock plunge 35 per cent over the past few weeks after reducing its revenue guidance for their most recently completed quarter and withdrawing its forecast for the upcoming year.\n\nHexo had previously forecast revenue of $26 million for the quarter ending July 31, 2019, but cut that assessment by 40 per cent to $14.5-$16.5 million in early October. It also withdrew its full-year 2020 projection of $400 million in revenue, attributing the move to \u201cdelayed store rollouts and price pressure.\u201d\n\nHEXO is currently in the process of turning a two-million-square-foot Sears Warehouse in Belleville, Ont., into a cannabis facility that will be used primarily to package its products. The company also has a joint venture (Truss Brewing Co.) with multinational brewing giant Molson Coors, and is aiming to introduce seven new CBD-infused beverages to the Canadian market come December.\n\nAnd an attempt to draw consumers away from the illicit market, Hexo announced last week that it would be introducing a new line of cannabis products called \u201cOriginal Stash\u201d that would be priced at $4.49 per gram, roughly equivalent to the price of a gram of weed on the black market.\n\nOne investment firm analyst, who asked not to be named, described the decision to delay the release of the company\u2019s earnings as \u201cunusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a reason to push back your earnings call. They are already reporting very close to the 90-day allotment period. All you have to do to report this raise in your financials is copy and paste the press release into a note called \u2018subsequent events\u2019,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nMichael Miller, an independent financial consultant who was formerly with cannabis company White Sheep Corp., said he did not find anything unusual about Hexo\u2019s release, except the emphasis company CEO St-Louis made on the one-year anti-dilution feature in the deal, which basically reassures shareholders that their stock will not be diluted for at least another year.\n\n\u201cCannabis retail investors are nervous about dilution because that\u2019s been a feature of this industry\u2019s equity for so long, and management is trying to reassure them on that,\u201d he said.\n\nMiller also said the postponement of the earnings call was probably just the case of management wanting to be \u201cvery prepared,\u201d given the current investor sentiment towards Canadian cannabis companies.\n\n\u201cThey were probably taking time to close this deal, and really, they don\u2019t have to file till the end of the month. I wouldn\u2019t think it was nefarious,\u201d he added.\n\nThe company is expecting the deal to close on Nov. 15.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: vsubramaniam@nationalpost.com | Twitter: VanmalaS", "description": "Hexo also announced it would push back its earnings release by four days, to Oct. 28 in light of the financing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/hexo-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
