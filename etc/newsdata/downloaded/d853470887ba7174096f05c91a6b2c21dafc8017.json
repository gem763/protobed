Goldman was an adviser of Biden\u2019s when he was in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI know that you signed the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge,\u201d the audience member asked. \u201cBut I have to ask, how can we trust you to hold these corporations and executives accountable for their crimes against humanity when we know that tomorrow you are [attending] a high-dollar fundraiser hosted by Andrew Goldman, a fossil fuel executive?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a fossil fuel executive,\u201d Biden shot back, describing himself as a candidate who has \u201cargued and pushed for us suing those executives who have engaged in pollution.\u201d\n\nPressed by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper about the fundraising event, Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m going to look at what you just told me and find out if that\u2019s accurate, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty accurate,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign pushed back at the characterization that Goldman is an \u201cexecutive\u201d of the company. Symone Sanders, a senior adviser of Biden\u2019s campaign, defended the 2020 contender in a pair of posts to Twitter, saying he hadn\u2019t violated his pledge not to take fossil fuel money.\n\nWhat @andersoncooper just said about VP Biden's fundraiser is factually incorrect. Andrew Goldman isn't a fossil fuel executive. He's not involved in the day to day operation. He's not on the board of the company, nor the board of the portfolio company. \u2014 Symone D. Sanders (@SymoneDSanders) September 5, 2019\n\nThe argument is largely one of semantics. Western LNG lists Goldman as the company co-founder on its leadership page. Goldman also co-founded De Cordova Goldman Capital Management, which invested in \u201cnatural resources and energy, media and telecommunications, and financial services.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the environmental groups that oversee the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge said the fundraiser is \u201csketchy, at best\u201d and \u201cnot good.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear. The rules of the #NoFossilFuelMoney pledge are there to help candidates stay in compliance. They are NOT there to help candidates weasel out of it,\u201d David Turnbull, a spokesman for Oil Change U.S., tweeted. \u201cThis from\n\n@JoeBiden at #ClimateTownHall feels very much like that latter. And that\u2019s...not a good look.\u201d\n\nAt the end of Biden\u2019s time slot, Cooper clarified that Goldman does not have day-to-day duties at Western LNG.\n\n\u201cWhat I was told by my staff is that he did not have any responsibility relating to the company \u2015 he was not on the board, he was not involved at all in the operation of the company at all,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf that turns out to be true then I will not in any way accept his help.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe check every single contribution,\u201d Biden added. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t list them immediately.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: This story had been updated to note that it was CNBC, not The Intercept, that first broke the story on the Thursday fundraiser in New York.
