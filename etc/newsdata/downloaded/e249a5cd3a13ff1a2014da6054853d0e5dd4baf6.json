USA TODAY\n\nDALLAS \u2013 Consider yourself warned, this might be jarring \u2013 and we don\u2019t just mean the hits delivered by Oklahoma linebacker Kenneth Murray, or taken by Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger \u2013 but here goes:\n\nThe final score from a 34-27 victory against Texas doesn\u2019t fully illustrate the Sooners\u2019 defensive dominance, or what its potential meaning. Statistics help a little: a school-record nine sacks, 15 tackles for loss, Texas with 310 total yards \u2013 but hold on, sorry, just stop.\n\nYes, that\u2019s correct: Oklahoma\u2019s defensive dominance. If it\u2019s weird to read, it\u2019s also hard to type, considering what we\u2019ve all grown used to seeing from the Sooners.\n\n\u201cThis is a new year, a completely different approach,\u201d said Murray, Oklahoma\u2019s standout junior, a playmaking catalyst who always seemed to be in Texas\u2019 way. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different mentality for this defense.\u201d\n\nOklahoma linebackers Jon-Michael Terry (40) and Kenneth Murray tackle Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger during the first half at the Cotton Bowl. (Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt\u2019s a completely different result, too \u2013 which is why these Sooners might have a higher ceiling than in recent years. Yeah, we know: They\u2019re regulars in the College Football Playoff. They also keep losing shootouts in the semifinals.\n\nBut with this defense, Oklahoma might be the complete package.\n\nThe symmetry was unavoidable. A year ago, the Cotton Bowl was the scene for Oklahoma\u2019s worst defensive performance in \u2013 well, it\u2019s hard to really say when, but in a very long time and maybe ever. Ehlinger ran and threw and the Longhorns did pretty much whatever they wanted en route to 501 yards and 48 points. The next day, Lincoln Riley fired longtime defensive coordinator Mike Stoops, brother of former coach Bob Stoops.\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 7 in college football\n\nBIG UPSET: South Carolina pulls stunner at No. 3 Georgia in two overtimes\n\nNEAR-COLLAPSE: No. 16 Michigan blows big lead before holding off Illinois\n\nContrast that with Saturday. Under new defensive coordinator Alex Grinch, Oklahoma seemed to have found some defensive answers \u2013 but the schedule had been soft; heading into Dallas, preparing for the best opponent the Sooners had faced, there were still questions.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nTexas entered the day averaging 42 points. In a shootout loss last month to LSU, the Longhorns punched out 530 yards and 38 points. But Oklahoma didn\u2019t allow a Red River shootout. Asked afterward to describe the difference in emotions, one year to the next, Murray didn\u2019t bite.\n\n\u201cNew year,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cNew identity. We\u2019ve got to keep getting better. That\u2019s the mentality. \u2026 There\u2019s a lot more out there for us.\u201d\n\nHe might just be correct. Because while Oklahoma\u2019s offense remains potent, it\u2019s not quite the machine we\u2019re used to watching put up points. But it might not need to be.\n\n\u201cRegardless of what the outside world thinks, we knew we had a lot better defense,\u201d Riley said. \u201c\u2026 The way we\u2019re playing right now, it was the difference today.\u201d\n\nIn the locker room a few moments earlier, Riley was a little more strident.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little different around here,\u201d he told the Sooners, as shown in a video posted to Twitter by the Oklahoma football account. \u201cA little different around here. And when offense was sputtering in the first half, our defense was outright dominant. Outright dominant.\u201d\n\nIt needed to be, because for a change the offense was something just short. Or at least, somewhat different.\n\nAgainst the best team Oklahoma has faced, Jalen Hurts piled up a nice statistical day (16 of 28 passing for 235 yards and three touchdowns, 131 yards rushing on 17 carries). But Hurts\u2019 two first-half turnovers cost the Sooners at least a couple of field goals \u2013 and given how the offense was humming, probably more. Instead of a blowout, Texas remained within striking distance.\n\n\u201cI definitely didn\u2019t put the team in the greatest and best situations,\u201d Hurts said, \u201cbut the key is, we found way to overcome.\u201d\n\nThey did \u2013 and it\u2019s worth noting that Hurts and the Sooners had ready responses for every Texas push. Much of that is because of the spectacular performance by junior receiver CeeDee Lamb (10 catches, 171 yards, three touchdowns).\n\nStill, while Hurts is thriving in Riley\u2019s offense, and brings a difficult dimension with his running ability, he\u2019s not the same passing threat as either of his two Sooner predecessors. A young offensive line is developing, but it\u2019s not as good as its previous iterations, either. Oklahoma rushed for 276 yards. With Hurts\u2019 skill set, the Sooners have morphed into something slightly different, yet still imposing.\n\nBut if by Oklahoma\u2019s lofty standards this offense is really good but might not be great? It might not be an issue.\n\nIn semifinals the last two years, Oklahoma\u2019s exquisite offense \u2013 led in 2017 by Heisman winner and future No. 1 overall draft pick Baker Mayfield, and in 2018 by Heisman winner and future No. 1 overall draft pick Kyler Murray \u2013 was almost unstoppable. But Oklahoma gave up 54 points in a shootout loss to Georgia and 45 in a shootout loss to Alabama, and the question was: What if they played any defense at all?\n\nWe might have gotten the answer.\n\n\u201cThey did a really good job of swarming the football,\u201d said Ehlinger, who threw for 210 yards on 38 attempts (5.5 yards per attempt) and never really got loose. He was also held to minus-9 yards rushing on 23 carries as his running threat was neutralized.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s nine sacks tied a school record (and nine sacks allowed tied a Texas school record, too). The Sooners\u2019 15 tackles for loss were the second-most they\u2019ve notched against Texas. For much of the day, the Longhorns struggled to find any kind of offensive consistency.\n\n\u201cYou saw a group of guys playing downhill, playing fast, playing aggressive,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cWhen you do that, you give yourself the chance to be successful.\u201d\n\nCredit a total makeover by Grinch, who arrived in January and said the goal was first to change the mentality. We\u2019re used to Oklahoma outscoring opponents, because it had to \u2013 its porous defense could turn any opponent into a juggernaut and any game into a shootout. But referring to the production from that powerful offense, as well as the awards it generates for its stars, Grinch insists:\n\n\u201cIf you can do it on offense, don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t do it on defense.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the defense did, stuffing Texas when the Sooners\u2019 powerful offense sparked but couldn\u2019t quite catch fire.\n\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s great,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cObviously when you fail to score and your defense picks you up, the energy just switches over to the offense. At some point, we\u2019re gonna put up points.\u201d\n\nAnd at several important points, they did. The combination added up to a very impressive win.\n\n\u201cNot a complete game,\u201d Hurts said, \u201cbut definitely another step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nOklahoma\u2019s not quite a complete team, either \u2013 but with this sudden defensive development, the Sooners have taken a huge step in the right direction.", "description": "Defense has been the Achilles heel for Oklahoma in its last two College Football Playoff appearance.
