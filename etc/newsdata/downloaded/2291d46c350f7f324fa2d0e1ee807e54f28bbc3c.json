There was more shambolic defending from Newcastle as Paul Dummett deflected Praet\u2019s shot into his own goal shortly afterwards.\n\nVardy stole in at the far post to head the fourth from Marc Albrighton\u2019s cross in the 64th minute and Wilfred Ndidi scored the fifth in the final minute of normal time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of different ways we can score. Everyone\u2019s seen obviously that we used to be really counter-attacking, but now we\u2019ve got different dimensions to our attack, and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen today with the goals,\u201d Vardy told Sky Sports.\n\nThe striker was full of praise for Pereira for his clinical finish.\n\n\u201cDelighted for him, weaker foot as well and he slotted it in the bottom corner. You\u2019ve seen what he\u2019s like, consistently good and he\u2019s only going to get better,\u201d he said.\n\nNewcastle captain Jamaal Lascelles tore into his team mates after their abject performance.\n\n\u201cTerrible from the boys. It is no one\u2019s fault but ourselves. We went a man down but after that we still had 10 on the pitch and leaking four goals is not acceptable,\u201d the central defender said.\n\n\u201cThe way we conceded the goals was terrible and it has never happened before. The boys do care and the man down was disadvantage but you can still roll your sleeves up and get into a shape where you don\u2019t concede any more... it\u2019s not good enough,\u201d he added.\n\nThe win lifts Leicester to third place on 14 points ahead of their visit to Liverpool, while Steve Bruce\u2019s side are second from bottom and will host Manchester United next.", "description": "A superb solo goal by Ricardo Pereira and a Jamie Vardy brace helped lift Leicester City to third place in the Premier League as they thrashed 10 man Newcastle United 5-0 on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435256873&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0PQ", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
