We all remember how he handled the situation with the former owner of the Clippers [Donald Sterling, who was forced to sell the team over racist comments]. It made everybody proud because it was the right thing to do,\u201d Popovich said (via MySanAntonio.com). \u201cA couple of years ago, I was walking the streets in New York City during the gay pride parade. I turned around and here comes a float, and Adam is standing on a float with a big sign in support of LGBTQ. And I felt great again, just like I did with the Clipper deal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe sports arm of Chinese broadcaster CCTV countered that \u201cany remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability do not belong to the category of free speech.\u201d Silver told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that he anticipated a financial fallout over the matter. \u201cI do know there are consequences from freedom of speech; we will have to live with those consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nPopovich, who has said that Trump \u201cbrings out the dark side of human beings for his own purpose\u201d and has called him a \u201csoulless coward,\u201d didn\u2019t mention the president by name Tuesday night, but his meaning was clear as he spoke about how Silver seemed to put free speech ahead of the economic riches that China represents as an NBA market.\n\n\u201c[Silver] came out strongly for freedom of speech. I felt great again. He\u2019s been a heck of a leader in that respect and very courageous. Then you compare it to what we\u2019ve had to live through the past three years, it\u2019s a big difference. A big gap there, leadership-wise and courage-wise,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for him to say. He said that in an environment fraught with possible economic peril. But he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. I\u2019m thrilled with what he said. The courage and leadership displayed is off the charts by comparison.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve all talked about or heard about all the talking heads have and everybody for the last three years, \u2018What kind of country do you want to be? Who are we? Where do we want to go?\u2019 Adam said something that helps you understand what direction you need to go in, rather than the cowardice of not being able to respond to something of the murder of Mr. [Jamal] Khashoggi [a Washington Post contributing columnist]. There are many, many incidents like that where leadership and courage mean nothing. It\u2019s all about personal aggrandizement. I was thrilled.\u201d\n\nRead more on the NBA from The Post:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The NBA has struggled to balance its financial interests with the country\u2019s suppression of free speech.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Zd7nlodVyA9RMkXU0HRYZ4lBq3o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HH7ZD5XH5AI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
