Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 declined 0.1% to 7,415.26. But Wall Street looked poised for gains, with the future contract for the S&P; 500 up 0.4% to 2,976.00. The future for the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4% 26,894.00.\n\nWall Street capped last week with a second straight weekly loss for the S&P; 500 Friday as worries about a potential escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China erased early gains.\n\nTechnology companies led the broad slide as investors weighed a report saying the Trump administration is considering ways to limit U.S. investments in China. Bloomberg cited unnamed people familiar with the administration\u2019s internal discussions.\n\nThe possibility that the U.S. is weighing another way of applying pressure on China dampened investors\u2019 already cautious optimism that the world\u2019s two biggest economies might make progress in upcoming negotiations.\n\nInvestors were cheered, however, by news that two gauges of Chinese factory activity improved in September.\n\nSurveys released Monday by an industry group and a business magazine both showed improvement, though the gains were small.\n\nDemand for Chinese goods has been hurt by weakening domestic and global economic growth as well as U.S. tariff hikes in a fight over trade and technology. Negotiators are due to meet soon in Washington but there has been no sign of progress toward ending the dispute.\n\nUncertainty over the long-running trade war has fueled volatility in the market and stoked worries that the impact of tariffs and other tactics employed by the countries against each other is hampering U.S. economic and corporate profit growth.\n\nIn Asia on Monday, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 index lost 0.6% to 21,755.84 and the Shanghai Composite dropped 0.9% to 2,905.19. India\u2019s Sensex declined 0.5% to 38,646.08. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng added 0.5% to 26,092.27, while Sydney\u2019s S&P; ASX 200 gave up early gains, losing 0.4% to 6,688.30. The Kospi in South Korea advanced 0.6% to 2,063.05. Shares fell in Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nHong Kong got a boost from reassuring comments by the chief executive of its monetary authority.\n\nNorman Chan Tak-lam, who is stepping down, said that despite the past several months of increasingly violent political protests, \u201cthe monetary system that means the exchange rate, the banking system and the financial system, have remained stable, and they have been continue to function normally and smoothly.\u201d\n\nBenchmark crude oil fell back, losing 30 cents to $55.61 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 50 cents on Friday to $55.91 a barrel.\n\nBrent crude oil, the international standard, also declined, shedding 33 cents to $60.71 a barrel.\n\nThe dollar slipped to 107.93 Japanese yen from 107.97 yen. The euro weakened to $1.0931 from $1.0934.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "World shares meandered on Monday after talk of limits on U.S. stock listings by Chinese companies undermined hopes for progress in trade negotiations.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Elaine Kurtenbach"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/south_korea_financial_markets_18833_c0-155-3694-2308_s1770x1032.jpg?4168cf7fb30d2bae6320c54486f8aebff976ca41", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
