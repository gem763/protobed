Former Attorney General Eric Holder, former Secretary of State John Kerry, former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio have also contemplated jumping in but are unlikely to do so at this point.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more anxiety than ever,\u201d said Brown\u2019s wife, nationally syndicated columnist Connie Schultz. \u201cWe\u2019re both getting the calls. I\u2019ve been surprised by some who\u2019ve called me.\u201d\n\nThe nervousness comes amid Democratic donors\u2019 frustration with the current array of candidates and increasing doubts that any are suitable individually as the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nFormer frontrunner Joe Biden has lost the hefty lead he enjoyed during the first months of his campaign, allowing Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren to pass him in the polls. Donors have expressed worry that even if Warren snags the Democratic nomination, she may not be the most viable candidate to challenge President Trump due to her far-left policy commitments.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden\u2019s campaign is hemorrhaging funding with only $9 million in cash on hand despite raising over $22 million since announcing his campaign in April. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who trails Warren, currently has about $34 million while Warren has $26 million.\n\nThe Trump campaign and Republican National Committee, meanwhile, have raised over $300 million and have $158 million in cash on hand for his reelection, more than any other incumbent president at this stage of campaign season.", "description": "High-dollar donors also mused whether power players like Michelle Obama or Michael Bloomberg could be convinced to throw their hat into the primary.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
