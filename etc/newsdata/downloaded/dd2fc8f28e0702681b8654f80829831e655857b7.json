As part of that effort, Attorney General William P. Barr has met overseas with foreign intelligence officials to enlist their aid in \u201cinvestigating the investigators,\u201d as the right\u2019s rallying cry goes, and dig into the president\u2019s suspicions.\n\nThe State Department, meanwhile, has been investigating the email records of as many as 130 current and former department officials who sent messages to the private email account of Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defied Congress on Tuesday by attempting to block the depositions of five department employees called to testify in the impeachment inquiry\u2026\n\nBut taken together, they illustrate the sweeping reach of Trump\u2019s power and the culture he has spawned inside the government. The president\u2019s personal concerns have become priorities of departments that traditionally have operated with some degree of political independence from the White House \u2014 and their leaders are engaging their boss\u2019s obsessions.\n\n\u201cBarr and Pompeo are stuck in the fog machine. They seem captives of the president\u2019s perverse worldview,\u201d said Timothy Naftali, a historian and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. \u201cAuthoritarian regimes have this problem all the time . . . when all government activity is the product of the id of the leader. But in a republic, that\u2019s unusual.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics A-Presidency-Of-One-Key-Federal-Agencies-Increasingly-Compelled-To-Benefit-Trump"], "top_image": ""}
