This is likely to appeal to a wider audience, including the Millennials who are less focused on \u201cthings\u201d and more interested in experiences.\n\n\"The good shopping centres are placing more emphasis on dining, entertainment, fitness, massage, healthcare and education services,\" Dive adds. \"Things that can\u2019t be easily delivered online.\u201d\n\nHugh Giddy, senior portfolio manager at Investors Mutual, says that while traditionally shopping centres were anchored with department stores and fashion apparel shops, \"these tenants are reducing space which is being taken up by medical centres and other service providers\".\n\nCinema admissions are still strong, with consumers continuing to visit shopping centres to watch movies. \"Why are people still going out to the movies? Because they don\u2019t want to only watch a movie on DVD or Netflix, [they want] a social experience,\" says Giddy.\n\n'Haves and have-nots'\n\nGiddy points out that the shopping centre sector is turning into \"the haves and the have-nots\".\n\nThe \"haves\" are the centres located in densely populated catchment areas, near transport hubs and offering a diverse range of shopping and entertainment experiences.\n\nHe quotes Vicinity Centres' Chadstone, Scentre Group's Westfield Bondi Junction, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield London and Scentre Group's Westfield Pitt Street Mall as examples of high-quality centres that have no problem filling their locations with shoppers and tenants. This provides investors with high occupancy rates and rental income certainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \"have-nots\" that should be treated with caution are typically located in regional locations with low catchment population and offer a narrow range of shops and services.\n\nThe strong shopping centres are also building residential apartments overhead to capture value from the air rights over their centres.\n\n\"Vicinity plans to build 900 apartments over the Chatswood shopping centre to capture value from the air rights,\" Dive says. \"In 2017 Vicinity also sold the air rights to a developer for $60 million over its Melbourne shopping centre, and this development should be completed by 2020.\u201d\n\nNot only are the shopping centres capturing value from selling air rights, they are also winning additional shoppers who will reside within the shopping centre complex.\n\nInvesting into retail property can be through owning individual listed property trusts such as Scentre, Vicinity and Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, or via managed funds and exchange traded funds. Unlisted property trusts are unlikely to offer access to the type of retail properties described as \"the haves\".\n\nThe risks to retail property investors include prolonged economic downturns that result in reduced consumer spending, although \u201cduring the GFC the Westfield Group held up quite well\u201d, Giddy says.\n\nContinued online competition will put pressure on the amount of bricks and mortar retail space required, but Giddy argues that consumer brands are still going to want a physical presence in the premium shopping centres as a branding opportunity.\n\nMark Draper is a financial adviser with GEM Capital Financial Advice.", "description": "Investors who don't dig beneath simplistic sector themes could be passing up high investment income from some attractively priced retail property assets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5295%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/782c8c69798f971db352ed82406dbef3fa64284b", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
