Now scientists have discovered that almost everything we thought we knew about T. rex is wrong.\n\nWATCH: The Real T. rex\n\n\u2018Lumbering\u2019 Lizard\n\nIn the movies, T. rex is often seen chasing down speeding cars in pursuit of a quick meal. We assumed that he was quick on his feet like his modern relatives, the ostrich and emu, who can reach speeds of 60km/h.\n\nBut scientists have discovered that Tristan\u2019s size and weight would have made him much less agile. John Hutchinson, a professor of Evolutionary Biomechanics at the Royal Veterinary College, found that the giant dinosaur reached speeds of 16km/h \u2014 about the jogging speed of a human. The real T. rex would have found it impossible to keep up with a speeding car.\n\nBut Tristan didn\u2019t need to run any faster. At that speed, he could easily chase down the slow-moving herbivores that it preyed upon.\n\nAll Rumble and No Roar\n\nIn Hollywood movies, T. rex\u2019s calls often sound like a roar. \u201cLarge carnivores today, most of them are mammals, and roars are the sounds they produce,\u201d says paleontologist, Julia Clarke. \u201cBut when we think about T. rex, this is an animal most closely related to birds and alligators and crocodiles, and those animals make very different kinds of sounds.\u201d\n\nTo find Tristan\u2019s real voice, Julia Clarke, along with naturalist Chris Packham, looked at some of his closest living relatives. Large reptiles like alligators and crocodiles produce deep sounds \u2014 low, ominous \u2018booms.\u2019\n\n\n\nUsing 3-D scans of T. rex\u2019s skull, the team learned that its hearing was tuned to one low-frequency sound \u2014 the call of another T. rex. To replicate Tristan\u2019s voice, they took the call of a modern Chinese alligator and lowered it to the level of T. rex\u2019s hearing. The result? An eerie deep and threatening rumble that could be \u2018felt\u2019 as well as heard.\n\n\u201cThis could be the first time for 66 million years that this sound has been heard on Earth,\u201d says Packham.\n\nThese low-frequency rumbles allowed Tristan to communicate over long distances, just like elephants and blue whales do today.\n\nMORE:\n\nScotty, Canada's T. rex\n\n\u2018Terrifying and Fancy\u2019\n\nIn the movies, T. rex is a scaly lizard, with drab colours and no patterning. But many modern-day reptiles today sport striking colours; blues, yellows and reds are used for communication. So it\u2019s likely that Tristan also had a more colourful look, maybe even a camouflage pattern, much like the tiger stripes or leopard spots of modern predators.\n\nBy analyzing T. rex\u2019s fossils, Julia Clarke found evidence of melanin, the same pigment found in human skin and the feathers of some modern birds. Like hawks and eagles today, Tristan probably had patches of brown, black and grey. Lawrence Witmer, a paleontologist at Ohio University, also found the bony ridges around Tristan's eyes. So like modern birds, Tristan\u2019s eyes may have had bright yellow or orange rims, used for communication.\n\nTristan had more in common with modern birds than just colour. New fossil evidence shows that T. rex had simple feather-like structures, or bristles, adorning its back and shoulders. These bristles may have been used to display strength and maturity to attract mates, much like a lion\u2019s mane. And for the \u2018king of the dinosaurs\u2019, a flowing mane of bristles only seems fitting.\n\nWatch The Real T. rex on The Nature of Things", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/TNOT_The_Real_T-Rex-03_%281%29.jpg"}
