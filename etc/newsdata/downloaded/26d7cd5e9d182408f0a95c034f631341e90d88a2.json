Tens of thousands of demonstrators are taking to the streets to decry new draft legislation that would impose serious limits on civil liberties.\n\n\n\nProposed changes include criminalising premarital sex, \"black magic\" and insulting the president. Parliament planned to vote on the bill in late September before its term expired, but Widodo has postponed the move in response to widespread outcry.\n\n\n\nHowever, demonstrators say the proposed legislation is only one of many grievances. They also want the government to repeal a newly passed law that weakens Indonesia's anti-corruption body, address ongoing human rights abuses in West Papua, and tackle raging forest fires around the country.\n\n\n\nPolice have responded to protests with tear gas and water cannons, killing at least two students and injuring and arresting hundreds more. Demonstrators say they are undeterred and will continue to rally to preserve the secular democracy\u2019s hard-fought reforms. But conservative Muslim supporters say the new legislation accurately reflects the changing \"character and personality of the Indonesian people and nation.\"\n\n\n\nAs protests continue, all eyes are on Widodo to see where he takes the country in the coming five years. In this episode we ask, is Indonesia moving away from democracy?\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nIndonesia protests continue as vote on sex-ban bill delayed - Bangkok Post\n\nJokowi, House call for probe after two students die following protests in Kendari \u2013 Jakarta Post\n\nIndonesia protests: Hundreds hurt in student-police clashes \u2013 Al Jazeera\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
