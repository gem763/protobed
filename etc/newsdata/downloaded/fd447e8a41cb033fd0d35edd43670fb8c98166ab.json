Then, she wrapped her arms around Guyger and murmured to her. Together, they prayed.\n\nThe two extraordinary moments would polarize, just like the case that led up to them, raising fresh questions about race in a white officer\u2019s fatal shooting of a black man.\n\nFor some, the hugs and words of understanding were testament to the power of radical compassion, often rooted in religious convictions \u2014 \u201ca spirit of forgiveness, faith and trust,\u201d as the Dallas Police Department put it in a Wednesday evening tweet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) praised Brandt Jean for a demonstration of \u201cChristian love,\u201d while District Attorney John Creuzot called the teen\u2019s address to Guyger an \u201camazing act of healing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope that the greater community, not just Dallas not just Texas, but the greater United States could gain a message from that,\u201d Creuzot said.\n\nNikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador, called the teen\u2019s hug \u201can amazing example of faith, love, and forgiveness.\u201d\n\nBut others were confused, troubled and outraged. They saw the latest feel-good episode in a long history of black people extending quick absolution to white people in the face of horrific wrongs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBlack people, when they experience injustice, there\u2019s almost an expectation that we will immediately forgive and therefore can sort of move on,\u201d Jemar Tisby, an African American historian and writer, told The Washington Post. \u201cSo I think a lot of people are reacting \u2014 that we have a right to be angry, a right to grieve, and a right to want justice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWe would be living in a very different world if many of the people who exult in black displays of forgiveness reciprocated that grace and mercy but that\u2019s not reflected at all in our criminal justice policy, and it makes you question what they really find compelling about it. \u2014 Adam Serwer\ud83c\udf5d (@AdamSerwer) October 2, 2019\n\nHow Botham Jean\u2019s brother chooses to grieve is his business. He\u2019s entitled to that. But this judge choosing to hug this woman is unacceptable. Keep in mind this convicted murderer is the same one who laughed about Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s assassination, and killing ppl on sight. https://t.co/Nu5QGOIR1K \u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) October 2, 2019\n\nThe conversation that played out on social media as clips of both Brandt Jean and Kemp\u2019s moments with Guyger went viral continued a debate familiar to those who watched or read about a similarly startling scene of mercy four years ago, when loved one after loved one of the victims of white supremacist Dylann Roof \u2014 all black parishioners at a church in Charleston, S.C. \u2014 offered prayers and forgiveness just days after Roof\u2019s deadly rampage.\n\nOn Wednesday, the congregation at the Dallas West Church of Christ, where the Jean family went to worship after the sentencing, met a video of Brandt Jean\u2019s words to Guyger with applause and tears, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAD\n\nThe responses of victims\u2019s relatives in both Dallas and Charleston were part of a long tradition in the black Christian community, Tisby said, one he thinks is rooted in everything African Americans have endured since slavery. It\u2019s an attitude he sees in Fannie Lou Hamer, the black Civil Rights activist who once said, \u201cAin\u2019t no such a thing as I can hate anybody and hope to see God\u2019s face\u201d \u2014 and an attitude he witnessed this past weekend at commemorations of a 1919 massacre of black Americans, where he said people spoke of justice but not revenge.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere has been such a long history of injustice perpetrated against black people in the United States that if we didn\u2019t forgive, we run the risk of being consumed by bitterness,\u201d Tisby said.\n\nI wrote this for @TeenVogue last year in reflection of the 2015 massacre at Emanuel AME Church. I can't help but think of this again as we witness Botham Jean's brother embrace the cop who killed Jean in cold blood because she was \"startled.\"https://t.co/Yv9sqifVe5 \u2014 Dr. Jenn M. Jackson (@JennMJack) October 2, 2019\n\nBack in 2015, others found the attitudes of the Charleston shooting victims\u2019 families hard to comprehend. In a New York Times article titled \u201cWhy I Can\u2019t Forgive Dylann Roof,\u201d writer Roxane Gay expressed wonder at the reactions and slammed a society she called overeager for the mourners\u2019 compassion.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhite people embrace narratives about forgiveness so they can pretend the world is a fairer place than it actually is, and that racism is merely a vestige of a painful past instead of this indelible part of our present,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSimilar misgivings were on display Wednesday as the Guyger case came to an end. The judge\u2019s hug for Guyger \u2014 highly unusual, many commented \u2014 provoked particular controversy as some pointed to other convicts who received no such shows of kindness.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDid Crystal Mason get a hug when she was sent to jail for voting?\u201d one critic asked on Twitter, referencing a black mother in the same state of Texas who was infamously sentenced to five years in prison for casting a ballot illegally.\n\nAD\n\nBlack people repeatedly demonstration an otherworldly beauty in the granting of grace to the undeserving. But the question remains: where is America\u2019s reciprocity? When are blk ppl, in the wrong and in the vice, granted this grace? When are *innocent* blk ppl granted this grace?! https://t.co/Ljh42eFj6I \u2014 Charles M. Blow (@CharlesMBlow) October 2, 2019\n\nTisby thought of epithets like \u201cthug\u201d thrown at black people and dehumanizing discussions of Michael Brown, the teen fatally shot by police in 2014. African Americans stereotyped as threatening or prone to crime are often denied the sort of empathy Guyger got during her sentencing, he said; others online echoed his sadness at uneven distribution of the kind of compassion Brandt Jean showed.\n\n\u201cI think black people are legitimately upset when we extend grace in the face of clear and blatant injustices but we\u2019re never extended that same grace in the public mind,\u201d Tisby said.\n\nAD\n\nGuyger has said her actions toward Botham Jean had nothing to do with race, testifying tearfully to her remorse and saying the shooting was \u201cabout being scared\u201d rather than \u201cabout hate.\u201d But a lawyer for the Jean family framed Guyger\u2019s conviction as \u201ca victory for black people in America\u201d and an affirmation that their lives matter.\n\nAD\n\nGuyger has also come under fire for offensive texts made public before her sentencing: Messages show the former officer joking about the death of Martin Luther King Jr., disparaging black colleagues and responding to a friend\u2019s warning that a dog \u201cmay be racist\u201d with the words, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m the same.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not racist but \u2026\u2019: White police officer who killed innocent black man in his home sent offensive texts\n\nThose texts were on the minds of some people dismayed at Judge Kemp\u2019s gestures to Guyger.\n\n\u201cHow Botham Jean\u2019s brother chooses to grieve is his business. He\u2019s entitled to that. But this judge choosing to hug this woman is unacceptable,\u201d tweeted Atlantic writer Jemele Hill, telling people to remember that \u201cthis convicted murderer is the same one who laughed about Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s assassination.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLegal experts had questions for Judge Kemp, too. Kenneth Williams, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, said he\u2019d never seen anything like Wednesday\u2019s interaction with Guyger in his 30 years of legal practice. It was not only rare but inappropriate, he said, since Kemp might have to weigh in on further case developments if Guyger appeals.\n\n\u201cShe has indicated an affinity or sympathy for the defendant,\u201d he said, suggesting the case might have to go to another judge.\n\nKemp did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The Post was unable to reach Brandt Jean, and an inquiry to the Jean family\u2019s lawyer was not immediately returned.\n\nAD\n\nThis part made my jaw drop. Reporters in the feed I watched said the judge gave Amber Guyger a bible. None of this has been the ending I expected after a racist killer was convicted and sentenced to prison. Those text messages.. I can't get that out of my head. pic.twitter.com/xMBO8ad9JM \u2014 Brooke Thomas (@BrookeOnAir) October 2, 2019\n\nAndra Gillespie saw grace in the Jean family\u2019s response to 26-year-old Botham Jean\u2019s killer: It was \u201ctheir way of trying to fulfill their Christian obligation to forgive her in spite of everything that happened,\u201d she said. But the political science professor at Emory University and devout Evangelical also cautioned \u2014 as she did after the Charleston church shooting \u2014 against letting forgiveness dull the urgency of injustice. Admiration for Brandt Jean\u2019s speech shouldn\u2019t distract people from deeper, troubling questions raised by Botham Jean\u2019s death, she said \u2014 questions like, \u201cwhy do people kill black people before they ask questions they might ask of other people?\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy problem is when outsiders look at that situation and they get touched by the forgiveness and then they get lulled into thinking we don\u2019t have to do anything else for that situation \u2026 we don\u2019t take the lessons from it that we should,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAs plantations talk more honestly about slavery, some visitors are pushing back\n\nIowa reporter who found a viral star\u2019s racist tweets slammed when critics find his own offensive posts\n\nThe brand label that stokes Trump\u2019s fury: \u2018Racist, racist, racist.\u2019", "description": "The two extraordinary moments would polarize just like the case that led up to them, raising fresh questions about race in a white officer\u2019s fatal shooting of a black man.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/piguM87xO0f7eMzTZJTAnh2AZp4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WJGPABXFTAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
