Let's start here.\n\n1. Considering the complaint\n\nPresident Donald Trump has denied he put pressure on Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden in a phone call at the center of a whistleblower complaint, but noted it would \"possibly have been okay if I did.\"\n\nWhen asked by reporters on Monday about what he discussed with the president of Ukraine during their July 25th conversation, Trump appeared to suggest a link between withholding $250 million in aid for Ukraine and corruption allegations: \"If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\"\n\nThe White House is considering whether to release the transcript of the call, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has given the Trump administration a Thursday deadline to hand over information related to the complaint as Democrats face renewed pressure to impeach Trump.\n\nAsked how seriously he is taking talk of impeachment, Pres. Trump says \"not at all seriously.\"\n\n\n\n\"We had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine,\" he adds, amid increasing scrutiny following whistleblower complaint. https://t.co/O5fuR2luR5 pic.twitter.com/kaCgUztNai \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 23, 2019\n\n2. US soldier arrest\n\nA U.S. soldier who allegedly plotted to attack a major news network and named Beto O'Rourke and a leftist group as potential targets has been arrested on terror charges, according to federal authorities.\n\nJarrett William Smith, 24, was charged with distributing information about explosives and weapons of mass destruction after he allegedly talked to an FBI informant in an online chat group about placing a \"vehicle full of various explosive materials\" at the network. Smith, who transferred to Fort Riley, Kansas in July, is also accused of planning to travel to Ukraine to fight with a violent far-right group, officials said.\n\n\"I think what these charges show is where the threat is moving,\" ABC News' Mike Levine tells \"Start Here\" today. \"We're seeing that in the domestic terrorism realm where... far-right Americans are going or talking about trying to join groups in places like Ukraine so that they can then bring those skills back to the U.S. to further their extremist far right views.\"\n\nO'Rourke's campaign said in a statement, \"We\u2019re grateful to the FBI for their diligence in handling this case and for their work to keep our country safe in the face of domestic terror threats.\"\n\nFBI\n\n3. Climate call to action\n\n\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\"\n\nGreta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, delivered an emotional call to action to world leaders at the United Nations, demanding they act on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nGreta Thunberg at #UNGA: \"This is all wrong\u2026 You all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!\"\n\n\n\n\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words\u2014and yet, I'm one of the lucky ones.\" https://t.co/aZqzSaWeU8 pic.twitter.com/xWXSjK8tNt \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 23, 2019\n\n\"You could hear a pin drop when Greta took the stage,\" says ABC \"Nightline\" co-anchor Juju Chang. \"She basically shamed everyone in the room.\"\n\nThe president, who is set to address the UN General Assembly today, also made a brief surprise appearance at the climate summit, later telling reporters, \"I\u2019m a big believer in clean air and clean water, and all countries should get together and do that.\"\n\nCarlo Allegri/Reuters\n\n\"Start Here,\" ABC News' flagship podcast, offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.

The actress went through a period of anguish nearly seven years ago when she was not speaking to her ex-husband, her three children stopped speaking to her, urging her to get help.\n\nMoore, 56, said, \"I lost me.\"\n\nPlay\n\n\"I think the thing, if I were to look back, I would say I blinded myself and I lost -- I lost myself,\" she explained.\n\nShe set out to reclaim her life, writing a memoir, \"Inside Out,\" that takes a candid look at her relationships, struggles from her childhood, ascent to fame amid life's pitfalls and her aims to help others who may be struggling.
