Entering the building, Officer Ernie Davis recognized that something had to be done. People were in danger.\n\nThe next day, Davis alerted fire-safety and housing inspectors at two District agencies that the building \u2014 crammed between the offices of a trash hauling company and a tax service, and illegally partitioned into a warren of low-rent bedrooms \u2014 lacked working smoke detectors or clearly marked exits.\n\n\u201cThere are too many make shift doors with locks which would make it difficult to exit in an emergency,\u201d Davis wrote in a report.\n\nThat warning could have been the beginning of a prompt response to life-threatening housing conditions. Instead, it set in motion a cascade of bureaucratic bungling, miscommunication and missed chances that culminated last month with two deaths when a fire tore through the house at 708 Kennedy Street NW.\n\nA Washington Post examination of the city\u2019s handling of the code violations at the property reveals a chain of events in which virtually every relevant regulatory mechanism of the city government appears to have failed.\n\nFire and housing inspectors never visited the home. A business license regulator went to the property but gave up when he could not get inside. Crucial pieces of Davis\u2019s message were lost because a fire department employee omitted an attachment on an email forwarded from a mobile device.\n\nInadequacies plagued the District\u2019s response even as flames began to consume the building. An emergency dispatcher took four minutes to dispatch firefighters to the home \u2014 far above the 30-to-90-second window deemed acceptable by national experts.\n\nThe Aug. 18 fire killed a 9-year-old boy, Yafet Solomon, and Fitsum Kebede, 40.\n\n\n\nYafet Solomon, 9, died after a fire an Aug. 18 in a rowhouse on Kennedy Street NW. (D.C. Public Schools)\n\nThe fatal fire has put a spotlight on the dire living conditions endured by some in the nation\u2019s capital, where high rents and home prices have driven many to the suburbs or into substandard housing in the city. Newcomers to the city, such as the Ethio\u00adpian immigrants who filled the house on Kennedy Street, may be especially at risk.\n\nBut the tragedy has also brought scrutiny to the multiple layers of bureaucracy that could have prevented the deaths, and did not. Rarely does such a clarion warning come from such an authoritative source. Yet the police officer\u2019s complaint generated no meaningful action during the five months that passed before the \u201cemergency\u201d he feared came to pass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual that this many agencies screw up on the same address,\u201d said D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), who said he plans to hold a hearing to examine the District\u2019s handling of the property. \u201cBut all that does highlight that it\u2019s important that each agency does what it\u2019s supposed to do.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have a housing code for a reason: To protect human health and safety.\u201d\n\n\n\nInvestigators at the back of the illegal rooming house after the fire. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nA search warrant affidavit filed as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into the fire states that the code violations \u201ccontributed to the deaths\u201d of Yafet and Kebede.\n\nThe owner of the property, James G. Walker, has not responded to repeated requests from The Post for comment.\n\nMayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has hired a law firm to review the city\u2019s handling of 708 Kennedy Street NW. The fire and police departments are adopting policies to ensure that dangerous building conditions are immediately addressed.\n\nErnest Chrappah, director of the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA), said he is also studying his agency\u2019s response and is examining dozens of additional cases to determine whether any were closed improperly.\n\nFour city employees \u2014 two from the fire department and two from DCRA \u2014 have been placed on administrative leave as the District investigates the case.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fire, public attention and criticism focused largely on a DCRA investigator who did not seek a search warrant to enter the Kennedy Street property \u2014 a procedure that is used when residents of a building could be in immediate danger.\n\nBut The Post\u2019s review of the case, drawing on previously undisclosed emails and other documents as well as interviews with current and former regulatory officials, reveals a broader, and more complicated, set of shortcomings.\n\nA disaster foretold\n\nDavis, a 23-year employee of the Metropolitan Police Department, is known for a meticulous style and special interest in derelict housing, police officials said. His report on 708 Kennedy Street NW stated that he was called to the property by another officer who suspected code violations and wanted to consult the veteran officer.\n\nLicensed as a pharmacy, the property was divided into cramped bedrooms on the upper floor and in the basement. Kebede\u2019s room measured 8 by 5\u00bd feet, according to search warrant affidavits filed after the fire.\n\nOne top-floor tenant paid $550 in monthly rent, according to a lease covering 2018 and 2019 that was reviewed by The Post. Median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the District is currently $1,367, according to ApartmentList.com.\n\nThe affidavits said rooms \u201chad been constructed of 2 by 4 lumber and drywall and are not consistent with proper living quarters, safety guidelines or building codes.\u201d A locked metal gate, perhaps related to the pharmacy office, also blocked access to the front door from the basement \u2014 which had a separate entrance \u2014 and the back of the ground floor. Bars that could not be opened from inside covered the windows.\n\n\u201cStrongly recommend both DCRA & DCFD Code Inspectors respond to the listed location,\u201d Davis wrote in his report, italicizing the words for emphasis. On March 22, he emailed the document as an attachment to six people \u2014 two D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services workers and four DCRA employees.\n\n\n\nA fire investigator walks out of the illegal rooming house. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Post obtained a copy of the email, which has not previously been made public, as well as two later emails among the recipients. Its subject title, \u201cSerious code violations,\u201d clearly announces its purpose. But the email itself contained ambiguities that ultimately contributed to the city\u2019s lackluster response.\n\n[Read D.C. police officer\u2019s report about dangerous conditions at rowhouse]\n\nThe body of Davis\u2019s email contained a single sentence: \u201cI also need an inspection of a dwelling residence located at 5410 14th Street NW as an illegal rooming house and No Certificate of Occupancy.\u201d That text referred to another, unrelated property with potential code violations, and was meant as a postscript to his attached incident report on 708 Kennedy Street.\n\nBut the lack of a specific reference to Kennedy Street in the body of the email would prove problematic. When one of the original recipients \u2014 John Barnes Jr., who works in the fire marshal\u2019s office \u2014 forwarded it from his mobile device to a co-worker who could act on the complaint, the attachment was not included, according to a Bowser administration official with knowledge of the communications.\n\nThe fire marshal\u2019s office did not visit the Kennedy Street property and scrutinized only 5410 14th Street NW. That address, it turned out, did not exist. The building Davis meant to flag was 5310 14th Street NW. Fire department workers closed the case when they learned the written address was bad.\n\n\u201cThere was a failing of the systems in place at the fire marshal\u2019s office,\u201d said Kevin Donahue, the District\u2019s deputy mayor for public safety and justice. Donahue said that \u201cthere was not an expectation or a standard operating procedure for verifying a handoff to close off any question about accountability\u201d in the handling of a complaint like that submitted by Davis.\n\n'Treat it like a crime scene'\n\nThe complaint would meet a similar fate at DCRA.\n\nA sprawling agency whose wide-ranging functions include dispensing business licenses and construction permits, and enforcing lifesaving building regulations, DCRA has historically been one of the least-loved domains of District government, and to many in Washington, it remains a byword for bureaucratic inertia.\n\nAfter Davis\u2019s email arrived, one of its recipients \u2014 Inez Saki-Tay, who according to city personnel records is a DCRA community outreach specialist \u2014 responded to the group that the email \u201cwas sent to Ferdinand Gamboa,\u201d whom she identified as the current \u201cduty officer.\u201d\n\nThe Post obtained a copy of the email sent by Saki-Tay, who declined to comment for this article.\n\nChrappah, the DCRA director, said a duty officer fields complaints and dispatches inspectors as necessary. He said it was not clear whether Gamboa actually opened the attached incident report from Davis. Gamboa did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDavis sent two follow-up emails to DCRA \u2014 on April 24 and May 21 \u2014 inquiring specifically about the Kennedy Street address, according to the Bowser administration official with knowledge of the case. An investigator was eventually dispatched \u2014 not to assess housing code violations but to determine whether the property needed a rental license. City officials have refused to disclose the investigator\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nFitsum Kebede, 40, died in the Aug. 18 fire. Police say the blaze started in a small room he occupied in the back of the basement. No cause has been established. (Brook Kebede)\n\nJames Delgado, a former DCRA inspector who became a minor celebrity in District government during the 1990s for his efforts to crack down on negligent landlords, said it was a mistake to dispatch a licensing specialist to assess dangerous building code violations. A housing code inspector \u2014 who would have more experience with similar cases and with the process for seeking a search warrant to enter a dangerous property \u2014 would have been the appropriate choice, he said.\n\n\u201cIf the cop comes in and says to you, \u2018I walked inside, and I saw these horrible conditions under which people are living,\u2019 and your focus is, well, let\u2019s find out if he has a license \u2014 that\u2019s a mishandling of the damn complaint,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cWhat difference does it make if you don\u2019t have a license, if these people are living in overcrowded conditions? Who gives a s--- about the license?\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cA major situation like this, this type of building, you treat it like a crime scene.\u201d\n\nThe DCRA business license investigator visited 708 Kennedy Street three times, city officials said. Unable to find anyone to let him inside, he sent a letter at the end of May to Walker, the house\u2019s owner, asking whether he was operating an unlicensed rental property. Then he closed the case.\n\nChrappah said his employees should have sought a search warrant to enter the property, rather than simply giving up after visiting. He also acknowledged that it would have been appropriate, judging by the contents of Davis\u2019s report, to dispatch a code inspector as well as a license investigator.\n\n\u201cBased on what we know now,\u201d Chrappah said, \u201cthey would have taken a very different action.\u201d\n\nA four-minute delay\n\nIf I stay in my room, I die.\n\nThat thought dominated the mind of Sara Mengiste on the morning of Sunday, Aug. 18. Mengiste, 46, had been too tired after a shift stacking boxes in a District warehouse to attend church with the three other Ethio\u00adpian immigrants who shared the top floor of 708 Kennedy Street NW. So she had stayed in her room, which was just large enough for a queen-size mattress.\n\nThen she smelled smoke seeping through the door.\n\nOpening it, she was blinded. Mengiste stumbled into the hot hallway, then down the stairs, where she fell as she scrambled toward the front door. Shouting \u2014 she would later learn they were from a police officer at the front of the house \u2014 sounded somewhere below her.\n\nShe moved toward the sound and burst into the open air. Mengiste would be briefly hospitalized for smoke inhalation and had bruised her knee when she fell on the stairs, but she was otherwise unhurt.\n\nOthers were not so fortunate.\n\nIt had taken two police officers, assisted by six bystanders, to break through the front door of the house, said Randy Griffin, commander of the 4th District police station. \u201cIt was almost impossible,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t see anything. There was nothing but thick, black smoke billowing from the dwelling. It was impossible to get in without being overtaken by the smoke. Visibility was zero.\u201d\n\n[Dangerous conditions contributed to deaths in rowhouse fire, officials say]\n\nThe officers would ordinarily have been aided in those crucial first moments by a team of firefighters. The first police call about the fire came in at 9:36 a.m., said Karima Holmes, director of the D.C. Office of Unified Communications. The reporting officer shouted \u201cfire,\u201d and provided the building\u2019s address.\n\nHowever, the dispatcher would not send a team until the officer responded to questions about what type of fire it was \u2014 answers the officer struggled to provide while trying to breach the front door of the house to save lives. The dispatcher put the shouting police officer aside to deal with an unrelated call about someone suffering chest pains, then dispatched the call at 9:40 a.m.\n\nAfter a four-minute delay, \u201ctime is not with the victims,\u201d said Brian Dale, associate director of medical and quality process for the National Academies for Emergency Dispatch. Dale said that though there is no uniform standard for dispatch deadlines, cities typically strive to dispatch emergency responders within 90 seconds of the first 911 call.\n\nDabney Hudson, president of the D.C. firefighters union Local 36, called the delay \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and said a full alarm \u2014 five engines, two trucks, an ambulance, a rescue squad and two fire chiefs \u2014 should immediately have been deployed.\n\nThe delayed fire response was first reported by FOX-5.\n\nHolmes said her agency had performed an internal review and determined that the call was handled well. She said the dispatcher\u2019s questions were important to determine what type of equipment should be sent to the scene of the fire.\n\nWhen firefighters finally arrived on scene, they pulled from the charred building Kebede and Yafet, both found unconscious inside. Investigators would later determine that the fire had started in Kebede\u2019s basement room and spread to block the sole exit in the basement. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.\n\nKebede died that day at the hospital. Yafet, who was preparing to begin a new school year at Barnard Elementary, died two days after the blaze.\n\n'I want him to come back'\n\nDistrict officials said they continue to examine what went wrong in the handling of the complaint about 708 Kennedy Street NW and to craft policies that will prevent those mistakes from being repeated.\n\nThis month, the city\u2019s fire and police chiefs, prompted by the mayor, announced new protocols for their responses to suspected code violations. The new rules require that a police officer report potential fire code violations to a supervisor, who will relay the complaint to the fire department through the District\u2019s dispatch center. A fire battalion chief will immediately go to the site to perform an inspection.\n\nThe goal, said Fire Chief Gregory M. Dean and Police Chief Peter Newsham, is to establish clear routes for complaints to prevent the kind of confusion that ensued after Davis\u2019s email about the Kennedy Street rowhouse.\n\nChrappah said his agency also expects to announce new procedures for addressing dangerous building conditions. He said his staff is investigating how Davis\u2019s email was handled and is reviewing 67 cases \u2014 dating to December 2018 \u2014 that may have been closed without sufficient action.\n\nDistrict officials have declined to identify the four government workers who have been suspended as their conduct is examined.\n\n\n\nFanaye Getaneh reacts as other women speak about fire victim Yafet Solomon, 9. The women were having lunch at Selassie Ethiopian Market on Aug. 20. Getaneh had lived at the house for seven years. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nOn the night of Aug. 30, a small crowd \u2014 many conversing softly in Amharic, one of the two principal languages of Ethiopia \u2014 gathered in front of 708 Kennedy Street NW. It was a vigil for Yafet. Dozens of lit candles glowed on the sidewalk amid pink and white flowers.\n\nKebede, who had worked in information technology in Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia, would have a later burial service. He had fallen on hard times after immigrating to the United States more than a decade ago, relatives said. He had been doing odd jobs at his church to make ends meet.\n\n[D.C. officials strengthen policies for handling code violations after fatal fire]\n\nDescribed by his teachers as \u201cone of the brightest stars\u201d at Barnard Elementary, Yafet wanted to be a lawyer and tried to help classmates make up when they had arguments. According to a GoFundMe site established to help his family, a teacher had recently run into Yafet \u201cdragging his mom around to be sure he had all his supplies for school.\u201d\n\nYafet\u2019s mother, who has not spoken to reporters since the fire, sat in a folding metal chair at the vigil, a black shawl draped over her shoulders. She lived with Yafet at the house, but when the fire broke out she was at work. The boy was alone.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s with God, okay? He\u2019s in heaven,\u201d Rahel Gizaw told her three young children as they stood in front of the house. She had met Yafet and his mother when her son attended school with him.\n\n\u201cI want him to come back,\u201d said her 7-year-old daughter, Sharon.\n\nYafet\u2019s mother stared past the candles at the facade of her former house, now empty, its windows boarded up.\n\nCity officials have repeatedly been asked, since the fire on Aug. 18, how many other places in the nation\u2019s capital are like 708 Kennedy Street NW. Places where the vulnerable, such as recent immigrants or impoverished families, have accepted unsafe living conditions out of ignorance or as a trade-off for low rent.\n\nThe answer \u2014 from the head of DCRA, the council chairman and the deputy mayor, the police and fire chiefs \u2014 has been consistent. They say they have no idea.\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nPolice officer flagged dangerous conditions at home months before fire\n\nD.C. regulators re-examining closed cases for potential code violations\n\nD.C. mayor calls for criminal investigation into fatal Kennedy Street fire\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The city faltered in handling complaints about the home where a blaze killed a 9-year-old boy and a man.", "authors": ["Peter Jamison", "Reporter Covering D.C.
