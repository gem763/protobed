Now, one year later, I am excited to celebrate the launch of another initiative of women supporting women, and communities working together for the greater good.\"\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex posted on Instagram a behind-the-scenes look at the collection, and a caption sharing her gratitude with the designers who participated.\n\n\"Thank you to the four brands who came together in supporting Smart Works on this special project -- placing purpose over profit and community over competition,\" Markle was quoted as saying in the post.\n\nWhile many of us are excited to shop pieces from the royal's highly anticipated clothing launch, you actually can create your very own capsule wardrobe -- and save lots of time and energy while at it.\n\nWhat is a capsule wardrobe?\n\n\"It's a practice of editing your wardrobe down to your favorite clothes (clothes that fit your lifestyle + body right now), remixing them regularly, and shopping less often and more intentionally,\" minimalist enthusiast and blogger Caroline Joy notes on her blog.\n\nIn 2018, \"GMA\" profiled style blogger Jessica Rice, who downsized her closet to 38 items to create her own capsule collection.\n\nThis edit to Rice's closet allowed for more peace in her household and a simplified wardrobe that encouraged her to take everything out of her closet and think about the things she really loved and would use frequently.\n\nTips for creating your own capsule collection:\n\nJoy advises on her blog to stick to three general guidelines: freeing yourself of clothes that aren't serving you, reserving your closet space for your favorite clothes, and shopping less often yet more intentionally.\n\n\"Let go of clothes that no longer fit, clothes that no longer work for your lifestyle, and items with other shortcomings. Either pass them on to someone who can use them or, if they\u2019re nostalgic or seasonal, store them,\" Joy noted.\n\nShe added: \"And make sure they fit your lifestyle, body, and the current weather/season. When a new season rolls in and the weather changes, reassess your wardrobe, pulling a few pieces into and out of storage.\"\n\nHer final tip: \"When you do shop, look for well-made, long-lasting pieces that bring you joy.\"\n\nThe benefits:\n\nExperts agree that creating a capsule collection brings a calming effect to figuring out what to wear every day. You have essential items that you love and are practical at the same time.\n\nThere's more room for your garments to breathe -- without the extra clutter.\n\nAn added bonus: A capsule wardrobe helps you to do more with less and find a signature style within that.\n\nThe cons:\n\nOne drawback capsule wardrobe curators mention is the act of letting go. You will need to carve out time to revamp your closet, and possibly make some tough decisions.\n\n\"There were a couple of items I missed -- for example, a flowy lace top that I love, but it wouldn\u2019t have been good for wearing multiple ways and a pair of light blue skinny jeans that weren\u2019t as versatile as the light blue pair I ultimately picked for the capsule,\" Rice wrote in a post on her blog.\n\n\"There were also a couple [of] casual dresses that I missed,\" the post continued. \"Other than those, all of my favorite items were in the capsule.\"\n\nNot sure where to start?\n\nIf you do a quick Pinterest or Instagram search of \"capsule wardrobes,\" you will find over 1,000 images showcasing carefully curated groups of clothing and lots of minimalist aesthetics that include as little as 10 basics that allow you to create a variety of outfits.\n\nThere are loads of inspiration to help you craft the capsule collection of your dreams.", "description": "Meghan Markle launches a capsule collection for Smart Works charity.
