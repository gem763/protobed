Should I be happy? No. Should I be worried? Yes. For these insects are intelligent and know that processed rice and wheat do not have husk and germs, and hence they have no nutrients. They are chemically processed; they look stunning but they are dead. Yes, the foodgrain that most households eat today are what are being called \u2018violent food\u2019, for they have been produced by using fertilisers that rob the soil of its nutrients and they guzzle water.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy not eat food that promotes both health and nature, Ahimsa food fits the bill. Celebrating Gandhiji\u2019s 150th birth anniversary, Navdanya, that promotes biodiversity conservation, joined hands with the India International Centre, Delhi, on October 1, to host the Ahimsa Platter dinner. Everything on the menu was not just vegetarian; several were ones that are rarely seen outside of their region, like ambadi tea, bajra khichri, bel chutney, jhangora salad and ragi halwa.\n\n\n\nMillets like ragi, jhangora and bajra and vegetables like gwar phali \u2014 cluster beans, raw papaya, and red rice do not require much water to grow and are packed with nutrients and antioxidants, which also means that they will keep you healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNavdanya director, Maya Goburdhun, who curated the platter, says, \u201cOur food is alive, meaning they are organic and organic agriculture is based on the concept of non-violent agricultural practices: non use of harmful chemical-based fertilisers and pesticides.\u201d\n\n\n\nLiving food is one that is as close to its original, natural form. It is rich in vitamins, minerals, inflammation-fighting antioxidants and phytochemicals. They help the body produce and activate enzymes necessary for hormone production and chemical reactions in the body. Foods that are rich in probiotics and prebiotics are also considered \u2018alive\u2019 as they help promote healthy bacteria in our body that are the first line of protection in the immune system.\n\n\n\nAfter taking in the elaborate spread, I started with amaranth cutlet with kothani, wood apple chutney. Amaranth, called rajgir in Hindi, is a group of more than 60 different species of grains that have been cultivated for at least 8,000 years now. These grains were once staple food in the Inca, Maya and Aztec civilisations.\n\n\n\nBetween sips of ambadi tea, I tried other appetisers like lentil dhokla, handvo and pator. The main course included gwar phali sabzi; khatta-mitha lobia; dhania paneer in khus khus and amaranth gravy; undhiyo and dal dhokli served with three varieties of rice; ragi roti and thepla. For the rice avoiders, there was bajramung dal khichri.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe wanted to showcase the diversity of food, across species and across regions. Besides paying tribute to Ba and Bapu by featuring a few Gujarati dishes, we have used items that are popular across the country. For example, ambadi, gongura leaves, are popular in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, and it\u2019s called pulichakeerai in Tamil; gwar phali is popular in Rajasthan; khus khus, also called posto, is popular in Bengali homes; sattu is a staple in Bihar and red rice is consumed widely in Kerala,\u201d says Goburdhun.\n\n\n\nWhile some dishes were mildly spicy, others had more punch to them. \u201cSpices have lots of health benefits. Each spice in the masala box has a specific function. For example, teekhapan helps you salivate. Saliva helps in digestion; in fact, the process of digestion starts in the mouth. Turmeric is recognised as a wonder medicine and is the super star of the masala box,\u201d adds Goburdhun.\n\n\n\nNot only have these traditional foods helped in treating a number of ailments, many of these plants help repair the environment, too. For example, cluster beans is a valuable plant in a crop rotation cycle, as it lives in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Vandana Shiva says, \u201cFood is not a commodity. It\u2019s the very basis of life. Also, food production is not an industrial activity. It nurtures the land and conserves resources.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, the next time you stock up provisions, do read the label. Avoid items that have additives, artificial colours and which claim to be \u2018nature like\u2019, advises Goburdhun. But how can the public, bombarded by processed food, choose wisely? Goburdhun suggests that moving to cold pressed oil instead of refined oil and using unprocessed salt would be the first worthwhile step towards eating ahimsa food. The rest will follow. \u25a0\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/749303-1350-420-5/living-versus-dead-food.img", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
