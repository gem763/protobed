It would be unacceptable for anyone.\n\n\u201cI am tough, but this has made me cry. It is hard to explain how horrible it has been.\u201d\n\nVardy, 37, said confronting Rooney had been a waste of time.\n\n\u201c(It) would be like arguing with a pigeon,\u201d said Vardy.\n\n\u201cYou can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it\u2019s still going to s*** in your hair.\n\n\u201cI said to her: \u2018Coleen, what on earth have you done?\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was not an easy phone call. She said to me: \u2018I\u2019m not pointing the finger\u2019 and I said: \u2018You have just annihilated me in public and hung me out to dry. The whole world hates me\u2019!\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought she was my friend but she completely annihilated me. She said: \u2018You know, I always really liked you, which makes it harder\u2019.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Rebekah Vardy says she has received death threats even aimed at her unborn child since Wayne Rooney\u2019s wife Coleen accused her", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/f53b0d_rebekah-vardy-receives-death-threats-leak-allegations-vardy-wife-receives-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
