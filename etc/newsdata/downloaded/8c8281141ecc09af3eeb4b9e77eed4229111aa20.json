(Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nHe woke up to the sound of an ambulance\u2019s siren, knowing that the ambulance would soon be delivering another patient to him. Ed Garner, 68, changed into medical scrubs and walked out to his truck. He dialed the hospital as he started driving toward the emergency room.\n\n\u201cAny idea what might be coming?\u201d he asked, but all anyone knew for certain was that the ambulance was still on its way out to a patient. Sometimes the paramedics were back within minutes, and other trips took nearly two hours. Sometimes they delivered Garner a patient in minor distress, and other times they brought him unresponsive victims of car crashes, heart attacks, drug overdoses or ranching accidents.\n\n\u201cDo we know anything yet?\u201d Garner asked again, a few minutes later. A stethoscope dangled from his rearview mirror. He checked his police scanner, but it was quiet. He looked toward the adjacent interstate but saw no obvious wrecks.\n\nHe lit a cigarette and rolled down the window as he drove by the dusty ranches and dry lakebeds of West Texas. He\u2019d started smoking to cope with the stress of medical school, but now he\u2019d been practicing rural family medicine for 41 years as the stresses continued to mount. He was the only working doctor left to care for three remote counties east of El Paso, an area similar in size to the entire state of Maryland, home to far-flung oil encampments, a desolate stretch of interstate, communities of drifters living off the electric grid, and highway towns made up of truck stops and budget motels. \u201cA wild place of last resort,\u201d was how Garner described parts of his territory, and for every person in every kind of medical trouble, the true last resort was him.\n\nNow his phone rang and he answered. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d he asked, and a nurse told him the ambulance was on its way back to the hospital with a truck driver who had collapsed at a gas station and couldn\u2019t move his legs.\n\n\u201cJust give me a minute,\u201d Garner said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there as quick as I can.\u201d\n\nIn the medical desert that has become rural America, nothing is more basic or more essential than access to doctors, but they are increasingly difficult to find. The federal government now designates nearly 80 percent of rural America as \u201cmedically underserved.\u201d It is home to 20 percent of the U.S. population but fewer than 10 percent of its doctors, and that ratio is worsening each year because of what health experts refer to as \u201cthe gray wave.\u201d Rural doctors are three years older than urban doctors on average, with half over 50 and more than a quarter beyond 60. Health officials predict the number of rural doctors will decline by 23 percent over the next decade as the number of urban doctors remains flat.\n\n\n\nGarner, above, and the nurses and physician assistants at Culberson Hospital serve an area of 11,000 square miles. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nIn Texas alone, 159 of the state\u2019s 254 counties have no general surgeons, 121 counties have no medical specialists, and 35 counties have no doctors at all. Thirty more counties are each forced to rely on just a single doctor, like Garner, a family physician by training who by necessity has become so much else: medical director of Culberson County. Head physician for a nearby immigration detention center. Director of a rural health clinic. Chief of staff for Culberson Hospital. And medical director for the hospital\u2019s emergency room, where the latest patient was being wheeled in as Garner introduced himself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get you something for pain,\u201d he said, putting his hand on the truck driver\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s figure out what\u2019s going on and how we can help.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like burning all the way up and down my legs,\u201d the patient said. He\u2019d been hauling a load from Florida to Central California in an 18-wheeler when he stopped in Van Horn, population 1,700, and collapsed with sudden numbness in his back and his legs.\n\n\u201cHere I am in the middle of nowhere, and I can\u2019t even move,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn a way, you got lucky it happened here,\u201d Garner said, because there was no other hospital within at least 100 miles in any direction. \u201cLet\u2019s get a CT scan and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nA radiologist came to perform the CT scan, and Garner left to make his morning rounds in the hospital and the adjacent clinic. A 91-year old was complaining of dizziness. A teenager needed a doctor\u2019s signature on his mandatory high school sports physical. A U.S. Border Patrol agent arrived from the detention center with an undocumented immigrant complaining of dehydration and nausea. On most days, Garner saw about 20 patients with the help of a nursing staff and two physician assistants. The hospital had been trying to recruit a second doctor for almost five years. A new graduate from medical school had recently committed to work in Van Horn, but he was still awaiting his final licensing.\n\nA nurse handed Garner a copy of the truck driver\u2019s CT scan, which showed two bulging discs in his back, and Garner walked in to share the diagnosis.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d learn a lot more with an MRI, but we don\u2019t have an MRI machine here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo now what?\u201d the trucker said.\n\n\u201cCould be back surgery, but you need to get some more information and talk to a neurosurgeon or an ortho.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s do it,\u201d the truck driver said. He leaned back against the bed and looked behind Garner, as if expecting a team of physicians to come in through the door. Garner followed his eyes out into the empty hallway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the best we can do is transport you to El Paso,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need a specialist, and out here, it\u2019s just me.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\n\nWest Broadway Street in downtown Van Horn, Tex. At night, the town\u2019s population surges beyond the usual 1,700 as truckers and other travelers stop to rest, and any casualties of the dark hours end up in Garner\u2019s emergency room. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nCruz Mendez visited Culberson Hospital this month with head gashes sustained in a work accident. He received 10 stitches and six staples. More-serious injuries would have meant a 120-mile trip to El Paso. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nAt home but on call, Garner eats a fast-food sandwich and watches television news while staying alert for messages from the emergency room. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nHis hospital shifts in Culberson County typically lasted 24 hours, and during the daytime he mostly did the work he\u2019d imagined for himself when he chose to become a country doctor. He greeted patients by first name and handed out fruit cups to their children. They called him \u201cDr. G\u201d and sometimes brought him homemade pies or Cheetos out of the hospital vending machine. He treated their common colds, their sunburns, their diabetes, their insect bites, their addictions, their muscle aches, and sometimes also their loneliness. \u201cMy door\u2019s always open for walk-ins,\u201d he often told patients. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in coming just to talk.\u201d\n\nIt was at night when he could feel his job turning into something more unpredictable and ominous \u2014 when he remained on call as much of the hospital\u2019s support staff emptied out and the town\u2019s population doubled because of travelers staying overnight in the roadside motels. The interstate became a sporadic trail of headlights across the desert, and Van Horn\u2019s 24-hour truck stops turned into neon islands in the darkness. The only people who sought out medical care were those who urgently required it, and all Garner could do was go home with his emergency scanner and his hospital-issued cellphone to wait.\n\n\u201cGet some rest tonight,\u201d an aide told him as he packed up to go home. \u201cHopefully it\u2019ll be nice and qui\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Garner said. \u201cNot the Q-word. I know it\u2019s silly, but I\u2019m superstitious.\u201d\n\nHe drove back to the small rental house where he\u2019d lived for most of the past eight years. He\u2019d left a busy clinic in Central Texas to take the job in Van Horn because it offered better pay, an adventure at the end of his career, and work that felt more essential, but his wife and four adult children still spent most of their time across the state, where Garner owned a small family ranch. Alone in Van Horn, he had little to do but eat a Subway sandwich, watch TV news and sit in a recliner with the cellphone on his lap. He checked the phone every few minutes to make sure he hadn\u2019t missed a call from the hospital. He got up to play his guitar. He checked the phone\u2019s ringer volume to make sure it was all the way up. He ate some more of his sandwich. He checked his phone again. He thought about all the medical emergencies that could happen in 11,000 square miles at night, which mostly meant remembering what he\u2019d seen happen before.\n\nThere were elderly inpatients at the hospital with do-not-resuscitate orders who tended to die at 3 or 4 a.m., when the body was its weakest. There were babies who stopped breathing without warning in their sleep. There were women who went into labor while passing through on the highway, and there was one woman who had arrived complaining of acute stomach pain and then needed to be told that she was several months pregnant, and then that her baby was dead.\n\nHis cellphone rang. He sat up and answered.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said, and it was his wife. \u201cYep, just sitting at home, trying to close my eyes,\u201d he told her. \u201cHaven\u2019t had anything yet.\u201d\n\nThere were migrants who arrived at the hospital in the custody of Border Patrol after spending a week or more hiking across the desert, with cactus spines embedded in their feet and spider bites on their arms. There was a teenage boy from Honduras whose major organs had shut down from dehydration, and who died despite three hours of emergency intervention. There was a Border Patrol agent who died of blunt-force trauma. There was a woman who\u2019d been fatally stabbed by her husband at 5 in the morning, and then there was her husband, who had been shot by the Van Horn police. There was a sand truck that was struck by a train, and a fuel truck that caught fire on the interstate. There were tires that blew out in the heat and tires that skidded on black ice and an unending string of single-car rollovers at the posted speed limit of 85 mph. There was a motorcyclist who flew a few hundred feet and needed more than 30 staples in his head. There was a young girl who fell out of the bed of a pickup truck and was driven over by a semi. There was a highway pileup with so many victims it required a bus to transport them all to the hospital. There was an 11-year-old with two dislocated hips that needed to be forced back into place. There were patients in a single year from 36 states and 68 Texas counties. There were dozens of people he had helped save with chest tubes, intubations and emergency blood transfusions before transferring them to the major trauma hospital in El Paso, and then there were others who went into a refrigerated room labeled \u201cBody Holding.\u201d\n\nHis phone rang again, and this time it was the immigration detention center. A woman was having an asthma attack and couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be over,\u201d Garner said. He stood up, and a minute later the detention center called again. The asthma attack had improved. The woman could wait until morning.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and he sat back down and closed his eyes. A train blared its horn, and he checked the volume on his phone. A dog barked in the yard next door. Trucks rattled by on their way to the sand mine. His phone rang again, and this time when he answered, the sun had begun to rise, and it was a hospital administrator calling to remind him about a morning meeting to review emergency response protocols. Garner got dressed and drove back into the hospital.\n\n\u201cDid you get some sleep?\u201d the administrator asked.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d Garner said.\n\n***\n\n\n\nA migrant child and her mother have been brought to Culberson Hospital by U.S. Border Patrol agents for the girl to receive the medical check now required for children detained at the border. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nDavid Cummings, left, a doctor joining the Culberson Hospital staff, discusses a patient with Garner. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the eight years he\u2019d spent in Van Horn, hospital managers had done whatever they could to extend Garner\u2019s career as one of the few country doctors left in West Texas. They\u2019d increased his pay and recruited traveling physicians to take occasional shifts in the ER so he could go back to his ranch. They\u2019d hired a full team of nurses and physician assistants to share his patient load and help in the ER. They\u2019d even lobbied the state of Texas to change its laws regulating telemedicine and then installed video cameras and fiber optic cables in the ER so that, on some nights, the only doctor on call in Van Horn was actually a doctor from out of state who appeared on a video screen.\n\nBut what they wanted most of all was a second doctor, someone who could support Garner and one day succeed him, and after a nationwide search and five years of disappointments, that second doctor was finally pulling his car up to the hospital in Van Horn. David Cummings, 43, grabbed a few boxes out of his trunk, carried them into his new office, and surveyed the empty walls.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so thrilled you\u2019re actually here,\u201d said Rick Gray, the hospital administrator. \u201cYou should start hanging up your things, put your mark on the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still waiting on my certificates and stuff,\u201d Cummings said. He had just finished his medical school residency in Nevada, and he wasn\u2019t scheduled to see patients for another few weeks. \u201cWhat should I hang up, anyway?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know this stuff. I\u2019m a rookie. \u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the doctor,\u201d Gray said. \u201cYou hang whatever you want.\u201d\n\nCummings had grown up in Central Texas as the son of an auto mechanic, and he\u2019d worked in a factory for a few years before taking out nearly $500,000 in loans to scrap his way from community college all the way through medical school in El Paso. He was the first in his family with a college degree, and he\u2019d never earned more than $50,000 a year, but in the past months he\u2019d become the focus of a nonstop medical bidding war. Fewer than 2 percent of medical school students want to practice in towns smaller than 25,000 people, according to national studies, so when Cummings accepted a rural family medicine residency in tiny Winnemucca, Nev., recruitment emails began piling up in his email inbox, sometimes as many as 20 each day.\n\n\u201cBe the STAR of a Midwest waterfront community with 252K proven income!\u201d\n\n\u201cHave a great job and a great life. Less than two hours from Tallahassee! 300K earning potential.\u201d\n\n\u201c280K in small-town Minnesota with easy commute. Two songs on the radio and you\u2019re at work!\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever dreamed of immersing yourself in the stunning panoramic views of the Alaskan Ranges and Northern Lights? 50K signing bonus and 33 paid days off each year.\u201d\n\n\u201cOzark town with nearby symphony orchestra, wineries, and museums. Ask about our 3-day work week!\u201d\n\n\n\nA freight train crosses the empty landscape of West Texas, home to Van Horn and Culberson Hospital. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat Van Horn offered was a three-year contract with $300,000 guaranteed for the first year, which was about 50 percent more than Cummings could have earned in a big city. He wanted to practice in a small town where he could get to know his patients. His wife liked the nearby mountains. They would be close enough to drive back to Central Texas to visit family. The federal government would forgive much of his student debt as a reward for his working in a medically underserved area. Van Horn had sealed the deal with a $5,000 signing bonus and a $3,000 monthly stipend during the final year of his residency.\n\nOne of the other reasons Cummings had chosen Van Horn was that there was another doctor in the office down the hall. He had never practiced without a supervising physician, and he didn\u2019t want to start his career as the area\u2019s only doctor.\n\n\u201cGot a minute, doc?\u201d he asked, as he knocked on Garner\u2019s open door and Garner motioned him in. They had met during Cummings\u2019s interview, but they had spoken only a few times in the months since.\n\n\u201cThey treating you okay?\u201d Garner asked.\n\n\u201cYou bet,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cBut I\u2019m tired of paperwork. I\u2019m ready to get started.\u201d\n\nHe said he needed to take an emergency medicine course later in the fall before he would be allowed to treat patients on his own in the ER, but in the meantime, he hoped to shadow Garner during a few overnight shifts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably have questions,\u201d Cummings said.\n\n\u201cAsk anything,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cNobody wants this to work out more than me.\u201d\n\nSo Cummings decided to ask a question that had been on his mind ever since he landed at the airport in El Paso and began driving into the empty desert and out toward Van Horn.\n\n\u201cI know you see it all out here,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cHow do you deal with being on your own?\u201d\n\n\u201cReps, experience,\u201d Garner said. He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve gotten totally comfortable with it yet.\u201d\n\nCummings thought for a moment. Even during his residency in tiny Winnemucca, population 7,400, he had worked with a medical team of emergency physicians, hospitalists and general surgeons. Once he started in Van Horn, he would eventually become the only doctor on call.\n\n\u201cSo what do you do?\u201d Cummings asked.\n\n\u201cMostly try not to think about it,\u201d Garner said. \u201cYou operate in denial. You treat one patient and move on to the next.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\n\nHomecoming queen Jadyn Corrales and others show their school\u2019s \u201ceagle claw\u201d gesture this month as the Van Horn High School band plays the school song. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nThe next: A roofer who had fallen at work and broken his foot.\n\nThe next: A mother and her 2-year-old son from El Salvador, who\u2019d spent 16 days hiking from Presidio, Tex., before being caught by Border Patrol agents near Van Horn. The mother wore tattered sandals and needed an air cast for a sprained ankle. The baby had diaper rash and insect bites on his back. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better after rest and some Benadryl,\u201d Garner told them.\n\nHe kept moving back and forth between the ER and the adjacent clinic to see patients, traveling the long hallway that encompassed the entirety of health care in Van Horn. Each appointment began with a nurse filling out one of the hospital\u2019s intake forms, which were categorized by patient symptom, 142 different versions of medical need in a small town: \u201cwheezing,\u201d \u201cseizure,\u201d \u201canimal bite,\u201d \u201cpuncture wound,\u201d \u201cfever,\u201d \u201caltered mental status,\u201d \u201cmajor burn,\u201d \u201csexual assault,\u201d \u201coverdose.\u201d Garner walked to the ER to treat a mechanic with a sinus infection. He walked to the clinic to see a truck driver for an annual physical. He walked back to the ER to evaluate a prison inmate with a potentially broken nose.\n\nOn some days, it seemed to Garner like the hallway was always getting longer, and so was the distance between Van Horn and his ranch in Central Texas. He\u2019d worn out two cars making the 400-mile commute back and forth and wrecked his small airplane in a hard landing, but still he kept coming back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to keep going at least until I\u2019m 70,\u201d Garner told his last patient of the day, a drifter who\u2019d moved from out of state after he saw a classified advertisement for cheap land in West Texas. He\u2019d spent the last several months stuck in town with no savings, worsening arthritis and breathing troubles.\n\n\u201cIf not for you, I might be gone already,\u201d he told Garner. \u201cYou should keep going until you\u2019re 80.\u201d\n\nGarner checked the patient\u2019s oxygen levels and wrote refills for his prescriptions. He noticed a growth on the patient\u2019s hand and told him it would require a follow-up appointment.\n\n\u201cI can come back tomorrow,\u201d the patient said.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be here,\u201d Garner said. He explained he had his own doctor\u2019s appointment, which required traveling more than 100 miles from Van Horn, which meant that for at least a little while a county with only one practicing doctor would have none.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Garner said. \u201cI won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d", "description": "The federal government now designates nearly 80\u00a0percent of the rural U.S. as \u2018medically underserved.\u2019", "authors": ["Eli Saslow", "Reporter On The National Desk", "September At Pm", "Eli Saslow Is A Reporter At The Washington Post.
