The Manns cross claimed for more than $391,000 for delay and alleged defects.\n\nThe Victorian Civil and Administrative Appeals Tribunal awarded Patterson $660,526. It cited authorities that said there was \"nothing anomalous in the prospect that a figure arrived at on a quantum meruit might exceed, or even far exceed, the profit which would have been made if the contract had been fully performed\".\n\nThe decision was upheld twice but the High Court backed the Mann's contention that quantum meruit claims were unfair.\n\n\"Termination for repudiation or breach is not an occasion for obtaining a windfall or inflicting a punishment,\" said the lead judgment of Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and Justices Virginia Bell and Patrick Keane.\n\nHonesty and efficiency\n\n\"It may be that some builders actually set the prices at which they bid for work on the expectation that they will be astute to take advantage of an opportunity to elect for a more generous level of remuneration in due course.\n\n\"If that is the case, any such expectation is distinctly not to be encouraged. Honesty and efficiency in trade and commerce are not promoted by a rule that allows the recovery of a windfall by a party who has extracted itself from a losing contract, from which, acting rationally, it would pay to be released.\"\n\nMr Hartmann said the availability of the \"what it's worth\" claims has been a particular concern in the construction industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The quantum meruit option created an incentive for a contractor to \u2018manufacture\u2019 a repudiation allegation to obtain a potential windfall payment, particularly where the existing contract was bid on tight margins or is loss making.\"\n\nMultitude of sins\n\nHe said allegations repudiation \"covers a multitude of sins ranging from the severe, like walking off site and refusing to perform, through to technical breaches of contract notification obligations\".\n\n\"This often led to the legal equivalent of a game of \u2018Snap\u2019 where each party accused the other of repudiation, giving the \u2018innocent\u2019 party the right to terminate - and for the contractor the opportunity to re-price its work on a quantum meruit basis.\"\n\nMr Hartmann noted that the High Court's decision came after it had twice declined to reconsider the legality of such claims since 1992.\n\n\"It resolves the uncertainty regarding whether a party which breached a contract can be found liable to pay for all works on a 'do and charge' basis, which was never the basis of upon which the original contract was awarded.\"\n\nThe Pattersons declined to comment on the basis that case was ongoing, with the court having sent the matter back to the VCAT for re-determination.", "description": "The High Court has put a stop to builders pursuing \"what it's worth\" claims when contracts are repudiated, saying the potential windfall gains do not promote \"honesty and efficiency\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_53/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/747d78e65f81ae0fd567e828805273c09624f3cd", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
