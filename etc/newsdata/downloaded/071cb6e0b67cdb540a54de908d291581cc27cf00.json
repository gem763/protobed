I don't feel like dropping any of the electives; I'm passionate about them all.\n\nYet there's one subject I do hate and long to drop. That is liberal studies. After studying this subject for a year, I've found that it overlaps Chinese and English.\n\nDo we really need liberal studies? As everybody knows, schools force us to read newspapers mainly because of this subject. As a result, we rarely have time to relax. I think it's all a little too much.\n\nJason Hung, 16, Lai King Catholic Secondary School\n\nI would definitely drop maths in school if this were not strictly forbidden. In spite of being one of the core subjects, maths is not as essential as the other subjects.\n\nLanguages are very useful because we can use them to communicate with others; science can help us know more about food and medicine.\n\nBut we never use the complex maths formulas in our daily lives. So I don't believe maths is a useful subject.\n\nOdessa Fung, 13, Diocesan Girls' School\n\nI would drop history. Originally I found it was an interesting subject.\n\nHowever, history textbooks mainly focus on \"important events\" that happened over a certain period of time. They ignore the relationship between such incidents, and the flow of historical events.\n\nI find it hard to connect the different periods of time; it's all very confusing.\n\nGiselle Chan, 18, City University of Hong Kong\n\nMathematics should be dropped completely. The things I learned in maths classes make no difference to my everyday life, but only pulled down my overall grades.\n\nI think this subject is \"poisonous\" for arts students like me. The red \"F\" on the maths column ruins our report cards, no matter how many A's we've got for languages and history.\n\nAnd, most importantly, who needs to learn maths when we can simply use a calculator?\n\nHenry Lui, 14, Sha Tin College\n\nI was able to choose most of the subjects I will take for iGCSE, but I'm not a big fan of some of the compulsory ones.\n\nAs part of our curriculum, we have a subject called \"Global Thinking Skills\", where we sit in a classroom, blabber on about things in society and take away nothing from the lesson.\n\nI definitely believe that our time should be used somewhere else.\n\nTell us if there is a subject in school you\u2019d like to drop in the comment box below.\n\nIn the next Talking Points, we\u2019ll be discussing: If you were given 20 hectares of land in the middle of Central, what would you do with it?\n\nOther conversations:\n\n- What don\u2019t we like about Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying?\n\n- If I could change one thing about myself, what would it be?\n\n- What do you think about e-learning?\n\n- How can we eliminate the problem of caged homes and subdivided flats in Hong Kong?\n\n- \"If I were gay/lesbian, I would like to tell the world ...\"\n\n- Things I wish to know in life that I never learn about in school\n\n- What I wish I could tell my parents\n\n- The school rule I would change if I were the principal\n\n- How should schools start their Monday morning assembly?", "description": "Hate it when you can't talk back?
