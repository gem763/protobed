How Rudy Giuliani's many roles for Trump could play out in impeachment inquiry", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Rudolph Giuliani, by his own admission, reached out to a foreign government to unearth damaging information about his boss\u2019 potential presidential rival \u2013 mixing roles of personal attorney and unofficial diplomat.\n\nDepending on the time of day and who he's talking to, Giuliani is an attorney advising President Donald Trump on legal matters. An unofficial envoy corresponding with foreign leaders. A cable news attack dog. A freelance investigator.\n\nNow Giuliani finds himself in a difficult position. Two associates, who tried to help him get Ukrainian officials to investigate one of Trump's political rivals, have been arrested on campaign finance charges. Prosecutors are examining Giuliani's business dealings in that country. And Democrats have accused him of violating lobbying laws by acting as an unregistered agent for a foreign government.\n\nGiuliani has said he's an attorney for Trump as well as the two men now in federal custody. But experts say he can't rely on attorney-client privilege to completely shield himself from answering questions from Congress or prosecutors.\n\nIn short, Giuliani can't have it both ways, said Josh Rosenstein, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who advises clients on foreign lobbying laws.\n\nMore: Federal investigators have been looking into Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine since early 2019\n\n\u201cEither he is admitting that he was somehow an unofficial emissary of the U.S. government operating outside legal channels and directed by the president to engage in the sort of activity at the root of the impeachment inquiry,\" Rosenstein said, \"or he was acting as an unregistered agent of foreign principals and potentially assisting them in violating campaign finance laws.\"\n\nIt\u2019s too early to gauge what Giuliani\u2019s legal exposure might be, experts say \u2013 if there is any at all. The opacity and fluidity of his relationship with the president has raised challenging questions about what Giuliani can and cannot reveal to congressional and criminal investigators.\n\nBut it's clear that Giuliani is the latest person in Trump's orbit to come under scrutiny by federal authorities. Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, once said he would take a bullet for his boss. Now he is serving three years in prison.\n\nGiuliani has cast any scrutiny as likely politically motivated and said he is not in any legal jeopardy. \"Did nothing wrong,\" he said Tuesday, hours after he defied a congressional subpoena for documents related to his dealings in Ukraine.\n\nThe president has come to Giuliani's defense, tamping down speculations that his standing might be in peril.\n\nIs Giuliani a 'foreign agent'?: Trump-Ukraine scandal puts spotlight on Rudy Giuliani's business ties.\n\nGiuliani is central figure in inquiries by Congress, prosecutors\n\nGiuliani seems to begin his days much like the president does: with a series of tweets in the wee hours of the morning, often in the same bombastic tone.\n\nHe castigates the media, attacks the impeachment inquiry, discredits the whistleblower whose allegations fueled it, pushes baseless claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and peddles the conspiracy theory that Ukraine \u2013 not Russia \u2013 interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Democrats.\n\nGiuliani, however, has been distinctly mum about the arrests last week of two of his associates, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan of funneling foreign money to American political campaigns. Two other men were charged as well.\n\nArrest made: Fourth suspect surrenders in campaign-finance case tied to Rudolph Giuliani associates\n\nProsecutors allege that Parnas and Fruman gave $5,400 to a U.S. congressman and pledged to raise another $20,000 as they sought his help in removing Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nThat congressman is former U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, who wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Yovanovitch's removal. After Parnas and Fruman were arrested, Sessions said he didn't know about the alleged scheme and would donate their contributions to charity.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani is the latest in Donald Trump's orbit to come under intense scrutiny for work he did for the president.", "authors": ["Kristine Phillips", "Dennis Wagner", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oVJ_kfrDbi7_YRQhPI4maA--~B/aD0xNzU5O3c9MzIzNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/b0cf0b42cf853cc8ff6d20b52cbd9a36", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
