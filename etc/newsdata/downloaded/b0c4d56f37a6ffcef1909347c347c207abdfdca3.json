This app violates our guidelines and local laws.\u201d", "description": "Apple said it was removing the HKmap.live app, which was criticized by Chinese state media, because Hong Kong authorities said protesters used it to attack the police.", "authors": ["Jack Nicas"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/world/10apple-1sub/10apple-1sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
