He was training with his team for the World Championships\u2014a life goal since he started practicing the sport at age 5, jumping off his bunk bed with a blanket for a parachute.\n\nThen, on April 23, 1992, Brodsky-Chenfeld lived a nightmare. Along with 22 others, he boarded a plane for a routine training jump. Two months later, he awoke from a coma to discover that a horrific plane crash\u2014one of the worst in skydiving history\u2014had crippled his body and claimed the lives of 16 of his skydiving teammates. The doctors told him that he was lucky to be alive, but he would never skydive again.\n\nIn Yali Sharon\u2019s short documentary Above All Else, Brodsky-Chenfeld describes his traumatic near-death experience, the inspiring vision he had before waking from his coma, and his miraculous recovery.\n\n\u201cThere are so many times in life that people try to tell you what your limitations are\u2014what you\u2019re capable of,\u201d Brodsky-Chenfeld says in the film. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to decide.\u201d\n\nSix months after the accident, Brodsky-Chenfeld was supposed to be recovering in the hospital. Instead, he was skydiving with his teammates, training for the World Championships. Two years later, they won.\n\nSharon told me that Brodsky-Chenfeld afforded him a new perspective on his own lifelong goals. \u201cHe is living proof of how incredible human beings can be when oriented towards a meaningful pursuit,\u201d the filmmaker said.", "description": "Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld boarded a plane for a routine training jump.
