Kennedy Jr.\u2019s previous comments that some climate skeptics should be prosecuted as war criminals, Mr. Nye replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron?\u201d Mr. Nye asked in a video interview with Climate Depot\u2019s Marc Morano. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. Was it appropriate to jail people from the cigarette industry who insisted that this addictive product was not addictive, and so on?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn these cases, for me, as a taxpayer and voter, the introduction of this extreme doubt about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen,\u201d Mr. Nye said. \u201cSo I can see where people are very concerned about this, and they\u2019re pursuing criminal investigations as well as engaging in discussions like this.\u201d\n\nMr. Nye\u2019s comments come with a coalition of liberal attorneys general pursuing companies that challenge the consensus of catastrophic climate change. Critics fear the campaign could chill research and free speech.\n\nVirgin Islands Attorney General Claude E. Walker raised concerns about a government crackdown on dissent when he issued a subpoena last week to the free market Competitive Enterprise Institute for its climate-related research and documents.\n\nAbout the potential for a \u201cchilling effect,\u201d Mr. Nye said, \u201cThat there is a chilling effect on scientists who are in extreme doubt about climate change, I think that is good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe extreme doubt about climate change people \u2014 without going too far afield here \u2014 are leaving the world worse than they found it because they are keeping us from getting to work. They are holding us back,\u201d Mr. Nye said in a post on Climate Depot, a project of the free market, nonprofit Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow.\n\nMr. Morano interviewed the star of the 1993-98 PBS television show \u201cBill Nye the Science Guy\u201d in New York in advance of the May 2 theatrical release of \u201cClimate Hustle,\u201d which takes a skeptical look at predictions of climate change disasters.\n\nThe film, along with a panel discussion, was scheduled for a screening Thursday in the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
