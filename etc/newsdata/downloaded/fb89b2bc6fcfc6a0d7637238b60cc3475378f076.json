What they're actually afraid of is paying their taxes. So in this election they'll fight harder and dirtier than ever before\".\n\n\"They'll throw everything at us because they know we're not afraid to take them on.\"\n\n\"We will invest in every nation and region, rebuild our public services and give our NHS, schools and police the money they need by taxing those at the top to properly fund services for everyone.\"\n\nBut the Conservatives' campaign chairman James Cleverly said: \"A vote for Labour is not a vote for change. It is precisely the opposite.\"\n\nHe said Labour would offer \"more delay and uncertainty on Brexit, meaning the government can't focus on people's priorities, like the NHS, schools and crime.\"\n\nMPs standing down\n\nMeanwhile, Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan became the latest MP to say they would not be standing in the forthcoming election.\n\nAnnouncing that she would not contest her Loughborough seat again, she said being an MP had had a \"clear impact\" on her family.\n\n\"The abuse for doing the job of a modern MP can only be justified if, ultimately, Parliament does what it is supposed to do - represent those who serve in all areas of public life, respect votes cast by the electorate and make decisions in the overall national interest,\" she wrote.\n\nMore than 50 incumbents are preparing to stand down - and there may be more announcements in the coming days.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jo Swinson is asked about an election leaflet describing her as the next PM.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has defended her decision to campaign as a \"candidate to be prime minister\", denying such an outcome is a fantasy.\n\nMs Swinson told the BBC's Andrew Neil the UK was in a \"very volatile political situation\" and anything could happen on 12 December.\n\n\"Plenty of people said they did not think Jeremy Corbyn would become Labour leader or Donald Trump would become US president.\n\n\"Plenty of people said they did not think Brexit would ever happen,\" she said.\n\n\"We have seen many unprecedented political results in recent years.\"\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nImage copyright PA Media", "description": "The Labour leader will kick off his campaign on Thursday with a pledge to take on \"vested interests\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17C7F/production/_109470479_corbynpamedia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
