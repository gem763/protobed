We live in Sandy Bay, we are going to see this guy in the future, and I just think it's atrocious that his dog is free to roam and attack people,' she said.\n\nA business owner who saw the vicious attack said the pair of poodles had been tied up for over an hour with no water.\n\n'It was really quite savage. The dog didn't just go once, he went a couple of times. And that's why the injury is so ugly,' she said.\n\nHobart City Council confirmed they're looking into the attack, although the dog's whereabouts is not known.", "description": "The woman was walking down a street in Sandy Bay, Tasmania, when a poodle that was tied up outside a shop lunged at her.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/03/19521386-0-image-a-24_1570674734494.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
