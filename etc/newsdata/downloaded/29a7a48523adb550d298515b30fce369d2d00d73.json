Exclusively adults only. Exclusively for over-50s.\u201d\n\nAnthony Bale (@RealMandeville) Outraged phonecall from my mother: she was shocked to receive @SagaUK brochure advertising cruises \u201cexclusively for Brits.\u201d She asked me why they would say this & if it\u2019s legal. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\n\n(Also, in terms of grammar pedantry, \u201cExclusively Adult Only\u201d + \u201cFor Over 50\u2019s\u201d is distressing) pic.twitter.com/3giXg5iybD\n\nShortly after Bale posted a photograph of the brochure, the \u201cOver 50s lifestyle\u201d section of the Saga website went offline, followed by the entire website, reappearing later during the morning. It is unclear whether the website fault was related to the promotion.\n\nSaga subsequently apologised, insisting that people of all nationalities were welcome on its tours and cruises.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely sorry for the error in the promotional leaflet that was sent to the database of one of our cruise partners,\u201d said a spokesperson.\n\n\u201cWhilst inside the leaflet it mentions our cruises depart from UK ports only, the wording that was intended to highlight this key benefit on the front cover was interpreted incorrectly and was wholly inaccurate.\n\n\u201cSaga Cruises have a proud heritage of welcoming anybody over the age of 50, of any nationality, onboard our cruises. The error has been corrected with immediate effect and we would like to apologise for any offence this may have caused.\u201d\n\nIt said cruise.co.uk had drafted the wording but admitted that Saga had signed off on it.\n\nBale\u2019s mother, Ruth Bale, 75, a retired probation officer, told the Guardian she was shocked to receive the brochure. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very sad reflection that it\u2019s seen as a marketing point, that you\u2019d want to go on a cruise exclusively composed of one nationality.\n\nSaga (@SagaUK) This is not a Saga brochure. Our partners at https://t.co/cMByEGL4cj are extremely sorry for any offence the inaccuracy in their leaflet may have caused. Saga cruises all depart from the UK but we welcome anybody, of any nationality, over the age of 50 on our cruises.\n\nChris Gardner, chief executive of cruise.co.uk, owned by private equity group Bridgepoint Development Capital, also apologised for the \u201cerror\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe wording is not a reflection of what we intended. It\u2019s a mistake that I need to get to the bottom of and who allowed those words, which I can understand are offensive.\n\n\u201cAll we can do is apologise for any offence that was caused, it doesn\u2019t reflect our company.\u201d\n\nWhile Saga came in for criticism over the content of its marketing material, shares in the company surged by more than 15% on Thursday, as profits fell by less than expected.\n\nProfits were cut in half to \u00a353m for the six months to the end of July but the company insisted that an overhaul of its insurance business was bearing fruit.\n\nBut it warned that Brexit has hurt its travel insurance business and made consumers reluctant to commit to holidays in 2020/2021 after earlier anticipating an impact only this year.", "description": "Firm says statement in brochure was an error and that all nationalities are welcome", "authors": ["Rob Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a32fbcdbb7f87acbd22e04b6afa4223e8527c3/0_406_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af83eb5b69fb54b1367762de6312bafa", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
