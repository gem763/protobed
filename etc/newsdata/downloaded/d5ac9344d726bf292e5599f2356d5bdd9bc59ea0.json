Greta Thunberg Addresses New York's Climate Strike", "language": "en", "text": "On Friday, hundreds of thousands of young people around the world took part in strikes to demand action on climate change. More than 4,500 strikes were planned worldwide in over 120 countries, and more than 500 strikes are registered in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe strike, which is organized by The Climate Strike Coalition, was intended to kick off a week events to highlight climate change.\n\nOne of the flagship protests on Friday was in New York City, three days before the U.N. Climate Summit. Tens of thousands of people turned out for the strikes with climate group 350.org estimating that as many as 300,000 attended. New York\u2019s strike was held jointly with a Puerto Rico Day of Action; Friday marks the second anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which experts estimate killed at least 2,975 people on the island.\n\nI \u2764\ufe0f NY\n\n60,000 and counting marching for change.#ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/L6ERem8Cit\n\n\u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) September 20, 2019\n\nThis is what #FridaysForFuture look like in New York City!#ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/1kTvaQh4YW \u2014 City of New York (@nycgov) September 20, 2019\n\nPeople march to demand action on the global climate crisis on September 20, 2019 in New York City. | Spencer Platt\u2014Getty Images More\n\nThe New York protest culminated in a rally featuring speeches from several prominent climate leaders, including Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who launched the global Fridays for Future \u2014 which led to the climate strike \u2014 movements last year. In August of 2018, Thunberg began protesting in front of the Swedish parliament, rather than attending school, to demand action on climate change. Her actions soon sparked a movement and led young people around the world to start to \u201cstrike\u201d from school on Fridays to demand action.\n\nTo reach the United States, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic for two weeks in a racing sailboat designed to be emissions free.\n\nLast week, the New York City Department of Education announced it would grant excused absences with parental consent of all students participating in the New York climate strike.\n\nThe estimated number in New York is over 250\u2019000!

Our house is on fire,\u201d Thunberg told the crowd. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse.\u201d \u201cWhy should we study for a future that is being taken away from us. That is being sold for profit.\u201d \u201cEverywhere I have been the situation is more or less same. The people in power, their beautiful words are the same,\u201d she said. The number of politicians and celebrities who want to take selfies with us are the same. The empty promises are the same. The lies are the same, and the inaction is the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe eyes of the world\u201d will be on the world leaders at the climate summit on Monday for the U.N. Climate Summit, she said. \u201cThey have a chance to prove that they too are united behind the science, they have a chance to take leadership, to prove they actually hear us,\u201d she said to chants.\n\n\u201cIt should not be that way. We should not be the ones who are fighting for the future, and yet here we are,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cWe demand a safe future,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that really too much to ask?\u201d\n\nEduardo Munoz Alvarez\u2014AP More", "description": "Organizers expect thousands to turn out, and 16-year-old climate activists Greta Thunberg is scheduled to speak.", "authors": ["Madeleine Carlisle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ucbgP065b1t1DZC5UmTmLA--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/3340eac27c29b3fec9cffe519ae121de", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
