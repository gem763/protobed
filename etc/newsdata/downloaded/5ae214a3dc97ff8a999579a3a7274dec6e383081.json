Effy Blue, a relationship coach in Brooklyn, works with all of the following: triads, or three people in a committed relationship together; individuals seeking to transparently date multiple lovers simultaneously; partners who each have intimate friends, all of whom are close; and clients cultivating long-term relationships with someone who already has a primary partner.\n\n\u201cThere is no single model that suits everyone,\u201d Ms. Blue said. She also wrote a book on play-party etiquette. \u201cConsent is the cornerstone of any well-produced, healthy and fun sex party,\u201d she said. \u201cThis makes it safer and more fun than an average nightclub on any given day.\u201d\n\nElla Quinlan , a 29-year-old event producer, said she knows hundreds of peers on the East and West Coasts practicing their own flavors of non-monogamy. In her own relationship with Lawrence Blume, a 55-year-old tech investor, Ms. Quinlan\u2019s goal is to enhance what is conventionally beloved about monogamy, she said.\n\n\u201cWe want to show people that it\u2019s actually possible to be in a long-term, healthy, satisfying, deeply rooted and connected emotional relationship with somebody \u2014 and do this,\u201d Mr. Blume said.\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talking, and it takes a lot of work,\u201d said Jade Marks. When Jade began exploring non-monogamy with Tourmaline , Jade\u2019s primary partner, the pair quickly realized they had different expectations: Jade wanted casual encounters, while Tourmaline preferred sustained relationships with multiple people.\n\nIt took a lengthy negotiating period. Boundaries helped: Jade and Tourmaline established safe sex guidelines, and a rule of not bringing any partners to the apartment they share, though Jade said they have \u201ca clause\u201d for unexpected encounters.", "description": "Having multiple partners can mean more pleasure, but it\u2019s not always easy.", "authors": ["Yael Malka", "Alice Hines", "Eve Lyons", "Photographs By", "Text By", "Produced By"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/04/fashion/03THELOOK1/03THELOOK1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-03"}
