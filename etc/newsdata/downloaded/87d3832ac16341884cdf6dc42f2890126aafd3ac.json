There\u2019s the $199.99 Nvidia Shield TV Pro, with a design identical to that of the previous model, and the all-new $149.99 Nvidia Shield TV. Both now feature Dolby Vision, in addition to the HDR10 and Dolby Atmos audio that were offered by the previous Shield, and they come with a redesigned remote. The other big new feature is an AI-powered upscaling system that makes 1080p content look more detailed and closer to 4K quality.\n\nI\u2019ve spent a few days testing the tube-shaped Shield TV, and I think it\u2019s going to appeal to an even wider audience than the home theater enthusiasts who\u2019ve been drawn to the Shield for its sheer horsepower and software (Android TV) that allows for plenty of tinkering. Want to load the Shield up with emulators and game ROMs? Have at it. Sideload to your heart\u2019s content.\n\nOur review of Nvidia Shield TV (2019) Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Blazing fast performance\n\nImpressive 4K upscaling\n\nBetter, more ergonomic remote Bad Stuff Doesn\u2019t do HDR for YouTube\n\nNo significant hardware improvements compared to old Shield TV\n\nNo HDR10+, Wi-Fi 6, or HDMI 2.1\n\nBoth the Shield TV Pro and Shield TV include Nvidia\u2019s Tegra X1+ chip, which is \u201cup to 25 percent faster\u201d than the older device. The Shield has always been strong when it comes to performance, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find a faster Android TV experience anywhere. This kind of speed and fluidity is rivaled only by the Apple TV 4K. Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video, and other apps open near-instantly and are buttery smooth as you scroll around for something to watch. Google Assistant responds quickly, and Android TV can now be included in routines created with the Google Home app.\n\nI\u2019ve grown rather bullish on Android TV in my time using the Shield. The home screen is nicely customizable and isn\u2019t laced with ads like a Roku or Fire TV. I like that I can scroll through recent videos from my YouTube subscriptions right on the home screen. But not many apps offer these horizontal carousels. Bizarrely, not even YouTube TV does. It\u2019d be nice to have my favorite channels right there for quick access to live TV, but nope. This lack of support for Android TV features (including picture-in-picture) from third-party developers and Google itself is disappointing.\n\nYou can Chromecast to the Shield TV, and voice commands through Google Assistant work reliably. Google is also finally improving the Play Store on Android TV for easier discoverability.\n\nAGREE TO CONTINUE: SHIELD TV Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. To use Nvidia\u2019s Shield TV Pro or Shield TV, you must agree to: Google terms of service\n\nGoogle privacy policy\n\nGoogle Play terms of service\n\nNvidia terms of service\n\nNvidia privacy policy The following agreements are optional: Location data\n\nDiagnostics Final tally: five mandatory agreements and two or more optional agreements\n\nThe Shield TV\u2019s design is certainly unconventional. You\u2019re not going to mistake this thing for an Apple TV or Roku. And at over 6 inches long, the Shield TV is by no means a streaming \u201cstick.\u201d It\u2019s not meant to hang off from your TV\u2019s HDMI port. Instead, Nvidia thinks most customers will either hide it behind the TV or even leave on the floor behind their entertainment cabinet.\n\nAt both ends of the tube are different ports: HDMI, microSD, and a remote finder button on one side, and ethernet and power on the other. The microSD slot is so close to the HDMI port that access will almost certainly be obstructed by any HDMI cable\u2019s housing, so you might have to remove the cord whenever you load up a card with new movies or other content. Still, I\u2019m glad Nvidia included expandable storage here since the Shield TV itself only has 8GB onboard.\n\nThe Shield TV Pro, which has a more traditional set top box design, has double the storage (16GB) and more RAM (3GB instead of 2GB on the Shield TV). Those numbers still strike me as low for a $200 device, however. The Pro is the only one of the two that can be used as a Plex Media Server, and you also get two USB 3.0 ports for plugging in external drives, keyboards/mice, or Samsung\u2019s SmartThings Link. I\u2019ve been reading some early feedback from disappointed customers who hoped Nvidia would get more ambitious with this hardware. Besides the ever-so-slightly-faster processor refresh (for an aging chip) and Dolby Vision, there\u2019s really not much that\u2019s new, and the Shield TV Pro lacks Wi-Fi 6 and HDMI 2.1.\n\nNeither version comes with a game controller anymore. The Shield gamepad can still be purchased separately, and Android TV also supports Sony\u2019s DualShock 4 and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One controllers. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now game streaming service comes included and is still free \u2014 for now \u2014 while in beta. Google\u2019s own Stadia service isn\u2019t expected to arrive on Android TV until sometime next year, so Nvidia doesn\u2019t have to sweat that competition just yet.\n\nThe remote that does come in the box is vastly improved. It now features buttons for power, volume, and rewind / fast forward. The voice search, home, and back buttons are still present, and at the bottom is a dedicated shortcut button for Netflix. It\u2019s the only service that gets this treatment, and Nvidia told me that\u2019s because Netflix is far and away the most popular service among its customers.\n\nAt the upper right corner of the remote is a button that you can customize to open any app (I predict Plex and Kodi will be popular choices), launch the settings menu, take a screenshot, or any number of other possibilities. The remote\u2019s buttons are backlit and activate when motion is detected. It runs off two AAA batteries and has Bluetooth (for communicating with the Shield) and IR (for controlling your TV and soundbar).\n\nThe 2019 Shields support Dolby Vision, HDR10 (not HDR10+), Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Digital Plus surround sound. So you\u2019ll find plenty of 4K HDR movies and TV shows from all the usual suspects, and the Netflix app finally outputs Atmos on Shield. But there is one disappointment: the Shield TV won\u2019t play HDR from YouTube since Nvidia hasn\u2019t gotten behind the VP9 profile (and has no plans to).\n\nFor any content that isn\u2019t in 4K, it\u2019s worth trying out Nvidia\u2019s new AI-enhanced upscaling. When done well, upscaling can make it seem like you\u2019re watching content at a higher resolution than the original source material; everything looks crisper and more detailed. But TVs and streaming gadgets tend to do a subpar job at it. Nvidia says it trained a \u201cdeep learning neural network\u201d on how best to upscale 1080p and even 720p video to 4K, and it runs that neural network in real time whenever you\u2019re playing video on the Shield TV and Shield TV Pro. Here\u2019s more from Nvidia on how it works:\n\nWe trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the residual (difference) between a regular linear scaled video and high-resolution 4K ground truth video (reference quality). After training the network with tons of video content, it gets really good at predicting the difference between the two videos. Then, when fed only the scaled video content, it can apply the prediction and produce near-4K results. Once trained, the neural network model runs in real-time on the Tegra X1+ processor and upscales video just before it is displayed on the TV.\n\nSo, is it a gimmick or does it really work? I\u2019d vote the latter. Nvidia\u2019s system makes a noticeable difference, and it\u2019s not just blanketing everything with a coat of sharpening. The AI upscaling doesn\u2019t work for 60fps video, nor does it run when you\u2019re playing games. But for everything else, you can have it optimizing the on-screen picture at all times. And I came away very impressed.\n\nYou can\u2019t watch Star Wars: The Last Jedi in 4K on Netflix, but I definitely noticed more clarity in clothing and on faces when AI-enhanced upscaling was switched on. You can set the remote\u2019s customizable button to toggle this feature on and off if you want, and there\u2019s even a \u201cdemo mode\u201d where you can drag a slider along the current frame to see the difference it makes and what part of the image it\u2019s enhancing. By default, detail enhancement is set to medium, but it can be cranked up or lowered if you find it\u2019s producing weird artifacts that aren\u2019t in the source content. I haven\u2019t really encountered that, so I\u2019ve kept the AI upscaling enabled.\n\nThe 2019 Shield TV is immediately shooting up near the top of my recommendations list for those who want a top-notch streaming experience in their living room. At $149, it still hangs onto the best elements of the pricier Shield TV Pro \u2014 speed, flexibility, and that great new remote \u2014 and leaves power user features for the power user product. There\u2019s definitely a feeling of sameness to the Pro model, and I doubt current Shield owners will be compelled to upgrade until Nvidia makes more meaningful hardware advancements. But for those new to Android TV, there\u2019s no device better at showcasing it.\n\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge", "description": "Nvidia\u2019s new $150 Shield TV is a powerful Android TV streaming device with an unconventional design, blazing fast performance, and Dolby Vision HDR.
