Brennan said that the Islamic State remains \u201cformidable\u201d and \u201cresilient,\u201d is training and attempting to deploy operatives for further attacks on the West and will rely more on guerrilla-style tactics to compensate for its territorial losses in the Middle East. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nRadio host Sebastian Gorka spotted something very unusual about former CIA Director John Brennan\u2019s twitter account today. Gorka tweeted, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t @BarackObama\u2019s chief bagman @JohnBrennan not appeared on Social Media for 9 days now?\u201d\n\nBrennan typically posts at least every day or two, usually to take a jab at Trump or one of his associates. But he\u2019s gone quiet.\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t @BarackObama\u2019s chief bagman @JohnBrennan not appeared on Social Media for 9 days now? pic.twitter.com/ljjS1hwlf4 \u2014 Sebastian Gorka DrG (@SebGorka) October 25, 2019\n\nI know what might explain it. It\u2019s been a week since NBC reported that Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham planned to expand their investigation and were said to be interested in interviewing Brennan and his colleague, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.\n\nThat had to be a blow and I\u2019ll bet social media is just about the last thing on his mind.\n\nI guess that\u2019s what happens when you interfere in a U.S. election. Then, when you don\u2019t get quite the result you were shooting for, you decide to do whatever it takes to overturn it. Not good for the soul John.\n\nOooh! I\u2019m looking back at some of his previous tweets. Most of them are directed toward President Trump.\n\nHe does include several positive comments. Actually, he praises Mitt \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d Romney for his courage and integrity! He writes, \u201cHow many other Republican Senators are ready to show the courage, integrity, & principled position of Senator Romney?\u201d\n\nHopefully none.\n\nHe concludes with, \u201cThank you, Senator, for putting our Nation & our Constitution above party politics & the corrupt behavior of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nIn another tweet, he congratulates former National Security Advisor Susan Rice on her new book and commends her for her values. Did he catch what Susan said this week about Sen. Graham? Classy lady.\n\nI bet Brennan was really rocked last night when he heard that Durham\u2019s administrative review had shifted into a criminal investigation. At least he didn\u2019t go on television to explain it all to us like his buddy, Andrew McCabe.\n\nWe may not be hearing much from Brennan in the near future. After all, finding just the right lawyer has got to be a very time consuming process. Poor Johnny.\n\nHere are some of the responses to Gorka\u2019s tweet:\n\nHe\u2019s been on his alternate account, Juan Delicioso. Check the airports! He\u2019s \u201cremaining silent.\u201d Probably on orders from his attorney. He could be busy spilling the beans on all the rest. It\u2019s over Johnny!!! He\u2019s practicing trying to get his story straight\u2026 He\u2019s booking flights for Moscow\u2026.. Nothing from either Brennen or BHO since 10/18. The silence from Obama has been deafening as well. My guess is he lawyered up.\n\nI bet it was fun playing master of the universe for awhile, wasn\u2019t it?", "description": "Sebastian Gorka Detects Something Strange about John Brennan\u2019s Twitter Account", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Nick Arama", "Kira Davis", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Brandon Morse", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ap-john-brennan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
