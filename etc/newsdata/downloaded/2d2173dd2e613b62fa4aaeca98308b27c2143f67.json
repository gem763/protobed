So, could that be the mega singer\u2019s answer to slashing fat?\n\nTo get to the belly of the workout and weight-loss trend and find out if the method really does help you slim down, I spoke to a registered dietitian and certified trainer.\n\nHere\u2019s what they have to say.\n\nWhat is fasted cardio?\n\nBasically, if you sleep for eight to 12 hours (and obviously skip foods in that time) and wake up in the morning to do an aerobic workout sans a snack, you\u2019re doing fasted cardio.\n\nIt simply involves doing a heart-pumping activity on an empty stomach. (Though you can and should have water before!) In short, the goal of training this way is to burn more fat.\n\nREAD MORE: 6 Teas That Help With Cravings When You\u2019re Struggling To Lose Weight\n\n\u201cFasted cardio is appealing to many of us who are either seeking weight loss or trying to transition our bodies to become more efficient at tapping into our fuel stores,\u201d says registered dietician Pamela Nisevich Bede, author of the upcoming Sweat.Eat.Repeat (December 2019) and owner of SwimBikeRunEat.com.\n\n\u201cAt first glance it makes sense: By training low or training on empty and without carbohydrate-based fuel in the tank, you force your system to tap into prolific fat stores in the hopes of burning fat mass and leaning out.\u201d\n\nThe catch: There\u2019s not much science to back up the claims.\n\nDoes it have science-backed benefits?\n\nWhile it\u2019s nice to think that something can slim us down quick, the research just isn\u2019t there to say 100 percent that this is the best way to burn fat and fast.\n\nA meta-analysis from 2017 found that fasted cardio hardly led to changes in body mass. However, the review only included five studies with 96 participants total, which shows just how small each study is and the lack of science even out there.\n\nAnother meta-analysis from 2018 found that eating before a workout helps people perform aerobic work for longer than in a fasted state, though skipping a snack pre-workout could potentially have some metabolic advantages.\n\nSo sure, that was something, but not necessarily the blast-fat effect people hope to achieve with fasted cardio.\n\nREAD MORE: This Injection Is The Latest Development In Weight-Loss Surgery\n\nTwo other smaller studies came out in 2018 examining exercise in the fasted state, both featuring 20 participants or less. One found that not eating pre-workout negatively affected intensity and volume of training, while still improving endurance.\n\nThe other said that fat metabolism fuels resistance training more than carbs when doing it fasted.\n\nIt\u2019s questionable whether it actually works to burn more fat\u2026\n\nOne other important note to consider is how your body uses fat, says certified strength and conditioning specialist Prof Brad Schoenfeld. (He studied fasted cardio and found little difference in body mass between those who exercise without eating and those who dine beforehand.) First, there\u2019s fat oxidation, which means actually burning fat.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s fat breakdown, where fatty acids get released from fat cells and then move throughout the body. It\u2019s questionable whether fasted cardio actually works to burn more fat, even if it does break it down. And those fatty acids that are broken down but not oxidised are just returned back to fat cells for storage, says Schoenfeld.\n\nREAD MORE: Can You Really Target Fat Loss To A Specific Area, Or Is That Total B.S.?\n\nAnother problem with the research, according to Schoenfeld: \u201cIf you just do slow cardio and you burn more fat, it\u2019s short-sighted, because you\u2019re only looking at a very small period of time \u2014 not what you would burn in 24 or 48 hours,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd because exercise (especially intense exercise) has a thermogenic effect on the body, allowing you burn more calories after you\u2019re done moving, it\u2019s unclear as to whether fasted cardio will do the same.\n\n\u201cAll evidence shows that acute burn doesn\u2019t turn into more overall fat burn,\u201d says Schoenfeld. So again, unclear as to whether fasted cardio truly will work as a fat-torching tool in the long run. The benefits of skipping snacks pre-workout could also come down to simply eating less in a day.\n\n\u201cFasted cardio is effective primarily because of calorie restriction, rather than a metabolic makeover,\u201d says Bede, who points out that it could be considered a form of intermittent fasting.\n\nAre these any drawbacks?\n\nIt\u2019s tough to say if fasted cardio could negatively affect your training or your weight \u2014 the truth is, maybe it can, especially if you\u2019re race training. \u201cIf you have a most important, long or intense, workout to crank through, it may be difficult without free energy on board,\u201d says Bede.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t compromise your overall performance because you were forced to call it quits thanks to low energy.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Running Is Your Best Bet If You\u2019re Genetically Prone To Obesity, According To This New Study\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re prone to overeating, then fasted cardio could have some downfalls. \u201cIf you finish a workout so very hungry and this leads to hangry eating of everything that\u2019s not nailed down, you should think twice before training on empty,\u201d says Bede.\n\nWhen you do finish a fasted session, you want to grab something for recovery within 30 to 60 minutes of working out. Opt for a post-cardio meal of 15 to 30 grams of high-quality protein, like lean meats, nuts or beans. And consume whole grains, fruits and veggies for a carb re-stock, says Bede.\n\nHow do I know if I should try it?\n\nIf you\u2019re doing fasted cardio for long-term aesthetic reasons, you probably won\u2019t get the benefits you\u2019re seeking, says Schoenfeld. But if you want to try it out, go for it.\n\nDo know that it might take you a few times to get used to exercising on empty. Your body will eventually adapt, but you could feel kind of crappy during those first few sessions, according to both experts.\n\nAlso, if after a few sessions it\u2019s still zapping your energy or you just don\u2019t feel great doing it, then don\u2019t.\n\nREAD MORE: 3 Practical Habit Changes That\u2019ll Help You Lose Weight\n\n\u201cUltimately, preference is the most important,\u201d says Schoenfeld. \u201cIf you wake up fasted and it\u2019s not offering you any benefit and you hate it, do you really want to keep doing that? Instead, do what you like.\u201d\n\nFinally, consider your goals. \u201cIf you want to perform, go long and log a seriously hard workout, you need fuel to improve performance,\u201d says Bede.\n\n\u201cIf your goal is to lean out and log maintenance miles or burn off calories, most of us can probably crank through a workout with the fuel stores we have on board.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Starting with: What is it?", "authors": ["Mallory Creveling"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2337/b132dd8a39d24a25b0a89a3ed27a42f4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
