The protests organized by Extinction Rebellion, an international advocacy group founded last year in a small English town, launched what the organization says will be series of events in more than 60 countries across the world.\n\n\"There is no Plan(et) B. The government doesn't have one,\" the group said in a statement delineating the various nonviolent protests they called for on Monday. \"The things we trust in life that we don't even know we trust, they're all incredibly fragile. Extreme weather will tell this truth for us unless the Government does it for us first.\"\n\nIn London, where protesters, many clad in white makeup and red costumes, sought to clog the busy roads around Trafalgar Square and government buildings elsewhere, police said they had already made 276 arrests by Monday evening local time. The throngs of demonstrators disrupted traffic and lofted signs sporting Extinction Rebellion's logo, a simple hourglass set in a circle.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"Parliament declared a climate and environment emergency in April and we've seen absolutely nothing since. So we're here again, and we're going to stay here until they actually do something,\" Sophie Cowen, an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson, explained to CBS News.\n\nMeanwhile in Amsterdam, where protesters gathered outside the Rijksmuseum, national museum of the Netherlands, police said Monday Monday evening that they removed around 270 people under an emergency order from the city's mayor. Officials say they have arrested about 90 of the protesters, some of whom have already been set free with fines.\n\nAnd in Berlin, protesters set up a small sea of tents outside the German chancellery building \u2014 and found themselves arrested in droves, as well.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nOn Wall Street in New York City, protesters held a mock funeral march and splashed the Charging Bull, the huge bronze tourist attraction, with a coat of red paint resembling blood. Above the scene, a protester stood atop the bull waving a flag with the group's emblem.\n\nMany of the demonstrators who splayed out at its hooves, like so many gored victims, also were taken away by police.\n\nDemonstrations \u2014 and in some cases, arrests \u2014 have been reported in Sydney, Paris, Madrid, Vienna, among other cities.\n\nThe protests, which are expected to last about two weeks, mark a revival of the unrest that erupted earlier this year, when Extinction Rebellion led protests in London that resulted in days of traffic disruption and more than 1,000 arrests.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Christophe Gateau/dpa/AFP via Getty Images Christophe Gateau/dpa/AFP via Getty Images\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Oscar Del Pozo/AFP via Getty Images Oscar Del Pozo/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe protests have an urgency derived from decades of scientific studies and a spate of recent research about the accelerating effects of climate change, including warming oceans, plummeting biodiversity and the looming risks of extinction for more than 12 percent of the world's plant and animal species.\n\nAt the United Nations' Climate Action Summit in New York City last month, teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg grabbed headlines with her challenge to world leaders.\n\n\"You all come to us young people for hope,\" she said at the time. \"How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, and yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.\"\n\n\"The situation is extreme,\" Extinction Rebellion member Katerina Hasapopoulos recently told Joanna Kakissis for NPR, \"and we need to match that with extreme tactics. I actually don't think we are extreme enough.\"\n\nThe group says it has three principal demands in the U.K. in particular: the declaration of a \"climate and ecological emergency,\" the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.K. to net zero by 2025, and the creation of a \"citizen's assembly\" to steer the country's climate policy.", "description": "Hundreds of protesters were arrested in London, Amsterdam and New York, among other cities. \"Extreme weather will tell this truth for us unless the Government does it for us first,\" organizers said.", "authors": ["Colin Dwyer"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/07/ap_19280477510467_wide-4a73f5557a705b2abb5f6f77d7678b439ff1962d.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
