Photo: NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nBilly Joel\u2019s music is getting turned into a TV show, which can only be good news for the popularity of piano bars everywhere. According to The Hollywood Reporter, MGM Television is working with Universal Music Publishing Group to create a scripted series called Scenes From an Italian Restaurant, which they are baptizing with the frankly demonic portmanteau of an \u201carc-thology series.\u201d The premise is apparently that each episode will be based on a different song in Joel\u2019s catalogue, with \u201creimagined and rearranged\u201d versions of those songs performed within them. The series would have access to Joel\u2019s complete catalogue, meaning we could see some of his lesser-known work as well. The use of \u201carc\u201d implies that the episodes will all link together somehow, unlike a traditional anthology series, though THR doesn\u2019t elaborate. Maybe the Piano Man and the Stranger and Mamma Leone all go to the same Italian restaurant! Ta-da, you\u2019ve got yourself a show.", "description": "Universal Music Publishing Group and MGM Television are developing Billy Joel\u2019s music into a scripted \u201carc-thology\u201d series called Scenes From an Italian Restaurant.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/25/25-billy-joel.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
