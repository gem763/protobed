Anyway.. 6-0 and we go back home, at least we did our job. Safe travel to our fans, u (sic) guys did well'.\n\nThe 24-year-old wasn't done there as he also took aim at Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov for saying England have a bigger racism problem than his own country.\n\nBefore the game, Balakov incredibly said that he believed there was no problem with racism in his country.\n\n'What I can say is that I don't think we have a problem,' he said.\n\nBulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov had said that English football has a bigger racism problem\n\nSterling took aim at Balakov who said England had a bigger racism problem than Bulgaria\n\nJesse Lingard tweeted a black and white Three Lions crest, calling it a 'shameful' night\n\n'In the Bulgarian championship, we have a lot of players of different ethnicities and skin colour. I don't think that we have this big problem like, for example, England do.'\n\nHowever, the game was called to a halt twice for racist abuse directed at Sterling, Tyrone Mings and Marcus Rashford from sections of the home support, with there a real possibility that the Euro 2020 qualifier would be called off.\n\nImages of fans making Nazi salutes were also broadcasted during the game before the group left the stadium before the half-time whistle.\n\nAsked to clarify his remark on England, Balakov said: 'What I meant was that in the Bulgarian championship we've not had such problems.\n\nA fan holds up a No Respect jumper, rubbishing UEFA's campaign to end to racism in football\n\nBulgaria coach denies abuse Bulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov insists he did not hear any racist chanting from his nation's supporters and slammed England fans for interrupting the Bulgaria national anthem. This is despite monkey noises aimed at England forward Raheem Sterling being clearly heard at the ground and on television. Balakov told ITV: 'I personally did not hear the chanting you are most probably referring to. I saw that the referee stopped the game. 'But I also have to say the unacceptable behaviour was not only on behalf of the Bulgaria fans but also the England fans who were whistling and shouting during the Bulgaria national anthem and during the second half they used words against our fans which I find unacceptable.'\n\n'While there have been incidents in various levels of English football involving racism, which I consider something normal because it's a big country with a very diverse population.\n\n'But we don't have this problem in Bulgaria, I can assure you of that.'\n\nSterling, posting to Twitter, responded to those comments by saying: 'Mmmmh ... Not sure about this one chief.'\n\nIt is the first time that UEFA's protocols on tackling racist abuse have been implemented for an England game.\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke revealed that England players and backroom staff are providing witness statements so that UEFA and Bulgarian police can conduct a full investigation into the racist incidents at the match.\n\nMr Clarke blamed a group of around 50 Bulgarian fans, who were all dressed in black and gathered together in section of the home end.\n\nBulgarian fans with hoods and face masks head for the exits after the second stoppage\n\nHe said: 'It was difficult to pick out individuals, but they were all doing it. It was terrible racism.\n\n'The players reported it to the referee, and they spoke with him and the manager. I told Gareth at half time that whatever he wanted to do, he had my full support. He's now with the team and wants to spend some time with them to make sure that they are OK.\n\n'He's concerned about their welfare and the impact that this could have on them. I'd like to say it is shocking but it is not.'", "description": "The England and Manchester City star was the victim of racist abuse during the 6-0 win, in which he scored two of the goals and set up another to silence the hateful chants in Sofia.", "authors": ["Sam Mcevoy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/08/19727338-0-image-a-24_1571122815403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
