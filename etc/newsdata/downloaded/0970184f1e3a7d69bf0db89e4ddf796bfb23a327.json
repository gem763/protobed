Many people are perceiving better opportunities elsewhere,\u201d he said.\n\nThe outlook for Pietermaritzburg is the same.\n\nBruce Campbell of Natal Property Consultants said they had also seen a surge in selling of property because of emigration in Pietermaritzburg in the last six months.\n\n\u201cPeople are fed up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn top of the list is the non-service delivery of Msunduzi Municipality,\u201d he said.\n\nCampbell said he had recently sold a house in Hayfields where the owner was emigrating to another country in Africa.\n\n\u201cHe commented on the lack of service in the municipality. It starts at the top and goes all the way down and it\u2019s very sad. There is just no service delivery anymore.\u201d\n\nCampbell said a lot of sellers who were leaving had mentioned the \u201cworsening state\u201d of Pietermaritzburg and a lack of \u201cpolitical will\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are leaving Pietermaritzburg to go overseas or to other places within the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPietermaritzburg estate agent Alan Martin also reiterated that people had become frustrated with service delivery.\n\n\u201cThey are saying there isn\u2019t a future for them in a city that\u2019s going downhill as it is. There is a feeling of negativity amongst a lot of Maritzburg residents, especially people who have lived here for many years.\u201d\n\nMartin said he has also had a few clients relocating their businesses.\n\n\u201cThe problem is there is not a lot of business coming into Pietermaritzburg and it\u2019s impacting the property market,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMunyaradzi Nkomo, the managing director of Strategies Migration Services South Africa, told Weekend Witness his firm has noticed an uptake in emigration inquiries since the middle of last year.\n\nThe country\u2019s subsequent ratings downgrade paired with the economic implications and former president Jacob Zuma\u2019s policy changes had spurred emigration interests.\n\n\u201cWhen things got a bit shaky in South Africa, we noticed an increase in inquiries. People wanted to know what their options were,\u201d said Nkomo.\n\n\u201cWe also saw an increase in people who were looking to leave the country before the ANC conference in 2017. More and more people were keen to move to seek a more stable environment to live in.\u201d\n\nReports that large numbers of white South Africans were looking to leave the country because of farm murders and the land expropriation issue were an exaggeration, Nkomo said.\n\n\u201cPeople are moving in numbers. And it\u2019s not just SA citizens but foreigners who live in South Africa. In the global village we live in, the country is competing with First World countries for human resources and the difference is other countries have made it easier for a foreigner to reside in the countries while we have made it harder.\u201d\n\nAustralia and the UK rank as some of the most popular destinations for South Africans to emigrate to. \u201cAustralia is very popular, then the UK, Canada and the U.S. We also often get inquiries for certain EU countries such as Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands.\u201d\n\nA Pietermaritzburg resident, who asked to remain unnamed, said he was considering emigrating to Canada.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I are looking to start a family and the outlook on security and growth in this country is bleak,\u201d the resident said.\n\nHe said he was looking at Canada because of its \u201cgood attributes and overall diversity\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe cost of living, food, electricity [and] water has increased. Although we are hard working professionals we are not living as comfortably as it should be,\u201d the resident said.\n\nNumber of citizens leaving expected to rise sharply\n\nIt\u2019s expected that the number of South Africans leaving the country this year will rise sharply as politics, crime and job security are cited as reasons to go.\n\nCity Press reported recently that although neither the Department of Home Affairs nor the International Relations Department keeps figures on how many people are leaving the country for good, anecdotal evidence suggests a sharp rise in emigration among South Africans seeking new lives abroad as they become increasingly fearful of the current economic and political situation.\n\nExperts predicted that last year would prove to be a record year for emigration after a spike in 2015, when more than 25 000 citizens moved abroad.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics told City Press that, in 2017, an estimated 7 300 people emigrated from South Africa to the UK.\n\nRyan Rennison, managing director of UK visa solutions firm Move Up, said the company had seen a 22% hike in inquiries to leave in the past two years because of political uncertainty and economic decline.\n\n\u201cThere is a percentage of migrations motivated by concerns of financial and educational stability. Few cases are motivated by concerns of security alone,\u201d Rennison told City Press.\n\nThe most recent figures on emigration come from Stats SA\u2019s Community Survey 2016, a large-scale survey conducted between censuses.\n\nThe survey showed that 97 460 South Africans had moved abroad since 2006. The bulk of them were between the ages of 25 and 44.\n\nOf the almost 100 000 \u00e9migr\u00e9s, 12,5% had moved to Australia, 12% to the UK, 6,5% to the U.S. and 4,6% to New Zealand.\n\nThe trend is set to continue this year.\n\nMoira Luyckx, marketing manager for international removals company Elliott Mobility, said they had dealt with 2 500 moves abroad last year, \u201cand we are expecting an approximately 20% increase\u201d.\n\nAmong the most popular destinations, she said, were New Zealand, Canada, Australia, the UK, the U.S., France, Germany, Mauritius and Panama.\n\n\u201cPeople are emigrating for job and family prospects. There are also some who are relocated by local and global corporations for their specific skills,\u201d she said.\n\nStuttaford Van Lines\u2019 marketing manager, Rocco Olivier, said the firm was also expecting more clients this year.\n\n\u201cWe deal with thousands of families a year, with an average increase of 15% year on year,\u201d he said, adding that his clients \u2014 \u201ca true mixture of all ages and races\u201d \u2014 move for various reasons, including financial, political or family reasons. Others, he said, were transferred abroad within multinational companies.\n\nMany, he added, were qualified and skilled workers.\n\nThe most popular destinations his clients emigrate to are the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Others move to the U.S., Canada, Asia, the rest of Africa and parts of the Middle East.\n\nThis, says the Homecoming Revolution \u2014 a Pan-African company that encourages Africans to return home \u2014 is not good news.\n\n\u201cWe exist to bring Africa\u2019s skills back. For every one skilled African who returns home, they have a ripple effect of directly creating 12 new jobs in the formal and informal sectors,\u201d said managing director Faye Tessendorf.\n\nShe said there was a trend for predominantly white South Africans to leave because they had access to dual nationality and ancestral passports because of where their families came from.\n\n\u201cWhat drives talent out of the country is political violence, a rapid increase in crime and uncertainty in the economy,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMany young families just starting out unfortunately worry for their children\u2019s safety and the opportunities they will have. So, if they move, they decide to do so just before their kids start school so that they are not disrupted later on in life.\u201d\n\nHome Affairs spokesperson David Hlabane referred inquiries to the Department of International Relations and Co-operation as it \u201chas a voluntary online programme through which people going abroad may register called Register South Africans Abroad\u201d.\n\nDepartment spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya said: \u201cThe only way government knows that you are out of the country is when you stamp your passport at the airport or any border.\n\n\u201cThat function is with the International Relations Department, not ours. We also get information from them. We cannot help you beyond here.\u201d\n\n\u2014 City Press.", "description": "Grime, crime and the unstable economy are some of the driving factors behind Maritzburgers selling off their properties to live overseas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7079/79561a27a37f4e92ad3c750b7d90827d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-31"}
