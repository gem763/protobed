All these are our big achievements and inspire us to work harder.\u201d\n\nModi did not mention the irritations between the two sides, saying only that he and Xi had \u201cdiscussed important bilateral and global issues.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Terror threat \u2013\n\nThe buildup to the summit has been dominated by India\u2019s move in August to end the autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir state.\n\nChanges ordered by the New Delhi government will see Kashmir\u2019s Ladakh region \u2014 part of which is claimed by Beijing \u2014 turned into a separate Indian administrative territory.\n\nIndia has moved closer to the United States and its allies in seeking a counter-weight to China\u2019s growing military shadow in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nIt has been infuriated by China\u2019s diplomatic backing for Pakistan, which controls a large chunk of Muslim-majority Kashmir. The Himalayan region has been a longstanding source of conflict between India and Pakistan.\n\nBut at talks on Friday, the leaders acknowledged the common fight against \u201cterrorism\u201d, Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said.\n\nModi and Xi said \u201cthat radicalisation was a matter of concern to both, and that both would work together to see that radicalisation and terrorism did not affect the fabric of our multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious societies\u201d, Gokhale told reporters.\n\nChina made no immediate comment on the summit. But the official Xinhua news agency said Xi received a \u201cwarm welcome\u201d from Modi and they agreed their countries \u201cshould respect and learn from each other so as to jointly achieve common development and prosperity.\u201d\n\nModern rivalry between India and China \u2014 which each have populations of more than 1.3 billion people \u2014 dates back decades.\n\nThey went to war in 1962 over disputed Himalayan territory and other border standoffs remain.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader and long an aggravation for China, is based at Dharamsala in northern India.\n\nIndian police detained Tibetan students to prevent any protests during Xi\u2019s visit.\n\nPart of Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road mega-infrastructure programme is planned in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Xi held talks with Prime Minister Imran Khan in Beijing just two days before meeting Modi.\n\nWhen Xi said he supports Pakistan\u2019s \u201clegitimate rights\u201d, India\u2019s foreign ministry thundered that it was \u201cnot for other countries to comment on the internal affairs of India\u201d.\n\nOn commerce, India and China are both facing a protectionist US and want greater access to each other\u2019s markets. India in particular is concerned by China\u2019s $57 billion surplus in their joint trade.\n\nGokhale said the leaders talked about enhancing trade and investment, \u201cand this also obviously included the issue of the trade deficit\u201d.\n\nChina in turn wants India to ignore Western security concerns on telecoms giant Huawei \u2014 already a big player in the Indian mobile sector \u2014 so that it can be a key part of India\u2019s transformation to 5G communications.\n\nHuawei\u2019s \u201ccontribution to India\u2019s economic and social development is obvious to all,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry said this week, calling on India to make \u201cindependent and objective judgments and decisions\u201d.", "description": "MAHABALIPURAM (India) (AFP) \u2013 India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Saturday that his summit with Chinese leader Xi Xinping would launch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/c3da57_india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-told-chinese-president-xi-jinping-summit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
