DBS Must Bulk Up or Lose Fintech Turf in Southeast Asia\n\n(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Southeast Asia\u2019s largest lender happens to be its most tech-savvy. Why then is Singapore\u2019s DBS Group Holdings Ltd. missing out on some of the region\u2019s hottest deals in digital banking?\n\nIn recent years, technology has played a large role in the bank\u2019s profitable pivot away from trade financing to corporate cash management. One of its application programming interfaces that hooks up with customers' software \u2013 it has some 500 of them \u2013 allows merchants on Indonesian e-retailer PT Bukalapak.com to get paid in real time. The same technology allows drivers at ride-hailing company Gojek to get fares credited from their app wallets into bank accounts. But though DBS is the most aggressive of Singapore\u2019s three home-grown banks, bigger international rivals are capturing prime deals in its backyard. The No. 1 challenger is Citigroup Inc.\n\nThis week, the U.S. bank won the mandate to issue the first co-branded credit card for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s Lazada operates online stores in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Back in June, ride-share behemoth Grab Holdings Inc. announced a similar card partnership. That, too, was snagged by Citi.\n\nThis matters intensely. The internet economy in Southeast Asia, a region of nearly 650 million people, is on track to exceed $100 billion this year before tripling by 2025, according to research released Thursday by Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.\u2019s Google, Temasek Holdings Pte and Bain & Co. Financing. Online commerce, which sits at the intersection of consumer and transaction banking, has become a new battleground. Tech companies want to deal with banks that can wrap their traditional offering of cash management with services that are important to end-customers, such as simple user interfaces.\n\nIt isn\u2019t so much that DBS is slackening but that far bigger competitors are moving onto its turf. The fact that Citi customers in Asia can pay for their Spotify (NYSE: ) subscriptions with card points made it into the U.S. bank\u2019s annual report. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has invested $40 billion on technology in four years and is hawking new capabilities to Asian corporate clients.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ).\u2019s foray into digital consumer banking may have been a money-losing proposition so far. But its credit card with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). shows that Goldman, too, will eventually come for a slice of Southeast Asia\u2019s banking services market. So will Japanese lenders, propelled by negative interest rates at home.\n\nDBS\u2019s lack of scale outside Singapore isn\u2019t for want of trying. In 2013, nationalist politics in Indonesia thwarted its $6.5 billion acquisition of PT Bank Danamon, which eventually fell in the lap of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. Since then, DBS has acquired Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.\u2019s retail and wealth businesses in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Indonesia. It\u2019s open to more such \u201cbolt-on\u201d acquisitions where it can overlay physical assets with its digital strategy, CEO Piyush Gupta told Bloomberg TV last month.\n\nMore is definitely needed. DBS has less than S$24 billion ($17 billion) in assets in South and Southeast Asian markets \u2013 mainly comprising Indonesia, India and Malaysia\u2019s offshore financial center at Labuan. It\u2019s a fraction of the bank\u2019s assets of S$355 billion in Singapore and S$90 billion in Hong Kong. Total income from South and Southeast Asia was under S$800 million last year, and after-tax profit was just S$1 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Citi\u2019s local regulatory filings suggest that about 28% of its $14.5 billion Asia revenue \u2013 or $4 billion \u2013 came from Southeast Asia, with Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the $500-million-plus annual revenue club. This is why I\u2019ve previously argued that any calls by dissident shareholders for Citi CEO Mike Corbat to ditch its Asian consumer banking business should be rejected. That balance sheet is important to the corporate and investment bank, and for bagging deals like leading the startup Gojek\u2019s financing round.\n\nWorld trade is in the doldrums. Southeast Asia\u2019s larger economies aren\u2019t immune to a global slowdown, but they\u2019re weathering it relatively better than China and India. The rise of consumer tech is where the opportunity lies. Even local lenders like Indonesia\u2019s Bank Central Asia Tbk are doing online-payment partnership deals, such as with shopping app Shopee.\n\nAt the annual DBS investor day two years ago, analysts were pleasantly surprised to learn from Chief Financial Officer Chng Sok Hui that consumer and small-enterprise banking in Singapore and Hong Kong \u2013 44% of the lender\u2019s business \u2013 was already three-fifths digital. The expectation was that online prowess would give DBS an edge in its neighborhood. It isn\u2019t panning out that well.\n\nTo make the most of its digital promise, DBS needs to bulk up in Southeast Asia. The outcome isn\u2019t entirely in its hands. One test will be whether Indonesian President Joko Widodo\u2019s recent promise to further open up the economy will make Singaporean banks more welcome. Whether Southeast Asia moves toward becoming a single economic area treating financial institutions the same across borders will also matter. Ultimately, politics will determine who gets to profit from financing the region\u2019s coming $300 billion internet economy.", "description": "DBS Must Bulk Up or Lose\u00a0Fintech Turf in Southeast Asia", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEA9D02G_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
