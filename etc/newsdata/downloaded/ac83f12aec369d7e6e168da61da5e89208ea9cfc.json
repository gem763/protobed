(Peter and Maria Hoey/for The Washington Post)\n\nGabrielle Chodes owns a condo in a historic four-unit building in Northwest Washington\u2019s West End neighborhood. She is happy the circa-1896 building has a preservation easement with the L\u2019Enfant Trust because she agrees with the trust\u2019s mission of protecting historic buildings. The trust holds conservation easements on more than 1,100 historic properties in the District.\n\n\u201cI wish D.C. would encourage more property owners to put their buildings into a similar status in order to protect the character of the city,\u201d Chodes said.\n\nMany homeowners may not be familiar with easements, but they\u2019re often an essential part of a historic house.\n\nA preservation easement is a voluntary legal agreement between a homeowner and a preservation organization that ensures a property\u2019s historic character is protected. The easement remains on the property regardless of who owns the property after it\u2019s put in place.\n\nEasements can be a useful preservation tool for both parties \u2014 the owner who donates certain rights to an easement-holding organization, as well as the preservation organization. By having regulatory control over changes that can be made to a building, a preservation organization helps maintain a city\u2019s architectural heritage. The property owner benefits from the federal income tax deduction for the value of the easement. Federal estate taxes may also be reduced.\n\nAccording to Ross Bradford, deputy general counsel at the National Trust for Historic Preservation, though the tax incentive is significant, most homeowners are concerned foremost about safeguarding their house\u2019s historic integrity.\n\n\u201cMost people see the easement as a way to maintain that property after they\u2019ve passed away or after they sell the property,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know that it\u2019s protected and won\u2019t be changed and altered in a way that would be detrimental to its historic significance.\u201d\n\nChodes recalls two Civil War-era rowhouses that once stood on her street. Neither had a historic easement, which allowed developers to demolish them and replace them with new, much larger buildings.\n\n\u201cThe message seems to be that owners in huge new buildings can live in a lovely, historic neighborhood \u2014 but the effect is to change that neighborhood,\u201d Chodes said. \u201cIf you start losing one, two, three houses, all of a sudden you do not live in a neighborhood of lovely, old buildings. So, I think it is very important that every house be valued since part of the charm comes from seeing them all together, as a neighborhood, as representative of a different era, but still useful today.\u201d\n\nWhile Bradford echoes Chodes\u2019s emphasis on the importance of neighborhood charm, he says preservation can also lift property values.\n\n\u201cIf you have enough of these easements in a location, and the area is not already locally regulated, you maintain the integrity of the historic character of the neighborhood and generally speaking, that sort of integrity increases property values,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of insensitive alterations made to the buildings, and there\u2019s a lot of local character.\u201d\n\nEasement-protected properties come with responsibilities and restrictions. Hannah Bergman lives on Capitol Hill and owns a rowhouse built in 1907. Because the previous owners donated it to the L\u2019Enfant Trust, she gets none of the tax benefits, but is responsible for the costs of maintaining the property.\n\n\u201cAt the time I purchased the house, I didn\u2019t fully grasp what that would mean, and it\u2019s certainly been a challenge to adapt my budget to the requirements any time there\u2019s a renovation necessary,\u201d she said.\n\nBergman, who loves old homes and purposefully bought one with its original features, said she would have purchased the home regardless of the easement. But she now understands better what owning such a home entails. She said she normally wouldn\u2019t have purchased the expensive vinyl windows that her home\u2019s easement required.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to consider is what renovations you plan to do and how the easement rules will affect your budget, especially if you\u2019re purchasing a property after the donation has been made,\u201d Bergman said.\n\nBecause of the various restrictions on easement-protected homes, the argument can be made that easements aren\u2019t beneficial for property value. Lauren McHale, president and CEO of the L\u2019Enfant Trust, agrees with Bradford that maintaining historic charm is positive for a community, but she\u2019s hesitant to say it increases property values.\n\n\u201cIf you look at it on a real individual basis, if you take two identical rowhouses and one has a conservation easement on it and one does not, and they\u2019re both for sale, a potential buyer is probably going to buy the one that doesn\u2019t have an easement on it,\u201d McHale said.\n\n\u201c[An easement] is an added burden to the property. If they want to replace their windows, if they want to repaint their house, if they want to build an addition, if they want a fence around their yard, they have to come to us for all of that.\u201d\n\nEasements are not for everyone. They are not for homeowners who prefer complete freedom to make changes to their homes. But for homeowners such as Bergman and Chodes, who appreciate character-driven properties, they offer a way to protect their home\u2019s historic legacy. Although they admit the restrictions can be an additional hurdle, they don\u2019t mind the extra steps.\n\n\u201cI think historical easements are an important tool to protect properties and are key to preserving the character of the city,\u201d Bergman wrote in an email. \u201cWhether it makes sense for any one person to own a house with an easement really depends on the state of the house, how much investment and upkeep are needed, and what an owner\u2019s financial situation looks like. \u2026 It seems to me that the biggest benefits for preservation come when the easements are available outside of the already existing historic districts.\u201d", "description": "Though many homeowners may not be familiar with easements, they\u2019re often an essential part of a historic house.", "authors": ["Nina Zafar", "Reporter", "Editorial Aide For Reliable Source", "September At Am", "Nina Zafar Is A Reporter", "Editorial Aide For Reliable Source.
