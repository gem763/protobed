The money advice site says this could equate to as many as 70,000 students across the UK.\n\nSharing intimate photos and selling used underwear are the most popular types of erotica polled students undertake to cover the spiralling cost of tuition fees and living \u2013 along with signing up to sugar-daddy dating sites, nude modelling, phone sex or, in seven percent of cases, prostitution.\n\n\n\nRecent graduate Steph* says the stats don't surprise her. She signed up for anonymous naked web-cam work to get by while studying for her degree.\n\n\n\n'It's not something I'm proud of,' she told ELLE, 'but my student loan didn't stretch far enough \u2013 and I could earn more in one day [stripping online] than I would in a week working in a shop or a pub.'\n\nShe says 'a few' of her friends also signed up to sugar-daddy sites to meet older men who would give them money in return for dates.\n\nPhoto credit: Sophie Mayanne - Getty Images More\n\nThe cash went towards paying bills, clearing overdrafts and buying essentials like food, she explains.\n\nAmy* says she got into sex work through a friend who told her she was an exotic dancer.\n\n'She would often come home with hundreds of pounds from a few hours work,' she tells ELLE. 'I was absolutely terrified, but I had little options that didn\u2019t involve taking another part-time job that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in, so I thought it was probably worth a shot.\n\n'I started really slow. I didn\u2019t go straight into strip clubs, I set up accounts on dating sites advertising myself selling naked pictures, or niche pictures like of my feet. They would send money to my PayPal account in exchange for pictures. I was extremely careful to leave my face and personal information out of all of this.\n\nPhoto credit: myriam meloni - Getty Images More\n\n'The first time I sold a picture was to a man, in his late 60s, who was looking for several pictures of my feet covered in mud. He paid \u00a360 for two photos. The second time was a full frontal nude picture (not including my face) for \u00a350. After the first few times I grew comfortable with it, realising how trivial it was to take off your clothes for someone who is paying you a fair amount of money to do so.'\n\nStory continues", "description": "'Stripping for strangers online paid for my degree,' one former student tells ELLE", "authors": ["Natalie Cornish"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.Mq4zhBlNfYNKohJayOvRQ--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/c7cb6b5d89de98a9f204b99fa6824770", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
