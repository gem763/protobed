They will find their way if they're playing regularly.\n\n'I would think in the next few weeks, if they're both going to be in the team, then they will come under the spotlight. Gareth has a blueprint of putting young players in and changing it, which is quite refreshing.\n\n'So if they keep playing to a certain level, everything will find them, whether it's international call-ups, new contracts, new cars, the whole lot will fall into place.'\n\nBruce, meanwhile, says the club will be doing their utmost to make sure they do not lose Matty at the end of this season.\n\nSean has impressed for Newcastle but is yet to play for his country under Gareth Southgate\n\nHis \u00a3850-per-week deal expires next summer and he would be free to talk to foreign clubs from January.\n\nAnd Bruce said: 'It's going to be above me. Lee Charnley (managing director) will be on with that, but we'll do our utmost to make sure we don't lose our best young players.\n\n'I'm sure we'll be all out to get that tied up - and his brother, which is vitally important.'\n\nThe brothers will start at Chelsea this afternoon after Bruce confirmed that Matty has retained his place.\n\n'How could I leave him out?' he said. 'From day one, he's been knocking on the door. It was always a case of, \"When do I put him in?\".'", "description": "Steve Bruce has told the Longstaff brothers not to worry about their absence from the England set-up - because Gareth Southgate will soon be at St James' Park if their current form continues.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/22/19904190-0-image-a-13_1571433756923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
