That can include private equity, venture capital, direct investing in debt and equity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a depth to the private company universe,\u201d she notes. \u201cIn terms of innovation, it\u2019s quite rich.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not pursuing single companies but accessing the private sphere through a professional portfolio manager.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t look at individual companies as that would require targeted due diligence and would take a very long time. Instead we are working with professional money managers that source private equity and private debt investments,\u201d she adds.\n\n'Non-homogenous umbrella'\n\nPrivate debt fund manager Bob Sahota, chief investment officer of Revolution Asset Management, calls the private sphere \u201ca non-homogenous umbrella\u201d.\n\nPrivate debt fund manager Bob Sahota, chief investment officer of Revolution Asset Management. Jessica Hromas\n\nIn debt markets, for example, a private investment can cover corporate loans, infrastructure debt and special situation debt such as distressed debt.\n\n\u201cLending to a fish and chip shop is private debt,\" says Sahota, former head of fixed income at Challenger.\n\nHe now runs a fund that invests in private debt, which launched in February 2018. The fund vehicle\u2019s terms were \u201cquite stringent\u201d when it launched, he says, including a long lock-up period. Investors were unenthusiastic about investing in the fund at that time, he admits.\n\n\u201cInvestors said \u2018it sounds interesting but the structure isn\u2019t good and we are not locking up our money\u2019,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as interest rates have come down, investor focus on returns has sharpened.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much yield in the market,\u201d Sahota says. \u201cNow 6 per cent to 7 per cent is considered to be high yield. Everything with a plus in front of it looks quite good now.\u201d\n\nBut there are risks to private market investing, including opaque valuations and illiquidity.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective we don\u2019t typically recommend private investments,\u201d says Vincent O\u2019Neill, director of private wealth at financial planning firm Stanford Brown.\n\n\u201cIt has a role,\u201d he adds, but \u201cwe are not adding private assets at the core\".\n\nThose of his clients who invest in private markets are usually leveraging off their own experience, he adds. Typically they have specialist knowledge.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for some of these private investments is that they can look attractive but they are not always,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe are not against it but it needs due diligence.\u201d\n\nRight diversification\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivate investments can be difficult to enter due to minimum investment levels and there may not be the same level of disclosure as in publicly listed assets, he notes.\n\nO'Neill cautions against heavily weighting portfolios towards the private sphere.\n\n\"Investors need the right diversification. These assets have a role to play but you don\u2019t want to end up in concentrated positions,\" he says. \u201cIf private investments were 20 per cent to 30 per cent of a portfolio, we would be quite cautious.\"\n\nO\u2019Neill cites physical gold as an example of an asset that would be a \u201cprivate investment you probably don\u2019t want to own\u201d, given the difficulty of storing gold.\n\n\"There are going to be risks and you have to understand the risks that you are taking,\" he adds.\n\n\"There is a risk to illiquid investments but it is balancing that risk and reward and mitigating risk by due diligence [that is key],\u201d says Crowther-Pal.\n\nFees can be on the high side, she adds, But fees reflect high barriers to entry and the extensive filtering processes by portfolio managers, she adds. \"These fund managers are distilling a very large universe through to a very small space.\n\n\"Investors have to ask if the fees are worth the alpha generated. It\u2019s a space to watch from an investment perspective but, as with all investments, you need to be very sceptical.\u201d", "description": "As valuations have risen in many publicly listed assets, the challenge of achieving an appropriate return has increased incrementally.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3826%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_429%2C$y_92/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2e7e0432810d30d3d5d5fd1c54543ae9898a3823", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
