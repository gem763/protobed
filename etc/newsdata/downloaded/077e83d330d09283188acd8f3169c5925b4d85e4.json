The podcast follows the U.S. Marshals' ongoing mission to find Lester Eubanks, a dangerous convict who escaped from police custody in 1973 and has never been found.\n\nWhen convicted murderer Lester Eubanks was sent to death row in 1966, he was entering a prison system beset by a tarnished history of violence and cruelty, similar to conditions portrayed in the fictional 1994 film \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"\n\nThose conditions were not the only parallels to the durable Hollywood movie. While the \"Shawshank\" story was set in Maine, the movie itself was filmed in Eubanks' hometown of Mansfield, Ohio, at a menacing prison with a 25-foot-high stone wall.\n\nPHOTO: Ohio State Reformatory prison located in Mansfield, Ohio.

The prisons looked a lot alike -- medieval castles of stone and iron designed to buckle the knees of arriving convicts.\n\nPHOTO: Lester Eubanks was sent to death row at the Ohio State Penitentiary, a facility torn down in the mid-1980s.

Forty-five minutes away was the Ohio State Reformatory, which was closed in the early 1990s after a lawsuit alleged barbaric conditions. That structure became the film set for the \"Shawshank\" movie and now operates as a prison museum.\n\n(MORE: 'Have You Seen This Man' podcast: US Marshals' top 'Most Wanted')\n\nMichael Humphrey served time there for theft in the late 1960s, during the same period Eubanks was incarcerated in Columbus.\n\n(MORE: 'Have You Seen This Man': US Marshals renew call for tips to find inmate)\n\n\"I know exactly what this place was like,\" Humphrey told ABC News. \"I know what it smelled like, what it sounded like, and, you know, everything that went on here\u2026 I hated this place so bad.\"\n\nPHOTO: The identification room inside the Ohio State Penitentiary, a facility torn down in the mid-1980s. (Courtesy of the Ohio History Connection) More\n\nIf anything, Humphrey said, the Ohio prisons were even more violent than the one portrayed in \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" which stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It's a story that shows Robbins\u2019 character, Andy Dufrense, beaten by guards, confined in blackness for days and raped and tormented by other prisoners.\n\n\"In 1972, there were two guys that were feuding,\" Humphrey recalled. \"One was a barber and the other guy was forced to sit down in his chair. [The barber] sharpened up his straight razor and cut the man\u2019s throat, and he bled out on the floor.\"", "description": "This report is part of the ABC News podcast, \"Have You Seen This Man?,\" hosted by 'The View's' Sunny Hostin.
