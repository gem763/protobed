The Facebook post said \"leaked information was part of the strategy being schemed by radical protesters in their online chat rooms\".\n\nThe former British colony of Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent legal system, triggering the anger over the extradition bill.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said she will withdraw the bill but many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is steadily eroding the city's autonomy.\n\nChina denies meddling and has accused the United States, Britain and others of fomenting the unrest.\n\n\"We don\u2019t even need to do a fact check to know that this is fake news,\" protester Michael, 24, said of the China Daily post.\n\n\"The state media doesn\u2019t care about its credibility. Whenever something they claimed to have heard on WhatsApp or friends\u2019 friends, they will spread it right away,\" he said.\n\nThe protesters called off action on Wednesday.\n\n\"In solidarity against terrorism, all forms of protest in Hong Kong will be suspended on Sept. 11, apart from potential singing and chanting,\" they said in a statement.\n\nProtester Karen, 23, said the China Daily report was worrying.\n\n\u201cWhen they try to frame the whole protest with those words, it alarms me. They are predicting rather than reporting,\" she said. \"I think people calling it off today is a nice move.\n\nThe protests spread to the sports field on Tuesday, as many football fans defied Chinese law to boo the national anthem ahead of a soccer World Cup qualifier against Iran.\n\nSeveral peaceful protests are planned for coming days, combining with festivities marking the Mid-Autumn Festival.
