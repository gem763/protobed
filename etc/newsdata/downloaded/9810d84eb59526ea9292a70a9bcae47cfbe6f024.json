We believe in each other,\u201d said Brantley. \u201cIt was a big homer by them but to answer in the next inning and go to the World Series, I can\u2019t find the words.\u201d\n\nGurriel smashed a three run homer in the first inning to open the scoring and the Astros also turned a double play to end the top half of the eighth inning and preserve a two run lead.\n\nHouston starter Brad Peacock pitched 1 2/3 innings giving up two hits and one run before the relievers took over. The bullpen kept New York in check until LeMahieu tied it in the ninth with a two-run homer to right field.\n\n\u2013 Cruel ending \u2013\n\nIt\u2019s the third time the Astros have eliminated New York in the past five playoffs.\n\nHouston won the 2015 wild-card game in New York and eliminated the Yankees in seven games in the 2017 ALCS before winning their first title.\n\nYankees starting pitcher Chad Green lasted just one inning after he surrendered the home run to Gurriel. Green allowed two hits and three runs, walking one.\n\nFirst baseman LeMahieu won a 10-pitch clash, which included fouling off four two-strike pitches.\n\nWhen Astros closer Roberto Osuna left a pitch over the middle of the plate, LeMahieu drilled it 351 feet the opposite way just over the right field fence for a game-tying home run that silenced the crowd.\n\nThe Yankees have now lost four straight AL Championship Series.\n\n\u201cIt is as painful as it can be in sports,\u201d Boone said. \u201cWe know we are going to get to the top of the mountain. And we are going to have the battle scars to prove it.\u201d", "description": "Houston (AFP) \u2013 Jose Altuve hit a two-run walk off homer to lift the Houston Astros to a 6-4 win Saturday over the New York Yankees and punch their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/0b5ee1_houston-jose-altuve-hit-walk-off-two-run-homer-as-astros-booked-spot-in-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
