Federal Election Commission filings disclosing a huge contribution Fruman made to a Republican joint fundraising committee last year don\u2019t just misspell his last name; they falsely list him as an actual Los Angeles-based doctor named Igor Furman.\n\nThe contribution at issue was a $100,000 donation in April 2018 to House Majority Trust, a fundraising account benefiting the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee. The group\u2019s FEC filings list the donor as Igor Furman, not Igor Fruman. And while the address listed on the filing is the same one as the Miami-area condo owned by the Giuliani-tied Fruman, the occupation listed on the filing is the one associated with the L.A. doctor, founder of a company called Qualified Billing & Collections.\n\nFurman, the doctor, had donated to Giuliani\u2019s presidential campaign in 2007 and went to medical school in the same city\u2014Odessa, Ukraine\u2014from which the indicted Fruman hails. But he never made a donation to House Majority Trust, a spokesperson for the company confirmed to The Daily Beast.\n\nAsked whether Fruman had intentionally misrepresented his identity to House Majority Trust in making the contribution, his attorney John Dowd told The Daily Beast, \u201cNo idea. Ask Dr. Furman.\u201d When informed that the actual Dr. Furman had denied making the contribution, and asked again whether his client had intentionally misreported details of his identity, Dowd repeated, \u201cNo idea.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Trust\u2019s treasurer did not respond to repeated questions about Fruman\u2019s donation and how it was reported.\n\nWhat might otherwise be a simple paperwork error or an innocuous case of mistaken identity is uniquely relevant\u2014and potentially problematic\u2014after prosecutors accused Fruman last week of deliberately obscuring his identity in reporting personal information accompanying his large political contributions. It is illegal under federal law to \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d make a political contribution in the name of another person, in particular as part of an effort to evade campaign contribution limits.\n\nThe indictment issued in Fruman\u2019s case highlighted one of his 2018 donations and noted, \"the contribution\u2014and several other significant contributions made at and around the same time\u2014was made in the name of \u2018Igor Furman\u2019 not IGOR FRUMAN, the defendant.\u201d Prosecutors alleged that the mistakes were not typos or innocent misstatements of fact, but rather part of an \u201ceffort to conceal the source of the funds and to evade federal reporting requirements.\u201d\n\nFEC forms list the misspelled version of Fruman\u2019s name in other high-dollar contributions, including a pair of $50,000 contributions to another joint fundraising committee called Protect the House. But unlike his House Majority Trust contribution, those list his employer as \u201cImport Export Corp,\u201d Fruman\u2019s Odessa-based business.\n\nThe Furman who founded Qualified Billing & Collections made just one other federal campaign contribution in the years since he donated to Giuliani. In 2014, he gave $1,000 to the House campaign of California Republican Elan Carr.\n\nIn February of this year, Trump tapped Carr to be the State Department\u2019s special envoy for monitoring and combating anti-Semitism.", "description": "The effort to hide campaign donations may be more deceptive than previously known.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay", "Sam Stein", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571287420/191017-igor-fruman-hero_ra2qsm", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
