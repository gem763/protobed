(Photo: Robyn Von Swank)\n\nYears ago, Anjelah Johnson moved to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming an actress. She\u2019s landed a number of acting roles through the years, but it was her side gig as a comedian that took off. \u201cComedy chose me,\u201d says the 37 year old, who is of Mexican and Native American descent. \u201cIf I were to have picked, I would have been an actress. But over the years I\u2019ve developed gratitude for this craft, for the ability to bring joy to people.\u201d\n\nThis fall she\u2019ll bring joy to a different city nearly every night on her Technically Not Stalking Tour. Johnson achieved internet fame in the late 2000s with viral clips of sketches centered on a character called Bon Qui Qui, an eccentric, uninhibited, faintly Latina homegirl who works at a fast-food joint.\n\nWhile her Mexican heritage was a significant theme of her early shows, these days Johnson is \u2026 well, just Johnson: \u201cWhen I first started doing stand-up, I was portraying myself and my family as what I thought people wanted. Like I would portray my mom with an accent, but my mom doesn\u2019t even speak Spanish. I\u2019m fourth generation, and my last name is Johnson, so I\u2019m not your typical Latina. It was when I started to be honest and own those things about me that my career really began to take off. Being Latino doesn\u2019t look like just one thing \u2014 we all have a different story.\u201d\n\nThese diverse stories are found in full glory among the growing number of Latino comedians. Here are just a few standouts in the world of stand-up:\n\nJohn Leguizamo and Justine Maurer attend the 70th Emmy Awards at Microsoft Theater on September 17, 2018, in Los Angeles.

The most recent of these, the Tony Award-winning Latin History for Morons, is touring nationally throughout 2019. The plot kicks off with Leguizamo deciding to teach his son about the ancient leaders of Latin America and proceeds to weave a hilarious tale with pointed relevance to the Latino experience today.\n\nCristela Alonzo\n\nCristela Alonzo attends The International Myeloma Foundation's 12th Annual Comedy Celebration at The Wilshire Ebell Theatre on November 3, 2018 in Los Angeles, Calif. (Photo: JC Olivera, Getty Images)\n\nSome comedians choose to stay out of politics, but Alonzo, who grew up along the Texas-Mexico border in a family that struggled with poverty, does not count herself in that camp. She advocates for issues involving immigration and universal health care. She made a name for herself in 2014 when she became the first Latina to have the starring role in a network TV sitcom, Cristela, which is based loosely on her childhood. She\u2019s also the first Latina to star in a Disney Pixar movie, Cars 3.\n\nSeason 1 Premiere Of Netflix's \" Mr. Iglesias\" at Regal Cinemas L.A. Live on June 20, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

Netflix will add two more specials to his comedy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 by the end of the year, and his debut sitcom, Mr. Iglesias, premiered on the platform this summer. Known for family-friendly comedy and endless jokes about his (significant) waistline, Iglesias is also an accomplished voice actor in animated films, including the Academy Award-winning Coco.\n\nSofia Nino De Rivera (Photo: Westwood Entertainment)\n\nSofia Nino De Rivera\n\nPerhaps the most revered standupero in Mexico today (she was named Mexico City\u2019s woman of the year in 2016), you\u2019ll probably have to travel south of the border to catch Nino de Rivera live. Or you can watch her on Netflix \u2014 she was the first Mexican woman to headline a Spanish-language comedy special on the online network. Lately, she\u2019s been putting on therapeutic comedy workshops at women\u2019s prisons across Mexico, an effort chronicled in a documentary due out this year.\n\nFelipe Esparza attends the Queen Mary's Dark Harbor Media & VIP Preview Event on September 28, 2017, in Long Beach, Calif. (Photo: Tommaso Boddi, Getty Images for The Ace Agency)\n\nFelipe Esparza\n\nAt the age of 21, Esparza found himself at a dead end \u2014 he\u2019d grown up in an immigrant family in the gang-heavy projects of East L.A. and ended up a teenage dad with a substance abuse problem. But he was able to turn his life around with a flourishing stand-up career, winning the Last Comic Standing competition in 2010, which led to opening shows for huge acts like Gabriel Iglesias. He will also star in the upcoming Netflix \u201cSpanglish dramedy\u201d Gentefied.\n\nUSA TODAY's Hispanic Living magazine (Photo: Investigation Discovery)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/10/06/john-leguizamo-cristela-alonza-standouts-world-standup/3854002002/", "description": "John Leguizamo, Cristela Alonza, are standout Latino comics", "authors": ["Brian Barth", "Published A.M.
