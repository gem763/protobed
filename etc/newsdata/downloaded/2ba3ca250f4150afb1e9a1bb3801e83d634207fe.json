We\u2019ve got fascism running afoot. You\u2019ve got disregard of rule of law. You\u2019ve got the balkanization of the populous. You\u2019ve got the devaluing and scapegoating of the weak, especially the Mexicans and Muslims and poor and black and brown. So the democracy is being imploded as it were.\u201d\n\nThe author said it was time for a moral and spiritual \u201cawakening\u201d that would ultimately end with Americans behind bars.\n\n\u201cThis is why if things don\u2019t work the way the system is we got to hit the streets, we\u2019ve got to go to jail,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Out Now is all about. Next Saturday, every Saturday it\u2019s going to be like Puerto Rico. It\u2019s going to like Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nMr. West also lambasted Mr. Trump for likening impeachment supporters to a political lynch mob.\n\n\u201cThe difference [between Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 claims] and people who are beautifully black like him have been the victims disproportionately as opposed to a vanilla brother or a vanilla sister,\u201d he told Mr. Lemon. \u201cBut he\u2019s still wrong. He\u2019s still wrong. Because it allows the use of the term to become so normalized that you act as if it was not tied to crimes against humanity, forms of American terrorism and linked to slavery in that way.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump outraged critics on Tuesday by tweeting: \u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2014 a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
