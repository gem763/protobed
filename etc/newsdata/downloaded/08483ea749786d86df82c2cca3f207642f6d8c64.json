In 2017, the two-term mayor of South Bend, Indiana, campaigned to become the chair of the Democratic National Committee. (He lost his only other non-mayoral race, to become Indiana state treasurer, in 2010.) Now he wants to be president. Buttigieg has generally struggled to distinguish himself from other mid-tier Democratic candidates, but after a pugnacious performance at the most recent Democratic debate, a new poll of Iowa primary voters showed the mayor in third place behind Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe poll was good news for Buttigieg, though he still faces a long and unlikely path to the nomination. The Buttigieg bump, if indeed it exists, may have happened for reasons that have nothing to do with the mayor\u2019s platform or rhetoric. Bernie Sanders recently suffered a heart attack, and Joe Biden\u2019s capacity to govern looks more dubious with each befuddling speech. Buttigieg is young and of sound mind, and for Iowa voters who aren\u2019t persuaded by Biden or the more progressive candidates, he might look like a safe alternative. \u201cMy lane has never been clearer,\u201d he told the press last week.\n\nBut attention invites scrutiny, and upon closer inspection the mayor\u2019s ambitions look cynical. Buttigieg appears determined to keep running for higher office until he wins something, anything at all \u2014 a blunt grab for power, even by the usual standards of politicians. But professional thirst isn\u2019t really what distinguishes Buttigieg from the pack. It\u2019s his branding. The mayor says he offers voters a fresh perspective on Democratic politics as usual. \u201cSuch a moment calls for hopeful and audacious voices from communities like ours,\u201d he said when he launched his presidential campaign. \u201cAnd yes, it calls for a new generation of leadership.\u201d\n\nThe Buttigieg brand isn\u2019t a recent invention. He\u2019s pitched himself as an alternative to bigger party names since at least the 2017 DNC-chair campaign. \u201cReliving 2016 is not really good for business for the Democratic Party,\u201d he told CNN at the time. Buttigieg spoke as if he occupied a third position in relation to progressive Keith Ellison and the more centrist Tom Perez. But it wasn\u2019t obvious then \u2014 or now \u2014 that Buttigieg is any different from many of the Democrats he wants to defeat. Until he ran for president, his ideology looked relatively opaque; he never divulged it in much detail to the public. Whenever he did stake out a position, it was to establish himself as a pragmatist, a progressive too caught up in the realities of governing to spend much time talking about grand theories of change.\n\nGosh! Okay... I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for All, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered. Now if you'll excuse me, potholes await. \u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) February 19, 2018\n\nBut running for president tends to clarify a person\u2019s ideology, and Buttigieg has recently encouraged speculation that he is pivoting to the right. He no longer supports Medicare for All and is even running ads against it. In a recent interview with Cosmopolitan, he said he still supports a proposal to expand the number of justices on the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 and that he would appoint more judges like Anthony Kennedy, who ruled against the Affordable Care Act and in favor of Citizens United, then stepped down to make way for a Trump nominee. While his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan is a definitive reversal, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Buttigieg has changed his overall ideology. The Buttigieg who admires the conservative Anthony Kennedy is the same Buttigieg who ran for DNC chair and for mayor. He is a technocratic liberal. He tried on Medicare for All for size and when it didn\u2019t fit, he recalibrated. The generational change he promised was never a political revolution.\n\nButtigieg is in no respect significantly out of step with the rest of his party. Even his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is impeccable. Harvard, Oxford, military service, a stint at McKinsey: Buttigieg didn\u2019t miss a beat. His father may have driven him around Indiana in a Chevy Cavalier, as he said at the debate, but his father was Joseph Buttigieg, a lauded professor at the University of Notre Dame, and Buttigieg attended private schools. It\u2019s not exactly the stuff of a Bruce Springsteen song. Instead, Buttigieg\u2019s background is relatively common for party leaders.\n\nThis also leaves him few ways to distinguish himself from his competitors. The Democratic Party has no shortage of middle-class white men with elite educations, even in the Midwest. If he\u2019s going to make sense as a meaningful alternative to his competitors, he has to distinguish himself politically \u2014 somehow. His mayoral record is all he has, and nothing in it suggests that he diverges significantly from elder Democrats like Biden. He is socially liberal and comfortable with corporate interests, namely, the tech industry. He seems to believe experts can save the world, or at least his city. He demolished abandoned homes to make way for development, tried to bring new tech jobs to the city, and enthusiastically embraced the Obama administration\u2019s Smart Cities Initiative, which set aside federal funding for municipal governments to collaborate with universities and tech companies. \u201cThe dream is to actually have a real-life version of SimCity at my fingertips,\u201d Buttigieg said in 2015. He repeated a version of the SimCity comment earlier this year in an interview with Wired. That time, the context wasn\u2019t the Smart Cities Initiative but SBStat, his own creation; Wired described it as \u201ca data-driven model of troubleshooting city services informed by Baltimore\u2019s CitiStat.\u201d\n\nIn SimCity, there are no living people, just data points assigned to neat little houses and urban-planning projects to game out and complete. Destroy the city and nobody real gets hurt. The player can simply start everything all over again. Buttigieg isn\u2019t delusional \u2014 he does not actually think that the people of South Bend are simulations \u2014 and tech could indeed make some city services more efficient. It\u2019s bizarre, though, for Buttigieg to repeatedly invoke SimCity as some sort of ideal. It is a computer game, not a realistic model for municipal government.\n\nBut the analogy usefully illustrates a crucial facet of the Buttigieg mind-set. On the subject of Silicon Valley and its promises of innovation, Buttigieg is a true believer, and donors know it. Bloomberg reported this week that Mark Zuckerberg has advised Buttigieg on key campaign hires, and the mayor previously brought Zuckerberg to South Bend for a chummy tour of the city. Buttigieg maintains those links to Zuckerberg even though the Facebook founder arguably represents Silicon Valley hubris at its most dangerous extreme. Facebook\u2019s sins are manifold, and since Zuckerberg controls 60 percent of the company\u2019s shares, he bears most of the blame. On his watch, Facebook heedlessly spread right-wing hate speech around the world, lied about the reach of its video ads, and violated the privacy of its users while claiming publicly to protect them. Zuckerberg himself considered giving away user data to reward some corporate partners and Zuckerberg\u2019s personal friends, as NBC News reported in 2018.\n\nIf Zuckerberg\u2019s actions bother Buttigieg, he doesn\u2019t show it. Instead, Zuckerberg and other corporate executives know they can count on the mayor\u2019s selective concern for the public good. It\u2019s a reciprocal arrangement. While candidates like Sanders and Warren tout the power of small donors and swear off big-money fundraisers, Buttigieg embraces them. Democrats won\u2019t defeat Trump with \u201cpocket change,\u201d he said derisively last week. A Guardian analysis published on Monday shows that the mayor pulls much of his financial support from business executives.\n\nSo much for the man-of-the-people act. Buttigieg\u2019s posture toward power is that of a supplicant, not a skeptic. It shows in his mayoral record, in its areas of inertia. Based on what residents themselves have told news outlets, it doesn\u2019t seem that Buttigieg has changed anything fundamental about the way South Bend actually works \u2014 about who holds power there and who does not. After a white police officer shot and killed Eric Logan, a black man, Buttigieg went home to face residents furious over years of police violence and over his earlier decision to demote the city\u2019s first black police chief. Other residents say that while his development push accomplished some good, its benefits do not always trickle down to the city\u2019s most vulnerable communities. Buttigieg may have torn down ramshackle old houses, but residents reportedly fear asbestos and lead poisoning from the demolitions, and many lots now stand empty.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t shit changed,\u201d one resident told CNBC in April. That may be what Mark Zuckerberg wants to hear, but it\u2019s at odds with the story Buttigieg tells about himself. There\u2019s a chasm between his brand and his record, and another between his brand and his platform, which for the most part rehashes familiar centrist policy. On health care, Buttigieg lauds choice as though choice by itself were a social good. Instead of Medicare for All, voters will get Medicare for All Who Want It, which leaves private insurance intact. In this way it resembles other policies put forward by other moderates. Rather than cancel student-loan debt for everyone, as Sanders has suggested, or for most people, as Warren has proposed, Buttigieg would limit relief. Graduates of programs that failed the federal government\u2019s gainful-employment rule would qualify, as would participants in his mooted expansion of national-service programs. But that\u2019s it. Buttigieg is relatively consistent. He hews closely to the technocratic wonkery he knows best and keeps raking in cash from the insurance, hospital, and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nI\u2019d say neoliberalism is the political-economic consensus that has governed the last forty years of policy in the US and UK. Its failure helped to produce the Trump moment. Now we have to replace it with something better. \u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) September 23, 2019\n\nIn Buttigieg, voters get a candidate who can define neoliberalism in a sentence, who will even say that he thinks it\u2019s a negative force in the world. But he has never explained what alternative he offers. Generational change, in the mayor\u2019s case, doesn\u2019t mean much. Voters will just get a younger version of a Democratic Party they already know.", "description": "Pete Buttigieg isn\u2019t pivoting.
