We really do want to hear from everybody. But we're starting to do that thing,\" Goldberg said, intertwining her fingers.\n\n\"I don't know what that means, this 'thing,'\" McCain said.\n\n\"It means you're talking over each other,\" Goldberg said.\n\n\"Well it's 'The View,'\" McCain said.\n\nAn exasperated-looking Goldberg then launched into a lecture directed at McCain.\n\n\"It is 'The View.' You know what, let me tell you something about 'The View.' This show has always had the ability to have different points of view, which we respect around the table,\" Goldberg said. \"And when we talk to each other, we also exhibit respect. So when I'm saying to you, 'Hold up, because we're not hearing each other.' I'm not trying to cut you off, I'm trying to get you heard.\"\n\nMcCain started talking again, but was quickly shut down by Goldberg, who cut to a commercial break.\n\n\"No, no,\" Goldberg said. \"That's what you're doing right now, we'll be back.\"\n\nSince joining the show in 2017, McCain, daughter of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, has been the center of multiple dust-ups with her co-stars and guests.\n\nLast month, she got into an argument with guest Pamela Anderson over Julian Assange, who Anderson is friends with. And in June, McCain called Behar a \"b----\" during a discussion about President Trump's re-election bid.", "description": "Goldberg cut to commercial when McCain wouldn't heed her request to stop talking over her and others on \"The View\" on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ashley Collman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db8a75e695b58493553681d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
