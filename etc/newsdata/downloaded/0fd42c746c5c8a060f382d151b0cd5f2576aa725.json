(Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nColumnist\n\nWhat do these things have in common: A bald eagle soaring through the sky. A crook reaching under the dashboard of a car. A body washing up on a beach.\n\nThe answer? They\u2019re all preludes to Things That Hollywood Gets Wrong.\n\nI\u2019ve been asking readers to share common things they notice in the media that strike them as incorrect.\n\n[Can you knit a quilt? Of course not. And Marco Polo didn\u2019t ride a llama to China.]\n\nGeorge Berkheimer of Laurel, Md., said that whenever he sees a bald eagle flying across a movie screen he waits \u201cwith dread.\u201d The image is invariably followed by the screech not of an eagle, but of a red-tailed hawk.\n\nThat annoys Jody Marshall of McLean, Va., too, who admits that the eagle\u2019s call is kind of wimpy.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the hawk-for-eagle swap that\u2019s commonplace. \u201cThe laughing kookaburra is another standard example,\u201d Jody wrote. \u201cNative to Australia, its maniacal call is used in scenes depicting African or South American jungles. Then there are the western birds used as ambient \u2018color\u2019 in scenes depicting the eastern United States, and vice versa. It bothers me when we don\u2019t value the natural world enough to portray it accurately.\u201d\n\nMike Briguglio of North Potomac, Md., finds the ease with which a character hot-wires a car \u2014 starting it without a key \u2014 laughable. Mike wrote: \u201cYou have not been able to pull some wires from under the dash and touch them together to start a car and be able to drive it for decades. Lame.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of cars, a reader named English Brent Taylor said he plays a little game whenever a person is depicted driving a car on TV. He looks to see if the car is in Park. \u201cYou know: the shift lever up high when looking in the windshield,\u201d Brent wrote. \u201cMaybe they just have different autos in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nPeter Quinn of Cabin John, Md., notices how often in TV and movies people get out of a taxicab before paying the driver.\n\n\u201cAny self-respecting cabbie would lock the doors before letting a passenger get out without handing the fare over first,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhenever Ken Herst of Springfield, Va., sees a mutilated corpse \u2014 on a TV show! \u2014 he awaits a familiar trope: the victim being identified \u201cthrough dental records.\u201d\n\nKen wrote: \u201cReally? I know there is a national DNA database and the national fingerprint database, but I am not familiar with a national dental records database. If they don\u2019t know who the victim is, how can they go to his or her dentist to get the dental records?\u201d\n\nMichael R. Dudley of Stafford, Va., spent 32 years in the U.S. Army. \u201cI tend to look closely at the uniforms, haircuts and hand salutes of actors on television and in movies,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is almost always something out of kilter, especially on dress uniforms. Hair is often too long and hand salutes are rendered in a sloppy fashion. After a career of doing all of these things correctly I\u2019m appalled at the apparent disregard for attention to detail.\u201d\n\nA reader named Lisa from Washington state agrees. She has a specific gripe with the Fox TV show \u201cThe Resident.\u201d It\u2019s a show she likes, but she feels the whole premise is wrong.\n\nThe character played by actor Matt Czuchry is supposed to be a doctor who gained experience in the Marine Corps, with deployments in war zones.\n\n\u201cHe has a huge tattoo of the Marine Corps slogan \u2018Death Before Dishonor\u2019 on his back,\u201d Lisa wrote. \u201cProblem is, the Marine Corps does not have its own medical staff. Navy corpsmen serve as medics to deployed Marine units, and their doctors are naval officers, not Marines.\u201d\n\nCaroline Nothwanger is a veterinarian in Virginia. Her blood pressure rises when she sees a doctor on a TV medical show don a stethoscope with the earpieces facing backward.\n\n\u201cThe earpieces should point forwards \u2014 toward the nose \u2014 so that they will direct sound down the ear canal,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey are a little harder to put on this way, but once you know it\u2019s wrong, you can\u2019t un-see it.\u201d\n\nWho knew?\n\nWell, probably Paula Refo, a registered nurse who lives in Warrenton, Va. She pointed out another medical reversal: \u201cIn medical shows, the oxygen tubing is often backward, behind the head rather than under the chin and around the ears.\u201d\n\nPaula figures they do this \u201cto make the person look more attractive.\u201d\n\nHmm. That does sound like something Hollywood might do.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Sorry, bald eagle.
