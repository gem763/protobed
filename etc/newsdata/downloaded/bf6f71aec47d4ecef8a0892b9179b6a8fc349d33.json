The launch is in tandem with New York\u2019s digital subscription product, also going live today, as well as a new network-wide navigation.\n\n\u201cThe nymag.com home screen has always been the purest distillation of New York\u2019s digital experimentation, expansion and expression \u2014 packing a dense visual punch and striving to capture the sense of serious fun inherent to our sprawling coverage,\u201d says New York Media\u2019s chief creative officer Ian Adelman. \u201cIn this new design, these sites are woven together in a way that demonstrates their common DNA, while also giving each of them space to be themselves. All of this happens in a layout that maintains elements of our hallmark layout density and exciting visual expression while introducing a bit more order and allowing for an even wider range of journalistic demeanor.\u201d\n\nEach iteration of the nymag.com home page has presented a new challenge, with more range to cover as new verticals are launched \u2014 most recently Intelligencer and the Strategist \u2014 and have developed stronger individual personalities. New York Media\u2019s digital audience continues to grow, with 45 million users in October across the network, up 40 percent over October 2017 (Google Analytics).", "description": "The launch is in tandem with New York\u2019s digital subscription product, also going live today, as well as a new network-wide navigation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2018/11/27/nymag-com-hp-2018-new.w1200.h630.jpg"}
