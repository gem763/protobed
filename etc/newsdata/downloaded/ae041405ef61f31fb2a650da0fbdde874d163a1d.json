How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if Clearwater Seafoods is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Clearwater Seafoods for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Clearwater Seafoods!\n\nTSX:CLR Historical Dividend Yield, September 3rd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 88% of Clearwater Seafoods's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. It's paying out most of its earnings, which limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate limited need for further capital within the business, or highlight a commitment to paying a dividend.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Of the free cash flow it generated last year, Clearwater Seafoods paid out 37% as dividends, suggesting the dividend is affordable. It's positive to see that Clearwater Seafoods's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nIs Clearwater Seafoods's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Clearwater Seafoods has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. Clearwater Seafoods has net debt of 5.00 times its EBITDA, which implies meaningful risk if interest rates rise of earnings decline.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 1.81 times its interest expense, Clearwater Seafoods's interest cover is starting to look a bit thin. High debt and weak interest cover are not a great combo, and we would be cautious of relying on this company's dividend while these metrics persist.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Clearwater Seafoods's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Clearwater Seafoods Incorporated (TSE:CLR) a good dividend stock?
