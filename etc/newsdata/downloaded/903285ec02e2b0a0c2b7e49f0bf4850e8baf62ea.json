He shrinks down and makes his way into Thanos\u2019s mouth. Then it\u2019s just a waiting game. As soon as the Hulk makes it to the urethra he turns his suit off,\u2019 one fan argued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Thanos\u2019s manhood explodes as a blood-covered Hulk emerges from the bloody mess. Thanos falls down unconscious and slowly bleeds to death.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s all quite gory, right?\n\nWhile producers of the film might have laughed off the theory, Paul was more keen for it.\n\nAnt-Man to the rescue (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nThe star recently appeared on First We Feast\u2019s Hot Ones promoting his new Netflix series Living With Yourself.\n\nBecause you can\u2019t get an Avenger in a room and not ask about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the star was pressed on his thoughts on the intriguing theory.\n\nPaul paused, with a deep sigh, so thoughtful, and replied: \u2018I consider it a lost opportunity.\u2019\n\nThe star had previously shared his thoughts on the whole \u2018going into Thanos\u2019s butt\u2019 thing, wondering why it had to be that particular orifice.\n\n\u2018A lot of people have asked me recently if I shrink down and go\u2026 into Thanos, in a certain orifice, and then grow giant size. But why not the ear or the nose? Why does it have to be [that]?\u2019 he said earlier this year during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show, making a fair point.\n\nBefore the release, Executive Producer Trinh Tran told Metro.co.uk she had seen your theories and while she admitted there are some that come close to revealing the ending of the film, this butt-tastic one wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018One I recently read has been interesting, I won\u2019t say much but it involved Thanos and Ant-Man,\u2019 Trinh said in April.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s crazy, but it\u2019s a lot of fun to see how people are coming up with crazy theories.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
