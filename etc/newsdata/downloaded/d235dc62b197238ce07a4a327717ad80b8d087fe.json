This stuff is moving at hundreds of thousands of miles an hour, but when you look at them over the years they barely move.\n\n'That's the vastness of space.'\n\nThe arm of the spiral galaxy (the blue) has been twisted out of shape and has also produced huge explosions of stars (one in centre)\n\nThe two galaxies became entangled between 100 and 200 million years ago, and began morphing each other's shape.\n\nA ring and two long tails of stars emerged, creating a bridge between the two galaxies.\n\nRudy Pohl, 69, of Ottowa in Canada, amateur astrophotographer with his Sky-Watcher HEQ5 telescope\n\nThis bridge acts as a pipeline, funnelling material from the smaller galaxy towards its larger companion.\n\nThat material feeds bursts of star formation concentrated at the bright galactic centre.\n\nRudy is one of 'thousands' of astro-enthusiasts around the world who use publicly available data from the Hubble Legacy Archive website to produce pristine celestial images.\n\nHe added: 'The NASA photographers shoot the image with a red filter for a few hours at a time. They then do the same with a green and blue filter.\n\n'The raw image is very grainy and blurry. So I meticulously assign the different tones of red, blue and green to produce the final picture.\n\n'NASA astrophotographers often assign the colours themselves. When they do, the ultimate goal is getting your image to look just like theirs.'\n\nRudy, once a keen wildlife photographer, became interested in 'deep space' astrophotography four years ago after he fell ill and was forced to sell his cameras.\n\nNASA's Hubble Space Telescope was used to capture the best and sharpest look to date at Comet Borisov, the second ever-known interstellar object to visit our solar system\n\nEarlier this year Hubble revealed a new image of a 'smiling galaxy cluster'. Taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) shows a galaxy cluster officially known as SDSS J0952+3434.\n\nHe added: 'Creating these shots is a great way of getting involved in space photography if you can't take the pictures yourself.\n\nNASA says the 'mouth' is created by a trick of the light.\n\n'Many people live in cities where the light pollution is too intense for photography, so assigning the colours from the Hubble data is a great alternative.'\n\nRudy and his wife became pastors forty years ago after having a 'spiritual conversion' experience.\n\nHe has since left the church but still holds strong religious - and scientific - beliefs.\n\nThis gives him a 'extremely unique' perspective on space.\n\nHe said: 'I'm a very strong believer in evolution and all aspects of science. At the same time, I was a pastor and I believe in a creator.\n\nA mosaic image made of nearly 7,500 photos taken by NASA's Hubble Telescope (pictured) is 'the largest and most comprehensive history book of the universe', say scientist.\n\n'It gives me a wonderful view of creation.\n\n'I'm not the only person interested in space who also believes in God.\n\n'NASA has a whole group of these people who are top flight scientists and also Christians.'\n\nNGC 7714 galaxy was discovered by astronomer John Herschel on 18 September 1830.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is an international project between the European Space Agency and NASA.", "description": "NASA's Hubble Telescope captured the scene, where gravity twisted starburst galaxy's spiral arms out of shape and triggered exploding stars -  now painstakingly recoloured by an astrophotographer.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/10/19875978-0-image-a-4_1571389664492.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
