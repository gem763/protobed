The world\u2019s two biggest economies are approaching an accord that could lift most or all U.S. tariffs, according to people familiar with the talks. Prices were also supported by Baker Hughes data that showed working oil rigs in America fell to the lowest level since May, while OPEC output declined again.\n\nOil has rallied about 24 percent this year as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies -- known as OPEC+ -- cut production while American sanctions on Venezuela and Iran restrict supplies further.\n\n\u201cGrowing compliance with the OPEC+ deal and slowing rig count in the U.S. should remain fairly supportive for the oil market,\u201d said Warren Patterson, senior commodities strategist at ING Bank NV.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate for April delivery rose as much as 62 cents to $56.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and traded at $56.26 as of 1:20 p.m. London time. Prices fell last week following weaker-than-expected reports on U.S. factory orders and consumer sentiment.\n\nfor May settlement was at $65.84 a barrel, up 77 cents, on the London-based ICE (NYSE: ) Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude\u2019s premium over WTI for the same month widened to $8.94.\n\nThe drop in American oil rigs, by 10 to 843 last week, came as explorers were chastened by a near 40 percent collapse in prices late last year. In the Permian, the nation\u2019s largest shale play, rigs fell by seven to 466, also the lowest since May.\n\nNabors Industries Ltd (NYSE: )., the world\u2019s largest owner of land drilling rigs, said customers accounting for more than a third of the machines deployed across the U.S. plan to trim activity by about 3 percent this year.\n\nOPEC Output\n\nOPEC\u2019s production slumped last month as key members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates delivered all -- and in some cases more -- of the cuts they had pledged under a deal between the group and its partners. Non-member Russia pumped the equivalent of 11.336 million barrels a day, down 82,000 barrels a day from the October baseline, Bloomberg calculations show.\n\n\u201cThere continues to be very strong support for oil prices on the back of OPEC reducing their production,\u201d said Howie Lee, a Singapore-based economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. \u201cAlso, if the U.S. and China manage to resolve their key differences, then we can raise the oil demand a few notches. I think there is hope.\u201d\n\nSubstantial progress has been made in talks with the U.S., a spokesman for China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress said before legislative meetings this week. People familiar with the discussions earlier said a deal is likely as long as Beijing sticks to pledges ranging from protecting intellectual property to buying U.S. products.", "description": "Oil Rises as U.S.-China Trade Deal Nears While Supply Tightens", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic86d83222e0f733e085919f74185727ee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-04"}
