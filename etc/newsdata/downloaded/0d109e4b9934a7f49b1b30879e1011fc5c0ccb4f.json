Burroughs issued her decision Tuesday, saying \"the Court finds no persuasive documentary evidence of any racial animus or conscious prejudice against Asian Americans.\" In the decision, Burroughs said that while Harvard's admissions program is \"not perfect,\" \"ensuring diversity at Harvard relies, in part, on race conscious admissions.\"\n\nIn a statement, Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow said, \"Today we reaffirm the importance of diversity \u2014 and everything it represents to the world.\"\n\nThe plaintiff, advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), accused Harvard of considering race too much and discriminating against Asian American applicants. SFFA President Edward Blum said in a statement that he was disapointed by the ruling and, \"SFFA will appeal this decision to the 1st Court of Appeals and, if necessary, to the U.S Supreme Court.\"\n\nSupporters of affirmative action fear that if this case makes it to the nation's highest court, race-conscious admissions could be eliminated.\n\n\"This has been kind of a beacon of civil rights policies in higher education that helped to transform student demographics, especially at elite institutions,\" said Mitchell Chang, an education professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nAssociate education law professor Liliana Garces co-authored an amicus brief supporting Harvard's admissions practices leading up to the trial.\n\n\"I think what this case represents is a very concerted effort to bring the question of race-conscious admissions back to the Supreme Court,\" said Garces, who teaches at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nMany colleges that already consider race in admissions have been closely watching the Harvard lawsuit. \"It matters a lot what the Harvards of the world do,\" said Tiffany Jones, director of higher education policy at the Education Trust.\n\nAccording to Jones, Tuesday's ruling might encourage those schools to stay the course.\n\n\"This decision helps to reinforce this idea that there are legal ways to incorporate a racial-equity focus in the efforts of higher education leaders to create opportunities and support the success of underrepresented students of color.\"\n\nSFFA, led by conservative strategist Edward Blum, sued Harvard back in 2014, alleging that the school discriminates against Asian American applicants in the admissions process. The organization says Harvard uses \"racial balancing\" \u2014 which is illegal \u2014 to curate its student body and holds Asian American students to a higher standard than others in the admissions process. (Blum was also behind a lawsuit against the University of Texas at Austin, challenging its affirmative action program. The Supreme Court sided with the University of Texas in 2016.)\n\nHarvard denied the group's claims of discrimination, presenting its own evidence to the contrary during a three-week trial in fall 2018. Harvard uses what it calls a \"whole person review\" in its admissions process, considering many qualities about each candidate. Testimony from Harvard representatives, including the admissions dean, provided a window into the school's normally mysterious admissions system.\n\nHarvard only accepts a small percentage of its applicants, but most American colleges and universities accept a majority of those who apply. And while Harvard is among a large group of selective schools that consider race as one factor in admissions, most schools don't take race into account.", "description": "The advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions says it will appeal the decision, which means the fate of race-conscious admissions could once again end up in the hands of the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Clare Lombardo", "Elissa Nadworny"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/06/10/gettyimages-479706478_wide-286acc5138f0a94dc4cdf86fb2b879ce8a34c65f.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
