She likened the payments to Yang's \"freedom dividend,\" a $12,000-a-year universal basic income he has pledged to provide to all US citizens over 18 to offset job losses he says will be brought about by automation.\n\n\"Sounds a lot like Yang's 'freedom dividend' platform doesn't it?\" Watkins wrote, adding: \"Rather than governing our way into a sustainable economy, Yang's plan absolves the government from overseeing companies that could render countless workers obsolete.\"\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost, Yang disputed Watkins' allegations.\n\n\"As a CEO I made decisions about hiring and firing singularly based on performance,\" he said.\n\n\"Kimberly Watkins' facts about her break from Manhattan Prep are inaccurate. During my more than a decade as CEO, I have worked with many women, married and otherwise, and value their work and dedication as important to the success of any institution.\n\n\"If I were the kind of leader who would do the sort of thing described by Ms. Watkins, I would never enjoy a whiff of success. Women leaders are vital to any company or organization, and I have been very fortunate and grateful to have worked with many of them in my career.\"\n\nManhattan Prep was acquired by Kaplan in 2009, and Yang departed as president in 2012.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Yang has spoken of the need to address how gender discrimination leads to pay inequality.\n\nBusiness Insider has attempted to reach Watkins for additional comment.\n\nManhattan Prep did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNOW WATCH: A year after Armenia's 250,000-person revolution, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan explains what comes next for the country", "description": "Kimberley Watkins worked for Yang when he was a CEO in 2007.
