Is. Time. From Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Mandalorian, check out basically everything coming to #DisneyPlus in the U.S. on November 12.\n\n\n\nPre-order in the U.S. at https://t.co/wJig4STf4P today: https://t.co/tlWvp23gLF pic.twitter.com/0q3PTuaDWT \u2014 Disney+ (@disneyplus) October 14, 2019\n\nDisney has faced a few bumps in the road en route to becoming the behemoth it is today. At the beginning of 1941, after \u201cPinocchio\u201d and \u201cFantasia\u201d flopped (only to be revived years later), the company was $3 million in debt. A cartoonist strike later that year certainly didn\u2019t help matters. To remain afloat, the company produced and distributed U.S. propaganda, funded by the government, before finally recovering with 1950\u2032s \u201cCinderella.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor about two more decades, the company continued making children movies like these, but it hit a wall in the 1970s.\n\nThe company spent the early part of the decade pumping out animal-based fare like \u201cThe Barefoot Executive\u201d (about Kurt Russell and his chimpanzee, who can predict which television shows will be hits), \u201cMillion Dollar Duck\u201d (which is about a family with a duck who lays golden eggs), \u201cJustin Morgan had a Horse\u201d (about one of the first breeds of horse developed in America and the owner, a guy named Justin), \u201cThe Biscuit Eater\u201d (about two young dudes and their dog, who is frustratingly named Moreover) and \u201cThe Bears and I\u201d (about a Vietnam vet and three bears living on an island). There\u2019s clearly some nostalgia for these, as a DVD copy of that last one is going for $229.95 on Amazon, even though as Disney made clear today, it will also be included on Disney+.\n\nFor the most part, these movies were not good. In fact, most of these movies were very, very bad. \u201cMillion Dollar Duck\u201d was reportedly one of three movies critic Gene Siskel ever walked out on. His partner-in-criticism Roger Ebert wrote this incredible paragraph about it:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWalt Disney\u2019s \u2018$1,000,000 Duck\u2019 is one of the most profoundly stupid movies I\u2019ve ever seen. It is a movie about a duck that gets an overdose of radiation and starts laying golden eggs. It is also about the people who won the duck, and about how greed and avarice appear in their lives, and about the lesson in love and understanding that the father gets when his son runs away with the duck and becomes trapped on a ladder between the ledges of two tall buildings, and about how the father gets a fair trial from the American judiciary system.\u201d\n\nMore importantly to Disney, these movies failed to rake in as much money as its animated films during this period, such as \u201cRobin Hood\u201d and \u201cThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.\u201d At the same time, special-effects-laden thrillers like \u201cJaws\u201d and \u201cStar Wars\u201d were dominating the box office. So Disney decided to break bad and follow the trend by turning its attention to the decidedly un-Disney genres of horror and science fiction.\n\nThe most notable of these films was \u201cThe Black Hole,\u201d the most expensive movie Disney had made up until that point, costing $20 million. It was also the company\u2019s first to earn a then-scandalous PG rating. The space opera, which centers on a spaceship encountering a black hole, was meant to be Disney\u2019s version of \u201cStar Wars,\u201d a property it would later acquire.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCritics didn\u2019t like it. Ebert wrote that it \u201ctakes us all the way to the rim of space only to bog us down in a talky melodrama whipped up out of mad scientists and haunted houses.\u201d Cultural critic Jason Heller, who saw the film in theaters when he was 7 years old and expected a more kid-friendly \u201cStar Wars,\u201d wrote years later: \u201cWhat I got instead was a slow-paced, sporadically disorienting film that ends with the human villain merging with the robot villain. After that, this hybrid man-bot is consigned \u2014 with no ambiguity whatsoever \u2014 to the fire and brimstone of the biblical underworld. Hell. Literally.\"\n\nStill, it did well enough, earning $36 million at the box office revenue in addition to revenue from merchandise, as well as Oscars nods for cinematography and special effects.\n\nAnd it\u2019s certainly stuck with some people. Neil deGrasse Tyson railed against the movie to TMZ for nearly two minutes in 2014, calling it \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201cone of the worst movies ever.\u201d \u201cThey not only got none of the physics right about falling into a black hole. Had they gotten it right, it would have been a vastly more interesting movie. Somebody must have decided \u2018I know better than the scientists.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo the company continued down that road, making movies like \u201cDragonslayer,\u201d \u201cTron,\u201d \u201cSomething Wicked This Way Comes\u201d and \u201cThe Watcher in the Woods,\u201d a straight-up ghost story that, according to Nerdist, was accompanied by a warning to parents to \u201cpre-screen the picture for pre-teens. It is not for small children!\u201d\n\nDisney knew it had to make adult-themed fare to compete, but it also knew that the Disney brand was an issue. As Richard Berger, the then-president of the company\u2019s film division, told the New York Times in 1984: \u201cAudiences don\u2019t know who made \u2018Star Wars\u2019 or \u2018Raiders of the Lost Ark.\u2019 They do know who made \u2018TRON\u2019 and \u2018The Apple Dumpling Gang.\u2019 If you put Disney\u2019s name on top of \u2018Emmanuelle,\u2019 and had 'X'-rated at the bottom, people would say, \u2018We can bring our children.\u2019 ''\n\nTo distance the hallowed brand name from these newer films, Disney created Touchstone Pictures. That\u2019s the main reason that when we think of Disney today, we generally remember the animated classics and hokey live-action kid flicks.\n\nThese days, of course, Disney seems to own just about everything. And as the company made clear with its massive Twitter thread, nearly all of these things will be on its streaming service. It\u2019s been four decades, but finally \u201cBlack Hole\u201d and \u201cBambi\u201d will once again live side-by-side in perfect harmony.\n\nAD", "description": "From animal-based movies to straight-up horror, Disney had a weird run there.", "authors": ["Travis M.
