That compares with 8 in 10 for generation X and just under three-quarters for baby boomers.\n\nMillennials\u2019 understanding of credit scores \u2013 the numeric value used to predict how likely you are to repay debt \u2013 also has vastly improved in the last two years, jumping from 57% in 2017. That figure was 74% for gen X and 85% for boomers in 2017.\n\nAshley Matthias, tattoo artist at Bulletproof Tiger Tattoo, speaks to Reuters in Manchester, New Hampshire.

In the current survey, almost 2 in 3 millennials said checking their score helped them make smarter financial decisions.\n\n\u201cMore people are taking the proactive step of checking their credit score,\u201d said Stefanie O\u2019Connell, a personal finance blogger, author and speaker in a conversation with Yahoo Finance. \u201cPeople want to assess their long-term goals, properly manage their money, and build a better life around their priorities.\u201d\n\nMillennials are also more likely to be at the age when credit has become more important in their lives. Older generations who have accomplished these milestones may not need to open new credit obligations as often.\n\n\u201cWhen you're getting into a stage of life where you're making major life decisions,\u201d O\u2019Connell said, \u201clike buying a home, or getting married, and joining finances, or leasing a car or any other milestone in which your credit is going to become really important, it's so helpful to have that information available to you and you can make better choices.\u201d\n\nAccess to credit scores\n\nIt\u2019s easier now than ever to actually get ahold of your credit score. Tools like Discover\u2019s Credit Scorecard \u2013 launched in 2016 \u2013 allow both Discover customers and non-customers to check their credit score for free and automatically sends updates by email every 30 days.\n\nMillennial stock blogger and trader Rachel Fox is asked to take a picture with a fan after speaking to a group of investors, tech nerds and stock traders at StockTwits annual Stocktoberfest in Coronado, California.

Sites like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame along with the major credit reporting bureaus also offer Americans a peek at their credit scores for free.\n\n\u201cThis data really shows us is the importance of accessibility and tools,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\n\nCredit score confusion\n\nIn spite of the increased awareness and information accessibility, the general population is still confused about the factors that actually make up a credit score.\n\nAlmost a quarter of respondents (23%) in Discover\u2019s survey incorrectly said that checking their credit score negatively affects it. To a lesser extent, 18% erroneously believed that income has an impact on their score, while 15% mistakenly thought employment history also affects it.\n\nTo make it easier to understand, O\u2019Connell suggests thinking of credit health as \u201cthe habits that you practice\u201d regularly like monitoring your credit report for errors or suspicious activity, making on-time bill payments, maintaining low balances and limiting new credit to only when you need it.\n\nAs for your credit score, O\u2019Connell said to consider it as \u201cthe outcome of that habit\u201d and an important indicator of what's going on on a deeper level in our credit health.\n\nStephanie is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
