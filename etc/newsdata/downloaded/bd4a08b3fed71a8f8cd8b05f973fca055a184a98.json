It sets the stage for an alternate history with sweeping ripple effects on everything from women\u2019s rights and the environment to the Vietnam War.\n\n\u201cThe competition with the Soviet Union moves out into space, the United States gets out of Vietnam early to commit more resources to the space program,\u201d said executive producer Ronald D. Moore, who also created the series.\n\n\u201cSociety shifts, and along the way politics and history shift to take the U.S. and the world on a more positive and optimistic path,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d which launches on the Apple TV+ streaming service on Friday, envisages a world where women, including black women, become astronauts and engines of social change decades before they did in real life, the Soviet Union never invades Afghanistan, and billions more dollars are poured into technology.\n\n\u201cResearch into solar technology and battery technology starts to move clean energy forwards decades before it was a real thing in the United States. The fossil fuel industry starts to collapse so climate change is less of a pressing issue,\u201d Moore said.\n\nApple is launching Apple TV+ in more than 100 markets for an initial $5 a month with eight original shows, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a behind-the-scenes television drama, and sci-fi series \u201cSee.\u201d Its initial catalog is dwarfed by Netflix Inc, Amazon Studios and Walt Disney Co\u2019s Disney+ streaming service, which launches on Nov. 15.\n\nMoore is known for his work on sci-fi series like \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d and \u201cStar Trek: Deep Space Nine\u201d but said \u201cFor All Mankind\u201d could not be more different.\n\n\u201cThere are no aliens coming down, we aren\u2019t going to have a time vortex and all that kind of stuff ... This show has a very optimistic outlook,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 10-episode drama series is as ambitious as it is global, with a diverse cast and also a strong immigration storyline featuring a Mexican girl and her father. They cross the U.S. border and both become part of NASA.\n\n\u201cWe become a valuable part of society as immigrants instead of just being a nuisance or taking someone else\u2019s jobs. In this show, we are trying to give an optimistic message in terms of immigrants not being treated as second-class citizens,\u201d said Arturo del Puerto, who plays the Mexican dad Octavio Rosales.\n\nApple and the producers declined to give production costs but Moore called it a high-budget show and said Apple had been \u201cgenerous with its resources.\u201d\n\nMeticulous attention was paid to recreating NASA\u2019s Mission Control room in the late 1960s from the original architect\u2019s plans, while a team of space historians and former astronauts and administrators acted as consultants to the writers, actors and set builders.\n\n\u201cThis is a science fiction idea, an alternate history, but other than that everything else in the show is played in a very real key,\u201d said Moore.", "description": "Imagine a world where Neil Armstrong was not the first man on the moon and the Soviet Union won the space race instead.", "authors": ["Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
