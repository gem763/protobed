Min Dhariwal is spending his summer getting to know ordinary people doing remarkable things. Do you have a story that should be told? Let us know by email at whatsyourstory@CBC.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarisa Staub\u2019s passion for soccer has taken her around the world.\n\nShe recently returned from her first year of professional soccer in the northern Portuguese city of Braga.\n\n\"Portugal was absolutely amazing,\u201d said Staub, sitting on the front steps of her parent\u2019s Mill Woods home where she\u2019s staying for the summer.\n\nThe 23-year-old was the only Canadian on the 25-member Sporting Clube de Braga soccer team, which included players from Portugal, the United States, Brazil, Cameroon, and Nigeria.\n\nA collection of photos laid out by the Staub family showcases her championship win in Portugal.

I'm just so proud of myself and so lucky to have people who have supported me along this way to get me there.\u201d\n\nStaub\u2019s journey started when she was four years old, playing community league soccer in Mill Woods.\n\n\u201cI wanted to live, breathe, eat, play soccer all the time, whether it was [against] older people, girls, boys, I just wanted everything to do with soccer,\" she said.\n\nAt age 11, she joined Southwest United and excelled at club soccer under technical director Tomasz Janas.\n\n\u201cShe had an enormous amount of talent,\u201d said Janas, who watched his star player move up the ranks.\n\nTomasz Janas has coached Staub since she was 11 years old.

She was a vital part of the silver-medal winning Canadian team at the U-17 CONCACAF championship in 2012.\n\nJanas credits Staub\u2019s success to her work ethic, which he describes as \u201coff the charts.\u201d\n\n\"It's not something that was taught by me,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt came obviously from the environment where she grew up. Larisa was not the most talented athlete, Larisa worked for everything extremely hard. Things did not come easy for her, she did not have an easy road.\"\n\nHer success with the Canadian National team landed Staub a full scholarship to Arizona State University, where she played four years with the Sun Devils.\n\n\n\nAlong the way, her parents, Jeff and Shauna Staub, have made countless sacrifices to allow their daughter to play everywhere from Azerbaijan to Guatemala.\n\n\n\nStaub credits her parents support with helping her get to where she is today.

She always made me laugh in the car and that's what got us through.\u201d\n\nA moment the family will never forget came this past spring, when the Staubs watched from the stands, surrounded by screaming fans, as their daughter\u2019s team won a league championship in Portugal.\n\n\"It was incredible watching 5,000 to 7,000 people actually watching the game, and how the women's sport is evolving,\u201d said Jeff Staub.\n\n\u201cIt was just one of those sweet moments that I had with them,\u201d gushed Staub as she talked about her parents. \u201cThey've travelled all around the world to like see me play and that's like unconditional love and support at its finest, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I was five years old again, at my kick around soccer game but here I am playing in front of thousands of people, and you just see them cheering. It just warms your heart seeing that and again to have supportive parents like that, it just makes everything so much better.\u201d\n\nWatch Staub and her parents talk about the championship!\n\nWhile she\u2019s at home visiting this month, Staub is staying in shape and helping the next generation realize their dreams as co-coach with Southwest United\u2019s under-15 girls team.\n\n\"You can definitely tell how serious she is about it and how much she cares for the sport,\u201d said Fiona Davidson, captain of the team.\n\n\u201cIt really feeds into our love for the sport and stuff like that, so it's really amazing to have her here.\u201d\n\nGoing back to her roots, Staub is now a co-coach for Southwest United, helping the next generation of soccer players realize their dreams.

Her agent is currently working on locking down a deal with a team in the European Champions League. Some of her options are with teams in Germany, Spain, France or Kazakhstan.\n\nThere\u2019s even talk about taking a shot at the Canadian Olympic team, and the Canadian World Cup team for 2023.\n\n\"If I get a good year under my belt again I'd look forward to possibly playing in the Olympics,\u201d Staub said. \u201cThat's a huge dream of mine, why not accomplish it right?\u201d\n\nJanas believes his star pupil can reach that next level.\n\n\"I believe if Canada doesn't take a look at her it's going to be a Canadian loss, it's not going to be her loss,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it doesn't matter where she's going to go. Playing in Champions League, in Juventus, or Lyon, she goes to Spain, or Barcelona, whatever team is next, she will bring an enormous amount of value to the team.\u201d", "description": "Larisa Staub began playing soccer at the age of 4 in Mill Woods.
