However, if the north West isn\u2019t for you then Lincoln in the east Midlands could also be a viable option.\n\nOxford (pictured above) was found to be out of reach for those looking to get on the property ladder\n\nCambridge (pictured above) was also out of reach as well as Hove, York and Brighton\n\nPlaces that ranked in the lowest affordability included Warwick, Guilford and Woking, with researchers finding that no homes were in reach for first-time buyers.\n\nThis is while Oxford, Watford, Brighton, Hove, Cambridge and York were also out of reach for those looking to get their foot on the ladder.\n\nFor those who are looking to get savvy with their pennies, the best return on investment came from places such as Nuneaton and Bedworth, where property values had gone up by 11 per cent to \u00a3179,995.\n\nThis is while people in Ipswich saw the most opportunity over the past year with the percentage of homes in reach in the town rose 6 percent to 88 per cent.\n\nThere was also good news for city workers looking to commute from outside the capital.\n\nDespite places on the commuter belt such as Guilford and Woking scoring low, Reading actually saw a 6 per cent rise in the number of properties affordable for first time buyers.\n\nBack to the north West and it was the same for those looking to live within commuting distance to Manchester.\n\nThose looking to commute into Manchester could chose places such as Wigan (Manchester Piccadilly station pictured)\n\n80 per cent of homes in Oldham (pictured above), which is just outside Manchester, were classed as affordable.\n\nWigan and Oldham saw 90 per cent and 80 per cent of homes being classes as affordable, while just 61 per cent were affordable in Manchester.\n\nHartlepool and Southampton were also deemed as affordable options.\n\nThe average salary for full-time workers in the UK is \u00a335,423, while it's \u00a312,083 for those in part-time employment.\n\nCommenting on the research Post Office Money's Ross Hunter said: \u201cWhile we may be seeing the first indications of a \u2018buyer\u2019s market\u2019, we still know that saving for and ultimately purchasing a home is a difficult process.\n\n\"Finding which areas are most affordable in cities local to you is key to making a personal plan of action.\"", "description": "Those looking to make their first steps onto the property the ladder in the UK should consider buying in the north West as new figures reveal the best places to buy a first home.
