REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nThe announcement came after the company\u2019s board said on Wednesday it had created a new permanent safety committee to oversee development, manufacturing and operation of its aircraft and services in the aftermath of two fatal 737 MAX crashes.\n\nIt was not clear who from Boeing will testify.\n\nSeparately, deputy Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Dan Elwell told a U.S. House committee hearing the agency currently was not seeking additional funding for safety efforts, but that could change depending on various reviews.\n\nBoth the House and Senate have proposed boosting spending on aviation safety spending but have not reached agreement. Elwell said the FAA was considering creating an innovation office.\n\nElwell also denied any rift between U.S. and foreign aviation regulators over the 737 MAX. \u201cWe have to get it right and we have to get it right globally,\u201d Elwell said.\n\nThe committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Roger Wicker, said he was happy to see Boeing had released long-awaited recommendations and looks forward to learning more about the recommendations \u201cand other conclusions Boeing has made at the aviation safety hearing I plan to call very soon.\u201d\n\nBoeing declined to comment Wednesday.\n\nLast week, the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee asked Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg to testify on Oct. 30 about the grounded 737 MAX involved in two deadly crashes since October 2018 that killed 346 people.\n\nThe panel\u2019s chair, Representative Peter DeFazio, also asked John Hamilton, the chief engineer of Boeing\u2019s commercial airplanes division, to testify. Boeing said last week it was studying the invitation.\n\nA spokeswoman for the House panel said Wednesday no response had been received from Boeing.\n\nEarlier this month DeFazio asked Muilenburg to make several employees available for interviews as part of a congressional probe into the design, development and certification of 737 MAX aircraft.\n\nBoeing has said it hopes the plane can resume flights early in the fourth quarter but still has a series of steps to complete before the 737 MAX can return to service, including submitting a pre-production version of a software update, FAA chief Steve Dickson told Reuters last week.\n\nIt remains uncertain when Boeing will conduct a certification test flight, a step needed before its best-selling plane can fly again. Dickson said once that flight occurs the FAA will need a month before it can allow flights to resume unless something unforeseen arises.\n\nSome government officials have said they do not believe Boeing will conduct the certification flight until at least mid-October. Asked if there are at least several weeks of work to be done before that flight can occur, Dickson said he thought that was a \u201cfair statement\u201d but did not want to set a specific date.", "description": "Boeing Co is expected to testify at an upcoming U.S. Senate Commerce Committee hearing on aviation safety, a spokeswoman for the panel said Wednesday.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433815077&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1JU", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
