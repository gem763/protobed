Tall riders might be wise to look towards the bigger 1200 Scrambler, but being of average height, I didn\u2019t find the accommodation overly cramped.\n\nIn rush-hour traffic, I found the Speed Twin to be extremely manageable \u2013 it could slip through narrow gaps between cars, while the prodigious low-end torque enabled it to clear the traffic effortlessly.\n\nAlthough the torque kicks in almost immediately, the bike doesn\u2019t seem to run out of breath: it just keeps accelerating in gear after gear until wind resistance threatens to blow you right off the slab seat.\n\nKey features\n\nThe unrelenting acceleration is locomotive-like, but this bike is a jet fighter rather than a steam engine: it speeds into curves with a sure-footedness that a well-heeled gentleman rider might find a tad unseemly, if not downright disconcerting.\n\nThe Speed Twin features a full suite of rider-focused technology which includes the obligatory three riding modes, Sport, Road and Rain, ABS brakes and switchable traction control.\n\nImage: Triumph\n\nIt also boasts an LED headlight with daytime running light and LED rear light and indicators. The analogue twin clocks incorporate a digital menu system accessed by the handlebar mounted scroll button.\n\nKey features include riding mode setting, gear position indicator, average and current fuel consumption and range to empty.\n\nFor Triumph aficionados the Speed Twin moniker holds a special place: it was used from 1938 to 1966 on a 500cm\u00b3 bike that became the mould from which all the successful then-modern British twins were cast.\n\nImage: Triumph\n\nWhile the modern iteration may not exactly 'change the face of motorcycling' as its progenitor was predicted to do (and, in fact, did), it does a credible job of turning back the clock to give us a glimpse of what motorcycling used to be like, without sacrificing modern safety, convenience and performance. It is, in short, yesterday revived and improved beyond measure.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nManufacturer: Triumph\n\nModel: Speed Twin\n\nEngine\n\nType: Liquid cooled, 8 valve, SOHC, 270\u00b0 crank angle parallel twin\n\nDisplacement: 1 200cm\u00b3\n\nMaximum Power: 71.5kW @ 6 750 rpm\n\nMaximum Torque: 112Nm @ 4 950 rpm\n\nFuel supply system: Multipoint sequential electronic fuel injection\n\nFuel type: Petrol, Premium Unleaded\n\nFuel consumption: 4.8l/100km\n\nTransmission\n\nType: 6-speed sequential\n\nFinal drive: Chain\n\nDimensions\n\nOverall length x width x height (mm): 1 430 X 807 X 1 110\n\nKerb weight: 196kg\n\nCapacities\n\nSeating: 2\n\nFuel tank: 14.5 L\n\nBrakes\n\nFront: Twin 305mm discs, Brembo 4-piston fixed calipers, ABS\n\nRear: Single 220mm disc, Nissin 2-piston floating caliper, ABS\n\nSuspension\n\nFront: 41mm cartridge forks, 120mm travel\n\nRear: Twin shocks with adjustable preload, 120mm rear wheel travel\n\nWheels & Tyres\n\nWheel, front: Cast aluminium alloy 7-spoke 17 x 3.5in\n\nWheel, rear: Cast aluminium alloy 7-spoke 17 x 5in\n\nTyre, front: 120/70 ZR17\n\nTyre, rear: 160/60 ZR17\n\nPrice: R184 000", "description": "Wheels24 bike correspondent Dries van der Walt takes an in-depth look at the Triumph Speed Twin, a modern bike that visually resembles a classic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9364/5a310cf4d8594edcbdc574b808f67c7f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
