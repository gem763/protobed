Both were incredible tonight.\n\n\u201cNico showed incredible personality after what happened in previous game [a mistake that gifted Norwich a goal on Saturday]. We need another solution \u2013 Rodri or Kyle [Walker] maybe because they cannot play every game at their age.\n\n\u201cFernandinho can play in any position but it is impossible for them to play every few days. The next options are Eric Garc\u00eda and Taylor Harwood\u2011Bellis and they are teenagers.\u201d\n\nFernandinho\u2019s inclusion was one of four changes from Norwich. The others were the Silvas \u2013 Bernardo and David \u2013 who were replaced by Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez, plus Sergio Ag\u00fcero, replaced by Gabriel Jesus.\n\nLu\u00eds Castro\u2019s Shakhtar side was as expected, lining up in their familiar 4-2\u20113\u20111 with J\u00fanior Moraes, one of the Ukrainian team\u2019s five Brazilians, the lone striker. Within seconds of kick-off Rodri managed to miss with a header when scoring appeared easier, Serhiy Bolbat having fouled Raheem Sterling along City\u2019s left.\n\nAfter that, the visitors found a killer fluidity, the superb Ilkay G\u00fcndogan creating their opener. De Bruyne won a tackle on the edge of the area and when the ball found Gabriel Jesus, G\u00fcndogan smacked it off Andriy Pyatov\u2019s right post and Mahrez was there to turn home a first goal of the season.\n\nThis did not tame the home side, though. Instead they came at City in waves that had a concerned Guardiola prowling his technical area. When Taison nutmegged Rodri he tore forward and slid the ball to J\u00fanior Moraes. The noise in the stadium surged as the No 10 pulled the trigger but Ederson\u2019s save kept City\u2019s lead intact.\n\nIt was about to be doubled, and this was City at their best. Rodri pinged a pass to Mahrez whose control was instant. He moved forward, found G\u00fcndogan making a sweetly timed run, and the No 8 made no mistake.\n\nThe half ended with Sterling setting up Mahrez, though his effort ballooned over, before a late scare for City was ended when Fernandinho blocked J\u00fanior Moraes\u2019s finish towards an empty net.\n\nFor the second half Castro took off Manor Solomon for Yevhen Konoplyanka, the Israeli having failed to make an impact, and Donetsk soon had a golden chance to pull one back.\n\nEderson misjudged a charge out to the ball allowing J\u00fanior Moraes to aim a lob towards an empty net, but the effort went wide. Almost instantly G\u00fcndogan went close at the other end, but the midfielder was unable to finish.\n\nThe same player overran the ball when put clean through from a Sterling pass, the mistake causing Guardiola to throw his hands in the air \u2013 the manager was conscious one more goal would finish it.\n\nConsidering the defeat at Norwich and loss of Laporte and Stones, this was moving towards the kind of assured evening Guardiola wanted. Confirmation came when Jesus scored, and there was even a late cameo for Benjamin Mendy, making his first appearance since April.\n\nOn Saturday Watford are the visitors when Guardiola\u2019s new central defence will be tested for the first time in the Premier League. He may be relieved that injury to Troy Deeney, a centre-forward who rarely gives defenders an easy time, means Fernandinho will at least not have to deal with him.", "description": "Ilkay G\u00fcndogan scored the pick of the goals as Manchester City eased to a 3-0 away victory over Shakhtar Donetsk", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d48ea831a3cc20684fcd33a571d4c614f0c2c49/0_92_5040_3023/master/5040.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7dab88c982a2379daa83cae1b47f34d9", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
