Joseph did not appear to be with them at the time.\n\nSukkot is a week-long holiday that falls five days after Yom Kippur. It celebrates the gathering of the harvest and the protection that the Israelites received when they left Egypt.\n\nThe holiday started at sundown on October 13, and during the first two days, work is forbidden, candles are lit in the evening, and meals are followed by Kiddush, a ceremony of prayer and blessing over wine.\n\nIvanka and her family were seen walking to the Friends of Lubavitch Synagogue together on Monday morning as well.\n\nThe day also happened to be Joseph's sixth birthday, and all three children were dressed up for the special occasion.\n\nRebel: Theodore donned helmet with skulls on it as he zipped ahead of his parents on the sidewalk\n\nDressed up: Theodore donned a slate gray cardigan sweater over his button-down shirt\n\nHaving fun; Joseph flashed a bright smile as he skidded to a stop on his blue scooter, which matched his little brother's\n\nSafety first: Like Theodore, Joseph also wore a helmet while riding his scooter on Tuesday morning\n\nThe birthday boy donned a white button-down and navy blue trousers, which were paired with a brown belt and a pair of navy loafers. Meanwhile, his younger brother Theodore looked just as dapper in a navy blue suit and a white button-down.\n\nArabella went all out too, opting for a silver dress, a matching headband, and a pair of pretty pink ballet flats. She was also seen wearing a silver and purple backpack.\n\nAnd while her younger brothers appeared to be content ignoring the cameras, Arabella couldn't resist the chance to ham it up for the photographers.\n\nShe made a series of grumpy faces in their direction before playing a game of hide and seek, secreting herself away behind her father as they strolled along.\n\nAt one point, Jared and Ivanka were seen exchanging knowing smiles as their daughter ran behind him and pushed him ahead of her.\n\nTuckered out: The family was also seen walking home after attending the holiday celebration and their synagogue\n\nHelping hand: Arabella got a piggyback ride from her father, while Theodore continued to ride his scooter\n\nDoting mom: Ivanka rested her hand on her little girl's back as they made their way home together\n\nNot in the mood: While Jared smiled at the photographers taking their photo, Arabella gave a pout\n\nFeeling tired: The couple's only daughter looked absolutely exhausted as she held onto her dad\n\nSolo: Ivanka walked by herself for a bit while Theodore rode his scooter and Arabella was carried by her father\n\nThe young boys didn't seem to mind their sister's joking around, with the two brothers taking turns to walk with both their mother and their father while making their way to the synagogue.\n\nAt one point, Ivanka was seen strolling with birthday boy Joseph. She leaned over to say something to him as they walked hand in hand along the sidewalk \u2014 all while under the watchful eye of several Secret Service agents.\n\nMuch like her children, she put on a show for the holiday, pairing a long-sleeved black shift dress with black ankle boots.\n\nShe topped off her outfit with a matching black hat to cover her head and covered up her legs with a pair of thick black tights.\n\nThe first daughter injected some more pizzazz into her look with a chic patterned neck scarf that was tied in a knot just above the neckline of her dress. To protect her eyes from the sunshine, she wore a pair of large black shades.\n\nOff they go! Ivanka and Jared were also seen walking to their local synagogue with their kids on Monday morning. Sukkot began at sundown on Sunday, October 13\n\nAll smiles: Ivanka looked demure in an all-black outfit, wearing a shift dress and a pair of thick black tights\n\nExpressive: Arabella made faces and wagged her finger at the camera while walking alongside her dad\n\nMama's boy: Ivanka held onto Joseph's hand as they walked together during the family outing, which has become an annual tradition for them\n\nJared also wore a pair of sunglasses, but unlike his sons, he left his signature navy suit at home for the day and opted to wear something slightly more casual than his day-to-day work attire.\n\nHe sported navy trousers, a gray long-sleeved shirt, and a cozy padded green vest. Instead of wearing loafers like his sons, he had on dark gray sneakers.\n\nIvanka converted to Judaism in 2009 to marry Jared, an Orthodox Jew, and they are raising their three children Orthodox as well.\n\nThe family's stroll to the synagogue has become something of an annual tradition since they moved from New York to D.C. at the start of 2017, Ivanka and Jared took on official roles in the Trump administration.\n\nIn October of that year, the family was seen making their way to the synagogue with all three of the children riding scooters, while Ivanka and Jared strolled alongside them.\n\nThen, in October 2018, Ivanka was pictured taking Arabella, Joseph, and Theodore to the synagogue for Shemini Atzeret, which immediately follows the seventh day of Sukkot, a separate, yet connected, holy day.", "description": "Ivanka, 37, and Jared, 38, were seen walking to\u00a0Friends of Lubavitch Synagogue in Washington, D.C. with their three children, Arabella, Joseph, and Theodore, on Tuesday morning.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/20/19756220-0-image-a-187_1571167487881.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
