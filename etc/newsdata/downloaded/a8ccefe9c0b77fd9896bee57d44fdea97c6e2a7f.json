Elizabeth Warren is stepping up her outreach in South Carolina. Before now, she\u2019s held fewer events in the state than Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nROCK HILL, S.C. \u2015 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren came to historically Black Clinton College in this suburb of Charlotte hoping to woo the voters she needs to complete a coalition that can claim the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination: African Americans.\n\nWarren\u2019s slow and steady rise in polling has been largely powered by white voters with college degrees, though more recent polls have shown gains across basically every demographic within the Democratic Party. But one of her biggest rivals for the nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden, still has a substantial lead among African American voters nationally and in this crucial state, the first in the south to cast its primary ballots.\n\nCompared to Iowa and New Hampshire \u2015 the overwhelmingly white states that vote first and second in the primary \u2015 Warren has spent little time in South Carolina. A local reporter noted it had been more than a month since her last public event in the state, and a candidate tracker from the Charleston Post and Courier shows her attending just 12 events in the state before Saturday, compared to 17 for Biden, and more than 30 for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the third leading contender for the nomination. (Two African American candidates \u2015 California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker \u2015 lead the way with 36 and 39 events, respectively.)\n\nWarren\u2019s supporters in South Carolina say if she picks up her pace in visits to the state, African American voters will embrace her message of battling political corruption and raising taxes on the wealthy to fund universal child care and free public higher education.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still a high-touch community, even in a high-tech society,\u201d said state Sen. Wendy Brawley, an African American who predicted Warren could win the state. \u201cShe gets that she needs to show up where we are.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s stop at Clinton College showed the promises and challenges that face the former Harvard Law professor. The crowd of roughly 1,000 people was mostly white, and attendees of all races largely said they arrived at the event already in her corner. Warren\u2019s pitch barely varied from her standard stump speech: She walked voters through her famous policy plans while nearly totally avoiding two hot topics of the day \u2015 the possible impeachment of President Donald Trump and the details of her support for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d She did note her higher education plan would funnel an additional $50 billion to historically Black colleges like Clinton.\n\nIt\u2019s not new for Warren to be courting African Americans. Some Black progressive activists have been raving about her since at least April, and she\u2019s often held listening sessions with Black leaders as she tours the country.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I\u2019m in this fight, what\u2019s broken and how to fix it,\u201d Warren told reporters when asked about the majority-white crowd and what she needed to do to win over Black voters.\n\nBut it does appears Warren is ready to invest more time and resources in the state. She\u2019s opening a campaign office in Rock Hill next week, her campaign said. But while the Warren team is eager to talk up the strength of their field operations in Iowa and New Hampshire, they declined to reveal how many staffers are on the ground in the Palmetto State. (In total, Warren has 300 staffers, and 60% of those are in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.) Biden\u2019s campaign has 41 staffers on the ground here.\n\nBrawley and other Warren backers in the state pointed to two Warren policies they believe could help court Black voters: Her education policies \u2014 including the elimination of student debt \u2014 could woo younger Black voters, while her proposal to make sure no family spends more than 7% of its income on childcare would attract Black women of all ages.\n\n\u201cIn my district, when you have grandparents raising their grands, when you have people working two jobs to keep a roof over their heads, not having childcare is a real issue,\u201d Brawley said. \u201cThese are pocketbook issues that really matter, that can change people\u2019s lives if we give them even a little attention.\u201d\n\nCasey McClure, a 26-year-old who said she \u201cloved everything about\u201d Warren, suggested Biden\u2019s lead in the state was due to a generation gap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the older voters,\u201d she said, noting she had met Biden during one of his earlier stops in the state. \u201cShe needs to get the young people out to vote.\u201d\n\nBut there are some signs the gap might be closing. \u201cI love Joe, but he might not be as spunky as he used to,\u201d said McClure\u2019s mother, who declined to give her name.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll this week saw Warren essentially tied with Biden, and building beyond her base of college-educated white voters. She earned the support of 27% of Democrats and Democratic-learning voters nationally, compared to 25% for the former vice president, and 16% for Sanders. That included a lead among college-educated white voters, liberals, voters aged 35 to 50, and those making more than $50,000 a year. She also tied Biden among white voters without a college degree.\n\nAmong white voters overall, Warren led Biden 33% to 23%. But among Black voters, Biden\u2019s advantage was substantial: Forty percent said they support him, while only 19% backed Warren.\n\nThat still represents a marked improvement for Warren. In July, the same poll found just 4% of Black voters supported her, while 53% supported Biden.\n\nA CNN poll of South Carolina voters released Sunday morning, however, painted a much grimmer picture for Warren. The poll showed Biden earning 37% of the statewide vote to Warren\u2019s 16%, with Sanders at 11%. Among Black voters, Warren tallied just 4% of the vote compared to Biden\u2019s 45% and Sanders\u2019 13%.\n\nBiden and his allies have long viewed Black voters as a crucial backstop for his campaign. While Sanders turned in strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire in 2016, his campaign floundered as Hillary Clinton, the party\u2019s eventual nominee, routed him among African Americans.\n\nThe primary schedule is similar this year. Fourteen states are holding their primaries on March 3, so-called Super Tuesday, when more than 40% of the Democratic delegates are up for grabs. Six of those states, including delegate-rich Texas, are at least 10% Black.\n\nBut state Rep. Kambrell Garvin, another Warren backer, suggested Biden and others shouldn\u2019t count on South Carolina\u2019s voters to stay static, and noted the results in Iowa and New Hampshire could sway their votes.\n\n\u201cI know South Carolina for some of the other campaigns is considered to be a firewall state, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think African-American voters are not monolithic, and I think they\u2019re going to make decisions that best suit their community.\u201d", "description": "Biden is leading in South Carolina, but Warren supporters hope a focus on the state \u2014 plus her education and child care plans \u2014 can win over African Amer...", "authors": ["Senior Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d901fd32100003100fd3e36.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
