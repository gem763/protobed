The new system is meant to let civilians like you and I display our required identification details on the screens of our smartphones instead of having to faff about with bits of holographic plastic.\n\nHowever, said system also requires you to download an app and sign up, and it turns out that the whole technology schemozzle still presents something of a speedbump for the NSW government.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, the whole thing crashed almost as soon as it rolled out, because of course it did. Let us never forget the barbaric requests from government websites that we use Internet Explorer as the default browser when trying to lodge our tax or (heaven forbid) access Centrelink.\n\nMany punters who downloaded the app, eager to fling yet another useless trinket out of their wallet to make space for more Boost Juice loyalty cards, were stymied by messages like \u201csomething went wrong\u201d, \u201cplease try again later\u201d, and \u201cWe\u2019re a little busy.\u201d You think?\n\nDigital Driver Licenses are live in NSW. Sorta. pic.twitter.com/ifHJmr7KbK \u2014 Luke Hopewell (@lukehopewell) October 28, 2019\n\nLabor\u2019s shadow minister for Better Public Services, Sophie Cotsis, had some choice words for the app\u2019s functionality \u2013 particularly as it\u2019s been in the making for over five years.\n\nREAD MORE Former \u2018Idol\u2019 Star Paulini Avoids Jail Time For Bribing Government Official\n\nHow can it be the case that this is so late and still so clearly not ready? Liberal Minister Victor Dominello was right when he said he was worried about stability. The app keeps crashing. I\u2019m not convinced that this is a reliable platform yet. I won\u2019t be getting a digital driver\u2019s licence until we\u2019re all sure the system is stable. You can\u2019t blame anyone that waits.\n\nCan you blame me for getting one just so I can yell at the app for crashing? It\u2019s low-key one of my favourite things to do. Come on, robots! Do better!", "description": "The digital driver's licence app went public today after being trialled (and delayed) for years.
