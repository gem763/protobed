Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, who play news anchors in Apple TV+\u2019s upcoming series The Morning Show, played anchor on Good Morning America today. (Witherspoon\u2019s brunette wig missed this appearance.) They gave the morning\u2019s headlines (Prince\u2019s new autobiography, and the right-hand woman to the queen speaks out) before getting too excited about their little lark and inviting out the real anchors, Robin Roberts and George Stephanopoulos. Compliments fly! \u201cWe can retire now, right?\u201d Stephanopoulos jokes. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the rest of the morning off, you take it away!\u201d The Morning Show co-stars, including Billy Crudup but not including Steve Carell, joined them in the audience. The Morning Show, along with a world of other content, hits Apple TV+ on November 1.\n\nCorrection: This post originally referred to Robin Roberts as Robin Wright.", "description": "Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and the cast of \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 on Apple TV+ take over \u2018Good Morning America.\u2019", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/28/28-jennifer-aniston-reese-witherspoon.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
