That included seven-figure drops in income at some iconic Trump resorts. His Mar-a-Lago club brought in about $2.5 million less than it did in 2017. Income from the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles dropped by roughly $3 million. And the Trump Organization\u2019s hotel management arm saw its income plummet by nearly $16 million, though its numbers for 2018 were more in line with those prior to Trump assuming the presidency.\n\nOther Trump properties fared better. His Doral resort in Miami hiked its income by about $2.2 million in spite of internal concerns about declining residency reported by The Washington Post this week. Trump Turnberry, a golf resort in Scotland, saw income increase by $3 million. Trump\u2019s hotel at Washington\u2019s Old Post Office, just blocks from the White House, maintained an income of just over $40 million, second only to Doral in total income among the properties examined. And the company that manages Trump\u2019s golf club in Dubai more than doubled its income, though it was still a small portion of the resort portfolio.\n\nOverall, though, the president\u2019s hospitality business appears to have taken a hit last year. And it suggests that the divisiveness of his presidency is impacting his business empire.\n\nAll of Trump\u2019s assets reside in a trust set up when he took office and managed by his two adult sons. The president claims that that setup insulates him from conflict of interest questions, but the structure of the trust allows him to draw profits from his business whenever he sees fit.\n\nThe arrangement has drawn intense criticism from good government groups, and Trump\u2019s continued profiting from hotels and resorts patronized by foreign governments has led to multiple lawsuits alleging he has violated an anti-bribery provision of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTrump\u2019s business portfolio is more expansive than the resorts, hotels and golf clubs that he owns. He also lists a variety of limited liability corporations from which he derives rent, interest, royalties, and condo sales. But income from those were often listed in broad ranges and rarely varied from prior years.\n\nWhile the vast majority of the president\u2019s income continues to come through real estate ventures of some form, he also maintains some less expected income streams. In 2018, for example, he brought in nearly $100,000 from a pair of pensions paid out by a pair of unions: the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not return a request for comment.", "description": "In all, business at his flagship properties was down about nine percent from last year\u2019s totals.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay", "Sam Stein", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1558036462/190516-lachstein-trump-tease_t8ijrv", "published_at": "2019-05-16"}
