When asked what they\u2019ve done with their cash, the boys told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We\u2019re just planning stuff that we want to do.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had so many big ideas over the years, like a big show and stuff like that. We want to invest it back into ourselves and the big ideas we have.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe boys busted a move to some high-energy dance tracks (and the Love Island theme) (Picture: ITV)\n\nThe dancers revealed that they also recognise this opportunity as a massive launch pad for them back into the public consciousness.\n\n\u2018We think [the win] is going to kickstart [us] to a whole new audience this time,\u2019 they shared. \u2018As well as people that have followed us through the years. It\u2019s an opportunity to show everything we\u2019ve got.\u2019\n\nThe boys first competed on Britain\u2019s Got Talent in 2010, where they placed as runners-up to gymnastic troupe Spellbound. In the nine years that have passed, they know there\u2019s now an entirely new generation of fans just waiting for their next Twist and Pulse fix.\n\nSimon Cowell doubled the initial prize for the contest to \u00a3100k (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018All the fans that were there in like 2010 have kind of grown up to be our age now,\u2019 the two friends said. \u2018So we have a brand new generation that may have not known about Twist and Pulse so it\u2019s incredible for them to kind of go back and research and see what we\u2019ve done.\u2019\n\nSaturday night saw the dancers triumph over the father-son duo Stavros Flatley and winning \u00a3100,000 and the honour of being named the first winners of the series, which brought together some of the most well-known and successful acts from the Got Talent franchise from both home and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first series of Britain\u2019s Got Talent: The Champions was an eventful one; from surprise early-on eliminations to a Susan Boyle no show.\n\nAfter the finale last night, though, that\u2019s still got everyone to thinking we could be seeing a second run soon..\n\nBritain\u2019s Got Talent: The Champions is available to catch up on ITV Hub.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
