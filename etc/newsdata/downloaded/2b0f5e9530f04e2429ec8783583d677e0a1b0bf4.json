Trump imposed the tariffs in August after a failed round of talks, effectively setting up punitive duties on nearly all of the $US550 billion in US imports from China.\n\n\"The Chinese want to get back to tariffs on just the original $US250 billion in goods,\" the source said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerek Scissors, a resident scholar and China expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said the original goal of the early October talks was to finalise a text on intellectual property, agriculture and market access to pave the way for a postponement of the December 15 tariffs.\n\n\"It's odd that (the president) was so upbeat with (Chinese Vice-Premier) Liu He and yet we still don't have the December 15 tariffs taken off the table,\" Scissors said.\n\nThe \"Phase 1\" deal is expected to do little to deal with core US complaints about Chinese theft and forced transfer of American intellectual property and technology. Tribune\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week said no decisions were made about the December 15 tariffs, but added: \"We'll address that as we continue to have conversations.\"\n\nIf a text can be sealed, Beijing in return would exempt some US agricultural products from tariffs, including soybeans, wheat and corn, a China-based source told Reuters. Buyers would be exempt from extra tariffs for future buying and get returns for tariffs they already paid in previous purchases of the products on the list.\n\nBut the ultimate amounts of China's purchases are uncertain.\n\nTrump has touted purchases of $US40 billion to $US50 billion annually - far above China's 2017 purchases of $US19.5 billion as measured by the American Farm Bureau.\n\nOne of the sources briefed on the talks said China's offer would start at around $US20 billion in annual purchases, largely restoring the pre-trade-war status quo, but this could rise over time. Purchases also would depend on market conditions and pricing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has emphasised China's agreement to remove some restrictions on US genetically modified crops and other food safety barriers, which the sources said is significant because it could pave the way for much higher US farm exports to China.\n\nThe high-level call came a day after US Vice President Mike Pence railed against China's trade practices and what he termed construction of a \"surveillance state\" in a major policy speech. But Pence left the door open to a trade deal with China, saying Trump wanted a \"constructive\" relationship with Beijing.\n\nWhile the US tariffs on Chinese goods has brought China to the negotiating table to address US grievances over its trade practices and intellectual property practices, they have so far failed to lead to significant change in China's state-led economic model.\n\nThe \"Phase 1\" deal will ease tensions and provide some market stability, but is expected to do little to deal with core US complaints about Chinese theft and forced transfer of American intellectual property and technology. The intellectual property rights chapter in the agreement largely deals with copyright and trademark issues and pledges to curb technology transfers that Beijing has already put into a new investment law, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nMore difficult issues, including data restrictions, China's cybersecurity regulations and industrial subsidies will be left for later phases of talks. But some China trade experts said that a completion of a Phase 1 deal could leave little incentive for China to negotiate further, especially with a US election in 2020.\n\n\"US-China talks change very quickly from hot to cold but, the longer it takes to nail down the easy phase 1, the harder it is to imagine a phase 2 breakthrough,\" said Scissors.\n\nReuters", "description": "US President Donald Trump has said he hopes to sign the deal with China's President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4505%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_212/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/60739fe562ede096de2bdee84080b48f1180d296", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
