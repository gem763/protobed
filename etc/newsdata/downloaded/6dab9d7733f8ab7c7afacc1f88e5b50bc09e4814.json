And, like splashing pedestrians, it can be thousands of pounds.\u201d", "description": "The video, recorded in Stafford, shows a silver Audi going over a speed bump before accelerating to the opposite side of the road where there is large amount of surface water", "authors": ["Hayley Parker", "Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Dinendra Haria Lnp", "Staffordshire Tactical Information Group", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20639709.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Shocking-moment-driver-ploughs-into-puddle-to-soak-pedestrian-and-now-they-face-\u00a35000-fineThe-sh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
