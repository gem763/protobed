Some examples include the polar lights, coronal mass ejections, and geomagnetic storms. A number of space weather events occur when charged particles from the sun enter the upper most region\u2019s of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nRadiation from the sun ionizes the particles in ionosphere creating a layer of electrons that can vary substantially during solar cycles\u2014the 11 year-period it takes for the Sun's north and south poles switch positions.\n\nICON had originally been planned for a 2017 launch but a series of mechanical failures led to a number of delays.\n\nThe launch will be carried out from another aircraft already inflight, a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar craft named Stargazer.\n\nLast year, the ESA's Met Office issued a warning that one particularly devastating form of space weather, a solar storm, is inevitable and could devastate Earth's power grids and communication networks.\n\nIn 1859, a large solar storm, called The Carrington Event, caused streams of fire to come out of telegraph equipment and turned the sky blood red.", "description": "After years of delay, NASA's ICON research satellite has launched, part of the agency's plans to collect data about the still mysterious relationship between space weather and terrestrial weather.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19556862-0-image-a-38_1570739410138.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
