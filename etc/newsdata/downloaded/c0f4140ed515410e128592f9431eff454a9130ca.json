It has been done six times in the five-year College Football Playoff Era, and only by teams from the SEC, ACC or Independent. (Yes, the critics are free to point out that those teams play eight \u2014 or zero \u2014 conference games, while the Pac-12, Big Ten and Big 12 play nine.)\n\nClemson and Alabama each have gone undefeated into the playoff twice (2016 and \u201918 for the Crimson Tide, 2015 and \u201918 for the Tigers). Notre Dame (2018) and Florida State (2014) have done it once. The last regular-season Pac-12 unbeaten was Oregon in 2010; the last Big 12 unbeaten was Texas 2009; the last Big Ten unbeaten was Ohio State 2012 (and the Buckeyes were serving a postseason ban for NCAA violations).\n\nSo, yeah, it\u2019s difficult. But the rewards are great.\n\nEvery Power Five team that runs the table has been assured of a playoff berth. History has shown that the selection committee likes that zero in the loss column more than any other measurable. So it\u2019s time to take a look at the top nine playoff contenders and calculate the difficulty of going 13-0.\n\nThe list, from easiest to hardest, using Sagarin Ratings as a metric to estimate point spreads, is below. The Dash is setting the over-under for undefeated Power Five teams at 1.5 for this season:\n\nClemson (1). The path: Florida State, at Louisville, Boston College, Wofford, at North Carolina State, Wake Forest, at South Carolina, ACC championship game (presumptive opponent Virginia). Current ranked opponents remaining: Two. Wake Forest (No. 19) and theoretically Virginia (No. 20).\n\nStory continues\n\nNumber of times Clemson will be an underdog, as of today: zero. Number of times Clemson will be a single-digit favorite: zero. Number of times Clemson will be at least a two-touchdown favorite: all of them. Closest spread: Favored by 16 against Virginia on neutral field in Charlotte. (It wouldn\u2019t actually be a neutral field.)\n\nEveryone would trade paths with the defending national champions right now. The ACC is a mundane collection of riffraff, rival South Carolina is no good, and the ACC title game is 135 miles from Clemson\u2019s campus. The only downside: The Tigers would seem unlikely to be able to absorb a loss and still make the playoff field.\n\nOhio State (2). The path: at Northwestern, Wisconsin, Maryland, at Rutgers, Penn State, at Michigan, Big Ten championship game (presumptive opponent Wisconsin). Currently ranked opponents remaining: four. Wisconsin theoretically twice (No. 8), Penn State (No. 10), Michigan (No. 16).\n\nNumber of times Ohio State will be an underdog, as of today: zero. Number of times Ohio State will be a single-digit favorite: one (Wisconsin on a neutral field). Number of times Ohio State will be at least a two-touchdown favorite: four. Closest spread: Favored by eight in Indianapolis against the Badgers.\n\nThe Buckeyes would figure to be a 10\u00bd-point favorite over Wisconsin and 12\u00bd over Penn State in the Horseshoe. Michigan in the Big House? A fat 15\u00bd going strictly by the Sagarin numbers. It\u2019s not all going to be that easy, no matter how good Ohio State has looked thus far. The Penn State game is a traditional white-knuckler, and beating Wisconsin twice would be a challenge.\n\nJ.K.

The path: Texas in Dallas, West Virginia, at Kansas State, Iowa State, at Baylor, TCU, at Oklahoma State, Big 12 championship game (presumptive opponent Texas). Current ranked opponents remaining: three. Texas theoretically twice (No. 11), Baylor (No. 22).\n\nNumber of times Oklahoma will be an underdog, as of today: zero. Number of times Oklahoma will be a single-digit favorite: three (Texas twice, at Baylor). Number of times Oklahoma will be at least a two-touchdown favorite: four. Closest spread: Favored by seven at Baylor.\n\nThe Sooners\u2019 defense has been improved enough that they haven\u2019t had to outscore an opponent yet. But the opposition has not been good. The Red River game Saturday will, as usual, tell us a lot. The lack of a quality non-conference win means a one-loss Oklahoma could be in jeopardy of losing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 contest, if it came down to that.\n\nAlabama (4). The path: at Texas A&M, Tennessee, Arkansas, LSU, at Mississippi State, Western Carolina, at Auburn, SEC championship game (presumptive opponent Georgia). Current ranked opponents remaining: four. Texas A&M (No. 24), LSU (No. 5), Auburn (No. 12), Georgia theoretically in SEC title game (No. 3).\n\nNumber of times Alabama will be an underdog, as of today: zero. Number of times Alabama will be a single-digit favorite: three (LSU, Auburn, Georgia in theory). Number of times Alabama will be at least a two-touchdown favorite: four. Closest spread: Favored by 6\u00bd at Auburn.\n\nHistory says to pencil the Crimson Tide into the playoff, but they haven\u2019t had a road this difficult before. Auburn is good, the SEC East champion would be a title-game test \u2014 but the biggest change is what looks like the best LSU team since 2011. Still, Alabama has three times advanced to the playoff with one loss, and once without winning its conference or division.\n\nLSU (5). The path: Florida, at Mississippi State, Auburn, at Alabama, at Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas A&M, SEC championship game (presumptive opponent Georgia). Current ranked opponents remaining: five. Florida (No. 7), Auburn (No. 12), Alabama (No. 1), Texas A&M (No. 24), Georgia theoretically in SEC title game (No. 3).\n\nNumber of times LSU will be an underdog, as of today: one (7\u00bd points at Alabama). Number of times LSU will be a single-digit favorite: three (Florida, Auburn, Georgia in theory). Number of times LSU will be at least a two-touchdown favorite: four. Closest spread: Favored by 3\u00bd vs. Georgia in SEC title game.\n\nThe Tigers have an absolute meat grinder ahead of them, which makes running the table unlikely \u2014 especially when their mission to end the eight-game losing streak to Alabama takes them into Bryant-Denny Stadium, where the Tide hasn\u2019t lost since September 2015. But as of now they would be favored in every other game, and they could put together a very compelling one-loss r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nGeorgia (6). The path: South Carolina, Kentucky, Florida in Jacksonville, Missouri, at Auburn, Texas A&M, at Georgia Tech, SEC championship game (presumptive opponent Alabama). Current ranked opponents remaining: four. Florida (No. 7), Auburn (No. 12), Texas A&M (No. 24), Alabama theoretically in SEC title game (No. 1).\n\nNumber of times Georgia will be an underdog, as of today: two (Auburn, Alabama in theory), with a possible pick-em line against Florida. Number of times Georgia will be a single-digit favorite: one (Missouri). Number of times Georgia will be at least a two-touchdown favorite: three. Closest spread: pick-em vs. Florida.\n\nThe competition is formidable, but the locations are favorable. Four home games, a 50-50 crowd split in Jacksonville against the Gators, a short jaunt across the Chattahoochee River to Auburn, a drive to Atlanta to play Tech in front of a lot of red shirts, and a potential SEC title game in Atlanta as well. If Georgia gets to the SEC championship game undefeated, it could perhaps absorb a loss there (to nemesis Alabama?) and still make the playoff.\n\nFlorida (7). The path: at LSU, at South Carolina, Georgia in Jacksonville, Vanderbilt, at Missouri, Florida State, SEC championship game (presumptive opponent Alabama). Current ranked opponents remaining: LSU (No. 5), Georgia (No. 3), Alabama theoretically in SEC title game (No. 1).\n\nNumber of times Florida will be an underdog, as of today: two (LSU, Alabama in theory), plus a pick-em game against Georgia. Number of times Florida will be a single-digit favorite: one (Missouri). Number of times Florida will be at least a two-touchdown favorite: two. Closest spread: pick-em vs. Georgia.\n\nThe Gators almost assuredly aren\u2019t going 13-0 with games remaining against three top-five teams, none of them in The Swamp. But on the flip side, winning two out of three would seemingly keep them in the thick of the playoff hunt, depending on what is happening elsewhere. Florida also has to figure out a way to beat Missouri, which has routed the Gators twice in a row and won four of the past six.\n\nWisconsin (8). The path: Michigan State, at Illinois, at Ohio State, Iowa, at Nebraska, Purdue, at Minnesota, Big Ten championship game (presumptive opponent Ohio State). Current ranked opponents remaining: three. Ohio State (No. 3) twice, Iowa (No. 17).\n\nNumber of times Wisconsin will be an underdog, as of today: two (Ohio State twice). Number of times Wisconsin will be a single-digit favorite: none. Number of times Wisconsin will be at least a two-touchdown favorite: five. Closest spread: eight-point underdog against the Buckeyes in Indianapolis.\n\nThe Badgers look much better than the rest of the Big Ten West, especially since Iowa is coming to Madison. But they have some ground to cover to match up with Ohio State, especially with the first meeting in Columbus. But a split of two potential meetings with the Buckeyes and six other victories would make Wisconsin a pretty compelling 12-1 team.\n\nPenn State (9). The path: at Iowa, Michigan, at Michigan State, at Minnesota, Indiana, at Ohio State, Rutgers, Big Ten championship game (presumptive opponent Wisconsin). Current ranked opponents remaining: four. Iowa (No. 17), Michigan (No. 16), Ohio State (No. 3), Wisconsin theoretically in Big Ten title game (No. 8).\n\nNumber of times Penn State will be an underdog, as of today: two (Ohio State, Wisconsin). Number of times Penn State will be a single-digit favorite: two (Iowa, Michigan State). Number of times Penn State will be at least a two-touchdown favorite: three. Closest spread: two-point underdog to Wisconsin in Indianapolis.\n\nWith four road games remaining against teams with a combined record of 19-3, the going is tough. The Nittany Lions have played very well thus far, but the competition is about to escalate. How well does a young team \u2014 particularly a young offense \u2014 handle the challenge?\n\nAnd the leading contender to go undefeated from the Group of Five conferences and be snubbed by the playoff? Boise State (10). The Broncos are 5-0 and, as of today, likely to be favored by 10 or more points against everyone but Utah State (in Logan on Nov. 23).\n\nBoise\u2019s problem is that the lone non-conference victory of note was against a Florida State team that is Florida State in name only. The Seminoles could do the Broncos a huge favor \u2014 while dealing a death blow to their own conference \u2014 by upsetting Clemson on the road Saturday. Good luck on that.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Every Power Five team that has run the table so far has been given a playoff berth.
