WeWork\n\nWeWork publicly filed its IPO paperwork on August 14. \"The We Company\" was described as an umbrella with three major arms: WeWork, WeLive, and WeGrow.\n\nAfter the filing, WeWork faced intense scrutiny of its finances and leadership from investors and the media. There were concerns about WeWork's path to profitability and its leader, CEO and cofounder Adam Neumann. As a result, investor interest was weak, and the company considered cutting its valuation by more than 50%. Ultimately, WeWork delayed its IPO on September 17.\n\nAfter the delay, attention shifted to Neumann's inappropriate antics, like reports of his smoking weed on a private jet, serving employees tequila shots after discussing layoffs, and trademarking the term \"We\" and then forcing WeWork to buy it for $5.9 million. Neumann stepped down from his role as CEO on September 24. Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham have stepped into the role of co-CEOs of WeWork as it attempts to navigate its future.", "description": "Attempting to go public stirred up a lot of drama \u2014 in finances and leadership \u2014 for WeWork, the nine-year-old coworking company.", "authors": ["Rebecca Aydin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7b77a62e22af050d4470a5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
