He now joins his father - the former winger Emile Ntamack - in playing at the World Cup.\n\nNtamack is likely to share kicking duties with Lopez, with both having taken penalties for France before.\n\nVeteran Maxime Medard is vying for the starting position at full-back with Thomas Ramos, while Fiji-born Clermont winger Alivereti Raka contests a starting berth with the pacey Yoann Huget and Damian Penaud.", "description": "It is against USA on Wednesday, October 2, at 8.45am BST.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6y3JfGduL4r0tk3SK_GAUg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KXbs7LdJS40MZLlNag3lTw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/f8cfc606f97b2f7fdc68729689f76480"}
