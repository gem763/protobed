Trump, picking up on remarks made by an evangelical pastor on Fox News, did not just say his removal would lead to a huge electoral defeat for the Democrats, or even mass demonstrations. He said, \u201ccivil war.\u201d Americans taking up arms against other Americans in his name.\n\n\u201cCivil War 2\u201d started trending on Twitter. So, for a time, did #CivilWarSignup.\n\nIn the modern era, real civil wars have been the great affliction of Third World countries\u2014conflicts that split nations and societies along political, ethnic or religious fault lines. They are very often accompanied by martial law and resolved by military intervention. Is this what Trump has in mind? Where would the U.S. military stand in such a situation? A view from the inside indicates the armed forces are as divided as the rest of the country\u2014and divided is a dangerous place for the U.S. military to find itself.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u2018Civil War\u2019 Tweet Didn\u2019t Come From Nowhere\u2014in Fact, It Came From Here\n\nAfter spending 19 years in Washington with intelligence jobs in Congress, at the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (focusing on counterterrorism and counterintelligence), I had the opportunity to join the Commander\u2019s Red Team at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida.\n\nWithin a few years, however, CENTCOM\u2019s senior leadership told us Red Team\u2019s \u201calternative analysis\u201d was \u201cconfusing\u201d the commander. (Truth was, they really didn\u2019t want any competing analysis contradicting what the traditional intelligence analysts were selling.) I was told I would now be an Intelligence Planner. Intelligence Planners provide critical intelligence support to military operations. (CENTCOM has responsibility for most of the Middle East, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the fight against ISIS.) I remained at CENTCOM for 12 years.\n\nOur republic rests on the important constitutional principle of civilian control of a non-politicized military. But the constant drumbeat of right-wing conspiracy theories and hateful political rhetoric has found its way into a sizable portion of the U.S. military\u2019s rank and file. Not too long ago, the majority of those serving in the military would have identified themselves as Reagan Republicans. But just as that brand of Republicanism has been replaced by Trumpism among civilian Republicans, so too has it seeped into the armed forces, and by these standards, even Ronald Reagan would be viewed as a socialist.\n\nRecent polling shows that among military veterans, approval ratings for Trump are higher than among the civilian population. In my experience, the support for Donald Trump among a large segment of the U.S. military is downright cult-like.\n\nNone of this makes sense. Donald Trump is everything the U.S. military should despise: a draft dodger, adulterer, flabby, lazy, unread, a tabloid joke for decades, and TV reality show star. During the 2016 campaign, Trump sought to brandish his non-existent national security chops by insulting Obama\u2019s generals. \u201cI know more about ISIS than the generals do. The generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point where it\u2019s embarrassing for our country.\u201d He hinted that as president, he would fire them. \u201cThey\u2019d probably be different generals,\u201d he said at NBC\u2019s pre-election Commander-in-Chief Forum.\n\nThe man with a decades-long public record of immoral and unethical behavior, who had never served in uniform or undertook any public service to his country, tweeted juvenile insults about retired 4-star generals like Colin Powell, John Allen, Stanley McCrystal, Michael Hayden and Martin Dempsey. Several of these decorated, battle-hardened generals, were life-long Republicans who had devoted their lives to serving their country. Yet they believed so strongly that Trump was a national security danger they took the extraordinary step of breaking with military tradition to criticize him publicly.\n\nIn normal times, this would have dealt a severe blow to any campaign and made a serious dent in support among the military. But the attacks by the generals, and Trump\u2019s willingness to return fire, only endeared him to the rank and file more.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily BeastEarlier this week Donald Trump, the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces, tweeted that his impeachment \u201cwill cause a Civil War\u201d from which the country might never recover.
