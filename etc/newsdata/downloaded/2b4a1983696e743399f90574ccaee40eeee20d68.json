We're talking the 2030s for operational service, and the work is already very advanced.\"\n\nThe precooler passed its tests with flying colors Reaction Engines\n\nFans of supersonic flight have been yearning for a new way to break the sound barrier ever since Concorde stopped flying in 2003.\n\nIn April 2019, Reaction Engines announced successful tests of a precooler, simulating conditions at Mach 3.3, or more than three times the speed of sound.\n\nThat's more than 50% faster than the cruising speed of Concorde -- which used to make the journey between New York and Paris in around 3.5 hours -- and matches the speed record of the fastest jet aircraft ever made, the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.\n\nThe precooler tests took place at a testing facility at the Colorado Air and Space Port in the United States.\n\nAt such high speeds, air flowing through the engine can reach incredibly high temperatures, which can potentially cause damage.\n\nReaction Engines says SABRE combines the fuel efficiency of a jet engine with the power and high-speed ability of a rocket. Reaction Engines\n\nA precooler reduces the temperature of gases before they enter the core engine itself.\n\nRecent tests prove that the component can cool gases from over 1,000 C to ambient temperature in less than 1/20th of a second, according to a statement from Reaction Engines.\n\n\"This is a hugely significant milestone which has seen Reaction Engines' proprietary precooler technology achieve unparalleled heat transfer performance,\" said Mark Thomas, Reaction Engines' CEO.\n\n\"The HTX [precooler] test article met all test objectives and the successful initial tests highlight how our precooler delivers world-leading heat transfer capabilities at low weight and compact size.\"\n\nThomas emphasized that the technology could also be used in hybrid electric aviation as well as very high-speed flight.\n\nThe Sabre could dramatically reduce intercontinental flight times.
