It has been an extraordinary pop culture phenomenon since its launch in 2017, is arguably the most popular game in the world today, and has made its developer Epic bucketloads of cash.\n\nThe game is structured around so-called \"seasons\": While anyone can play for free on anything from the PS4 to the iPhone, it also runs 10-week seasons that tell a broader story and modify the game map, and which players can buy a \"battle pass\" for that helps them unlock cosmetic skins, items, and dances for their characters.\n\nThe black hole that destroyed the original map on Sunday was the culmination of Season 10, billed \"The End,\" and was the most drastic change Epic has made to the game to date. It built wild levels of hype for what might come next, with millions of users tuning it to watch it live.\n\nThe latest iteration of Fortnite, dubbed \"Chapter 2,\" is also restarting the season counter, launching a new \"Season 1\" on Monday.\n\nHere's the full trailer for Fortnite Chapter 2:", "description": "Two days after Fortnite was \"destroyed,\" it's back with a bunch of new features and a shiny new map.", "authors": ["Rob Price"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da59f4dcc4a0a14ff154892?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
