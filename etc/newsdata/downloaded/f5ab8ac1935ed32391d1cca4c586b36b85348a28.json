Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump called the impeachment inquiry against him a \u201clynching\u201d in a tweet Tuesday, drawing immediate criticism from those who don\u2019t see the relationship between a constitutional process and terrorism against black Americans.\n\n\u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nTrump was quickly rebuked by Democrats and at least one Republican for his shameless self-pity and ignorance of the legacy of lynching.\n\n\u201cYou think this impeachment is a LYNCHING? What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d tweeted Representative Bobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat who founded the state\u2019s chapter of the Black Panthers. \u201cDo you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet.\u201d\n\nDemocratic New York congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke tweeted: \u201cUsing this term draws up some of America\u2019s darkest history\u2014Trump is yet again a disgrace and massively offensive.\u201d\n\nSouthern Carolina Democrat Jim Clyburn was on CNN when Trump sent the tweet, and was asked to react. \u201cThat is one word no president ought to apply to himself,\u201d said Clyburn, who was a civil-rights activist before he reached his teens. \u201cI\u2019m not just a politician. I\u2019m a southern politician. I\u2019m a product of the South. I know the history of that word. That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using.\u201d\n\nIllinois Republican Adam Kinzinger tweeted that Trump \u201cshould retract\u201d his tweet immediately. \u201cWe can all disagree on the process, and argue merits,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut never should we use terms like \u2018lynching\u2019 here.\u201d\n\nAs more members of Congress were asked to react to Trump\u2019s tweet, reliable defenders emerged ready to get behind him. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty well accurate,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham. \u201cThis is a sham. This is a joke\u2026 So yeah, this is a lynching and in every sense this un-American\u2026\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz attempted to play Trump interpreter, telling reporters that \u201clynching\u201d is \u201cobviously a word with significant historical freight.\u201d He went on: \u201cThe connotation the president is carrying forward is a political mob seeking an outcome regardless of facts. And that I think is an objectively true description of what is happening in the House right now\u201d\n\nTrump has previously called the impeachment inquiry a \u201cfraud,\u201d a \u201choax,\u201d a \u201ccoup,\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d His escalation to \u201clynching\u201d comes as acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor is set to provide private testimony to the House Tuesday. In text messages with other U.S. diplomats released to Congress, Taylor wrote that it\u2019s \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s absurd comparison of the impeachment inquiry to lynching did not go over well with many members of Congress.", "authors": ["Adam K.
