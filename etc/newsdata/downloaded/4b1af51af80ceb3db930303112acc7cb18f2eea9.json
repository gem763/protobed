The yield curve refers to the slope of the line measuring interest rates at different maturities -- and an inverted curve has shorter maturities yielding more than longer ones.\n\nAnd when\u2019s enough cutting? \u201cA steeper curve (and un-inverted) curve along with a weaker dollar and higher commodity prices will tell us the Fed has done enough,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe trade-weighted dollar is nearly flat this year, and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s index of primary commodities has fallen 1% through September.\n\nThe buzz\n\nIt\u2019s a huge day on the economics calendar. At 8:15 a.m. Eastern, the ADP report on private-sector hiring is released, followed at 8:30 a.m. by the GDP numbers that could show 1.6% growth in the third quarter. The Federal Open Market Committee interest-rate decision is due at 2 p.m. and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell steps to the microphone at 2:30 p.m.\n\nMarkets will be focused on what conditions Powell attaches to further lowering of interest rates. \u201cIn effect, the threshold for cutting could change from not seeing an improvement in the data \u2013 which is how we interpreted the guidance from the past several meetings \u2013 to needing to see some further deterioration,\u201d said Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank. Incoming European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Germany and the Netherlands need to spend more.\n\nIndustrial bellwether General Electric GE, +0.00% said it narrowed its loss during the quarter as it raised its estimate of free cash flow for the year. After the close, tech behemoths Apple AAPL, -2.31% and Facebook FB, -0.05% report results.\n\nMarkets\n\nPerched just below record highs, U.S. stock futures ES00, +0.02% YM00, +0.01% were weaker Wednesday morning.\n\nGold futures GC00, +0.31% crept higher, edging up to $1,492 an ounce. Basically, markets have been quiet.\n\nRandom reads\n\nJohn Witherspoon, the actor with appearances in \u201cFriday\u201d and the animated series \u201cThe Boondocks,\u201d has died at age 77.\n\nThe big question heading into Game Seven of the baseball World Series \u2014 whether Nationals ace Max Scherzer be healthy enough to pitch.\n\nAnother streaming service set \u2014 AT&T\u2019s T, -1.12% HBO Max to launch in May for $15 a month.\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
