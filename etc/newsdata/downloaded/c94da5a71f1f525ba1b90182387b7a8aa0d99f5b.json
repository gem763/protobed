Mugabe branded him a \u201ctraitor\u201d.\n\nSoon after, protesters and military officers pressured Mugabe to step down in what was widely seen as a struggle between Mnangagwa\u2019s faction and loyalists to Grace inside the ruling Zanu-PF party.\n\nThe \u201cheroes\u201d monument, where more than 130 national figures are buried in black marble tombs, sits on a hilltop overlooking Harare. Mugabe\u2019s first wife, Sally is also buried there.", "description": "Service for Zimbabwe\u2019s founding president will be at National Sports Stadium", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bca470393871ffd1b6c030d68d2866c995071124/0_190_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8d23b8675a25f09f5303e08464a64925", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
