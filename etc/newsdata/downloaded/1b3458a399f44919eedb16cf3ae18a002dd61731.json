Just when we thought we were the good guys and the Iranians were the bad guys, here comes the ghostly, hopeless possibility of a Trump-Rouhani summit to remind us that the apparent lunatic is the US president and the rational, sane leader who is supposed to talk to him is the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran. All these shenanigans are fantasy, of course \u2013 like the \u201cimminent\u201d war between America and Iran \u2013 of which more later.\n\nAs for the Israelis, they don\u2019t want the man who thinks he might be \u201cKing of Israel\u201d talking to the Hitlerite Persians. They suddenly sprayed Iran\u2019s local Middle East proxies with drone-fired rockets \u2013 in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon \u2013 just in case the wretched, financially broken and inflation-doomed Iranians were tempted to chat to the crackpot in the White House. But the Israelis wasted their ammunition. Rouhani is not mad. America has to drop its sanctions against Iran if Trump wants to talk, he said.\n\nIt still amazes me that we have to take all this stuff at face value. No sooner had Trump waffled on about Rouhani being \u201cthe great negotiator\u201d than we saw all the White House correspondents dutifully taking this nonsense down in their notebooks \u2013 as if the American president was presidential, as if the old dream-bag was real, as if what he was saying had the slightest bearing on reality.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd when Rouhani made it clear that he was not interested in \u201cphoto-ops\u201d \u2013 an obvious allusion to the pictures of Trump and Little Rocket Man \u2013 what did the po-faced Washington Post tell us in its subsequent report? Why, that Rouhani had \u201cdashed hopes of a potential meeting with his US counterpart\u201d. Ye Gods! What \u201chopes\u201d do they still have in their homegrown crackpot president after these two and a half years of his threats and lies and racism? Have they learned nothing?\n\nIt\u2019s as if \u2013 for the American media \u2013 Trump is unhinged in Washington but a Kissinger the moment he lands in Biarritz (or London or Riyadh or Panmunjom or a Scottish golf course, or perhaps, one day, Greenland). And Rouhani \u2013 who may be a \u201cgreat negotiator\u201d but is also a very ruthless man \u2013 is therefore supposed to play the role of Iran\u2019s previous president, the raving, crazed, Holocaust-denying Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nIndeed, had Ahmadinejad\u2019s further political ambitions not been firmly crushed by his country\u2019s \u201csupreme leader\u201d, Ayatollah Khamenei, we might just have witnessed a meeting between two of the world\u2019s leading political nutcases. Ahmadinejad, it may be recalled, was the Iranian who claimed that a holy cloud was suspended over his head for 20 minutes when he addressed the United Nations in New York. Now that is a phenomenon which Trump may also have experienced \u2013 although at least he had the good sense not to tell us of it.\n\nAhmadinejad, you may also remember, was the president whose claim to have won the 2009 presidential elections brought millions of protestors onto the streets of Iranian cities until they were brutalised and imprisoned into submission. His cheeky smile, chipmunk eyes and Spanish armada beard could not persuade Iranians that the \u201calternative facts\u201d of his presidential victory were real.\n\nEveryone knew that Ahmadinejad would never be given a finger on any nuclear button \u2013 many doubted if he knew the difference between nuclear physics and electricity \u2013 but he provided at the time a hate figure to rival Gaddafi or any other of the ravers of the Middle East.\n\nBut now Trump wears Ahmadinejad\u2019s international mantle of insanity and the Iranian presidential seat is today held by a far more pragmatic individual. For let\u2019s not be romantic about Hassan Rouhani. Back in 1999, when he was a humble deputy chief of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, Rouhani condemned pro-democracy demonstrators as \u201cmuhareb\u201d and \u201cmofsad\u201d (corrupt on earth) \u2013 opponents of the Islamic Republic, whose punishment would be death.\n\nIn the first eight months after Rouhani became president in 2013, the Iranian state hanged at least 537 people. In January of 2014, he had, according to a report in the Arabic daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, visited Ahwaz to deal with \u201ca number of sensitive files\u201d left untouched by Ahmadinejad. These included Hashem Shaabani and Hadi Rashedi \u2013 both human rights activists in the minority Arab community in southwest Iran \u2013 who had been condemned to death for \u201cwaging war on God\u201d, \u201cspreading corruption on earth\u201d and \u201cquestioning the principle of velayat-e faqih\u201d (guardianship of the jurist).\n\nShaabani\u2019s poetry, in both Persian and Arabic, was famous; he was a founder of an institute which encouraged Arabic literature and culture among Iranians. Rouhani signed off on the executions; Shaabani and Rashedi were hanged in a still-unidentified prison.\n\nBut it is Rouhani\u2019s negotiating skill which has apparently impressed Trump, who also has little time for minorities. And when you recall that one of Trump\u2019s Republican predecessors in the White House, Ronald Reagan, arranged for the Israelis to deliver missiles to Iran in 1985 in return for the release of US hostages in Beirut, you can see why Trump might think it strange that Rouhani would turn down a meeting with him. After all, during the Iran-Contra affair the then Iranian speaker of parliament, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was deeply involved in the enterprise.\n\nBut even if Rouhani was fool enough to flirt with Trump\u2019s offer \u2013 which he was not \u2013 his fate would have been similar to the poet Shaabani\u2019s if he had dared to talk to the US president without the full restoration of the nuclear treaty.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much spreading of \u201ccorruption on earth\u201d in Iran \u2013 let alone disavowing the views of the Supreme Leader Khamanei \u2013 to catapult a learned cleric into prison. Having learned from his foreign minister in Biarritz what the American deal was supposed to be, Rouhani wisely did not touch it. The US had broken the nuclear treaty and reimposed sanctions \u2013 so Trump would have to rejoin the treaty signatories and lift sanctions for any hope of a meeting with the president of the Islamic Republic.\n\nOf course, the Iranians will no more go to war with America than America will go to war with Iran. We all know that \u2013 except for those who blast us all with \u201cbrink-of-war\u201d scenarios in the Gulf. We\u2019ve been through Iranian ship-minings in 1987 without declarations of war. Besides, what\u2019s so new about an Iran insisting on its \u201csovereign\u201d right to peaceful nuclear power?\n\nWhen the shah of Iran wanted to acquire nuclear technology in 1974, according to documents in the US National Security Archive, he said that Iran had an \u201cinalienable right\u201d to the nuclear cycle and that it would not accept obligations \u201cdictated by the nuclear-have nations\u201d.\n\nWhich is pretty much what Iran did accept in the nuclear agreement which Trump tore up on behalf of the United States. And I still have a clipping from The Times of November 1972, in which my then colleague David Housego was reporting from Tehran that the shah had declared that Iran\u2019s defensive frontiers extended beyond the Persian Gulf into the Indian Ocean!\n\nIn five years, the shah calculated, his arms build-up would make Iran the largest military power in the Middle East. The shah ruled with torture and executions, was crazed about the dangers of communism, and power-mad to the extent of celebrating his empire\u2019s rule in 1971 with what he called \u201cthe biggest party on earth\u201d in the ruins of Persepolis. How Trump would love to have been there.\n\nWell, Macron may be able to turn himself into the \u201cGreat G7 Intermediary\u201d, although all others who have tangled with Iran have been brought low by the experience. Think poor old Jimmy Carter, destroyed by the hostage-takers at the US embassy in Tehran. Think Reagan, almost brought low by Irangate. Think Colonel Oliver North. Or envoy Robert McFarlane. Or Terry Waite. Or Barack Obama, for that matter, his Iranian policy torn up by Trump.\n\nIn theory, what Macron is trying to do, if Le Monde has got it right, is persuade Trump to allow Iran\u2019s principal petroleum importers to continue buying oil from the Islamic Republic. This includes Turkey, China, Japan, India and South Korea. In return, Iran would itself return to the original nuclear agreement. That\u2019s the message Macron sent back to Tehran with Iran\u2019s foreign minister, who airbussed into Biarritz for his briefest of meetings with the French president.\n\nBut what Macron is really doing \u2013 which is what almost every EU leader is doing \u2013 is trying to preserve the peace of the Middle East long enough for the Americans to elect a serious, intelligent, boring and moderately honest political leader to replace the mentally unbalanced and very dangerous current holder of the highest office in the US.\n\nWell, good luck to the Americans. For at present, they are confronting not the lunatic rogue state which Messers Bolton and Pompeo have nightmared up for Trump, but a nation governed by bravely defiant, ruthless, and \u2013 yes \u2013 devious men. For Iranians understand America far better than Americans will ever understand Iran.", "description": "History in the Middle East is unkind to us westerners. Just when we thought we were the good guys and the Iranians were the bad guys, here comes the ghostly, hopeless possibility of a Trump-Rouhani summit to remind us that the apparent lunatic is the US president and the rational, sane leader who is supposed to talk to him is the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
