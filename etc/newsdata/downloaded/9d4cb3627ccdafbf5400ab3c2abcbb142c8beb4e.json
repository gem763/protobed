The campaign has been expanded to build more public toilets in cities, renovate existing toilets and build better ones in rural areas later.\n\nAccording to the city's environment and sanitation bureau, the new toilets are distributed in the city's streets with large flow of people, and the project has been gaining popularity among residents and tourists.\n\nThe locations of the new toilets are in the city's Yuthok Road, the Yingqin Bridge, the South Ring Road, Chumig Road, and Sera Road.\n\nEach toilet is also equipped with a barrier-free toilet, and each toilet can satisfy a daily demand of more than 100 people.\n\nAccording to the environment and sanitation bureau of the city's Chengguan District, the district has more than 190 public toilets and 173 toilet managers.\n\n\"The operation of eco-friendly toilets has brought big conveniences for us,\" said Tseyang, a Lhasa resident. \"We no longer have to worry, finding a public toilet on the Ngachen Road was an issue for people in the past.\"\n\n\"The new toilet is equipped with auxiliary facilities including clothes-hooks, ventilators and lighting facilities for the convenience of users,\" she said happily.\n\nTashi Tsomo, another resident of the city, said the newly operated toilet was very clean, convenient, and just like the flush-free toilets on trains and planes.\n\n\"I have never thought a toilet would be so beautiful, and we will enjoy the new advanced high-tech multifunctional toilets,\" she said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db165e5a310cf3e97a2ce78.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
