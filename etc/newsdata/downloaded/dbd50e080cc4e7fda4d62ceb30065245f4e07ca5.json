Yet the DEA, which sets annual quotas for narcotic painkillers produced in the United States, authorized a 400 percent increase in oxycodone output between 2002 and 2013, Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said, and it didn\u2019t begin cutting back until 2017.\n\nDrug companies accused of allowing billions of pills to be diverted to the street have long argued that they produced only as many as the DEA allowed each year. The issue is certain to come up at a landmark civil trial of some of those companies that is scheduled to begin in Cleveland this month.\n\nFor their part, DEA officials have said that their estimates are based on data provided by the companies, and the real problem was the failure of some of those companies to prevent diversion of the pills, as required by federal law and regulations. They also have said that cutting back the overall supply risked denying legitimate pain patients the drugs they need if shortages were inadvertently created.\n\nHorowitz also found that when licenses to handle narcotics are stripped from drug manufacturers, distributors and health care practitioners, they can reapply for that authority as soon as one day later.\n\nThe report criticized the DEA for cutting back on the use of it most powerful deterrent, immediate suspension orders, between 2013 and 2017, at a time when deaths were skyrocketing. The DEA issued more of the orders \u2014 which allow them to instantly halt shipment of pain pills from a distributor \u2014 in 2012 than it did from 2013 to 2017.\n\nThe Washington Post revealed the sharp decline in immediate suspension orders in 2016, citing conflict between field offices that sought to use that power and the DEA\u2019s legal office, which was setting up roadblocks.\n\nThe Post reported in 2017 that under heavy lobbying from the drug industry, Congress approved a change in federal law that made use of the orders almost impossible. President Obama signed the law, apparently without the government\u2019s drug regulators recognizing what it would mean.\n\nIn a written response, the DEA said it has taken away about 900 licenses--known as \u201cregistrations\u201d-- each year over the past eight years, \u201cpreventing further diversion of controlled substances.\u201d In concert with federal prosecutors, the agency has brought civil and criminal charges against more companies and practitioners accused of fueling the opioid crisis, spokeswoman Mary A. Brandenberger said.\n\nThe statement said the DEA \u201csecured more than $194 million in civil penalties\u201d in fiscal 2017, \u201cmore than the total of the prior seven years combined.\u201d Brandenberger said that in the past three years, the DEA has sharply reduced production levels of opioids, while prescriptions for those drugs have declined by more than 36 percent between January 2017 to August 2019.\n\nRead more\n\nThe DEA database: See where the pain pills went\n\nOpioid crackdown forces patients to taper off drugs they say they need\n\nHow an epic legal battle brought a drug database to light\n\nNew research shows some chronic pain is not in backs or knees but brains", "description": "Inspector General\u2019s report also cites weakness in the licensing process for drug manufacturers, distributors and health care providers.", "authors": ["Lenny Bernstein", "Reporter Covering Health", "October At Am", "Lenny Bernstein Covers Health", "Medicine.
