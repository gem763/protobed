All of them are campaigning against Trump and most have called for his impeachment. Yet getting the chance to challenge the incumbent president requires first winning the nomination. So many of the candidates have criticized Biden for \u201callowing\u201d Hunter Biden to serve on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was vice president, saying any appearance of a conflict of interest is problematic.\n\nBiden has thoroughly disputed any allegations, and no evidence suggests that there was any impropriety when he worked in concert with other Obama administration officials and European allies to recommend that Ukraine\u2019s national prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, be fired.\n\nAides to some of the other candidates in the debate say they do not expect their candidates to shy away from repeating their public criticisms.\n\nSenator Kamala Harris of California, who sparred with Biden in the first debate over his past positions on busing, said she would \u201cprobably not\u201d let a child of her vice president sit on the board of a foreign energy company.\n\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey told CNN last month, \u201cI just don\u2019t think children of vice presidents, presidents during the administration should be out there doing that.\u201d\n\nAfter a labor forum in Los Angeles last week, former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cI would not allow a family member, anyone in my cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that.\u201d\n\nHowever, one spokesman for a Democratic debate participant said Democrats have learned from 2016 to tread carefully around using Trump\u2019s attacks on other Democrats because that could sow division. The aide said attacking Biden on the Ukraine issue could result in benefiting Trump in 2020, whoever becomes the nominee.\n\n\u201cThere will be plenty of other opportunities in this debate to draw policy differences with Joe Biden,\u201d said Adam Green, the co-founder of Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a supporter of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. \u201cWhen it comes to the issue of Ukraine, I\u2019d expect 100% of the attention to be on impeachment and holding Trump accountable for his corruption.\u201d\n\nStill, campaigns are getting ready, with debate moderators eager to pinpoint differences among the candidates.\n\nAt the same time, the candidates who have most aggressively attacked Biden in past debates have been the ones to leave wounded.\n\nIn the first debate in July, Harris briefly surged in the polls after eviscerating him for fondly recalling his ability to work with segregationists when he was in the Senate.\n\nIn August, she, Booker and Julian Castro tried the same tactic and it backfired. Castro made another attempt in the September debate with an aggressive jab at Biden\u2019s age and memory and only succeeded in drawing criticism from some prominent Democrats.\n\nBernie Sanders, a Vermont senator, upbraided Biden early and pointedly on his votes for the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Iraq War. But he, too, failed to gain from it, and surveys have shown him been stuck in the mid-teens since May.\n\nThe failed attempts to take down a popular rival have made Democratic campaign operatives wary of going negative. Their voters don\u2019t want to see the party bloodied before it faces Trump in the general election.\n\nThe only Democrat who has consistently gained support since the beginning of summer is Warren, who has actively avoided combat with her rivals.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden has a warning for his Democratic rivals as they prepare for the fourth televised debate next week: Stay away from the issue of Ukraine and Hunter Biden.The 12 candidates participating in Tuesday\u2019s debate in Westerville, Ohio, are honing their answers to questions about the U.S", "authors": ["Tyler Pager", "Sahil Kapur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0cSsOVMsM__DoV8JQvL8DA--~B/aD0xMzA5O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/c3165c77dac88bccffa2424b33b2d95e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
