The England No 8, born of Tongan heritage, felt the full wrath of what it means to play against the Pacific Islanders, yet joined them after the final whistle for their regular post-match prayer.\n\n\u201cIt is something that just happens,\u201d Vunipola said. \u201cIt is not something that you force. We just kind of went into a prayer. I was happy to share that moment with some of the boys from Tonga and happy to play against them.\n\n\u201cI still have to play the same. The only difference would be the emotional state that I came into the game with. I felt like I played well. It was good to get the win.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

England may have won comfortably, but what the 35-3 scoreline doesn\u2019t reveal is the bruises that will be counted up on Monday morning, Vunipola included.\n\nThe 26-year-old was on the receiving end of a huge tackle from Tongan flanker Zane Kepeli early in the first half that stopped the England forward in his tracks, bringing a sharp intake of breath from the 35,923 in attendance inside the Sapporo Dome.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They are a tough team who put it all out there. I thought we showed a lot of control as well.\n\n\u201cIt was probably my fault as well. I told Fordy [George Ford] to give me the ball. I gave him [Kepeli] the opportunity and he took it.\u201d\n\nThe week leading up to the Pool C encounter featured plenty of talk about the Tongans pride and passion, which stretches out far beyond the game. For Kepeli, there was something quite motivating in playing opposite a man who could easily be playing on his side.\n\n\u201cI have not seen the footage, but I definitely remember the tackle,\u201d Kepeli said. \u201cI just put my head down and hoped for the best. I was looking for the ice for the shoulder afterwards, but I am very proud to representing Tonga on the world stage.\n\n\u201cI was not thinking too much about the details in using my arm. I don\u2019t think there was much arms in there to be honest. I just wanted to go all in!\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of edge facing other Tonga fellas, but I am just grateful to play against a top quality side like England. Some Saturdays before a club game I am working with tools, so I am just grateful to be here full-time rugby training. I just feel like I am gaining more confidence as every game comes.\u201d\n\nFor Vunipola, he has now strung together 10 consecutive starts for England, having missed the bulk of the 2017/18 season through injury. The back-row forward has restored his place as a pivotal figurehead in this England side, but that has not stopped Tonga from talking about what he could still offer the island.\n\nWith World Rugby currently discussing the possibility of allowing players to play for more than one country \u2013 such as the Pacific Islanders who get called up by one of rugby\u2019s global giants only to then be lost to the international game when they could play for a smaller nation \u2013 Vunipola could find himself in a situation where he is eligible to represent Tonga.\n\nBut, he stresses, even the thought of it would be unfair to both England and Tonga.\n\n\u201cM focus is solely on England,\u201d he added. \u201cI am who I am. I am proud to represent England and hopefully I gave a good account of myself out there.\n\n\u201cI think that would be unfair on Tonga that if I get discarded then I would go to Tonga. For me I worked my whole life to be where I am now. It is not something that I will just turn around and say I am done, I am going to go represent Tonga now. It would be disrespectful for me to say that. I am very proud to be in the changing room I am in now but also I know who I am and where I come from.\u201d", "description": "In what was a special day for Billy Vunipola, it ended with a special moment.
