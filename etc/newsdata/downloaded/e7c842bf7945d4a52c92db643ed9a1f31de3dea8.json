Tiger Roll's sire was Derby winner Authorized, Red Rum's a sprinter called Quorum.\n\nThey were bred for full-on speed and Red Rum even won a five-furlong seller at Aintree on Grand National day in 1967.\n\nTiger Roll emulated Red Rum by winning back-to-back Grand Nationals at Aintree on Saturday\n\nThe legendary Red Rum wins his third Grand National at Aintree back in 1977\n\nTiger Roll would have been running at Ascot, Epsom or Newmarket in the minds of the people who bought him for first owner Sheik Mohammed, but he never raced on the Flat.\n\nTrainer Martin Pipe, my old boss, used to say that sometimes the ability in the genes of the top stallions showed itself as stamina rather than speed, and that looks to be the case with these two Grand National greats.\n\nDesert Orchid, another jump racing legend, was also sired by a sprinter, Grey Mirage. Plenty will argue that the more formidable fences in the day of Red Rum \u2014 the back-to-back winner in 1973 and 1974 who became the only three-time winner in 1977 \u2014 make him the better jumper.\n\nTiger Roll with trainer Gordon Elliott (left) and owner Michael O'Leary on Sunday\n\nYet, while the core of the fences has been softened, the present-day Aintree fences are also bigger than a steeple chaser will gallop towards at any other track.\n\nWho knows how Red Rum would fare these days? Any reduction in the jumping challenge has been counter-balanced by the fact the race is run at a faster tempo.\n\nGone are the days when you tried to survive the first circuit and raced hard on the second lap. The modern-day National is probably a truer test of stamina and that is one of Tiger Roll's strengths.\n\nI was proud of the sixth place of One For Arthur, trained by my partner Lucinda Russell. He ran a stormer after a season off with injury following his 2017 win and an interrupted current campaign this time. Hopefully, we can get him back to Aintree with a better preparation in 2020.", "description": "PETER SCUDAMORE: Inevitably, pundits and racegoers are comparing Tiger Roll and Red Rum, but the biggest link between the two can be summed up in one word: class.", "authors": ["Peter Scudamore For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/07/21/11979738-0-image-a-34_1554670652359.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-07"}
