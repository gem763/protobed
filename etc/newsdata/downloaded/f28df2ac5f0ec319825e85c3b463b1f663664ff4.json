After the 49ers\u2019 convincing 31-3 victory, he for real planted a 49ers\u2019 flag in the end zone.\n\nThen, for good measure, he trolled the Browns quarterback in his postgame media session.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI was kind of trying to talk [to Mayfield],\u201d Bosa said, via Eric Branch of the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cI don\u2019t usually talk, but this game he had it coming. He didn\u2019t say one word back.\n\n\u201cI was just screaming his name like, \u2018Baaaaaker. Baaaaaker. You good? Step it up. We want a challenge.'\u201d\n\nBosa hasn\u2019t forgotten what the Buckeyes considered an act of disrespect in 2017 when, after Oklahoma\u2019s victory at Ohio State, Mayfield planted an OU flag at midfield.\n\nBosa said he planned on a flag-planting gesture all week, because Mayfield \u201chad it coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI practiced a little bit in my room,\u201d Bosa said, via Omar Ruiz of the NFL. \u201cIt was pretty accurate. I mean, the image was in my head pretty good, so I had an idea.\u201d\n\nBosa got to Mayfield on the final play of the first half, wrapping up the quarterback\u2019s ankles and bringing him down. Although it appeared Mayfield\u2019s knees were down before he threw away the pass, officials ruled it intentional grounding instead.\n\nBosa\u2019s celebration mocked Mayfield\u2019s celebration from two years ago. (Though it surely left many Buckeyes torn.)\n\n\u201cEveryone knows what that was for,\u201d Bosa said. \u201cIt was payback.\u201d\n\nMayfield didn\u2019t have much to say about Bosa\u2019s celebration after the game.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that until I was informed before I got up here,\u201d Mayfield said, via Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland Plain Dealer. \u201cGood for him. Good play.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nMayfield had three turnovers, 100 passing yards, a 13.4 passer rating and took four sacks and eight quarterback hits. Bosa, who was off the injury report last week for the first time this season, had four tackles, two sacks, two tackles for loss, five quarterback hits, a forced fumble and a recovered fumble.\n\n\u201cHe was panicking,\u201d Bosa said of Mayfield. \u201cHe was double-clutching, rolling back and forth. We had him rattled all game.\u201d\n\nBosa became the only 49ers player in the past 25 years with two sacks, a forced fumble and fumble recovery in a single game, per ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nIt\u2019s just too bad the Browns and 49ers won\u2019t meet again for another four years (unless it\u2019s in a Super Bowl), because this rivalry has gotten good.", "description": "Before the Browns were done even waving the white flag by removing Baker Mayfield from Monday night's game, Nick Bosa was planting the 49ers' flag.
