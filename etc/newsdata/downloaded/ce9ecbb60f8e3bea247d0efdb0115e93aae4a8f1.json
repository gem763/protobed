They were supposed to win this World Series. If they don\u2019t win Game 7, they will be piling all their \u201cTake It Back\u201d pins, trinkets and assorted other sundries to garage sales in the greater Houston area this winter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlso, thank Max Scherzer, who threw in the outfield before Game 6, said, \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d then loosened up in the bullpen during the game. For Game 7, Nats Manager Dave Martinez made it simple and electric: \u201cMax will start.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, the awful luck of Scherzer\u2019s stiff neck preventing him from starting Game 5 may be a major good break, not a bad one. Instead of facing Gerrit Cole at his best, he will face Zack Greinke, who has been mediocre in the postseason his whole career, including this October. Next question: How good can Max be 72 hours after a cortisone shot to get his neck out of spasm and with seven days of rest since his start in Game 1?\n\nGet ready An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez \u2014 who would be on his normal day to start \u2014 and Patrick Corbin who, on three days\u2019 rest, should be good for a couple of innings if needed. Also, Sean Doolittle, who got the last two outs Tuesday night, and Daniel Hudson are all in that long Nats line of pitchers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, suddenly, it is the Astros who have burned their two aces \u2014 Verlander, who threw 93 pitches in Game 6 and, to a degree, Cole, who would have two days of rest.\n\nIs this all getting magnificently nuts enough for you? Washington waits 86 years for a World Series, then endures three straight defeats at Nationals Park in which Washington scores a total of three runs.\n\nThen what happens!? One of the great Game 6s arrives in a sport in which \u201cGame 6\u201d grabs your attention instantly for its long, fabulous controversial history. This one fits right in with the best of them. Baseball and D.C., shake hands. This is the real deal. This is what it feels like. One game, one title.\n\nAD\n\nLet\u2019s not hurry because there are more important people to thank \u2014 especially Astros third baseman Alex Bregman, whose blatant show-\u2019em-up hot-dogging, carrying his bat around first base on his first-inning home run trot before finally dropping his club on his way to second base, became a classic don\u2019t-wake-the-sleeping-dogs moment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Martinez said in what amounts to a filibuster for him.\n\nIf the Astros had won this game, Bregman simply would have added the latest tiny increment in mankind\u2019s trek toward the day that a hitter celebrates himself and his home run by twirling his bat like a baton all the way around the bases while also juggling his shoes.\n\nAD\n\nBut now, after the Nats\u2019 silent anger at Bregman and their comeback after he had insulted them, the Astros will have an additional problem. Bregman, perhaps their best player this year and one of the game\u2019s most-liked and brightest ambassadors, has \u2014 if the Astros lose \u2014 put a dunce cap on his own head that will linger for years.\n\nFrom that Bregman instant, every Nats at-bat felt like a personal battle \u2014 an affront being repaid \u2014 as the Nats drove future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander out of the game after just five innings. Eaton\u2019s homer off the 300-strikeout man tied the game at 2. But it was Soto\u2019s homer a moment later, into the second deck, that revealed what was motivating these Nats.\n\nAD\n\nAs Soto ran to first, with the Nats in the lead 3-2, he duplicated all of Bregman\u2019s actions \u2014 carrying the bat, extending it toward the first base coach. But unlike Bregman, who never executed his baton-pass handoff to his coach and ended up carrying his bat 15 more feet toward second base, Soto pointedly dropped his bat before he got to first base \u2014 the general custom since 1868, rarely broken until Bregman added his attention-on-me twist.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like that either,\u201d Martinez said of the payback show-up. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Juan about it. We like to keep our celebrating in our dugout.\u201d\n\nAstros Manager A.J. Hinch summarized the game simply \u2014 too simply and conveniently \u2014 but a synopsis nonetheless: \u201cThey hit the ball out of the ballpark multiple times. And we ran into Strasburg. . . . He\u2019s an incredible pitcher. . . . He\u2019s got a slow heartbeat out there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDoes Hinch want Bregman carrying his bat past first base? \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t carry his bat past first base,\u201d said Hinch. \u201cBut Soto shouldn\u2019t carry his bat to first base either.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s probably true. But who did it first? Somebody find a second-grade teacher to adjudicate this one.\n\nAD\n\nAll of these moments, in traditional analysis of a World Series game, would encapsulate the heart of the story. Then you would add that Rendon\u2019s home run was a huge, monumental tension-lifter, giving the Nats a three-run lead in the seventh with nine outs to go.\n\nBut this was no normal home run. Two batters previously, Gary Cederstrom\u2019s umpiring crew made a call that defied common sense, enraged the Nats, eventually led to Martinez\u2019s ejection and precipitated a 4-minute 32-second discussion about the play. In the end, the call stood. Instead of Nats at second and third with no outs in a one-run game, Trea Turner had been called out for interference with the Astros first baseman and the Nats had only one man on base \u2014 at first.\n\nAD\n\nOn that controversial play, the Astros did everything wrong and were rewarded spectacularly. With Yan Gomes on first, Turner hit a dribbler that pitcher Brad Peacock threw to the inside of first base. A dozen replays showed that Turner would have beaten the play to first by about a foot and that, at the time the off-target throw arrived, first baseman Yuli Gurriel was being pulled into Turner\u2019s path to reach for the ball. The throw hit Turner in the right leg just as Gurriel\u2019s glove collided with Turner\u2019s left leg.\n\nAD\n\nThe umpires ruled that Turner had interfered with Gurriel\u2019s attempt at a catch. Turner went berserk. The Houston press box was filled with scribes trying to remember whether a team had ever done so much incorrectly and been rewarded so richly. When Eaton made the second out, it appeared that \u2014 even if a thousand rules debates decided the call could not be reviewed or a dozen other whatnots \u2014 the sense of the play, any sense of a fair resolution, had been blown up.\n\nWhat was blown up was this close game when Rendon, who had been in a slump before a first-inning RBI single poked to right, smashed a Will Harris offering high and deep into the Crawford boxes in left field for a 5-2 Nats lead. The emotionally justified Nats erupted in cheers, especially Turner. General Manager Mike Rizzo, who had been screaming from the box seats, could calm down.\n\nAD\n\nAfter that, all moral, baseball or other lessons in this game pointed in the Nationals\u2019 direction. It seemed that no hurdle was too high. At least not for this night.\n\nAD\n\nNot on the night that the Nationals desperately needed to avoid elimination \u2014 for the fourth time in this postseason \u2014 to force a Game 7. In ways that baseball will not forget for a long time, they found ways to do it.\n\nAll World Series have one key point that sets the direction of momentum \u2014 such as the Nats\u2019 wins here in Games 1 and 2. Many battles have a second major shift when the team that once seemed in control suddenly seems behind the eight-ball \u2014 as the Nats did coming back here. It is rare, it is almost unheard of, for World Series momentum to have three major shifts \u2014 with the third being in the Nats\u2019 direction now.\n\nIt has happened. But the more you know and love World Series history, the better you know that the Nats slept well after Game 6.\n\nRead more:", "description": "The Houston third baseman\u2019s rare moment of braggadocio backfired spectacularly by fueling Washington\u2019s rally and sending World Series to a Game 7.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RLMb2bK7OWg5NIG1hBRSjDDDHls=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KXFFDTH22EI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
