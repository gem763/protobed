When he sobered up he claimed he could barely remember the incident.\n\n(Image: Benjamin Hoyle/Cavendish Press)\n\nAfter staggering to the departure gate with a drunken friend, Hoyle began verbally abusing and threatening staff when he told he wasn't allowed on the plane.\n\nAs families looked on, the Royal marine, who had booked a \u00a32,000 holiday with an \"old friend\", ranted at Swissport supervisor Kerry Boardman: \"What? Are you f***ing kidding? What the f*** you on about, you f***ing slag.\n\n\"Look at you with your Primark shoes on. I\u2019m wanting a refund, give me a f***ing refund. I am going to get you tomorrow, you f***ing b****.\u201d\n\nHoyle, from Birkenhead, Wirral, added: \u201cI\u2019m in the Marines. I could f***ing take all of you out. Look at you at you sat there, you f***ing mugs. Let\u2019s f*** off back to Liverpool ... fat f***ing tart with Primark shoes on.\u201d\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press)\n\nHe told Andrew Bradley, the woman's male colleague: \u201cYou better shut the f*** up or I\u2019m going to take you all down, you f***ing queer with a wig on.\n\n\"I could f***ing kill you all if I wanted. I fought for you, you should be ashamed.\u201d\n\nAt Manchester Magistrates' Court, Hoyle admitted racially aggravated threatening behaviour and other public order offences.\n\nHe was ordered to complete 130 hours unpaid work as part of 12 months community order. He was also ordered to pay Miss Boardman and Mr Bradley \u00a350 in compensation, plus \u00a3135 in costs and surcharges.\n\nThe incident occurred on June 19 at Gate 53 at Manchester Airport's Terminal 3.\n\n(Image: Benjamin Hoyle/Cavendish Press)\n\nStephen Varle, prosecuting, said: \"Miss Boardman was working alongside colleagues and Mr Bradley informed her that he had observed somebody who didn\u2019t appear to be in a fit state to board the flight.\n\n\"He was falling about the place as he made his way to board the flight.\n\n\"He asked, 'Is this where I get my flight?'\n\n\"But she then asked him to take a seat as she didn\u2019t believe he was fit to get on board due to the level of intoxication.\n\n\"She then observed a second male approaching the gate 15 metres away, stumbling and swaying.\n\n(Image: Benjamin Hoyle/Cavendish Press)\n\n\"The male was extremely intoxicated and having difficulty walking in a straight line.\n\n\"She observed him for approximately 20 seconds until he arrived at the gate.\n\n\"He was a lot taller then her and looking down with a glazed look in his eyes and a stare like she wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\"He was swaying from side to side and Miss Boardman said, 'Can you move to the side you have had too much to drink', but she observed the males and they seemed to be confused by the nature of the incident.\n\n\"She said, 'Lads you are far too intoxicated to get in this flight', but the response was, 'What the f*** you on about?'\"\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press)\n\nOther passengers were \"happy these males would not be boarding the flight\" and Miss Boardman only felt safe when the police arrived, the court heard.\n\nMr Varle said of Hoyle: \"He was getting in peoples faces and the opinion from Andrew Bradley was that he tried to kiss a female passenger. He was then arrested.\"\n\nHoyle told police he had four cans of beer on the train and after arriving at the airport around 6pm he had further pints at the bar and bought a 70cl bottle of Captain Morgan rum at duty free for another drink mixed with Coke.\n\nHe claimed he was \"2.5 drunk\" on a scale of one to ten, adding: \u201cI would not have used those sort of words. I have homosexual friends. This doesn\u2019t seem right, I wouldn\u2019t have said that. That\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nIn mitigation, defence lawyer Miss Lina Tsui-Cheung said: \"He was extremely intoxicated and cannot believe he would have said such hurtful remarks.\n\n\"He wishes for me to express his full and deep remorse for his actions and wishes to apologise to those particular workers at the airport and members of the public who where present. This is an extremely out of character, and isolated incident.\"\n\nMiss Tsui-Cheung said Hoyle was \"irate\" after being told he couldn't board the plane because he had spent \u00a32,000 on his holiday.\n\nDespite claiming that he didn't remember threatening or verbally abusing staff, he alleged that staff were \"were smirking and laughing\" at him and he \"felt goaded\", the court heard.\n\nMiss Tsui-Cheung said Hoyle has been in the Army for seven years and has spent the past year with the Royal Marines while completing final courses before being referred to full service.\n\nMirror Online has contacted the Ministry of Defence for comment.", "description": "Benjamin Hoyle, 35, called a male worker a \"f***ing queer with a wig on\" and racially abused the man's Asian colleague", "authors": ["Sophie Wheeler", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Benjamin Hoyle Cavendish Press", "Cavendish Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663523.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Cavendish-Press-Manchester-Ltd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
