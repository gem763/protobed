The five-year-old, who has lived with her grandparents in Tehran since 2016, will be back in London before Christmas, according to the Times.\n\nZaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 and sentenced to five years in jail for spying, which she denies. During her fight to be released, which has been at the centre of a diplomatic row, she has endured solitary confinement and undertaken hunger strikes.\n\nHer family told the Times that they agreed Gabriella should return to the UK to start the school year in September, but postponed the decision after Zaghari-Ratcliffe was taken to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nShe was returned to prison after a week but not permitted phone calls with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, in London.\n\nZaghari-Ratcliffe has pleaded with the Iranian authorities to release her so she can go to London with Gabriella.\n\n\u201cI have no hope or motivation after my baby goes. There is no measure to my pain,\u201d she wrote in a letter addressed to \u201cthe mothers of Iran\u201d that was smuggled out of Evin prison and published online in Farsi and English.\n\n\u201cIn the near future, my baby will leave me to go to her father and start school in the UK. It will be a daunting trip for her travelling and me left behind,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cAnd the authorities who hold me will watch on, unmoved at the injustice of separation. That first day at school is not for me.\u201d\n\nRatcliffe said his wife was giving up weekly visits with Gabriella to allow her to live in Britain, where she was born.\n\nIn July, more than 200 MPs called for Boris Johnson to use his powers to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release.\n\nIn a much-criticised error, Johnson said in 2017 that she was in Iran \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d, despite her family\u2019s insistence that she was there to visit relatives.", "description": "Gabriella, five, to leave Iran where mother remains in jail on charges of spying, reports say", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60571fc20d2518c54c83dff3c3f4522838471b43/0_387_2220_1331/master/2220.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9e1f59d910036d64e693d79d0420fb80", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
