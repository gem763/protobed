Susan Collins (R-ME) on Saturday joined her colleague Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) in condemning President Donald Trump for suggesting China investigate the dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, calling the move \u201ccompletely inappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent. \u2026 It\u2019s completely inappropriate,\u201d Collins told the Bangor Daily News.\n\nThe Maine Republican\u2019s comments come after President Trump said China should investigate the Biden family for alleged corruption.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as Ukraine,\u201d the president told reporters outside the White House ahead of a visit to Florida to deliver remarks on Medicare.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment company secured a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013.\n\nPresident Trump also re-upped his call for Ukraine to look into the Biden family\u2019s dealings in the eastern European country.\n\n\u201cI would think that if they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation\u201d into the former second family, the president replied when asked if Ukraine should also probe into the Bidens. \u201cNobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked; that was a crooked deal, 100 percent.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News reported earlier this year:\n\nBiden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son\u2019s role.)\n\nCollins\u2019 criticism came one day after Romney proclaimed that President Trump\u2019s suggestion for foreign governments to look into Biden\u2019s dealings \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nThe Utah Republican wrote on Twitter Friday:\n\nWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated. By all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) was the first Republican senator to come out against the president highlighting the Biden\u2019s alleged corruption, saying in a statement Thursday that \u201cAmericans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth\u201d", "description": "Susan Collins joined Sen.
