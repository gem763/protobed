The guy in the bookie's wrote it out for me.\n\n\"My mate kept the betting slip. We never dreamed that it would ever come in.\n\n\"I never thought Salford would finish top five, but I did have an inkling about Hastings winning the Man of Steel. I am a massive Salford fan. I sponsor Tyrone McCarthy and the Devils' mascot.\n\n\"I was on holiday abroad when we beat Wigan to get to the Grand Final and then Jackson won his title. I was made up. Even Jackson's mum was pleased for me.\n\n\"Then she sent me a message after reading what William Hill had said and said she was gutted.\n\n(Image: Magi Haroun/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"William Hill have now said they regard our bet as two \u00a350 bets and are prepared to pay out \u00a31,700 to each of us.\n\n\"I am not settling for that. I will take it all the way, The Chief Executive of William Hill has refused to speak to me.\n\n\"Kris and I were so elated at the weekend. now we are so annoyed after coming down with a massive thud on Monday.\n\n\"I went back to the branch where I placed the bet and the person who wrote it out for me said he 'must have been half asleep' when he did it.\"\n\n(Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nA spokesman for William Hill said: \u201cAs stated in our rules, a related contingency occurs when one or more parts of the bet placed affect the outcome of the bet.\n\n\"In this case, the prices of Jackson Hasting winning Man of Steel and Salford finishing in the top five are related. Were one outcome to happen, the other would be directly affected and as such the double price would be significantly smaller.\n\n\u201cThis bet has been struck as a result of human error and as such has been corrected. At no point was the double on offer before the start of the season. Unfortunately, we realise this is disappointing for the customer and we can only apologise.\n\n\u201cIn cases such as this, IBAS (Independent Betting Adjudication Service) offer an impartial adjudication on disputes between customers and licensed gambling operators.\u201d", "description": "Gary Smeaton and best pal, Kris Shenton, backed their team back in January when the odds were firmly against them", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Manchester Evening News", "Magi Haroun Rex Shutterstock", "Corbis Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20541221.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pals-Gary-Smeaton-and-best-mate-Kris-Shenton-thought-theyd-won-\u00a323400-on-Salford-Red-Devils-sup.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
