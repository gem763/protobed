I have a thirteen-year-old eighth-grader and an eleven-year-old fifth grader, too. They attend some great public schools. My wife and I are active participants in their lives and educations. We\u2019re proud of our kids.\n\nHaving said that, if I ever saw my kids participating in disgraceful displays like the nationwide climate change school walkout we witnessed? I\u2019d surrender as a parent. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be proud of them and I\u2019d have to wonder where I went wrong.\n\nThe young climate cultists\u2019 screaming, stomping, ranting, and in some cases tears of fear conjured in me not what these young protesters were aiming to achieve. They didn\u2019t inspire or animate me. They made me feel deep sadness and pity. Not for the atmosphere or the Earth, but for them.\n\nI don\u2019t hold my own kids up as particularly unique. Nor is my parenting. To be very clear, my kids aren\u2019t perfect and I\u2019m a flawed parent. I often ponder my behaviors and words and how they might impact the course of their history or frame of mind as they grow.\n\nConstantly I\u2019m self-auditing, hoping to set a good example but also to catch and correct the bad examples I set. Of which there have been too many to count. Despite what I do for a living both on-air and here in writing, I don\u2019t lecture my kids on my political beliefs over dinner or in the car.\n\nIf my kids learn a left-leaning concept from a relative or teacher and we overhear it or they ask us about it, my wife and I never attack the messenger. We diplomatically and respectfully walk our kids through questions to challenge the point of view they\u2019ve been fed.\n\nCritical thinking is what it\u2019s called. Not a new concept to you if you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m certain. It\u2019s not teaching people what to think, but to challenge them how to think. It\u2019s simply reasoning, deduction, and the humility to know what we don\u2019t know.\n\nMy friend, meteorologist Joe Bastardi, has become a lightning rod for daring to simply question the orthodoxy of climate change alarmists. The true believers of man made climate change viciously attack him simply because he questions. Rather than even debate the merits of the argument, Bastardi once said something that really hit home for me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to admit I could be wrong. I\u2019m willing to admit there are things we don\u2019t know. Why aren\u2019t they willing?\u201d Those are questions rooted in humility. You must possess humility to even entertain the possibility you\u2019re wrong or don\u2019t have all the answers. But humility isn\u2019t natural. It\u2019s taught. It\u2019s learned. So what\u2019s the source of humility?\n\nIt\u2019s the thing my wife and I work harder at than anything else when raising our children. It\u2019s THE thing central in our lives and we hope it will be for them throughout their lives as well.\n\nOur family\u2019s humility is found in the worship of our Lord.\n\nPlease don\u2019t read this as a suggestion there\u2019s a right way or a wrong way to be a good person or to be humble. If you\u2019re someone who finds your source of humility in other ways, that\u2019s great. If you don\u2019t believe in God or something greater than human kind, I have no beef with you.\n\nAs for our home, we always operate from the assumption He\u2019s bigger than us and is fully in control at all times. He formed us and the place we call home and while we believe in being good stewards, not polluting, etc. \u2013 we certainly are not ready to surrender our quality of life because of the false religion that our cars, hamburgers, and light bulbs make hurricanes stronger or cause fires in the Amazon.\n\nI want my kids to have a sense of something bigger and respect for things vastly out of their control. Those kids weeping and screaming about the climate need something more in their lives. They need adults to explain the majesty of nature and the billions of years of violent climate change on this planet before we ever arrived.\n\nThat we even exist in this perfect balance is nothing short of a miracle. We can no more destroy this perfect balance than we could\u2019ve created it.\n\nOur time on this planet is less than a grain of sand in an hourglass, and we are but a speck while we\u2019re here. But to the culture of political and social media mobs, the entire world seems as if it\u2019s at their fingertips and in their total control with a click of a send button.\n\nCan you imagine being a pre-teen or early teen and thinking there\u2019s no point in dreaming about your future? It\u2019s one thing if it\u2019s natural depression, which is very real struggle. But it\u2019s quite another if that depression is learned and adopted because of fatalistic, political indoctrination from adults.\n\nHyper-partisan, political adults are misleading, abusing, and scaring our children leaving them feeling hopeless and desperate. The alarming rate of suicide and depression among America\u2019s youth is skyrocketing. When you\u2019re a kid and told you have ten years to live and the adults don\u2019t care to save you, it\u2019s not hard to understand.\n\nAmerican kids shouldn\u2019t be filled with despair over secular, fake news when they should instead be filled with hope and joyful expectancy of the Good News.", "description": "I have a fourteen-year-old high school freshman at home. \u00a0I .09/27/2019 1:35:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Chris Stigall", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Reagan Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/247/3af22816-5fc6-48dc-9857-1440b2dcd639.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
