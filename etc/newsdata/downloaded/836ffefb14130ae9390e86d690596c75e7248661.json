Boeing reported a 53% drop in quarterly profit but reaffirmed the timeline for its grounded 737 MAX\u2019s return to service. Caterpillar\u2019s Asian sales tumbled, but the company said tariffs stemming from the U.S.-China trade war would have a smaller impact on its business than previously forecast.\n\nWith no new developments in trade relations, focus turned to earnings and other announcements from individual companies. Boeing and Caterpillar\u2019s shares were resilient, several analysts said, because the companies\u2019 slide in earnings was expected given the challenges they have faced throughout the year.\n\n\u201cCaterpillar has certainly been beset by trade war impact, so it wasn\u2019t necessarily all that surprising,\u201d said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. \u201cBoeing has had its own issues from the perspective of the 737 MAX.\u201d\n\nTexas Instruments shares, however, tumbled 7.5% after the chipmaker projected fourth-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates. The results sent shares of other semiconductor companies, including Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O), lower as well. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index dropped 1.9%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 45.85 points, or 0.17%, to 26,833.95, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.53 points, or 0.28%, to 3,004.52 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 15.50 points, or 0.19%, to 8,119.79.\n\nRelated Coverage Nasdaq cancels trades in about 50 securities\n\nAdvances in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) shares helped buoy the major indexes.\n\nApple shares rose 1.3% after Morgan Stanley said the iPhone maker\u2019s soon-to-be-launched video streaming service, Apple TV+, could boost its services revenue.\n\nFacebook shares advanced 2.1% after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg sought to reassure U.S. lawmakers about the company\u2019s planned digital currency, Libra.\n\nNike Inc (NKE.N) shares fell 3.4% after the sportswear company announced late on Tuesday that Mark Parker, its long-time CEO, would step down next year. Nike tapped John Donahoe, chief executive of ServiceNow Inc (NOW.N), as Parker\u2019s successor. ServiceNow shares fell 3.6%.\n\nShares of medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and laboratory equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO.N) jumped after both companies reported strong results. Boston Scientific shares ended 5.0% higher and Thermo Fisher shares closed up 5.7%.\n\nEli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) shares, however, fell 2.2% after the drugmaker missed third-quarter revenue estimates.\n\nA trader works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 22, 2019.
