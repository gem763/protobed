But what about those milder disagreements, like when that guy at the gym spews bro-science about his routine or your mother-in-law insists that her political views \u2014 and hers alone \u2014 are correct?\n\nIf you disagree with a friend, you could probably get away with a simple \u201cyou\u2019re wrong and here\u2019s why\u201d without it impacting your relationship. But with, say, strangers, a supervisor or people you\u2019re generally trying to impress, being an arsehole isn\u2019t the wisest move.\n\nOver on a recent Reddit thread, this very subject came up and users offered advice on how to fact-check someone without coming across like a total jerk. As u/riotacting suggests, your first strategy should involve asking them questions until they\u2019re faced with an error in their reasoning.\n\nAsk them to explain their argument \u2014 why they believe a certain thought to be true or where they heard this idea \u2014 and when it feels like an appropriate moment, offer your thoughts without insisting that your opinion is right. (Just don\u2019t be patronising about it; if you\u2019re not sincerely curious about their thoughts, maybe it\u2019s best to avoid this.)\n\nOur managing editor, Virginia, follows a similar strategy when dealing with disagreements. \u201cTruthfully, in social settings, I often go the passive route and say \u2018oh, I think it\u2019s xyz?\u2019 and frame it as a question,\u201d she said. \u201cOr I correct them but move it along quickly and keep it light, maybe make a self-deprecating joke about my own misunderstanding, depending on the context.\u201d Allow them the opportunity to correct themselves, or at least, find gaps in their logic that need to be filled.\n\nIf that fails, u/scienceforbid offers a simpler strategy. \u201cIf I\u2019m openly disagreeing with someone, after a minute I just go, \u2018Duh! We can Google this!\u2019\u201d they said. \u201cIt adds humour to the situation and implies either could be right.\u201d\n\nRedditors also seemed to agree that tone and word choice matter a lot when you\u2019re dealing with someone whose facts aren\u2019t right. \u201cAvoid telling people they are wrong and avoid telling them, \u2018No,\u2019\u201d u/kamikazepuffer recommends. \u201cPeople want two things: to feel heard and like they belong. Telling someone they are wrong doesn\u2019t accomplish either.\u201d\n\nWhen all else has failed, it\u2019s your decision whether you\u2019re willing to compromise your relationship; even in the face of facts, people can still take a correction personally. If it\u2019s a small disagreement or an important relationship, maybe you might give in this one time (and for your own sanity, if you\u2019re confrontation-averse).\n\nIf it happens again and again \u2014 or involves a subject that personally impacts you \u2014 however, then maybe it\u2019s time to show them the receipts. If they\u2019re absolutely unwilling to listen and you\u2019ve tried everything, sometimes, it\u2019s perfectly ok to be a jerk! Go ahead and be upfront if you\u2019re certain they\u2019re wrong \u2014 just verify your own facts, first.", "description": "As we\u2019ve written before, sometimes the best way to argue with an arsehole is to act like an arsehole.
