Says", "language": "en", "text": "The National Transportation Safety Board released the results of a monthslong review of potential lapses in the design and approval of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max on Thursday, faulting the company for making erroneous assumptions during the development of the jet and calling for broader changes in the way airplanes are certified.\n\nThe agency said Boeing had underestimated the effect that a failure of new automated software in the aircraft could have on the environment in the cockpit. When activated, the system, known as MCAS, automatically moves the Max\u2019s tail and pushes its nose down. The system contributed to two crashes in less than five months that killed 346 people and caused regulators around the world to ground the plane.\n\nResults of an internal review by Boeing, which its board made public on Wednesday, recommended changes to the design of cockpits and the company\u2019s organizational structure to improve safety.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, in a hearing on Capitol Hill, the deputy director of the Federal Aviation Administration faced questions from senators about allegations that it misled Congress about the qualifications of inspectors who helped determine the training that pilots received. A task force composed of several international regulators is expected to submit a report this month regarding how the plane was certified.", "description": "The federal agency, after a monthslong review, said the company had failed to account for how a misfire of an automated system could lead to other problems for pilots.", "authors": ["Natalie Kitroeff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/business/26boeing/26boeing-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
