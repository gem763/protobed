Bassey enters this season as one of the top pro prospects from any college that isn't in a major conference or in the preseason Top 25 .\n\n\"Guys that go to smaller schools still get drafted,\" the 6-foot-11 sophomore said. \"It's not about the school. The school doesn't get you drafted. You get yourself drafted by the way you play and stuff like that.\"\n\nAlthough he plays outside the major conferences, Bassey isn't exactly a sleeper.\n\nRated as the nation's No. 6 overall prospect in his high school class according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports, Bassey is the rare five-star prospect to sign with a mid-major program. He plays for a Western Kentucky staff that includes his legal guardian, Hennssy Auriantal, as an assistant coach.\n\nHe entered his name into the draft after his freshman season before opting to stay in school. Bassey said the pre-draft process helped him realize what he needs to make himself a better prospect.\n\nThat included improving his post moves and his shooting. Bassey also was reminded about the importance of playing hard at all times and not taking any plays off.\n\nBassey was working his way back from a knee injury early last season and played with a brace on his right knee for much of Western Kentucky's nonconference schedule.\n\nBut he still averaged 14.6 points, 10 rebounds and 2.4 blocks while helping Western Kentucky go 20-14. He was one of five finalists for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award given to the nation's top college center.\n\nHe's eager to do even more this season as he tries to help Western Kentucky earn its first NCAA Tournament bid since 2013 Western Kentucky received 13 of 14 first-place votes in a Conference USA preseason poll conducted by the league's coaches.\n\n\"This year, it's all good,\" Bassey said. \"I'm injury free. ... Everything's just different this year.\"\n\nHere's a rundown of some other players to know from non-Top 25 teams in mid-major or low-major conferences.\n\nANTOINE DAVIS, G, DETROIT MERCY\n\nHeight: 6-1\n\nClass: Sophomore\n\nNotes: Davis ranked third among all Division I players in scoring (26.1) last season and made 132 3-point baskets to break the NCAA freshman record previously owned by two-time NBA Most Valuable Player and former Davidson star Stephen Curry.
