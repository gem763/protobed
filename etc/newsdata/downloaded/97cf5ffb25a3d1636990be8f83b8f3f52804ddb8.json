The nationwide investigation led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not linked the illnesses to any specific e-cigarette product.\n\nMany of the reported illnesses involved vaping products, including cannabis products, containing vitamin E acetate, an oil derived from vitamin E that can be dangerous if inhaled. The vaping industry has blamed the surge in the contagion on black market products, but health officials have yet to rule out any vaping devices as a potential cause.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the FDA \u2014 if you don\u2019t want to die or end up in a hospital, stop vaping illegal THC oils immediately,\u201d said a spokesman from the American Vaping Association. \u201cIf you\u2019re an adult smoker or ex-smoker who vapes store-bought nicotine products, don\u2019t listen to the activists who would rather you inhale deadly smoke than vape.\u201d\n\nSymptoms among the reported cases included shortness of breath, fever, cough and vomiting. Additional indicators have included headache, dizziness and chest pain.\n\nTo date, Kansas has six cases associated with the outbreak. Health officials disclosed that the individual who died was over the age of 50 and had a history of underlying health issues, according to the statement. No other information was provided to protect patient confidentiality.\n\n\u201cOur sympathies go out to the family of the person who died,\u201d Governor Laura Kelly said in the statement. \u201cI urge Kansans to be careful. Don\u2019t put yourself in harm\u2019s way, and please follow the recommendations of public health officials.\u201d\n\nThe American Medical Association on Monday urged Americans to stop using electronic cigarettes of any sort until scientists have a better handle on the illnesses.", "description": "A Kansas resident was the sixth person to die in the United States of a mysterious respiratory illness related to vaping, state officials said on Tuesday, as public health officials scrambled to understand a nationwide health problem.", "authors": ["Matthew Lavietes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428375705&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891HP", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
