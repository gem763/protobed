The Turkish government claims the YPG is indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist group.\n\nErdogan\u2019s threatened invasion became news again this week after President Donald Trump announced that he would move 50 troops out of Rojava to other parts of Syria, a move that both the left and right establishment in Washington, DC, branded a betrayal of Kurdish allies. American troops are in Syria under the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against all wings of al-Qaeda; the Islamic State is an offshoot of al-Qaeda. American troops have no legal authority to fight any other groups or factions within Syria. Turkey is a NATO member country that the United States is treaty-bound to defend in the case of military attack.\n\nErdogan announced \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d \u2013 a violent invasion of Rojava \u2013 on Wednesday, claiming that the Syrian National Army supports the move and that Islamic State elements operate in Rojava. The Islamic State never had a significant presence in the area precisely because of the YPG\u2019s control there.\n\nThe \u201cSyrian National Army\u201d is more commonly known as the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a coalition of Sunni Arab militias that has at times included jihadist groups. It is not the official army of the government of Syria.\n\nThe Turkish Armed Forces, together with the Syrian National Army, just launched #OperationPeaceSpring against PKK/YPG and Daesh terrorists in northern Syria. Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area. \u2014 Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan (@RTErdogan) October 9, 2019\n\nThe Syrian Arab Army, the actual official army of the government of Syria, has no presence in the region where \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d is taking place, as the Kurdish forces and Assad loyalists have largely avoided overlapping on the map since the Syrian Civil War began in 2011. The YPG has toyed with the idea of allying with Assad in the event that Washington abandons them, but regularly refers to it as an undesirable last-ditch option.\n\nAssad\u2019s government issued a stern condemnation of Turkey\u2019s plan to invade the country on Wednesday through the government news agency SANA.\n\n\u201cSyria condemns in strongest terms the reckless statements and hostile intentions of the Turkish regime and the military build-up at the Syrian borders which constitute an outrageous violation of the international law and a blatant breach of the International Security Council\u2019s resolutions which affirm respecting Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d a foreign ministry \u201csource\u201d told the government outlet.\n\nThe government went on to call Erdogan an \u201cexpansionist\u201d intent on moving the borders of Turkey east.\n\nDamascus also condemned the YPG for fighting for a free Kurdistan.\n\n\u201cThe source continued that the Syrian Arab Republic holds some of the Kurdish organizations responsible for what is taking place due to their subordination to the US project,\u201d SANA reported. \u201cThey have been previously warned during the meetings with them against the dangers of that project and to not be tools serving the US policy against their homeland, but these organizations have insisted on being tools in the hands of foreigners.\u201d\n\nThe statement concluded with a threat to Turkey: Syria will \u201cconfront the Turkish aggression by all legitimate means.\u201d\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani issued a similar statement. The Assad regime is largely a proxy force of the Iranian government, tied together by Shiite Islam and alliances with the world\u2019s socialist and communist states. Rouhani used a much more measured tone than the Syrian foreign ministry.\n\n\u201cThe approach that has been adopted today (by Turkey) and the secret agreements that have been made would not benefit the region,\u201d Rouhani reportedly said, \u201cand we call on our friend and brother, Turkey, and its government, to be more careful and have more patience in such affairs and reconsider the path that has been chosen.\u201d\n\nInstead of focusing on the Kurds in northern Syria, Rouhani suggested a coalition to exterminate the last remaining rebel stronghold in the country, the city of Idlib.\n\nThough Ankara and Tehran have a tense agreement to cooperate economically, Erdogan and Assad have long referred to each other as \u201cterrorists.\u201d Erdogan has emphasized the elimination of local Kurdish populations as his reason for entering Syria more recently, but he stated in 2016:\n\nWhy did we enter? We do not have an eye on Syrian soil. The issue is to provide lands to their real owners. That is to say we are there for the establishment of justice. We entered there to end the rule of the tyrant al-Assad who terrorizes with state terror.\n\nThe Assad regime has not changed its course from assuming that Erdogan\u2019s end goal of eradicating it is still the same.\n\nThe Syrian foreign ministry has repeatedly accused Erdogan of supporting \u201cTakfiri terrorism,\u201d a term typically used to mean Sunni groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. Erdogan is openly Islamist and a Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer.\n\nThe Syrian Defense Forces (SDF), an umbrella organization primarily made up of YPG members, accused Erdogan this week of seeking ethnic cleansing in Rojava and striving to \u201ctake over new lands for ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough these attacks, Turkey seeks to take over new lands for ISIS, and prolong the life of these organizations and we do not accept in any way the attacks of Turkey and anyone supporting it,\u201d a spokesman for the SDF said.\n\nThe SDF is America\u2019s closest ally on the ground in Syria and responsible for most of the fighting against ISIS in Rojava.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Council, the civilian wing of the SDF, issued an alarmed statement Tuesday urging President Donald Trump to reconsider moving 50 troops out of Rojava to elsewhere in Syria.\n\nWe call upon Congress, the US military, and the international community to oppose this decision, and we call upon President Trump to reverse this decision,\u201d the statement read. \u201cOur brave men and women with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have just won a historic victory over the ISIS \u2018caliphate,\u2019 a victory announced by President Trump and celebrated across the world. To abandon us now would be tragic.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo disregard our partnership would also send a clear signal to all would-be partner forces of the United States that a US alliance may not be trustworthy,\u201d it concluded.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Iran and Syria issued statements Wednesday condemning Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for planning an invasion of Syrian Kurdistan.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/military-turkey-syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
