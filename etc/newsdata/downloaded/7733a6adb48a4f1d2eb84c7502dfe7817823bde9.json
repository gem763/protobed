We're ready for everything.'\n\nBut Adams - who has scored five tries already in this tournament, putting him one behind national record holder Shane Williams who scored six in 2007 - is not having that.\n\n'Everyone's got an opinion,' he smiled.\n\n'Maybe in the past we've kept games a little bit closer and kicked a little bit more ball, but that's dependent on the game-plan and how we look at the opposition.\n\nYoann Huget claimed Wales have played the same way for eight years ahead of Sunday's clash\n\n'You identify areas where you can put teams under pressure, and if that's keeping things tight with the forwards and putting more boot to ball that's what we'll do.\n\n'I definitely think in the last four games we've moved the ball quite well, and have scored some good tries, actually. It's another string to our bow.\n\n'We not only can grind teams down with the pack we've got, dominate aerially with the kicking game, we can also move the ball around and use our threats in the backs.\n\n'It's nice to keep teams guessing sometimes, whether we're going to come hard with the pack or shift it wide, but it's another string to our bow.\n\n'It's all about trying to get a complete game. You never will, but it's trying to get as close as you can to that.' The winger, 24, is fully aware how high the stakes are.\n\nWales are in a good mood and have had an edge to them in training this week, says Adams\n\n'It's slowly building,' he said of the long build-up to the knockout game in Oita.\n\n'There's been an edge to us this week, a bit of spike in training, as the forwards can vouch for.\n\n'There's been a good mood with everybody and none of us are ready to go home.'\n\nAnd, like the rest of the Wales squad gunning for glory in Japan, Adams is comfortable with the favourites tag.\n\n'You look at previous results - it's seven of the last eight for us - and you could argue we are favourites,' he said confidently.", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN OITA: His opposite number for the World Cup quarter-final on Sunday Yoann Huget suggested that Wales have played the same way since 2011 and they just rely on a defensive game.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19914272-0-image-a-34_1571519312547.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
