In Me, his newly published autobiography, John shows that his interest goes beyond the imaginary: he had many strange and fascinating interactions with members of the royal family over the years, from Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother to Princess Diana. His writing breathes humanity into a family almost always shrouded in rigid formality.\n\nJohn\u2019s relationship with the royal family began in the \u201970s, when he was invited for dinner at Kensington Palace by Princess Margaret, who was a huge fan of music and musicians. But the dinner quickly devolved into a scene of marital strife between Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, who would divorce in 1978. \u201cHe stormed in midway through the meal and literally snarled \u2018Where\u2019s my f-cking dinner?\u2019 at her,\u201d John writes. \u201cThey had a huge row, and she fled the room in tears.\u201d\n\nJohn\u2019s growing stature in British culture \u2014 combined with the fact that he lived close to Windsor Castle \u2014 made his royal interactions more and more frequent. In the late \u201970s, Prince Philip made fun of the bright yellow Aston Martin that John frequently drove around the neighborhood: \u201cMakes you look like a bloody fool. Get rid of it.\u201d The Queen Mum (Elizabeth I) came over for a meal, after which they danced to her favorite record, an old Irish drinking song called \u201cSlattery\u2019s Mounted Fut.\u201d\n\nJohn had an even more memorable encounter with the Queen Mum\u2019s daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, of whom John says, \u201cIn private, she could be hilarious.\u201d At Prince Andrew\u2019s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle, John watched her reprimand the Viscount Linley about a familial matter: \u201cThe Queen lightly slapped him across the face, saying \u2018Don\u2019t\u2019 \u2014 SLAP \u2014 \u2018argue\u2019 \u2014 SLAP \u2014 \u2018with\u2019 \u2014 SLAP \u2014 \u2018me\u2019 \u2014 SLAP \u2014 \u2018I\u2019 \u2014 SLAP \u2014 \u2018am\u2019 \u2014 SLAP \u2014 \u2018THE QUEEN!\u2019\u201d John writes that when the Queen saw him watching, she winked at him before moving on.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The pair met at the same party, and John immediately felt a kinship. \u201cShe was blessed with an incredible social ease, an ability to talk to anybody, to make herself seem ordinary,\u201d he writes. He did notice, however, that despite her disdain of royal formality, she maintained a distant and frosty relationship with her husband, Prince Charles.\n\nAs the pair spent more time together, John many times bore witness to what he termed as the \u201cDiana Effect\u201d on men. At one dinner party, he observed as Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone both became smitten by her and then nearly fought each other before getting disentangled, with Gere prevailing and Stallone storming off. \u201cI never would have come if I\u2019d known Prince f-ckin\u2019 Charming was gonna be here,\u201d John remembers Stallone grumbling. \u201cIf I\u2019d wanted her, I would\u2019ve taken her!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe could bring Hollywood superstars to the verge of a punch-up over her attentions at a dinner party, like a couple of love-struck teenager idiots,\u201d John writes.\n\nThe pair fell out after Diana dropped out of writing the foreword to a rock photography book that gave its proceeds to the AIDS Foundation. \u201cI think Buckingham Palace didn\u2019t like the idea of a member of the royal family having anything to do with a book that featured shots of naked guys with towels draped around them,\u201d John writes. They reconciled at Gianni Versace\u2019s funeral \u2014 but it was to be the last time they saw each other, as Diana died in a car crash a few weeks later.\n\nAt Diana\u2019s funeral, John sang a new version of \u201cCandle in the Wind\u201d with reworked lyrics by his writing partner Bernie Taupin. (\u201cYou called out to our country, and you whispered to those in pain,\u201d the lyrics went.) When he recorded it, the song became an international bestseller, staying at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks.\n\nBut John wasn\u2019t happy with the song\u2019s success. \u201cWhy would anyone want to listen to it?\u201d he writes. \u201cIt seemed unhealthy to me: morbid and unnatural. I really didn\u2019t think it was what Diana would have wanted.\u201d\n\nJohn\u2019s relationship with the family continues up through the present day. In April, he defended the Prince Harry and Meghan Markle after they were publicly criticized for using a private plane. \u201cI feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana\u2019s untimely death,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "In his new autobiography, Elton John opens up about his decades-long relationship with Princess Diana and the British Royal Family.", "authors": ["Andrew R.
