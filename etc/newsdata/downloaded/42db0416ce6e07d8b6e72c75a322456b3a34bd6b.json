You have to respond to that.\u201d\n\nThe righty, considered a leading contender for the AL Cy Young Award, had not taken an \u201cL\u201d since May until the World Series opener, when Scherzer and the Nationals beat him 5-4. Before that, Cole was 19-0 over his previous 25 starts.\n\nThis is a guy who led the majors in strikeouts and was second in wins during the regular season, going 20-5 with 326 Ks and a 2.50 ERA.\n\nThe way he described what happened in Game 1, when he allowed five runs in seven innings?\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have my A-game,\u201d Cole said then.\n\nScherzer, a three-time Cy Young honoree, navigated his way in and out of trouble that night in Houston, giving up two runs in five innings.\n\n\u201cAfter the first game, he already sat down and kind of mapped out his game plan for his next game,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cSo as you know: Max, he\u2019s all in. He\u2019s got a plan.\u201d\n\nOne key to getting through that outing, Scherzer said, was not giving in to the Astros\u2019 batters, and staying away from the strike zone as much as possible.\n\nThe 35-year-old right-hander was asked Saturday whether he might need to throw over the plate more this time around.\n\n\u201cThe game will dictate that. The scoreboard will dictate that. You\u2019ve got to just get into the flow of the game, and understand where everything\u2019s at, where you\u2019re at in the lineup, who\u2019s up, score of the game, inning, pitch count. You name it,\u201d he responded.\n\n\u201cThat all just goes into the same thing,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cYou just have to have your instincts out there and work with the catcher and just figure out what you want to do.\u201d\n\nHe had lost four consecutive postseason decisions coming into this year, dating to 2013 with the Detroit Tigers.\n\nAnd so far in 2019? The Nationals are 4-0 in his appearances, including three starts and one in relief. Scherzer has shown no ill effects from the upper back problem that put him on the injured list for about a month during the season.\n\nNow, he noted, he\u2019s fine.\n\n\u201cAll those back issues, I have to really address in the offseason. \u2026 How I\u2019m going to train and everything,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been dreaming up different things I might be doing this December and January to really address that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Houston's Gerrit Cole heads into his World Series rematch against the Washington Nationals and Max Scherzer in Game 5 on Sunday in an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/26/8e40ea_world-series-nationals-astros-baseball-34398-houston-astros-starting-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
