In this special feature, Times Opinion writers rank the candidates on a scale of 1 to 10: 1 means the candidate probably didn\u2019t belong on the stage and should probably drop out; 10 means it\u2019s on, President Trump. Here\u2019s what our columnists and contributors thought about the debate.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nCharles Blow (10/10) \u2014 Elizabeth Warren is now the clear front-runner, even if the polls are not there. Everyone seemed to know it. She took fire from all sides. And she responded solidly, adroitly, even brilliantly at points.\n\nJamelle Bouie (7/10) \u2014 To the extent that there\u2019s a front-runner, it\u2019s Warren, and she was the target of virtually everyone. She had moments of weakness \u2014 her answers on health care are a real vulnerability \u2014 but she withstood the heat well enough.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (8/10) \u2014 She had a weak explanation for how she would pay for Medicare for All but seemed to gain her footing when it came to taxing the wealthy. She was grounded, compelling and assertive.\n\nRoss Douthat (6/10) \u2014 Apart from her weird non-answers on Medicare and taxes, in her first front-runner debate, she was fine. But hardly untouchable, and not quite as great as her press coverage.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (6/10) \u2014 I\u2019m irritated by the demands that Warren give the right a talking point by saying she\u2019ll raise middle-class taxes to pay for Medicare for All. But her inability to finesse those demands scares me to death.\n\nNick Kristof (8/10) \u2014 Strong on wealth tax, evasive on Medicare financing, inevitably took hits as others ganged up on her as the new front-runner.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (8/10) \u2014 Bruised but unbeaten. Her health care plan attracted skepticism over how she intends to pay for it, but she kept her cool and knows what she wants to accomplish. She\u2019s a candidate working-class America might go for, and she sounds like a Democrat.\n\nMelanye Price (8/10) \u2014 She is unsinkable. They were all attacking her. She stood up to them without breaking a sweat.\n\nMimi Swartz (8/10) \u2014 She held her own again, didn\u2019t get flustered and didn\u2019t need to get lost in convoluted dodges. \u201cThank you, President Obama\u201d did the job.\n\nTanzina Vega (6/10) \u2014 She came across as an academic mired in her usual talking points.\n\nPete Wehner (4/10) \u2014 In an era when politicians are despised she\u2019s showing us that she\u2019s a quintessential politician: evasive, canned, rehearsed. She feigned shock at the charge that she\u2019s \u201cpunitive\u201d toward billionaires and corporations. I\u2019m not sure why.\n\nWill Wilkinson (8/10) \u2014 Her stoutly poised defense against relentless attacks solidified the perception that the race is now Warren\u2019s to lose. Refusing to say she\u2019d raise taxes to pay for M4A hurt her in the debate but will help her in the race.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nCharles Blow (6/10) \u2014 Sanders is the dean of the stage. His legacy is secure. But it feels that his moment has passed. At times he felt like the Cal Naughton to Warren\u2019s Ricky Bobby from \u201cTalladega Nights\u201d: His answers served only to help Warren. Slingshot!\n\nJamelle Bouie (9/10) \u2014 For a guy who just had a heart attack, Bernie was feisty, energetic and occasionally very funny. Not just the best performance of the night but probably his best debate performance thus far.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (9/10) \u2014 He was the toughest and most genuine candidate. His frustration with the state of health care, climate change and wealth inequality reflected the frustration of average Americans who are desperate for radical change.\n\nRoss Douthat (7/10) \u2014 Seemed fit, vigorous, very much himself: More \u201cwith it\u201d than Biden, more straightforward than Warren. And the AOC endorsement as the capper!\n\nMichelle Goldberg (8/10) \u2014 It\u2019s nice to see that after his heart attack he\u2019s exactly the same as ever.\n\nNick Kristof (6/10) \u2014 Admirable passion and authenticity. But didn\u2019t resolve doubts about his age or stem the progressive drift to Warren.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (7/10) \u2014 He has the same passion, same energy, same disregard for policy details as before the heart attack. And he was right to highlight his cooperation with Senator Mike Lee against the Saudi war in Yemen.\n\nMelanye Price (6/10) \u2014 He needed to show Democratic voters that he was healthy enough to stay in the race. He did that by answering questions about his health head-on.\n\nMimi Swartz (7/10) \u2014 Less crazy angry uncle and more kind angry uncle this time around. Sharper than Big Joe throughout.\n\nTanzina Vega (7/10) \u2014 He appeared lower on energy \u2014 though not on policy \u2014 than usual.\n\nPete Wehner (6/10) \u2014 This debate is the first time I think I\u2019ve seen him smile. He also actually struck a grace note, and it happened in response to a question about his heart attack. The rest of the time he was the old Bernie.\n\nWill Wilkinson (8/10) \u2014 Sanders did not seem a bit infarcted, made the case for tax hikes Warren studiously evaded, and drew blood in his dissenting account of Biden\u2019s record of \u201cgetting things done.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nCharles Blow (6/10) \u2014 Buttigieg came raring for a fight. Sometimes he was smart and informed \u2014 in his exchange with Warren on health care. But at other times he came across as condescending \u2014 in his gun control exchange with O\u2019Rourke. Buttigieg was the diet soda of the stage: a smart, responsible choice with an unpleasant aftertaste.\n\nJamelle Bouie (6/10) \u2014 If Buttigieg wasn\u2019t as good as he was during the foreign policy segment this would be two points lower only because he lets people call him \u201cMayor Pete\u201d onstage.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (5/10) \u2014 He did himself a huge disservice by trying to portray himself as potential commander in chief \u2014 he came across as cold, rehearsed and unnecessarily argumentative.\n\nRoss Douthat (7/10) \u2014 Much improved, picked an effective fight with Warren early, helped his (shaky) case to be included in the Top 4.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (8/10) \u2014 Not sure why he got into a heated exchange with Beto. But he dominated on foreign policy, and he\u2019s right about expanding the Supreme Court.\n\nNick Kristof (8/10) \u2014 Dazzling at his best, uneven in other answers. Made an effective case to moderates.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (7/10) \u2014 Bizarre plan to pack the Supreme Court notwithstanding, he was the strongest Republican onstage. Not my kind of Republican, but the kind that Democrats might do well to welcome.\n\nMelanye Price (3/10) \u2014 He\u2019s not the Democratic wunderkind anymore.\n\nMimi Swartz (6/10) \u2014 He had to look like a grownup and did, for the most part. Smacked down Beto, sir, yes sir!\n\nTanzina Vega (8/10) \u2014 Mayor Pete was on fire tonight.\n\nPete Wehner (10/10) \u2014 He was terrific, from taking on Warren for her evasiveness to hammering O\u2019Rourke, from his impassioned defense of American honor to his insistence that Democrats think beyond Trump. If Democrats were smart, they\u2019d recognize the potential of his appeal. They probably won\u2019t.\n\nWill Wilkinson (8/10) \u2014 He went to the mat for moderation, waging precision attacks on pie-in-the-sky radicalism to his left. Gambling that \u201cgood enough\u201d is good enough for Democratic voters isn\u2019t a bad bet.\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nCharles Blow (4/10) \u2014 Still standing in the middle of the road watching the cars whiz by.\n\nJamelle Bouie (5/10) \u2014 She loves jokes and thinks your plans aren\u2019t going to work. A candidate for conservative Democrats and NeverTrump Republicans and no one else.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (4/10) \u2014 She tried to paint herself as the perfect moderate but only appeared to want the world the way it is.\n\nRoss Douthat (7/10) \u2014 Probably her best night, albeit still with some cringe one-liners. If there\u2019s an opening for a credible non-Biden moderate, she helped herself. If.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (8/10) \u2014 This was her best debate, especially on opioids, anti-trust and abortion rights.\n\nNick Kristof (9/10) \u2014 Her best debate so far. Feisty and effectively presented herself as a moderate alternative to Biden.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (5/10) \u2014 She\u2019s running to be Biden\u2019s VP and made a good case for herself as a Democrat who can win red districts. She has more confidence and projects more competence than the other also-rans.\n\nMelanye Price (1/10) \u2014 She is working so hard to win Republicans and Independents that she is losing Democrats.\n\nMimi Swartz (7/10) \u2014 Much livelier, much feistier. But wow, that death ray stare!\n\nTanzina Vega (6/10) \u2014 She came out swinging, but she lacks that wow factor.\n\nPete Wehner (8/10) \u2014 She had her best debate by far. She took aim at Warren and hit the mark; at the close she spoke movingly about Senator McCain.\n\nWill Wilkinson (7/10) \u2014 Klobuchar put in her strongest, liveliest performance to move up in the moderate lane. She gets a bit quavery when she\u2019s passionate, though.\n\nCory Booker\n\nCharles Blow (5/10) \u2014 I like Booker\u2019s high-mindedness, but his head gets so far up in the clouds that he forgets that the fight is on the ground.\n\nJamelle Bouie (5/10) \u2014 Constantly admonishing the debaters about debating each other gets old very quick.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (5/10) \u2014 He spent more time trying to make the stage a \u201csafe space\u201d than articulating a vision for America. If he believes that a politics of passivity and \u201clet\u2019s just all get along\u201d one-liners will keep him in the race, he is wrong.\n\nRoss Douthat (6/10) \u2014 Solid as ever, still in search of a clear justification for why voters should choose him.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (9/10) \u2014 He always excels at these things and it never seems to matter.\n\nNick Kristof (9/10) \u2014 Eloquent and unifying, and gets credit for raising child poverty. He lifted the debate.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (3/10) \u2014 An echo, not a choice: outspoken on abortion, but no more so than others. He spent an inordinate amount of time lamenting the party\u2019s in-fighting, i.e., its real debate. Is he running for school counselor?\n\nMelanye Price (5/10) \u2014 Sometimes he seems more like a referee than a primary candidate.\n\nMimi Swartz (6/10) \u2014 Mr. Inspirational. Mr. Hopeful. Mr. Conciliatory. But how does he get to the next level? The Office of Reproductive Freedom?\n\nTanzina Vega (5/10) \u2014 He was both the peacemaker and the vegan.\n\nPete Wehner (4/10) \u2014 Robert Bork is \u201claughing in his sleep\u201d? What an awkward, unfortunate line. An office for reproductive freedom? Uh, no. He also sounded pained that Democrats are criticizing Democrats in a presidential primary, which they do every four years.\n\nWill Wilkinson (6/10) \u2014 Booker ably performed the role of very concerned debate guidance counselor.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nCharles Blow (5/10) \u2014 Something just isn\u2019t jelling. Harris always has a couple of zingers in her quiver, but they just didn\u2019t do it for me on this debate stage.\n\nJamelle Bouie (6/10) \u2014 At her best, Harris is as sharp as a Hattori Hanzo blade. And there were moments where she cut through questions with ease. But her exchange about Twitter with Warren was inexplicable and a real low point.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (5/10) \u2014 She thinks people of color are going to embrace her business-as-usual politics, vote against their own collective interests and forget her shameful prosecutorial record as long as she invokes Maya Angelou. She is misinformed.\n\nRoss Douthat (4/10) \u2014 Her attempt to shame Warren over the question of whether Twitter should suspend Trump was just another weird choice in her candidacy\u2019s weird decline.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (5/10) \u2014 She didn\u2019t get nearly enough time, which made her decision to dwell on Trump\u2019s Twitter account all the more baffling.\n\nNick Kristof (5/10) \u2014 Some great answers but lost me by picking a fight over Trump tweets.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (4/10) \u2014 When she spontaneously spoke out for abortion rights, she set herself apart with her passion and commitment. But mostly she sounds annoyed and affected. Discipline is her strength \u2014 she commands her facts and figures \u2014 but empathy is her weakness.\n\nMelanye Price (4/10) \u2014 She is performing a version of powerful leadership that I don\u2019t really buy.\n\nMimi Swartz (7/10) \u2014 Even with sanded edges, she managed to hang tough. But like so many others, she needs a breakout issue.\n\nTanzina Vega (7/10) \u2014 Her use of the \u201cshe/her\u201d pronoun when referring to the future president was suave.\n\nPete Wehner (4/10) \u2014 Good grief: She spoke as if kicking Trump off Twitter is now a national priority and the most important issue of her campaign. Her campaign continues to lose altitude \u2014 fast.\n\nWill Wilkinson (6/10) \u2014 Harris showed flashes of strength, but her intensity can collapse into a casualness both charming and weird. Her attack on Trump\u2019s Twitter account was odd.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nCharles Blow (7/10) \u2014 Bless his heart. It feels like he\u2019s just hanging on for dear life. At moments, it felt like he vanished, not just because it wasn\u2019t his time to speak but because his aura of invincibility is flickering like a candle in a hurricane. But he yelled in his closing, so there\u2019s that.\n\nJamelle Bouie (3/10) \u2014 At the halfway point I had Biden at about a 5 or 6 but then he tried to claim credit for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and yelled at Warren about it. It was one of the most unbecoming moments of the primary thus far.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (3/10) \u2014 Biden\u2019s unintelligibility proved that he remains a logical choice only for Americans who prefer a figurehead statesman to a truly effective leader. America is moving on.\n\nRoss Douthat (5/10) \u2014 Without the front-runner\u2019s halo, he seemed to fade until a closing scrap with Sanders and Warren. Expect his poll numbers to be stable again.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (6/10) \u2014 Seeing him struggling to express himself is deeply anxiety-provoking, like watching someone walk a tightrope drunk. What does \u201cclipping coupons in the stock market\u201d mean?\n\nNick Kristof (5/10) \u2014 Strong on foreign policy and always seems decent and honorable \u2014 but also rambling and unfocused. Didn\u2019t fend off Senator Warren.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (6/10) \u2014 He doesn\u2019t drive the debate, doesn\u2019t stand out for his ideas, struggles with words and struggles to explain his son\u2019s foreign income. And \u201cthe most shameful thing\u201d in recent foreign policy history would actually be the Iraq war that Biden voted for.\n\nMelanye Price (3/10) \u2014 He casts himself as an old-school prize fighter, but he comes off as just old-school.\n\nMimi Swartz (7/10) \u2014 He stayed in the game until the fourth quarter for the first time, with no record player references. Fielded Hunter questions well enough, but his last stab at Warren translated onscreen as \u201cListen here, little lady.\u201d\n\nTanzina Vega (6/10) \u2014 His frustration with the current president was palpable. It\u2019s the Joe Biden that older centrist Democrats like.\n\nPete Wehner (5/10) \u2014 He once again showed that he starts O.K. and gets worse \u2014 more confused and louder. Also, the fact of the matter is that \u201cthe fact of the matter\u201d is a phrase that shouldn\u2019t be used more than a dozen times in a debate.\n\nWill Wilkinson (5/10) \u2014 He was peppy but often tongue-tied. His petulance in the late exchange with Warren drew an unfavorable contrast with her stinging restraint.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\n\nCharles Blow (4/10) \u2014 He seemed chastened by the blowback from going after Biden in the last debate. But his non-confrontational style came across as cowed. He reverted to the \u201ccordial candidate\u201d I dubbed him when I interviewed him in December.\n\nJamelle Bouie (7/10) \u2014 Castro\u2019s answer on gun violence and police violence was one of the most sophisticated things I\u2019ve heard from a candidate. He\u2019s been a solid, impressive debater, but too bad he isn\u2019t doing better in the polls.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (4/10) \u2014 Castro was competent, clear and thoroughly uncompelling.\n\nRoss Douthat (3/10) \u2014 The most unmemorable performance on the stage.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (7/10) \u2014 \u201cPolice violence is also gun violence\u201d was one of the more memorable lines of the night.\n\nNick Kristof (5/10) \u2014 Always smart, but less relevant in this debate.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (2/10) \u2014 He\u2019s charisma-deficient and made no mark on the debate. Yet he sets a benchmark for \u201cgarden-variety politician\u201d that two others failed to meet.\n\nMelanye Price (5/10) \u2014 His comment that \u201cpolice violence is also gun violence\u201d will resonate with many black and Latinx voters.\n\nMimi Swartz (7/10) \u2014 More thoughtful, more serious, less snippy, but still needs an issue to separate him from the pack.\n\nTanzina Vega (7/10) \u2014 He was the only candidate to mention Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman who was shot and killed in her home last weekend by a white police officer.\n\nPete Wehner (3/10) \u2014 It was his worst debate. He was flat and forgettable. Enough said.\n\nWill Wilkinson (5/10) \u2014 A solid performance with a handful of strong responses, but he failed to make a mark.\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nCharles Blow (3/10) \u2014 I like to hear Yang explain his proposals, but in repeated tellings they feel more and more narrow. Like the \u201cMATH\u201d lapel pin.\n\nJamelle Bouie (7/10) \u2014 I personally think Yang is a shallow candidate whose only saving grace is his ability to stay on message. But he\u2019s able to do that very well, and that\u2019s not nothing.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (5/10) \u2014 He presented himself as a pragmatic and highly competent businessman, but America is not a start-up.\n\nRoss Douthat (5/10) \u2014 I just fundamentally like him, but he\u2019s probably wrong about the automation problem and since that\u2019s his core pitch I can\u2019t help getting frustrated.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (4/10) \u2014 The Democratic National Committee really needs to tighten the qualifying rules for these debates.\n\nNick Kristof (6/10) \u2014 Leadership on economic malaise and on drug policy, but not obviously ready for the White House.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (5/10) \u2014 Remember the 999 plan? Andrew Yang is this year\u2019s Herman Cain, a somewhat likeable technocrat with one big, not-very-good idea. The rest of what he says is an Economist editorial.\n\nMelanye Price (1/10) \u2014 He is very smart and asks interesting questions that would be fun to debate at a social gathering, but they\u2019re not the kind of questions that make me want to vote for him.\n\nMimi Swartz (3/10) \u2014 Here\u2019s the deal. I will have you to dinner and let you talk as long as you want if you will withdraw.\n\nTanzina Vega (5/10) \u2014 This one note candidate won\u2019t cut through the congressional gridlock.\n\nPete Wehner (6/10) \u2014 He showed he\u2019s got one of the most interesting, creative and idiosyncratic minds on the debate stage. Not only does he believe that we are in the Fourth Industrial Revolution; he is not going to let you forget it.\n\nWill Wilkinson (6/10) \u2014 Yang\u2019s Freedom Dividend spiel has made U.B.I. an issue candidates must take a position on. He was a source of good sense on wealth taxes, but unnecessarily alienated faithful Bing users.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\n\nCharles Blow (5/10) \u2014 I still love O\u2019Rourke on gun control, but he has to grow his national appeal.\n\nJamelle Bouie (4/10) \u2014 Very strange for Beto to go after his rivals for \u201cdividing America\u201d while simultaneously calling for gun confiscation and an end to tax exempt status for churches who disagree with his politics.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (6/10) \u2014 He proved he would be the perfect successor to Obama in the bygone era of the beloved Everyman politician who is concerned, but it is just that \u2014 bygone.\n\nRoss Douthat (2/10) \u2014 To me, as unbearable as ever. Your response may be more positive, but then you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (4/10) \u2014 Seriously? You\u2019re going to call Elizabeth Warren \u201cpunitive\u201d?\n\nNick Kristof (5/10) \u2014 Eloquently reminded us that he\u2019s an excellent candidate \u2014 for the Senate.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (1/10) \u2014 Only his call for confiscating AR-15 and AK-47 rifles stands out. But he couldn\u2019t say how he would even identify the gun owners, let alone how he would forcibly take their guns.\n\nMelanye Price (3/10) \u2014 He lost important ground in the last debate because of his support for mandatory gun seizures. He couldn\u2019t get any of it back.\n\nMimi Swartz (5/10) \u2014 It\u2019s been a long road back, and he\u2019s halfway there. But Elizabeth Warren? Punitive?\n\nTanzina Vega (5/10) \u2014 His place is really in Congress, not on the world stage.\n\nPete Wehner (4/10) \u2014 He preached unifying the country and reaching out to people who don\u2019t agree with you within a week after he said that as president he\u2019d target charities, churches and religious organizations for holding views different than his on same-sex marriage. One suggestion: Don\u2019t use Spanish when you\u2019re answering a question about Russia.\n\nWill Wilkinson (6/10) \u2014 The Gen X conscience of the nation bested Mayor Pete in an earnestness showdown over gun control, but he doesn\u2019t know how to close the sale.\n\nTulsi Gabbard\n\nCharles Blow (2/10) \u2014 Hard pass. No ma\u2019am \u2026\n\nJamelle Bouie (2/10) \u2014 The best way to show the world you aren\u2019t an apologist for Assad is not to robotically repeat the same pro-Assad phrase for five minutes.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (2/10) \u2014 It seems she should fully embrace her isolationist tendencies and distaste for mainstream media and run on the Republican ticket.\n\nRoss Douthat (4/10) \u2014 Sought, and conspicuously didn\u2019t find, a defining conflict with Warren to match her earlier blow to Harris. Her pronunciation of \u201cMayor Pete\u201d was her best moment.\n\nMichelle Goldberg (2/10) \u2014 You don\u2019t prove you\u2019re not an Assad apologist by robotically repeating his talking points. Why couldn\u2019t she have boycotted?\n\nNick Kristof (2/10) \u2014 Not a player tonight and weak on Syria, but glad she (and Sanders) mentioned Yemen.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (6/10) \u2014 You\u2019d hardly think she was in the debate, but she got to repeat the phrase \u201cregime-change wars.\u201d She didn\u2019t flinch from the implications of what opposing such wars means in Syria and confronts Democrats with an acid test of their antiwar bona fides, and most of them fail.\n\nMelanye Price (1/10) \u2014 It\u2019s hard to understand how she continues to meet the requirements to get on the debate stage.\n\nMimi Swartz (2/10) \u2014 Cool under fire, even when she sounded like a lunatic. But who brags about a friendship with Trey Gowdy?\n\nTanzina Vega (2/10) \u2014 She threatened to boycott the debate. She should have stayed home.\n\nPete Wehner (2/10) \u2014 She employed an odd debate strategy, which is to list all the negative things that others have said about her and then answer in an aggrieved tone. She also picked a weird moment to come to the defense of the Assad regime.\n\nWill Wilkinson (4/10) \u2014 Gabbard shored up her status as Trump voters\u2019 favorite Democrat.\n\nTom Steyer\n\nCharles Blow (2/10) \u2014 I have appreciated Steyer\u2019s drive against Donald Trump from the beginning, but why on earth is he running for president? As Keke Palmer would say, \u201csorry to this man.\u201d\n\nJamelle Bouie (1/10) \u2014 Very clear why Steyer had to buy his way onto this stage.\n\nBianca Vivion Brooks (1/10) \u2014 I tried, but the idea that a hedge fund investor who effectively bought his way into this debate could have any legitimate commentary on issues like wealth inequality was laughable.\n\nRoss Douthat (1/10) \u2014 Was it worth it, Tom? How much did you spend for this magic moment?\n\nMichelle Goldberg (4/10) \u2014 His campaign is an idiotic waste of money that he could spend on actually helping to defeat Trump. At least he brought up climate change, an issue at least as important as Ellen\u2019s friendship with George W. Bush.\n\nNick Kristof (5/10) \u2014 Much of what he said was smart, but just wasn\u2019t really a player.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (1/10) \u2014 Far from making a case for capitalism, he showcases the billionaire as conformist mediocrity.\n\nMelanye Price (1/10) \u2014 It\u2019s unfair to voters watching these overly-long debates to have a new player this late in the game.\n\nMimi Swartz (4/10) \u2014 O.K. but no.\n\nTanzina Vega (3/10) \u2014 Who? The lone billionaire on the stage that wants to be fair to workers and take on corporations. Pass.\n\nPete Wehner (2/10) \u2014 Donald Trump has already shown us that being a billionaire doesn\u2019t qualify a person to be president.
