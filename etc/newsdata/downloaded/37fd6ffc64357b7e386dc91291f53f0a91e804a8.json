Rather, we will just move on to a new phase.\n\n\u201cIf there is no deal, it will cause severe disruption for British and Irish people alike - not so much on the continent.\u201d\n\nAnd he told Mr Johnson: \u201cWhatever happens, we will have to get back to the negotiating table quite quickly and when we do the first items on the agenda will be citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border - all issues which we had resolved in the withdrawal agreement reached by your predecessor.\u201d\n\nMr Varadkar said a deal was \u201cpossible\u201d but added that this would lead to \u201cvery tough\u201d negotiations on issues like tariffs, fishing rights and state aid, which would then have to be ratified by 31 parties to any future trade agreement (FTA).\n\n\u201cNegotiating FTAs with the EU and the US and securing their ratification in less than three years is going to be a Herculean task for you, but we do want to be your friend and ally in doing so, and I think the manner in which you leave the European Union will determine if that is possible.\u201d\n\nDismissing any prospect of Ireland giving up the backstop without legally-binding assurances to replace it, he told Mr Johnson: \u201cWhat we cannot do and will not do is agree to the replacement of a legal guarantee with a promise.\u201d", "description": "Britain has so far put forward no alternative proposals for the Irish border which would permit Dublin to give up the backstop, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said, in comments pouring cold water on Boris Johnson\u2019s claims that progress is being made towards a Brexit deal.
