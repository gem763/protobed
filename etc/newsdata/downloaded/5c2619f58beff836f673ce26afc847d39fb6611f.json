The government instead encouraged debtors to turn to the courts for relief.\n\nAround half a million Poles have franc mortgages, totaling about \u20ac25 billion. Before the 2008 economic crisis, low Swiss interest rates made such loans cheaper than taking loans denominated in z\u0142oty. However, the crisis saw investors flee to the safety of the franc \u2014 pushing up its value against the z\u0142oty and other currencies. A final blow landed in 2015, when the Swiss National Bank abandoned its peg against the euro and let the franc soar.\n\n\u201cThe bank adviser explained that Swiss francs are a stable currency, and that because we had joined the EU, soon we\u2019ll be adopting the euro, which would make it all the more beneficial.\u201d \u2014 Dorota P\u0119kalska, real estate agent in Warsaw\n\nBecause the vast majority of Polish borrowers \u2014 called frankowicze \u2014 earn in z\u0142oty not francs, a rise in the value of the Swiss currency has left them struggling to repay bloated loans.\n\n\u201cIt was deceptive. Banks unilaterally set the exchange rate for these loans, and raised them on the eve of repayment,\u201d said Leszek Paw\u0142owicz, vice president of the Gdansk Institute for Market Economics.\n\nSome 8,000 lawsuits have since been lodged in Polish courts, mostly disputing how banks set rates and how they alerted customers to risks. Some law firms are specializing in such cases, advertising through Facebook pages such as \u201cde-franc your loan\u201d or \u201clife without the loan.\u201d\n\nLocal court rulings have been inconsistent, with some favoring banks, and others borrowers.\n\n\u2018A stable currency\u2019\n\nDorota P\u0119kalska, a real estate agent in Warsaw, is one of those claimants. She told POLITICO that lenders considered her more creditworthy if she borrowed in francs than in z\u0142oty, and most of her clients were doing the same.\n\n\u201cThe bank adviser explained that Swiss francs are a stable currency, and that because we had joined the EU, soon we\u2019ll be adopting the euro, which would make it all the more beneficial,\u201d she said.\n\nP\u0119kalska said her mortgage was worth 420,000 z\u0142oty in 2007. That year, a franc cost about 2.20 z\u0142oty. By 2012 (when most banks stopped offering such products) it was about 3.30 z\u0142oty, and now it's 4.02 z\u0142oty per franc \u2014 which means the amount of money she owes the bank has risen much faster than her repayments.\n\n\u201cI simply assumed that there must have been a mistake \u2014 that it was not simply a loan, that I had been cheated,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the case now before European judges, a Warsaw district court asked for a ruling on a legal technicality: If part of a contract is flawed and the questionable clause is removed, how should the remainder of the agreement be treated?\n\nOn May 14, a Court of Justice advocate general gave an advisory opinion that if a Polish court finds an abusive clause in a mortgage contract, it can either void the contract or else keep the agreement (minus the doubtful clause) in force if that favors the client. The CJEU tends to, but doesn't have to, follow the advocate general's opinion.\n\nThe opinion set off a storm. With the franc-indexation clause gone, a loan would be converted to z\u0142oty at the original rate, but interest would still be calculated using Swiss rates \u2014 minus 0.75 percent at the country's current benchmark, while Poland's is 1.5 percent.\n\n\u2018Dangerous\u2019 precedent\n\nDespite his caution about the fairness of the loans, Paw\u0142owicz warned that if the CJEU follows the advocate general's opinion, it could violate the EU\u2019s law on financial benchmark indexes. In a letter to the European court, he warned that judges should consider the wider implication of such a verdict.\n\n\u201cIt will create a precedent that will be dangerous in economic terms as it might threaten the stability of the financial system and lead to a banking crisis in Poland,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDuring the 2015 electoral campaign, PiS promised that debtors would be able to favorably convert their debts into z\u0142otys.\n\nPaw\u0142owicz also warned that a CJEU ruling favoring the frankowicze would be unfair. \u201cWe create a situation in which people who chose to take out a [more expensive] Polish z\u0142oty loan to avoid exchange rate risk \u2014 the responsible ones \u2014 end up fooled when those who took riskier loans are given a bonus,\u201d he said.\n\nThe potential impact has spooked lenders. The Polish Banking Association estimates that if the court ruling creates a precedent allowing all borrowers to seek conversions, the sector could take a 60 billion z\u0142oty hit, forcing banks to raise additional capital.\n\n\u201cIt will definitely set off an urgent search for investors, which is not easy in a sector which has had low profitability for a number of years,\u201d said Krzysztof Pietraszkiewicz, president of the banking lobby.\n\nSome banks are more exposed than others. The largest Swiss-franc lenders as a share of their loan portfolios were Bank Millennium (26.2 percent), Getin Noble Bank (23 percent) and mBank (16.9 percent).\n\nThe Warsaw Stock Exchange\u2019s banking index has already dropped by almost 10 percent in the past month in anticipation of the ruling, with the most-exposed banks losing a fifth of their market value.\n\nTheir situation contrasts with lenders in Hungary, which at one time faced an even bigger Swiss franc problem. Franc-denominated loans once amounted to 70 percent of the country\u2019s household debt, compared with 38 percent in Poland.\n\nThe Hungarian government came to a compromise in 2014 \u2014 shortly before the Swiss currency soared \u2014 by forcing banks to convert \u20ac9 billion of loans into forints, with Hungary\u2019s central bank providing liquidity to help banks manage their risk.\n\nNo government action\n\nPoland ruled out a Hungarian-style conversion plan. But the delay in tackling the issue has opened the risk of an unfavourable ECJ ruling that could cost more than Hungary's solution.\n\nThe ruling also has political ramifications if it arrives ahead of the October 13 election.\n\nPiS dodged the issue \u2014 both due to the expense, and because most borrowers are from the urban middle classes, who aren't the party's natural electorate.\n\nDuring the 2015 electoral campaign, PiS promised that debtors would be able to favorably convert their debts into z\u0142otys. However, a number of radical proposals alarmed foreign investors and failed to clear the bar with parliament.\n\nIn 2017, party leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski suggested instead that loan holders \u201cshould take matters into their own hands and fight in courts\u201d because \u201cthe government cannot take steps which would shake the banking system.\u201d\n\nBut now that approach risks shaking the banking system \u2014 creating a potent election issue and potentially storing up long-term problems for the economy if banks are forced to rein in lending to build up their capital positions.", "description": "Upcoming EU court ruling may jolt Poland over loans given in Swiss francs.", "authors": ["Maria Wilczek", "Zosia Wanat"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1065837234-1200x628.jpg"}
