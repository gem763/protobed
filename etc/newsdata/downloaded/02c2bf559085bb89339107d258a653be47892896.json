This result is not surprising since, at any given point, about half of private sector workers do not have an employer-sponsored retirement plan, and many who do have a plan end up saving relatively little.\n\nThe question addressed in a new study is how much increased saving could reduce the percentage of households at risk.\n\nRead: Would you take a money-back guarantee from your 401(k)?\n\nThe NRRI is based on data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances and is constructed in three steps: 1) projecting a replacement rate \u2014 retirement income as a share of preretirement income \u2014 for each household; 2) constructing a target replacement rate that would allow each household to maintain its preretirement standard of living in retirement; and 3) comparing the projected and target replacement rates to find the percentage of households at risk.\n\nRead: This is the one thing workers over 65 really want from their job\n\nThe new analysis first increased saving by various percentages for those with access to a 401(k) plan; the results show that a 5-percentage point increase in saving reduced the NRRI from 50% to 47% (see figure below). Assuming the availability of a retirement savings plan for those currently with no such plan at work, a 5-percentage-point increase in contributions lowers the NRRI further to 44%.\n\nThe impact on the NRRI of increased saving might seem surprisingly small given that 5 percentage points represents more than a 50% increase in the average contribution rate. To help make sense of this outcome, it is useful to consider three factors:\n\n\u2022 Increased saving has a much larger impact on younger households (11 percentage points for households ages 30-39) than older households (3 percentage points for those 50-59), because younger workers have many years to accumulate additional assets.\n\n\u2022 Additional saving has a much larger impact on the \u201csavings gap\u201d \u2014 the amount by which NRRI households fall short of their savings goal \u2014 than on the NRRI itself. Before the additional saving, the dollar shortfall for all \u201cat risk\u201d households combined was $7.1 trillion; increasing saving by 5 percentage points reduces the gap to $5.4 trillion. This one-quarter reduction in the aggregate dollar gap far exceeds the one-eighth drop in the NRRI.\n\n\u2022 Third, it is hard to move the NRRI. For example, even the Great Recession resulted in only a 9-percentage-point-increase in the index.\n\nThe only way to dramatically reduce the percentage of households at risk is to increase the assumed retirement age. Specifically, increasing the retirement age in the NRRI from 65 (the current assumption) to 67 (Social Security\u2019s eventual full retirement age (FRA)) cuts the percentage of households at risk by about a third (see figure below).\n\nThe key to this impact is the structure of Social Security benefits. Monthly benefits increase by 7% to 8% a year between 62 and 70, due to the actuarial reduction before the FRA and the delayed retirement credit between the FRA and age 70. Combining the increase in the retirement age with a 5-percentage-point increase in the contribution rate results in a dramatic decline in the NRRI for all ages.", "description": "Saving more helps a little, but has big impact when combined with working longer.", "authors": ["Alicia H.
