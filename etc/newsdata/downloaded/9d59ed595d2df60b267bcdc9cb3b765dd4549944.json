ALH and Endeavour also have separate property development teams.\n\nAreas of efficiency\n\n\"So there are some obvious areas of efficiency we think we can go after,\" Mr Marr said.\n\nWoolworths is identifying potential cost savings, which will not be quantified in documents for the first shareholder vote in December but may be addressed in documentation for the demerger vote next calendar year.\n\nMr Marr said one-off demerger costs of $275 million reflected the complexity of separating drinks and supermarkets and establishing a new entity with its own management team and support functions, board of directors and an independent chairman (a sub-committee of Woolworths' board is currently assessing suitable candidates).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This business is incredibly integrated, it was developed inside Woolworths,\" Mr Marr said. \"By contrast, Wesfarmers bought Coles and ran it relatively separately then demerged it.\"\n\nMr Marr pulled together a team of about 50 people from Woolworths' strategy, legal, finance and human resources functions to work on the project. There are three streams of work covering the legal, financial and technical aspects of the restructure, (including reviewing 3000 property leases and hundreds of contracts), operational separation and partnership agreements, and internal communications.\n\nMaintain connections\n\nA key consideration has been maintaining the connections between Endeavour and Woolworths through about 20 partnership agreements covering areas such as supply chain and distribution, marketing, access to Woolworths' payments switch and rewards program. These agreements have helped the businesses leverage the group's scale.\n\nFor example, about 500 BWS liquor stores are attached to a supermarket and share back dock facilities, while Woolworths.com.au sells liquor supplied by BWS.\n\n\"They're really trying to formalise what is in place already,\" Mr Marr said. \u201cWe're well progressed against what I think is a very ambitious timetable.\"\n\nThe team is also looking at the appropriate capital structure for Endeavour and Woolworths, taking into account future capital spending requirements, credit metrics and dividend policies.\n\nMr Marr said there would be no independent expert's report for the first shareholder vote in December but Woolworths would appoint an independent expert to assess the fairness and reasonableness of the subsequent demerger next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth resolutions will need approval from 50 per cent of shareholders and 75 per cent of votes cast.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a great outcome for both businesses ultimately,\" Mr Marr said.\n\n\u201cWith food it gives tremendous simplicity to its model, focusing on food and everyday needs, and with Endeavour it provides a pure focus on drinks and hospitality and direct access to capital, which is important to help deliver its growth potential,\" he said.\n\n\u201cMost shareholders understand the logic of the benefits of simplicity and they like this idea of two business focused on their core. They've generally been very supportive so far.\"", "description": "Woolworths believes the demerger of food and drinks will create value for shareholders but it will create extra costs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3657%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_698%2C$y_93/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c19b6799b768570f1b544ea7c31ee6d7b9a7f384", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
