In India, we are going from very high rates of market growth to growth rates in the mid-single digits of growth,\u201d Unilever finance chief Graeme Pitkethly told Reuters.\n\nIn China, sales growth within bricks-and-mortar retailers slowed to 1% from 2% a year earlier, he added.\n\nIn Argentina, another of its big emerging markets, hyperinflation has kept shoppers away from stores and led to a 4% drop in volumes.\n\nThese factors contributed to a sharp slowdown in emerging market sales, which were up 5.1% in the third quarter but a far cry from the 7.4% growth in the previous quarter. Emerging markets contribute 60% to the company\u2019s overall sales.\n\nCOMPETITIVE MARKETS\n\nGrowth in developed markets also stalled, falling 0.1% as shoppers shift to more niche products and Europe faces tougher comparisons with last year, when a warm summer boosted ice cream sales in the region.\n\nOverall, underlying sales growth rose to 2.9% in the quarter, missing an average forecast of 3%, according to a company supplied analyst consensus. That lagged rival Nestle (NESN.S), which reported 3.7% sales growth for the period.\n\nNestle also reported flat growth in China and said it has been unable to raise prices in competitive markets globally.\n\nStill, Unilever reported a 5.8% rise in turnover to 13.3 billion euros, ahead of analyst estimates, helped by acquisitions and a weaker pound.\n\nIt also stuck to its full-year target for underlying sales growth in the lower half of a 3% to 5% range and a 20% operating margin in 2020.\n\nShares in the Anglo-Dutch company were up 1.7% at 46.89 pounds in morning trade and were the third-biggest gainer on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index .FTSE. The stock is up 11.2% this year.\n\nNestle shares were down 0.5% at 105.54 Swiss francs.", "description": "A slowdown in India and China put a brake on Unilever's quarterly sales growth, highlighting the challenges facing Chief Executive Alan Jope as he tries to boost the consumer goods giant's business in emerging markets.", "authors": ["Siddharth Cavale", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441778918&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0I4", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
