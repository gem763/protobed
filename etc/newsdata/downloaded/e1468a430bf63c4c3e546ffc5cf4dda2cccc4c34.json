He would make jokes, sexualised comments and would often put his arm around you, often encroach your personal space, so much so it would make you feel really uncomfortable.\n\n'[He was] absolutely vile. If you were sat at the computer he would stand touching you with his crotch.\n\n'He'd rub his crotch against you or on the back of your chair. He put his hand over your shoulder and lean over although there were other computer terminals he could have used. And he did that with all the female PCSOs.\n\n'It almost became a running joke in the police station. Nobody wanted to be left alone with Peter Bunyan and you'd change shifts so you weren't on a late with him.'\n\nDevon and Cornwall Police has been accused of ignoring staff members who reported Bunyan (pictured) rubbing his groin on them, making sexual comments and touching them\n\nOn one occasion Alison said Bunyan revealed himself in front of other officers.\n\nShe said: 'He had a vasectomy and it became infected, apparently. One day in the office he took his testicles out to show people how infected they were. It was brought up with the sergeant a couple of days later but nothing even happened.\n\n'I was witness to many, many reports of inappropriate behaviour and none were ever taken seriously. I've never known a police officer make a complaint that was taken seriously.'\n\nAlison described how he'd disappear for hours at a time and set his radio to 'code eight', meaning that he was not contactable.\n\nShe said he would regularly go and see a woman with learning and mental health difficulties at her flat, something that became obvious to other officers.\n\nShe added: 'We had access to all the police systems and some of the most vulnerable people in society. I'm 100% confident his superiors knew his behaviour was inappropriate but maybe they didn't know the true extent of it.'\n\nThe documentary also revealed that Bunyan had been a PC in Hampshire and was being investigated when he left.\n\nBut on his PCSO application to Devon and Cornwall Police he said he left because he was 'too young'.\n\nDevon and Cornwall Police are also accused of failing to contact the Hampshire force for a reference.\n\nA total of six complaints were made against Bunyan by fellow officers.\n\nLast year Bunyan had his 24-year sentence slashed by Appeal Court judges to 16 years, with an additional year on licence.\n\nIn a statement, Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'The recruitment of Peter Bunyan was conducted according to the processes in place at the time. There were no breaches in these processes.\n\n'This is an issue we have and continue to take extremely seriously. We take every step necessary to ensure that any cases that are raised with us, or which we proactively identify, are thoroughly investigated and that appropriate measures are put in place to try to prevent future occurrences.\n\n'Like any other organisation, whether public or private, the police service has staff members who do not uphold the standards expected. Where that is identified in Devon and Cornwall Police, the Deputy Chief Constable has moved quickly to dismiss such people from the organisation.'", "description": "PCSO Peter Bunyan was locked up for 16 years for raping children as young as three.
