Trump gave an illustration at the end of the G-7 summit, when he insisted to reporters that former president Obama had been \u201coutsmarted\u201d by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump\u2019s full-blown Putin Envy was also on display. But the president\u2019s false and absurd rewriting of history seemed intended less to elevate the Russian leader than to diminish Obama. It fit a pattern that goes back years \u2014 and may have more to do with Trump\u2019s behavior in office than we realize.\n\nAt Trump\u2019s news conference Monday in Biarritz, France, the subject was whether Russia should be invited to rejoin the group of industrialized powers that used to be called the G-8. Russia was kicked out in 2014 after Putin sent military forces into neighboring Ukraine to seize and annex the Crimean Peninsula. The decision by member countries \u2014 the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy \u2014 to eject Russia, because of its unprovoked aggression, was unanimous.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s fanciful version, however, Crimea was \u201ctaken away from President Obama \u2026 It was very embarrassing to him.\u201d That embarrassment, Trump falsely claims, is the only reason Russia was kicked out of the group. Trump wants Russia readmitted. Almost all the other leaders who met in Biarritz disagree, so it\u2019s not happening.\n\nYou will recall that Trump\u2019s foreign policy, such as it is, puts \u201cAmerica First\u201d and shies from interference in other nations\u2019 affairs. You will also recall that at last year\u2019s G-7 gathering, Trump reportedly said that Crimea was really Russian all along, since most people there speak the language, and blasted Ukraine as \u201cone of the most corrupt countries in the world.\u201d These are boilerplate Russian talking points; if Trump is taking his cues from Putin, he has learned his lines well.\n\nBy Trump\u2019s \u201clogic,\u201d then, there\u2019s no blame to apportion. And, of course, he offers no suggestion as to what Obama might have done to prevent the Russian invasion. But truth never matters much with Trump, and it matters not at all when he\u2019s attacking Obama.\n\nTrump blasts the Obama administration\u2019s record of creating jobs and claims to be doing much better. Yet under Obama the unemployment rate fell from a high of nearly 10% to just 4.7%. Under Trump, it dropped further to 3.7%. Which president had the bigger impact?\n\nTrump blames Obama for being soft on illegal immigration, yet he deports fewer undocumented migrants than Obama did. And when Obama left office, undocumented border crossings were at a multi-year low. The huge increase, driven in part by asylum-seekers from Central America, has taken place under Trump.\n\nThe president tries to blame his own administration\u2019s cruel immigration policies on Obama \u2014 separating thousands of families at the border and keeping children in cages. This is just a flat-out lie. Obama\u2019s policy was to keep asylum-seeking families together. Trump decided to separate them as a deterrent, telling Central Americans that if they did not want to suffer such a fate, they should stay home.\n\nTrump is so fixated on trying to erase Obama\u2019s accomplishments that he repeatedly acts against his own interests. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, negotiated by the Obama administration, even though the pact would have been a valuable tool in Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war against China. Trump has tried repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 apparently because it\u2019s called Obamacare \u2014 even though he offers nothing to replace it and must be aware that the health care issue helped Democrats gain control of the House. Trump rages on Twitter against automakers who have agreed to essentially abide by Obama administration rules mandating increased fuel economy, even though the Trump administration is prepared to let them pollute more.\n\nTrump even complains about the lucrative book deal Obama made after leaving the White House. Jealous much?\n\nObviously, I can\u2019t know for sure what the root cause of Trump\u2019s Obama obsession might be. Everyone should remember, though, that he was an active and vocal proponent of the racist \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory, at one point claiming, without evidence, that he had sent investigators to Hawaii to discover the \u201ctruth\u201d about Obama\u2019s birth certificate.\n\nTrump seems terrified that history will look kindlier on Obama\u2019s presidency than on his own. If that\u2019s the case \u2014 on this one point \u2014 he couldn\u2019t be more right.\n\n\u2014 Eugene Robinson\u2019s email address is eugenerobinson@washpost.com.", "description": "", "authors": ["Eugene Robinson"], "top_image": "https://www.timesheraldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/VAL-Filler-PhotoCORRECT-SIZE.png"}
