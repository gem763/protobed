This goes beyond what are now considered basics such as nutritional food that is available 24/7, or access to the vast majority of the world\u2019s information. This attitude even touches our perception of services such as social media.\n\nWe justify our incessant use of social media (the average person spends 153 minutes a day on it) by waxing lyrical about all the good it\u2019s brought us, such as the ability to stay in touch with our loved ones across the world, connect with people we might not otherwise have encountered, and talk to almost anyone instantaneously, without having to wait days for a response.\n\nHowever, as the pernicious effects of social media become more clear, it\u2019s evident that something has to give when it comes to collective societal attitudes towards it. With levels of anxiety and depression at all-time highs among young people, especially Gen Z, it\u2019s time we take stock of the true danger that such heavy usage brings.\n\nInstagram to consider dumping 'likes' on posts in move that could improve teen mental health\n\nFirst off, it\u2019s obvious \u2013 according to a growing body of research \u2013 that this level of social media engagement does real damage. The American Journal of Epidemiology found that \u201cregular Facebook use had a negative impact on a user\u2019s well-being\u201d, with other sources reporting afflictions such as loss of sleep, anxiety, and a lowered attention span, all taking root partly or fully in the vertiginous rise in social media usage over the last five or so years.\n\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, it\u2019s easy to see why social media has this effect on us. We\u2019re wired to be hyper-responsive to social cues, as our ability to pay attention to such cues would have meant the difference between life or death on the savannah.\n\nOn top of that, the world\u2019s top technology companies pay experts millions of dollars a year to exploit our own brains. Tristan Harris, an ex-Google employee, was so aghast at his company\u2019s practices that he penned a 141-slide treatise urging Google to be ethical with their users\u2019 attention, before jumping ship to found Time Well Spent, a non-profit organisation aiming to reverse the \u201cdigital attention crisis\u201d.\n\nNow, social media certainly has its advantages. But it\u2019s incumbent upon each of us, individually, to look lucidly at the risk-reward offering of such technologies, and to develop our own philosophies regarding how we want to use them, as opposed to simply following the default doctrine of constant usage encouraged by Silicon Valley.", "description": "It's important to look at the negative effects sites like Facebook can have on our well-being and to weigh the pros and cons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/6e2569ee-e0ed-11e9-94c8-f27aa1da2f45imagehires141052.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
