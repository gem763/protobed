After several years living under the same roof, one member of the shared house plucks up the courage to declare their love to another as the sun sets on a midsummer evening.\n\nWe have all been that person, or seen this movie. But when Katherine Brunt sidled up next to Nat Sciver to take her romantic plunge, there was a twist. This wasn\u2019t going down in a beer garden or their sitting room after one too many drinks at the end of a Sunday session. Rather, this was all happening on the renowned balcony in front of the home dressing room at Lord\u2019s. Better still, only a couple of hours earlier, the pair had won a World Cup final together in the most dramatic circumstances.\n\nI know there is nobody who is better for me Katherine Brunt\n\nYes, came the response. Yes, Sciver would be Brunt\u2019s girlfriend. Just under 18 months later, on New Year\u2019s Eve last year, it was the fast bowler \u2013 the greatest to represent the England women\u2019s team \u2013 once again asking the question. The big one. And once again, there was never any doubt about the response from the champion all-rounder. On Friday, on National Coming Out Day \u2013 a happiest of coincidences \u2013 they announce their engagement.\n\n\u201cI knew it was right,\u201d recalls Brunt of her timing on that life-changing evening in July 2017. \u201cI know there is nobody who is better for me. I had put it off but then I just asked her. I am shit at remembering dates but I knew that I would never forget that one. Genius from me.\u201d\n\nHaving by then house-shared for four years Sciver had long since wanted more to come of the friendship. \u201cShe was madly in love with me!\u201d Brunt jumps in. \u201cBut I was constantly putting her at arm\u2019s length because I didn\u2019t think it was professional and I didn\u2019t want to stuff up our friendship.\u201d\n\nCricket Australia reveals ground-breaking parental leave policy for players Read more\n\nYet for all the lovely romantic retelling, including getting lost when trying to find the specific riverbank spot where they had earlier enjoyed a special moment in France \u2013 covered in snow the second time around \u2013 there is a sharper edge to this, which is why this has remained a private matter until now. They told all to their delighted England teammates right away, but taking the news beyond the women\u2019s cricket enclave wasn\u2019t so easy.\n\n\u201cMy parents are different to Natalie\u2019s,\u201d Brunt explains of living as an openly gay woman. \u201cThey are quite Christian so it is not something that is done and that\u2019s why it has held me back. They don\u2019t believe in the way I choose to live my life, basically, so it has been quite difficult. Having to tell my parents was really difficult because I care a lot about them so it was something I put off for a long, long time. But as I have got older, I have seen sense and realised that it is not about that, it is about being yourself and living life properly.\n\n\u201cMy parents love me: there is no questioning that. They will always be there for me and support me. They are still my parents and they still love me, so it is a compromise I have to take but I am ok with that.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Katherine Brunt and Nat Sciver at the NatWest PCA Awards at The Roundhouse this month.

But to deny her truth was no longer sustainable, not with her and Sciver \u2013 who came out to her family within weeks of the relationship beginning \u2013 so happy together.\n\nFor Sciver, the pressure hasn\u2019t been quite the same. However, the 27-year-old believes this step will add to her confidence. \u201cThere is still something holding me back a little bit in everyday life,\u201d she observes. \u201cSubconsciously, there is a reason why I might put my hand in my pocket or avoid conversations about my relationships.\u201d\n\nI am trying to persuade Katherine to have at least one child Nat Sciver\n\nBrunt has behaved similarly. \u201cTo this day, if someone asks me if I am with someone I say \u2018yes\u2019 and that\u2019s where it will stop. I am trying to change that now for myself because it is wrong and I shouldn\u2019t have to feel like that. There are times since we got engaged that I don\u2019t wear my engagement ring because I try to avoid somebody asking me.\u201d No more of that from now on.\n\nAs teammates, they speak of being able to provide unique support to each other in the tough world of professional sport. When Brunt\u2019s back gave way in St Lucia ahead of last year\u2019s World T20, it was Sciver dressing Brunt, comforting her at night as she cried in pain. Without her there, Brunt hints, retirement might have arrived there and then.\n\nThen, on the good days, they get to share in some of the happiest moments of their lives, such as that famous World Cup win. Predictably, that doesn\u2019t mean they are any less fierce in the nets, Brunt boasting she bowls more bouncers to her partner than anyone else in practice.\n\nThey have had their battles as opponents, even if they would prefer not to be rivals. Helpfully, that changes next year with the initiation of The Hundred: Brunt and Sciver were purchased as a couple by the Nottingham-based Trent Rockets. There is every chance in that tournament they will play against another married couple, South Africa\u2019s Marizanne Kapp and Dane van Niekerk. \u201cThey are people to look up to,\u201d Sciver says of the Proteas pair, who have played under her leadership in the Kia Super League over the past three years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Katherine Brunt and Nat Sciver in Cardiff during the 2015 Ashes.

That has led Sciver to consider the maternity leave provisions that exist in their own contracts. Although, with Brunt far closer to the end of her cricket career, they both laugh, it might influence who does the child carrying \u2013 initially, at least.\n\n\u201cI am trying to persuade Katherine to have at least one child,\u201d she says. \u201cI do have child-bearing hips!\u201d comes the immediate response from her wife-to-be. \u201cI have got to have one when I retire soon or Nat is going to have to take some time out of cricket. It\u2019s one or the other.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s entirely possible at some stage both might choose to have babies.\n\nFor the nuptials, they will be back where they were engaged: the serene holiday home Sciver has enjoyed visiting since she was a child in the Chamonix Valley. Their main worry, for now, is getting the marquee sorted \u2013 weddings are weddings. As for when, the very moment they have finished their series against India next September.
