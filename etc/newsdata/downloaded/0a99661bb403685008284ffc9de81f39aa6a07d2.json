Prigozhin was indicted for allegedly helping to fund the Russian disinformation campaigns that targeted the U.S. presidential election around 2016.\n\nSeveral of the disinformation efforts disclosed Wednesday targeted countries with Russia-friendly political messaging during election periods or times of political instability.\n\nIn the Central African Republic, according to the Stanford researchers, the operation created a network of Facebook pages to publicize and praise Russian activities in the country. \"These Pages, most of which had administrators in Madagascar, seem to have been intended to appear organic and give CAR audiences the impression of widespread domestic support for the administration of President Touad\u00e9ra and its Russian partners,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nAnd in Mozambique, fake pages churned out messaging in support of the incumbent president ahead of the country's presidential and parliamentary elections, the researchers found.\n\nFor years, Russia been ramping up its efforts to increase the Kremlin's political power in various African countries, and the latest announcement shows it has been using its infamous disinformation tactics to drill in that foothold. Many of the fake pages linked to Russian state media and lauded the country's foreign policy decisions.\n\nWednesday's announcement also shows Russia has been honing its disinformation skills as it pays subcontractors adept in local languages to spread its messages.\n\n\"This investigation demonstrates a fundamental challenge of attributing information operations: disentangling activity by domestic interested parties, foreign actors working on behalf of domestic parties and foreign actors working in support of their own geopolitical or commercial interests,\" the Stanford researchers wrote.", "description": "Facebook on\u00a0Wednesday announced that it had removed\u00a0a wide-ranging Russian disinformation campaign\u00a0targeting African countries,\u00a0linking\u00a0the network of\u00a0fake accounts\u00a0to\u00a0a Russian oligarch previously indicted", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/russianflag_081119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
