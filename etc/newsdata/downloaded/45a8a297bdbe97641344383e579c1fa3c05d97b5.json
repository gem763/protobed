Below is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation.\n\nNilay Patel: Panos Panay, chief product officer at Microsoft. Welcome to The Vergecast.\n\nPanos Panay: Thanks, man. It\u2019s great to be here.\n\nNP: Thank you for coming on.\n\nI love it.\n\nNP: Big day today.\n\nWe had a fun day. Team had a big day.\n\nNP: I really want to talk about the Surface Duo, but you announced a whole bunch of other stuff.\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nNP: So here\u2019s my plan \u2014 because we\u2019ve got to mention it all \u2014 I\u2019m going to say the names of some products you announced, and you\u2019re going to give me one sentence about them.\n\nNP: Surface Pro 7.\n\nSuper powerful. It\u2019s the product everybody loves.\n\nNP: Surface Laptop [3] 13 [inches].\n\nIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing you\u2019ll set your eye on relative to a laptop.\n\nNP: Surface Laptop [3] 15 [inches].\n\nIt competes with the 13 for beauty, but it\u2019s a super beast in performance.\n\nNP: This is great. You\u2019re prepared for this. It\u2019s amazing.\n\nI live it, man. I\u2019m prepared for anything.\n\nNP: I was really not expecting you to be this crisp with it.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t prepare for anything. I have no time. I just have to show up and tell you what I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m not sure what else is supposed to happen.\n\nNP: Surface [Ear]buds.\n\nKiller audio. Incredible audio. And then translation is, it\u2019s sick. When you\u2019re in PowerPoint translating on those things, it is a blast.\n\nNP: It is amazing that you announced truly wireless headphones, and the killer use case is, like, \u201cPowerPoint.\u201d\n\nOh heck yeah, man. Are you kidding?\n\nNP: That\u2019s the most Microsoft thing I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life.\n\nIt was so good, though. I can\u2019t explain it to you. Say whatever you want. It wasn\u2019t a Microsoft thing. Everybody has headphones. Everybody has earbuds. Come on. Ask me whatever you want about the Earbuds. They are awesome. They really are awesome.\n\nNP: It\u2019s the [Surface] Pro X and the Neo and the Duo that I really want to talk about. The other stuff is really interesting. That\u2019s why I wanted to make sure we mentioned them all.\n\nIt\u2019s the core of our product line, and that\u2019s what people use today. You know, we talk about where people are today and meeting them there. Then we talk about how this is as a team, how we get people to where they\u2019re going. And then we land, making sure we have products for when they get there. And I think you\u2019re talking about Neo and Duo are where products are going to be. I think Pro X is the one that moves people tech-forward a little bit. And the other products are the things you need right now.\n\nNP: Obviously, the Earbuds are new, but the other ones seem like these are very careful refinements of things that people already love.\n\nThey are, and there\u2019s a lot in there. The laptop is now repairable, but it\u2019s the same beautiful product, you know? No screws, no trap doors, anything like that. That\u2019s a big deal for commercial customers or even, you want to replace your keyboard or whatever. We can do it pretty easy. And so I think when we talk about making these objects of desire, if you will, and something precious, [that] you\u2019re going to buy and take care of.\n\nBut in general, we\u2019ve been pretty diligent about not letting anybody crack them open or repair them. Not that we tried to do that. It was just how the design came together. And now, we\u2019ve been very diligent in our history and learning and just getting a little bit more mature as an organization, a team, how we build products that are a little more accessible to get into a little, a lot more inclusive. And so you start to see that on the laptops. So they\u2019re refinements, yeah, but they\u2019re also wholly reengineered.\n\nNP: We talk about this every time, so I\u2019m going to ask one question about the Pro 7. I bet you can guess what it is. It has USB-C. You did it.\n\nI don\u2019t even know why we want to talk about it. You love talking about this topic.\n\nNP: Why USB-C and not Thunderbolt?\n\nTom Warren: That\u2019s because of the Surface Connect, right?\n\nYeah, you get Surface Connect. You get everything you need out of the product through Surface Connect, especially the powerhouse customer. There are just trade-offs in anything when you\u2019re designing something \u2014 what you\u2019re doing with performance, battery, how you think about thickness \u2014 they\u2019re all just subtle trade-offs. And at the end of the day, I thought if I didn\u2019t do it, I\u2019d come to this Vergecast, and you\u2019d do nothing but complain.\n\nAnd then we did it, and now you\u2019re still complaining. Now I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nNP: This is our role in the market.\n\nYou do an incredible job at it. You guys are really good at this.\n\nNP: Let\u2019s talk about the Pro X. It\u2019s ARM. You\u2019re making your own chip, the Surface SQ1 chip. You\u2019re doing it in partnership with Qualcomm. The first question I got when I said, \u201cWhat do people want to know?\u201d on Twitter was about app support. How should people expect app support to work with Windows on ARM on that device?\n\nThat\u2019s a great question. So the Windows team has done a phenomenal job, specifically because of this product. Driving forward, we talk a lot about how we\u2019re going to create silicon or create a product where we can pull the whole ecosystem through and make sure we\u2019re making the right investments across the board as Microsoft. And in this one, the Windows team, it\u2019s incredible the work they\u2019re doing to basically use emulating technology to run all apps.\n\nNP: So you get everything?\n\nYou pretty much get everything. I mean, there\u2019s going to be a few things that you don\u2019t get. I think if you\u2019re a user that wants to go into sort of the product or the app you can\u2019t get or the software you can\u2019t get, you don\u2019t want Pro X anyway. That\u2019s not your product. And so for the user that\u2019s going to use that product, yeah, you get everything. I mean, Chrome runs on it. Chrome\u2019s one of the biggest things where when you put the product out there, first feedback, if it doesn\u2019t run Chrome, there\u2019s immediate reaction. iTunes is another one.\n\nNP: I get Chrome. I cannot say that I understand iTunes. You\u2019ve said it to me a couple of times, and it\u2019s surprising.\n\nIt\u2019s actually true. I\u2019m just looking at the data and, you know, those are both good products in many ways. Great products, really. One of the product ethos is, \u201cHey, where are our customers at?\u201d Hence Android: where they at, and how do we support them? Let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re doing what we can.\n\nNP: Who do you think the customer for the Pro X is?\n\nYou know, we have a bunch of fancy words to talk about that, but ultimately, when we designed it, it was for a tech-forward, mobile professional. That\u2019s what it is. And so if you\u2019re leaning into tech, and you want something a little bit cutting edge, this is a great product. It\u2019s crazy cool. If you work on a train, a bus, a plane, if you\u2019re ride-sharing in a car, you like working at the park or at Starbucks, that\u2019s a mobile user to me. They use their products everywhere. It\u2019s perfect for that.\n\nNP: So, obviously, with the Qualcomm processor, you get always-on, you get built-in connectivity, you get a bunch of stuff that the ARM platform can do.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s right.\n\nNP: Is that what drove you to do ARM, or was it other stuff you just couldn\u2019t do with x86?\n\nNo, there\u2019s a lot of stuff. It\u2019s not one variable, and check off that box, and say, \u201cNo, we\u2019ve got it.\u201d Instant on, it works. No, it\u2019s not like that.\n\nI think one of the things is: how do you push the form factor forward? So how do we manage the power, [performance], heat profile of a device? And that then dictates how thin you can push it and how much battery you have to put in it. Battery is basically a function of size. The bigger it is, the more battery life you have. And the bigger it is, the heavier the device is, the bigger it is, the thicker it is. How can we optimize the entire product line and then give you the best screen possible? Because there\u2019s where the trade-off starts to fall in play.\n\nThe bigger your screen is, the more pixels you push. The brighter your screen is, the more damage to your battery life, in theory. The more battery life you need, the thicker your battery has to be. And now you\u2019re in this trade-off of weight and thickness. And I think in the 2-in-1 category \u2014 and what we\u2019re doing is pushing that category forward \u2014 it means this: making products thinner, lighter, faster, with more battery life. It\u2019s not a complex equation. It is hard to solve for, but it\u2019s not hard to understand that that\u2019s what people need or want. And this chip does all that.\n\nTW: Do you think you\u2019ll get to this little of a design and that sort of trade-off on the Intel side?\n\nFor sure. Intel is doing some incredible work, but we think about all these products a little bit differently. But yeah, what Intel does, they\u2019re incredible partners to us. They\u2019ve been phenomenal in partnering and designing chipsets together.\n\nI think it\u2019s just that diversity is a great thing in the silicon world. In general, let customers have a choice. I think that\u2019s all right. At the end of the day, though, I really want people to buy Surface, so it\u2019s: what\u2019s the right product? What\u2019s the right chip to build it from? And I think SQ1 is a phenomenal step forward for a lot of reasons.\n\nNP: Why build your own?\n\nBecause we want to design from the inside out from the beginning. And so when we have the steps, here\u2019s what the product\u2019s going to be, here\u2019s what we want to deliver, here\u2019s what we think we\u2019re going to go after. You\u2019ve got a couple of design points we wanted to hit.\n\nAnd so we sat with the leaders over at Qualcomm, had great conversations, and got to the point of saying, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nNP: What was the biggest thing that you asked for that they didn\u2019t have on the shelf?\n\nIt\u2019s a combination of so many things, but to get to 5.3mm of thickness with all that performance, it was virtually impossible before we started this program.\n\nNP: So this leads me to the Duo, which there\u2019s...\n\nBig jump.\n\nNP: I\u2019ve got a segue.\n\nThat\u2019s an incredible jump. You\u2019re going to only hear it because I feel like you just literally made up a segue.\n\nNP: I really want to talk about the Duo.\n\nI feel like you just wanted to say \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the Duo. Here\u2019s my lead.\u201d\n\nNP: It\u2019s sitting in front of me, and it\u2019s taunting me.\n\nThat\u2019s not my fault.\n\nNP: The Duo has a Snapdragon 855. Why doesn\u2019t it have an SQ1 on it? That\u2019s my segue.\n\nBecause you don\u2019t need to push that much wattage through the product. So now the design point for SQ1, it\u2019s not a mobile processor. Let me clarify that for you. A mobile processor is going to push two to three watts, maybe two and a half, something like that. If you\u2019re going to get to the SQ1, we\u2019re pushing it seven, seven a half. When you\u2019re pushing power through that thing, it\u2019s now a PC architecture part.\n\nThe mobile architecture hasn\u2019t really moved to the PC. There have been some mobile architecture PCs, but PC-architecture based products coming from mobile, that doesn\u2019t exist. That\u2019s what SQ1 does. You could push two 4K displays at 60Hz at the same time off of a mobile [chip]? Not possible. But you can on an SQ1. So the idea that all the IOs work, that Surface Connect works, that we can push what people come to expect from Surface. That\u2019s what that part does. When you put the mobile processing in here, that\u2019s what you need. That\u2019s what it is.\n\nNP: So you said, I think very directly, it\u2019s not a phone. You said to our friend Lauren Goode at Wired, it\u2019s not a phone. It seems like a phone. You can fold it the other way. It shows you a phone. You show people making calls with it.\n\nYeah, of course. Look, it\u2019s a great phone. That\u2019s not what I mean by \u201cit\u2019s not a phone.\u201d I feel like \u201cphone\u201d is such a limiting word. And then you say, \u201cwell, smartphone.\u201d I don\u2019t even know what that means. And then phablet. I\u2019m not sure what that is. But everything has an identifying factor to it. Even when we started Surface, people are like, \u201cSo it\u2019s a tablet.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cIt\u2019s not a tablet. It\u2019s just not a tablet. It\u2019s a Surface.\u201d I don\u2019t know what to say. And you want to categorize it, and put it there.\n\nI think if you\u2019re going to create a new category, you\u2019re going to try to change things, push things forward. The minute you put it in a box, I think you\u2019re lost. So I\u2019ve been pretty resistant to that. Not because it doesn\u2019t act like a great phone.\n\nNP: It\u2019s not coming out for a year, right? So holiday 2020. You\u2019ve got a year to figure out how people are going to use it.\n\nYeah.\n\nNP: But right now\u2014\n\nBut for everyone listening, Pro X is coming out right now. So that\u2019s, there\u2019s a delta there, just to make sure.\n\nNP: Right. And then the Neo, which is the larger\u2014\n\nThey\u2019re both holiday 2020.\n\nNP: So dual screen is holiday 2020.\n\nYeah, I think this category kind of lights up 2020. Yeah, that\u2019s a good way to say it.\n\nNP: Well, it\u2019s funny. The last time I talked to you, I remember we had a very spirited discussion about the Galaxy Fold, and you thought that was a fairly silly design decision to use a plastic screen.\n\nI don\u2019t remember saying that, really. I don\u2019t think I said that. I may have, but I can\u2019t remember.\n\nNP: Plausible deniability\u2019s fine! It turned out to have been a fairly silly design decision at that time. They\u2019re doing it again, but that\u2019s like a first-generation foldable in a different way. You\u2019re doing two screens with a hinge, and you think a year from now, it\u2019s actually going to start taking off.\n\nI absolutely think so. Yeah. I think we\u2019ve seen what dual-screen use brings, and we\u2019ve tested thousands and thousands of scenarios with thousands of people. We measure so many different things. We measure the brain activity. We measure how people feel. We ask thousands of questions, and we have an incredible user research team, human factors team, from an inclusive design standpoint. Just thinking about how everyone would use this device, no matter who you are and all the way through. And yeah, I\u2019m 100 percent sure at this point. Like I said, I think it\u2019s a bold statement, but I really do believe in where this category can go. I hope. I\u2019m pretty sure people will see it pretty quick.\n\nNP: So just a history of technology: Microsoft was a dominant operating system vendor, a dominant platform vendor. There was a form factor shift to mobile. It created an entry point [for others]. We\u2019ve seen how that played out. You think holiday 2020 is a form factor shift to dual screen that lets Microsoft get back in the mobile market?\n\nI don\u2019t think it happens that fast, no. I don\u2019t think it happens that fast. I think it starts. I think you start to understand how much more productive and creative you can be on both Windows and Android. I think that consistency of it, whichever operating system you\u2019re on, it still, you can be productive with two screens.\n\nNP: But do you think people are going to buy this as a replacement for their phone?\n\nYeah, I think some people. Other people will just want it because maybe it\u2019s cool. There\u2019s something about it that\u2019s attractive for sure. And I do think people will replace their phone. I think [some] people will buy it as a second device, and I think it works pretty well both ways.\n\nNP: So talk to me about Android. What\u2019s it like working with Google? What\u2019s that relationship like? Is this a Play Store device?\n\nYeah, absolutely. Google search, for sure. Also Bing search. It\u2019s pretty cool. There\u2019s some great concepts between the two companies.\n\nTW: But why Android?\n\nWell, because those are the apps you want.\n\nNP: It\u2019s just that simple?\n\nI don\u2019t know how to answer it differently for you. Yeah. Because there\u2019s hundreds of thousands of apps and you want them. And [Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella] and I talk about it, and it\u2019s about meeting our customers where they are, where they\u2019re going to be. And I don\u2019t think the mobile application platform\u2019s going anywhere anytime soon, and it\u2019s pretty simple. I\u2019m not trying to be smart about it, either. Like, literally, Tom, it\u2019s: you need the apps.\n\nNow, how do we get developers to look at the APIs that are going to be across the platforms and how you can think about a 360-degree hinge? How we can light up xCloud on the product with the game on one side, controls on the other? The way two screens interact with each other when you open two apps. You can kind of see the power of it pretty quick.\n\nNP: He\u2019s taunting us by showing us the device right now.\n\nSo you can just see it, right? You see you\u2019re in mail, and what if you needed to copy something over and drag it over to your last app? These sorts of things that are complex tasks where you have to context-switch all the time. In this product, they come to life quick.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on in the sense that if I were just to open the calendar for you. So there\u2019s calendar, and I\u2019ll just span it between the two screens. You see it come to life there. Watch the calendar snap on the seam, which I love. I mean, I celebrate this seam. It\u2019s huge. Because it really does put apps in layers for you, or structures [them]. These structured thoughts happen, and you watch the brain light up, and things are easier. It\u2019s pretty cool.\n\nThe things that can happen and you\u2019re now in kind of this place where it becomes a little bit limitless in what you can create or do if you\u2019re a developer. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping for.\n\nSo for that reason, we came out with the products today, which was not a fun decision. We haven\u2019t done that. I don\u2019t know how to. So we\u2019re learning, you know, humbly. I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re learning. I don\u2019t know if we did the right thing or wrong thing, but we do want to inspire developers.\n\nNP: How much do you think the product will change between now and holiday 2020?\n\nThe hardware won\u2019t change at all. We\u2019ve been designing this hardware for how long, Pete [Kyriacou, GM of Microsoft devices]? Three years? We\u2019ve been in about three and a half. It\u2019s been a long time. And I think you know that. You\u2019ve unpacked it on me a couple of times with your unbelievable spy skills or whatever you got.\n\nNP: It\u2019s reporting. It\u2019s called reporting.\n\nOh, reporting.\n\nNP: That\u2019s what that is.\n\nGeez, I missed that. Do people curse on The Vergecast?\n\nNP: Yeah, go nuts.\n\nOkay. Thanks. Just checking.\n\nNP: No FCC here.\n\nYou almost got me there. You almost got me.\n\nNP: So historically, there\u2019ve been a lot of companies that have tried to take Android and build software experiences on top of it. I would say, historically, those companies have not been as good at software is Microsoft, or as good at design as Microsoft. And Google has pulled them back. Is Google letting you build your own Android experience?\n\nI don\u2019t think this is a \u201cletting\u201d conversation at all. I think this is a partnering conversation. I think the conversations we\u2019ve been having and the work we\u2019ve done together, it\u2019s pretty cool. Like, you can see it. If I go back one screen. Once you slide over here, look, check it out. You\u2019ve got Google search here. You got the entire Microsoft feed here.\n\nHiroshi [Lockheimer, head of Android at Google] and I sat down. We had this conversation and it was, \u201cLook, here\u2019s the vision. We want to make the best of Microsoft on the Android that people know.\u201d So the idea wasn\u2019t... I mean, if you look here, you\u2019ll see the app launcher come up just like you would have on an Android phone. And then if you pull down from the top, you\u2019ll see the settings. Like we\u2019re not trying to be\u2014\n\nNP: But that settings looks a little bit different than a standard. You\u2019ve done some design work.\n\nThere\u2019s some, of course. There\u2019s the design work, but it\u2019s what you know. It\u2019s a Surface.\n\nTW: Is it like an extension of the Microsoft Launcher [for Android]?\n\nSo the Launcher team is a huge part of this program. They\u2019re amazing. You can think of it that way a little bit. We\u2019re not putting Launcher on top. That\u2019s not it. But the Launcher team is doing a ton of work bringing together this connected experience with the cloud. It\u2019s very cool. Very cool. I won\u2019t share too much because I can\u2019t give too much of it away.\n\nTW: So what are the gives and takes between Microsoft and Google. Are we going to see Google search integrated into Windows?\n\nWe\u2019re probably not going to talk about that today, Tom. Not to be rude, but I think just... there\u2019s a lot there. Not in gives and takes. That\u2019s not what I mean. But in the sense of our relationship is, it\u2019s building. it\u2019s pretty deep-rooted, and we\u2019re partnering. That\u2019s the best way to think about it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s give-and-take.\n\nI think it\u2019s about: what\u2019s the right product to build for people? That\u2019s how I feel. I think that\u2019s how my counterparts over in Google feel, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to go do. I think people will love it, though. For that reason. Because that\u2019s the ethos.\n\nNP: Satya Nadella said today that Windows the operating system is not the whole point anymore. It\u2019s apps and services. Microsoft has moved its entire business there. How are you thinking about Android? You make a whole line of Windows devices. How are you thinking about them as complements? How are they going to tie together? Or is Android the future for you?\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You want to give customers what they want in the form factor that they\u2019re using. It would be silly to be like, \u201cLet\u2019s shove...\u201d We\u2019ve learned this. \u201cLet\u2019s put the wrong operating system, the right operating system on the wrong product\u201d or the other way around, pick your words.\n\nBut what\u2019s the right operating system for the form factor? And in this case, on mobile devices, Android\u2019s the obvious choice. But anything above that, Windows is everything. Superior for me in the product design. I\u2019m not trying to sound arrogant, I promise you. It comes from a humble place, but my belief in Windows is so strong, and what you can accomplish with it.\n\nNow to Satya\u2019s point, how the OS disappears in the background, I think Microsoft does an incredible job of that, enabling people to be more productive and achieve and all the great things.\n\nNP: So you\u2019ve got Windows 10X, which is for the Neo, which is the dual-screen version [of Windows].\n\nYeah. That\u2019s Windows.\n\nNP: It is not going to come to different form factors? Is it exclusively for dual screen?\n\nThink of it this way: right now, it\u2019s for dual screen. I think it\u2019s hard to use the word \u201cexclusive\u201d for anything right now. It\u2019s so early. We\u2019re learning, and I think that\u2019s part of the growth mindset of the company. We have that filter.\n\nWe\u2019re going to listen, and we got some time. We\u2019re going to listen to developers pretty close. We\u2019ve been looking at the products for three years, both of them. It\u2019s been a while. It\u2019s a blur. But yeah, you learn through this process. That\u2019s a big part of product-making. And I\u2019m not saying learn by making mistakes. We\u2019re going to take our time, and get it right. I would say the form factor you\u2019re looking at... You should just hold it just to feel it.\n\nNP: Yes, please.\n\nJust feel the hinge. I think the form factor is a third-generation form factor. This is not like, \u201cHey it\u2019s first-gen. It might work.\u201d That\u2019s not the case. We\u2019re literally on the third gen of that hinge, the third gen of that screen. Our partners are incredible. How we integrate the Gorilla glass, that\u2019s all been failed through. Now, how we get that interaction model perfect and get connected with developers? That\u2019s why we came out today. That was important.\n\nNP: How soon can developers get their hands on these things?\n\nYou know, it depends. We\u2019re working on the stability of the product in the builds and so forth. And the way hardware works, we got probably a couple more months. They\u2019re going to have their hands on it and be running.\n\nNP: Full-speed.\n\nYeah. It\u2019s just a matter of shoring up the APIs and making sure we\u2019re ready to go.\n\nNP: What\u2019s the pricing on that thing? It\u2019s going to be like\u2014\n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you. I\u2019m not going to tell you.\n\nNP: Am I going to be happy or unhappy?\n\nSuper happy.\n\nNP: Describe my feelings in the future.\n\nYou will be elated.\n\nNP: I like elated.\n\nYeah. I think you\u2019ll be pretty pumped about it. I am. And so I think, when you say you\u2019re on the third generation of hardware, you\u2019re kind of pushing the boundary already on the silicon. You\u2019re pushing your boundary on how this thing lays out, how the antennas are coming together. When I say happy, I think the value of the product you get for how much you\u2019re paying, it\u2019s there, and that\u2019s what matters to customers.\n\nNP: So last question is, just a big think about form factors, sizes, operating systems. You have one big competitor in Apple that is pretty good at phones.\n\nYeah.\n\nNP: Pretty good at tablets.\n\nYeah.\n\nNP: Pretty good at laptops.\n\nYeah. I\u2019d say great at all those things.\n\nNP: Google is pretty good at phones.\n\nYep.\n\nNP: Pretty okay at laptops.\n\nOkay.\n\nNP: Horrible at tablets.\n\nOkay.\n\nNP: You guys are really good at laptops. Really good at Surface devices, which often look like tablets to me.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s fine. You can say that.\n\nNP: Historically not great at phones.\n\nI think when you build a product, you just don\u2019t think that way, but you identify it the way you want.\n\nNP: There\u2019s a gap that you\u2019re bridging: Surface, phone, and the tablet. Does this just fill a hole for both [Microsoft and Google]? Do they get better tablet experiences, and do you get\u2014\n\nOh, that\u2019s interesting.\n\n\u2014an entry point into mobile?\n\nYeah, no. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that complex, actually. I mean, that\u2019s a good theoretical point, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve thought about it that way.\n\nNP: Because I can just see... you put this one out next year, it does well.\n\nGod, I hope you\u2019re right.\n\nNP: And then you build a larger one, right? A slightly larger one that runs right up against the Neo.\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t see that. I can see my road map. I can see it three years out, and I\u2019m not, like, \u201cI\u2019ve had visions.\u201d I can, like, physically see it, the road map. We have every iteration of these products out there. I think what you\u2019re saying is not where I\u2019m seeing things.\n\nAt the end of the day, Windows is doing its job well. It\u2019s incredible, literally for anything bigger than this device. Now, anything bigger in between Neo and Duo, I think, is stuck. So when I say anything bigger, I don\u2019t see anything smaller than 2.9 inches, and I don\u2019t see anything bigger than this. When we picked this product, we literally looked for years at screen sizes. What\u2019s the right thing to do?\n\nYou identify different products. It\u2019s got to be like this: what people like. And eventually, we got to: what are people going to do, and what\u2019s the right size, and what\u2019s the biggest we can make it, but still make it as small as it can be? And I know that sounds like a kind of an oxymoron, but that was the push.\n\nWe found the design point of where I think the largest product can be in the mobile space. That\u2019s what I believe. And so I say that where I could be wrong, but I also say that I look at my road map, and we\u2019re not looking at anything bigger than this. I never share my road map.\n\nNP: We keep trying, yeah.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried... and your reporting, spying, whatever it is, identifies some shit sometimes. And it just drives me nuts. I was really frustrated with the leak two days ago. You guys have no idea.\n\nNP: Tell me more.\n\nThat leak came through, and I was like, \u201cWhat happened? What happened?\u201d Basically, the Laptop leak, the Surface Pro leak, Surface Pro X leak. Those three products leaked. I was proud of the team. I was proud of the way everyone handled that. I\u2019m proud of the way we reacted.\n\nNP: You said onstage, \u201cI\u2019ve seen all the leaks, too, but I got one more moment.\u201d\n\nYou know, I was talking to Yusuf [Mehdi], basically our CMO of Surface, and he was like, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d I was... okay. But we had a good time thinking about that.\n\nNP: What\u2019s the thing you want people to focus on in this year? Because there are going to be competitors coming out. You\u2019re going to hit the second generation of some of your competitors when you come out. How do you want people to think about this device for the next year?\n\nI really want people to think about the holiday lineup as the Surface PCs that we just shipped. We\u2019re pretty proud of those, and we want people to buy them. That\u2019s true.\n\nThen Duo. I think, like anything, look at the product that you think is most interesting to you and where you think you can be more creative. That\u2019s where I would push. I think this product is going to be there next year. If you\u2019re not in a hurry, hang out and see what happens and what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s going to be all right. Take photos or do whatever it is you do on your phone today for a little bit longer, and then we\u2019ll see if we can convince you that you can be more creative on this product.\n\nNP: This is great, in the context of the last round of phone reviews where everyone was like, maybe keep your phone for 20 years. It\u2019s good enough, right?\n\nIt\u2019s funny, I haven\u2019t read phone reviews. I don\u2019t really look at other phones. I know that I take photos with my phone, like I take a lot of pictures. But I want to extend that. I told a story today. It was a real story, where you know how many times I start mail on my phone? And I move to my Surface.\n\nLike simple mails or short mails or I\u2019ve got to get a note out, sure, I use my phone as much as anybody. But when it gets to something I\u2019ve got to be thinking through and editing and so forth, I think the world\u2019s maybe ready, especially in this era of mobile creativity. So many people creating on the fly. It\u2019s pretty inspiring.\n\nWatching my kids blows my mind. But even them, they have to move to their Surface. And I just think, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get to that next spot?\u201d I think this product does that.\n\nNP: I\u2019m very interested to see a form factor changes come because I think everything changes in that moment.\n\nYeah. I think we\u2019ve been waiting for it. I think we\u2019ve been waiting for it a little bit. And I think we\u2019ve been saying for a long time, when the form factor is ready to change, we\u2019ll be there. I think this is the time.\n\nNP: Panos, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nIt was fun.
