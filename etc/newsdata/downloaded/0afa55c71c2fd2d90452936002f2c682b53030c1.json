Given the \u201cstark and urgent warnings\u201d the inspector general for the intelligence community has delivered to Congress, Cummings said, the panel has \u201cno choice but to issue this subpoena.\u201d\n\nThe subpoena is directed toward acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. It requests 13 separate batches of documents related to a July phone call that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and related matters. The Oversight panel will issue the subpoena in coordination with the House intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees, Cummings said.\n\nThe action came as House and Senate staff prepared to meet with the State Department\u2019s inspector general on Wednesday. A State Department invitation to the meeting, which was reviewed by The Associated Press, requested an \u201curgent\u201d meeting with staff from eight House and Senate panels.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He said that as America\u2019s chief diplomat he is well-versed in U.S. policy toward Ukraine. But Pompeo continued to push back against what he said was Democrats\u2019 \u201cbullying and intimidation.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has set a defiant tone, resisting Congress\u2019 access to witnesses, even as House Democrats warn such efforts themselves could amount to an impeachable offense.\n\nDemocrats have scheduled closed-door depositions Thursday with former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and next week with ousted U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Rep.
