Get caught up and ready to get on with the weekend, because it\u2019s hard keeping pace in a digital traffic jam.\n\nHere\u2019s what you missed while you were away.\n\nEV regulations prompt Tesla to release fart noise feature\n\nU.S. authorities recently implemented regulations stating all electric vehicles travelling under 30 km/h must make some sort of noise to help pedestrians identify there\u2019s a massive chunk of metal moving nearby. Now, over in Europe, that \u201cnoise\u201d is by law supposed to sound basically like a traditional car. Boring!\n\nIn America, however, automakers were allowed to get a little more creative, and Elon Musk seemed to take that as a challenge. He recently Tweet-announced that Teslas will soon come with the ability to emit all sorts of clever sounds, from a cute little goat\u2019s bleat to the clip-clop of coconuts to one of the all-time greatest sound effects: the fart.\n\nWinter tire deadline change prompts CAA-Quebec\u2019s Winter Tire Appointment Week push\n\nAfter the legal deadline for winter tires was bumped up to December 1 this year, the Quebec division of CAA took it upon itself to remind residents what that means. You\u2019ve got to, um, change your tires to winters. OK?\n\nWinter Tire Appointment Week is indeed a real thing, and probably a good thing, too, even if incredibly dull-sounding. Because with 5.2 million passenger vehicles on Quebec\u2019s roads and less than two months to go before the big day, there\u2019s no time like the present to call your tire shop. Besides, how else are you going to celebrate Winter Tire Appointment Week?\n\nStriking U.S. auto union calls for end to imports, including Canada\u2019s\n\nThe United Automobile Workers has been on strike against General Motors for almost a month and are now calling for the company to put a stop to the import of all cars from foreign assembly plants, including those in Canada and Mexico. Union reps also apparently expressing qualms about the move toward automation and electric power. Negotiation talks are ongoing, but this recent argument isn\u2019t great news for GM\u2019s Oshawa plant, which was recently made the beneficiary of a $170-million injection from GM.\n\n2020 Subaru Crosstrek\u2019s $100 price bump earns it a stack of perks\n\nIt\u2019ll cost a bit more to get into Subaru\u2019s Crosstrek this year than it did last year, but if you\u2019re someone who needs to pile a little bit of everything on their buffet plate \u2013 not the Jello, for the love of God, not the Jello \u2013 then you might want to consider it.\n\nThe base 2020 Crosstrek starts at $23,795 and comes standard with a six-speed manual and all-wheel-drive, an Apple CarPlay/Android Auto-ready infotainment system, plus the brand\u2019s EyeSight driver-assist system and X-Mode\u2019s torque-splitting features in the CVT models. Now you can spend that $100 on something important, like that diet coach you obviously need.\n\nCanadian drivers sue Kia over alleged service schedule hoodwink\n\nEveryone knows there\u2019s no better way to care for a car than to follow exactly what it says in the owner\u2019s manual. Right? Apparently not if you drive a Kia and live in Canada. A class-action suit alleges Canadian drivers are being misled by Kia in terms of how often they\u2019re told to seek routine service. The book says 12,000 km, but if you live in Canada \u2013 most of it, anyway \u2013 the brand recommends a visit to the shop every 6,000 km. It\u2019s just too bad you can\u2019t sue winter.", "description": "Read Elon\u2019s Tweet-announcement about Tesla farts, the auto union\u2019s latest demands and why Canadian Kia drivers are suing", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/model-s-001.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
