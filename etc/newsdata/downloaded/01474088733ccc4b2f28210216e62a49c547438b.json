Instead of an hour-long newsmagazine, CBS News will launch \u201c60 in 6,\u201d which will condense original news stories into 6-minute long episodes, designed for consumption on mobile devices.\n\nThe deal will see 60 Minutes producing one original story per week, as part of Quibi\u2019s licensing agreement.\n\n\u201cThis is a perfect opportunity to bring 60 Minutes\u2019 style of storytelling, in-depth reporting, and investigative journalism to a new audience,\u201d said 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens, in a statement. \u201cWe are excited to launch \u201960 In 6,\u2019 as our digital footprint is more important than ever,\u201d he said.\n\nCBS isn\u2019t the first news partner coming to the upcoming streaming service. NBC will build out a full production team exclusively for its Quibi programming, which will include a 6-minute morning and evening news show for the service. The BBC and Quibi, meanwhile, are developing an international news show for millennials, that\u2019s five minutes in length. And ESPN just agreed to do a sports highlights and news show.\n\n\u201c60 Minutes has been, is, and will continue to be the gold standard of storytelling news journalism,\u201d added Jeffrey Katzenberg, Quibi founder and chairman of the board, in a statement. \u201cBringing their talent and resources to a new form of storytelling could not be more exciting for us at Quibi,\u201d he said.\n\nNews programming is only one aspect to Quibi, which will also include a variety of entertainment offerings from big-name talent, like Sam Raimi, Guillermo del Toro, Antoine Fuqua, and producer Jason Blum, among others. Quibi will also feature a show about Snapchat\u2019s founding, an action-thriller starring Liam Hemsworth, a murder mystery comedy from SNL\u2019s Lorne Michaels, a beauty docuseries from Tyra Banks, a Steven Spielberg horror show, a comedy from Thomas Lennon, a car-stunt series with Idris Elba, a comedy series from Trevor Noah, a drama with Queen Latifah, a thriller with Sophie Turner, and more.\n\nQuibi\u2019s premise is taking premium content and chopping it up into \u201cquick bites\u201d (hence the name), and delivering it to mobile viewers in both horizontal and vertical formats. The idea, essentially, is to build a Netflix for the Snapchat generation. This is a risky endeavor, given that the targeted demographic \u2014 Gen\u2019s Y and Z \u2014 is quite happy with their Netflix subscriptions for higher-production value entertainment, and with YouTube for more casual video viewing from the creator community.\n\nQuibi also seems to ignore the fact that most subscription-based video is still watched on TVs, not mobile devices. Meanwhile, on users\u2019 phones, Quibi will have to compete with a range of other apps and games \u2014 including the new titles from Apple Arcade \u2014 as well as other time fillers, like YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat.\n\nThat said, having Katzenberg at the helm has brought a lot of industry support to Quibi. The company has raised $1 billion from Disney, WarnerMedia, 21st Century Fox and others, and was looking to raise more. It also said this summer it had booked $100 million in ad sales pre-launch.\n\nQuibi will launch in April 2020, and \u201c60 in 6\u201d will be available at that time. The service will cost $5 per month, or $8 to go ad-free.", "description": "Jeffrey Katzenberg\u2019s streaming service Quibi, due to launch in April, has partnered with CBS News to modernize \u201c60 Minutes\u201d-style programming for the era of bite-sized video.
