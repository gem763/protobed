(AP) - Akshay Bhatia makes his professional debut in the Sanderson Farms Championship at age 17, and the prospect of winning didn\u2019t seem as overwhelming when he came across a player only three years older.\n\nIt was Joaquin Niemann, the 20-year-old from Chile, who won the PGA Tour\u2019s season opener last week at The Greenbrier.\n\n\u201cIt was really cool because Joaquin didn\u2019t go to college, and obviously had a great amateur and junior career,\u201d Bhatia said Wednesday. \u201cTo see him finally break through and win, it was probably the coolest thing. I saw him in the locker room this week, gave him a hug. It was just probably the coolest thing. Like I said, it\u2019s inspiring to see that. I\u2019m ready to get it going and see what I can do.\u201d\n\nThere are a few other differences.\n\nNiemann won the Latin American Amateur in 2017, played in the Masters and then earned his PGA Tour card through sponsor exemptions. Even though he\u2019s 20, this is his third season playing the PGA Tour.\n\nBhatia, who never had any intention of going to college, played in the Valspar Championship in March and missed the cut. He got into a Korn Ferry Tour event a month later and tied for 42nd. His experience isn\u2019t quite the same.\n\nEven so, youth is all the rage recently.\n\nAlong with Niemann winning last week, Matthew Wolff won a month after leaving Oklahoma State at the 3M Open in Minnesota. Then, Cal graduate Collin Morikawa won the Barracuda Championship. Sungjae Im, the 21-year-old from South Korea, was voted PGA Tour rookie of the year.\n\nThe defending champion at the Sanderson Farms, which starts Thursday, is Cameron Champ, who was 23 last year when he overpowered the course.\n\n\u201cI do definitely gain some confidence knowing that we\u2019re all good enough to compete out here,\u201d Bhatia said. \u201cIt\u2019s just getting over the hump of just the atmosphere is a little different. Obviously, we\u2019re all good golfers and we can put the ball in the hole really quick. I mean, these guys just have a little more experience. It\u2019s exciting seeing all these guys do so well so quick.\u201d\n\nBhatia will be facing a much stronger field than in recent years at the Country Club of Jackson when the Sanderson Farms begins Thursday. The tournament is no longer held the same week as the World Golf Championships event in Shanghai. That means it gets a full allotment of FedEx Cup points, and the winner gets an invitation to the Masters. The prize money has increased to $6.6 million.\n\nThat still didn\u2019t attract any of the top players. Many are at Wentworth outside London this week for the European Tour\u2019s flagship event, a list that includes Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Francesco Molinari and Tony Finau. Others, like Justin Thomas and Brooks Koepka, will not start their seasons until the next few weeks.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that players aren\u2019t just sitting around for the rest of the year.\n\n\u201cThe fall schedule has actually taken a more and more important kind of role over the last three or four years,\u201d said Brandt Snedeker, the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 41. \u201cIt used to be when they first started this fall schedule, you could take the whole fall off and start in January and it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal. Now you start in January and you are so far behind the 8-ball because there\u2019s so many tournaments - so many big tournaments in the fall - that you\u2019re kind of forced into playing a lot more.\u201d\n\nNiemann is still trying to come down from the biggest day of his career. He won by six shots, earned a return trip to the Masters and reached No. 50 in the world. He is the youngest international player to win on the PGA Tour since Harry \u201cLighthorse\u201d Cooper of England in 1923.\n\nIt\u2019s still sinking in. He still hasn\u2019t replied to all the phone calls and text messages, many of them from his native Chile. Suddenly, he is on the radar as a possible captain\u2019s pick for the Presidents Cup. Niemann\u2019s goal now is to act like it never happened.\n\n\u201cI just think that I just need to keep playing, just feel like I didn\u2019t win so I just keep pushing and try to get better every time,\u201d he said. \u201cJust happy to get that win, and keep practicing and enjoying everything.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Akshay Bhatia makes his professional debut in the Sanderson Farms Championship at age 17, and the prospect of winning didn't seem as overwhelming when he came across a player only three years older.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
