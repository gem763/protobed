The app uses built-in optical character recognition and Adobe Sensei technology, scanning your phone for receipts, forms, pictures, and business cards. The app can then turn them into searchable PDFs that can be shared. Adobe Scan also works with Acrobat, and you can add comments, signatures, and also export them to Microsoft Office.\n\nThe app also lets you find files by searching by name or date. If you\u2019re using an iPhone or iPad, the Adobe Scan files can also be accessed through iOS 11\u2019s Files app. If you\u2019re on Android, you can also access the scans when offline. Adobe claims it\u2019s also improved image cleaning in the app, so scans of documents that have folds will look clearer. If you\u2019re subscribed to Adobe\u2019s Document Cloud, you can also edit and organize documents, and digitally sign and send documents from any device.\n\nThe app is available for free on both iOS and Android. Adobe has also previously revealed prototype AI tools that let you instantly edit photos and videos.", "description": "You can then turn them into PDFs", "authors": ["Thuy Ong", "Nov"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NnBHfqaU1NWAWvsssB5jHKjezJI=/0x262:3654x2175/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9667769/Scan_Android.jpg", "published_at": "2017-11-14"}
