British Summer Time ended at 2am", "language": "en", "text": "Clocks went back last night as British Summer Time finally came to an end.\n\nThe nation got an extra hour in bed as they adjusted to the clocks moving back, which should now show up as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) rather than British Summer Time (BST).\n\nThe clock change, which has always fallen on the last Sunday of October, meant a long Sunday morning lie-in for Britain on October 28.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nAt 2am last night (Sunday October 29) the time in the UK will go back to being 1am as Greenwich Mean Time replaces British Summer Time\n\nBy moving our clocks forward in the summer every year, in a tradition marked with the Summer Time Act 1916, farmers and workers are given another hour of daylight to work, and output would be increased.\n\nOriginally, this was to contribute towards the war effort, since there was more light in the evenings.\n\nIt had been discussed for a number of years beforehand by the Government but many people opposed it the first time around.\n\nA man called William Willett wrote a whole pamphlet about it in 1907 called 'The Waste of Daylight' about how people wasted valuable hours of light during the summer.\n\nFounding Father of the United States Benjamin Franklin first had the idea to change the clocks while he was in Paris in 1784\n\nHe was also a keen golfer and would become rather annoyed when it got too dark for him to continue playing in the evening.\n\nSadly he died in 1915, a year before it was introduced in the UK.\n\nWhen the clocks went back last night, Britain reverted to Greenwich Mean Time.\n\nHowever, night workers may have had to work an extra hour, and those working on Sunday morning may have got confused with the time.", "description": "The nation got an extra hour in bed as they adjusted to the clocks moving back at 2am, which should now show up as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) rather than British Summer Time (BST).", "authors": ["Joseph Laws For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20231064-0-image-a-11_1572136914587.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
