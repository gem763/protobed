The call took place in July, but the date on the letter and who it was sent to are raising questions.\n\n?? ??IMPT question - when did Adam Schiff have access to the complaint or any related information? The letter to Schiff and Burr was dated August 12th. Did Schiff have ANY access earlier than Committee & if yes, why did he not immediately share this with his Committee? ???? \u2014 Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) September 27, 2019\n\nThe complaint is in fact dated August 12. It was sent to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff in addition to Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr. The news of the complaint didn't break until last weekend.\n\nTwo weeks ago and just before this news broke, the Department of Justice Inspector General announced he has completed the investigation in FISA abuse and the origins of the Russia investigation. I'm sure the timing is coincidental.\n\nBreaking***\n\nAttorney General Barr has received the draft report from the IG on allegations of FISA abuses and will begin the process of reviewing it, according to a source familiar with the situation. \u2014 Jake Gibson (@JakeBGibson) September 13, 2019\n\nIn the meantime, President Trump has called on Schiff to resign and be investigated.", "description": ".09/27/2019 20:59:25PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/142/b8fe6c22-ef85-4a7c-ab88-fa9282726626.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
