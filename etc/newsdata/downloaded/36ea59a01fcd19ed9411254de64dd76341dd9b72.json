As they try to add market exposure when the market trends upward, they produce more buying pressure and help to create more market strength.\n\nThe current Wall of Worry is a bit different than what we normally see, though. This time it is primarily a function of skepticism about obvious positives -- the Fed and a U.S.-China trade deal.\n\nThe bears have created a narrative that neither the Fed nor a deal with China can save the market from an impending recession. The argument is that progress with China is exaggerated and that nothing will happen in the near term. The argument in regard to the Fed is that interest rates are already so low that further rate cuts will have no significant market impact.\n\nThose arguments are what keeps the bears looking for sudden disaster. When there is another positive headline and the indices move up, many of them are forced to cover and underinvested bulls add long exposure. They still are worried about those negative narratives but when nothing negative happens the market keeps climbing higher and that strength leads to more buying and more strength.\n\nThe basic problem is that many market players focus more on fundamental arguments than on price action. The formulation of a market thesis can be important but what is far more important is the timing. Just because a negative argument makes sense there is no way to know when it will be embraced.\n\nIf you are on the wrong side of the action then there is a tendency to keep making adjustments to lessen the pain while waiting to be proven correct. Every day there is more pressure to relent and that is what causes the market to climb the Wall of Worry like it is doing this morning.\n\nAs we wind up the week, market players will be strategizing for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Sept. 17-18, which will result in the announcement of interest-rate policy next Wednesday afternoon. A quarter-point cut is deemed a near certainty but the wild card will be hints about how many more cuts may be coming.\n\nThe market has a tendency to celebrate Fed dovishness even when it is well anticipated. A \"sell the news\" reaction often seems like the logical outcome but maybe it is too logical, which lessens the tendency for it to work.\n\nFriday morning, the Wall of Worry combined with some more positives on China trade and hopes for a dovish Fed are driving the action. The bears are convinced that the folks that are buying for these reasons are foolish and will be punished but the fear of being left behind is more powerful than that argument.\n\nI'll be looking for some new buys and will try to not let the big-picture arguments blind me to the price action. We have a positive open on the way and upbeat sentiment.", "description": "The Wall of Worry combined with some more positives on China trade and hopes for a dovish Fed are driving the action.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Just Another Brick In The Wall Of Worry", "The Fear Of Being Left Behind Is More Powerful Than The Bears' Argument.", "Timothy Collins", "Jim Collins", "Alex Frew Mcmillan", "Carolyn Boroden", "Real Money", "Paul Price"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/c50d8d5d-cb03-11e8-ade1-b5ef3e6aac3a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
