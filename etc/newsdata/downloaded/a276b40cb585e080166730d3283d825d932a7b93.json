(Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photo: Matt Miller for the Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nA federal appeals court on Friday revived a lawsuit against Fox News brought by the parents of slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, concluding there are plausible claims that the conservative cable network was party to a \u201ccampaign of emotional torture.\u201d\n\nThe long-awaited opinion by a three-judge panel in New York, reversing a lower court ruling, opens the door for the lawyers representing Seth Rich\u2019s parents, Joel and Mary Rich, to obtain internal documents and depose top Fox News executives about a May 16, 2017, story falsely alleging that the DNC staff member had leaked internal party emails to WikiLeaks prior to his murder.\n\n\u201cWe would not wish what we have experienced upon any other parent \u2014 anywhere,\u201d Joel and Mary Rich said in a statement Friday they provided to Yahoo News. \u201cWe appreciate the appellate court\u2019s ruling and look forward to continuing to pursue justice.\u201d\n\nThe story in question, authored by Fox News staffer Malia Zimmerman, gave mainstream prominence to one of the most insidious conspiracy theories to arise out of the 2016 election. Suggesting that Rich\u2019s death was a political assassination, it was promoted at various times by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, President Trump\u2019s longtime political adviser Roger Stone and then White House senior adviser Steve Bannon.\n\nAsked for comment, a Fox News spokeswoman emailed a statement. \u201cThe court\u2019s ruling today permits Mr. and Mrs. Rich to proceed with discovery to determine whether there is a factual basis for their claims against FOX News,\u201d it said. \u201cAnd while we extend the Rich family our deepest condolences for their loss, we believe that discovery will demonstrate that FOX News did not engage in conduct that will support the Riches\u2019 claims. We will be evaluating our next legal steps.\u201d\n\nFox News coverage of the Seth Rich murder. More\n\nThe claims about Rich were the focus of the recent Yahoo News six-episode podcast \u201cConspiracyland.\u201d Rich, a 27-year-old DNC staffer from Omaha, was killed early on the morning of July 10, 2016, while walking home to his group house 30 blocks north of the Capitol in what Washington, D.C. police quickly concluded was a botched robbery. His assailants have never been caught and the police investigation into his death remains open.\n\nBut the \u201cConspiracyland\u201d series revealed that, just three days after his death, Russian intelligence agents had planted a conspiracy theory alleging Rich was gunned down by assassins working for Hillary Clinton.\n\nFrom there, stories about Rich quickly migrated to various far-right websites and eventually to Fox News, where for an eight-day period in 2017, the network\u2019s biggest names, led by primetime host Sean Hannity, played up the claim that he was the source for WikiLeaks, insisting that it undercut the official conclusion of U.S. government officials that Russian intelligence officials had hacked the DNC and then provided the emails through \u201ccut-outs,\u201d or intermediaries, to WikiLeaks.\n\nIn fact, no evidence ever surfaced of any connection between Rich and WikiLeaks and, in the \u201cConspiracyland\u201d podcast, Deborah Sines, the former assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the investigation into Rich\u2019s death, said on tape that the Fox News story was a \u201ccomplete fabrication.\u201d\n\nWriting for a unanimous three-member panel, U.S. Judge Calabresi flatly labeled the Fox News story a \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d account that was contradicted by \u201cofficial U.S. intelligence reports\u201d and was retracted by the network eight days after it was published.\n\nBut Calabresi noted that, even after it was retracted, Fox News guests continued to reference the article for months, while the network continued to make two videos available online that referred to its contents.\n\nIn stinging language, Calabresi wrote that the allegations brought by the Riches in their lawsuit against Fox News and two co-defendants, Zimmerman and Dallas moneyman Ed Butowsky, who was integrally involved in the preparation of the story, met the standard of \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d that should allow the Riches lawsuit to go forward.", "description": "The long-awaited opinion by a three-judge panel in New York, reversing a lower court ruling, opens the door for the lawyers representing Seth Rich\u2019s parents, Joel and Mary Rich, to obtain internal documents and depose top Fox News executives about a May 16, 2017, story falsely alleging that the DNC staff", "authors": ["Michael Isikoff", "Chief Investigative Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r.aEESJLLUxNUyNUc09EKg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/047f66a0-d640-11e9-aeff-006426509d40", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
