I am sure you understand this is unacceptable. My mandate is clear: safeguarding peace and stability in Ireland and protecting the integrity of the single market,\" Mr Barnier said after meeting Germany's foreign minister in Berlin on Monday.\n\n\u201cBased on current UK thinking it is difficult to see how we can arrive at a legally operative solution which fulfils all the objectives of the backstop. It is in a very sensitive and difficult phase.\u201d\n\nThe UK proposals, which have not yet been fleshed out beyond \"concepts\", involve Northern Ireland being aligned with the EU on some rules such as agriculture, known as SPS \u2013 but only with the say-so of the Stormont assembly. Northern Ireland would also remain part of a single Ireland electricity market.\n\nBut in other areas, such as manufactured goods and industrial goods, various \"facilitations\" would be employed so that there were checks and controls for products moving between Ireland and Northern Ireland, but they were carried out away from the border.\n\nBut EU officials said last week that the plans almost resembled the kind of thinking proposed by British negotiators during the early days of Theresa May's premiership \u2013 ideas they have long dismissed. They say the plans would not prevent checks and controls to the extent required to maintain the Northern Ireland peace process, and would also damage the integrity of the single market and facilitate smuggling.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I don\u2019t know how to inspect a cow with virtual methods.\u201d\n\nNotably, the withdrawal agreement agreed by Theresa May which includes the backstop already includes a clause that would allow the UK and EU to adopt \"alternative arrangements\" to the backstop if it can be proved that they exist. Brexiteers say the technology exists and that the backstop is therefore not needed; they fear that it will keep the UK in a customs union and prevent a free trade agreement with the US \u2013 a key goal of the right of the Conservative party.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He called for the UK to be given until the end of a transition period to work out an alternative backstop plan.\n\nEmmanuel Macron and the EU's Finnish presidency have said any concrete proposals from the UK need to be presented by the end of September or \"its over\". The bloc's leaders are set to meet in mid-October at a European Council summit in Brussels, the last such meeting before the UK is due to crash out without a deal.", "description": "It is \"difficult to see\" how a Brexit deal on the Irish border can be reached, the EU's chief negotiator has said.
