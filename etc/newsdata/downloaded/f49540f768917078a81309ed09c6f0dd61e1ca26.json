In the heat and altitude of Colorado, in the humidity of Okinawa, the pace has been so high that Joe Taufete\u2019e, the biggest hooker in world rugby, has ended up a little less big.\n\n\u201cWhen I got into camp in July,\u201d he says, down the phone, \u201cI had put on a little weight. I was almost 130kg. Now I\u2019m sitting at 120 so you can see the amount of work we\u2019ve put in. It\u2019s been horrendously tough.\u201d\n\nRugby World Cup 2019: USA team guide Read more\n\nHe\u2019s not exaggerating. One morning in Colorado, he says, \u201cWe did this notorious climb, the Incline.\u201d\n\nHe can\u2019t remember the number of steps up the side of a mountain in Manitou Springs \u2013 it\u2019s 2,744 \u2013 because he was \u201ctoo busy trying to find my breath. My soul got tested out there. It was more than 1k in uphill steps and after that we went on with this captain from the US military. You know how they carry big luggages in the army, about 30lbs? We went on like a 6k walk with that, and he kept the pace.\n\n\u201cIt was just horrendous, with the altitude as well. That\u2019s not what our bodies are used to.\u201d\n\nGold\u2019s point was that his men\u2019s bodies are not used to the rigors of regular Tests against genuine World Cup contenders. In Japan, they play three in a row.\n\nThe Eagles are all pros now, thanks to overseas clubs, the sevens circuit and the advent of Major League Rugby. They have a firm hold on Canada and they have risen to No13 in the world via historic results including a win over Scotland last year. But this will be different. France and Argentina follow England before Tonga offer perhaps the only realistic chance of a win.\n\nWe know it\u2019s going to take a lot of endurance to keep up with these guys but we\u2019re going to have something for them\n\nTaufete\u2019e insists the Eagles aim to win every game they play but concedes that \u201clooking at how England have been going, it\u2019s not going to be an easy battle. But we fully trust in what Gary does and we believe he\u2019s found a way into their DNA, and a way to try to exploit that. We know it\u2019s going to take a lot of endurance to keep up with these guys but I know we\u2019re going to have something for them.\u201d\n\nGold has extensive Premiership experience. So does Taufete\u2019e, who has been at Worcester since 2016. He speaks glowingly of the set-up at Sixways, of living in Cheltenham, of wanting to stay in England for a while to come.\n\nHe has described elsewhere how his wife, Noeleen, was responsible for his discovery of rugby. Taufete\u2019e was born in American Samoa and raised in the San Francisco Bay area and was a defensive tackle in college football. Injury wrecked his NFL dreams but Noeleen\u2019s family were stalwarts of Belmont Shore, one of the strongest rugby clubs in California and indeed the whole US. Partly in hope of impressing his date, Taufete\u2019e picked up the other odd-shaped ball. It worked out.\n\nWhat\u2019s less known is the impact on Taufete\u2019e of a season in New Zealand, an experience which propelled him towards making a living from rugby and now, still just 26, going to a second World Cup.\n\n\u201cIt was through Belmont Shore, our president-slash-CEO. I don\u2019t really know what his position is. Doug Pye. He\u2019s just the guy who runs the club, you know? He had connections in Otorohanga, in Waikato, he had family there, and so after a promising year I had, the club asked if I wanted to go overseas and expand my horizons through rugby.\n\n\u201cWhen I got there, you literally walk one mile from the entrance to the exit and that\u2019s the whole town of Otorohanga. But they were just lovely people and I couldn\u2019t believe I was there. I had family in New Zealand, in the Northland, so I was able to see them from time to time too.\u201d\n\nWhen I came back from New Zealand, I saw the game differently \u2026 I saw the field as a Kiwi would\n\nTaufete\u2019e spent six months amid the flying backs and fierce rucks of Kiwi club rugby, learning the game anew, \u201cplaying with some of the guys that played for the Blues, you know, and who played for Waikato\u201d. It all helped him become a mobile mountain of a hooker who has also won caps at prop.\n\n\u201cI kid you not,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I came back from New Zealand, I saw the game differently. I think that was the year that I really took off \u2026 everything just opened up. I saw the field better, I saw the field as a Kiwi would.\u201d\n\nIf Otorohanga was a finishing school, it was old school. Taufete\u2019e worked his passage \u201cat a timber company that was owned by the owner of the club, and I stayed with him too. He was a great man, Graham Wilshier was his name, and he also took in a guy from Argentina way back who\u2019s never left the side. He\u2019s kinda become his other son. You can see the hospitality he brings. It was just a lovely time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Taufete\u2019e celebrates after scoring his side\u2019s first try against Ireland in Dublin last year.

It was surreal to meet up with him there, knowing that I looked up to him when I was playing for Otorohanga and he was up in Super Rugby, coming back to the club for game time. When he showed up, I was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, the man plays for the Blues and he\u2019s next to me, playing.\u2019 It was amazing.\u201d\n\nTaufete\u2019e says he had similar thoughts when he was first an Eagle, called up for the 2015 World Cup, training and playing with the likes of Samu Manoa. Just four years later he\u2019s the hooker with the most tries in Test rugby, having passed the great Keith Wood with a hat-trick against Uruguay in March. Less-experienced Eagles, even hard-bitten pros like the Irish-born New York hooker Dylan \u201cThe Butcher\u201d Fawsitt, now look up to him.\n\n'Play 'em tough': Al Charron on how Canada were nearly a world power \u2013 and what went wrong Read more\n\nHe\u2019s too modest to actually say that \u2013 he details a strong relationship with Fawsitt, his backup \u2013 but he undeniably has a lot to teach, off the field as well as on.\n\nThe timber yards of Waikato were not his only other employer. In 2016, Taufete\u2019e signed with the San Diego Breakers of PRO Rugby, the predecessor of MLR. But, he says, \u201cwith the struggles it had as a new company and league, it wasn\u2019t stable enough for me to pursue it full-time. So I was working security with a hotel and driving to San Diego as often as I could.\u201d\n\nMLR and sevens do not pay big bucks either. Many in Gold\u2019s squad must make ends meet. As Taufete\u2019e focuses on the challenge in Japan, he sees his own past toils as a positive. After all, the hotel job was a step up on what he\u2019d done before, in a whole other school of hard knocks.\n\n\u201cI mean, it was safe,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI used to bounce a lot in LA and Orange County. That nightlife was too much even for me.\u201d", "description": "The Worcester hooker is a try-scoring threat in an Eagles squad full of seasoned pros and determined to mount a challenge in Japan", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d330b3a73a3e64b8b3a7606768bc8d8192c2e21/257_157_3850_2309/master/3850.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=31f7abb0919b14042c709f4951a5d151", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
