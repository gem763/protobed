This figure, a virginal loser whose only female contact comes from tenderly sponge-bathing his elderly shut-in mother, feels like he\u2019s been cheated by a world out of order. He exudes rage outward in every direction: to the girl next door failing to reciprocate his crush, to the absentee father leaving him without a role model, to the celebrity idol he worships until he ends up the butt of their joke. With nothing to lose and a heart full of hatred, the angry white man finally snaps, smearing on some face paint and going on a shocking rampage of gunfire. For all its extreme subject matter, this film has captured one particularly toxic dimension of the national attitude, a vitally relevant work of popular art for better and for worse.\n\nWhy so stupid: how Joker is too juvenile to be provocative Read more\n\nI am referring, of course, to Rob Lambert\u2019s new motion picture Cuck. What\u2019s that? They made another Joker movie?!\n\nThe similarities between Lambert\u2019s vision of alt-right virulence and Todd Phillips\u2019 much-discussed take on the famed foe of Batman are so numerous and specific that one would almost certainly seem like a rip-off of the other if the films hadn\u2019t been produced concurrently. They\u2019re joined in an objective to burrow into the pathologies of an extremist, to take a close look and discover what drives a seemingly ordinary person to extraordinary violence. Many critics have deemed Phillips\u2019 film a failure in its chosen creative mission, generally on charges of inadvertently glorifying the character it\u2019s supposed to be critiquing. What luck, then, that this week\u2019s cinematic offerings would also yield an illustrative counterexample to Joker\u2019s crucial missteps. Lambert\u2019s film makes its point by delving deeper into toxicity and committing to the most unattractive parts of itself. He\u2019s willing to put his money where mouth is, and the result is more repellent, honest and astute than this week\u2019s odds-on box office champion.\n\nOur man is Ronnie (Zachary Ray Sherman), a self-described \u201cpatriot\u201d disseminating racist invective from the computer room of his home in the California suburbs. Though he likes to wear his father\u2019s fatigues around town, he failed the military\u2019s psych exam and wouldn\u2019t get far with his doughy physique even if he passed. He subsists on a daily diet of vlog rants stoking the fires of misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia and every other strain of bigotry one could think up. Ronnie\u2019s taken to recording some of his own, going on awkward and inarticulate tirades laced with buzzwords native to his adopted peer group. Everyone\u2019s either a \u201ccuck\u201d, a \u201clibtard\u201d or worse.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing even faintly sympathetic about Ronnie. Every time it looks like the film might be showing some compassion toward his loneliness, he turns around and does something vile to remind us that his plight is almost entirely of his own creation. He\u2019s most likely diagnosable, and yet Lambert recognizes that mental illness isn\u2019t the real culprit here, but rather one element of a volatile combination. However Ronnie may be mixed-up in the head, his decisions and surroundings exacerbate and amplify his dark lines of thinking, creating a feedback loop in which his alienation from the world compounds itself every time he tries to make a connection. Lambert plays up the \u201cincel\u201d angle, first when Ronnie\u2019s attempt to chat up a stranger spirals out into calling her a bitch, and again when he falls in with his neighbors. They make cuckold pornography, and in Ronnie, they think they\u2019ve found the perfect guy to play the husband watching helplessly as a superior man goes to town on his \u201cwife\u201d.\n\nDuring these scenes, in which the couple seems needlessly cruel and antagonistic enough to justify Ronnie\u2019s eventual animosity towards them, Lambert overplays his hand. It seems for a moment like the world really is conspiring against Ronnie, when in actuality, he\u2019s merely cast himself as a tragic hero while playing the fool. The director and co-writer Joe Varkle are sharp about the black comedy that necessarily, uncomfortably coexists with this strain of dim-witted terrorism; a meeting to restore white supremacist values in America takes place at a TGI Friday\u2019s-style family restaurant, and ends with its leader musing that he\u2019s been eyeing the chilli fries.\n\nThat much proves essential during the chilling finale, in which Ronnie takes up arms against the many enemies existing largely within his fevered imagination. He turns out to be a pretty bad shooter, between his piss-poor aim and lack of a tactical plan. He clumsily picks off the few people he has anything personal against, then realizes he has nothing left to do with all of his anger, so he kills himself by pulling a gun on the police cornering him. It\u2019s a coward\u2019s way out of facing the consequences, and a surprisingly potent corrective to the end of Joker, which finds Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s maniacal antihero having essentially gotten away with it as he continues to outrun the authorities chasing him.\n\nThe most indelible shots of each film speak volumes about their true belief in the content of their protagonists\u2019 souls. The definitive image of Joker finds Phoenix in full clown get-up, power-striding down the street in slow motion as he revels in all the chaos he\u2019s created, like a deranged perversion of the classic sequence from The Right Stuff. The most memorable bit of Cuck comes when Ronnie\u2019s at his lowest, peer-pressured into letting a performer ejaculate on his face as the camera keeps rolling. The former can\u2019t help but admire the character it claims to interrogate and dissect, and the latter ensures that that will never be possible. Lambert\u2019s film pulls no punches in its efforts the show who Ronnie really is \u2013 neither hero, nor martyr, nor object of pity. He\u2019s just loud, and small.", "description": "While Todd Phillips\u2019 vacuous DC origins tale fails to go beneath its grimy surface, low-budget drama Cuck offers a braver alternative", "authors": ["Charles Bramesco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28acc43c402e0194c7797c1e245c4c3a14733246/57_0_1273_764/master/1273.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd28f629444ae451d881adb1e80646a0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
