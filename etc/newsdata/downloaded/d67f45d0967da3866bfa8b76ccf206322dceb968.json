Players steer characters such as Mario, Wario and Toad as they race karts through Tokyo and other cities while laying traps for opponents.\n\nBringing the Mario Kart franchise to smartphones offers the Japanese firm a chance to reverse a run of lackluster releases including this year\u2019s Dr. Mario World, a reboot of a minor title which gamers criticized as unpolished. Since its 1992 launch, the Mario Kart series has sold tens of millions of units.\n\nBut Mario Kart Tour faces potential roadblocks of its own. It will initially lack a multiplayer option - which analysts expect to come later - and is likely to use an in-game payment system popular in Japan but which has been compared to gambling.\n\n\u201cThis is probably Nintendo\u2019s most critical mobile release in a long time, if not ever,\u201d said Serkan Toto, founder of game industry consultancy Kantan Games.\n\nExpectations among investors and gamers alike have been heightened for Mario Kart Tour because of the franchise\u2019s console success and due to the title\u2019s long development time, with the release date pushed back from early this year, Toto said.\n\nFor a graphic on Mario Kart, click the link: here\n\nYOU PLAY, YOU PAY\n\nA test version of the game developed with partner DeNA Co Ltd (2432.T) featured in-game payment mechanics including gacha where players pay to receive random rewards - such as rare drivers and karts.\n\nA mainstay of Japan\u2019s highest-grossing mobile titles, gacha has been criticized for encouraging impulsive spending.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge to apply Japanese-style gacha mechanics in the West,\u201d said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities, who sees Mario Kart Tour struggling to hold players\u2019 interest long enough to sustain in-game spending.\n\nIt also remains to be seen whether Nintendo will be able to square the use of gacha with its famous family-friendly image. The Japanese firm is known for cartoon-like games that eschew the realistic violence and gore found in Western rival titles.\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S-A ME, MARIO\u2019\n\nMario Kart\u2019s mobile outing is the latest title steered by the moustachioed plumber Mario, known for his exaggerated, Italian-accented English. Since his debut in the game Donkey Kong in 1981, Mario has become Nintendo\u2019s virtual face and a mark of quality for many of the industry\u2019s top-selling titles.\n\nDespite the rise of mobile gaming, Nintendo remains committed to developing its own hardware for its top titles.\n\n\u201cFor Nintendo, hardware and software are one,\u201d said analyst Hideki Yasuda at Ace Securities.\n\n\u201cIt sees smartphones as an optimal way for users to come into contact with its intellectual property and to connect to hardware sales,\u201d he said, adding that monetization of mobile games is a secondary goal.\n\nMario Kart Tour\u2019s release comes ahead of a number of games for Nintendo\u2019s hybrid home-handheld Switch console designed to appeal to more casual players, including two Pokemon titles in November and island life simulator Animal Crossing: New Horizons in March.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man stands in front of Nintendo's logo at the presentation ceremony of its new game console Switch in Tokyo, Japan, Jan. 13, 2017.
