He also warned Trump a thousand Islamic State prisoners were \u201crunning wild\u201d in Syria as a result of the conflict.\n\nKilmeade argued Trump should act in Syria to defend the Kurds, despite his campaign promise to get American troops out of the Middle East.\n\n\u201cGo with realities on the ground. Don\u2019t go with a campaign promise when the reality on the ground is ISIS is targeting us, Al Qaeda is targeting us,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey invaded Syria last week, allowing hundreds of ISIS supporters to escape in the chaos from a Kurdish camp in Syria, according to Kurdish officials.\n\nBut Trump indicated the ISIS prisoners were Europe\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cEurope had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn\u2019t want the cost,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe said the Kurds were likely releasing ISIS prisoners to get America engaged in their conflict.\n\n\u201cEasily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe threatened economic sanctions against Turkey for their offensive against the Kurds into Syria but did not signal interest in a military attack leading to another war.\n\n\u201cBig sanctions on Turkey coming!\u201d he wrote. \u201cDo people really think we should go to war with NATO Member Turkey? Never-ending wars will end!\u201d\n\nBut Kilmeade said that the threatened sanctions were \u201ctoo late\u201d to stop the damage against the Kurds in Syria.\n\nBrian Kilmeade over at @foxandfriends got it all wrong. We are not going into another war between people who have been fighting with each other for 200 years. Europe had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn\u2019t want the cost. \u201cLet the USA pay,\u201d they said\u2026 \u2014 Donald J.
