REUTERS/Tatyana Makeyeva\n\nMOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court sentenced two men to up to three and a half years in jail on Wednesday for using violence against police officers at a political protest calling for a free election on Sunday.\n\nThe jail terms, which the opposition said were clearly disproportionate, are among the longest to be handed down to protesters since Russia\u2019s biggest protests in years erupted this summer over a local election in the capital.\n\nProtesters wanted a slew of opposition-minded candidates to take part in the Sept. 8 vote for Moscow\u2019s legislature, but they were barred from doing so for failing to gather enough signatures of support, something the opposition said is a lie.\n\nPolice have briefly detained more than 2,000 people at the protests and opened criminal investigations. Two men were jailed on Tuesday for attacking police at one of the protests and became the first people who took part in the rallies to be given lengthy prison terms.\n\nOn Wednesday, courts convicted two more people, including Kirill Zhukov, 28, who was jailed for three years for hitting a police officer\u2019s helmet at a July 27 protest, charges he denied.\n\nHis supporters said the sentence was grossly unfair and that it was clear from footage of the incident that Zhukov had barely touched the policeman\u2019s helmet.\n\nHours later, another court in Moscow found 48-year-old protester Yevgeny Kovalenko guilty of the same crime and jailed him for three and a half years.\n\nKovalenko, who also denied the charges, was shown in footage circulated online throwing a rubbish bin towards police officers as they detained protesters at a protest.\n\nAround 60,000 people attended an authorised opposition rally on Aug. 10 in Moscow, which a monitoring group called the country\u2019s biggest political protest for eight years. But an unauthorised protest last weekend attracted only a few thousand.", "description": "A Russian court sentenced two men to up to three and a half years in jail on Wednesday for using violence against police officers at a political protest calling for a free election on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426170840&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831CE"}
