It sees the potential for rampant smuggling, especially as Johnson intends for the rest of the UK to diverge from EU labor, environmental and tax norms to aim for a regulation-lite economy on Europe's doorstep.\n\nNor does the EU agree with a proposal that Northern Ireland's assembly be given a right to effectively veto the post-Brexit customs arrangement.\n\nIf either of those two proposals are red lines for Johnson, it is hard to see the EU moving talks into the negotiation phase.\n\nYet if he bends on them, he risks losing tenuous support in the UK parliament to maybe pass a Brexit deal, reliant on 10 Democratic Unionist MPs from Northern Ireland and hard-core Brexit MPs in his Conservative Party.\n\nIf thwarted, Johnson's best bet may lie with early elections.\n\nThere he also faces a challenge, with the UK parliament having passed a law requiring him to seek a Brexit extension from the EU by Oct 19 if he has not reached a deal by then.\n\nBritish media speculated that Johnson might seek to sabotage any extension request he is forced to make against his will.\n\nOne path included his ministers asking an EU member state to block the unanimous approval needed for an extension, with Hungary cited as a likely ally to break EU ranks.\n\nBut Budapest denied Britain had approached it with such a request, and a Hungarian foreign ministry source told AFP: \"To date there is no request for a delay, hence there is no point in speculating about anything.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "EU and UK officials are to resume talks Monday on Britain's plans for a managed Brexit after a weekend hiatus during which London was under pressure to revise its proposals.
