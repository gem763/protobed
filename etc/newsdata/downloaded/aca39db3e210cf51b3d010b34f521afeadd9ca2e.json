(Altmaier broke his nose, but his ministry said he was \u201cdoing well.\u201d)\n\nThe snarky memes that filled social media in the hours that followed were just as predictable as the faux shock over the tasteless reactions. But what irked some of Altmaier\u2019s allies most of all was that in falling flat on his face, the minister unwittingly delivered the perfect metaphor for the dysfunction of Germany\u2019s dominant political party and the governing coalition it leads.\n\nTry as they might, Germany\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU) can\u2019t seem to get anything right of late. Whether debating gender-neutral restrooms or how to respond to the crisis in Syria, party leaders\u2019 main contribution to Germany\u2019s national conversation has been to serve as an inspiration for punchline writers.\n\nIt was a year ago this week that the center-right party began preparing for life after Angela Merkel. After the CDU got battered in a key regional election in Hesse, Merkel agreed to hand over control of the party to a successor and said she wouldn\u2019t pursue another term as chancellor.\n\n\u201cAs long as Merkel is chancellor, the leadership question will remain unresolved\" \u2014 A senior CDU official\n\nAbout a month later, the party elected Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel\u2019s hand-picked choice, to succeed her. Hopes that \u201cAKK,\u201d as Kramp-Karrenbauer is widely known, would manage to quickly restore unity to the party and energize its base soon dissipated, however.\n\nThat\u2019s largely because Merkel remains the de facto head of the party, her critics say. Even if she formally handed the reins of the party to Kramp-Karrenbauer, among Christian Democrats there\u2019s no question who\u2019s really in charge.\n\n\u201cAs long as Merkel is chancellor, the leadership question will remain unresolved,\u201d one senior CDU official said.\n\nAfter nearly 15 years as chancellor, Merkel has achieved a degree of political authority that Kramp-Karrenbauer as the former premier of Saarland, one of Germany\u2019s smallest states, simply can\u2019t match. In poll after poll, Merkel ranks as Germany\u2019s first- or second-most trusted politician. Meanwhile, two-thirds of Germans don't think Kramp-Karrenbauer is ready to be chancellor, according to a poll published this month.\n\nIn an effort to raise her profile, Kramp-Karrenbauer took over Germany\u2019s defense ministry in July from Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nIt\u2019s been rough going.\n\nWhile she drew praise for pushing through a plan to allow army personnel to travel on German trains for free, her bold suggestion last week that the German military should engage in Syria was widely panned, even by some senior officials in her own party.\n\nEven those in the CDU who want to see Germany look after its own security interests instead of relying almost solely on the U.S. were critical.\n\n\u201cShe has the right impulses, but the execution could have been much better,\u201d one CDU lawmaker said.\n\nThe episode has fueled doubts within the party over whether Kramp-Karrebauer is ready to step into Merkel\u2019s shoes.\n\nOther contenders are waiting in the wings.\n\nBoth Armin Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state, and Friedrich Merz, a CDU veteran who narrowly lost to Kramp-Karrenbauer in last year\u2019s leadership race, have been conspicuously present in German media and public fora of late, offering their views on the state of the CDU and the world.\n\nHealth Minister Jens Spahn, a favorite of the party\u2019s youth wing who also lost to Kramp-Karrenbauer, has also maintained a busy public schedule.\n\nThe uncertainty over the CDU\u2019s leadership is about much more than who leads the party.\n\nThe bigger question is what direction Germany\u2019s biggest political party will take, a decision that won\u2019t be taken until Merkel is gone.\n\nUnder Merkel, the CDU moved so far to the center on a host of social and cultural issues that many voters say they no longer know what it stands for. In her first months as party leader, Kramp-Karrenbauer sounded more conservative notes on migration and gender politics. But when the party\u2019s poll numbers began to slide, she reversed course.\n\nThat discursive messaging helps explain the CDU\u2019s poor showing in a string of recent elections, including the European election in May, where it lost nearly a quarter of its support.\n\nAfter the trials of Brexit and the EU\u2019s bungled Balkan expansion, another German faceplant is the last thing Europe needs.\n\nLast weekend in the eastern state of Thuringia, the CDU suffered even bigger losses, with its support by dropping by more than one-third. It fell from first place to third behind both the far-left Linke party, which placed first, and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nGrowing discord between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats (SPD), their reluctant partners in the federal coalition, has further complicated the center-right\u2019s crisis.\n\nThe SPD faces its own internal issues. Depending on who wins the party\u2019s upcoming leadership race, there\u2019s a fair chance it will decide by year-end to exit the coalition.\n\nThat might prompt the CDU to attempt a minority government until the end of the legislative term in 2021, either with or without Merkel. New elections are another possibility.\n\nNeither scenario is ideal. Not only is Germany set to take over the rotating Council of the EU presidency in July, there\u2019s also a good chance the EU budget will be finalized during its term.\n\nAfter the trials of Brexit and the EU\u2019s bungled Balkan expansion, another German faceplant is the last thing Europe needs.", "description": "The Christian Democrats can\u2019t get anything right.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Janosch Delcker", "Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-873592962-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
