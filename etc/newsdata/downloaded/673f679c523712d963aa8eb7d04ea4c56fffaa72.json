But it looks like that old standard definition of Washington: What\u2019s legal is really what\u2019s troubling to people,\" Kane said.\n\n\"So he got hired, got put on the board of this gas company, and as you said, if his name was Hunter Walker, would he have done so? So that doesn\u2019t look good in this moment of where Democrats, especially, are fighting back against sort of corporate interests,\" he added.\n\nKate Bedingfield, the deputy campaign manager and communications director for Biden's campaign, was asked by CNN on Monday if Biden regrets not telling Hunter to not take the job, if for no other reason than for the bad optics.\n\n\"No, because he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. And, you know, the White House said in 2014 that there was no issue with Hunter having that job,\" Bedingfield said.\n\n\"But, you know, and I think that asking this question is exactly, Alisyn, what Donald Trump wants, right? There\u2019s no evidence, as you stipulated at the top, which is important, there\u2019s no evidence that he did anything wrong, and yet he still hopes that you guys will ask questions like that, that you will try to insinuate that there was an optical issue, that there was some kind of, you know, that there\u2019s some kind of issue there that wasn\u2019t there,\" she added.", "description": ".10/01/2019 11:20:20AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/273/83113232-faa9-4ab6-a977-5f4fb2009b61.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
