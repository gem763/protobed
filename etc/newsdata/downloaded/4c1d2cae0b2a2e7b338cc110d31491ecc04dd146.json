Planning for divorce and taking steps to reduce one of its major causes is something every engaged and newly married couple should earnestly do to cover all the bases.\n\nEngaged couples spend countless hours planning their wedding and honeymoon. With two marriage-age children of my own, I hear many discussions about choosing a wedding planner, venue and dress. What I rarely hear are conversations around selecting a CPA or financial adviser, or developing a prenuptial agreement. Discussing and planning the couple\u2019s financial future is of paramount importance and should be prepared for accordingly.\n\nResearch shows that money issues are the second leading cause of divorce after infidelity. Having this \u201cmoney talk\u201d and setting financial ground rules before the couple says \u201cI do\u201d helps ensure they\u2019re on the same page regarding their financial goals and priorities. It also sets their economic future off on the right foot. Unfortunately, people seldom focus on finances when they get married; this lack of financial planning can lead to future problems and hefty professional fees.\n\nProviding proof with records\n\nIn the event of a divorce, each party may need to prove an asset, such as a bank or brokerage account, was acquired before marriage and thus separate property not subject to equitable distribution. Providing this proof can be extremely difficult unless the account holder has maintained complete records, including copies of monthly statements. Many people don\u2019t realize banks and brokerage firms are only required to keep records for seven years. Past that time, the onus of maintaining these records falls on the account holder. The quality of the record-keeping is usually the multimillion-dollar deal-maker or breaker.\n\nIn one case, a spouse we represented needed to prove a $16 million brokerage account was their separate property. This account was opened before the marriage in the early 1990s with a balance of about $500,000. Fortunately, our client had saved every brokerage statement and all the paperwork related to the investments, which enabled us to prove the account was separate property. Unfortunately, this level of record-keeping is rare.\n\nTo commingle or not to commingle?\n\nMeticulous record-keeping alone won\u2019t prove an asset is the spouse\u2019s separate property. They also need to prove the asset wasn\u2019t commingled with any marital assets. The commingling of separate property with marital assets generally makes it marital property subject to division upon divorce.\n\nFor example, if a spouse deposits their annual bonus earned after marriage into an account he or she had before the nuptials, the account would be considered a marital asset. Couples should open new accounts for their marital funds to avoid this situation. Another example of commingling is when one spouse uses marital funds to pay the mortgage, maintenance expenses and property taxes on a house bought before the marriage. As a result, the house becomes marital property. A pitfall that surprises many people has to do with account management. If the owner of a separate account actively manages it during the marriage, it becomes a marital account subject to equitable distribution\u2014an unpleasant and certainly not anticipated result. With minimal planning, adequate record-keeping, and basic account management, separate property can remain as such.\n\nIn addition to following the above basic rules, both spouses should be actively involved in the family finances, so they are aware of what\u2019s happening with their accounts. This involvement ensures one spouse is not mismanaging funds, transferring joint assets into their own name, or even fueling an addiction. Unfortunately, we see too many cases where it\u2019s only after a spouse is served with divorce papers that they discover all their assets have been wasted or hidden.\n\nSetting boundaries with a prenup\n\nWhen at least one party entering the marriage has substantial assets or expects to come into significant money after the wedding, establishing a prenuptial agreement should be an obvious choice. For example, a scientist working on the development of a new drug may want a prenup that states any future benefits from their work will remain their separate property, or their spouse is only entitled to a certain percentage.\n\nWhile not everyone falls into this category of having (or expecting to accrue) significant assets, every couple should explore signing a prenuptial agreement. In addition to protecting one spouse\u2019s assets, a prenuptial agreement can also be used to set clear financial boundaries and expectations. While there is a stigma surrounding prenuptial agreements, they really should be viewed as a contract between two loving parties. And like with any financial and legal subject, the sooner the couple starts this discussion, the better.\n\nWe recommend that couples work with a financial professional on their prenup to make the process more objective. Besides assets, prenuptial agreements should also address debt. Take the case of a young professional couple where one of them has significant student loans. A prenup could spell out how the debt would be serviced during the marriage and whether it would be a marital liability in a divorce.\n\nPrenups can also be used to address family heirlooms. Without a prenuptial agreement, divorcing couples can spend thousands of dollars in legal and professional fees to accomplish what could have been easily decided upon peacefully before the marriage.\n\nWhile not the most enjoyable topic to discuss while planning for a wedding, talking about the financial aspects of a potential divorce can save money and reduce future anguish. Marriage is one of the most significant financial decisions a person can make, and like any significant financial undertaking, it requires careful planning.\n\nOpen and honest conversations about money early on will help ensure the couple is clear about what each party is bringing to the marriage and their expectations for these assets. The discussion can also help them conduct a financial inventory and take precautions to protect separate assets and properties.\n\nUltimately, the hope is the couple will live happily ever after and not divorce. Taking these steps now will set them up for financial success for the rest of their lives.\n\nEkaterina Klimentova is a partner in the New York office of Cerity Partners and has over 20 years of experience in the financial services industry, providing a range of professional services including tax planning, consulting and compliance, as well as accounting, family office services, and divorce financial consulting.", "description": "Money issues are the second leading cause of divorce", "authors": ["Ekaterina Klimentova"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GQ429_cr_wed_ZG_20180920141553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
