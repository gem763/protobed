That is why the Northern Ireland backstop is flawed. Not one single unionist MLA in the Northern Ireland Assembly supports it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is undemocratic and unconstitutional and would place a tariff border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. That would be unacceptable. \"\n\nShe added: \"During today\u2019s meeting, the prime minister confirmed his rejection of the Northern Ireland only backstop and his commitment to securing a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland.\u201d\n\nHer comments came after Ireland's EU commissioner, Phil Hogan, said \"the penny is finally dropping\" in No10 on the need for the UK to compromise on the backstop.\n\nMr Hogan claimed that the EU had sensed a renewed willingness among UK ministers to consider a Northern Ireland-only solution.\n\nHe told The Irish Times: \u201cMr Johnson has made a proposal in the last few days talking about an all-Ireland food zone.\n\n\u201cThat is certainly a clear indication of divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU and the rest of the UK. This is the first time that this has been spoken about by a British prime minister where they are prepared to accept some level of divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.", "description": "Arlene Foster has warned Boris Johnson that any attempt to solve the Brexit crisis by limiting the controversial backstop to apply only to Northern Ireland would be \"doomed to failure\".
