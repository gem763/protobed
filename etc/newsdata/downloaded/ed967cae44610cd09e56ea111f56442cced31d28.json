A creature that does that much sleeping needs a comfortable place to catch those winks.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want them sleeping on your furniture all the time, or you just want to treat your cat to its own comfortable sleeping quarters, you\u2019ll need a cat bed. Cat beds come in a wide variety of styles, and you may need to try a couple to find the one your cat likes best. If you have a large house, consider getting a few of their favorite styles so they have a place to rest in more than one room.\n\nTo give your cat the best conditions for fitting in all those cat naps, consider our list of the best cat beds.", "description": "To give your cat the best conditions for fitting in all those cat naps, consider our list of the best cat beds.", "authors": ["Randall Tompkins"], "top_image": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/catbeds1.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "published_at": "2018-12-05"}
