And that just isn't fast enough to grow. We\u2019re already at full employment, basically.\u201d\n\nLast year, the U.S. economy grew by 2.5 percent, below the Trump administration's 3 percent target, and last month U.S. employers added 164,000 jobs while the unemployment rate remained near a 50-year-low at 3.7 percent, according to the Labor Department.\n\nKelly said only having two-tenths of a percent growth in the working age population is also what employment growth will be, which means \u201c3 percent [GDP] is a pipe dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe'll have a very hard time achieving 2 percent growth,\u201d he said. \u201cSo just over this next decade as the baby boom retires, one policy choice we ought to look at is increasing the number of immigrants to sort of fill the pothole here caused by the retirement of the baby [boomers].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nKelly said 75 percent of immigrants who enter the U.S. each year are of working age as compared to about 64 percent of the native population.\n\n\u201cWhen you bring in more immigrants, you disproportionately bring in more workers, and actually workers is what the United States will need over the next decade,\u201d he said.", "description": "'When you bring in more immigrants you disproportionately bring in more workers, and actually workers is what the United States will need over the next decade,' said David Kelly.", "authors": ["Julia Limitone"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/03/0/0/RTX2RK4G.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
