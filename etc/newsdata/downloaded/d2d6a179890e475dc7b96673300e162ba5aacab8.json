Officials are continuing talks in Brussels over the weekend after the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, gave the go-ahead for intensive negotiations to start.\n\nHowever, Morgan would not be drawn on details of the discussions because \u201cthere are subtle nuances with all of these things\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s a question of what is negotiated between the parties and obviously it also has to satisfy people living in Northern Ireland, who are very much at the heart of all of this, and to be approved by members of parliament.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Unionist party and the European Research Group of rightwing Conservatives issued statements promising flexibility, keeping hope alive that Johnson could find support for a new offer in the House of Commons.\n\nBut the prime minister faces a frantic race to push through a deal before 31 October. On Friday, Johnson twice refused to deny Northern Ireland could stay in the EU\u2019s customs territory after Brexit.\n\nDuring a briefing of EU ambassadors on Friday, Barnier did not go into the details of the UK\u2019s new position. But he informed the diplomats that his two-hour breakfast with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had been notable for the apparent pivot by the British government.\n\nOne EU source said: \u201cThe UK has accepted that there is not a deal that involves a border on the island of Ireland \u2013 that is a big break from what they were saying. Now the key is for them to lay out how their new position over the weekend.\u201d\n\nMorgan also said reports that Johnson was preparing to fight a general election on a no-deal platform if he were unable to get an agreement were \u201cwide of the mark\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe prime minister has always been clear that a deal is infinitely preferable and that is what we want to see.\n\n\u201cThese talks with our EU friends and neighbours are obviously at a very delicate stage. I think it is incumbent on all of us to stand back from briefings and speculation and just allow these talks to happen.\u201d", "description": "Minister voices hopes of progress after talks between UK and Ireland over border", "authors": ["Damien Gayle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a29f62d7a0fcddd8dc7a3dd16818f771b429437/0_1162_2845_1706/master/2845.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d1cb8866b521220cfbbf5f0f51118a6b", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
