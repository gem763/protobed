Remember the Sachin Tendulkar era? Anil Kumble sort of fell through the cracks because the Master Blaster hogged all the attention. Well, now in a different century, the same thing is happening.\n\nVirat Kohli is certainly the best batsman across formats right now and for India easily the batting mainstay. But what about our bowling? Well that credit goes to Ravichandran Ashwin. The man had 27 five-wicket hauls in 66 Tests. Now for a bowler s fifer has the same value as a hundred does for a batsmen. Kohli has 25 centuries in 80 games. So that puts Ashwin right up there as the Kohli of India's bowling.\n\nBCCI/Cricinfo\n\nFastest to 300 wickets, joint fastest to 350 scalps, second highest number of Test fifers for India and well on course to finish with over 600 wickets, Ashwin is a bowling machine who just loves to take wickets. What runs are to Kohli, wickets are to Ashwin.\n\nIn the first Test vs South Africa, he was back with a vengeance and took 7 wickets. When it comes to Test cricket, he is our premier bowler and also perhaps the best spinner in the world today. Ashwin has just turned 33, there are easily 5 years or so left for him. If he is consistent and fit during this period the 600-mark beckons.\n\nDon't Miss 320 SHARES 420 SHARES 190 SHARES 101 SHARES\n\nCricinfo\n\nThe man is 5th among the list of top active wicket takers. At the rate at which he's going, he may finish in the top 5 of the overall list. While the world record of 800 by Muttiah Muralitharan is a little beyond his reach, one can always hope.\n\nSouth Africa and the rest of the world need to be wary. Ashwin is on fire and he is spinning it with venom.", "description": "When it comes to Team India, the batting is highlighted so often that we tend to forget about bowlers.
