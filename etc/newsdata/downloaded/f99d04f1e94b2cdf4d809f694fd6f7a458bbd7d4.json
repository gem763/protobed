You assume the (Scotland-Japan) game goes ahead on Sunday and, if it doesn\u2019t, you cross that bridge when you come to it.\u201d\n\nAmong the various scenarios to decide the pool, if Ireland don\u2019t score four tries, they could finish the pool phase with only one loss but still be on an early flight home.\n\nBest said his green machine did not lack confidence, but needed a bit of polish after being too good for Scotland and Russia but suffering a shock loss to Japan.\n\n\u201cThe bits we did well were very typical of us. The bits we didn\u2019t do well\u2026 we didn\u2019t follow through with some of the fundamentals that we do really well when we\u2019re on top of our game,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at that, you take confidence you\u2019re in a good place, but you just need to execute better.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Business as usual\u2019 \u2013\n\nLike Pacific island neighbours Tonga and Fiji, Samoa are making an early exit but want to go out in style.\n\nCoach Steve Jackson said his team will take inspiration from Tonga, who pushed France to the limit in their final game, and Fiji, who did the same against Wales.\n\n\u201cIreland are in the top three teams in the world and we\u2019re just going there to throw everything at it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat better opportunity to finish the World Cup? Knowing that we\u2019re on an airplane on Monday, going home, to have a scalp like that would be great.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the Japan defeat, coach Joe Schmidt said it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for Ireland who will face South Africa in the quarter-finals if they win their pool or defending champions New Zealand if they are runners-up.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t control what happens with the Japan-Scotland game, so on Saturday it\u2019s up to us to get our business done as best we can,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure our game gets finished with the right result for us\u2026 Once you get to the ground and you know the immediacy of the match, it tends to be able to focus the mind.\u201d\n\nRobbie Henshaw will get his first game in the World Cup after recovering from a hamstring injury with Schmidt naming close to his best side to face Samoa.\n\nOnly Peter O\u2019Mahony, who is in the reserves, and Garry Ringrose, who is being rested after playing the first three games, are missing from the perceived top Ireland side.\n\nFly-half Johnny Sexton combines with long-time partner Conor Murray at nine while in the forwards, the versatile Tadhg Beirne moves from lock to the back row.\n\nThe tight five is predictably Cian Healy, Best, Tadhg Furlong, James Ryan and Iain Henderson.", "description": "Fukuoka (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Ireland skipper Rory Best is taking a philosophical approach to Saturday\u2019s critical clash with Samoa, keeping calm as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/b7f03f_ireland-bonus-point-win-on-saturday-ireland-calm-samoa-clash-rugby-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
