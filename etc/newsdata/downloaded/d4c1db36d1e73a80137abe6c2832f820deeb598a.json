Kale Kayihura's alleged offenses \"will be handled in Uganda.\"\n\nThe sanctions are widely seen in Uganda as sending a strong message to Museveni about alleged corruption and rights violations.\n\nMuseveni says his government will never hand any Ugandan to global justice mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court, even though his country is a state party to the statute creating the ICC.\n\nThe U.S. this month blocked Kayihura's assets and imposed a travel ban on him and family members, saying units under his command committed \"serious human rights abuses.\" He also is accused of corruption and bribery.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
