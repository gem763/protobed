It\u2019s a witch hunt. I\u2019m leading in the polls. They have no idea how they stop me, the only way they can try is through impeachment,\" Trump told reporters as he arrived at the United Nations ahead of his address to world leaders Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It\u2019s nonsense, and when you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you\u2019ll see at some point, you\u2019ll understand. That call was perfect,\" Trump added.\n\nDemocrats have raised alarm bells that Trump and his allies have solicited a foreign nation to investigate one of his political opponents after the president acknowledged that he spoke about the Bidens in the context of corruption during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he has denied there was anything improper about it.\n\nAdditional Democrats have come out in favor of impeachment following reports Monday night that Trump ordered millions of dollars in military aid for Ukraine be withheld just days before the call with Zelensky.\n\nThe president denied there was any explicit quid pro quo involving the aid and the investigation into the Bidens.\n\nTrump on Tuesday claimed that he withheld the funds because he wanted to see European nations like France and Germany contribute more to help Ukraine fend off Russian aggression, and he did not express any regret about his decision.\n\n\"Those funds were paid. They were fully paid but my complaint has always been \u2014 and I\u2019ll withhold again and I\u2019ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine. Because they're not doing it,\" he said.\n\nVideo: Trump confirms he withheld military aid from Ukraine before his call with Ukrainian President Zelensky\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/yajPreqy0H \u2014 Mike Walker (@New_Narrative) September 24, 2019\n\nTrump is scheduled to meet with Zelensky on Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.", "description": "President Trump on Tuesday scoffed at the\u00a0mounting calls for impeachment proceedings from House Democrats as he faces increasing scrutiny for his\u00a0interactions with Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpd_09242019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
