There's a paparazzi down the street. If a photograph got out with you with a ring on it, it would explode all over the world',\" said Pierce.", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex was warned by her Suits co-star that her life would be \"forever changed\" when she married into the Royal Family.", "authors": ["Phoebe Southworth", "Shane Watson", "Allison Pearson", "Camilla Tominey"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/royal-family/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000158944191-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0Q5PeULBLQOUfa_w0bw9lDk2VvW4b3un7VV69_WFKKM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
