Prepare what we\u2019re going to tell congressional investigators. And then, in the middle of the night, just hours before heading to Capitol Hill, the administration puts the kibosh on your appearance.\n\nDon\u2019t you remember when that happened to you?\n\nThe Trump administration blocked U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland from appearing before lawmakers to tell his side of the Ukraine story on Tuesday. A few hours later, the White House wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to declare her impeachment inquest \u201cinvalid.\u201d As a result, the administration won\u2019t permit any witnesses to testify and it won\u2019t fork over any documents related to the probe.\n\nEVER SINCE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WAS ANNOUNCED, IT'S BEEN GETTING CRAZIER OUT THERE\n\nThe House is on a recess this week. Some lawmakers who flew in just for the Sondland interview fumed about the cancellation early Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cThey told us it was going to happen an hour ago,\u201d vented one House member, expecting to attend the interview early Tuesday morning. \u201cI canceled all sorts of district and constituent events for this.\u201d\n\nIn the TV news business, we often toss in a throwaway line during a live shot. We declare we \u201cdon\u2019t know what will happen next,\u201d or some other bromide. But in this impeachment process, we truly don\u2019t know how this will unfold. We\u2019re in such new territory here.\n\nBut one thing is clear: The decision by the Trump administration to bar any cooperation with Congress simply hastened the impeachment timetable.\n\nWhen Pelosi formally threw her support behind the impeachment probe last month, she was vague about a concrete deadline to resolve the matter. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., noted, \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to drag on for months and months, which appears to be the administration\u2019s strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want this to drag on for months and months, which appears to be the administration\u2019s strategy.\u201d \u2014 U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\n\nIt was thought as recently as last weekend that the House could burn a couple of months investigating the Ukraine issue -- and then turn to crafting articles of impeachment. But the lack of compliance poured accelerant on the entire process. If House Democrats don\u2019t get the materials they want soon, it\u2019s not outside the question the House could expedite articles of impeachment late this month or early November.\n\nREPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: HOW A SENATE TRIAL OF TRUMP MIGHT PROCEED\n\nNext Tuesday is the deadline for most of the House\u2019s requests. That coincides with the day the House returns to session. Pelosi will take the temperature of her caucus when lawmakers return.\n\nBut in some respects, Pelosi already knows the temperature. Democrats are seething over the administration failing to meet congressional demands. They think they have a robust case against the president when it comes to obstruction of Congress.\n\nPelosi could grant the administration more time to comply. That would let the issue marinate in public for a bit \u2013 and demonstrate that Democrats aren\u2019t hasty to impeach. But after that, the House Judiciary Committee could begin drafting articles of impeachment.\n\nPelosi doesn\u2019t travel roads like this unless she already knows the outcome. She doesn\u2019t lose votes on the floor \u2013 especially something of this magnitude.\n\nYes, there may be some Democrats who lose their seats over this. But to Pelosi, this isn\u2019t about politics. If it was, she wouldn\u2019t push to impeach. Pelosi thinks President Trump crossed a constitutional line and it\u2019s up to the House to rebuke him \u2013 electoral consequences be damned.\n\nIn the House, one party or the other doesn\u2019t win a sizable majority only to sit on it. They get these majorities to do big things. Look at what Democrats did in passing ObamaCare. Sure, it cost them seats. But ObamaCare remains the law of the land.\n\nREPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: PELOSI'S THINKING IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY EXPLAINED\n\nGranted, in Pelosi\u2019s heart of hearts, she doesn\u2019t like the idea of impeachment. She described this as a \u201csad time.\u201d But the speaker also views this as something Democrats must pursue to check the presidency and preserve the Constitution. To Pelosi, this is way bigger than ObamaCare.\n\nMeantime, Republicans are crowing about \u201cprocess\u201d and the House not taking a formal vote to launch an impeachment inquiry. Republicans want to squeeze vulnerable Democrats by voting to initiate an impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut, one wonders if that tactic could backfire. Would Republicans on shaky turf either A) vote to launch a probe, or, B) face the wrath of voters if they oppose the inquest?\n\nThe \u201clack of a vote to start an impeachment investigation\u201d is a process debate. It is said on Capitol Hill that once you start arguing about \u201cprocess\u201d to the public, you\u2019ve already lost the fight.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like working the refs in basketball. You can\u2019t beat the team on the court -- so it must be the fault of the officials.\n\n\u201cWhat we see in this impeachment is a kangaroo court,\u201d thundered one of President Trump\u2019s most vocal defenders, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. \u201cAdam Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we see in this impeachment is a kangaroo court. Adam Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo.\u201d \u2014 U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nThis may be the first time that a children\u2019s television icon was roped into a debate over impeaching the president of the United States. What\u2019s next? Mister Rogers on North Korea\u2019s weapons program? Bert and Ernie tackling Brexit? Maybe someone could enlist Mr. Moose to tell a knock-knock joke and drop a stockpile of ping-pong balls on everyone\u2019s head.\n\nSome Republicans like Gaetz are more than happy to form a rear-guard for the president. Others aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cOnce you light that fuse,\u201d said one seasoned GOP source of impeachment, \u201canything can happen.\u201d\n\nIt may depend how long the fuse runs.\n\nMost congressional Republicans back Trump \u2013 at least for now. But remember: This was a marriage of convenience. Few GOPers ardently supported the president during the 2016 campaign. But they quickly switched their allegiances after the election.\n\nSome people marry for money, others for prestige. Congressional Republicans married Donald Trump for tax reform and to repeal and replace ObamaCare. They\u2019ve achieved half of that.\n\nCould Republicans abandon the president if impeachment gets too hot?\n\nImpeachment shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with U.S. policy toward Syria. But lawmakers from both sides of the aisle howled when Trump abruptly decided to yank U.S. forces out of northeast Syria. This exposed the Syrian Kurds to an assault from Turkey. Lawmakers were apoplectic, condemning the president\u2019s rash tactic. There are concerns that Trump\u2019s decision could fuel ISIS and diminish global security.\n\nAgain, impeachment has nothing to do with Syria. But it does. If some Republicans are willing to break with the president on that issue, their support could erode on others. This doesn\u2019t mean there will be a Republican jailbreak.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut GOP frustration over the Syria policy could quickly morph into other areas. After all, what will Republicans campaign on next year? Sure, some can beat up impeachment and talk about \u201cThe Squad.\u201d But Republicans privately concede their cupboard is bare when campaigning on a policy agenda. They can\u2019t roll out \u201crepeal and replace ObamaCare\u201d for the umpteenth time.\n\nAnd so the fuse is lit. Impeachment may come sooner rather than later. Gordon Sondland is accruing frequent-flyer miles.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for Mr. Moose to drop some ping-pong balls on someone.", "description": "One thing is clear: The decision by the Trump administration to bar any cooperation with Congress simply hastened the impeachment timetable.", "authors": ["Chad Pergram", "U.S. Rep.
