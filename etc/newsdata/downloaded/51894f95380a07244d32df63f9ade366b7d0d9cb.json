Other network operators have since slowly started releasing similar devices.\n\nSouth Africa doesn\u2019t currently have any regulations which prevent operators from network-locking phones, though locked phones have not been common for at least a decade.\n\nVodacom, MTN, and Cell C said network-locked phones are subsidised and sold at a lower cost to increase accessibility.\n\nOnly entry-level devices are currently network-locked by the operators, with MTN\u2019s network-locked phone starting at R249. That handset sold out after launching in April.\n\nVodacom said that \u2013 in theory \u2013 all phones can be network-locked.\n\n\u201cHowever, it requires agreement between [the] manufacturer and the network operator for it to be implemented,\u201d Vodacom told Business Insider South Africa.\n\nThe operator said it would make no business sense to sell devices below cost without the prospect of recovering some of that investment when the device is used on its network \u2013 such as when buyers defect to a rival network.\n\nNetwork locking was common in South Africa until it fell out of favour through a combination of consumer complaints, threats by regulator Icasa to ban the practice (in rules that were subsequently abandoned), and a rise in services that helped consumers unlock their phones.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "Network-locked devices fell out favour in South Africa a decade ago, but are making a quick comeback.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9519/239fdde4345a4c2295925085bd0c6ef4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
