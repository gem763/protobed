REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe abandonment of the talks, announced on Wednesday, comes at a time when e-cigarettes and vaping are facing intense regulatory and health scrutiny. Juul, in which Altria has a 35% stake, faces a U.S. ban on some products and said its CEO Kevin Burns was stepping down, and that it would suspend all broadcast, print and digital advertising in the United States.\n\nPhilip Morris and Altria, announcing the end of their talks, said they would instead focus on the joint launch of tobacco-heating product iQOS in the United States.\n\n\u201cAfter much deliberation, the companies have agreed to focus on launching iQOS in the U.S. as part of their mutual interest to achieve a smoke-free future,\u201d Philip Morris CEO Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos said.\n\nThe iQOS heat-not-burn product is not a typical vaping device but instead heats packages of ground-up tobacco into a nicotine-filled aerosol.\n\nJuul\u2019s devices, though, vaporize a liquid containing nicotine, and such e-cigarettes have borne the brunt of the regulatory crackdown.\n\nThe deal would have seen the tobacco companies reuniting a decade after their split and creating an industry heavyweight.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t all that surprised given the length of negotiations and the litany of (negative) FDA/health headlines throughout,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note. \u201cIt appears to us the talks fell apart over Juul.\u201d\n\nShares in Philip Morris rose 6.5% in premarket trading, while those of Altria were up 3.7%.\n\nRivals British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and Imperial Brands (IMB.L) rose between 2% as 3% in afternoon trading on Wednesday\u2019s announcements.", "description": "Tobacco giants Philip Morris International and Altria Group have scrapped merger talks as Altria-backed e-cigarette maker Juul Labs sank deeper into crisis and said it would suspend advertising in the United States.", "authors": ["Siddharth Cavale", "Nivedita Balu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433758028&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O15A-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
