Lewandowski testified that the president twice directed him to tell then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to un-recuse himself and shut down Mueller\u2019s investigation of Trump.\n\nThe other buckets of potentially impeachable offenses include obstruction of Congress, a category that covers a laundry list of efforts by Trump to prevent the House from obtaining testimony and documents from various federal officials, agencies and even people who do not work for the government \u2014 like Lewandowski \u2014 over whom Trump has sought to limit disclosures by asserting executive privilege.\n\nThen there are allegations that Trump has used his office to enrich himself in violation of the Constitution\u2019s \u201cemoluments\u201d clause, which prohibits federal officeholders from benefiting financially from their positions\u2026\n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s a miscellaneous category that involves such headings as the president\u2019s alleged failure to defend the country from enemies and his re-appropriation of congressionally approved funds to build a border wall.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics Politics-News"], "top_image": ""}
