What an embarrassing one for Scotland.\n\nAn inspired host nation turned in one of the greatest performances at this or any other World Cup to dump Gregor Townsend\u2019s team out of the World Cup.\n\nThe question now is whether Townsend will resign after failing to take his team into the knock-out stages? It is only the second time Scotland have failed to make the last eight. The only other time it happened was when Andy Robinson was in charge in New Zealand in 2011.\n\nYu Tamura (top) congratulates Keita Inagaki after he scored Japan's second try of the game\n\nTime could also be up for experienced players such as Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw who could retire from international rugby.\n\nAlthough Scotland did stage a second half rally this momentous occasion was all about Japan.\n\nThey wanted it more than Townsend\u2019s team and kept going when it looked like they were going to run out of gas.\n\nIn 2015 Japan beat South Africa and although they didn\u2019t qualify out of their group made a film about it. Heaven knows what they will do to commemorate this very special moment.\n\nFinn Russell had initially put Scotland in front after his seventh minute try\n\nKotaro Matsushima got Japan back into the game with his fifth try of the tournament\n\nYou could sense something special was going to happen as you walked up to the International Stadium in Yokohama.\n\nThe night before a typhoon had killed 26 people and there are still 21 missing.\n\nThat tragedy seemed to heighten the emotions of the fans and the players from the start.\n\nThere was a spine-tingling moment before kick-off when the Japan players walked slowly off the pitch after the warm up.\n\nRather than head off one by one they locked arms and walked off shoulder to shoulder.\n\nThat got the home crowd going and from that moment the noise from their fans was relentless.\n\nThere were a bit of noise from the Scotland fans when the faces of the likes of Darcy Graham and Stuart Hogg came on the big screen during the team announcement but that was one of the few moments their cheers were heard.\n\nKenki Fukuoka scored two fast-break tries to send Japan into a comfortable lead\n\nAn indication of how fired up Scotland was for the occasion came in the first minute. The normally undemonstrative Jonny Gray saw Allan Dell win a turnover and was so pumped he gestured to the Scotland fans to make their voices heard.\n\nWith just five minutes on the clock Scotland took a deserved lead. It all started with a cross kick from Finn Russell aimed for Darcy Graham. It looked like the Japanese defence had won the ball but the Scots stole it back.\n\nThey went through four attacking phases before Greig Laidlaw played a simple pass to Russell.\n\nThe fly-half didn\u2019t have to do much to get past two Japanese defenders for an easy score. Laidlaw converted to give Scotland the perfect start.\n\nDefensively Scotland were sharp with Jamie Ritchie making a vital turnover in front of his own posts to stop a possible Japanese try. Fraser Brown also ripped it out of Japanese hands at a vital stage.\n\nWith 16 minutes on the clock Japan missed the chance to pull back three points. Jamie Ritchie was penalised for a no-arms tackle on Shota Horie but Yu Tamura, the man who had been so reliant with the boot all during the World Cup left, his effort short.\n\nZander Fagerson scored his side's third try giving them hopes of a stunning comeback\n\nTwo minutes later Japan pulled level. Centre Chris Harris did well to make a tackle on Kenki Fukuoka but he managed to offload to winger Kotaro Matsushima.\n\nWith Stuart Hogg in no-man\u2019s land he made the most of the gaps in the Scottish defence to score. Tamura made up for his earlier penalty miss to put over the conversion.\n\nJapan went ahead 14 minutes before the break with one of the greatest tries of this or any other World Cup.\n\nKotaro Matsushima started the move by breaking through two tackles. Horie, James Moore were involved before William Tupou played a pop up pass to Keita Inagaki to score. Tamara put over the extras.\n\nJonny Gray was lucky not to be yellow carded for what looked contact with the head of hooker Horie but breathed a big sigh of relief when referee Ben O\u2019Keefe let him off with a warning.\n\nJapan clearly felt they had the upper-hand over Scotland at the scrum opting for the set-piece rather than kicking to the corner for position.\n\nThey were certainly ahead in the physical battle and won a penalty at the breakdown.\n\nMuch to Scotland\u2019s relief Tamura missed his second three point opportunity of the game.\n\nScotland tried to get back into the game but they left themselves with too much work to do\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter too much as a minute before the break Japan got their third try.\n\nA clever kick ahead from Timothy Lafaele was anticipated by Fukuoka who ran in to score. Tamura put over the extras.\n\nAt half-time the Japanese fans celebrated their lead with a rousing rendition of Take Me Home Country Roads by John Denver in what was a surreal moment.\n\nGregor Townsend made no changes at half-time but maybe he should have.\n\nTwo minutes after the re-start the Japanese side went further ahead. Centre Chris Harris, usually dependable in defence, had the ball stripped out of his grasp by Fukuoka who ran in to score. Tamura got the extras.\n\nIn the 49th minute Scotland saw their chances improve slightly when W P Nel crashed over for a try converted by Greig Laidlaw.\n\nThat brought a bit of hope for Scotland with Finn Russell trying all his tricks.\n\nIt was a quick throw in that he took to himself that led to a forward surge by the Scotland pack that led to Zander Fagerson touching down from a pass from Gray. Russell put over the conversion.\n\nChris Harris battles with Timothy Lafaele of Japan to try and gain possession\n\nTempers flared up late in the game as Jamie Ritchie squared up to Yu Tamura\n\nIt was now just a seven point game with 23 minutes left. That led to even more noise from the Japanese crowd who were willing their team on.\n\nScotland thought they were right back in when Chris Harris went over but it was cancelled out because of a forward pass from Peter Horne in the build up.\n\nTempers were getting understandably frayed as the game reached its climax with Richie lucky to get away with a few late challenges.\n\nAs the clock kept ticking Scotland\u2019s flair players tried everything in their power to dig their team out of a hole. With five minutes left Scotland had a line-out that they won.\n\nIt was spread wide to Harris then all the way across the park to Sam Johnson but still there was no way through. With three minutes left Scotland had a scrum put-in near the Japanese line.\n\nIt was now or never for Scotland. They won possession but couldn\u2019t work their way out of their half. When Japan got a turnover that was it.\n\nThey kept it in the forwards until the final whistle when scenes of incredible joy broke out all over the stadium.", "description": "ROB ROBERTSON IN YOKOHAMA: Japan took a stunning 28-21 victory in Yokahama.
