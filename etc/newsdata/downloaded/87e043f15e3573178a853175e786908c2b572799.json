The burning happened after Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet, author of Make Your Home Among Strangers and a professor at the University of Nebraska, spoke at the university about the book and her personal experiences. Make Your Home Among Strangers follows a young Cuban woman who has to balance the needs of her family with being a minority at a predominately white elite university.\n\nCrucet\u2019s book was assigned to incoming freshman at GSU who each go through a \u201cfirst-year experience\u201d course, and the university had invited her to speak about it at their campus. Several students who spoke with BuzzFeed on the condition of anonymity said attending the discussion was mandatory. GSU did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for clarification.\n\nAfter reading from the book and sharing some personal anecdotes, Crucet took questions from the audience. She received a contentious question from a student who took issue with her opinions on white privilege.\n\n\u201cI noticed that you made a lot of generalizations about the majority of white people being privileged,\u201d the student asked, according to GSU student newspaper The George-Anne. \u201cWhat makes you believe that it\u2019s okay to come to a college campus, like this, when we are supposed to be promoting diversity on this campus, which is what we\u2019re taught. I don\u2019t understand what the purpose of this was.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

After the Q&A, she said many students came forward to apologized to her. She added that they described relating to the protagonist in her novel, a young Latina attending a predominately white university.\n\nThe university decided to relocate Crucet to a different hotel outside of town after a crowd began to form outside her original lodging. Photos and videos of her book being burned also began to appear on social media, including by many who tagged Crucet in tweets. (Some of these messages have since been deleted.)\n\n\u201cTo think of those students watching as a group of their peers burned that story \u2014 effectively erasing them on the campus they are expected to think of as a safe space \u2014 feels devastating,\u201d Crucet wrote in her statement. A spokesperson for Crucet did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe book began as an act of love and an attempt at deeper understanding,\u201d Crucet said. \u201cI hope that GSU can act from the same place and work to affirm the humanity of those students who might understandably feel unsafe in the aftermath of the event and book burning, and that the campus continues the difficult and necessary conversation that began in that auditorium.\u201d\n\nBuzzFeed also reported that the students will not face disciplinary actions. \u201cWhile it\u2019s within the students\u2019 First Amendment rights, book burning does not align with Georgia Southern\u2019s values nor does it encourage the civil discourse and debate of ideas,\u201d said John Lester, Vice President for Strategic Communications and Marketing in an emailed statement to the The George-Anne.\n\nGSU\u2019s Department of Writing and Linguistics condemned the book burning in a Thursday statement signed by the department chair. \u201cWe assert that destructive and threatening acts do not reflect the values of Georgia Southern University,\u201d the statement says.\n\nWrite to Jasmine Aguilera at jasmine.aguilera@time.com.", "description": "Georgia Southern University students burned copies of Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet's book about navigating life as a woman of color", "authors": ["Jasmine Aguilera"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/crucet-georgia-university-book-burning.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
