I\u2019m stronger than I ever thought I was. If this happened to anyone else in my family I know I\u2019d be an emotional wreck.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE)\n\n\u201cNothing will stop me. I\u2019m alive and I have got to live my life. I\u2019ve got a lot of years left. I\u2019m going to be here to see my daughters marry and become a grandparent. I\u2019ve learned to live for each day and live life to the full.\u201d\n\nKaren\u2019s horrific experience began in July last year. She had just been on a four-day holiday to North Wales, which included a trip on the 5,101ft Zip World Velocity 2, reputedly the world\u2019s fastest zip line, a Christmas gift from her lorry driver partner Lyndon Paget.\n\nKaren had returned to work at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, but became ill and spent three days feeling achy and shivery, with a high temperature.\n\nShe woke up at 2am feeling too hot to sleep. She said: \u201cI got up to use the loo and noticed my feet were really aching, it was very painful to walk. I was quite breathless and became really frightened. I was banging on the banister to let Lyndon know I couldn\u2019t get upstairs.\n\n(Image: Barry Gomer)\n\n\u201cI said to him \u2018I think I\u2019m going to die.\u2019\u201d\n\nLyndon drove her to A&E at Derriford, where she has worked for 16 years. Her blood pressure was very low and she was taken to the resuscitation ward. Karen knew low blood pressure affects the supply to organs and said: \u201cI was scared but I was in the best place.\u201d\n\nAn intensive care unit \u00addoctor told her she had sepsis and she had a catheter fitted and was put on an IV drip.\n\nShe was told she may have an infection in the bowel and that evening she had a six-hour operation to remove part of her bowel and spleen.\n\nKaren still does not know why she developed sepsis although it may be related to her \u00adpreviously undiagnosed Crohn\u2019s disease, an inflammatory bowel \u00adcondition.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE)\n\nShe spent five days in a medically \u00adinduced coma and doctors warned her family she might not make it. When she came round her kidneys were \u00adfailing so she was also put on dialysis to clean her blood.\n\nKaren said: \u201cMy feet and fingers were black. My legs were all mushy. I knew the surgeon wouldn\u2019t hold back in telling me the truth. The medical team had to work out where the healthy tissue was compared with the dead \u00adtissue, so they were asking me to walk.\n\n\u201cIt was the most horrific time I can remember. The pain was like a red hot poker going up through my heel and up the back of my leg.\n\n\u201cMy fingers were really hard. If you rapped them on the table it was like banging a piece of wood on them. There was no feeling.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE)\n\n\u201cOne of the legs was dead and there was a risk of the sepsis coming back in the other.\n\n\u201cI was told if I did not have them amputated I wouldn\u2019t survive and I knew it was best just to have both my legs off. On August 28, Karen had both legs amputated.\n\nDuring her recovery she had \u00adunstinting support from Lyndon, 56, and her daughters, receptionist Gaby, 23, and \u00adhealthcare assistant Rebecca, 24.\n\nRecalling the day after her amputations, she said: \u201cMy first thought was that my stumps looked beautiful. The shape was beautiful.\u201d\n\nShe recalled: \u201cThose ten days after my first operation were so awful for my family. To me, they were a blur, but I know Lyndon was really struggling.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE)\n\nIn September last year Karen was \u00adfinally allowed home but five more operations followed to remove her fingers and graft skin from her abdomen on to her hands. One last op, an abdomen procedure, happened on October 1, this year.\n\nKaren, who has been left with two thumbs and half of her forefinger on her left hand, said: \u201cIn some ways, I found losing dexterity in my hands harder than losing my legs. You do everything with your hands and you take your fingers for granted until they\u2019re not there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to teach myself how to write again. I couldn\u2019t hold a knife but I\u2019ve taught myself to do it. I\u2019ve started \u00adwrapping presents for people\u2019s birthdays. It\u2019s working out how to do things \u00addifferently. I can do things, I just do them slower and in a different way.\u201d\n\nKaren learned to walk with her \u00adprosthetic limbs, with the help of parallel bars, on the same day she had them fitted in February.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE)\n\nShe said: \u201cIt was amazing, a very \u00ademotional moment. I was very lucky as I had a great physiotherapist and assistant who pushed me. By July I was able to walk on my own just using sticks. It has been a gradual process.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m one of those people who needs to run before they can walk.\u201d\n\nKaren and Lyndon used to live an \u00adactive life before she contracted sepsis, \u00adincluding walks together along the coast.\n\nShe is determined to get back to doing what she loves. With the help of pals, who have raised nearly \u00a314,000 using JustGiving, she will soon be fitted with more lightweight prosthetics.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe new prosthetics cost about \u00a37,500 each, but I\u2019ll have to wait for about two years for my stumps to shrink for them to settle down and get down to the size they will stay.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not planning any kind of prosthetic for my fingers. I can manage without them. It\u2019s \u00addifficult but there\u2019s always a way around things.\n\n\"Now I\u2019ve had my final surgery, my next step is to get a car, so I can have my independence and get back to work.\n\n\"I won\u2019t be able to do what I was doing before but my boss has been very supportive and is finding something for me.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Karen is working hard to make people aware of the signs of sepsis, including slurred speech, extreme shivering and muscle pain, not passing urine, severe breathlessness and mottled skin, all signs that she had herself.\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople are still dying from sepsis. It\u2019s such a dangerous thing and it has such a huge impact on people and their families.\n\n\u201cIt helps me to talk about it. If I can help one person by letting them know what happened, that will be enough.\u201d\n\nFor more on sepsis see sepsistrust.org.
