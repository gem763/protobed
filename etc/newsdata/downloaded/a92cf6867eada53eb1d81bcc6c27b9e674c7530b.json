It did not give specifics.\n\nFrequent flyer programs \u2014 provided by almost all airlines around the world \u2014 are designed to reward and encourage customers for traveling with the same airline, by giving them the option to upgrade their class, or get free flights, if they rack up a certain amount of points.\n\nSome passengers take extra flights to reach or maintain benefits with certain airlines, which is the kind of behavior the proposal would target.\n\nThe CCC's proposal could discourage flyers from remaining loyal to certain airlines or discourage them from flying as much as before.\n\nAirlines would also risk losing out to competitors as travelers lose incentive to stay loyal.\n\nAirlines who partner with banks to issue airline-branded credit cards could also lose revenue, as they currently receive money from the bank for every mile the card user accrues, Bloomberg reported in 2017.\n\nA general view of planes at London Heathrow Airport. Reuters\n\nThe CCC has also proposed an \"air miles levy\" to target frequent flyers while protecting those who don't travel as much or travel shorter distances.\n\nBy placing the levies on frequent flyers, rather than a flat fuel tax, those who don't fly as often would in theory not be disproportionately affected.\n\n\"Aviation has so far enjoyed generous tax treatment despite a large proportion of flights being taken by a small, wealthy segment of the population,\" the CCC said.\n\n\"Given that there is a finite budget of carbon emissions allowable if global warming is to be held below 1.5 degrees, the highly uneven distribution of emissions due to flying raise equity concerns.\"\n\nThe levy would increase according to the number of air miles flown, rather than the number of flights taken, the CCC said. Carbon emissions from one long-haul flight could be higher than those from several short-haul flights.\n\nImposing an \"air miles levy\" would \"limit rising demand for flying in a way that does not make it inaccessible to lower-income households [and] encourage shift in demand from flying to trains and from long-haul to short-haul,\" the CCC said.\n\nAn environmental protester in Bonn, Germany, in November 2017. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nThe report also listed a series of recommendations to help the UK government achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 \u2014 a challenge that, according to the CCC, the country is not ready to meet at this rate.\n\nHere are some of the other recommendations:\n\nIncrease government funding for the procurement of electric vehicles for the UK government and local authorities.\n\nReopen disused rail lines and bus services in the UK to make people less reliant on cars.\n\nFund training in plant-based, or vegan, cooking so people can eat less meat and dairy when they're out.\n\nIntroduce laws to discourage larger-than-required portion sizing in restaurants.\n\nThe report comes as more and more governments and businesses are signaling willingness to take climate change more seriously.\n\nRead more: Here's why JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs say 2019 is the year climate change is at the top of investors' minds\n\nEnvironmental activists have also resort to extreme protest measures in recent days, with a demonstrator linked to the UK's Extinction Rebellion movement climbing on top of a British Airways plane last week, ostensibly to bring attention to \"the climate and ecological crisis.\"", "description": "The Committee on Climate Change says that just 15% of the entire British population take 70% of all flights from the country.", "authors": ["Alexandra Ma"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da438824af90906f54625d2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
