Unaware of what it was, they filmed the dramatic sight.\n\nA beautiful streak of light that exploded outward into a wide beam of white light turned out to be a Trident missile. In the footage, the crew can be heard saying \u2018Wow,\u2019 as they look out at the shooting star beside their Airbus liner.\n\nThe video published by The Drive was shot from a plane flying from Guadalajara to Tijuana sometime in early September. It clearly shows two-stage separations as the missile launched from the Ohio-class submarine USS \u2018Nebraska\u2019 skips through the sky westward.\n\nAmazing cockpit video of unusual Trident ballistic missile test may point to new warhead:https://t.co/llvKbmZqlW \u2014 The War Zone (@thewarzonewire) October 5, 2019\n\nDefense experts told The Drive that the trajectory of the Trident appeared unusually flat, possibly indicating a test of the missile\u2019s ability to deliver the W76-2 warhead. A derivative of the standard W76-1, it has dramatically lower yield and consequently a smaller weight. A lighter payload allows the delivery vehicle to be fired at a depressed trajectory, which sacrifices range for the sake of faster travel time and better survivability against enemy anti-ballistic missile measures.\n\nThe filmed test was one of a series conducted between September 4 and September 6.\n\nLike this story?
