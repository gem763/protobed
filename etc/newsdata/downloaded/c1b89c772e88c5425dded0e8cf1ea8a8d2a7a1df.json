'When we're talking about Leicester getting top six and we're not quite sure who will miss out, certainly Man United will be one of the big candidates of the top six to miss out, with Leicester going strong.\n\n'I think it was promising last week for Manchester United, I think first-half they were excellent. But you can't play like that against the majority of teams they come up against.\n\n'Actually seeing Manchester United in the next couple of games against Norwich and Bournemouth, they're tests for Manchester United - are they good enough to go and open those teams up?'\n\n'They have a massive problem, they can't score more than one goal in a game.'\n\nUnited have not scored more than one goal in a game since the 4-0 opening day victory against Chelsea - a run now stretching to 12 games in all competitions, after a 1-0 win at Partisan Belgrade in the Europa League on Thursday.\n\nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville agreed that United are in danger of losing their top six status this season.\n\n'They absolutely could [drop out of the top six],' Neville said.\n\n'I always worry a little bit when you come out of a big game which is easy to get up for and a reaction was needed, when you say \"I was proud of my players today\" because you need to be proud of your players every single week.\n\nJamie Carragher and Gary Neville were chatting to Kelly Cates on Sky's Friday Night Football\n\nSolskajer's Manchester United have league games against Norwich and Bournemouth next\n\n'You couldn't be more confident going into the game against Norwich than you were against Liverpool.\n\n'Manchester United have let you down this season. West Ham, Southampton, other games of this nature where they've been really poor.\n\n'Can those players get up for those games, can they break teams down who defend deep and counter-attack on them?'", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have had a poor start to this season, and have not won in four Premier League games since a 1-0 victory against Leicester on September 14 - they currently lie in 14th place.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/20/20195304-0-image-a-14_1572032288214.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
