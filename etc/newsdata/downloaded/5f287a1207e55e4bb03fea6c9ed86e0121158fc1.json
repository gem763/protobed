Do I need to say more about him and the mental state of bhakts who follow him?\u201d\n\nRegardless of your political alignment, if you are a historian or academician in charge of what the nation needs to know, this post by a highly educated young man from your own nation and your own people is posing a question that needs a honest answer.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t a kid, who has gone through Indian education system, is never made to encounter the fact that it was Savarkar\u2019s brave publication of the 1909 book \u201cThe Indian War of Independence\u201d that changed the narrative about this momentous event in the history of our nation from \u201csepoy mutiny\u201d to a \u201cwar for independence\u201d?\n\nIf you are an academician, you can blame me for reading too much in such a small dataset of one single post, but if we are not fooling ourselves, the candid truth is, it will be very difficult to come across young kids who is aware of the existence of Savarkar\u2019s landmark book, forget having read it.\n\nAs it is fashionable in academic circles to laugh at any attempt of connecting India with glory, any such debate always ends up turning political and ultimately deteriorates to Hindu bashing, so I would like to skip the politically loaded Savarkar theme and move elsewhere away from saffronised Gangetic plains to the safer heavens of South and Central India.\n\nForget Savarkar if he is uncomfortable, but can our academicians and historians explain why a massive pre-Mughal period of the great Indian Empires, the likes of Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Pallavas, Pandyas, Cholas or Rastrakutas and their glorious achievements are almost missing from our books?\n\nIf we take a poll of how many people know about Vakatakas that left behind wonderful artworks at Ellora Caves followed by Rashtrakuta King Krishna-I who continued the tradition and built Kailasa Temple, one the greatest monuments built by human race, there is little doubt that the result would yield a number very close to what we are proudly stating to have gifted to the world.\n\nIt is clear that either our academicians are ashamed of the great achievements of our ancestors and hence have kept them away from Indian education or they have an explanation that I can\u2019t fathom.\n\nThe problem as I see is that Indian historians have spent more time debating about the political agendas instead of actually bothering to doing research on history.\n\nIf we really had academia more interested in history and less in academic tenures that the political masters offered as rewards to the faithful, Indian history would have been an endless ocean for researchers to dive into and enjoy its grandeur.\n\nFew civilisations on Earth offer an almost 5000 years of continuity and hence India could have been a heaven for researcher, but instead history is a battleground and academicians are busy debating politics.\n\nAt this point India is a country and it has not turned into a nation of people because we have simply not bothered to dig into our history enough.\n\nWhat we need is to start research and my humble guess is that the findings will take care of our need of building a nation.\n\nIt may be unnerving for few to step out of the comfort of inferiority complex, and hence they may fight against the idea of relooking at Indian history on the ground of it being a supremacist or hyper-nationalist pursuit, but it is not an excuse enough, as it is difficult not to see an agenda in what we currently have.\n\nIf our elite academia is fearing a rise of nationalism by rewriting Indian history from Indian perspective, that itself is a telling evidence that it is a history worth researching on and letting our kids have an option of reading it with an Indian eye too.", "description": "I am not really fond of conspiracy theories, nor do I like to have paranoia, but something is surely amiss here and someone, especially from academia needs to explain.
