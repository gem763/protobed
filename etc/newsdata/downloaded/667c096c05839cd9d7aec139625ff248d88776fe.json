(Eric Gay/AP)\n\nFederal judges in New York, Texas and California sided against two of the Trump administration\u2019s key immigration initiatives Friday, the latest lower court ruling against the president\u2019s push for new physical and administrative barriers to migrants.\n\nIn El Paso, the court ruled the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to reprogram military funds for the construction of border fencing was a violation of appropriation laws, a decision that could freeze work on the barrier in that area.\n\nAnd in separate rulings in New York, California and Washington state, judges partly blocked the implementation of the \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule that aimed to disqualify immigrants from receiving green cards if they use public benefits or the government considers them likely to do so.\n\nThe decisions were the latest setbacks to the administration\u2019s broader attempt to tighten the legal immigration system at the same time the president is seeking to erect hundreds of miles of towering steel barriers along the Mexico border using billions of dollars diverted from military budgets.\n\n[\u2018He always brings them up\u2019: Trump tries to steer border wall deal to North Dakota firm]\n\nIn the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Judge David Briones sided with the plaintiffs \u2014 El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights \u2014 and gave them 10 days to file a proposal for a preliminary injunction. Briones, a Clinton appointee, denied the administration\u2019s motion to dismiss the suit, which was filed in April.\n\nThe decision Friday is the first instance of a local jurisdiction successfully suing to block construction of Trump\u2019s border barrier. El Paso County authorities argued it would inflict harm to the local community\u2019s reputation by creating an impression that the city is dangerous and unwelcoming.\n\nOn Sept. 18, President Trump visited the U.S.-Mexico border wall in Otay Mesa, Calif. to examine the construction. (The Washington Post)\n\nDavid Bookbinder, an attorney for the plaintiffs, called it a \u201cnice, neat, small ruling\u201d that avoided broader constitutional questions about the president\u2019s authority. The ruling instead zeroed in on what the judge said were violations that exceeded the executive branch\u2019s authority to divert money appropriated by Congress for a specific purpose.\n\nBookbinder said it would take his clients \u201ca few days\u201d to determine what government activity they will seek to halt. The injunction probably would extend beyond El Paso County into areas of New Mexico, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a question of geography,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to specifically describe the areas of the border where the president will not be able to construct the wall.\u201d\n\nTrump this year diverted $3.6 billion in military construction funds to pay for hundreds of miles of 30-foot-tall steel bollard fencing. The administration has built 71 miles of new barriers so far, but Trump has promised to complete nearly 500 miles by the end of next year.\n\nEl Paso County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal said the county commissioners took a potentially risky step in suing the president but said the action was necessary because his portrayal of the border as a dangerous area was damaging the economy and other important aspects of community life.\n\n\u201cYou have the president of the United States declaring a national emergency, and we can look outside and see that there\u2019s no national emergency,\u201d Bernal said.\n\nAt a meeting last month led by White House adviser Jared Kushner, administration officials discussed a plan to reprogram another $3.6 billion in Pentagon money if lawmakers do not provide funds for the barriers through the appropriations process.\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn New York, Judge George B. Daniels blocked the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule, calling it \u201cunlawful, arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nA 93-page ruling in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California rejected the government\u2019s arguments on similar grounds, but with a more geographically limited scope.\n\n\n\nKen Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, speaks to reporters outside the White House on Sept. 27. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nKen Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which was preparing to implement the public charge rule this month, suggested the government would appeal.\n\n\u201cAn objective judiciary will see that this rule lies squarely within long-held existing law,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cLong-standing federal law requires aliens to rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, sponsors, and private organizations in their communities to succeed. The public charge regulation defines this long-standing law to ensure those seeking to come or stay in the United States can support themselves financially and will not rely on public benefits.\u201d\n\nU.S. immigration laws have long held provisions allowing the government to bar immigrants who are considered at risk of becoming dependent on public support, but the Trump administration\u2019s initiative would expand the types of benefits that could be taken into consideration, including Medicaid, food assistance and federal housing vouchers.\n\nImmigrant advocates and officials in several jurisdictions have claimed the measures have had a chilling effect even before their implementation, discouraging families from seeking medical care, shelter and food.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, one of the plaintiffs suing the government, celebrated the ruling. \u201cOnce again, the courts have thwarted the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to enact rules that violate both our laws and our values, sending a loud and clear message that they cannot rewrite our story to meet their agenda,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nRobert Moore in El Paso contributed to this report.", "description": "Successive injunctions hit the government Friday, decisions that are likely to face appeals.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security", "October At Pm", "Nick Miroff Covers Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security For The Washington Post.
