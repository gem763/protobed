Hunter, you\u2019ll recall, was paid $50,000 a month by Ukraine\u2019s largest gas company to be a board member, even though he had no background that would qualify him for such a position.\n\nWhile the transcript of the call showed none of the things Democrats had claimed, that hasn\u2019t stopped the impeachment train. But in their attacks against Trump, the top 2020 Democrats have been in a tough situation: defend Biden and risk boosting the former VP or come out against him. Instead, their reactions have been somewhere in the middle.\n\nFLAG: Senator Elizabeth Warren appears uncharacteristically flustered when asked if her ethics plan would allow her Vice President's son to serve on the board of a foreign company: \"No,\" she said. \"I don't know. I mean I\u2019d have to go back and look at the details.\" #nhpolitics pic.twitter.com/EksLlMEsew \u2014 Nicole Sganga (@NicoleSganga) September 25, 2019\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren suggested she\u2019d consider barring her vice president\u2019s children from serving on the boards of foreign companies, the very kind of business arrangement Trump has used in unfounded attacks accusing Biden and his son Hunter of corruption. When asked whether Trump\u2019s attacks reflect on Biden\u2019s \u201ccampaign or his character,\u201d California Sen. Kamala Harris said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to the pundits. I don\u2019t have a comment on that.\u201d And Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who in 2016 defended Hillary Clinton against attacks over her use of a private email server as secretary of state, sidestepped a question about whether the Biden controversy makes him a weaker candidate. The reactions signal just how contentious the Democratic primary could become in the months ahead if it unfolds against the backdrop of impeachment proceedings in Congress. Even as Biden\u2019s leading competitors for the Democratic presidential nomination accuse Trump of abusing the power of his office, they have been willing to let Biden navigate the situation on his own. (AP)\n\nAs the AP story goes on to report, it's only some of the long-shot candidates who have been willing to come to Biden's defense.\n\nSo far, Biden has opted to not respond directly. Over the weekend, when a reporter asked about whether he'd spoken to Hunter about working in Ukraine, Biden waved his finger at him and told him to \"ask the right questions.\"", "description": ".09/27/2019 7:57:43AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Reagan Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/221/f829d053-db84-48e0-a76d-a3d97494aa08.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
