It is a curiosity how a self-declaring Christian can still stand strong on the side of abortion rights.\n\nThis is what Buttigieg said a few days ago on a \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d radio interview: \u201cRight now, [conservatives] hold everybody in line with this one piece of doctrine about abortion, which is obviously a tough issue for a lot of people to think through morally. Then again, there\u2019s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath. So even that is something we can interpret differently.\u201d\n\nOK. But not Christians.\n\nChristians don\u2019t interpret the Bible to believe life begins at \u201cbreath.\u201d\n\nActually, Christians don\u2019t generally try to \u201cinterpret\u201d the Bible but rather understand the words as they\u2019re written, as God intended them to be understood \u2014 as truths from Him, not as recommendations, and certainly not as starting points for how to comfortably apply only those principles that fit the modern mold.\n\nBut let\u2019s say for the moment that the South Bend, Indiana, mayor is right, that he\u2019s got a point, that life does begin at \u201cbreath.\u201d\n\nA baby in the womb relies on the mother\u2019s umbilical cord to deliver oxygen-dense blood, and on the mother\u2019s own exhalations to breathe out carbon dioxide. In essence, the baby\u2019s breathing \u2014 with assistance. It\u2019s assisted living. It\u2019s assisted breathing. And you don\u2019t assist the non-living with breathing.\n\nAs Glezman told Tucker Carlson on Fox: \u201c[What\u2019s] alarming is that there are Christians who would stand, like Mayor Pete would, and say that God condones, that God says that abortion is OK according to Scripture. That\u2019s just absurd and outlandish to me.\u201d\n\nYes, it is.\n\nAbsurd, outlandish and an utter lie.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
