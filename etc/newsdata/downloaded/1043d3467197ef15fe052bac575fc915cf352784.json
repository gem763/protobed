I recently wrote about how one longtime U.S. ally, the Philippines, is repositioning itself between Washington and Beijing. But Manila is hardly alone in trying to protect itself as the geopolitical giants clash.\n\nSingapore confronts a similar challenge, which was thrown into relief by an interview that its prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, gave last week. Lee's remarks may rankle some U.S. analysts. Yet they highlight the dilemmas faced by weaker states \u2014 and point to some imperatives of success for America.\n\nFirst under the legendary Lee Kuan Yew, and now under his eldest son, Singapore has pulled off a shrewd balancing act in a contentious neighborhood. Singapore's dynamic economy has been buoyed by Chinese trade and investment, and its population is mostly ethnic Chinese. Yet getting too close to a powerful China can be dangerous, so Singapore\u2019s government has long viewed Washington as a critical counterweight to Beijing's power. As that power has increased in recent decades, so has Singapore's security cooperation with the U.S.\n\nSingapore's armed forces regularly train with (and in) the U.S., and Singapore hosts the U.S. Navy's Logistics Group Western Pacific as well as deployments of littoral combat ships and P-8 maritime surveillance planes. U.S. aircraft carriers conduct port visits in Singapore, a visible reminder that Washington takes an interest in the country's security. Singapore remains officially neutral; unlike the Philippines, it does not have a treaty relationship with the U.S. Yet if the Philippines is an ally that acts like a partner, as a senior U.S. official once put it, Singapore is a partner that acts like an ally.\n\nThis Singaporean balancing act was underscored by Lee\u2019s interview with the Washington Post. Building on a speech he gave in May, at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, Lee gave a warning to America and China alike.\n\nThe trend toward seeing the U.S.-China competition as \u201ca conflict between two systems, almost two civilizations\u201d is \u201cvery worrying,\u201d he said. The U.S. should not delude itself into thinking that pressure can bring about the collapse of the Chinese Communist Party; it should bear in mind that an economic and technological divorce between the world\u2019s leading powers would create an impossible situation for America\u2019s friends \u201cso deeply enmeshed with the Chinese.\u201d If the U.S. insists that these countries choose sides, it might not like the results: \u201cWhere is your part of the world, and who will be in your system?\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Lee acknowledged that China\u2019s behavior has become more truculent, due to rising geopolitical ambitions and growing internal difficulties. He also argued that China can no longer act like a developing country, but must bear its \u201cshare of responsibility upholding and supporting the global system\u201d that has made it so rich and powerful. If a disastrous geopolitical showdown is to be averted, \u201cstatesmanship, consistency, perseverance and wisdom\u201d will be required from both sides.\n\nSome of Lee\u2019s comments are a bit grating, from an American perspective. He implies a certain moral equivalency between the U.S. and China, and alludes only obliquely to Beijing\u2019s horrifying abuses of the Uighurs in Xinjiang. Other aspects of his comments reflect an attitude better suited to 2005 than 2019: It is abundantly clear by now that China just won\u2019t become a \u201cresponsible stakeholder\u201d in an American-led system. Yet Lee\u2019s comments shouldn\u2019t be dismissed, because they illuminate three critical issues the U.S. will face in rallying an international coalition to counter Chinese power.\n\nFirst, a larger confrontation with China will be economically painful for U.S. \u2014 but it could be economically devastating for America\u2019s key allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific, all of which are deeply interdependent with Beijing in commercial, financial and technological terms. The prospect of a technological or economic Iron Curtain coming down is alarming for countries whose economic interests pull one way while their security interests pull another. To be sure, the U.S. can\u2019t compete successfully with China unless its friends become less dependent on Beijing: Some selective de-coupling from the Chinese economy is important, even if wholesale de-coupling remains implausible. Yet the only way to get countries such as Singapore to reduce their dependence on Beijing is to vastly deepen the possibilities for economic, financial and technological integration within the U.S.-led coalition. Here, America presently seems like an uncertain partner, at best.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- These are fraught times for Asia-Pacific nations caught in the crossfire of the intensifying U.S.-China rivalry.
