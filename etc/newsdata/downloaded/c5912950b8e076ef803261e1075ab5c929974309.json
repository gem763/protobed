I\u2019ve got a job and I\u2019m looking after my kids,\u2019 she told Daily Star Sunday.\n\nFair play to her, to be honest. God forbid someone actually earn a living or even wanting to try a new direction in life.\n\nKatie\u2019s best known for playing Hayley Slater in EastEnders \u2013 who wreaked havoc across Albert Square after having a one-night stand with her cousin Kat\u2019s (Jessie Wallace) husband Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThings got complicated when she had a baby girl, Cherry, with Alfie, and Kat discovered the truth on Christmas day for an explosive festive episode.\n\nHer character later ran away from a mental health facility in February, leaving an open possibility for return as fans thought she may make a reappearance in the future.\n\nKatie\u2019s complicated character Hayley was last seen fleeing from a mental health facility (Picture: BBC)\n\nBut since then the actress has not taken on any new roles.\n\nAnd if she wants to give up acting all together, more power to her. Good on her for putting her family first.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
