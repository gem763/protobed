Meghan Markle (seen at Windsor Castle this month) could simply pick up where she left off in her acting career and earn at least \u00a3350k\n\nMeghan Markle could quickly pick up where she left off in her acting career.\n\nAfter appearing in various well known shows such as CSI: Miami, her most high-profile role came when playing Rachel Zane on the popular television show Suits.\n\nAccording to knownetworth.com, right before marrying Prince Harry, she made about \u00a3350,000 per year from her Suits annual salary as well as various endorsement deals and sponsorships.\n\nSophie, Countess of Wessex - PR at \u00a340k\n\nSophie trained as a secretary at West Kent College in Tonbridge before beginning a career in public relations which saw her work for a variety of organisations \u2013 including Capital Radio during a four-year stint, which could earn her up to \u00a340,000 a year\n\nSophie trained as a secretary at West Kent College in Tonbridge before beginning a career in public relations which saw her work for a variety of organisations \u2013 including Capital Radio during a four-year stint.\n\nShe also spent a year travelling and working in Australia and Switzerland, where she worked as a ski representative.\n\nIn 1996, she launched her own public relations company, which she ran for five years.\n\nDue to her extensive work experience (compared to other members of the royal family) she could earn up to \u00a340,000 a year working in public relations.\n\nSomeone with her vast experience in public relations shouldn\u2019t spend too much time on the job market, especially since she has a proven track record of successfully running a PR firm.\n\nPrince Edward, Earl of Wessex - Production Assistant \u00a328k\n\nIf Edward was to relinquish his duties as an active member of the royal family, he could most certainly pursue a career in media and theatre production - experienced production assistants can earn up to \u00a328,000 per annum\n\nIf Edward was to relinquish his duties as an active member of the royal family, he could most certainly pursue a career in media and theatre production.\n\nAfter his short stint in the Royal Navy, he worked as a production assistant on musicals for a London-based theatre company.\n\nHe formed his own television production company in 1993 where he worked as producing director and joint managing director. The company was dissolved in 2009, with assets reduced to just \u00a340.\n\nExperienced production assistants can earn up to \u00a328,000 per annum, so Edward can go back to his roots and earn more than any of the previous royals on our list. The typical tenure for a Production Assistant is less than one year and there are about 735 job listings for such roles during the course of a year.\n\nKate Middleton - Administrator \u00a323k\n\nKate Middleton's degree and work experience before marrying Prince William would earn her an annual salary of up to \u00a323,000 in a corporate administrative or marketing role\n\nKate Middleton could be the first British queen with a university degree.\n\nIn fact, she is currently the UK\u2019s first royal bride with a university degree. She attended the University of St. Andrews in Fife, Scotland, and accepted a position as an accessory buyer with British retailer Jigsaw shortly after graduating.\n\nShe was reportedly in charge of fulfilling various administrative duties and running errands during photo shoots.\n\nShe then worked for her parents\u2019 party supplies company. After modeling for the company\u2019s catalogues, as well as working on the catalogue design team and overseeing their production, she also had a stint as part of the company\u2019s marketing department.\n\nHer work experience before marrying Prince William would earn her an annual salary of up to \u00a323,000 in a corporate administrative or marketing role. With a wealth of such roles currently being advertised as open, she shouldn\u2019t expect to be on the job market for more than a month if she were to focus all her attention on finding work.\n\nPrinces Harry and William - Charity workers \u00a321k\n\nHarry and William have both had successful military careers and are both heavily involved in charity work. However, their work experience would only land them a \u00a321,000 yearly salary\n\nHarry and William have both had successful military careers and are both heavily involved in charity work. However, their work experience would only land them a \u00a321,000 yearly starting salary in charity.\n\nThe princes would find the most success in looking for charity officer jobs or re-joining the army.\n\nArmy roles offer the best earning potential in the long run, with captains making \u00a342,000 per annum and majors earning as much as \u00a355,000 every year.\n\nIf they were to rejoin the army, they would likely be taken back immediately, seeing as they both had successful military careers.\n\nLooking for a job in the charity sector, however, would make for a lengthier process which would depend on the number of candidates applying at that time and the number of job openings. There are 168,000 charities in England and Wales which employ roughly 870,00 paid workers (according to prospects.ac.uk).\n\nPrincess Anne - Charity officer \u00a319k\n\nPrincess Anne's extensive work with charities such as Save the Children, during which she visited a number of African countries, would recommend her for a job as a charity officer or coordinator at \u00a319k\n\nPrincess Anne would earn slightly less if she were to get a job in today\u2019s market.\n\nHer extensive work with charities such as Save the Children, during which she visited a number of African countries, would recommend her for a job as a charity officer or coordinator.\n\nWithout much work experience, she would probably find it difficult to find a job and might be on the market for a while. She could expect to earn less than Prince Harry and William, with an expected salary of \u00a319,000 in her first year on the job.\n\nCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall - Secretary \u00a317,500\n\nCamilla didn\u2019t follow a traditional academic path; she was instead sent to finishing schools. Her limited experience as a secretary would likely only earn her a \u00a317,500 annual salary.\n\nCamilla didn\u2019t follow a traditional academic path; she was instead sent to finishing schools.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Gate School in South Kensington, which she started attending at the age of 10, is known to provide wives for members of the nobility and Foreign Office.\n\nAfter attending various finishing schools, the duchess worked part-time as a secretary in London.\n\nHer more limited experience as a secretary would only earn her a \u00a317,500 annual salary.\n\nOn the bright side, there is no shortage of secretarial positions in the UK, so she wouldn\u2019t be on the market for too long.", "description": "Prince Harry, Sophie Wessex and Kate Middleton are among the members of the family whose skills and qualifications were analysed to match them with a job and\u00a0 salary.", "authors": ["Jessica Rach For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/12/20373706-0-image-a-49_1572437897393.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
