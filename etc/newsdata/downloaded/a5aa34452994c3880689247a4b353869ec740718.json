Here's everything we know about the candidate and how he stacks up against the competition.", "language": "en", "text": "Who is Cory Booker?\n\nCurrent job: US Senator from New Jersey. Running for president of the United States as a Democratic candidate.\n\nAge: 49\n\nFamily: Booker is not married but is dating actress and activist Rosario Dawson.\n\nHometown: Newark, New Jersey\n\nPolitical party: Democratic\n\nPrevious jobs: Attorney. Newark city councilman from 1998 to 2002. Mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013.\n\nWho is Cory Booker's direct competition for the nomination?\n\nBased on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in Cory Booker's lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party.\n\nThe average Booker-satisfied respondent said they were satisfied with 5.5 other candidates , which is pretty high: it means that people who like him tend to be considering several other choices. To stay competitive, he'll want to be in line with the top candidates in the race, for whom that number is less than 4. Just 2 percent of his supporters liked him and him alone.\n\n, which is pretty high: it means that people who like him tend to be considering several other choices. To stay competitive, he'll want to be in line with the top candidates in the race, for whom that number is less than 4. Just 2 percent of his supporters liked him and him alone. Of those who said they'd be satisfied with Booker as nominee, over 70% would also be satisfied with Biden as nominee. That's really high, roughly 10 percentage points higher than Biden's satisfaction rate among general Democrats. Biden's candidacy is a serious threat to Booker's ability to maintain a constituency.\n\nTwo thirds of respondents content with Booker as nominee would also be satisfied with Sen. Kamala Harris as nominee. That satisfaction rate is roughly 15 percentage points higher than Harris' satisfaction among Democrats overall.\n\nA majority of those satisfied with Booker would also be satisfied with the nomination of former Rep. Beto O'Rourke or Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Among Booker fans, O'Rourke outperforms his satisfaction rate among Democrats generally by about 8 percentage points, and Warren by over 10 percentage points.\n\nThe takeaway is that Booker has considerable overlap with serious contenders, and this could go well \u2014 people identify him as a consensus candidate \u2014 or it could go disastrously: his potential support is divided among rivals.\n\nINSIDER has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate's constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.\n\nRead more about how we're polling this here.\n\nWhat are Cory Booker's policy positions?\n\nWhat are Cory Booker's political successes?\n\nWhile not a policy achievement, Booker gained fame as mayor of Newark for saving a woman from a burning house, carrying her out of the building as it went up in flames.\n\nBooker gets mixed reviews on the enduring impact of his policies as mayor of Newark, but brought a lot of attention to the city and is often credited for attracting businesses and investment.\n\nBooker helped convince Facebook to pledge $100 million toward improving Newark's schools (though the results of that donation have been debated).\n\nBooker is a national figure when it comes to criminal justice reform, and was instrumental garnering bipartisan support behind legislation aimed at reducing mass incarceration that was signed into law by President Donald Trump last year.\n\nHow much money has Cory Booker raised?\n\nBooker's campaign said it raised $5 million over the course of February and March, and over $6.1 million in cash on hand.\n\nBooker raised $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nHow is Cory Booker viewed by voters compared to the competition?\n\nINSIDER has conducted a number of other polls to check in on how these candidates are perceived in comparison to one another. When we asked respondents to one poll to rank how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates, Booker was generally considered to be one the third-most left-leaning candidates in the field. Booker was among the more experienced candidates int the field by far when we asked respondents to rank the candidates based on how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. And when asked how likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be, Booker was in the top half og candidates.\n\nCould Cory Booker beat President Trump?\n\nReferring back to INSIDER's recurring poll, Cory Booker overall is believed to be a fairly ordinary candidate in a general election against Donald Trump compared to the whole field. Booker is essentially right on the money when it comes to his perceived perform acne against Trump compared to the general Democratic average.\n\nHow do Democratic voters feel about Cory Booker's qualifications?\n\nINSIDER has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications. We asked respondents about a list of possible qualifications and if they made them more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate for president.\n\nFor example, among respondents who said they'd vote in the Democratic primary, 19% said a candidate being a college professor made them likelier to support them, while 4% said it made them less likely to, for a +15% net favorability. We can then see how different candidates' resumes stack up compared to those preferences.\n\nAttributes perceived as most valuable include his released tax returns (+43%), position in the Senate (+40%), past as an activist (+28%), that he is multi-lingual (+25%), age 50 or younger (+23%), a Rhodes scholar (+12%) with an Ivy league education (+7%) and a lawyer (+3%).\n\nAttributes considered to be a liability based on the preferences of self-reported Democratic voters include that he grew up wealthy (-42%).", "description": "Sen.
