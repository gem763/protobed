But Trump had congratulated then-President Barack Obama in May 2011 when he announced the raid that killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nI want to personally congratulate President Obama and the men women of the Armed Forces for a job very well (cont) http://tl.gd/a7dhom \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2011\n\nTrump\u2019s full statement emphasized the need to put country ahead of party as the nation celebrated, as follows:\n\nI want to personally congratulate President Obama and the men [and] women of the Armed Forces for a job very well done. I am so proud to see Americans standing shoulder to shoulder, waving the American flag in celebration of this great victory. We should spend the next several days not debating party politics, but in remembrance of those who lost their lives on 9/11 and those fighting for our freedom. God Bless America.\n\nMoreover, Trump congratulated Obama even though the president had infamously mocked him mercilessly just hours before the raid, at the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner (WHCD). Obama said on that occasion:\n\nAnd I know just the guy to do it -\u2013 Donald Trump is here tonight! (Laughter and applause.) Now, I know that he\u2019s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald. (Laughter.) And that\u2019s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter \u2013- like, did we fake the moon landing? (Laughter.) What really happened in Roswell? (Laughter.) And where are Biggie and Tupac? (Laughter and applause.) But all kidding aside, obviously, we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience. (Laughter.) For example \u2014 no, seriously, just recently, in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 at the steakhouse, the men\u2019s cooking team cooking did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. And there was a lot of blame to go around. But you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership. And so ultimately, you didn\u2019t blame Lil\u2019 Jon or Meatloaf. (Laughter.) You fired Gary Busey. (Laughter.) And these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night. (Laughter and applause.) Well handled, sir. (Laughter.) Well handled. Say what you will about Mr. Trump, he certainly would bring some change to the White House. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got up there. (Laughter.) (Screens show \u201cTrump White House Resort and Casino.\u201d)\n\nOther Republicans were generous to Obama, too, putting patriotism ahead of politics.\n\nAs the New York Times noted:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama drew praise from unlikely quarters on Monday for pursuing a risky and clandestine mission to kill Osama bin Laden, a successful operation that interrupted the withering Republican criticism about his foreign policy, world view and his grasp of the office. Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared, \u201cThe administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation.\u201d New York\u2019s former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, \u201cI admire the courage of the president.\u201d And Donald J. Trump declared, \u201cI want to personally congratulate President Obama.\u201d\n\nThe Times observed that Republicans praised Obama even though it was clear the raid would help him politically.\n\nLater in 2011 and 2012, Trump walked back his praise for Obama somewhat:\n\nObama deserves much less credit for the killing of Bin Laden. The praise goes to our brave military and intelligence officers. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2012\n\nStop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2012\n\nAs of Sunday morning, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro had congratulated U.S. forces while pointedly excluding President Trump from their congratulations.\n\nJoel B.
