REUTERS/Tom Jacobs/Files\n\nHere are quotes and information about the three-day hearing:\n\nWHY IS THERE A HEARING?\n\nBritain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31. Yet parliament, where Johnson does not have a majority, remains divided over how and whether that should happen without an agreed divorce deal with the 27 other bloc members.\n\nJohnson obtained Queen Elizabeth\u2019s approval to suspend parliament for five weeks until Oct. 14, saying that was necessary for him to introduce a new legislative agenda. Opponents, however, say the reason was to prevent scrutiny of and challenges to his Brexit plans by lawmakers.\n\nWHO IS INVOLVED?\n\nTwo separate legal cases about the dispute, handled by lower courts, resulted in conflicting rulings which the Supreme Court is looking at together.\n\nIn one, businesswoman and anti-Brexit activist Gina Miller asserted that suspending parliament was an abuse of power by Johnson, and lost. In the other, Scottish member of parliament Joanna Cherry put forward similar arguments, and won.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear from lawyers for Miller, Cherry and the government, as well as other interested parties.\n\nThe case will be heard by all 11 Supreme Court justices, led by their president, Brenda Hale. Its ruling is final.\n\nTIMETABLE\n\nTuesday: Lawyers for Miller, against the prime minister. Then lawyers for the government, against Cherry.\n\nWednesday: Lawyers for the prime minister, against Miller. Then lawyers for Cherry, against the government.\n\nThursday: Lawyers for other parties. Then final submissions by lawyers for the government and for Miller.\n\nWHEN WILL A RULING COME?\n\nThe earliest would be late on Thursday, but it is more likely in the following days.\n\nKEY QUOTES\n\nBRENDA HALE, PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT, IN HER INTRODUCTION:\n\n\u201cThat this is a serious and difficult question of law is amply demonstrated by the fact that three senior judges in Scotland have reached a different conclusion from three senior judges in England and Wales.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not concerned with the wider political issues which form the context for this legal issue ... The determination of this legal issue will not determine when and how the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.\u201d\n\nPeople protest outside the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to prorogue parliament, in London, Britain September 17, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nDAVID PANNICK, LAWYER FOR GINA MILLER:\n\n\u201cThe prime minister advised Her Majesty to prorogue parliament for a period as long as five weeks because he, the prime minister, wished to avoid what he saw as the risk that parliament during that period would take action to frustrate or to damage the policies of his government.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder our system of constitutional law, parliament is sovereign, and the executive is accountable to parliament. For the executive to use a prorogative power to seek to evade control by parliament stands the basic principles of constitutional law on their head.\u201d", "description": "Britain's Supreme Court began hearing arguments on Tuesday about whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to Brexit was illegal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430796025&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0P7", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
