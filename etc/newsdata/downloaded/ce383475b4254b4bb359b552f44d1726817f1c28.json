Tulsi Gabbard is a \"Russian asset,\" and said that if the Hawaiian Democrat isn't an agent, she could be a \"useful idiot\" for the Kremlin.\n\nThe audience laughed when Behar compared Gabbard's gullibility to Trump's. Behar went on to say that she does not believe Clinton is eyeing a 2020 run, nor does she believe that Gabbard is \u201can agent.\u201d\n\nBut Behar pointed out that Gabbard did not flatly deny Clinton\u2019s charge and instead got defensive, calling the former secretary of state a \u201cwarmonger.\u201d\n\nClinton has been criticized over the \"asset\" comment by both Republicans and Democrats. Some see the provocative comment as an attempt by the former first lady to inject herself-- even if just on the periphery-- into the race; others see Clinton as a formidable statesman whose opinions matter.\n\nClinton also asserted, also without evidence, that Russians were \"grooming\u201d Gabbard to be \u201cthe third-party candidate\" and spoiler.\n\nGabbard reiterated to reporters Monday that she would commit to voting for the Democrats' eventual nominee, and would not run as a third-party candidate.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresident Trump on Monday told reporters that Clinton is \u201caccusing everyone of being a Russian agent.\"\n\n\u201cThese people are sick,\" he said. \"There\u2019s something wrong with them.\"\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report", "description": "Joy Behar, one of the co-hosts on \u201cThe View,\u201d talked about the recent controversy over\u00a0Hillary Clinton's suggestion that Rep.
