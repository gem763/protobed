This one is in many ways the most high-end entry yet, although that depends on how you feel about notches.\n\nSpec-wise, this device is very similar to sister company OnePlus\u2019 excellent new 7T. There\u2019s a Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, a 20:9 6.5-inch 1080p display with a small waterdrop notch and a 90Hz refresh rate, and a camera system built around Sony\u2019s ubiquitous 48-megapixel IMX586 sensor.\n\nThe Reno Ace gains an extra fourth camera with a monochrome sensor, however, and comes with up to 12GB of RAM. The Reno 10x Zoom, with its notchless display, \u201cshark fin\u201d pop-up selfie camera, and periscope telephoto lens, could still be considered the top-end Reno if you\u2019d value its features over the faster processor and screen in the Ace.\n\nTwo hours of usage from a five-minute charge\n\nThe Ace\u2019s truly unique feature is its breakthrough fast charging. Oppo was already the leader here with its Lamborghini-edition Find X, but the Reno Ace\u2019s 65W SuperVOOC steps it up further. The phone\u2019s 4,000mAh dual-cell battery can be charged from 0 to 100 percent in 30 minutes, according to Oppo, allowing for two hours of usage from just a five-minute charge.\n\nXiaomi and Vivo have both shown off faster ways to charge a 4,000mAh battery, but neither have actually shipped products that make use of the tech. Oppo also says the Reno Ace\u2019s 65W charger is the smallest on the market thanks to GaN technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to test those claims for ourselves, of course. The Reno Ace does also support both USB-C Power Delivery and Qualcomm\u2019s Quick Charge at 18W for times when you don\u2019t have Oppo\u2019s proprietary charger and cable, which is good news given that Google now mandates standard fast-charge tech for all Android phones.\n\nThe Reno Ace is coming to China first. Pricing is yet to be announced.", "description": "Oppo has announced the latest phone in its increasingly diversified Reno range of flagship phones, the Reno Ace.
