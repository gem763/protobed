The documentary will also be shown at his exhibition in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana.\n\nLocals gathered to view the sculpture, which is located near Melania Trump's hometown of Sevnica.

All the more reason to make the statue. Being born the same year, the same month. She might come and see the thing. She might like it.\"\n\nMaxi acknowledges the sharp divergence of his and Melania's lives, despite the fact they came from the same humble roots. \"Let's face it, she owns half of America while I have nothing,\" he says.\n\nNadia Pilchowski, a curator at the gallery, notes that the film offers a \"personal portrait of Maxi and his thoughts about Slovenia, the USA, Europe, immigration and class division.\"\n\n\"Through these interviews the film attempts to capture the spirit of Slovenia, which seems to be mirrored in Maxi's interactions with his family, environment and his feelings about art, God, love and country,\" she writes in a foreword to the exhibition.\n\n\"By focusing on one working class man's portrayal of a public and internationally known personality, the film offers insights on local and global problems and policies illuminated by the USA and Europe and beyond.\"\n\nThe local chainsaw sculptor who created the work was born in the same month, year and hospital as Melania Trump.

He noted that it was a \"blatant contradiction\" to have a president, who has made halting immigration a cornerstone of his presidency, married to an immigrant whose first language is not English.\n\nHe also claimed that the work is the first monument in the world dedicated to this first lady.\n\nThe pale blue wraparound outfit mirrors the one she wore to the inauguration of her husband in 2017.
