THE POUCH BAG\n\nEver since then-unknown British designer Daniel Lee took the reins as creative director for Italian label Bottega Veneta in June 2018, the heritage brand has become the designer of the moment among millennial fashionistas.\n\nKnown for fine leather handbags and accessories, Bottega's crowning glory under Lee is The Pouch, an over-sized clutch that has been seen under the arms of major celebrities like models Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Lily Aldridge.\n\nThe Pouch comes in a rainbow of colours, including electric blue, neon green and white, but at $3,730 it's sure to blow more than year's sartorial budget for us mere mortals.\n\nSpanish-based fast fashion brand Zara stock a more reasonably priced quilted bag for $45.95.\n\nWhat are the biggest fashion trends for summer 2019? - Bike shorts with blazers - Animal print, specifically leopard and snake - Brightly coloured boiler suits - Lilac and lavender tones - 1980s inspired puff shoulders Sources: TrendSpotter and StyleCaster\n\nWhat are the biggest fashion trends for summer 2019? - Tartan skirts and blazers - 1990s bucket hats - Mini-bags - Silk tie dye dresses and tops - Sheer fabric - Neon colour tones Sources: TrendSpotter and StyleCaster\n\n\n\n\n\n2. THE STRAPPY SANDAL\n\nAnother trend taking Australia by storm this summer is the strappy square-toe sandal, specifically in white or bright colours like red or baby blue.\n\nInvesting in the 'Paris' red-hot leather sandals from French fashion favourite Saint Laurent will cost you $1,215, but a strikingly similar pair of Inika lace-up heels from Australian footwear brand Alias Mae will only set you back $189.95.\n\nAlso dominating the streets during international fashion weeks last month were Bottega Veneta's $1,220 quilted leather mules, but Alias Mae have you covered with their newly released $199.95 Leni mules.\n\nStrappy square-toe sandals like these $1,125 heels from Saint Laurent (left) are taking the Australian fashion scene by storm, but homegrown footwear label Alias Mae have you covered with remarkably similar lace-ups for $189.95 (right)\n\nThese $1,220 quilted mules from Bottega Veneta dominated international fashion weeks earlier this year, but Alias Mae nailed it again with these newly released $199.95 slip-ons\n\n3. THE MINI SLIP DRESS\n\nHailed as 'the ultimate cool-girl label', Australian clothing brand Realisation Par has dominated the fashion scene Down Under ever since launching in 2015.\n\nThe label is known for its floating, feminine silhouettes, retro summer prints and silk fabric.\n\nFan favourite The Inez, a $265 drawstring mini-dress dotted with a strawberry print, is sure to be seen on the sands of Bondi and Coogee this summer, but Australian fast fashion label Glassons has a very similar number for just $39.99.\n\nAustralian label Realisation Par is known for effortlessly cool silk slip dresses, including the ever-popular $265 'Inez' (left), but it's hard to pass this dupe from fast fashion retailer Glassons which costs just $39.99 (right)\n\n4. THE INITIAL NECKLACE\n\nFirst popularised by French luxury label Celine under renowned creative director Phoebe Philo, alphabet necklaces remain one of the must-have accessories for 2019.\n\nSince Philo's departure early last year, it has become practically impossible to find an original Celine pendant, but the brand recently released an updated version for $650.\n\nIf that price tag is beyond your budget, Australian jewellery label Kitte has replicated Celine's original design for just $129.\n\nKitte initial necklaces are currently reduced to $96 on The Iconic.\n\nNecklaces like this Celine piece (left) will set you back $650, but if you don't fancy a splurge, Australian label Kitte make alphabet chains for $129 (right)\n\n5. THE SHOULDER-TIE TOP\n\nStatement shoulders are big news for summer Down Under, especially when teamed with a sexy bodysuit or bustier.\n\nLos Angeles-based label For Love and Lemons stock a range of seductive pieces, including the $213 forest green, polka dot Paula Bustier, which has been seen on the Instagram feeds of influencers like model Michelle Randolph.\n\nTrendy Australian label Lioness have excellent dupes for a fraction of the price.\n\nThe brand's 'Boo'd Up' top in pink leopard print is currently reduced to $31.60 on The Iconic.", "description": "Australian fast fashion retailers have released new styles for the summer season, and many bear a striking resemblance to luxury designer looks - without the eye-watering price tags.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/01/20262614-0-image-a-58_1572225395474.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
