Schiff (D-Calif.) told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be trying to schedule hearings, witness interviews. We\u2019ll be working on subpoenas and document requests. We\u2019ll be busy.\u201d\n\nThe House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs panels also announced Friday that they have scheduled five depositions beginning with State Department officials who would have knowledge of Trump\u2019s engagements with Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats are working against an unofficial deadline of the end of the year to complete impeachment proceedings that currently focus on Trump\u2019s request for \u201ca favor\u201d during a July telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cThe speaker has made it very clear that we are not to let momentum drop in these two weeks,\u201d said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.).\n\nDemocrats are treating a whistleblower complaint surrounding Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky as a \u201croad map\u201d for their probe, looking to the account of how White House officials were alarmed by the call and allegedly sought to improperly keep its contents secret.\n\nAt issue is Trump\u2019s pressing Zelensky on the call to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukrainians worked with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nTrump spent Friday railing against the impeachment effort as a dangerous partisan \u201cWitch Hunt!\u201d while maintaining that he had said nothing wrong in his call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cIf that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn\u2019t considered appropriate, then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe president and his allies also continued to try to undermine the credibility of the whistleblower, whose identity has not been publicly released.\n\nTrump speculated Friday morning on Twitter that the whistleblower might have received information from \u201ca leaker or spy\u201d or a \u201cpartisan operative.\u201d He offered no evidence for his suggestions.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign announced Friday that it will launch a television ad \u201chighlighting Joe Biden\u2019s Ukraine scandal and the Democrats\u2019 plan to use it to steal the 2020 election by impeaching the President.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have mostly lined up to support Trump, echoing his claim that the call was \u201cperfect\u201d and that his willingness to release both a transcript of it and a version of the whistleblower complaint serve to show he has nothing to hide.\n\nBut there is unease, as suggested by a previously unreported intercession by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nTwo people familiar with the conversation said McConnell told the White House earlier this week that Trump needed to release the transcript of his call to bolster the claim that the conversation was not improper because the speculation about what happened was becoming politically untenable.\n\nNeither the White House nor McConnell\u2019s office provided comment on that communication.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 inquiry, though on a tight schedule, is potentially broad. The whistleblower\u2019s letter indicates that approximately a dozen White House officials listened in on the July call between Trump and Zelensky, and that \u201cmultiple\u201d intelligence and diplomatic officials were briefed on its contents.\n\nThe complaint also highlights the role played by Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the State Department officials who reportedly advised the Ukrainians on how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands.\n\nLawmakers are seeking to depose or interview several of those officials and are also interested in learning what other transcripts of Trump\u2019s communications might have been moved to a secure server for political protection, as the whistleblower alleges.\n\nThe subpoena issued Friday demands that Pompeo turn over by Oct. 4 documents pertaining to Trump\u2019s dealings with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cYour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry,\u201d Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) wrote in a joint letter to Pompeo.\n\nIn addition, the House Intelligence Committee will hold a closed briefing with the inspector general of the intelligence community Oct. 4. The IG conducted a preliminary investigation and determined that the whistleblower complaint was credible.\n\n\u201cWe will move as expeditiously as possible, but we have to see what witnesses are going to make themselves available and what witnesses are going to require compulsion,\u201d Schiff said Friday.\n\nAmong the State Department officials the committee is seeking to depose are Kurt Volker, a former ambassador who has worked for Pompeo as an envoy on Ukraine issues, and Marie Yovanovitch, a Foreign Service officer who this year was recalled early from her post as ambassador to Ukraine and has been criticized by Trump. Volker resigned from his State Department post Friday, as first reported by the State Press newspaper at Arizona State University.\n\nThe move by the House committee chairmen brought the State Department fully within Congress\u2019s sights in the impeachment drama, a place that Pompeo has assiduously tried this week to avoid. In public appearances at the United Nations General Assembly, which he attended with Trump, Pompeo brushed aside reporters\u2019 questions on the role the State Department played in the Ukraine affair. He is to leave Monday for a week-long diplomatic trip to Europe.\n\nThe committees demanded Pompeo\u2019s appearance on Capitol Hill and listed questions they want answered about his knowledge of the activities of Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, and whether the State Department assisted Giuliani in any way \u2014 as Giuliani has asserted \u2014 in pushing Trump\u2019s demands with Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe chairmen also asked about the activities of Volker and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, both of whom met with Zelensky the day after the July telephone call.\n\nRep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), another member of the Intelligence Committee, said next steps will include speaking with the whistleblower, officials who listened in on the phone call and Giuliani.\n\n\u201cI think that we are going to want to interview people that were engaged in what is clearly a scheme. This is not a one-off. This is not just a phone call. This is a scheme that was hatched some time ago, and you can see evidence of it dating back to 2018,\u201d Speier said. \u201cAnd I want to see us come up with that timeline, because this is a truly corrupt undertaking.\u201d\n\nSeparately, two powerful committees that oversee the federal budget and spending have requested from the White House a timeline and relevant documents that explain how the United States came to withhold almost $4oo million of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nCentral to the committees\u2019 concerns are reports that the White House Office of Management and Budget was responsible for relaying to the State Department and the Pentagon the president\u2019s order to hold back the aid to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAs reports continue to emerge, we have deepening concerns that OMB continues to demonstrate a pattern of impeding agencies\u2019 ability to use their enacted appropriations,\u201d wrote House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) and House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), in a joint letter to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and OMB acting director Russell Vought.\n\nKaren DeYoung, Colby Itkowitz and John Wagner contributed to this report.", "description": "Democrats are working against an unofficial deadline of the end of the year to complete impeachment proceedings that currently focus on Trump\u2019s request for \u2018a favor\u2019 during a July telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Anne Gearan", "White House Reporter", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Ashley Parker", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/btAHM66QzGQ1chnT7GbIc4yXcz4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MWOT7SXAUQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
