Biden, while the president has said it was a \u201cperfect\u201d phone call.\n\n\u201cAnd when it\u2019s only down party lines and Democrats from day one have refused to work with this president, I think Americans are saying enough is enough \u2014 why don\u2019t you get to the negotiating table and work on our behalf instead of trying to negate the votes of 63 million Americans?\u201d she said.\n\nSupport for impeachment has ticked up in recent polling, but Americans are still intensely divided over the subject.\n\nMs. McDaniel also touted the $125 million the Trump campaign and the RNC combined to raise in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s double where Obama was heading into his reelection \u2014 dollars are the polls right now,\u201d she said.\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who leads the way in third-quarter fundraising among the 2020 Democratic contenders thus far, raised $25.3 million.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
