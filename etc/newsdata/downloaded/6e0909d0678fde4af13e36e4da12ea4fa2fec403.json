This begins with a Standard Twin ranging up to the Premier Grand Suite Twin. The description for the latter reads: 'our Club Floor Premier Grand Suite is the most prestigious relaxation and comfort with its rooms and the Club Lounge'.\n\nTo stay there as of today (Wednesday, October 30) for one person and for one night ranges considerably in price. The aforementioned Standard Twin room starts from \u00a3214.76 and rises to \u00a3235.28 - which includes bed and breakfast. If you're looking for luxury though, the Premier Grand Suite Twin will set you back \u00a3723.49 with or without the breakfast option.\n\nEngland are currently staying at the Keio Plaza Hotel in Shinjuku, Tokyo ahead of the final\n\nRooms vary in price from \u00a3214.76 to \u00a3723.49 for one person and for one night\n\nEngland, of course, will be set up with their own nutritionists and backroom staff to make sure they are well-fuelled for the final away from the breakfast buffet.\n\nBut this weekend, with the big event in Yokohama, prices unsurprisingly rise. If two people wished to stay at the Keio Plaza this weekend for two nights (Friday to Sunday) then there is only one room available on offer via Booking.com.\n\nThat is the Premier Grand Suite Twin and will cost \u00a32,366 overall. On your own? There\u2019s a discount \u2013 but it\u2019s only \u00a318, leaving the cost at \u00a32,348.\n\nFor the Argentina game, England arrived here on September 29 and eventually checked out on October 10. Later on it turned out to be a pretty good base for South Africa, too, as they edged past Wales 19-16 in the second semi-final on Sunday.\n\nSouth Africa are now staying at the Tokyo Bay Hotel, close to Disneyland.\n\nThere are 11 different restaurants on offer ranging from Japanese food to French and Italian\n\nTo stay there this weekend (Friday to Sunday) will cost \u00a32,366 overall between two people\n\nEngland stayed at the Keio Plaza Hotel in the build-up to their 39-10 Pool A win over Argentina\n\nGuests at the Keio Plaza have access to 28 facilities on offer at the plush hotel. These include a sky swimming pool on the seventh floor of the main tower (which is only open during the summer months), a fitness room which boasts treadmills, cross trainers and free dumbbells - to name a few - as well as three shopping centres.\n\nThere are a variety of options to unwind as well. An in-room Shiatsu massage between midday to 2am is available for between \u00a328.55 (a 30-minute partial body massage) to \u00a3178.45 (a 100-minute Japanese Authentic Massage using Japanese aroma oil).\n\nMeanwhile on the third floor of the main tower lobby there is a Reflexology room open between 11am to 9pm and an Esthetic Salon on the eighth floor of the South Tower complex.\n\nA general view looking out of the Keio Plaza Hotel - which was used in two Godzilla films\n\nSouth Africa stayed at Keio Plaza Hotel prior to their 19-16 win over Wales in the semi-finals\n\nWhile all of these options sound luxurious, England have a vast medical team of their own to look after their stars leading up to the final.\n\nIn total there are 11 restaurants listed on the Keio Plaza\u2019s website. These include Japanese cuisine, Kaiseki cuisine, Teppan-taki, Tempura and Sushi. There are also French and Italian offerings if someone fancies a break from Asian food.\n\nLocal transport links are good \u2013 but England needn\u2019t worry about that. Their main focus will be the trip to the ground\u2026 Yokohama\u2019s International Stadium is a 23-minute drive away. Jones and his team are now counting down the hours.\n\nKaiseki cuisine, Teppan-taki, Tempura and Sushi is also on offer at the luxurious hotel", "description": "We're just days away from the conclusion of a fantastic 2019 Rugby World Cup.
