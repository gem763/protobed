More recently, annual Twitter videos made it a viral sensation.\n\nWhy the 21st? \u201cWe went through all the dates: \u2018Do you remember the first, the second, the third, the fourth \u2026\u2019 and the one that just felt the best was the 21st,\u201d Allee Willis, one of the song\u2019s writers, told NPR. \u201cThere is no significance beyond it just sang better than any of the other dates.\u201d\n\nOh, and what does \u201cba-dee-ya\u201d really mean? It was a placeholder lyric that the band\u2019s leader, Maurice Wright, opted to keep in the song: a lesson to Ms. Willis to \u201cnever let the lyric get in the way of the groove.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it for this briefing. And a correction: Thursday\u2019s briefing misspelled the surname of a filmmaker. He is Miki Dezaki, not Dizaki. Have a groovy weekend. \u2014 Alisha\n\nThank you\n\nMark Josephson, Eleanor Stanford and Chris Harcum provided the break from the news.
