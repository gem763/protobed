During 16 years as leader of the AFL-CIO (1979-1995), Kirkland gave crucial support, both material and moral, to Lech Walesa and the Solidarity movement in Poland, where it was an early tremor in the political earthquake that ended European communism. Here, in this island city at the other end of the Eurasian landmass, a city that has become a flash point in Cold War 2.0, Lee is lending support to a fluid, shape-shifting protest movement that has no Walesa.\n\nThis lack is a strength and a weakness. The movement has no leader with whom the local government, which is an appendage of Beijing \u2014 and, hence, of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 might negotiate. Fortunately, however, a movement without a head cannot be easily decapitated, which otherwise probably would be Beijing\u2019s default position.\n\nThis thought experiment became the premise of a 2018 novel (Chloe Benjamin\u2019s \u201cThe Immortalists \u201d): If you knew when you were going to die, how would this change how you choose to live? Hong Kong\u2019s young people, from whom come most of the demonstrations\u2019 participants and energy, know that the clock is ticking for their city. It is 22 years into what was supposed to be a 50-year grace period. In 1997, Britain ended 156 years of responsibility for Hong Kong, transferring it to China.\n\nSo, just eight years after the Tiananmen massacre, there began what was supposed to be half a century of Hong Kong\u2019s exceptionalism preserved, after which the city might be gracefully melded with a mellowed mainland. Just 22 years later, this hope has been as refuted as the 1989 hope that the massacre would be followed by a less authoritarian, because more secure, Beijing regime.\n\nLee was in a hotel overlooking Tiananmen Square when the tanks rolled in. He later organized Hong Kong\u2019s memorial museum, which is overseen by the same organization that facilitates commemorations every June 4. As a human bridge between the first Cold War and the next one, he knows that this city today is not like East Berlin in 1953, or Budapest in 1956, or Prague in 1968. In those places, people who were in despotism\u2019s firm grip rebelled and quickly learned how firm the grip was. Hong Kong is spectacularly vibrant and prosperous because it perennially \u2014 since 1970 \u2014 holds the top position in the Economic Freedom of the World Index rankings.\n\nWhen demonstrators here have waved colonial-era flags and shouted, \u201cReclaim Hong Kong,\u201d they were not nostalgic for colonial restoration. Rather, this was largely a cry for the status quo.\n\nLargely, until now. Now, however, less and less. As a young woman from Hong Kong studying in Boston recently wrote in her college newspaper, \u201cI am from a city owned by a country that I don\u2019t belong to.\u201d Residents of this city, especially young residents, are decreasingly likely to think of themselves as Chinese rather than as Hong Kongers. In 1997, 47 percent of residents were \u201cproud to be a citizen of China.\u201d Now only 38 percent are. Among those ages 18 to 29, 55 percent have a negative opinion of the Beijing regime, which has sown discord and is reaping disaffection.\n\nThe U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 commits the United States, as the State Department notes, to \u201cpromote Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity, autonomy, and way of life.\u201d Its \u201cway of life\u201d is a multifaceted condition that rests on freedom and universal suffrage. A recent Hong Kong demonstration called for passage by the U.S. Congress of legislation that would impose sanctions on mainland Chinese or Hong Kong officials who abridge the city\u2019s freedoms, and it would require annual review of the special economic privileges Hong Kong gets from the United States. This would make U.S. relations with Hong Kong more like those with Taiwan, which receives substantial U.S. military and other assistance to buttress its independence, even as U.S. policy adheres to the prudential fiction that Taiwan is something it currently is not and probably won\u2019t ever be (part of \u201cone China \u201d).\n\nBut Hong Kong could become yet another casualty of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, which made many Americans comprehensively skeptical of U.S. attempts, in the words of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s inaugural address, \u201cto assure the survival and the success of liberty\u201d around the world. Hong Kong, however, unlike Iraq, has a vibrant democratic culture and civil society. What is required of U.S. policy is not \u201cnation building\u201d but sustaining the reality of a polity that, without claiming or seeking nationhood, simply refuses to be absorbed into the domain of an increasingly nasty regime.\n\nRead more from George F.
