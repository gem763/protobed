Given subject\u2019s behavior in facilitating victim\u2019s death, release (is) not compatible w(ith) best interest of society.\u201d\n\nMichelle Carter and her boyfriend Conrad Roy were aged 17 and 18 respectively at the time of his death on July 13, 2014.\n\nThey were in a long distance relationship, and he confided in her about abuse as well as ongoing mental health matters and suicide attempts.\n\nThough she had previously urged him to seek professional help, a court found that she \u201cwantonly and recklessly\u201d assisted his suicide via a series of messages sent the day he died.\n\nAlthough she has been denied parole, Carter will likely be released early, as she has been a \u201cmodel prisoner\u201d, working while in jail and attending educational programs.\n\nInmates in Bristol County can earn ten days a month off their sentence for this type of good behaviour, and as it stands, Carter will be due for release in March instead of May next year.", "description": "Michelle Carter, who was jailed after encouraging her boyfriend's suicide via text, has been denied parole, but will likely still be released early.", "authors": ["Alasdair Duncan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/MichelleCarterSuicideBoyfriendFB.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
