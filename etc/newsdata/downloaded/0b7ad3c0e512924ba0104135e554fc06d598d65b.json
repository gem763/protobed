Soon, he couldn't move at all, and could barely breathe without the help of a respirator.\n\nEventually, the symptoms subsided and the boy is now a healthy nine-year-old.\n\nBut because so little is known about AFM, Dr Bove still lives in fear that some as-of-yet-unknown long-term complications could rear their head at any moment.\n\nThe polio-like disease that sickened at least 233 US children last year, leaving many temporarily paralyzed.\n\nAnd it could make a return this fall the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned in July.\n\nDoctors must be on high alert for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), the mysterious disease that rears its head every two years, typically between August and December.\n\nThis year, 2019, should be an off year.\n\nYet the CDC was concerned enough to release a study and advisory to urge parents, and especially physicians, to take children's limb weakness seriously and act fast.\n\nAlthough there were a handful of cases of the already rare disease the following year, AFM seemed to subside in 2015.\n\nBut it was back again in 2016, sickening even more people - 149 - than the first recognized outbreak had.\n\nAnd last year was the worst yet for AFM.\n\nIn total, 590 cases of the rare disease have been confirmed since it was first recognized in 2014.\n\nMost people with AFM have accompanying symptoms of viral respiratory infections, such as congestion, coughing, runny nose and fever.\n\nTesting samples from these patients has helped doctors begin to whittle away at the list of potential culprits.\n\nWHAT IS ACUTE FLACCID MYELITIS? Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), of which acute flaccid paralysis is believed to be an effect, is a rare and poorly-understood but serious condition. The condition is thought to be caused by viruses such as enteroviruses which infect the brain or spinal cord and cause nerve damage. Viruses believed to trigger the condition usually only cause mild flu-like symptoms but can trigger the more serious AFM. Symptoms include facial droop/weakness, difficulty moving the eyes, drooping eyelids, or difficulty with swallowing or slurred speech. Patients may also have cold-like symptoms or a fever. Because its causes are unclear there is no standard treatment for AFM and therapy is usually given on a case-by-case basis. There are usually only a 'handful' of cases in England each year, while the US tends to go through a two-yearly cycle in which there will be a year with only two dozen or so cases then the next year will be over 100. The virus Enterovirus D68 is believed to be linked to the infection and has been found in patients in both the US and UK.\n\nSeveral kind of enteroviruses - which cause respiratory infections - have been linked to AFM cases, but there's not enough hard, consistent evidence to establish that these are the cause of the disease.\n\nThe first suspect was EV-D68, which was linked to 2012 AFM case that predated the CDC's recognition of the disease.\n\nAbout 90 percent of people what developed AFM had some sort of respiratory infection, but not all of them had EV-D86. They didn't all even test positive for a known enterovirus.\n\nIn attempts to prove that the virus might be the cause, physicians tested cerebrospinal fluid from the spines of AFM patients for evidence of the virus, which they surmised must be getting into this region and wreaking havoc.\n\n'People were hung up on the fact that enteroviruses were rarely detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of AFM patients,' said Dr Michael Wilson, the new study's senior author and a professor of neurology at UCSF.\n\n'They wanted to know how someone could get neurologic symptoms with no virus detectable in their central nervous system.\n\n'If we could detect something specific to a virus in in the spinal fluid of AFM patients, we would feel more secure claiming that the neurologic symptoms of the disease are virally mediated.'\n\nHe and his team started their own search the way so many others had: by trying - and failing - to find any traces of the virus itself in the spinal fluid they took from patients.\n\nInstead, they decided to try a new method of testing to look not for signs of the virus itself, but for signs of the patients' immune systems' responses to enteroviruses.\n\nTo double-down on the certainty of the conclusions they could draw from those tests, the research team compiled a library of proteins from every single virus known to infect humans, animals, ticks and mosquitoes.\n\nWhen they exposed these to the spinal fluid samples taken from 42 children diagnosed with AFM.\n\nNearly 70 percent of the samples had antibody responses to the enteroviruses - and not to any of the other viruses.\n\nAfter last year's record-setting caseload, the CDC has intensified its investigation into the disease, but the cause remains a mystery.\n\n'When there's an infection in the spinal cord, antibody-making immune cells travel there and make more antibodies. We think finding antibodies against enterovirus in the spinal fluid of AFM patients means the virus really does go to the spinal cord. This helps us lay the blame on these viruses,' explained Dr Ryan Schubert, lead author of the study.\n\nIt's a huge step in the right direction, but there are many unanswered questions in the study's wake.\n\nEnteroviruses sicken so many people with the common cold each year, it's hardly possible to say how many they strike.\n\nYet less percent of children that get colds from the virus develop AFM, and scientists are no closer to understanding why the virus's effects seem to be particular to young children in the first place.\n\nAnd perhaps most frustratingly, this evidence that the condition is caused by a virus means there's no treatment, as there are no antivirals to fight enteroviruses.\n\nThe CDC has taken the tact of reminding people to be on the look out for the signs of the disease, and continue to practice good hygiene to diminish the risks of transmission of all germs, including the ubiquitous viruses that trigger AFM.\n\n'Public health education is important, but it's not enough to prevent AFM,' Dr Bove said.\n\n'The virus is too common to avoid. A vaccine is the only way to meaningfully prevent the disease.'\n\nIf past patterns are any indicator, 2019 should offer a bit of a reprieve from cases of AFM.\n\nEven so, 2020 is just around the corner, on the timeline of vaccine development, especially, and if past trends continue, it could be the worst year yet for AFM.\n\n'We're all holding our breath for 2020,' Dr Schubert said.", "description": "Acute flaccid myelitis has left nearly 600 in the US - mostly children - with life-threatening paralysis.
