That review is taking place alongside Esper\u2019s effort.\n\nThe contract was previously expected to be awarded this summer, but prior to that, Republican lawmakers issued a series of dueling letters over the contract, some urging the Pentagon to award it quickly and others pressing for it to be stalled amid the allegations of bias.\n\nOracle, meanwhile, took the DOD to court over claims that the cloud computing procurement process was unfair and biased, though a federal judge dismissed those claims.", "description": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper will recuse himself from the Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion \"war cloud\" contract competition due to his son\u2019s employment with one of the companies that sought the deal, the Defense Department announced Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/espermark_080319getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
