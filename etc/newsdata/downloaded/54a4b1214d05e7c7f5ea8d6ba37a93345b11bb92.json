Today's star is the citrus fruit bergamot. So many health benefits from so little of its essential oil! Imagine that distant day in sunny Bergamo, Italy\u2026 \"Marcello, what is this unknown fruit?\" \"Hmmm\u2026he seems both a lemon and an orange.\" \"Such a lovely fragrance, Marcello. Let us squeeze him for his oil.\"\n\nBergamot: oil wellness\n\nAn analgesic\n\nA stimulant\n\nA diuretic\n\nAn antiseptic\n\nAn antidepressant\n\nA deodorant\n\nA tonic\n\nAn anti-spasmodic\n\nAn anti-fungal\n\nBergamot oil for instant gratification\n\nJust a few drops in your bath water helps reduce stress\n\nInhaling its lovely fragrance, which takes no drops at all, can give you an instant positive mental boost\n\nApplying a few drops can soothe insect bite irritation\n\nCombining a few drops with other digestion-friendly essential oils, like chamomile and fennel, for an abdominal massage that can relieve gas, indigestion, and flatulence\n\nMix a few drops with lavender, salt, and filtered water for a genital wash to prevent recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI)\n\n\"Ecco, Giovanni\u201d (Italian for OK!!).Talk about a versatile fixer-upper. The oil of this hybrid lemon-orange fruit\u2014an essential flavor element in Earl Grey or Lady Grey tea\u2014is a tiny treasure chest, highly effective in relieving digestive difficulties, reducing stress, healing infectious wounds, repelling insects, and even protecting crops. It's all this and more:As Giovanni suggested, squeezing the bergamot fruit for its oil is the way to go. Its flesh is bitter, though Italians make bergamot marmalade. Hand- or cold-pressing some 100 bergamot oranges gives us about three ounces of bergamot oil. But those three ounces go a long way, especially when you use only a few drops at a time, as with these simple applications:(FYI, to save you the trouble: 3 ounces = around 1,744 drops. Even at 10 drops per day, 3 ounces is about a six-month supply.)\n\nBergamot is much better than statins\n\nTripled risk of artery calcification, increasing the severity of heart disease\n\nDepletion of essential nutrients, including vital coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)\n\nErectile dysfunction\n\nMuscle pain that can become fatal\n\nLiver dysfunction and acute kidney failure\n\nIncreased risk of type 2 diabetes and elevated blood sugar levels\n\nCataracts\n\nSerious memory problems\n\nBergamot as serious medicine\n\nThe cholesterol-reducing drugs known as statins are used by some 25 percent of Americans over 45, making them the most widely prescribed drugs in the US. While statins do reduce some cholesterol in some patients, they come with:Bergamot is a much better way. New research has shown that it has statin-like molecular structures, and far more important, statin-like benefits\u2014without statins' terrible side effects.The various bacteria that cause UTIs, meningitis, and other serious infections\u2014some of which resist even potent antibiotics\u2014can be controlled by bergamot oil in the bath. As antibiotics are an overkill intervention that destroys both beneficial and harmful biome bacteria, bergamot instead is a double blessing. Bergamot's antibacterial power also takes on the symptoms of shingles, herpes, and chickenpox\u2014the cold sores, mouth ulcers, and genital lesions. A few drops applied topically on the affected area speeds up healing and prevents recurrence of painful symptoms.Italian researchers have proven that bergamot oil has potent antifungal properties when used as a topical remedy for candida fungus infections.\n\nBe oil well\n\nReferences\n\nFederici, C.T., Roose, M.L. and Scora, R.W.

Bergamot aromatherapy reduces anxiety, even for patients in the very anxious moments just before undergoing surgery. It also helps lift the cloud of depression and helps eliminate chronic fatigue syndrome.All up, bergamot has an impressive resume, packing a hearty and wide-ranging list of health benefits. Like most essential oils, it's powerful medicine. As always, consult with your doctor before trying something new and different. He or she should know that bergamot oil applied topically can increase sensitivity to direct sunlight, which can cause extreme sunburn. Play it safe and avoid sunlight for 72 hours after topical application. If you're taking photosensitizing drugs\u2014among them, Ciprofloxacin (Cipro), norfloxacin (Noroxin), lomefloxacin (Maxaquin), ofloxacin (Floxin), and levofloxacin (Levaquin)\u2014bergamot should be on your no-apply list. With those caveats, give bergamot a \"go.\"", "description": "When nature's gifts and our endless human curiosity meet up, .09/02/2019 2:59:15AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
