Four shooting victims were hospitalized there, one in critical condition.\n\nAll survived, as have all the more than 20 other wounded people taken to Dayton hospitals after the shooting early Aug. 4 in the city\u2019s Oregon entertainment district.\n\nEmergency room staffers at Miami Valley commented on how effectively police used tourniquets to stop bleeding, said Dr. Randy Marriott, an E.R. physician there and the medical director for the Dayton Fire Department.\n\n\u201cTo what extent that helped the outcome, we don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s another testament to how hard we\u2019ve trained in this area and that our law enforcement officers know how to stop bleeding,\u201d Marriott said.\n\nThere was a large-scale training exercise late last year involving hospitals, police and fire departments that helped police practice first aid in a mass casualty scenario, Marriott said.\n\nJust as many police across the country now carry the lifesaving opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone, many now carry first-aid kits for gunshot victims.\n\nThe few minutes before ambulances arrive are crucial for someone bleeding from gunshots, said Dr. Dustin Calhoun, a University of Cincinnati Medical Center emergency room physician and medical director for the Cincinnati Fire Department.\n\n\u201cIt can be life and death,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cBleeding can kill a patient in as fast as 3 minutes.\u201d\n\nWhitney Austin, shot 12 times in the Fifth Third Bank building attack in 2018 in downtown Cincinnati, has no doubt that officers\u2019 first aid saved her.\n\nRight after police fatally shot the gunman who killed three people, officers pulled her out of the revolving door where she fell, and Sgt. Kara Graves applied a tourniquet on her left arm.\n\nBy then, Austin\u2019s cream-colored shirt was drenched in crimson. She would need blood transfusions at UC Medical.\n\n\u201cQuickly applying a tourniquet and stopping the blood flow from my left arm was critical to my survival,\u201d Austin said.\n\nCincinnati police last year got departmentwide training through the UC Health system\u2019s Stop the Bleed program, which also offers free training to schools, businesses and other groups.\n\nA Cincinnati officer this month used his training to help save an armed man he had just shot in the chest.\n\nBlair expects some 1,000 police, fire and medical professionals to take part in active-shooter training seminars at a conference beginning Sunday in Aurora, Colorado, site of a 2012 movie theater shooting that killed 12 people and wounded 70.\n\nStudy of the response made it apparent that police, who usually get to the wounded first, need to get started as soon as possible transporting the most badly hurt.\n\nOrange County, Florida, Sheriff John Mina, who was Orlando police chief during the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting massacre, which killed 49 people and wounded dozens, said his officers knew they couldn\u2019t wait for enough ambulances to move all the wounded.\n\nPolice packed injured people into the back of an unmarked police pickup and made roundtrips to a nearby hospital. All of the injured survived.\n\n\u201cWe put so many people in it, it damaged the tailgate,\u201d Mina said. \u201cIt ended up saving their lives.\u201d\n\nDayton Police Maj. Chris Malson, a veteran SWAT commander and police academy training leader, said Dayton officers had visited other departments and attended national conferences for debriefs on responses to mass shooting that they then used to train for \u201cif it were to happen here in Dayton. \u2026 Unfortunately, it did happen.\u201d\n\nNow he and officials are preparing an analysis of their Aug. 4 response \u201cto see what changes and improvements can be made.\u201d\n\nAnd to share with other departments.\n\n__\n\nFollow Dan Sewell at https://www.twitter.com/dansewell\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When the blasting guns fell silent, the cries and groans of the wounded rose.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Sewell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/mass_shootings_police_medical_44827_c0-337-4032-2687_s1770x1032.jpg?9cd94d46bb0cc65df02073427140e6253a9a327b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
