We all said we never want to see another beetroot again.\"\n\nWhile a new October 31 departure date from the European Union provides another deadline for companies to brace for, their inventory building might well be less dramatic than in the first three months of the year. Hoarding for the original Brexit date in March helped the economy experience a growth spurt of 0.5%, before it shrank in the second quarter as businesses ran supplies down.\n\nThis time might be different. Companies are grappling with the possibility of yet another extension, leftover warehouse surpluses, the bitter experience and wastefulness of previous stockpiling, ongoing doubts about how to prepare, and simply fatigue with the whole process.\n\nThat weariness and uncertainty are taking a toll across the country. Business confidence has weakened and investment is in a deep slump.\n\nRaja\u2019s biggest worry now is access to citrus fruits, which are especially popular around Christmas, and to the exotic and out-of-season produce she needs to launch her range in a new chain of supermarkets early next year. She has stopped taking on new export contracts from the EU, awaiting greater clarity over costs of trade and the exchange rate.\n\nEven so, having only just offloaded the beetroot crisps she produced from the last round of hoarding, and with political chaos threatening to further delay to Brexit, she\u2019s \"umming and ahhing\" about whether to stockpile this time around. She probably won\u2019t.\n\n\n\nRowan Crozier, CEO of Birmingham-based metal pressing firm Brandaur, which produces components found in 90% of the world\u2019s electric kettles, says the stocks from March mostly remain in place. With a lead time of up to 50 weeks for materials, he\u2019s holding a third more than required in case Brexit disrupts supply lines, which is eating into his capital. At least, he notes wryly, it\u2019s all quite small, non-perishable and relatively simple to store.\n\nEven when goods are being freshly stockpiled, the data may not fully reflect the situation. At Brandaur, one customer - a German airbag manufacturer - built up stocks in March and is doing so again, but it doesn\u2019t have to pay until it actually uses the parts.\n\nMonitoring isn't easy\n\n\"Our hard-earned cash is sat in material stock which we need not be doing,\" says Crozier. \"Unfortunately we had to take a decision.\"\n\nTrying to keep track of the potential disruptions is the Bank of England\u2019s network of almost 30 agents around the country. But with the outlook so clouded, and decisions changing with the political situation day-to-day, monitoring isn\u2019t easy.\n\nGovernor Mark Carney told lawmakers in London this month that the central bank underestimated how much the economy would slow in the second quarter, largely because fewer businesses held on to non-perishable stocks than they expected.\n\nAt the same time, Chief Economist Andy Haldane added that \"a number have held the line and about a third plan holding more.\" There\u2019s also the issue of capacity, he said, as some firms need to store additional stock before the busy Christmas period and simply don\u2019t have space.\n\nThe latest survey by the BOE\u2019s agents showed a \"small boost\" to GDP from stock building was likely. The Confederation of British Industry\u2019s September survey showed firms are still building up supplies of finished goods.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s economists say\n\n\"We doubt the impact of stockpiling on the GDP figures will be as pronounced this time round. The surveys suggest the firms aren\u2019t building inventories to the same extent while the October deadline will mean the lift to output is spread across 3Q and 4Q. That said, the impact is still likely to be visible in the data and like 1H, make it difficult to judge the underlying pace of growth.\"\n\n- Dan Hanson, Bloomberg Economics\n\nWhile hard for economists, Britain\u2019s businesses are the ones facing the real challenges from Brexit. The latest political chaos isn\u2019t helping. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was found to have unlawfully suspended Parliament, and a month from the Brexit deadline, it\u2019s still not clear what will happen next.\n\n\"People aren\u2019t moaning about it, we\u2019re taking it on the chin,\" said Brandaur\u2019s Crozier. \"But when are we going to know where we\u2019re going?\"", "description": "To imagine the dilemma companies face when preparing for Brexit, think of 24 tons of beetroot.", "authors": ["Lucy Meakin"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7258/2ca97dc1ff77436389395e112f6affae.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
