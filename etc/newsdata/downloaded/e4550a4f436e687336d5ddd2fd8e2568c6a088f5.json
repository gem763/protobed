In July, the government deployed armed soldiers to assist police in controlling gang-related violence in Cape Town.\n\nThe government would only consider calling on the army in Gauteng if the police said they were not able to diffuse the situation, he said.\n\n\u201cThe job of the police is to police, and we know that the job of the army that is a very different job altogether. The army comes in to shoot down at the enemy,\u201d said Makhura. \u201cSo far the police are doing well.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, African governments warned citizens living in South Africa to take safety precautions and expressed frustration with latest wave of attacks targeting foreign-owned businesses in South Africa.\n\nThe Ethiopian Embassy in South Africa advised citizens to close their shops \u201cuntil peace is restored\u201d, according to Ethiopian media, and Zambia\u2019s Ministry of Transport and Communications warned Zambian truck drivers not to travel in to the country.\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said he has dispatched a Special Envoy to South Africa to convey his concerns to President Ramaphosa.\n\nBuhari\u2019s office said he had has also instructed the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, to summon the South African High Commissioner to Nigeria and get a brief on the situation; express Nigeria\u2019s displeasure over the treatment of its citizens and to get assurances of the safety of their lives and property.\n\nOnyeama called the violence \u201csickening\u201d on Twitter on Monday.\n\n__\n\nAP writer Sam Olukoya in Lagos, Nigeria contributed to this report.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "President Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned looting and arson attacks on foreign-owned businesses across Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria.", "authors": ["Krista Mahr", "Mogomotsi Magome"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/south-africa-violence-foreign-business.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
