To be sure, they don\u2019t expect the current weakness in leverage loans to trigger a mountain of losses in high-yield bonds, mainly because companies wanting the most leeway as borrowers sought out the once-hot loan market.\n\n\u201cThings may be different in loans, where some of the aggressively structured transactions from the past several years are now coming home to roost,\u201d they wrote.", "description": "Credit conditions are getting tighter and downgrades more frequent in the roughly $1.2 trillion U.S. leveraged loan sector, all signs that excesses of the...", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU064_Cracks_ZG_20191025231124.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
