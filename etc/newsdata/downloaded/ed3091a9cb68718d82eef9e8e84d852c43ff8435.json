If you're confused by the coconuts, they're a reference to the classic comedy film, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', one Musk has admitted to being a fan of before. In it, as protagonist King Arthur is introduced to the sounds of clopping horse hooves, it turns out instead he's actually pretending to gallop along on a horse, while his squire claps coconut shells together.\n\n\ud83d\udca8 & \ud83d\udc10 sounds too (also, of course) \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 6 October 2019\n\nDon't Miss 540 SHARES 137 SHARES 199 SHARES\n\nAdditionally, Musk responded to the tweet saying owners would also have fart and goat noises available to them. The latter is actually a reference to Tesla's 'Toilet Humour Mode', which allows owners to have their car emit sounds of flatulence when signalling a turn.\n\nOther users suggested jungle and rainforest sounds, which Musk seemed to take under consideration, as well as custom recorded audio files. And you know for sure there will be at least a few people that take that excuse to record something incredibly distasteful, or them yelling out a curse word.\n\nThe noisemakers for electric vehicles have been added just ahead of new regulation coming out from the US' central transportation board. These are expected to save an estimated 2,400 people in the US from injuries each year. After all, electric cars are insanely quiet, and at under 30 km/h you may not ever hear them coming at you from behind.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg https://t.co/cgRKiDsdbK \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 7 October 2019\n\nGiven Musk's past record on Twitter though, it's not surprising at all he took it as an opportunity to make fart jokes.", "description": "Teslas recently began installing pedestrian noisemakers in its vehicles, which emit a sound when the car is moving below 30km/h.
