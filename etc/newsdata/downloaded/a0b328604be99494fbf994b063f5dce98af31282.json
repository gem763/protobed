XRP price remained in a positive zone above $0.2850 and it even climbed above the $0.2920 resistance. Moreover, there was a break above the $0.2950 resistance and the price settled well above the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nThe upward move was such that the price traded close to the $0.3000 resistance. Finally, a high was formed near $0.2992 and the price is currently consolidating gains. An immediate support is near the $0.2960 level. It coincides with the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent leg from the $0.2863 low to $0.2992 high. On the downside, there are many supports near the $0.2940 level.\n\nAdditionally, there is a rising channel forming with support near $0.2940 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The channel support coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent leg from the $0.2863 low to $0.2992 high. If there are more downsides, ripple price could test the main $0.2860 and $0.2850 support levels (the recent resistances). An intermediate support is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent leg from the $0.2863 low to $0.2992 high.\n\nOn the upside, an initial resistance is near the $0.3000 level. A successful close above the $0.3000 resistance could set the stage for strong gains in the near term.an immediate resistance is near $0.3020, above which the price may perhaps rally towards the $0.3050 and $0.3080 levels.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price is clearly trading in an uptrend and is gaining momentum above $0.2920. The next stops are near the $0.3000 and $0.3020 levels. Besides, Ethereum is also climbing higher, but bitcoin is struggling to clear the $8,350 and $8,400 resistances.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is gaining strength in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is now well above the 60 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.2960, $0.2940 and $0.2860.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.3000, $0.3020 and $0.3050.", "description": "Ripple price is rising steadily against the US Dollar, bitcoin and Ethereum.
