In Broadway\u2019s A Shout Unscreamed, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Cecily Strong star as two performers from across the pond who give their all \u2014 and then way, way, way too much more \u2014 in pursuit if delivering a convincing Nebraskan accent. This is actually the second Saturday Night Live sketch cut for time this week, making us wonder: who lost track of the clock over there? Not that we\u2019re complaining. Nobody\u2019s going to win a Tony for this play, but at least we got a little more Kyle Mooney and it forced us to look up what Nebraskan accents actually sound like in the wild. Just wonderful.\n\nRelated", "description": "Phoebe Waller-Bridge tries her hand at a Nebraskan accent, and fails, in a Broadway play in this cut for time Saturday Night Live sketch.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/7-SNL-Cut-For-Time-Sketch-Nebraska.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
