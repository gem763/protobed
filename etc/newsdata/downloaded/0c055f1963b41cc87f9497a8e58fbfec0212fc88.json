Yovanovitch adamantly pushed back on those accusations during testimony before investigators on Friday. Kent will also likely be asked about those assertions.\n\nAD\n\nBut internal documents turned over to Congress by the State Department inspector general in early October preview what Kent might tell lawmakers: The messages, which were obtained by The Washington Post, show that Kent thought Yovanovitch had become the target of a \u201cclassic disinformation operation\u201d \u2014 and that he raised concerns about a smear to his superiors in hopes that they\u2019d defend their own.\n\nGiuliani and a columnist for the news outlet the Hill had alleged that Yovanovitch provided a \u201cdo not prosecute list\u201d to Ukrainian officials to protect the Bidens and other allies. But Kent, according to the documents, told his colleagues that the list was phony, pointing to incorrect name spellings that longtime officials like Yovanovitch and himself would never have gotten wrong, he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne key sign of it being fake is that most of the names are misspelled in English \u2014 we would never spell most that way,\u201d said Kent, who is fluent in Russian and Ukrainian, in one email to colleagues.\n\nAD\n\nKent, according to the documents, tried to get his bosses to counter the smear. He suggested that the department could push back by \u201ccircling in red all the misspellings and grammar mistakes and reposting it,\u201d as the U.S. Embassy in Moscow had done in similar counter-propaganda campaigns.\n\n\u201cIf we wanted to push back hard(er), we could consider a similar approach,\u201d he said.\n\nLawmakers are bound to ask Kent about whom he contacted about his concerns. According to the inspector general\u2019s documents, he took them to Philip Reeker, a U.S. diplomat in Europe, and later forwarded them to the No. 3 official at the department, David Hale, and State Department counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a close confidant of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nAD\n\nBrechbuhl also has been summoned for testimony before House Democrats.\n\nAD\n\nIn an attempt to make sense of what he called the \u201cfake list,\u201d Kent suggested it could be an effort by a former Ukrainian prosecutor who was ousted for corruption to try to pin the blame for his failures on the United States.\n\n\u201cThis list appears to be an effort by [Yuri] Lutsenko to inoculate himself for why he did not pursue corrupt associates and political allies \u2014 to claim that the U.S. told him not to,\u201d Kent said. \u201cComplete poppycock.\u201d\n\nLawmakers will most assuredly question Kent about that theory as well, given his vast knowledge of the region.\n\nKent, who joined the State Department in 1992, currently serves as deputy assistant secretary in the European and Eurasian Bureau, where he oversees policy on Ukraine as well as about half a dozen additional countries. From 2015 to 2018, he served as deputy chief of mission in Kiev, Ukraine. Previously he was senior anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department\u2019s European Bureau.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKent is one of more than a half-dozen State officials who have been summoned by Democrats as part of their probe into Trump\u2019s bid to pressure Ukraine into digging up dirt on the Biden family \u2014 and sideline State officials who did not take well to that task. Democrats have also requested documents from the White House, Vice President Pence, the Pentagon, and the Office of Management and Budget, subpoena deadlines that will come due this week.\n\nJohn Hudson contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, is the latest Trump administration official deposed as part of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry of the president.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=128", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
