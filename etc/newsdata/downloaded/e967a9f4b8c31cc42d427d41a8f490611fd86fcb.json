That's unlikely.", "language": "en", "text": "THE TICKER\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping and President Trump attend their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Osaka back in June. (Brendan Smialowski / AFP)\n\nPresident Trump on Tuesday warned the Chinese not to wait until after the 2020 election to strike a trade deal. But the two sides remain far apart on key issues, and the possibility of a breakthrough this year remains remote.\n\nThat\u2019s the candid assessment of three people close to the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide me their unvarnished views of the state of play between the world\u2019s two largest economies. In short, these people agreed, the two sides still have miles to go to resolve U.S. demands for major, structural change in how the Chinese government manages its economy.\n\nAnd for the time being, with the Chinese economy showing signs of stress, Trump appears to feel no urgency to forge anything the administration would tout as a comprehensive agreement.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019ll be a deal maybe soon, maybe before the election, or one day after the election,\" Trump said yesterday. \"And if it\u2019s after the election, it\u2019ll be a deal like you\u2019ve never seen, it\u2019ll be the greatest deal ever and China knows that.\" Trump said he told Chinese leaders: \"If it\u2019s after the election, it\u2019s going to be far worse than what it is right now.\"\n\nThat said, with the two sides restarting mid-level talks this Thursday, they could strike an interim agreement \u2014 a \u201cskinny deal\u201d \u2014 that averts the next round of U.S. tariff escalations, and whatever countermeasures the Chinese would impose in response. Trump has already delayed dialing up tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports from 25 percent to 30 percent, a hike previously scheduled to bite Oct. 1 that will now take effect on Oct. 15.\n\nBut the biggest intensification of the trade war yet is set for Dec. 15, when the Trump administration has pledged to slap a 15 percent import duty on about $160 billion in new goods, most of which are consumer staples.\n\n\u201cThere has been discussion about smaller deal that gets back to $250 billion in tariffs. They are trying to figure out what is in fact possible,\u201d one person close to the talks said. \u201cThe chances of an interim deal are reasonable, though it doesn\u2019t suit either side to talk about it.\u201d\n\nThe second person agreed: \u201cWe might see some delay on some of the tariffs, but we\u2019re certainly not going to see any reversal of tariffs unless there\u2019s a significant structural deal that addresses the issues on the table.\u201d\n\nIndeed, both sides have shown some willingness to soften their respective approaches in recent weeks. Trump \u2014 under heavy pressure from business leaders and donors \u2014 pushed some September tariffs until December. He delayed the October tariffs, he said, to avoid interfering with the Chinese celebration of the 70th anniversary of their revolution. And Beijing last week announced it was easing tariffs on 16 U.S. products and canceling planned tariff increases on imports of American pork and soybeans.\n\nTugboats maneuver a container ship at a port in Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong province. (Chinatopix via AP)\n\nBut each side still has an armory of trade weapons aimed at the other and have also demonstrated they won\u2019t shy from deploying them. The Trump administration on Tuesday rolled out new rules that would give the government greater say in controlling foreign investment \u2014 and the ability to block China from gaining access to sensitive U.S. assets.\n\nAnd it continues threatening Chinese tech giant Huawei with a ban on doing business with American companies: A second 90-day reprieve the administration granted the company will expire in mid-November. \u201cIt\u2019s a national security concern,\u201d Trump told reporters earlier this month. \u201cHuawei is a big concern of our military, of our intelligence agencies, and we are not doing business with Huawei.\u201d\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer \u2014 the architect of Trump\u2019s get-tough approach and a leading voice among the China hawks in the administration \u2014 told business executives Monday that the two sides remain far apart. \"He laid it out by saying this is an extraordinary challenge, and when it all fell apart some months ago they were very, very close to a workable agreement,\u201d U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue, who hosted Lighthizer, said at a press conference Monday, per Politico\u2019s Adam Behsudi. And Donohue said Lighthizer didn\u2019t mention the possibility of an interim agreement.\n\nNevertheless, Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group wrote in a Monday note, \u201cthe new thrust seems to be a \u2018down payment\u2019 or \u2018interim deal\u2019 that could come with *some* tariff relief\u2026 With his flair for the dramatic, we believe it is unlikely this \u2018deal\u2019 would be signed without a Trump-Xi bilateral meeting - most likely at the APEC Summit [in mid-November] in Santiago, Chile.\"\n\nAs for a bigger deal, Trump looks likely to hold out for major concessions on Chinese practices the administration has identified as abusive, including forced transfer of American technology, intellectual property theft, and state subsidies of favored national industries. \u201cHe believes his own rhetoric, has for a long time, and he knows a bunch of soybean purchases are not going to make anybody really happy,\u201d the second person close to the talks told me. \u201cAnd, at the end of the day, he does like tariffs.\"\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington. Not a regular subscriber?\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\n\u2014 Fed forced to step into money markets. WSJ's Nick Timiraos and Daniel Kruger: \"For the first time in more than a decade, the Federal Reserve injected cash into money markets Tuesday to pull down interest rates and said it would do so again Wednesday after technical factors led to a sudden shortfall of cash. The pressures relate to shortages of funds banks face resulting from an increase in federal borrowing and the central bank\u2019s decision to shrink the size of its securities holdings in recent years. It reduced these holdings by not buying new ones when they matured, effectively taking money out of the financial system...\n\n\"The New York Fed moved Tuesday morning to inject $53 billion into the banking system through transactions known as repurchase agreements, or repos. The bank said Tuesday afternoon it would inject up to $75 billion more on Wednesday morning, but many in the market were looking beyond that decision... In the short run this likely affects only market participants who borrow in the overnight markets, but if the strains last long enough it can affect the rates other businesses and consumers pay.\"\n\nFed faces another challenge today: Managing expectations about interest rates. CNBC's Patti Domm: The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for the second time in a decade Wednesday, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is unlikely to deliver the message markets want to hear on plans for future rate cuts. 'He\u2019ll underwhelm everyone and not overwhelm anyone,' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. She expects a cut of 25 basis point, taking the fed funds target rate range to 1.75 to 2.0%, following the last quarter point cut on July 31.\n\n\"At the Fed\u2019s last meeting, Powell rocked markets, sending stocks lower and bond yields higher when he described the rate cut as a 'mid-cycle adjustment,' meaning it was not part of a larger rate cutting cycle... The Fed\u2019s approach may make some market pros unhappy, and it will certainly disappoint [Trump] who said the Fed were boneheads and called for zero or even negative rates.\"\n\n\u2014 Saudi Arabia on track for quick restoration of oil. The Post's Taylor Telford and Thomas Heath: \"Saudi Arabia has restored half of the crude production that was lost to devastating attacks on its oil industry, and the kingdom said output will be fully restored by the end of this month... Saudi Aramco\u2019s critical Abqaiq processing plant has restored 2 million barrels day that was lost due to the wave of drone and missile attacks on the Saudi oil fields, bin Salman said. The energy minister said production will reach 11 million barrels per day by the end of September.\n\nStocks rallied on the news: \"The Dow Jones industrial average was up on Tuesday, one day after it fell on concerns that a protracted loss of Saudi oil production could harm the global economy. The Dow closed at 27,110, up 34 points from where it started the day. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index finished on the day positive at 3,005, a slight gain of 0.26 percent. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.40 percent at 8,186.\"\n\n\u2014 Manufacturing rebounds. WSJ's Harriet Torry: \"U.S. industrial production rose in August, a welcome sign of resilience in the economy after recent weak readings. Industrial production, a measure of factory, mining and utility output, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in August from the prior month, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday, well above economists\u2019 expectations for a 0.2% increase... Tuesday\u2019s report runs counter to earlier signs of weakness in the industrial sector. Output at U.S. factories, which accounts for about 75% of the nation\u2019s total industrial output, rose 0.5% last month from July.\"\n\nTRUMP TRACKER\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nPelosi says Dems are on \u2018a path to yes\u2019 on USMCA: \u201cDemocrats hope to approve a replacement of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but still have concerns about enforcing the deal, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jacob Pramuk reports.\n\nShe also dismissed that it mattered if it helps Trump: \u201cThe idea that we would give a victory to the president is irrelevant. It\u2019s a victory for the American people,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we would give a victory to the president is irrelevant. It\u2019s a victory for the American people,\u201d Pelosi said. Reality check, via Beacon Policy Advisors: \"Pelosi has remained steadfastly 'hopeful' that an agreement can be reached since negotiations between US Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer and a working group of House Democrats she chose began negotiations over the summer. Yet this is not so much a clear sign that she wants the USMCA to pass as it is a clear sign that she does not want Democrats to be blamed if it fails... The reality is that it will be very difficult for her to get the support she would need to ensure the new NAFTA is not passed largely by Republican votes in the House, and it is not clear that she would want that even if it could be easily achieved.\"\n\nTrump Races for Trade Deals With Japan and India as China Fight Persists President Trump wants to secure \u201cminideals\u201d with Japan and India to notch victories on a signature issue as he heads into his re-election campaign. NYT\n\nTRUMP WATCH:\n\n\u2014 Trump eyeing head of embattled mortgage firm to run Ginnie Mae: \u201cA mortgage industry executive with ties to a firm penalized in a U.S. predatory lending crackdown is being considered by the Trump administration to run Ginnie Mae, a government corporation that backs $2 trillion in home-loan securities, according to people familiar with the matter,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Elizabeth Dexheimer and Saleha Mohsin report.\n\n\"Joseph Murin, who previously headed Ginnie Mae for about 13 months under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, is among candidates the White House is looking at to fill the post, said the people, who requested anonymity because the discussions haven\u2019t been made public. Others have been considered for the job leading the mortgage guarantor and it\u2019s not clear when a decision will be announced, the people said.\"\n\n\u2014 Trump\u2019s Cabinet is stocked full of ex-lobbyists: \u201cIn less than three years, [Trump] has named more former lobbyists to Cabinet-level posts than his most recent predecessors did in eight, putting a substantial amount of oversight in the hands of people with ties to the industries they\u2019re regulating,\u201d the Associated Press\u2019s Richard Lardner reports.\n\n\u201cThe Cabinet choices are another sign that Trump\u2019s populist pledge to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 is a catchy campaign slogan but not a serious attempt to change the way Washington works. Instead of staring down \u2018the unholy alliance of lobbyists and donors and special interests\u2019 as Trump recently declared, the influence industry has flourished during his administration.\u201d\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\nGeneral Motors employees protest with United Auto Workers members and labor supporters outside of the Flint Assembly Plant on Monday.
