I know the feeling; my meagre Gears of War skills tend to make me the subject of ridicule by 14-year-olds across the service. And while I can\u2019t stop anyone from telling you off over their headsets when you muck up the game-winning play, Microsoft is making it a lot easier to filter out explicit messages you might receive on Xbox Live.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s new filtering feature isn\u2019t live for everyone just yet, nor has the company announced a release date for said filtering. However, if you sign up to be a free Xbox Insider \u2014 a beta tester, basically \u2014 you can activate the feature right now on your console.\n\nTo get started on PC (which is where I happen to use Xbox Live via the Windows 10 app), you\u2019ll want to navigate to the Windows Store on your system and download the Xbox Insider Hub app.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nOnce you\u2019ve installed the app, launch it and walk through any steps you need to in order to sign up for the beta service. (I\u2019ve already done this on my system, or else I\u2019d walk you through it myself.) You\u2019ll eventually want to click on \u201cInsider Content\u201d on the left-most sidebar and sign up for whatever betas you can access.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nI don\u2019t have an Xbox console in front of me to test this, but if I\u2019m correct, you\u2019ll also want to install the Xbox Insider Hub app on your console; verify what \u201cpreview ring,\u201dor beta test, you want to participate in; and run a system update on your console \u2014 via System > Settings > Updates & downloads \u2014 which should get you the latest test version of the Xbox\u2019s operating system.\n\n(Yes, you could have done this all from your Xbox instead of using your PC at all. I\u2019m hopeful that a beta test of these chat filters will soon roll out to the PC app, too, so you might as well enroll and any and all betas you can get your hands on.)\n\nOnce you\u2019re using a beta version of the Xbox operating system, enabling the new chat filters is as easy as going to System > Settings > General > Online safety & family > Message safety.\n\nOnce there, you\u2019ll be able to set various limits for what kind of filtering you want in the messages you receive. The filters can apply specific naughty words in messages and message requests, media you might receive, and web links, to name a few instances.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nIf you\u2019re a parent in charge of your child\u2019s account, then these filters will automatically default to their strictest setting \u2014 \u201dfriendly\u201d \u2014 for your kid. You can crank it lower if you don\u2019t mind your kid seeing an occasional naughty word or two (or many). And don\u2019t worry, your kid can\u2019t adjust this setting themselves. You\u2019ll also be able to see what filtered messages your kid has received, in case you need to place a phone call to the parents of your kid\u2019s best friend.\n\nThough these filters will eventually work on PC and mobile apps, the current Xbox Insider test appears to only slap these filters on Xbox consoles (as far as I could tell).", "description": "Are you tired of being called every name under the sun whenever you\u2019re trying to play games on Xbox Live?
