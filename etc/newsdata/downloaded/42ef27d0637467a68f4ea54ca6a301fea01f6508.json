It was the latest example of Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy that critics condemn as impulsive, that he sometimes reverses and that frequently is untethered to the advice of his national security aides.\n\n\u201cA catastrophic mistake,\u201d said Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican leader. \u201cShot in the arm to the bad guys,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nTrump said he understood criticism from fellow GOP leaders but disagreed. He said he could also name supporters, but he didn\u2019t.\n\nPentagon and State Department officials held out the possibility of persuading Turkey to abandon its expected invasion. U.S. officials said they had seen no indication that Turkey had begun a military operation by late Monday.\n\nTrump, in late afternoon remarks to reporters, appeared largely unconcerned at the prospect of Turkish forces attacking the Kurds, who include a faction he described as \u201cnatural enemies\u201d of the Turks.\n\n\u201cBut I have told Turkey that if they do anything outside of what we would think is humane \u2026 they could suffer the wrath of an extremely decimated economy,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn recent weeks, the U.S. and Turkey had reached an apparent accommodation of Turkish concerns about the presence of Kurdish fighters, seen in Turkey as a threat. American and Turkish soldiers had been conducting joint patrols in a zone along the border. As part of that work, barriers designed to protect the Kurds were dismantled amid assurances that Turkey would not invade.\n\nGraham said Turkey\u2019s NATO membership should be suspended if it attacks into northeastern Turkey, potentially annihilating Kurdish fighters who acted as a U.S. proxy army in a five-year fight to eliminate the Islamic State\u2019s so-called caliphate. Graham, who had talked Trump out of a withdrawal from Syria last December, said letting Turkey invade would be a mistake of historic proportion and would \u201clead to ISIS reemergence .\u201d\n\nThis all comes at a pivotal moment of Trump\u2019s presidency. House Democrats are marching forward with their impeachment inquiry into whether he compromised national security or abused his office by seeking negative information on former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival, from Ukraine and other foreign countries.\n\nAs he faces the impeachment inquiry, Trump has appeared more focused on making good on his political pledges, even at the risk of sending a troubling signal to American allies abroad.\n\n\u201cI campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our soldiers home and bring them home as rapidly as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe strong pushback on Capitol Hill prompted Trump to recast as well as restate his decision, but with renewed bombast and self-flattery.\n\nHe promised to destroy the Turkish economy \u201cif Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits.\u201d\n\nSunday night the White House had said the U.S. would get its troops out of the way of the Turkish forces. That announcement came after Trump spoke by phone with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nOne official described that White House announcement as a botched effort appeared aimed at making Trump look bold for ending a war. The official said attempts by the Pentagon and State Department to make the statement stronger in its opposition to Turkey\u2019s military action were unsuccessful.\n\nThat official, like others interviewed, was not authorized to speak on the record and was granted anonymity to comment.\n\nThe official added that Erdogan appeared to be reconsidering his earlier resolve because he was relatively quiet Monday. But damage done to relations with the Kurds could be irreparable.\n\nAn official familiar with the Erdogan call said the Turkish president was \u201cranting\u201d at Trump, saying the safe zone was not working and that Turkey couldn\u2019t trust the U.S. military to do what was needed. And in reaction, Trump said the U.S. wanted no part of an invasion and would withdraw troops.\n\nThe announcement threw the military situation in Syria into fresh chaos and injected deeper uncertainty into U.S. relations with European allies. A French official, speaking on condition of anonymity on a sensitive topic, said France wasn\u2019t informed ahead of time. A Foreign Ministry statement warned Turkey to avoid any action that would harm the international coalition against the Islamic State and noted the Kurds had been essential allies. It entirely omitted any mention of the United States.\n\nU.S. involvement in Syria has been fraught with peril since it started in 2014 with the insertion of small numbers of special operations forces to recruit, train, arm and advise local fighters to combat the Islamic State. Trump entered the White House in 2017 intent on getting out of Syria, and even before the counter-IS military campaign reclaimed the last militant strongholds early this year, he declared victory and said troops would leave.\n\nTrump defended his latest decision, acknowledging in tweets that \u201cthe Kurds fought with us\u201d but adding that they \u201cwere paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn his later remarks, Trump asserted that American troops in Syria are not performing useful work. They are, he said, \u201cnot fighting.\u201d They are \u201cjust there,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the first to move were about 30 U.S. troops from two outposts who would be in the immediate area of a Turkish invasion. It\u2019s unclear whether others among the roughly 1,000 U.S. forces in northeastern Syria would be moved, but officials said there was no plan for any to leave Syria entirely.\n\nBulent Aliriza, director of the Turkey Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that a U.S. withdrawal from Syria would be a major boost to Russia\u2019s position there.\n\nHe added that other allies in the region, including the Kurds, will \u201clook at this withdrawal as U.S. unwillingness to stand up for its rights and maintain its alliances in the region.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., another strong Trump supporter, said in an appearance on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that he had concerns.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure we keep our word for those who fight with us and help us,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cIf you make a commitment and somebody is fighting with you, America should keep their word.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump administration officials also expressed concern.\n\nNikki Haley, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the U.S. \u201cmust always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. \u2026 Leaving them to die is a big mistake.\u201d\n\nTurkey considers the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, an extension of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has waged an insurgency against Turkey for 35 years.\n\n___\n\nWith contributions from Associated Press writers Zeynep Bilginsoy in Istanbul; Zeina Karam and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut and Lori Hinnant in Paris.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Monday cast his decision to abandon Kurdish fighters in Syria as fulfilling a campaign promise to withdraw", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/07/d2d901_trump-09563-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-winks-as-he-listens-trade-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
