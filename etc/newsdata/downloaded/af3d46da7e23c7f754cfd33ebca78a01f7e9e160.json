The future belongs to patriots.\u2019\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d fixation was on stark display on Tuesday in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, where he boasted of his accomplishments while in office while emphasizing overall his nationalist ideology.\n\n\"Like my beloved country, each nation represented in this hall, has a cherished history, culture and heritage, that is worth defending and celebrating, and which gives us our singular potential and strength. The free world must embrace its national foundations. It must not attempt to erase them or replace them,\" Trump told a silent crowd of world leaders and aides. \u201cThe future doesn\u2019t belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.\"\n\nForeign leaders listened closely to Trump\u2019s speech, his third to the multilateral body.\n\nThe president's annual addresses to the international body have often been the stage for some of his most memorable rhetoric. In his first speech there, Trump nicknamed North Korea\u2019s leader \u201cRocket Man,\u201d a nickname the president used until the two leaders became friendly amid thawing tensions between their nations. Trump\u2019s second address elicited outright laughter in the chamber hall when he bragged his administration had accomplished more in two years than \u201calmost any administration.\u201d\n\nTuesday's statement marked the the third year in a row that Trump espoused an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, the populist message he pledged to embrace on the 2016 campaign trail that helped fuel his victory.\n\n\"The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations, who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors and honor the differences that make each country special and unique,\" he said.\n\nTrump spoke deliberately, reading from a teleprompter, appearing not to deviate from prepared remarks.\n\nTrump began by touting his military buildup since taking office, though he added that \u201chopefully it will never have to use this power.\u201d\n\nThe president also dedicated a significant chunk of his speech to condemning Iran's aggression, reiterating his calls for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis in Iran but maintaining that he is prepared to respond with force to defend U.S. interests if necessary.\n\nTrump had stark words for the Islamic Republic, declaring that \"as long as Iran's menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted,\" adding that \"no responsible government should subsidize Iran's bloodlust.\"", "description": "\u2018The future doesn\u2019t belong to globalists.
