He\u2019s trying to do damage.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals are one of the National League\u2019s top teams for many reasons: Veterans like Yadier Molina and Paul Goldschmidt anchor the lineup. Young starting pitchers including Dakota Hudson and Jack Flaherty have grown into reliable options.\n\nBut Edman\u2019s constant production over the past three months has also been incredibly valuable, especially because he was a mostly unknown prospect outside of St. Louis coming into the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome,\u201d Edman said. \u201cComing into this year, I didn\u2019t really have too much expectation of being to help the big-league team, so it\u2019s great to be up here and contributing.\u201d\n\nEdman is batting .299 with 11 homers and 33 RBIs since being called up in early June. He has stolen 14 bases and provided solid defense at third base, second base and right field.\n\nThe 24-year-old is now a mainstay in the lineup as the Cardinals have pushed their way to the top of the NL Central. He was called up from Triple-A after an injury to Jedd Gyroko and was initially a bench player asked to provide infield depth.\n\nThat assignment grew into a more regular role after a few more injuries. Now, the Cardinals can barely go a game without having him on the field.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got really good awareness of what\u2019s going on in the game, he\u2019s prepared well, sees the ball well and then lets his ability play,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said.\n\nEdman was a sixth-round pick by the Cardinals in the 2016 draft out of Stanford. DeJong and others thought he could be a good major league player after watching him in spring training, but just about everyone - including Edman - thought that time would come in 2020 or 2021.\n\nHe hit for average throughout the minor leagues, but the big-league power surge is a surprise. He never hit more than seven homers during any year in the minors.\n\nEdman credited Goldschmidt in his progression as a hitter, especially when it comes to studying video. As the Stanford education might suggest, Edman\u2019s always had a cerebral approach to hitting.\n\nIf anything, he\u2019s had to make sure he\u2019s not thinking too much.\n\n\u201cI err on the side of having a lot of information in my head,\u201d Edman said. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting a little better at not overloading myself, focusing on what\u2019s important and get into crazy specifics. It\u2019s more of a general plan.\u201d\n\nAs for Shildt, he has to think less and less about including Edman in the lineup. The answer, at least of late, is almost always yes.\n\nAfter the Cardinals lost 3-2 in a 19-inning marathon on Tuesday night, Shildt packed his Wednesday afternoon lineup with reserves that didn\u2019t play much the night before.\n\nBut there was Edman, right back at the top of the lineup.\n\nHe responded with two more hits. He\u2019ll probably need a few more if the Cardinals want to clinch the NL Central since the Brewers are just 1 \u00bd games back with four days remaining in the regular season.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t make anything bigger than it is,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cHe just goes and plays. He\u2019s able to see the game and make his own adjustments really quick.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tommy Edman was up at the plate on Monday night, barely 24 hours after his St. Louis Cardinals had finished an emotional four-game sweep of the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/nationals_cardinals_baseball_17890_c0-98-2360-1474_s1770x1032.jpg?37dda99b9bad4e716311d3c9837b8d4608302cd8", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
