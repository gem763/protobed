Today, Fonda went into the third week of her involvement in regular protests dubbed \u201cFire Drill Fridays\u201d at the Capitol, and was arrested yet again, this time alongside TV\u2019s own Ted Danson. As covered by the Washington Post\u2019s Hannah Jewell, Danson introduced himself as Jane Fonda\u2019s \u201cnew trainee\u201d when he and Fonda spoke to an assembled crowd before they headed toward the steps of the Capitol Building to be arrested.\n\nTed Danson introduces himself as Jane Fonda\u2019s \u201cnew trainee\u201d pic.twitter.com/WjsCk3szjo \u2014 Hannah Jewell (@hcjewell) October 25, 2019\n\nHe did it, folks.

She has said that she plans to continue protesting \u201cevery Friday, rain or shine, inspired and emboldened by the incredible movement our youth have created.\u201d Plus, there\u2019s a seemingly endless list of other actors she could probably recruit to come along with her. How soon until Jane Fonda gets arrested alongside the entire cast of Book Club?", "description": "Jane Fonda was arrested at her weekly Friday climate change protest yet again, this time alongside \u201cThe Good Place\u201d star Ted Danson.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/25/25-ted-danson-jane-fonda.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
