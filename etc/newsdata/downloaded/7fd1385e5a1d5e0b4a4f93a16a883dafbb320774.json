What it missed was a focus on tackling inequalities \u2013 both structural and social.\n\nTo improve health we need to be striving for change, that is unquestionable.\n\nBut the frenzied conversations that are whipped up about these issues create outrage, with an unwavering focus on behaviours as a solution, have created a red herring.\n\nWe need to take action through a variety of avenues, from policy interventions which tackle the structural and social causes of poor health, through to fostering an understanding of the complexity of weight and reducing weight stigma.\n\nAll this includes, of course, striving to improve our food environment.\n\nBut we need to remember that most barriers to \u2018healthy eating\u2019 aren\u2019t due to a lack of education or awareness that on balance, most of us should be eating our vegetables and moving more \u2013 they are created by the society and environment we live in.\n\nAs noted in Dame Sally\u2019s report, the children living in the most deprived areas are disproportionately affected by poor health and \u2018obesity\u2019.\n\nStopping them snacking on buses probably won\u2019t help with this.\n\nBut perhaps \u2013 as crazy as it sounds \u2013 improving their lives and reducing inequalities will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: My Label and Me: I\u2019m living my best fat life\n\nMORE: Couple lose 15 stone between them by batch-cooking meals for 60p a dish\n\nMORE: I lost weight because I was deeply unhappy, and all I got were compliments", "description": "Helen and Rosie from the Rooted Project respond to Dame Sally Davies' report that there should be a ban on eating on public transport.", "authors": ["Helen West", "Rosie Saunt", "Authors", "Registered Dietitians", "Co-Founders Of The Rooted Project"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1152653394_1570726488.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
