(Screencap via WNEP/Screencap via WNEP)\n\nTwo days before his wedding, the groom spent the afternoon floating down the Delaware River in eastern Pennsylvania with his wedding party. Groomsmen and bridesmaids passed around beers and shots of vodka as they guided paddle boards and rafts downstream.\n\nWhen they returned to their hotel on Aug. 30, Daniel J. Carney\u2019s wife-to-be asked him to walk a friend inside. The 29-year-old Oregon woman had been too drunk to keep her balance on her paddle board, the Morning Call reported, and as Carney walked her down the hallway, she swayed and struggled to stay upright.\n\nSuddenly, Carney pulled the woman into the men\u2019s locker room. Then, police say, the groom led the woman to the showers, where he forcibly grabbed her, bit her and removed her bikini bottoms.\n\nThen the bride walked in.\n\nOn Thursday, prosecutors charged Carney, 28, of Stroudsburg, Pa., with felony sexual assault, according to court records. Pennsylvania State Police say it used security footage, text messages and an intercepted phone call to support the bridesmaid\u2019s allegation that she had been sexually assaulted while \u201cblackout\u201d drunk.\n\nAs the groom scrambled to explain his behavior, the wedding went on as planned, local TV station WNEP reported.\n\n\u201cIt was chaos amongst the entire wedding party,\u201d the woman told police, the Morning Call reported.\n\nTwo very different stories emerged from the wedding party about the locker room encounter at the red-roofed Shawnee Inn and Golf Resort, tucked into a lush wooded hillside on the riverfront in Monroe County, Pa.\n\nThe woman, whom The Washington Post is not naming because she is a victim of sexual assault, later told police she could remember only snippets of the night and could not recall much of the alleged assault, but that she was certain she had been violated.\n\nShe told police she\u2019d had three beers and one or two shots of vodka to drink that day, and had splashed into the water several times before floating the rest of the journey on the group\u2019s raft before Carney led her into the hotel.\n\nThe victim told police she woke up briefly on the floor of the locker room to a sharp pain as Carney allegedly bit her and pawed at her body. She said she passed out again, only to wake up minutes later to realize her bikini bottoms had been removed and Carney was on top of her.\n\nTwenty minutes later, police say, his fiancee burst into the men\u2019s showers. The bridesmaid told police her friend immediately started screaming at Carney. The bride followed him into the parking lot and the two got into a physical fight, according to court records.\n\nAnother bridesmaid helped the woman walk out of the showers, the Morning Call reported.\n\nThe next morning, Carney called the bridesmaid to apologize but claimed he didn\u2019t know what they had done the night before, according to the police report. On the morning of the wedding, he texted again to ask the woman to put on a good face for the wedding and to pressure her to take the morning after pill to prevent a pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI wanted to apologize again for everything,\u201d he wrote in a lengthy message, according to the probable cause affidavit. \u201cCan we please just be as happy as possible for [the bride] today? Mistakes are behind us and I just need total closure before I do this [that is] why I\u2019m sending this. I\u2019m as happy as ever to marry [the bride] and I know this is terrible as well but my d--- was out in the shower. We never did do it but would you consider taking plan b to make damn certain just in case? There is almost no chance but still. Please tell me yes I\u2019m begging you.\"\n\nDespite the shocking incident, WNEP reported, the couple still got married Sept. 1.\n\nBut the next morning, the bridesmaid went to the hospital to report that she\u2019d been sexually assaulted. She told police she felt \u201cextremely violated and upset.\u201d\n\nCarney, meanwhile, allegedly told his guests the woman had \u201cfollowed him\u201d into the locker room after he told her he was going to shower. He later told a state trooper he was extremely drunk and felt she had \u201ctaken advantage\u201d of him.\n\nBut police say a clearer picture of the night began to emerge after they pulled security footage from the hotel.\n\n\u201cThe footage showed the victim and the accused walking down the hallway, with the victim extremely unsteady on her feet and swaying,\u201d state trooper Justin Leri wrote in a police report. \u201cJust before the doorway, the accused is observed turning around and pulling the victim into the locker room.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where the reach of the hotel\u2019s security cameras stops, according to a probable cause affidavit reported by WNEP. After police reviewed the video, Carney changed his story, admitting he\u2019d grabbed the woman by the arms and pulled her into the locker room.\n\nPolice then intercepted a second call between Carney and the bridesmaid, during which he claimed they did not have \u201cactual sex,\u201d but \u201crepeatedly told her he was sorry, specifically repeating that it was all his fault.\u201d He also admitted to leading the woman into the locker room during the phone call, the Morning Call reported.\n\nProsecutors charged Carney with simple assault, indecent assault and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse of an unconscious person. An arraignment has not yet been scheduled for Carney, and his case is awaiting a preliminary hearing. His lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment late Sunday.", "description": "Security footage shows Daniel Carney pulled a 29-year-old woman into the men's locker room at a Pennsylvania hotel before sexually assaulting her, police say.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter", "October At Am", "Katie Shepherd Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
