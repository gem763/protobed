At least one scientist had her suspicions however, having noticed that he left a coffee in the room and returned with a tea. \u201cShe\u2019s a scientist so trained to draw deductions from the things she observes,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cI\u2019d decided I needed a little less agitation rather than more.\u201d\n\nThe three laureates will share the 9m Swedish kronor (\u00a3740,000) equally, according to the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Asked what he intended to do with the windfall, Ratcliffe said: \u201cI\u2019ll be discussing that with my wife in private. But it\u2019ll be something good.\u201d\n\nKaelin was half-asleep when his phone went. \u201cI was aware as a scientist that if you get a phone call at 5am with too many digits, it\u2019s sometimes very good news, and my heart started racing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all a bit surreal.\u201d\n\nIn work that spanned more than two decades, the researchers teased apart different aspects of how cells in the body first sense and then respond to low oxygen levels. The gas is crucial for tiny structures called mitochondirconverting food into useful energy.\n\nWhen the amount of oxygen available to cells drops, levels of a protein complex named HIF rise. This ramps up the activity of a gene used in the production of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that in turn boosts the creation of red blood cells.\n\nRandall Johnson, professor of molecular physiology and pathology at Cambridge University, said this year\u2019s Nobel laureates \u201chave greatly expanded our knowledge of how physiological response makes life possible.\u201d\n\nThe role of HIF is crucial from the earliest days of life, Randall said. \u201cIf an embryo doesn\u2019t have the HIF gene it won\u2019t survive past very early embryogenesis. Even in the womb our bodies need this gene to do everything they do.\u201d\n\nThe work has already led to a swathe of drugs, such as roxadustat and daprodustat, which treat anaemia by fooling the body into thinking it is at high altitude, making it churn out more oxygen-carrying red blood cells. But similar drugs aim to help heart disease and lung cancer patients who struggle to get enough oxygen into their blood stream. More experimental drugs based on the finding seek to prevent cancers from growing by blocking their ability to make new blood vessels.", "description": "William G Kaelin, Sir Peter Ratcliffe and Gregg L Semenza win 9m Swedish kronor prize for work on how cells adapt to oxygen availability", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d9bddc64b214b94d1da41d710922a12b0e2a148/0_188_4736_2841/master/4736.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f3b3895a4cc92182a4dd3ed416f88fd", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
