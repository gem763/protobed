Facebook/Cathryn Lee\n\nA Malaysian actress and social media influencer has come under fire after posting a statement calling for women to \u201ctry to drop down to size 4/XS\u201d.\n\nCathryn Lee, 30, had said in an Instagram Story that \u201cM= fat\u201d, and that \u201canything above M is as sinful as obesity\u201d.\n\nIn the same post, she told her 1.1 million followers that she was a \u201csize 2/XXS\u201d, and urged women above a size 6 to \u201c[please], stop eating and move your a** to the gym already\u201d.\n\nWhile Instagram Stories typically last just 24 hours, Lee\u2019s post spread like wildfire after irked followers took screenshots. Some memes were even inspired as a result.\n\nNetizens did not take kindly to Lee\u2019s advice for women, with many calling her out for body-shaming. One Instagram user even called it \u201cshameful behaviour\u201d.\n\ncathryn li\u2019s mindset about weight and sizes..wow \u2014 \u2744\ufe0fprod suga x kty\u2744\ufe0f. cessa\ud83c\udf78 (@yangfeng_) October 3, 2019\n\nw0w im already struggling w being comfortable abt my body and i see cathryn li\u2019s rant \ud83d\ude2e \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/cgGSL2HN8e \u2014 ysa (@possumbly) October 3, 2019\n\ncathryn li is actually scum lmao pic.twitter.com/wdBWqUbsRn \u2014 almond milk (@vickymaybe) September 30, 2019\n\nShe later deactivated her Instagram account, Says.com reported.\n\nOn Monday (Oct 8), Lee finally broke her silence on the issue by issuing an apology in both English and Mandarin on her Facebook page, which has more than 1.65 million followers.\n\nIn the statement, the actress asked for forgiveness and acknowledged that her earlier post was \u201chighly offensive and insensitive\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have offended nearly all my friends, family and supporters with my \u2018M size\u2019 post,\u201d she wrote, adding that \u201cit was never my intention to impose any judgement on anyone with that sweeping statement\u201d.\n\nLee also said that the advice she gave was \u201cintended for my model friends who like me, despite being of a healthy weight in the past, [had] previously been unable to secure a modelling job due the size criteria imposed\u201d.\n\n\u201cI thought that by bringing up the size expectations of the industry, I was motivating us to stay fit and trim by hitting the gym.\n\n\u201cLooking back, I now realise how that was a mistake at many levels. Not only was the tone of my message offensive, I was encouraging friends to conform to an unhealthy beauty standard, which I have imposed also on myself,\u201d she said.\n\nLee ended her note by saying that she was responsible for the content she shares with her followers.\n\n\u201cThere is no nice way to say that I have messed up, and I seek your forgiveness on my mistakes and shortcomings,\u201d she said.\n\nAs of October 8, Lee\u2019s Instagram account had been reactived.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - She had said that \"anything above M is as sinful as obesity\"..
