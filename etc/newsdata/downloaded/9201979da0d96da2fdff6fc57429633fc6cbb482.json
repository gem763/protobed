This electric go-kart is made entirely from Lego, so if you\u2019ve got bins and bins of plastic bricks left over from your childhood, it might be time to dust them all off and get building.\n\nIt took about three weeks and over 7,000 pieces to build this go-kart, which is mostly assembled from Lego Technic pieces including 32 tiny electric motors (eight in every wheel) that propel it to a top speed of almost 4km per hour \u2014 depending on the weight of the rider, who needs to be under 70kg.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to be winning any races on this thing, but there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll still be rolling faster than the slowly crawling traffic you usually have to deal with on the way to work.\n\nThe go-kart is controlled using an app on a smartphone that can be mounted to its steering wheel, and is powered by eight BuWizz bricks; a third-party alternative to the boxes Lego includes to power and control the electric motors and sensors you can incorporate into your creations.\n\nThe standard Lego control bricks could have certainly been used for this build, but the go-kart\u2019s performance would have been even worse as the BuWizz bricks offer significantly more power and better battery life.\n\nThere\u2019s no braking system so far as we can tell, the electric motors can just be used to bring the go-kart from its snail\u2019s pace to a full stop. But it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll have to worry about losing control and hitting something or someone at these speeds. If you do, any damages should be cheap to repair \u2014 or you can just use all the pieces to build something else.", "description": "If you haven\u2019t been able to scrounge up a few hundred dollars to improve your daily commute with an electric scooter, there might be an alternative hiding in your parents\u2019 basement.
