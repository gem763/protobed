There\u2019s a whole country of Christians \u2014 and honestly, a whole moderate and even sane segment of the gay community and LGBTQ population \u2014 who think the same.\n\nHis words: \u201cI will not bow down at the altar of the LGBTQ agenda nor worship their rainbow pride flag. I\u2019m going to stand with the Word of God \u2014 the Holy Bible, which is truth from cover to cover,\u201d he tweeted, as Breitbart reported.\n\nYep. That\u2019s the slap O\u2019Rourke deserves.\n\nICYMI: O\u2019Rourke said at a CNN-hosted \u201cEquality in America\u201d town hall last week that \u201cyes,\u201d colleges, churches, charities should lose tax-exempt status if they opposed same-sex marriage.\n\nHe elaborated by saying, \u201cThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, or any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single on os us. And so as president, we are going to make that a priority and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t say.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know which is worse \u2014 O\u2019Rourke\u2019s ignorance of the founding of America or O\u2019Rourke\u2019s ignorance of the First Amendment.\n\nAs Graham wrote: \u201cThis gives you a clue of what the progressive, socialist-leading Dem. Party would try to force on our nation if they win any election. They will create laws & \u2018consequences\u2019 that would punish those who don\u2019t agree w/ them. This is a threat to religious freedom & free speech.\u201d\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nVote Democrat \u2014 and vote for tyranny.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
