The meme, which was reminiscent of wartime propaganda posters, said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t win two world wars to be pushed around by a Kraut,\u201d alongside a photo of Merkel stood with her arm aloft.\n\nIt was accompanied by a comment saying: \u201cAngela Merkel\u2019s demand that Britain leaves Northern Ireland to rot inside the customs union is reprehensible and shows the true colours of our supposed \u2018European allies\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe furore came after a No 10 source said Merkel\u2019s demands for Northern Ireland after Brexit had made a deal \u201cessentially impossible\u201d, leading to accusations that Boris Johnson was trying to play a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d.\n\nIn the Commons on Tuesday, the Independent Group for Change MP Chris Leslie criticised the \u201cdeliberate dog-whistle briefing\u201d and warned of its consequences.\n\n\u201cIt has sparked a series of frankly racist attacks against the Germans, from Leave.EU and others,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an extremely dangerous course for the government to embark on, and I want to hear \u2013 right now \u2013 the minister condemn and distance himself from it.\u201d\n\nMichael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, dissociated himself from \u201cany sort of racist or demeaning language towards Germany\u201d and said he had reaffirmed the UK\u2019s commitment to friendship at a German day of national unity event at the country\u2019s embassy last week.\n\n\u201cThe Germans are our friends and our allies, and Germany is a great country,\u201d he told MPs, after politicians from across the spectrum had earlier criticised the image.\n\nThe Labour MP David Lammy tweeted: \u201cDear Germany and the EU, please accept our apologies and do not be fooled into thinking Leave.EU\u2019s xenophobic bile is representative of the UK. A clear majority of Brits now oppose Brexit in all its forms. A vast, young and vibrant pro-EU movement in Britain stands with you.\u201d\n\nThe Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, said the advert was \u201cinsulting and offensive\u201d.\n\n\u201cLanguage such as this is stoking divisions within our society and should not be considered acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cEU citizens are our neighbours, friends and family. This demonstrates the depths that Leave.EU will go to as they try and tear our country apart.\u201d\n\nBanks tweeted an apology on Wednesday morning, saying: \u201cThe Leave.EU team went too far yesterday but the real outrage is the German suggestion that Northern Ireland be separated from the UK. As a result we will delete the post and apologise accordingly \u2026 on reflection the point could have been made better.\u201d\n\nLeave.EU retweeted the post as it said: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry.\u201d", "description": "Leave.EU co-founder says it went too far after anger over anti-German meme", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/409453f0a21d9ac60da25af2366bbce9460f997d/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2da86c036dcf208eb999814eb5972ca", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
