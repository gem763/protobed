But no one should be surprised that some voters in our age of mistrust and fragmentation and despair prefer the honest graft \u2014 some in Trump\u2019s base, and also some in the ranks of the alienated and aggrieved middle, the peculiar Obama-Trump constituency.\n\nIndeed, history is replete with \u201cboss\u201d-style politicians who got away with corruption because they were seen as the rough, effective alternative to a smug, hypocritical elite. Trump\u2019s crucial political weakness is that unlike those bosses, he hasn\u2019t delivered that much to many of his voters. But that may make him all the more eager to return to the politics of comparative corruption, to have the argument again about whether he\u2019s more ethically challenged than the swamp. He may not win it, but at least he\u2019s playing a part that he knows well.\n\nThird, an impeachment battle would give Trump a last chance to solidify his hold on the souls and reputations of his possible Republican successors. To understand what I mean, consider Jonathan V. Last\u2019s explanation of why so few Republican elected officials are likely to break with Trump, no matter how Nixonian his straits become:\n\nOne of the reasons Republicans were able to pressure Nixon to resign was that they knew Nixon cared about the institution of the Republican Party. Another reason is that they knew that Nixon would go away and keep quiet in a self-imposed exile after his presidency. He wasn\u2019t going to spend his winter years taking shots at [Charles] Wiggins and Goldwater and Ford on Twitter 15 times a day. Neither of those assumptions are operable with Trump.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just explain why Trump thinks he can survive an impeachment fight; it also explains why he might relish it. He knows that he could well lose the next election, but there\u2019s no reason a mere general-election defeat will prevent him from wielding power over the Republican Party, via Twitter and other means, for many years to come. And what better way to consolidate that power (or at least the feeling of that power) in the last year of his administration than seeing all his would-be successors, all the bright younger men of the Senate especially, come down and kiss the ring one last time?\n\nCome on down, Marco Rubio! Step right up, Ben Sasse! Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, the history books are watching: Tell us one more time, just one more time, how completely Donald Trump the Great owns your vote, your principles, your honor!\n\nWhich brings us to the last reason Trump might kind of like to be impeached: Because the circus is the part of politics that he fundamentally enjoys. Throughout the Mueller investigation my Twitter feed was alight with liberal and NeverTrump fantasies about how Trump must be bed-wetting, flop-sweat terrified by the tough G-man\u2019s investigation. And maybe at times he was. But I\u2019m pretty sure that when he ranted on Twitter about the \u201cTwelve Angry Democrats\u201d and \u201cWITCH HUNT\u201d and \u201cNO COLLUSION,\u201d he was more engaged, more alive, more fully his full self than at any point during the legislative battles over tax reform or Obamacare repeal.\n\nAnd Robert Mueller\u2019s was a legal investigation, with the power to actually put people in Trump\u2019s inner circle in prison. A merely political trial, where the worst-case scenario is a political martyrdom that Sean Hannity will sing of ever after, seems to offer Trump a much lower-stress variation on that experience. Why, the nicknames for the impeachment managers alone will be a Trumpian banquet, a veritable feast!\n\n[Listen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]", "description": "Four reasons the president might welcome articles of impeachment.", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/opinion/23douthatWeb/23douthatWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
