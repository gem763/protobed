REUTERS/Ints Kalnins\n\nShares in Telenor, which has expanded in Asia in pursuit of growth outside its mature home market in Scandinavia, fell on Friday\u2019s announcement by the two companies that talks were over.\n\n\u201cThis removes the prospect for $5 billion of potential deal synergies,\u201d brokerage Jefferies said in a research note.\n\nTelenor sold its central European operations last year as it seeks to focus on its Nordic and Asian businesses.\n\nThe proposed non-cash combination of Telenor\u2019s telecom and infrastructure assets in Asia with Axiata\u2019s would have had operations in nine countries including Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia, with a total population of nearly 1 billion people.\n\nFailure of the talks also highlights the difficulty of merging phone operators around the world and the growing problems it presents for investors.\n\nThe joint venture would have competed with firms such as Singapore Telecommunications (STEL.SI) and created an entity worth $40 billion including debt, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters in May when the talks were first announced.\n\nTelenor said in a statement that both parties had agreed to end the discussions \u201cdue to some complexities involved in the proposed transaction\u201d, without giving further details of what had scuppered plans for the largest such cross-border deal in Asia, excluding China and Japan.\n\nHowever, Telenor left the door open to a deal with Axiata, saying both companies \u201cstill acknowledge the strong strategic rationale\u201d of the combination and \u201cdo not rule out that a future transaction could be possible.\u201d\n\nAxiata President and Chief Executive Jamaludin Ibrahim said later on Friday that the company was \u201csurprised\u201d by the collapse of the planned deal.\n\n\u201cWe know that this has come as a surprise for most of you, and for us too, actually,\u201d he told a conference call with analysts.\n\nShares in Telenor were down 4.2% at 0931 GMT, lagging a flat European STOXX 600 Telecoms index .SXKP. Axiata shares were trading up 2.3% before being halted, pending the news.\n\n\u201cIt has been a theme among investors that this deal could have created fair amount of value,\u201d said Stefan Billing, analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux.\n\n\u201cTelenor and Axiata have been talking about synergies, and there has also been expectations on a high valuation of the planned listing, so it\u2019s natural that there is a bit of disappointment initially.\u201d\n\nThe Norwegian mobile operator was to have owned a 56.5% stake and Axiata the remaining 43.5% with no cash changing hands, the companies had previously said.\n\n\u201cThe Board acknowledges the strong strategic rationale of the proposed transaction and is equally cognizant of the level of complexity of such a deal,\u201d Axiata Chairman Ghazzali Sheikh Abdul Khalid said in a statement, only days after the Malaysian company said the deal was on track.\n\nAxiata was not immediately available for comment on Friday, while Telenor declined further comment.\n\nJOBS AND CONTROL\n\nControl of the combined entity and job cuts could have been the main sticking points, particularly for the Malaysian government, whose sovereign wealth fund Khazanah owns a 37% stake in Axiata.\n\n\u201cMalaysian government-linked corporations usually want more control and that\u2019s no different with Axiata. But would Telenor let go?\u201d a telecoms analyst in Kuala Lumpur said, declining to be named as he was talking about the government.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Axiata headquarters building is seen in Kuala Lumpur May 28, 2014. REUTERS/Samsul Said\n\nIn March, the fund, which has housed Axiata in its commercial portfolio, announced a new strategy under which it will look to trim stakes in non-strategic assets to improve returns to the government.\n\n\u201c(Malaysian Prime Minister) Mahathir (Mohamad) was also clear to say the government did not want any retrenchment in the cost rationalization,\u201d said the analyst.\n\n\u201cIn any merger, there is always cost rationalization, and the first thing is chopping headcount. If the company is not allowed that, what\u2019s the point of the exercise?\u201d", "description": "Telenor and Malaysia's Axiata Group have ended talks to create a telecoms joint venture with nearly 300 million customers across South Asia and Southeast Asia in a blow to the Norwegian group's growth strategy and shares.", "authors": ["Gwladys Fouche", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426943152&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851CM", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
