Seems like a logical workaround for John Cho\u2019s recent on-set knee injury, which has reportedly forced Netflix to temporarily stop production on their live-action remake of Cowboy Bebop. The actor stars as Spike Spiegel, the intergalactic bounty hunter at the center of the original space Western anime. According to Deadline, Cho was injured in a \u201cfreak accident\u201d on \u201cthe last take of a routine and well-rehearsed scene\u201d while filming in New Zealand. His injury must have been gnarly, because production will purportedly shut down for seven to nine months while he recovers from surgery in L.A.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts are with John and he has our complete support as he recuperates from this injury,\u201d a Netflix spokesperson told Deadline on Friday. To add insult to injury, Cowboy Bebop just went into production earlier this month, a glimpse of which you can see in Corgi-vision via the dog actress cast to playing Spike\u2019s pet Ein. Could they maybe use the Corgi to disguise John Cho\u2019s knee scooter? These are the questions a room full of Netflix employees are hashing out right now.", "description": "Netflix reportedly shut down the production of their live-action remake of the anime Cowboy Bebop after star John Cho injured his knee on-set.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/18-John-Cho.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
