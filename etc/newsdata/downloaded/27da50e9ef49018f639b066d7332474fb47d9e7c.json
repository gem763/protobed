That information, combined with test scores and zip code, reportedly gives schools a picture of how likely a particular student is to apply, and to attend if accepted. The Post reported that many schools use this data to assign a student a score out of 100, rating how likely they are to attend.\n\nSeeing how long students spend on pages of the website gives the school information about a student. For example, they can infer that students who spend more time on the financial aid page are more likely to need financial aid, according to The Washington Post. Schools can use this information to court students who can pay full price, and help them balance their budgets.\n\nMost students do not know that their web activity could be tracked when visiting a college's website, and for some schools there is no way to opt out.\n\n\"You have a choice of not interacting at all,\" State University of New York Buffalo State College chief information officer told The Post. She explained that students who don't wish to be tracked could get information other ways, like by calling the school or using other third-party websites that have information about colleges. Students can also email her directly to request not to be tracked, she said, although the issue the Post highlights is that many students don't know that they're being tracked in the first place.\n\nSUNY Buffalo State, Capture Higher Ed, and Ruffalo Noel Levitz did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "description": "Colleges are hiring private consulting firms to track students who visit their websites and build profiles on them, a new report from The Washington Post reveals.", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da8ce264af9092ea8481783?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
