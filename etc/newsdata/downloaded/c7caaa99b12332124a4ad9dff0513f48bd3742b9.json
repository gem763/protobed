I don\u2019t know why they say that, but that\u2019s what some people say,\u201d Sanders joked in a conversation with Yahoo News last Thursday.\n\nSanders, a Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate, has long disdained what he views as \u201cpolitical gossip\u201d and sought to focus on policy. This is clearly part of why he hasn\u2019t made his personal story a bigger part of his campaign, but his writing suggests that the pain his family went through in Brooklyn, including the death of his mother when he was 18, was part of what led him to leave New York City for Vermont. The family\u2019s story has also been a driving force behind Sanders\u2019s progressive politics.\n\nWhile Sanders doesn\u2019t make his personal story a cornerstone of his campaign, he made clear in a rare interview about his immigrant roots that the experience deeply influenced his outlook, even if he now claims New England as his home.\n\n\u201cI spent the first 18 years of my life in Brooklyn, I went to school in Brooklyn, I went to PS 197, went to James Madison High School, spent a year at Brooklyn College, so obviously Brooklyn is an important part of my life,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSanders\u2019s parents were both part of the exodus of Jews who left Eastern Europe for the United States. His father, Eli, came from Stopnica, which is in modern-day Poland. Sanders\u2019s mother, Dorothy, was born in New York City to parents who came from Russia and Poland. Immigration documents, which Yahoo News shared with Sanders, showed that his father came to New York in 1921 at the age of 17 onboard a ship called the Lapland. Passenger manifests listed his father as \u201cEliasz Gitman.\u201d Sanders said that as with many Jewish immigrants, his father\u2019s name was \u201cchanged along the way\u201d as he was naturalized.\n\nSanders's father came to New York in 1921 at the age of 17 onboard a ship called the Lapland (pictured). (Photo: Ancestry.com) More\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Sanders has vowed to enact comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and the so-called Dreamers, who were brought to the U.S. as children. Sanders, who has called for decriminalizing illegal immigration, also pledged to end President Trump\u2019s child-separation policy and called for enacting a \u201chumane border policy,\u201d including \u201cfundamentally restructuring\u201d the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nFor Sanders, his family\u2019s history \u201cmakes the issue of immigration very personal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the proud son of an immigrant. And I think it is clear that we have got to stop the demonization of immigrants right now. Immigrants to a large degree are the people doing the hard work in this country: doing the agriculture, planting the crops, picking the crops,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the people who are doing some of the most important work in this country and being underpaid in the process of doing it.\u201d\n\nSanders accused Trump of seeking to \u201cdemonize people because they were not born in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat clearly is something that I take personally,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders\u2019s family lived in a three-and-a-half-room rent-controlled apartment in Midwood, a Brooklyn neighborhood that had a large Jewish immigrant population at the time. Sanders said his family \u201call spoke Yiddish,\u201d the language of many Jewish immigrants.\n\n\u201cMy father learned English ... pretty well. He did not have an accent. My grandmother always had a very heavy accent,\u201d he recounted.\n\nYiddish is known for colorful phrases. Sanders turned to the best-known Yiddishism when asked how he might use the language to describe Trump.\n\n\u201cOy vey,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s father worked as a paint salesman, and his mother raised the senator and his brother, Larry. The family faced financial struggles, but his parents put the two children through Hebrew school.\n\nSanders didn\u2019t exactly take those religious studies seriously.", "description": "Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t make his personal story a cornerstone of his campaign, but in a rare interview about his immigrant roots, he made clear it deeply influenced his outlook.", "authors": ["Hunter Walker", "White House Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3YsjmvGRhFwGWyJN2fHYoA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/411b45d0-d333-11e9-af9d-890adf67b482", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
