Just under a quarter of Republicans, 23%, said they were \"very ready\" or \"extremely ready\" for a woman president.\n\nThinking ahead to the 2020 general election, 58% said that it would be either much harder, moderately harder or slightly harder for a woman to win against Donald Trump as opposed to a male candidate. About a quarter, 24%, said it would be much harder.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook and the founder of LeanIn, said that the poll highlights important internal views.\n\n\"It's vital that we understand how biased thinking affects elections, so we can correct for it,\" Sandberg said in a statement about the poll.\n\nMichael Reynolds/AP\n\nThere are currently five women running for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 race: Sens. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and author Marianne Williamson. Two party nominees were women in 2016: Clinton and Jill Stein, of the Green Party.\n\nThomas said that between those numbers, and the historic number of women elected in the 2018 midterms, there are clear signs of an upward trajectory.\n\n\"I generally do think readiness for a woman president is going up in this country and I think it's exciting,\" Thomas told ABC News.\n\n\"I do think we've been softening the ground and people are getting more comfortable with the idea of women in leadership positions in politics. There's been amazing women leaders for years, but I do think we've seen some great progress over the past several years, and we don't want to lose momentum,\" she added.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
