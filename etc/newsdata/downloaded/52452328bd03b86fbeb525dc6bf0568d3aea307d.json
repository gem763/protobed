The fact that Boris Johnson\u2019s spin doctors have had to confirm at such an early stage in his premiership that he is not going to resign is just one of them: it does feel like the wheels are coming off already, and he is yet to have his first personal scandal in office.\n\nHaving already lost his majority, his first vote in the Commons and sacked 21 of his own MPs (a guerrilla army who will now feel they have little left to lose), Mr Johnson also fell into the unfamiliar territory of being beaten up by the \u201cMarxist\u201d Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister\u2019s questions, their first tussle. The leader of the House of Commons made a fool of himself by striking a languorous pose on the Treasury bench, as if posing for an Edwardian-era caricature by Leslie Ward (\u201cSpy\u201d), or, as it turned out, a torrent of memes on social media.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAfter Mr Johnson\u2019s lacklustre performance in the house, in which he was humiliated by Sikh MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Sajid Javid, Mr Johnson\u2019s new chancellor, was twice upbraided by the speaker for straying from his subject during the spending review, and found himself suffering some magisterial put-downs from his shadow, the \u201cMarxist\u201d John McDonnell.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s misery was made complete when Mr McDonnell made an unkind wisecrack about the row the prime minister had had with his girlfriend a few weeks ago. More justifiably, Mr McDonnell poured scorn on the treatment of the chancellor\u2019s media adviser, Sonia Khan, sacked without the chancellor\u2019s knowledge by Dominic Cummings, and marched out of Downing Street by an armed police officer. To be fair to Mr Javid, it was not an episode anyone could justify. It certainly won\u2019t be featuring in any HR handbooks as a paradigm of good management.\n\nIndeed the malign influence of Mr Cummings seems to seep into every pore of the governments travails. It is not simply his arrogant and dismissive persona, his unnecessarily harsh demands or rough ways that are the problem, regrettable though these are. David Cameron famously called him a \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d and, as the public has grown to know more about him, the former prime minister\u2019s description seems to have some accuracy to it.\n\nYet the real problem with Mr Cummings is that, despite his undoubted intelligence, his intellectual curiosity, and his formidable work ethic, he and the rest of the gang seem prone to tactical errors. So, yes, as Mr Cummings would not like to be reminded, he is being outsmarted by Dominic Grieve, Hilary Benn, Sir Oliver Letwin and other mere \u201cpoliticians\u201d.\n\nThe prorogation of parliament, for example, was supposed to mean that MPs would be less able to pass any awkward legislation about obstructing a no-deal Brexit. The effect, however, was quite different. Duly galvanised by the narrowing of the window, and wary of the government\u2019s intentions, MPs took the earliest possible opportunity to put their legislation on the statute book. Attempts to filibuster the bill in the Lords, or to persuade Buckingham Palace to delay the royal assent will not succeed, and do not deserve to. A threat to create 100 Brexit-supporting peers is bizarre, and impractical, given how many days the Lords will be sitting (because of the prorogation) and how many can be made to perform the arcane rituals of the peerage in a working day.\n\nRemoving the whip from the Conservative rebels makes the party look more divided and extremist \u2013 and less electable. More to the point for ministers, it also means that men and women who have had their political careers summarily ended will be even more likely to go rogue on the back benches and, when the time comes, stand in their own right as independent Conservatives and split the vote in various constituencies. The sacking of MPs was a \u201cruthless\u201d gesture that will prove badly counterproductive.\n\nMuch the same can be said for the refusal to publish the Yellowhammer dossier and other Brexit-related briefings. The absence of fact merely creates a vacuum into which fear flows, ironically enough.\n\nCalling for an election, as Mr Johnson does so often, and being unable to then hold one is not a sign of a premier in charge of events. Promising to deliver Brexit by 31 October, \u201cdo or die\u201d, and then failing to \u2013 now almost certain \u2013 will also make the electorate wonder what, exactly, Mr Johnson is for, what on earth has happened to the Conservative Party, and why livelihoods are being jeopardised by someone called Dominic Cummings. He is becoming the story, and not a particularly helpful one.", "description": "Not a good day, then, for the government, but a very good one for parliament \u2013 holding ministers to account, and taking control of its own destiny.
