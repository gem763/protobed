The police have confirmed she is missing - apparently the embassy is closed until Monday.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be any urgency. Her friend is still there as they were due to leave the island today, but she hasn't left because Amelia is missing.\"\n\nRyan Harris, 18, was part of Ms Bambridge's group in Cambodia and said she \"should have come back by now\".\n\nHe said: \"She was one of the first people I met over here about a week ago.\n\n\"I met her in Phnom Penh and we got the boat to Koh Rong, we all spent a few days together and met up with a few other people in a big group.\n\n\"We went on to a neighbouring island but she stayed there with another girl I know who had travelled with us on the boat over.\n\n\"I then had to travel back to Koh Rong after leaving my passport at the hostel and when I got there two people told me she had gone missing.\n\n\"I assumed she would turn up but I have since travelled another 12 hours on a bus to Siem Reap and she still has not been found. She is supposed to be in Siem Reap by now.\n\n\"From my experience I would say it is out of character for her not to come back after a few hours and it is a small island.\n\n\"Even if you go your separate ways after a few drinks you see people again ten or 20 minutes later. She should have come back by now.\"\n\nAmelia's brother, Harry, posted on Facebook: \"For all the religious people can you please do me a big favour and pray for my sister Amelia Bambridge.\n\n\"I'm about to board a plane from LA as she's been missing on her travels in Cambodia for over 48 hours now.\n\n\"I've asked who ever might be up there, to look after her for just another 20 hours and her big brother will be there as soon as I can be. Thanks for everyone who's showed their support, especially to my family back home.\"\n\nA Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: \"We are assisting the family of a British woman who has been reported missing in Cambodia and are in close contact with the Cambodian police.\"", "description": "The family of a 21-year-old backpacker who has gone missing in Cambodia are flying out to search for her, after she went missing following a beach party.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cBf9zDfyDKaJnoRLk58Anw--~B/aD0xMjIxO3c9MTk1NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/df7285f14d78715b63c3ef4b941232b4", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
