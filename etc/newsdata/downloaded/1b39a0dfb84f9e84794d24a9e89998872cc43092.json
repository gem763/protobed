In fact, he wrote the book on it.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Mayer is the author of \"100 Baggers: Stocks That Return 100-to-1 and How To Find Them.\" In the book, he details the methodology behind this approach and how it leads to monstrous returns.\n\nNow, amid all the ongoing market turmoil, Mayer sat down with Business Insider to offer his best advice for investors who are participating in this wild ride.\n\nTo start, the qualities he's seeking are: a long time frame, a high rate of return of about 15 to 20%, low multiples, smaller-size companies, and firms associated with an entrepreneur in some way.\n\n\"I think it's better sometimes to look for the characteristics that a lot those 100 baggers share rather than think of a stock that you're going to make 100 times your money because sometimes it's obviously hard to imagine,\" he said.\n\nMayer added: \"Carefully consider what you're buying, and whatever you buy, really ask yourself: Is this something you want to own for the next 10 years?\" he said. \"I think if you do that, you'll screen out a lot of things.\"\n\nMayer also said that while the market looks fully valued, there are still untapped opportunities available for those willing to dig.\n\n\"It's sort of late cycle, and there's this crowded trade to get into stuff that's worked,\" he said. \"There's always pockets of value in things that don't necessarily screen well.\"\n\nThe Howard Hughes Corp. (HHC)\n\nIn June, the Howard Hughs Corp. was trading around $93 dollars per share, down substantially from its year-to-date high of about $116. However, Mayer didn't see that anything had fundamentally changed with the business. As a result, Mayer's interest became piqued \u2014 and he started digging.\n\n\"Howard Hughes doesn't fit any easy box for ETFs to buy because it's not a real-estate investment trust, and it's just sort of an eclectic collection of different properties,\" he said.\n\nSince the company is structured differently than traditional real-estate investment trusts, investors looking for predictable flows of capital may have shunned its issues. This led to a wide underperformance against the real-estate sector.\n\nBut this is exactly where Mayer knew there was untapped value \u2014 and he scooped up shares.\n\nWhen the company realized its structure was impeding investment, it decided to explore a sale \u2014 and Mayer was handsomely rewarded for his efforts. It's already up 36% from those June levels, and the future appears bright: All five Wall Street analysts that cover the stock have a \"buy\" rating.\n\nEchoStar (SATS)\n\nAnother example of Mayer's commitment to uncovering hidden value is his purchase of EchoStar earlier in the year.\n\n\"You have a lot of investments that they've made that don't produce cash, so they're kind of hidden,\" he said.\n\nMayer continued: \"EchoStar had kind of the good business \u2014 which was Hughes Network Systems \u2014 growing nicely, good margins, etc. And then they had kind of bad business \u2014 which was this slowly melting ice cube \u2014 they had some business with Dish.\"\n\nMayer recognized this hidden fallacy instantly \u2014 and trusted management would take action to stop the bleeding.\n\nHis inkling turned out to be right. EchoStar made the decision to transfer the flailing Dish portion of its business back to Dish \u2014 and the stock popped. It's now up 33% since hitting its year-to-date low in March and sports three \"buy\" ratings and one \"neutral,\" along with no \"sells.\"\n\nAll it took was a little digging to reap the rewards.", "description": "Chris Mayer, the portfolio manager and cofounder of Woodlock House Family Capital, says it's time to look for under-the-radar stocks.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/59fb699a58a0c11e008b5da7?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
