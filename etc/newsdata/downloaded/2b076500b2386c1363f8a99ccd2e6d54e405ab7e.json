He said Governors Island, which is less than a mile from Wall Street, should become a \"visible representation of what these issues we're going to be confronting are\".\n\nThe city asked outside consultants to come up with specifics about what that might look like, as well as a \"pitch deck\" the city could use to sell the idea to foundations, universities or other possible partners. New York wants that work finished within six weeks, according to the document, so that it can solicit bids from developers by the end of next year.\n\nAn aerial view Iwan Baan/The Trust for Governors Island\n\nThe goal is to make the island \"a living laboratory in how you deal with these issues in an urban context,\" said Alicia Glen, who was deputy mayor until earlier this year and is now head of the board of the Trust for Governors Island, which oversees the island.\n\nThe project is also meant to pay for the island's maintenance, Ms Glen said, which is now funded from city coffers. \"The reason why there are development opportunities on the island is to generate money that will allow it to be sustainable,\" she said.\n\nTurning the island into a centre for climate-adaptation research could also tap into New York's concentration of workers in design, engineering, architecture and other related areas, while engaging the public on those risks, according to Clare Newman, who succeeded Mr Samuelian as the trust's president. \"It's a potential opportunity here to bring those strands together,\" she said.\n\nThe city's vision for Governors Island echoes its technology-themed development of Roosevelt Island (which also abuts Manhattan), according to people familiar with the plan. In 2010, New York invited universities to compete for the chance to build a graduate centre for applied sciences on Roosevelt Island; the winner was Cornell University, which in 2017 opened a campus there in partnership with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.\n\nAs for Governors Island, while a prudent approach might have been not to develop there at all, Mr Samuelian said there is more value in making the island an example of how development can coexist with rising water. That could hypothetically involve buildings elevated on stilts, or structures that could easily be dismantled and moved.\n\n\"The city is a waterfront city, and our DNA is the water,\" Mr Samuelian said. \"We can't ignore it.\"\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Governors Island, just off Manhattan, could be developed into a \"living laboratory\" for coping with the effects of climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6622%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_107/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4d7ee02905c2d9b3b54034b8898671ee2734ae94", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
