I understand it: We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from. Like me, I\u2019m sure that Vindman has the same affinity.\u201d Vindman is a U.S. citizen who left Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, when he was three years old.\n\nSeveral congressional Republicans spoke out in defense of Vindman, who received a Purple Heart after he was wounded by an IED in the Iraq War.\n\nLiz Cheney of Wyoming, a top Republican in the House, said that \u201cquestioning the patriotism, questioning the dedication to country of people like Vindman . . . and others who have testified\u201d is \u201cshameful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation,\u201d Cheney said at a GOP leadership press conference. \u201cIt is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in that process.\u201d\n\nIowa GOP senator Joni Ernst said Vindman was an \u201chonorable man\u201d and that the attacks on him were \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s a Purple Heart. I think it would be a mistake to attack his credibility,\u201d South Dakota\u2019s John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, told Politico. \u201cYou can obviously take issue with the substance and there are different interpretations about all that stuff. But I wouldn\u2019t go after him personally. He\u2019s a patriot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to question the patriotism of any of the people coming forward,\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd, disgusting, and way off the mark. This is a decorated American soldier and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands,\u201d Utah senator Mitt Romney said of attacks on Vindman.\n\nIn addition to former congressman Sean Duffy\u2019s comments, Rudy Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, tweeted: \u201cANOTHER SCHIFFTY BACKFIRE: A US gov. employee who has reportedly been advising two gov\u2019s? No wonder he is confused and feels pressure.\u201d\n\nGiuliani was referring to a report in the New York Times that Ukrainian officials sought advice from Vindman on how to deal with pressure from Giuliani, who is not a government official.\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham raised the issue of Vindman\u2019s conversations with Ukrainian government officials during her show on Monday night, saying that Vindman was \u201cadvising Ukraine while working inside the White House apparently against the president\u2019s interest and usually they spoke in English. Isn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d\n\nFox panelist John Yoo, a law professor and former Bush administration official, replied: \u201cI find that astounding, and some people might call that espionage.\u201d\n\nYoo later claimed he was accusing the Ukrainians but not Vindman of engaging in espionage:\n\nI want to clear up a misconception of my remarks on the Laura Ingraham show last night. I did not accuse Lt. Col. Vindaman of committing the crime of espionage. I have tremendous respect for a decorated officer of the U.S. Army and a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. What I was addressing was a report that Ukrainian officials had sought to contact Vindaman for advice on how to handle Rudy Giuliani acting as a presidential envoy. I meant to say that this sounded like an espionage operation by the Ukrainians. I think it deliberately misconstrues my words to say that the separate issue of the phone call between the US and Ukrainian president through the chain of command constitutes espionage by Vindaman, or that Vindaman is some kind of double agent.\n\nSean Duffy also tried to clean up his comments later on Tuesday. \u201cLt. Col. Vindman is an American war hero. As I said clearly this morning on air \u2018I salute Mr. Vindman\u2019s service.\u2019 My point is that Mr. Vindman is an unelected advisor, he gives ADVICE. President Trump sets the policy,\u201d Duffy said, without directly addressing his comments about Vindman\u2019s ethnicity and his doubts about Vindman\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d for \u201cAmerican policy.\u201d", "description": "Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council staffer and key witness in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, was accused by former Republican congressman Sean Duffy of having dual loyalty to the United States and Ukraine.\u201cIt seems very clear that [Vindman] is incredibly concerned about", "authors": ["John Mccormack"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VtiHS7X5El2AkGwdkWSA2A--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/2bf56daadb8f9336df11ffe91633995d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
