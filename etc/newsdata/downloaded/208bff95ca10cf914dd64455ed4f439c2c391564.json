from failed suicide attempts to severe social anxiety \u2013 along with typical chatter about their daily life and hopes for the future.\n\nBut the criminal investigation centred on the weeks leading up to Conrad\u2019s death, in which he told Carter that he was serious about taking his own life and she suggested when, where and how to do it.\n\nThe documentary shows the prosecution\u2019s struggle to prove that Carter\u2019s messages to Conrad \u2018coerced\u2019 him\n\nRoy's body was found in his car in 2014\n\n\u2018What about hanging yourself or stabbing yourself?\u2019 she texted him in 2014, and the next day: \u2018Why don't you just drink bleach?\u2019\n\nThe documentary shows the prosecution\u2019s struggle to prove that Carter\u2019s messages to Conrad \u2018coerced\u2019 him, especially when she began texting him on a daily basis to \u2018just do it\u2019 and \u2018do it today\u2019 and was known to have been the last person to call on him on the night he died.\n\nFrom the defence, it\u2019s argued that the texts showed Conrad was always going to kill himself, with or without Carter\u2019s help.\n\nAfter all, the teenager had already attempted suicide four times before he was found dead in 2014, making his first attempt when he was just 16.\n\nHe struggled with depression, social anxiety and 'liking himself,' ultimately telling Carter that his \u2018unbearable\u2019 life put him in in the \u2018worst pain\u2019.\n\nThere\u2019s also the legal argument that Massachusetts was one of only 11 US States at the time that did not have a law criminalising assisted suicide.\n\nThe defence argued that the texts showed Conrad was always going to kill himself, with or without Carter\u2019s help\n\nAnd more to the point, how could Carter have physically caused Conrad\u2019s death when she was nowhere near the scene?\n\nThe documentary also asks tough questions about Carter\u2019s ongoing mental health treatment, and whether or not her psychiatric medication impaired her ability to decide what was best for Conrad.\n\nFollow I Love You, Now Die to the final conviction, which is hinged on Carter\u2019s final phone calls with Conrad, in which she previously \u2018confessed\u2019 to telling him to \u2018get back in\u2019 his vehicle while it was filling up with toxic fumes.\n\nWith no records of what was actually said in those final phone calls, the court must decide whether her words caused her boyfriend\u2019s death, when she could have used them to call for help, or whether Conrad\u2019s suicide was inevitable, with or without his girlfriend\u2019s words of encouragement.\n\nTune into brand new channel, Sky Crime, from 1 October\n\nBrand new channel, Sky Crime, the new home of true crime, is available now.
