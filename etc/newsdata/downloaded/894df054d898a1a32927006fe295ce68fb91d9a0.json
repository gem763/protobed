We made mistakes in the two areas which didn't allow us to close the game out and not concede goals,\" Pioli said. \"It's time to stop talking about a 'young Milan' or 'old Milan.' We're Milan and we've got to wear this shirt with honor and pride.\"\n\nHakan Calhanoglu had put Milan ahead early on before Khouma Babacar equalized with a penalty after the break. Calhanoglu also set up a goal for Krzysztof Piatek, who broke out of a scoring slump. Marco Calderoni scored the final goal for Lecce in stoppage time.\n\n\"We should have closed the match earlier,\" Pioli said. \"We deserved to win but we didn't get the three points due to our own faults. We weren't attentive on their second goal.\"\n\nAC Milan's Krzysztof Piatek, left, and AC Milan's Hakan Calhanoglu react at the end of Serie A soccer match between AC Milan and Lecce, at the San Siro stadium in Milan, Italy, Sunday, Oct.20, 2019.

That's what we're still lacking.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/AndrewDampf\n\nAC Milan's manager Stefano Pioli looks on at the start of Serie A soccer match between AC Milan and Lecce, at the San Siro stadium in Milan, Italy, Sunday, Oct.20, 2019.
