The 27-year-old Hatton has three European Tour wins in is career, including 2017's Italian Open. He tied for sixth in the 2018 U.S. Open and also tied for sixth in The Open Championship this past year.", "description": "Tyrrell Hatton was far from happy with one spectator who created a loud noise shutting a port-a-potty door .
