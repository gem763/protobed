It was a sunny day in July and environmental activists had blocked the Strand with a big blue boat.\n\n\u201cLive from the royal courts of justice,\u201d Extinction Rebellion London wrote. \u201cIt has been announced that all protesters arrested during the April rebellion will be prosecuted. We are asking the police and legal system to concentrate on issues such as knife crime, and not non-violent protesters who are trying to save our planet.\u201d\n\nFor those with ears tuned to hear it, the dogwhistle sounded clear. Stop bothering us non-violent protesters; focus instead on those frightening inner-city neighbourhoods, where black children carry knives.\n\n\u201cIt was feeding into a racist narrative,\u201d says Guppi Bola, an activist with the Wretched of the Earth, an environmental group that focuses on black, brown and indigenous voices. \u201cWhen those kinds of things come up, then of course you are not going to feel welcome.\u201d\n\nIn less than a year, Extinction Rebellion (XR) has established itself as one of the UK\u2019s highest-profile environmental campaign groups. Its mass civil disobedience protests have helped raise concern over green issues to a record high.\n\nIts representatives have met government ministers and spoken to MPs. On Monday, it promises to start shutting down Westminster \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d to achieve its three main goals: for the government to tell the truth about the climate emergency; for the UK to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025; and for citizens\u2019 assemblies to devise policy to tackle the crisis.\n\nBut from the start XR has faced questions over its ability to reach out to diverse communities. Some critics go further, suggesting its tactics, its framing of key issues and a series of communications missteps show a carelessness around issues of race \u2013 or even institutional racism.\n\nAs climate anxiety increases, XR says it has listened to the criticisms and is prepared to make changes in order to reach as many people as possible.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police officers remove an Extinction Rebellion activist from Waterloo Bridge in central London.

And what can be done to change it?\n\nXR\u2019s lack of diversity is not unique to the wider environmental movement \u2013 a \u201cwhite middle-class ghetto\u201d, in the words of one NGO chief, with research in 2017 finding the \u201cenvironment profession\u201d \u2013 including workers at green NGOs \u2013 was the second least diverse of all sectors in the UK, after farming.\n\nSo when a small group of activists got together in a Stroud living room last year to found a radical environmental movement, it was no surprise that they were white, or that they have gone on to create a movement in their own image.\n\nWith many of its key activists from rural or semi-rural areas, Extinction Rebellion rolls into town like the left wing of the Countryside Alliance. The protest culture of its core supporters is rooted in a new age hippy aesthetic of paisley robes, circus skills, camping, roll-ups and psytrance music.\n\n\u201cOutside of environmental thinktanks and environmental organisations, grassroots organising is often very isolating for people of colour, particularly in the kinds of cultures or activities that are decided on,\u201d Bola said.\n\n\u201cThey lack inclusive cultures.\u201d Protest groups often meet in pubs, which can be alienating for Muslims, she points out. Actions often involve \u201cconditions people are not very comfortable with\u201d, such as hiking or camping. Britons from an ethnic minority background are less likely to visit the natural world, research suggests \u201cthey might not have the kit\u201d.\n\nSo while people from black and minority ethnic groups have been spokespeople for XR, and have taken part in actions, Metropolitan police statistics show that nine in 10 of the 1,100 activists arrested in the group\u2019s April protests in London were white \u2013a city in which four in 10 residents are not.\n\nInstead of using your privilege to get arrested, how about using it to stop other people getting arrested\n\nA central plank of XR\u2019s campaign strategy is to sacrifice as many activists to arrest as possible. Its supporters use a range of non-violent tactics to cause disruption and gain attention, then \u2013 in contrast to protest movements of the past \u2013 they allow themselves to be arrested without resistance.\n\nThey believe it is because of that sacrifice \u2013 the willingness to be arrested and go to prison \u2013 that people will take their message seriously. But it is a strategy that many black activists say they cannot adopt.\n\n\u201cThe way they conceptualise the police and the state, and being arrested, alienates a lot of people of colour, a lot of migrant people,\u201d said Susuana Amoah, an environmental activist from Brighton who has run workshops on the green movement\u2019s approach to race.\n\n\u201cThey have so much faith in the system to be on their side and not send them to prison, or not send them to prison for long. And the bravery around that. People of colour can\u2019t do that. It won\u2019t happen for us.\n\nIn an open letter published in May, XR was challenged by the Wretched of the Earth to rethink its message and strategy to take into account \u201can ongoing analysis of privilege, as well as the reality of police and state violence\u201d.\n\nBola helped to draft that letter. \u201cI do remember the response from XR\u2019s Twitter \u2026 which was \u2018people of colour are more harshly impacted by a police society and the judicial system and so it is the role of white people to stand up for them and take the lead\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Um, I mean, I guess so\u2019. And I guess in a strategic, well-organised aligned action that would involve people of colour at the start of the decision-making process.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Doctors stage a die-in outside the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in central London.

As a result, no one apparently thought to raise the alarm when the committee drafting the group\u2019s founding document \u2013 a \u201cdeclaration of rebellion\u201d read out in Parliament Square last November \u2013 decided it should raise fears of \u201cmass migration\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is a real threat of far-right xenophobia being fuelled through the narrative of climate change,\u201d Bola said. The fear is that such rhetoric could prefigure a populist turn to eco-fascism \u2013 an end that Gail Bradbrook, XR\u2019s co-founder, has said is among her greatest fears for the future.\n\nAt the core of XR\u2019s message is the idea that humanity is running out of time. \u201cIf we do not act now, we face extinction,\u201d one early press release asserted. \u201cAt the very least we will witness the breakdown of society as we know it.\u201d But as critics have pointed out, the very real effects of climate change and environmental destruction are already being felt by billions of people.\n\n\u201cExtraction of the Alberta tar sands has been happening for 50 years,\u201d said Suzanne Dhaliwal, whose No Tar Sands campaign was the first in the UK to highlight the struggles of indigenous people in Canada.\n\n\u201cSo when you talk about it as some future situation it means that the responsiveness to climate catastrophes and events isn\u2019t even thought of as part of consciousness work. It\u2019s all about white middle-class people protesting about something that might happen.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A climate change activist is surrounded by police officers outside the Treasury building this month. Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty\n\nPriyamvada Gopal, an Oxford University don and antiracism campaigner, said: \u201cThere has certainly been a perception among people of colour that [XR] is white-led and sometimes inadequately cognisant of concerns around race, migration, empire and so on.\n\n\u201cHowever, my sense is also that because it is a growing movement that is bringing different kinds of people onboard, particularly younger people, important discussions around race and geopolitics are starting to happen and that is welcome.\u201d\n\nOne of those younger people is Daze Aghaji. She says XR has suffered from its lack of diversity and has made mistakes, particularly in its early stages, but she points out they were more the result of ignorance than malice. In particular, she says, critics have misunderstood XR\u2019s mass-arrest strategy.\n\n\u201cThe idea of being arrestable and non-arrestable, people think [these] are problematic terms, but they\u2019re not,\u201d said Aghaji. \u201cFor example, I\u2019m personally non-arrestable, and this is a decision that should be made by every individual. I understand that, being a black woman, the police are not going to [treat me the] same as a 40-year-old white woman. So I\u2019m not going to put myself in that position. And within XR you\u2019re not forced to.\u201d\n\nAs a black woman, the police are not going to treat me the same as a 40-year-old white woman Daze Aghaji\n\nAccording to Aghaji, more diversity can be found within XR\u2019s youth wing. \u201cXR Youth is really based on talking about indigenous communities, and the global south is our centring of what we talk about and how we express ourselves. And the way we connect to the climate emergency is very much in the line of more climate justice than the main XR.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, at a press briefing for XR\u2019s planned mass demonstrations that start on Monday, activists from ethnic minorities were much more prominent. The event was opened by the Asian environmentalist Zion Lights, who spoke of the struggles of indigenous communities. Next week\u2019s demonstrations will also include a \u201cclimate justice\u201d bloc, where activists explicitly draw the connections between ecological destruction, racism and inequality.\n\nOthers are also trying to force change from within. When the movement expanded to the US, activists there decided to include a further demand to the three that were laid out at the group\u2019s inception in the UK: for a \u201cjust transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice.\u201d Now activists are agitating to have that demand included in XR UK\u2019s agenda.\n\nAround the world it is the poorest and the blackest who are suffering the worst effects of the destruction of the natural world. More than 90% of pollution deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa. In England, it is the most ethnically diverse neighbourhoods that are the most polluted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Benjamin Zephaniah, a radical poet, says change will not happen until people of colour join the climate protests. Photograph: John Robertson/The Guardian\n\nYet people of colour in Britain remain less environmentally conscious than their white counterparts. Research last year by the NUS showed that students who identified as other than white were less likely to engage with environmental issues, and less likely to have changed their behaviour \u2013 such as using reusable cups \u2013 out of environmental concerns.\n\nIt is a tendency that Benjamin Zephaniah, the radical poet, musician and activist, has encountered through his work in universities. \u201cMost of the black students and the Asian students are saying my priority is just to stay safe and get on, and get this grade, and kind of better my family, and move on,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt frustrates me because I want to tell them that it\u2019s all connected. What good is your grade if you\u2019ve got no planet?\u201d\n\nZephaniah does not lay blame at the feet of climate activists for failing to reach out. \u201cOK, it\u2019s a lot of mainly young white people getting together and they\u2019re protesting in a way that\u2019s culturally relevant to them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them for that. If they started growing dreadlocks and saying, \u2018Yeah people, come join us\u2019 you would claim cultural appropriation. They are doing it how it\u2019s culturally relevant to them, that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying we should take our steel bands down, we should take our sound systems down.\u201d\n\nZephaniah points out that change is not going to come without people of colour joining the demonstrations. \u201cWhat would Malcolm X think of this? We\u2019re sitting around, waiting for white people to invite us in the struggle.\u201d", "description": "Critics say group is not doing enough to involve people of colour, or expose links between climate crisis and inequality", "authors": ["Damien Gayle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28696a73b1c885832becf320674415db7622c5e9/0_134_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c9b2eccbef6d60b9b6d8b2e05c01583d", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
