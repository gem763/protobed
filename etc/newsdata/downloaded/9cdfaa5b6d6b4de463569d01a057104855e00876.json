His family worries the DA is 'anti-gay'\n\nMANCHESTER, Tenn. \u2013 A teen's suicide has sparked a call by his family for criminal charges against two classmates who outed the teen prior to his death.\n\nChanning Smith, 16, died by suicide the night of Sept. 22 after intimate messages between him and another boy were shared on Instagram and Snapchat.\n\nOn his final Instagram post, Smith wrote a cryptic message to his followers.\n\n\"I'm gonna get off social media for awhile,\" he wrote. \"I really hate how I can't trust anyone because those I did were so fake. Bye.\"\n\nThe next morning at 4 a.m., his father saw light peeking underneath his son's door. Concerned, he opened the door to find Channing's body.\n\nJoshua Smith, his brother, said Channing hadn't been open with many about his sexual orientation, and he said the family is worried about whether the prosecutor, who has come under fire for remarks made about same-sex couples and violence, will consider charges. The prosecutor\u2019s office, however, issued a statement saying it will work with investigators and assess any potential charges.\n\nCoffee County District Attorney Craig Northcott is currently under investigation by the state Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility. He's also been chastised after a 2018 video came to light of the DA addressing a group of pastors. In the video, Northcott said he wouldn't prosecute domestic violence cases involving same-sex couples and did not recognize \"homosexual marriage.\"\n\nSmith said he had to push the Coffee County Sheriff's Department to keep the investigation open and use his brother's phone to help the case.\n\n\"You would think Manchester is anti-gay by some of the comments he's made,\" Smith said. \"And I am sure there are people here he represents who believe that way. But nonetheless, the support of this community has been amazing.\"\n\nIn a written statement, Northcott said his office has not yet made any charging decisions.\n\n\"Procedurally, no charging decisions have been made by my office nor has the Coffee County Sheriff\u2019s Department asked for a decision since the investigation has not been completed,\" Northcott said in his statement.\n\n\"When all relevant facts are available, my office will advise the Coffee County Sheriff\u2019s Department on what charges, if any, we believe are appropriate to help guide it in that decision,\" the statement continued. \"Any report that my office has failed or refused to act is inaccurate and I wanted to clarify this for the sake of the Smith family as they do not need the added burden to the already incomprehensible pain that they are experiencing.\"\n\nOn suicide prevention: If you've ever had suicidal thoughts, make a safety plan\n\nSuicide prevention experts: What you say (and don't say) could save a person's life\n\nCoffee County has only seen two youth suicides from 2013 to 2017, according to the most recent data from the Tennessee Health Department.\n\nSince Smith's death, students in his class and the marching band at Coffee County Central High School have made handmade posters and shirts, where they were displayed at the homecoming pep rally. Residents have shown up to two memorials, including one where Billy Ray Cyrus came to town and sang \"Amazing Grace.\"\n\n\"I am dealing with the fact that the memorials came and went,\" Smith said. \"Just the attention it's got is amazing. Billy Ray Cyrus coming was a miracle. But Manchester has been amazing in its support. We are moving on this week, but we are going to make a push for Channing.\"\n\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline: What actually happens when you call\n\nBe kind to yourself: Self-care tips for folks suffering with thoughts of suicide, stories on how survivors cope\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time of day or night or chat online.
