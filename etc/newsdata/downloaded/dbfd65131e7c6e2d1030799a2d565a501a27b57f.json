We are up against wonderful opposition who we respect but also we are confident and comfortable in our own game plan,\u201d said the former Wales and British and Irish Lions fly-half.\n\n\u201cYou are fully aware it\u2019s a very physical game,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are aware of each other\u2019s game plans.\n\n\u201cWe expect the ball to be kicked a huge amount to us and it\u2019s making sure we deal with that threat, and when we have the ball what we do with it.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Broken bone \u2013\n\nBoth sides have suffered last-minute withdrawals, with Wales full-back Liam Williams and electric Bok winger Cheslin Kolbe ruled out with ankle injuries.\n\nWelsh back-rower Josh Navidi is also out for the tournament, while centre Jonathan Davies has been passed fit after missing the quarter-finals and Hadleigh Parkes has been playing with a broken bone in his hand.\n\n\u201cHe is 100 percent fit, he has trained very well and he is hitting the ball well,\u201d Jones said of Davies.\n\n\u201cHe is getting into position well and his communications are fantastic. There are no issues there and it\u2019s the green light and he is good to go.\u201d\n\nWales had to fight their way into the semis, coming from behind to beat 14-man France 20-19, while South Africa had an easier time in dispatching Japan 26-3.\n\nThe fresher, powerful Springboks are arguably the favourites against Wales, as they look to cap a turnaround under coach Rassie Erasmus by winning their third world title.\n\nSiya Kolisi, South Africa\u2019s first black captain, is in no doubt about the value of a World Cup win in helping to close the country\u2019s divisions.\n\n\u201cI have seen what winning a World Cup does for our country,\u201d said Kolisi, who was 16 when South Africa last lifted the trophy in 2007.\n\n\u201cI am old enough to remember the 2007 World Cup and I remember what it did for the country then and I know what it will do for the country now.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have many different races in our country, and we have 11 official languages\u2026 We have different races in the team as well, which is really beautiful, and I think it\u2019s very important for the country for us to do well, and for us as a team.\n\n\u201cIt just shows that when we decide to work together for one goal as a team or a country, we can make anything happen. We can achieve all our dreams or goals.\u201d", "description": "Yokohama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Six Nations champions Wales lock horns with southern hemisphere kings South Africa on Sunday as they bid to reach their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/8fdd33_wales-are-playing-south-africa-in-world-cup-semi-finals-wales-south-africa-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
