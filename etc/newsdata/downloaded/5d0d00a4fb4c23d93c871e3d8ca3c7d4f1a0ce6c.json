What? Speak up a bit. It isn\u2019t!? A shared series means Australia retain the Ashes? Oh well...\n\nThe destination of the urn may have already been determined before battle commenced in south London but England turning in their most complete performance of the series so far is a welcome sight nonetheless for the majority of patrons inside a packed Oval. A strong day in the field on Friday was backed up by some refreshingly competent batting on Saturday to guide the hosts into a commanding position. It would take a Stokesian feat of escapology for Australia to wriggle free of their current predicament.\n\nJoe Denly has hogged the morning headlines, and most likely another series at the top of England\u2019s batting order, with his slow-burn series ending in impressive fashion. His obduracy, following on from Sam Curran\u2019s tenacity with the ball, have given England a steelier edge, much to Australia\u2019s dissatisfaction. For the first time during this long old tour of theirs they have looked tetchy, bordering on rattled, and ready for the next Qantas home.\n\nWhether they do so as jubilant series winners or content urn retainers will depend on how they occupy the crease over the next couple of days. We know with Steve Smith anything is possible...\n\nI\u2019m around for the hour leading up to play, after which it\u2019s over to Geoff Lemon.
