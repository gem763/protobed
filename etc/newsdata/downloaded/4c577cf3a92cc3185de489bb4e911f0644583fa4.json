We\u2019ve got a pretty good idea of what they will bring, so we will be well prepared.\"\n\nStill, the Boks cannot take anything for granted.\n\n\"Their rugby has improved immensely. They are still classified as a Tier 2 nation, but we don't see them as that at all,\" said De Jager.\n\n\"They went unbeaten in their pool and beat two Tier 1 nations in their pool.\n\n\"So we definitely view them as a Tier 1 nation and a big opponent. Really, the game is going to be challenging on Sunday. What makes them a good side is that they play to their strengths.\n\n\"They identify what their strengths are, and play really well to those strengths. For us, it\u2019s about sticking to what makes us good, and what our strengths (are). It is going to be a good game and a great challenge on Sunday.\"\n\nKick-off is at 12:15 (SA time).", "description": "Lood de Jager believes that the Springboks are far more prepared for Japan this weekend than they were in 2015.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9398/dc20a45f8794433d88e07f3457bf67ce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
