Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThree recent announcements indicate this as a growing trend among publishers, as they seek greater leverage against ad giants Google and Facebook:\n\nIAC's Dotdash \u2014 a digital media company that now owns 10 publishers \u2014 purchasedLiquor.com, its fourth such acquisition this year, per Axios. Earlier this year, it acquired wedding-focused Brides, beauty-focused site Byrdie, and home design and lifestyle-focused site MyDomaine.\n\nVice Media has struck a deal to acquire Refinery29, with the combined company likely to be headed by Vice CEO Nancy Dubuc, per Variety. That combination will bring together two complementary audiences, which could make the two publishers together more attractive to ad buyers looking to reach young people. Both Vice and R29 cater to younger audiences, but they skew male and female, respectively.\n\nBustle Media Group (BMG) is launching a tech-focused news site called Input in November, bringing BMG's total site count to eight, per Digiday. Over the past year, BMG has acquired three properties \u2014 science- and geek-focused site Inverse, culture-focused The Outline, and pop-culture-focused site Nylon in a bid to grow beyond its women-focused audience on the flagship site.\n\nNiche outlets can help publishers both expand their reach and their ability to target ads based on interests \u2014 two of the main advantages tech giants have in winning ad dollars. Google, Facebook, and increasingly Amazon, dominate the digital ad market primarily because they dominate the internet: Google, Facebook, and Amazon are each many internet users' \"front pages\" to the internet, and they each have vast troves of user data.\n\nBy mimicking those core benefits \u2014 interest-based ad targeting at scale \u2014 publisher portfolios can become a proxy for advertising on platforms. For example, Dotdash is bundling its assets into four groups, including \"Health and wellness,\" \"Finance,\" and \"Food, beverage, and home,\" to make it easier to pitch to certain brand categories by interest area. In a similar strategy, BDG's Input will become a part of a group of BDG-owned sites called the \"Culture and Innovation Collection,\" which will provide the company with a \"template\" that will be applied to the rest of BDG's portfolio.\n\nThese publishers will likely still lean on brand safety when pitching brands, but improvements to reach and ad targeting can help them sweeten the pot. Publishers' primary leverage for attracting ad dollars is brand safety relative to the duopoly, because they offer premium content spaces where all content is highly vetted. But with broader audience reach via greater business scale and greater specificity via greater asset diversity, publishers will have an easier time attracting brands and even charging higher premiums.\n\nAlthough subscription models are becoming increasingly in vogue for publishers \u2014 and 52% of publishers say it's their main revenue focus in 2019 \u2014 display advertising remains their most important focus, with 81% of publishers saying it's the most important, compared with 78% who said so for subscriptions, per the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
