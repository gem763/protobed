The two-time CCMA female artist of the year exploded onto the scene back in 2016 with her debut album, Grace & Grit. Fast forward to 2019 and the accolades have significantly piled up. Remarkably, in just three years, she has received 13 CCMA nominations (winning three), two Juno nominations, and 18 CMAO nominations (nabbing 13).\n\nHer highly acclaimed 2018 sophomore release, Country Music Made me do It, earned her a trip to her first Juno Awards where she received the aforementioned nominations for country album of the year and breakthrough artist of the year.\n\nHer new project, Wild as Me, came out on Sept. 6. Patrick says, \"the EP is representative of an evolution. I experienced some of my most extreme highs and lows in the last year and spent more time writing for this project than ever before and dug deeper than ever.\"\n\nComing off her powerful performance at this year's CCMA's in Calgary, Patrick hit the road to promote Wild as Me on a North American radio tour. You'll be able to catch her in concert as she kicks off 2020 with a headlining tour across her home province of Ontario.\n\nShe joined us with her band to perform for a lucky studio audience.
