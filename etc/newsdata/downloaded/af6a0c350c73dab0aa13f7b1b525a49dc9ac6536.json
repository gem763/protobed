Obviously the police were here early on Sunday morning but we haven't yet received any details about whether the kids have been found,' the spokeswoman said.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Northern Territory Police.\n\n'What do we have to do to stop this blatant crime in Darwin,' the owner of the club asked followers and patrons on social media.\n\nHe shared the footage to the business Facebook page in the hope somebody may be able to recognise the vandals who were filmed.\n\nFurious supporters of the golf club called on police to track down the men and prosecute them for breaking into the premises.\n\n'Just goes to show they don't give a stuff about being caught. They know nothing will happen to them,' wrote one.\n\n'If only a couple of Rottweiler's came running around the corner for a midnight snack,' added another.\n\nNone of the men tried to cover their faces or conceal their identity.", "description": "Three young men smashed through a newly installed glass door at the Darwin Golf Club on Saturday night.
