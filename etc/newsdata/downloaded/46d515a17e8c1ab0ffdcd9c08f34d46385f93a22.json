Listen to what he has to say about betting on Week 5. USA TODAY\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 Russell Wilson was in that zone. He would not be denied.\n\nThree times his Seattle Seahawks had needed him to lead them back from a deficit against the visiting Los Angeles Rams, and each time, he had delivered. So, why not do so a fourth time?\n\nTrailing by five with just more than nine minutes to play in Thursday night\u2019s matchup of NFC West foes at CenturyLink Field, Wilson capped a nine-play drive with his biggest throw of the night.\n\nFacing fourth-and-goal from the 5, with 2:34 on the clock, Wilson slipped by two defenders and hopped over another then looked as if he would bolt for the end zone. But then he stopped. His opponents briefly paralyzed, Wilson floated a five-yard toss to running back Chris Carson in the right side of the end zone.\n\nThat play put Seattle up by the deciding 30-29 score following a missed Greg Zuerlein field goal attempt from 44 yards out with only seconds left on the clock. Wilson and Co. emerged with a 4-1 record.\n\n\u201cI thought that Russ \u2014 he stole the show tonight as he did so much. ... (he) played one of the best games I\u2019ve seen him play,\u201d Seattle coach Pete Carroll gushed. \u201cI\u2019ve just never seen him, speaking of magic, all of the plays he came up with his legs, running for one, but also, not to just to get out of trouble, but to find the receivers and make the throws just one after another.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Wilson\u2019s heroic plays just kept coming, one after another.\n\nOn a night when his Seahawks faced their stiffest competition within the division over the last two years, and against team that had represented the gold standard of the NFC as a whole, Wilson was masterful. Legendary even. Pulling off one dizzying escape or one jaw-dropping throw after another while representing the epitome of efficiency while completing 17 of 23 attempts for 268 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nTNF: Seahawks escape with win after Rams' last-minute field goal miss\n\nWEEK 5 PICKS: Cowboys or Packers in battle of 3-1 teams?\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news conveniently delivered to your inbox\n\nRussell Wilson has thrown for 12 TDs with no interceptions through five games this season. (Photo: Joe Nicholson, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cGenerational talent,\u201d Seattle left tackle Duane Brown told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cHe\u2019s playing at an MVP level right now, but he\u2019s been the same guy my whole time I\u2019ve been here.\u201d\n\nThe Seahawks have no question about Wilson\u2019s worth and standing among his peers. Last spring they awarded him a contract extension that made him the highest-paid player in the league with an annual salary of $35 million that tops Ben Roethlisberger, Aaron Rodgers, Matt Ryan, Jarred Goff and Carson Wentz.\n\nLike Wilson, Goff \u2014 who is regarded as one of the league\u2019s next generation of quarterbacks \u2014 also recently received a new deal that exceeds $30 million per season. But as the two faced off Thursday, Wilson left little doubt that he\u2019s on another level.\n\nGoff may do a fine job of getting to the line, surveying the defense and attacking. But when under pressure, he \u2014 like most other quarterbacks in the league \u2014 lacks Wilson\u2019s wizardry.\n\nBut for whatever reason, Wilson often gets overlooked in the discussion of the game\u2019s top-flight quarterbacks.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s only 5 feet, 10 inches tall. Maybe it\u2019s because he directs an offense that utilizes an old school philosophy of establishing the run. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s not often asked to drop back 40 and 50 times a game.\n\nSo what that he doesn\u2019t have the imposing size of a Roethlisberger or Cam Newton. He does have the elusiveness of Michael Vick. His diminutive size enables him to slip through creases and on to daylight.\n\nAny one of his receivers will tell you he\u2019s the best deep-ball thrower in the league. Yet he has such a keen feel for the game that enables him to deftly make any short- or mid-range throw as well.\n\nPatrick Mahomes may dazzle and confound with his cross-body, no-look passes and terrific downfield throws.\n\nBut Wilson\u2019s teammates would like you to remember that their guy has been making mind-blowing plays for nearly a decade now.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing it for so long,\u201d Seattle linebacker Mychal Kendricks explained. \u201cPeople always want what\u2019s new \u2014 the new hot things. But you know what? The proof\u2019s in the pudding. You can look at his stats. They\u2019re there. I\u2019ve played on some other teams and played against Russ and he has that ability to make things happen. He\u2019s a very special dude. \u2026 So happy he\u2019s on my team.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cability to make things happen,\u201d as Kendricks put it, just might be Wilson\u2019s most important attribute of all.\n\nIt stems from his refusal to accept external labels, limitations or defeat. Instead, he finds ways to put the Seahawks on his back again and again and give them the best chance to win.\n\nThursday initially felt like a potentially long night for Wilson and his line as a ferocious Rams defense swarmed the quarterback on each of his first two drives. But late in the first quarter, Wilson found his groove.\n\nMarching his team downfield and into the red zone, Wilson faked a handoff, surveyed the field, sprinted to his left and fired the ball at a spot in the left-back corner of the end zone that only receiver Tyler Lockett could get for a toe-tapping touchdown \u2014 Wilson\u2019s first of the day.\n\nSandwiched between the Lockett pass and the game-winner to Carson, were another half-dozen highlight-worthy throws or runs from the quarterback.\n\nWilson refused to classify any of his breath-taking plays as miraculous. He explained that he has prepared for these very throws since his childhood when he would grab his father\u2019s football from his stint as a practice squad wide receiver for the San Diego Chargers in 1980 and chuck it around the living room at various targets he had set up.\n\n\u201cGod made me for this,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nThen, he explained that as he conducts his artistry on the field, he draws inspiration from another elite athlete.\n\n\u201cI think about Steph Curry,\u201d Wilson said, referring to the Golden State Warriors guard and two-time NBA MVP. \u201cWhen I think about how he shoots the basketball, that\u2019s how I want to throw a football. Put it on the money, make some crazy throws, make some crazy plays. I love watching sports and one of my favorite guys to watch just how he shoots a basketball. You don\u2019t get there by not working at it, by not believing. You\u2019ve got to love the game, love the process overall and that\u2019s how you make it happen.\u201d\n\nBy game\u2019s end, Wilson\u2019s season stat line read 1,409 passing yards, 12 passing touchdowns and zero interceptions.\n\nHe holds the distinction of becoming the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to record 1,400-plus yards, 12-plus touchdowns and no interceptions through his first five games.\n\nBrown said he hopes that now, fans and the so-called experts will begin to take note of Wilson\u2019s body of work.\n\n\u201cI just try to be consistent,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBobby (Wagner) and I have a saying, \u2018Don\u2019t get bored with consistency.\u2019 So, that\u2019s my thing. Just be consistent, stay the course, let wins speak for themselves. It\u2019s about winning. That\u2019s why I come to play the game. It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about winning, about other guys and it\u2019s about us and what we can do.\u201d\n\nWilson only cares that he has his team off to their best start since 2016, which was the last time they won their division. Delivering his team that feat and more will bring Wilson the only validation he seeks.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
