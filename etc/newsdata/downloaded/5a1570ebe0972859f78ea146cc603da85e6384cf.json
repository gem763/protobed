Johnson attempted to redeem himself by claiming that his article was a \u201cstrong liberal defence of everybody\u2019s right to wear whatever they want in this country\u201d. He also claimed to be proud to have Muslim ancestors and that he was also related to Sikhs, in addition to mentioning his diverse cabinet.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Anti-racism charity Tell Mama found there had been a 375 per cent week-on-week increase in Islamophobic incidents since the prime minister\u2019s comments just over a year ago.\n\nHe should not be focusing on any religion at all.\n\nWhile the government\u2019s focus is on the Leave-Remain-Leave-Remain deal-or-no-deal issue, the country is becoming further divided; therefore, any aim to create a more liberal society is failing miserably. Being a liberal society includes embracing a multi-ethnic society and enabling people of different religions to celebrate their own cultures as long as they do not harm anyone, or promote hatred.\n\nThe best leaders are not afraid to admit their weaknesses, learn from them, accept failure and apologise for their mistakes. They seek to understand everyone\u2019s perspective on an issue so that they can offer solutions that benefit everyone. They should be inspiring and influencing people in a positive manner, rather than focusing on maintaining a position of power and undermining others.\n\nJohnson should heed the words of Benjamin Franklin, who said, \u201cNever ruin an apology with an excuse\u201d.\n\nIs it so difficult to say \u201csorry\u201d, Boris Johnson?\n\nRabina Khan is a Liberal Democrat councillor for Shadwell in Tower Hamlets", "description": "Boris Johnson is no longer just the politician renounced for making gaffes and offensive remarks disguised as poor humour; he is Boris Johnson, prime minister.
