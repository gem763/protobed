The news swiftly followed that Brendan Gleeson will play opposite Daniels \u2013 as Donald Trump.\n\nFederal judge orders Trump to hand over eight years of tax returns \u2013 live Read more\n\n\u201cJeff is so perfect for this part,\u201d Billy Ray, who adapted the book and will direct the miniseries, told Deadline. \u201cGreat actor, instant integrity, loads of warmth, intelligence, complexity and gravitas.\n\n\u201cWe talked backstage after I saw him in To Kill a Mockingbird on Broadway, and I knew I was looking at the only person who could play Jim Comey. Lucky for me, he said yes.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing Gleeson\u2019s casting, Ray said in a statement: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger acting challenge than playing Donald Trump. You have to have presence, and a singular kind of dynamism. You also have to have the courage and the will to play Trump\u2019s psychology from the inside out.\n\n\u201cOh, and you have to be spectacularly talented and watchable. Not many actors check all those boxes. Brendan does. I\u2019m ecstatic about this.\u201d\n\nComey was FBI director from 2013 until he was fired by Donald Trump in May 2017, a move inextricably linked to Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry into Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow which former White House strategist Steve Bannon calls in a forthcoming book \u201cmaybe\u201d the biggest mistake \u201cin modern political history\u201d.\n\nComey has become a stringent public critic of the president with an active Twitter presence.\n\nA Higher Loyalty, published in April 2018, deals with the author\u2019s early career in the FBI, his experiences under George W Bush and Barack Obama, his hugely controversial stewardship of the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails amid the 2016 election and his brief but tumultuous service under Trump.\n\nReviewing the book, the Guardian said it \u201cportrays Trump as a cataclysmic threat to the nation. As for Trump\u2019s expectation of personal loyalty, [Comey] puts Trump on par with a mafia don, writing that [a] Trump demand was like a \u2018Cosa Nostra induction ceremony \u2013 with Trump in the role of the family boss, asking me if I have what it takes to be a \u2018made man\u2019.\u2019\u201d\n\nA Higher Loyalty review: Comey is unsparing in his disgust at Trump Read more\n\nCBS bought the rights to Comey\u2019s book after a bidding war last year. Deadline reported on Monday that filming on the miniseries will begin in November, after Daniels finishes a year-long Broadway run in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s hit adaptation of Harper Lee\u2019s classic novel. An air date is yet to be determined.\n\nThe TV version of Comey\u2019s hit Trump book is not alone. The Emmy-winning director Jay Roach, for example, is attached to the screen version of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff.\n\nThat tell-all, the originator of a thriving publishing sector, exploded into the national consciousness and rocked the Trump administration when the Guardian obtained an early copy in January 2018.\n\nComey\u2019s book has sold more than 2m copies. Wolff\u2019s first effort \u2013 he followed up with Siege: Trump Under Fire this year \u2013 surpassed 4m sales.\n\nRoach made the HBO version of Game Change, Mark Halperin and John Heilemann\u2019s book on the 2008 election which tracked how Obama beat John McCain for the White House.", "description": "Adaptation of former FBI director\u2019s memoir A Higher Loyalty to be turned into CBS miniseries with Daniels and Gleeson on board", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79da828a3ed73da3c43fe84e8474688e59217759/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c5b5e31bb3cfa7dba1b37c52b3821e0a", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
