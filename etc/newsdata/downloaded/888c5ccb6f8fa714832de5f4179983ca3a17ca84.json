Democrats are picking up speed in their efforts to impeach him.\n\nThe White House has been in damage control mode \u2014 with limited success.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRegarding Syria, Trump claimed on Twitter on Friday that there was a \u201creally good chance of success\u201d despite his abandonment of the Kurds \u2014 but his actions have garnered condemnation even from many members of his own party.\n\nSimilarly, on Ukraine, Mulvaney sought to back away from what he had originally said about aid being predicated on Ukrainian help investigating the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The aid had never had \u201cany condition\u201d placed upon it, he later insisted.\n\nBut none of that was enough to counter the sense that Trump was straining even the loyalty of a Republican Party that has mostly marched in step with him.\n\nRep. Francis Rooney Laurence (Francis) Francis RooneyThe Memo: Trump's sea of troubles deepens Florida GOP lawmaker says he's 'thinking' about impeachment GOP leader defends Mulvaney amid backlash over quid pro quo comments MORE (R-Fla.) on Friday said he had been \u201cshocked\u201d by Mulvaney\u2019s initial remarks, confirming the quid pro quo that Trump had repeatedly denied.\n\nIn a Washington Post op-ed published on Friday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell: Trump's troop pull back in Syria a 'grave strategic mistake' Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump insists Turkey wants cease-fire | Fighting continues in Syrian town | Pentagon chief headed to Mideast | Mattis responds to criticism from Trump TSA head rules himself out for top DHS job MORE (R-Ky.) called the decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria \u201ca grave strategic mistake.\u201d\n\nOther Trump allies such as Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamGraham says he shares Kurdish 'concerns' over cease-fire Majority of Americans believe Trump's Syria move has damaged US reputation: poll Senate GOP braces for impeachment trial 'roller coaster' MORE (R-S.C.) have also been deeply critical of the move. In the House, most Republicans joined a measure expressing disapproval of the troop withdrawal. The measure passed by 354 votes to 60 on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cEven among his customary allies and supporters, there has been pretty blunt criticism, not only of the policy choice but of the way it was done and the way it is continuing to be done,\u201d said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University.\n\nThe Syria moves also weaken Trump with the GOP at a time when he can least afford it.\n\nVirtually no one expects the Republican-controlled Senate to vote to remove him from office even if he is impeached by the House. But even small cracks in Republican unity could give the Democratic-led impeachment effort a semblance of bipartisanship.\n\nNumerous opinion polls have shown public opinion moving in favor of impeachment since Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiCummings to lie in state at the Capitol House Republicans 'demand the release of the rules' on impeachment Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by National Taxpayers Union \u2014Dem wants more changes to Pelosi drug pricing bill | Ebola outbreak wanes, but funding lags | Johnson & Johnson recalls batch of baby powder after asbestos traces found MORE (D-Calif.) joined that push last month. The catalyst for Pelosi\u2019s shift was the revelation that Trump had pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump knocks Romney as 'Democrat secret asset' in new video Giuliani asked State Dept. to grant visa for ex-Ukraine official at center of Biden allegations: report Perry won't comply with subpoena in impeachment inquiry MORE and his son Hunter on a July 25 phone call.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll conducted this week found a majority of registered voters in favor of an impeachment inquiry (51 percent to 45 percent), and disapproving of Trump\u2019s response to that inquiry (59 percent to 32 percent).\n\nThe same poll found 46 percent asserting that Trump should be removed from office, with 48 percent opposed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump has responded to the turning of the screw in characteristic style.\n\nA meeting with congressional leaders broke up on Wednesday after Trump described Pelosi as either a \u201cthird rate\u201d or \u201cthird grade\u201d politician. As the Speaker and her allies exited, Trump reportedly called out, \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the polls.\u201d\n\nTo his supporters, the president is in his usual combative spirit. To his critics, the same behavior is evidence of a volatility that makes him unfit for the office that he holds.\n\nIn the wake of the White House contretemps, Pelosi said that the president had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d and that \u201cwe have to pray for his health.\u201d\n\nDemocratic strategist Robert Shrum predicted that Trump\u2019s behavior \u201cwill get worse\u201d in the coming weeks because, he contended, \u201che has no capacity to function under pressure.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to the impeachment process, Shrum acknowledged that the president had a \u201csafety net\u201d in the Senate, where GOP senators would be extremely reluctant to oppose Trump for fear of drawing a primary challenge. Trump\u2019s approval ratings with Republican voters remain strong.\n\nBut when it comes to the broader electorate, Shrum argued that Trump faced a \u201cvery steep uphill climb\u201d to reelection.\n\nOne of the oddities of the polling numbers in recent weeks, however, is that Trump\u2019s overall approval ratings have not shifted nearly as much as the numbers on impeachment. On Friday afternoon, Trump stood at 42.6 percent approval and 54.1 percent disapproval in the RealClearPolitics national polling average.\n\nSome Republicans insist that the media underplay the factors that could yet help the president out of his current morass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a split screen,\u201d said GOP strategist Matt Mackowiak. \u201cOne one side, you have Pelosi walking out, people trudging up to Capitol Hill [to testify about Ukraine] and the bipartisan backlash on Syria. But on the other side, the economy remains strong and the president had this immense crowd at his rally in Dallas.\u201d\n\nStill, there is no real doubt that some damage has been done by the succession of developments.\n\nThe confluence of events is leaving even independent observers wondering how the president can stop the downward spiral.\n\n\u201cIn some ways we have seen this movie before,\u201d said Reeher, \u201cbut the movie seems to be moving faster and faster.\u201d\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.", "description": "The swirling troubles around President Trump got deeper this week thanks to a series of missteps", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/memo_trumpdonald_101619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
