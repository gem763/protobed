And so it is with theater/theatre. (Basically: Theatres feel spelling it that way signals they are more in line with European traditions.)\n\nJohn Moore, an arts journalist in Colorado, did a survey in June, finding that of 92 active or recently active theaters in that state, 40 use \u201ctheatre,\u201d 14 use \u201ctheater\u201d and \u201ca healthy number \u2014 38 \u2014 perhaps smartly avoid the word altogether.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2012, New York arts writer Howard Sherman called the spelling quandary \u201cthe most useless argument in theatrical history.\u201d With tongue in cheek, he suggested a solution: theatr.\n\nJohn F. Fisher, president of the Shubert New Haven \u2014 a tryout house in Connecticut that\u2019s hosted over 600 pre-Broadway shows, including such world premieres as \u201cOklahoma,\u201d \u201cSouth Pacific,\u201d \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d starring Marlon Brando \u2014 said he\u2019s followed the debate for years. The Shubert closed in 1976 and when it reopened in 1983, the board chair insisted on changing it to -er.\n\n\u201cWe changed it back to -re before our 100th anniversary in 2014,\u201d John wrote. \u201cIt was originally -re.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJohn said that after debating the spelling with the managing director at Yale Rep \u2014 \u201cwho favored -er as the more predominant usage\u201d \u2014 he did some research, finding that almost all the playhouses on Broadway are theatres, not theaters.\n\nAD\n\nTerence Kuch of Springfield, Va., pointed me to a passage in the 1926 edition of H.W. Fowler\u2019s \u201cA Dictionary of Modern English Usage.\u201d In his entry on words ending in either -re or -er, Fowler, a Brit, noted that Americans were more consistent with their spelling. He wrote: \u201cThe prophecy may be hazarded that we shall conform in time, one word in -re after another changing to -er; but we prefer in England to break with our illogicalities slowly.\u201d\n\nThey haven\u2019t broken with that one yet.\n\nAD\n\nTerence added: \u201cOut of stubbornness, I sometimes pronounce theatre \u2018theee-a-tree\u2019 \u2014 but only to myself.\u201d\n\nHey, we all need a hobby.\n\nWhen the District\u2019s Allan Sacks was a young man, he visited Dublin. \u201cI remember asking the little old Irish lady who ran the B&B for a neighborhood lunch recommendation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI thought she answered \u2018Teeter\u2019s,\u2019 rolling the R. When I couldn\u2019t find it I went back and asked her to spell it. It was Theatre\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThey serve food at playhouses in Ireland?\n\nAllan said Theatre\u2019s turned out to be an Irish pub, with wonderful food and a lovely proprietress who was very kind to the awkward young American.\n\nDennis Van Derlaske of Woodbridge noted that it makes sense that the Kennedy Center\u2019s Eisenhower Theater is spelled with an -er. After all, wrote Dennis, \u201cthe military uses this spelling in their \u2018theaters of operation.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGlen Behrendt of Silver Spring pointed out the mixed message at the Olney Theatre Center. \u201cThey split the difference on British vs. American spelling!\u201d he wrote.\n\nI asked Olney\u2019s director of marketing, Joshua Ford, how come.\n\n\u201cIn a sharply divided America, we at Olney Theatre Center pride ourselves as an institution that can bring people together whether their differences are ideological, generational or spelling,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever you spell it, we think you\u2019ll love our production of \u2018Singin\u2019 in the Rain,\u2019 which opens Nov. 8 and runs through the New Year.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNice plug, Joshua! And of course, what really matters isn\u2019t how you spell theater, it\u2019s that you experience it. We in the Washington area are blessed with an abundance of fine actors; directors; playwrights; set, lighting, prop, sound and costume designers; stage combat coordinators; stage managers and choreographers. Do yourself a favor and see their work.\n\nAD\n\nA Capital idea\n\nAll this theater talk reminded me of the great Pringle-shaped arena that once stood hard by the Beltway in Landover: the Capital Centre. Why not Capital Center?\n\nI asked Jerry Sachs, who was president of the Capital Centre. He said that before the Cap Centre was built, Abe Pollin, his wife, Irene, Jerry and other executives spent two days flying around the country in the private jet of builder Jim Clark, checking out other arenas.\n\nSaid Jerry: \u201cIrene Pollin came up with the thought: \u2018Why don\u2019t we name it the Capital Center?\u2019\u201d\n\nTo which Jerry responded: \u201cLet\u2019s be fancy and make it -re.\u201d\n\nAs Jerry told me: \u201cWe were going to be a different kind of arena, therefore we deserved a special name.\u201d\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.\n\nAD", "description": "As the Bard put it, we are but players on the stage of life.
