And yet, if you explore the quiet back streets and small squares around the European Parliament, you will discover a fascinating mix of food, culture, architecture and history.\n\nTake a lunchtime to walk around the neighborhood and you might begin to form a more positive opinion of this urban district at the heart of the EU.\n\nHere are 12 places that lie no more than 15 minutes from your desk, including an impressive collection of dinosaur bones, Art Nouveau architecture and one of the oldest forests in Europe.\n\n***\n\nOstrich sculptures\n\n1 minute\n\nThere\u2019s no sign. Nothing. No indication why 12 ostrich sculptures stand in Parc L\u00e9opold next to the European Parliament. Seven have their heads buried in the sand, while five are standing up. One English tabloid newspaper saw the birds as symbolizing the European Union, but they it the story wrong.\n\nThe birds were put up as a reminder that the park was originally a zoo, founded back in 1850 but closed in 1877, leaving just two square entrance pavilions on Rue Belliard.\n\nParc L\u00e9opold\n\n***\n\nWiertz Museum\n\n2 minutes\n\nOne of the European Parliament\u2019s strangest responsibilities is to maintain the small Wiertz Museum. A French travel magazine once listed it as one of the most beautiful museums in the world. And you\u2019re in luck, because it turns out almost no one knows about it. Located on a hill behind the Parliament, the museum was built in 1851 as a studio for the Belgian romantic painter Antoine Wiertz.\n\nThe building is a rare example of a perfectly preserved mid-19th century museum, with rooms lit by natural daylight and paintings protected by low brass rails. The collection also contains some horrific works such as \u201cPremature Burial,\u201d in which a terrified man struggles to escape the coffin in which he is about to be buried. Consider yourself warned.\n\nRue Vautier 62\n\n***\n\nDinosaurs in the Museum of Natural Sciences\n\n3 minutes\n\nA short walk up the hill behind the Parliament also gets you to Belgium\u2019s Museum of Natural Sciences. It\u2019s often mobbed with local school kids who have come to see the unique collection of 29 dinosaur skeletons dug out of a Belgian coal mine in 1878. The French-born Belgian paleontologist Louis Dollo labored for several years to reconstruct the dinosaurs and concluded they had mysteriously perished in a bog during the Jurassic period. The find sparked an interest in dinosaurs that would eventually inspire the movie \u201cJurassic Park.\u201d\n\nThe museum also owns a collection of 5,000 butterflies and beetles, along with the skeleton of a Neanderthal man found in a cave near the Belgian village of Spy.\n\nRue Vautier 29\n\n***\n\nAtelier Marcel Hastir\n\n9 minutes\n\nSurrounded by office buildings, Atelier Max Hastir is a strange, abandoned town house in the heart of the EU quarter. It was formerly occupied by the artist Marcel Hastir, who settled here in 1935. Hastir organized meetings of the r\u00e9sistance during World War II, pretending they were art classes. The house was for many years threatened with demolition but is now a protected monument filled with old furniture and Hastir\u2019s paintings. This magical spot is now used for classical concerts, dance performances, art classes and film screenings.\n\nRue du Commerce 51\n\n***\n\nBeer Mania\n\n9 minutes\n\nIt\u2019s an easy walk to this serious beer shop, which stocks more than 400 Belgian beers. It\u2019s also one of the few places in town where you can find the elusive Westvleteren 12 Trappist beer from West Flanders: Once ranked the best beer in the world, it is sold in strictly limited numbers, but Beer Mania can be counted on to have a few bottles in store. There is a small tasting room at the back of the shop where you can try out Belgian specialities like the sour Lambic beers of the Pajottenland, the sublime Cantillon gueuze beers and some of the new experimental craft beers produced by small Belgian breweries.\n\nChauss\u00e9e de Wavre 174\n\n***\n\nMaison Antoine\n\n12 minutes\n\nYou can\u2019t call yourself a local until you have ordered fries at Maison Antoine. People will often tell you this is the best fritkot in Brussels. It\u2019s definitely the most popular, so be prepared to wait in line. Founded by Antoine Desmet back in 1948, it originally occupied an old shack left behind by the German army. It is now based in a modern kiosk on the recently-renovated Place Jourdan. It was here that Angela Merkel picked up sustenance for her team during a prolonged Brexit meeting in 2016. Several local caf\u00e9s, including Chez Bernard, will let you eat your frites on their terrace as long as you buy a drink.\n\nPlace Jourdan 1\n\n***\n\nSt. Boniface\n\n14 minutes\n\nTake an hour to explore the Art Nouveau buildings in the St. Boniface neighborhood of Ixelles. Concentrated on Rue Ernest Solvay and Rue St. Boniface, the narrow town houses were designed by the architect Ernest Solvay around 1900. The buildings are rather plain inside, but the fa\u00e7ades are crowded with Art Nouveau details, including wrought iron balconies, decorated sgraffito panels and stones carved with the architect\u2019s elegant signature.\n\nRue Ernest Solvay\n\n***\n\nSquare Marie-Louise\n\n14 minutes\n\nClear your thoughts with a walk around the beautiful Square Marie-Louise, designed in the 19th century by Belgian architect G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bordiau. After draining the swampy Maelbeek Valley, Bordiau created a romantic pond surrounded by weeping willows and an overgrown artificial grotto. He went on to create two other squares on the sloping site above the river valley. The EU institutions hardly intrude in this quiet neighborhood filled with statues, old trees and Art Nouveau houses.\n\n***\n\nKing Leopold II's Norwegian chalet\n\n15 minutes\n\nNot many people ever walk down the Rue Brederode. It might seem like there is nothing to see along this quiet cobbled lane bordered by the walls of Belgium\u2019s royal palace, but it was once the hub of King Leopold II\u2019s vast African colony. The king ran his private empire from a strange wooden chalet that looks like a Norse mountain hut, built by the Norwegian architect I. A. Knudsen. Joseph Conrad came to this street in October 1889 in search of a job on a Belgian steamship. He went on to write the novel \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d based on the horrors he witnessed in Leopold\u2019s colony.\n\nRue Brederode 10\n\n***\n\nPlaster cast workshop of the Royal Museums of Art and History\n\n15 minutes\n\nNot even a local is likely to know about the plaster cast workshop at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Cinquantenaire Park. Yet this forgotten museum and workshop founded in 1876 is worth a look. You\u2019re free to wander around the storerooms and watch craftsmen creating plaster copies of classical statues like Michelangelo\u2019s David. You might spot a dusty bust of Voltaire on a high shelf, or the beautiful head of a young 15th-century Italian woman made from pristine white plaster. Lying around the vast space are abandoned fragments of medieval saints, classical heads and mysterious broken legs. You can even order your own reproduction from a catalog if you need a winged angel or the head of Lorenzo de Medici in your living space. Open Tuesday to Friday.\n\nParc du Cinquantenaire\n\n***\n\nPetite Rue Malibran\n\n15 mins\n\nThe quiet Petite Rue Malibran is one of a handful of old cobbled lanes that have miraculously survived in Brussels. Originally named Rue des Pucelles, it\u2019s the only surviving stretch of a 15th-century country road that once meandered through open fields. Barely changed since the 18th century, it remains an almost rural corner of Ixelles with whitewashed cottages covered in wisteria and a little park.\n\nPetite Rue Malibran\n\n***\n\nGare du Luxembourg\n\n1 minute, plus 7-minute train ride and short walk\n\nIt\u2019s unexpectedly easy to escape the stress of the EU bubble by going for a ramble or a run in the Brussels forest. You just need to download a train ticket on your phone, check the train timetable and head to Gare du Luxembourg. A seven-minute ride gets you out to the Boitsfort station on the edge of the forest. Walk for just five minutes and you are deep inside ancient beech woods where UNESCO-protected areas of primeval forest have barely changed since the Ice Age.\n\nDerek Blyth is a freelance journalist based in Brussels and the author of a number of books, including \"The 500 Hidden Secrets of Brussels\" and \"Hidden Belgium\" (Uitgeverij Luster, 2018).", "description": "There\u2019s more to Brussels than endless traffic and Eurocrats.", "authors": ["Derek Blyth", "Isabella Borshoff", "Ryan Heath", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/optics1_430x287-1200x628.jpg"}
