He came from a good family, he was smart, educated, had good values and had other avenues available to him to earn a living. He chose to box, knowing the inherent risks that every fighter faces when he or she walks into a boxing ring. Boxing is what Pat loved to do.\n\n\u2018It becomes very difficult to explain away or justify the dangers of boxing at a time like this. This is not a time where edicts or pronouncements are appropriate, or the answers are readily available.\n\n\u2018It is, however, a time for a call to action. While we don\u2019t have the answers, we certainly know many of the questions, have the means to answer them, and have the opportunity to respond responsibly and accordingly and make boxing safer for all who participate.\n\n\u2018This is a way we can honour the legacy of Pat Day.\u2019\n\nOn Tuesday, Conwell penned an emotional letter to Day in which he admitted he \u2018thought about quitting boxing\u2019 in the days following the fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I never meant this to happen to you, all I wanted to do was win,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018If I could take it all back, I would. No-one deserves this to happen to them.\n\n\u2018I replay the fight over and over in my head thinking what if this never happened and why did it happen to you.\n\nConwell admitted he considered quitting the sport following the fight (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t stop thinking about it myself. I prayed for you so many times and shed so many tears because I couldn\u2019t even imagine how my family and friends would feel.\n\n\u2018I see you everywhere you go and all I hear is wonderful things about you. I thought about quitting boxing but I know that\u2019s not what you would want.\n\n\u2018I know that you were a fighter at heart so I decided not to, and to fight and win a world title because that\u2019s what you wanted and that\u2019s what I want, so I will use you as motivation every day and make sure I leave it all in the ring every time.\u2019\n\nMORE: Rhian Brewster reveals why Jurgen Klopp blocked a loan move away from Liverpool in the summer", "description": "Patrick Day has died at the age of 27, four days after suffering a head injury during his super welterweight bout with compatriot Charles Conwell.
