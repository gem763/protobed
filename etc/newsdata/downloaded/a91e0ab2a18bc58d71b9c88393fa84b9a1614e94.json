Fallon/Bloomberg Fast-food workers are trying to organize at franchises over wages as well as poor working conditions, such as protection against sexual harassment, but a new bill could stymie their efforts.\n\nWork stinks for too many Americans laboring in the fast-food industry: wage theft is rampant, women confront sexual harassment in the industry, and when workers protest poor work conditions, they often report being fired or otherwise retaliated against.\n\nUnfortunately, fast-food workers will have an even tougher time holding corporate giants that control workplace standards in the industry accountable if a bipartisan group of senators have their way.\n\nFor more than 80 years, existing federal workplace laws have helped ensure that corporations that control workplace standards cannot escape accountability for their own violations by relying on smaller companies \u2014 including franchisees \u2014 to supply their labor force.\n\nThese joint-employment protections recognize that a corporation may relinquish the official title of employer, but not control over their labor suppliers\u2019 basic business decisions or workplace conditions.\n\nLets corporations off the hook\n\nHowever, the innocuously named Trademark Licensing Protection Act would significantly weaken these joint-employer protections in franchise establishments \u2014 letting large corporations off the hook when they infringe on workers\u2019 rights guaranteed under federal minimum wage, child labor and collective bargaining laws.\n\nAs a result, smaller franchises would be solely liable for any workplace misdeeds and workers would be left unprotected.\n\nHistorically, franchising represented an arm\u2019s length contracting agreement. But today, many industry giants control almost every aspect of a fast-food franchisee\u2019s business. Operations manuals dictating the behavior of individual franchise restaurants stretch hundreds of pages--prescribing workers\u2019 training and appearance requirements, approved suppliers, participation in advertising promotions, and required computer systems.\n\nCorporate franchisors can also monitor franchise compliance through their computerized bookkeeping and scheduling systems, as well as corporate business consultants, specifically hired to monitor restaurant owners. Sometimes franchisors even act as landlord \u2014 with one report finding that this can allow the corporations to jack up property rent over industry averages.\n\nCheated out of their wages\n\nOf course, it is important for franchisors to control brand quality, but corporations may also use franchise contracts and ongoing interactions to indirectly control restaurant workers, which can result in fast-food workers being cheated out of wages and deprived of their rights.\n\nAccording to New York University\u2019s Andrew Elmdore, \u201cSince franchisors aggressively police nearly all cost variables, suppressing employee wages is one of the few ways that franchisees can boost store profit by cutting costs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a review conducted by Bloomberg found at least one violation of the federal wage standard law in three-quarters of all investigations of fast-food restaurants conducted by the Department of Labor during the Obama administration. All totaled, these 4,000 investigations resulted in the recovery of $14 million in back wages for 57,000 workers.\n\nUnfortunately, this lawlessness doesn\u2019t just extend to wage protections.\n\nSexual harassment\n\nLast year, fast food workers in 10 cities participated in a day-long #MeToo strike to protest sexual harassment that they say has long gone unchecked. Over the past several years fast-food workers have filed multiple complaints about being threatened, retaliated against, and even fired for asserting their rights to come together with their co-workers to protest for higher pay, better work conditions and a union.\n\nIn order to uphold higher standards, the Obama administration adopted reforms to improve oversight of corporations that violated federal wage and collective-bargaining protections. These reforms not only helped ensure that joint-employer protections were being enforced, but also encouraged corporations to take their role in encouraging compliance seriously.\n\nFor example, in July 2016, the restaurant chain Subway entered into a voluntary agreement with the DOL to improve minimum-wage compliance across its 27,000 franchises. In the three years prior, the DOL had required Subway franchises to pay more than $2 million in back wages for 6,000 workers.\n\nStrong job growth\n\nWhile lobbyists claimed that the Obama-era reforms would harm industry growth, the industry continued to expand in the years following their adoption. Indeed, employment growth in the industry outpaced overall private-sector employment growth.\n\nYet the Trademark Licensing Protection Act is part of a much larger effort by corporate lobbyists, emboldened by the Trump administration, to all but do away with joint-employer protections.\n\nTrump appointees at the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board are pursuing rule makings that significantly weaken the ability of workers across all industries to hold large corporations accountable for workplace violations. Similar measures are being adopted at the state level.\n\nLobbyists claim that the Trademark Protection Act will simply clarify corporate franchisors\u2019 responsibilities under the law, but pro-worker policy makers should not be fooled \u2014 the bill is just the latest attempt to roll back American workers\u2019 rights on the job.", "description": "Fast-food workers will have an even tougher time holding corporate giants that control workplace standards in the industry accountable if a bipartisan group...", "authors": ["Karla Walter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR278_mcdona_ZG_20190913115449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
