According to Somers, the couple \u2014 who married in 1977 \u2014 make love twice a day thanks to the \u201csexual stimulant.\u201d\n\nView photos Suzanne Somers says she and husband Alan Hamel (pictured in 2016) make their sex life a priority.

But, you know, then again around 8 o'clock in the morning, I'm in the mood.\u201d\n\nView photos Somers swears by shots of PT-141 to give her a boost in the bedroom.

She now claims that adding PT-141 shots \u2014 typically used to treat low sexual desire in cases without an underlying medical or emotional cause \u2014 has helped her get \u201cin the mood.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of in that groove, like when you were younger and you're in the mood all the time, and so is he because he's on hormone replacements,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, what a great thing.\u2019 Because men have had Viagra, but this [is] actually a shot for both men and women that\u2019s not a drug. It just stimulates that part of your brain that says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m kind of in the mood.\u2019 And so, isn\u2019t that a wonderful thing? And it\u2019s not a drug, so I love it.\u201d\n\nSherry A. Ross, MD, a women\u2019s health expert and the author of She-ology, thinks Somers is setting a good example by speaking out about her sex life \u2014 but cautions that not everyone may enjoy the same effects from the medication.\n\n\u201cI have to give Suzanne Somers credit for embracing sex and standing on a soap box to talk about it,\u201d Ross tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWith the sexual injustice happening in the bedroom, women have not been given many viable options to help improve desire. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) affects over 40 percent of women with very few treatment options. Unlike men, women\u2019s sexual desire, excitement and energy tend to begin in that great organ above the shoulders, rather than the one below the waist. The daily stresses of work, money, children, relationships and diminished energy are common issues contributing to low libido in women. It\u2019s not a myth, after all, that women are more complicated than men.\u201d", "description": "The \"Three's Company\" star and her 83-year-old husband credit their sex life to weekly shots of a \"sexual stimulant.\"", "authors": ["Erin Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G25RIqoKMAjMYLocWfcqGQ--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a6e200a0-f9a5-11e9-a7ff-213c00433f58", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
