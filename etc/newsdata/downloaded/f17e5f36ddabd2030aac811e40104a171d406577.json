The popular pussycat is currently on a press tour in New York, which is just the latest of many business endeavors.\n\nThe kitty holds the Guinness World Record for cat with the most followers. She also has her own line of branded pet food and has appeared on the big screen, guest-starring in \"Nine Lives\" with Kevin Spacey.\n\nIn fact, her owners Shannon Ellis and Pookie Methachittiphan have turned photos of their feline into a full-fledged career.\n\n\"When we first started on this journey we had no idea that this would be something we\u2019d be able to turn into a business,\" said Methachittiphan. \"The main goal was to share Nala\u2019s photos with family and friends, but the response from the facebook and Instagram community was overwhelming in the best way.\"\n\nBuying a car for your teenager? Here's what you should keep in mind\n\nCheck your bank account! Former MoviePass users say discontinued service is still charging them\n\nNala is much more cheerful than the late Grumpy Cat, and she doesn't benefit from having super famous owners like many viral pets out there. Nala's social media spotlight was organic, according to her owners who are now very strategic about building the cat's following.\n\nThe owners comment on other pages and engage with their followers to build Nala's brand.\n\n\"If you want love, you have to give love. Commenting on other accounts will bring more awareness to your own account,\" Pookie said. However, the owners don't advise flooding your follower's timelines with content.\n\n\"Be consistent with your posting so your audience has something to look forward to. Don\u2019t post too often. If you post more than one in-feed post during a 24-hour span, the two pieces of content will compete with each other via the algorithm.\"\n\n#ShowtheBow (Photo: Hand-out, Love, Nala)\n\nNala's owners also said it's important to brainstorm personality traits and unique identifiers for your pet before posting online.\n\n\"Nala, for example, is all about love, happiness, boxes and toilet paper,\" Methachittiphan said. The cat has also been approached to produce branded content and endorse merchandise.\n\nThe four-legged phenomenon was adopted by Methachittiphan at 5 months old in 2010. Ellis, whose side hustle included creating bowties for animals, came into the picture a few months later after seeing the kitten rise to fame on Instagram.\n\nEllis and Methachittiphan met months later, fell in love and eventually quit their jobs to help launch Nala into stardom.\n\nNala Cat is now using her platform to spread awareness about pet rescue initiatives to her fans and beyond.\n\n\"Adoption is really important to our family. It\u2019s giving a life an opportunity to thrive,\" said Ellis. \"A simple act of kindness filled our lives with so much love and abundance. It's one of the best ways to honor Nala.\"\n\nOn Oct. 29, the Nala's owners are kickstarting an initiative that could help your adopted pet gain exposure online.\n\nThe owners are asking people who adopt a cat on National Cat Day to place a bowtie on their pet and post photos on Instagram using the hashtag #ShowtheBow. They will share the photos on Nala's profile in order to drive a movement called \"adopt don't shop,\" Ellis said.\n\n\"Stay true to your brand, values and ethics. Know your pets\u2019 limits because they ultimately call the shots,\" Methachittiphan said. \"And remember that you work for them \u2013 Nala is our boss.\"\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin Brown.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/29/how-to-turn-pet-photos-into-full-time-business/4083462002/", "description": "Nala Cat, a viral sensation with more than 4 million followers, is using her platform to spread awareness\u00a0about pet rescue initiatives.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Published A.M.
