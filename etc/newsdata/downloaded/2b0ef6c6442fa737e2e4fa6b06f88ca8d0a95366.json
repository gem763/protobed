The game\u2019s free and paid add-ons are complete. Its store has been filled with extra gear to buy. Today, Ubisoft confirmed that October\u2019s update will be the game\u2019s last.\n\nThe game\u2019s October update will include the addition to the in-game store of a horse called Melaina, named \u201cafter the playful nymph,\u201d Ubisoft\u2019s house blogger explained in a post today. The horse will be added along with a 1.5.1 patch that primarily focused on bug fixes.\n\nThe game\u2019s anniversary is also being recognised with a daily roll-out of epic mercenary and epic ship encounters starting now and running into early November. These encounters had been trickled out throughout the game\u2019s first year and are being re-offered with extra rewards as the game winds down.\n\nAfter that?\n\nWell, there is no new Assassin\u2019s Creed this year, there is most assuredly one coming out next year (Vikings, right?), but there\u2019s also the fact that Ubisoft seems to really like updating its franchise games one last time to tease a sequel. In July of 2018, Ubisoft began seeding The Division with quests that would unlock content in March 2019's The Division 2.\n\nIn June of this year, 2017's Ghost Recon Wildlands got a surprise bonus questline that turned out to be a teaser for October\u2019s Breakpoint sequel. Ever see Ubisoft only do a thing twice? Me neither. Here\u2019s to Odyssey getting one more final update at some expected date to tease the next AC.", "description": "It\u2019s been clear for a while that Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey is just about done in terms of game updates.
