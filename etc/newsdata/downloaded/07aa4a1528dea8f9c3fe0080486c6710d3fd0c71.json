But those first Fridays were lonely affairs. She stationed herself outside Swedish parliament with her handwritten sign and, sometimes, a few friends.\n\nFifteen year old Swedish student Greta Thunberg leads a school strike and sits outside of Riksdagen, the Swedish parliament building, in order to raises awareness for climate change on August 28, 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden.

And so fast, only in 15 months,\" Thunberg told the AP. \"I can't wait to see the official numbers come in. It will be magnificent.\"\n\nThunberg will make her voice heard again on Saturday at the United Nations Youth Climate Summit in New York City, then speak at the UN Climate Action Summit on Monday.

Other estimates were as high as 250,000 people.\n\n\"We have only been born into this world, we are going to have to live with this crisis our whole lives. So will our children and grandchildren and coming generations,\" Thunberg told Reuters. \"We are not going to accept this. We are striking because we want a future and we are going to carry on.\"\n\nDavid Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\"I think if enough people get together and stand up for this then that can have a huge difference, to put pressure on the people in power, to actually hold them accountable and to say you need to do something now,\" Thunberg said.", "description": "One year and one month ago, Greta Thunberg began her lonely climate change demonstrations at Swedish parliament.
