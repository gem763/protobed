Josh Jacobs\u2019 diving touchdown with less than two minutes to play gave the silver and black a win that looked to have slipped through their fingers after a dominant first half.\n\nThe late drama was fitting of a brilliant, chaotic first day of NFL action at the new Tottenham stadium, and capped one of the best games of American Football this country has seen in its still youthful love affair with the sport.\n\nThe crowd was raucous - deafening at times - and more partisan than London has been used to. Raiders and Bears jerseys outnumbered those of the other 30 teams - an ever present fixture at the UK games. The roar when Oakland cornerback Gareon Conley picked off Chase Daniel, as the Bears quarterback looked to rescue the game, could have come from any home crowd at any NFL stadium stateside.\n\nThe ferocious Bears defense came out looking jet lagged and never found their feet in the first half. Oakland ran all over them, with Josh Jacobs (26 carries for 123 yards and two scores) and DeAndre Washington both effective chewing yards up and middle and converting on third down. Derek Carr (25 of 32, 229 yards) had eons of time whenever he dropped back in the pocket and consistently found receivers open.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t have been further from Chicago\u2019s throttling performance against the Vikings last Sunday.", "description": "The Raiders might just be regretting their planned move to Las Vegas when they look so at home in London.", "authors": ["Alex Finnis", "Alan Tyers", "Match Report", "Live Blog", "James Corrigan", "Daniel Schofield", "Ben Coles"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/american-football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212245201-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqHqEqWIQYN_HlsJ_HcWHEJDlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
