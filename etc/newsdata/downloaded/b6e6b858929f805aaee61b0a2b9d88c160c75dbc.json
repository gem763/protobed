(NYSE:OI) Is Yielding 2.0% - But Is It A Buy?", "language": "en", "text": "Dividend paying stocks like Owens-Illinois, Inc. (NYSE:OI) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nSome readers mightn't know much about Owens-Illinois's 2.0% dividend, as it has only been paying distributions for a year or so. The company also returned around 6.6% of its market capitalisation to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks over the past year. Remember that the recent share price drop will make Owens-Illinois's yield look higher, even though recent events might have impacted the company's prospects. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Owens-Illinois!\n\nNYSE:OI Historical Dividend Yield, October 21st 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Owens-Illinois paid out 17% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. Given the low payout ratio, it is hard to envision the dividend coming under threat, barring a catastrophe.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Last year, Owens-Illinois paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable.\n\nIs Owens-Illinois's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Owens-Illinois has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 5.62 times its EBITDA, Owens-Illinois could be described as a highly leveraged company. While some companies can handle this level of leverage, we'd be concerned about the dividend sustainability if there was any risk of an earnings downturn.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 2.45 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Owens-Illinois, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well. High debt and weak interest cover are not a great combo, and we would be cautious of relying on this company's dividend while these metrics persist.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Owens-Illinois's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Owens-Illinois, Inc.
