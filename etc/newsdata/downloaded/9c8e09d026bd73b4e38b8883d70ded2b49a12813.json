Analysts are already expecting the company to beat results, and early revenue numbers are positive. Coke has beat estimates for countless quarters at this point. So we had to ask: how? Is it the new products that Coke reveals? Is it cost controls? The answer lies somewhere in between.\n\nCoke Employee Count, Stock Price\n\nThere has never been a better time to be a Coca-Cola (NYSE: ) investor, or an employee, according to our data. The stock is at an all-time high (for the past few decades, at least) and the company has never employed more people in recent memory. Things are up, seeing a 5% increase in staff count from this time last year, and a 60% increase over the last four years.\n\nBut here is where we start to point out the potential downfalls for the company. It's all based on its own expectations, how well Pepsi (NASDAQ: ) is doing in comparison, soda taxes, the recent health trend to kick out sugary soft drinks, and the following data.\n\nCoca-Cola Job Listings\n\nHiring is down, but that might also explain why it keeps beating estimates. While Coke puts its new products like Coke Energy forward as a reason investors are excited about the brand\u2019s prospects, data shows that the company has been busy getting lean when it comes to human capital. Revenue is expected to be up because it's spending less. Reduce the human capital overhead and boom, there's your answer.\n\nCoca Cola New Job Openings, QoQ\n\nIn fact, when looking at new openings quarter-over-quarter, openings are down precipitously.\n\nDespite its history as an American brand, Coca-Cola (NYSE: ) is moving jobs overseas. In recent months, there has been an uptick in hirings in China, Bulgaria, France, Japan, Mexico and more.\n\nCoca-Cola Hiring By Country\n\nAbout The Data\n\nThinknum tracks companies using information they post online - jobs, social and web traffic, product sales and app ratings - and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Thinknum covering: Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo Inc.
