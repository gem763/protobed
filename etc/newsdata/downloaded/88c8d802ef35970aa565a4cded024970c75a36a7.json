By Monday night, the blaze had scorched 74,000 acres, destroyed more than 100 homes, businesses and other buildings, and sent smoke hovering across the Bay Area.\n\nAnd in Southern California, more than 1,000 firefighters were fighting flames that erupted overnight, temporarily shutting down a major interstate in northern Los Angeles County and threatening more than 10,000 buildings.\n\n\"This, unfortunately, is now California's normal,\" said Scott McLean of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nHand crews work a wildfire-damaged hillside as the Getty fire burns on Mandeville Canyon, Oct. 28, 2019, in Los Angeles. Marcio Jose Sanchez\n\nSixteen significant blazes are burning across the state, McLean said. Firefighters are responding to an average of 170 fires a week, with many of them smaller than 10 acres, he said.\n\nThere was a sliver of good news: No deaths have been reported, though at least two firefighters have been injured. During a lull in the wind on Monday, firefighters gained ground on the Kinkade fire, containing 15 percent of it with a fire line, up from 5 percent earlier in the day.\n\nAt an evacuation center in Napa County, Francisco Alvarado, 15, told NBC Bay Area that this was the second time in as many years that he'd had to flee his home. Two years ago, the Tubbs fire roared across the region, killing 22 people and devastating neighborhoods in the city of Santa Rosa.\n\n\"I'm pretty mad that we have to keep evacuating,\" he said. \"I just want to be home.\"\n\nAmong those forced to evacuate: Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James. He sought safety with his family overnight.\n\n\"Man these LA (fires) aren't no joke,\" James tweeted at 3:53 a.m. \"Had to emergency evacuate my house and I've been driving around with my family trying to get rooms. No luck so far!\"\n\nAs residents waited to have their power turned restored \u2014 or anticipated the next blackout \u2014 Gov. Gavon Newsom slammed PG&E for its preventative shutdowns, saying he wanted to see a \"total reform\" of the so-called public safety shutoffs.\n\n\"Utilities must be held accountable and be aggressively penalized for their overreliance\" on the shutoffs, he said in a statement.\n\nNews\n\nThe utility, which provides power across much of Northern California, has used rolling blackouts in fire-prone areas where downed lines and faulty transmission towers have been known to spark wildfires, including last year's Camp fire.The state's deadliest, 85 people were killed in the blaze.\n\nNewsom has argued that greed and mismanagement led to the maintenance issues that require the utility to use blackouts during wildfire weather.\n\nDuring a news conference Monday, utility CEO Andy Vise defended the blackouts, saying they prevent \"catastrophic events from happening.\"\n\n\"We continue to believe it's the right thing to do,\" he said. \"We will not roll the dice when it comes to public safety.\"", "description": "Firefighters across the state were racing to battle blazes ignited by an earlier round of powerful winds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4266450/1000x563_nbc-191028-getty-fire-se-642p_63e2896466462e1d7a3379eb35f97312.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
