It would let public-sector workers keep their full Social Security benefits and increase benefits for people who spend at least 80 hours a month as unpaid caregivers for young children, the elderly or the disabled.\n\nThe biggest part of the plan, however, is an across-the-board increase in monthly Social Security payments. Every current and future beneficiary will receive at least $200 more per month than under the current plan, and many low-income workers will receive at least $600 more.\n\n\u201cA generation of stagnant wages and rising costs for basics like housing, health care, education, and child care have squeezed family budgets,\u201d Warren writes in a Medium post. \u201cMillions of families have had to sacrifice saving for retirement just to make ends meet. At the same time, fewer people have access to the kind of pensions that used to help fund a comfortable retirement.\u201d Her campaign also released an outside analysis, by Moody\u2019s Analytics, which found that the plan would cut the elderly poverty rate by about two-thirds.\n\nShe would pay for the plan by increasing the payroll tax on incomes above $250,000, which are now shielded from it. As income inequality has soared in recent decades, Warren notes, the amount of the country\u2019s total income subject to the payroll tax, which finances Social Security, has declined. She would reverse that decline.\n\nI\u2019ve criticized Warren and other Democrats recently for backing a couple of policies that I think are wrongheaded and unpopular (like forcing everyone to enroll in Medicare). The Social Security plan is different. I\u2019ll want to read what others have to say about it in coming days, especially about the size of the increase, but my initial view is that this proposal is the opposite of mandatory Medicare \u2014 substantively smart and politically popular.", "description": "The elderly have also suffered from extreme inequality.", "authors": ["David Leonhardt"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/opinion/12leonhardt-newsletter/12leonhardt-newsletter-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
