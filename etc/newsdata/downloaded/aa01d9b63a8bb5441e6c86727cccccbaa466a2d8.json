Mr Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, is Mr Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nAll the other defendants in the case were already in custody.\n\nProsecutors said Mr Correia, who owns a home with his wife in West Palm Beach, was part of efforts by co-defendants Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to leverage outsized political donations to Republican candidates and committees as part of an effort to advance their business interests.\n\nBoth Mr Parnas and Mr Fruman have a history of business dealings with Mr Giuliani. Prosecutors said that, among other things, the pair made campaign contributions with the intent of lobbying US politicians to oust the country's ambassador to Ukraine. At the time, Mr Giuliani was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Mr Trump's potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.", "description": "David Correia, 44, was named in an indictment with three other men on charges they made illegal contributions to politicians and a committee supporting President Donald Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3531%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_22/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5723da84432eca8ef88e5daf92956de081db07e8", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
