We will not stop no matter what anyone says,\" he said in a speech on Friday.\n\nTurkey insists it is targeting \"terrorist positions\" and shows the \"utmost caution\" to avoid targeting civilians and infrastructure during its operation.\n\n'Outgunned and outnumbered'\n\nTurkey's air and ground operation into Syria came after Donald Trump, the president of the United States, pulled his country's troops from their positions near the border, leaving the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) vulnerable to a Turkish assault.\n\nThe SDF was Washington's main ally in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS), but Ankara considers the Kurdish-led forces a \"terrorist\" group.\n\nReporting from the Turkish border town of Akcakale, Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr said Turkish and Kurdish-led forces continued waging fierce battles for control of Tal Abyad on Friday.\n\n\"The Turkish military is using heavy firepower - air strikes, artillery shelling, as well as rocket fire. The town of Tal Abyad is empty [of civilians],\" she said. \"The SDF is outgunned and outnumbered, but they have promised to put up a difficult fight, and have been firing rockets into Turkish border towns.\"\n\nTurkish fighter jets and artillery also struck around Syria's Ras al-Ain, the other border town that has been the focus of the Turkish offensive.\n\nPeople gather at the site of an explosion in the northeastern Syrian Kurdish city of Qamishli on October 11, 2019 [Mohammed Ahmad/ AFP]\n\nThe Anadolu agency said 10 civilians were killed from SDF's mortar attacks on the Turkish side on Friday - eight in the town of Nusaybin and two in the town of Suruc. The state-run agency, citing officials, said Turkish forces and its allied Syrian opposition forces advanced 8km (five miles) into Syrian territory and captured 14 villages from the SDF.\n\nSeparately, car bombs exploded outside a restaurant in the Kurdish-controlled urban centre of Qamishli, killing at least three people, in an attack claimed by ISIL.\n\nThe SDF, which has long warned that a Turkish offensive in the region could revive ISIL, also said five suspected fighters from the armed group had escaped from a prison in Qamishli because of Turkish shelling nearby.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the Kurdish-led force said it quelled a riot at the al-Hawl camp, where an estimated 70,000 people, most of them relatives of the suspected ISIL fighters, were being detained.\n\nMeanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump was planning to activate \"very powerful\" sanctions on Ankara.\n\n\"We hope we don't have to use them but we can shut down the Turkish economy if we need to,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nMark Esper, the US defence secretary, meanwhile called on Turkey to halt the Syria offensive, saying it has threatened the progress in combating ISIL and risked harm to US troops there.\n\nA Pentagon statement on Friday said Esper called his Turkish counterpart and \"strongly encouraged Turkey to discontinue actions in northeastern Syria\" so that the world community \"could find a common way to de-escalate the situation before it becomes irreparable\".\n\nCalls for restraint and de-escalation also came from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and European Union Council chief Donald Tusk, who expressed \"grave concern\" about the Turkish operation.\n\nAmelie de Montchalin, the French secretary for European affairs, said sanctions against Turkey will be \"on the table\" at next week's European Union summit, telling France Inter radio that Europe should respond to what she called a shocking situation.", "description": "Ankara pledges to continue operation in northeast Syria despite warnings over humanitarian crisis as 100,000 flee homes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/44c1f837dd3b47c18beaeeb3b7adcdf9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
