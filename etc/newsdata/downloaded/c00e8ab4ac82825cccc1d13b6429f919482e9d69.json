Since hitting a low for this decade of 15 million viewers in 2017, viewership has climbed 9 percent and is on par with the 2016 season (16.5 million),\u201d THR reports.\n\nSo, what gives?\n\nReasons for the turnaround abound: Legalized gambling, growth in fantasy sports, and more scoring, all factor in to some degree.\n\nHowever, given that the NFL\u2019s ratings crash happened to coincide with the advent of Colin Kaepernick\u2019s anthem protest movement, it would be absurd to not ask what impact the almost complete disappearance of the protest movement has had on league ratings.\n\nFox Sports Executive Vice President and Head of Strategy and Analytics Michal Mulvihill, suggests the absence of the protests, has had an impact.\n\n\u201cIf the conversation around football is primarily about the game, then we\u2019re probably winning,\u201d Mulvihill explained. \u201cAnd if the conversation is about topics away from the game, we\u2019re probably losing. I think the focus for the past season and a half has become more where we\u2019d like it to be, which is just on the games.\u201d\n\nOf course, there was no topic \u201caway from the game\u201d in 2016 and 2017, that dominated the headlines more than Colin Kaepernick\u2019s anthem protests.\n\nMichael Nathanson, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson, sees the NFL returning to its traditional role as an escape from politics, as being a factor in the improved ratings.\n\n\u201cI also think we as Americans want an escape from all the political back-and-forth,\u201d Nathanson said. \u201cYou have a bit of escapism, you have higher scoring, you have some younger players, perhaps you have some gambling influence. It\u2019s all kind of working together.\u201d\n\nSeems like \u201csticking to sports\u201d is the way to go.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "In the midst of the steep NFL ratings drop of 2016-2017, the majority of the sports media was insistent that the decline had nothing to do", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo-Ted-S.-Warren-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
