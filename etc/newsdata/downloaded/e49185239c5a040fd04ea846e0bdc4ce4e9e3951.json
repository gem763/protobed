The property information provider forecasts annual price growth of 5.4% by July 2020 despite major housing markets experiencing declines across the U.S. in much of 2019.\n\n\u201cWith the for-sale inventory remaining low in many markets, the pick-up in buying has nudged price growth up,\" said Frank Nothaft, chief economist at CoreLogic. \"If low interest rates and rising income continue, then we expect home-price growth will strengthen over the coming year.\u201d\n\nAfter Hurricane Dorian: Your house has flooded. Here's what you should do next.\n\nHow to buy a home millennial style: Be frugal.\n\nThe optimistic housing market outlook comes on the heels of an August index report by the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller which showed home prices rising at the slowest pace since 2012. The composite home price index also said that June prices fell in New York and Miami as Seattle experienced year over year drops, according to MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cAlthough the rise in home prices has slowed over the past several months, we see a reacceleration over the next year to just over 5% on an annualized basis,\u201d said Frank Martell, president and CEO of CoreLogic. \u201cLower rates are certainly making it more affordable to buy homes and millennial buyers are entering the market with increasing force.\"\n\nMillennials have been driving home sales the past few years, and the young adults are doing so thoughtfully.\n\nAbout 76% of young adult recent homebuyers spent less than 30% of their monthly income on housing costs in 2017, the latest data available show. That number was up from 69% in 2000 and 65% in 2009, according to Census data.\n\nAnd older millennials specifically are \"starting to express a desire to buy in a very tight housing market,\" according to CoreLogic. At the end of July, the inventory of homes for sale was down nearly 2% over a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Home prices set to jump 5.4% thanks to older millennials, report says", "description": "Every state except Connecticut and South Dakota saw home prices increase annually in 2019, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png"}
