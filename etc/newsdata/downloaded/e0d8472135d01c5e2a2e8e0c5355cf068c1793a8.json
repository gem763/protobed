We have our own culture as well but we are not in Samoa now,\" team manager Va'elua Aloi Alesana told the World Cup website here\n\n\u201cThere are some training venues that have allowed us to show our tattoos and some places where we can\u2019t, and for those places, we\u2019ve been given \u2018skins\u2019 to wear to cover our tattoos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe extra skins are only for when we go to the (swimming) pools though.
