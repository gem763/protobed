But the flip side of this argument \u2013 that social media is driving a positivity movement \u2013 is rarely talked about.\n\nHow many times have you said \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d, when in reality, nothing could be further from the truth? Sometimes it\u2019s just easier to say nothing\u2019s wrong because you\u2019re not ready for someone else to try to \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nThat\u2019s where social media comes in.\n\nIs your mental health suffering? It might be compassion fatigue\n\nThink about the number of Instagram accounts that promote positivity and mental well-being, or even the number of memes that gently satirise therapy sessions.\n\nIt takes very little effort to like an IG post that talks about feeling down or offers words of encouragement. Interacting, and seeing others interact, with posts like this can make users feel as if they aren\u2019t alone \u2013 and that in itself can make a big difference to people struggling with low self-esteem or mental illness.\n\n\u201cYoung people can benefit from the insight that there are others out there exactly like them,\u201d Dr Michael Eason, a psychologist and counsellor with the Hong Kong-based psychology practice MindnLife, says. \u201cThe \u2018I\u2019m not alone\u2019 discovery can be a light-bulb moment that saves many lives. This is especially true for people who live in rural communities or who are part of a minority, such as at-risk LGBTQ+ youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHearing stories about how someone else has gone through something similar to you is known to be helpful in reducing the stigma and feelings of shame around mental health,\u201d adds Dr Hannah Reidy, psychologist and CEO of mental health charity Mind HK. This stigma, along with other factors like a lack of resources or high costs, often prevent young people in Hong Kong from seeking help. Online platforms help to remove some of these psychological and physical barriers.\n\n\u201cHelp and support groups have always been a tool for recovery from physical and mental conditions,\u201d says Dr Tony Wong of The London Medical Clinic, in Hong Kong. \u201cSocial media allows better access for young people by removing geographical boundaries.\u201d In some cases, he adds, its relative anonymity can also reduce the stigma of seeking help.\n\nHowever, PhD psychology student Natalie Wong from Chinese University warns there are drawbacks to using social media as a form of treatment. \u201cPeople can actively create and disseminate information that matches their taste,\u201d she says. \u201c[Social media] can turn an open platform for interaction into an environment that reinstates one\u2019s beliefs or bias \u2026 which can be bad for our psychosocial well-being.\u201d\n\nOpen dialogue about mental health issues is essential and important\n\nIt can also make young people feel more lonely, says Reidy, if, for example, they \u201cfeel left out of certain social media groups or events, or if a young person feels that they don\u2019t fit the mould, or the way that other people are discussing a certain topic.\u201d\n\nBesides platforms like IG and Tumblr, apps such as 7 Cups and BetterHelp provide online therapy and support, where users can reach out to professional counsellors. While Eason and Wong agree that seeking any help is better than not seeking help at all, these apps shouldn\u2019t be the only qualified help someone seeks. \u201cAs amazing as technology can be, there is simply no replacing the therapeutic power of face-to-face human interaction,\u201d says Eason.\n\nThere are other drawbacks to solely relying on apps to improve your mental health. Apps that link to text or Skype counselling, Reidy says, should always be vetted to make sure the person you\u2019re speaking to is qualified to help you.\n\nHow to take care of your mental health during the Hong Kong extradition bill protests\n\nWong agrees. \u201cWith so much choice out there, it may be hard to determine if [the app] has been vetted by professionals, and if the advice is sound. Interactions online with professionals can lack the intimacy of a real-life consultation and conversation,\u201d he says. Sometimes, he adds, simply making the effort to leave home to attend a face-to-face session can be helpful.\n\nThe trick, Eason says, is to find the balance between social media and social reality. \u201cAs with many things in life, there are both pros and cons to modern social media use. Some of the mental benefits include an increased sense of social connection, positive self-esteem, and identity formation,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the other hand, negative mental impacts may arise from bullying, rejection, or the fear of missing out.\u201d\n\nWhen used sensibly, social media can be a great medium for people who feel unable to reach out to those around them. \u201cA big part of growing up is learning who you are, and this can sometimes feel quite isolating for young people,\u201d Reidy says. \u201cSocial media\u2019s ability to connect people through shared interests or traits can definitely bring people together and help with isolation.\u201d\n\nHere are some inspirational or mental health IG accounts that you might want to follow:\n\nselfcareisforeveryone, positivelypresent, anxiety_wellbeing, myselflovesupply, emotions_therapy, advocatingmentalillnesses, revelatori, and iweigh\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental illness or suicidal thoughts, there are many resources available to help you:\n\nThe Samaritans: 2896 0000\n\nThe Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong offers online support at help4suicide.com.hk and a 24 hour hotline: 2389 2222\n\nSuicide Prevention Service: 2382 0000\n\nHKFYG Counselling Service: 2777 8899\n\nHKFYG uTouch Portal has an online chat forum from 2pm to midnight (Monday to Saturday) at utouch.hk", "description": "We all know about the downsides of platforms like Instagram and Facebook, but experts say they can also bring positivity into your life.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shutterstock_1082692274.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
