So far we have seen evidence of that.\n\n\u201cI judge the atmosphere by the volume at breakfast and in the changeroom, and I walked into a party this morning. The beat-box was going and the guys were smiling, so for me that is a massive confidence boost.\u201d\n\nPrior to this World Cup, Canada had not met the All Blacks in eight years and had not played South Africa since 2000, which reveals their lack of opportunities to test themselves against the game\u2019s elite.\n\n\u201cWhat this group of players do is learn and get better every week. There is a huge amount of growth potential,\u201d said Jones.\n\n\u201cWe took lessons from the All Blacks, there are lots of things they do well and we try to take that into our game.\u201d\n\nJones knows exactly what kind of threat the Springboks will pose in Kobe. The last of his 10 caps for Wales came when he captained the side in Pretoria in 1998, a match which South Africa won 96-13, still the team\u2019s biggest ever defeat.\n\nHowever, it is one thing to know what is coming and another to be able to counter it.\n\n\u201cWe know South African rugby, whether it is Super Rugby or the national team. We know what we are going to get tomorrow,\u201d added Jones.\n\n\u201cThey squeeze you up front and then it comes down to the gain-line. They can take the ball quickly through the phases and they also have some very good players in the backline.\n\n\u201cBut that is the challenge for us and we will meet that challenge.\u201d", "description": "If Canada's players are feeling nervous ahead of Tuesday's Rugby World Cup game against twice champions South Africa they are not showing it, with coach Kingsley Jones saying the squad is in party mood ahead of the Pool B clash in Kobe.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437999008&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960GS", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
