Here's what we know about them.\n\n</div>\n\nIn response to the attack, the international oil price jumped by close to 20% on Monday morning.\n\n\n\nHugo Pienaar, chief economist at the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University, said the oil price jump will wipe out the petrol price decline set for South Africa.\n\nThe latest data from the Central Energy Fund (CEF) showed that the South African petrol price - set once a month - was expected to decline by almost 11c a litre due to a stronger Rand.\n\n\u201cIf the Rand remains strong, and if the oil price recovers in the days ahead, the 11c decline could compensate for a higher oil price, leaving the petrol price in October the same,\u201d Pienaar told Business Insider South Africa.\n\n\u201cBut if the Rand deteriorates or the oil price remains exorbitantly high, it can see local petrol prices increase.\u201d\n\nThe strength of the Rand heavily affects the South African petrol price as the country imports oil in US Dollars.\n\n\u201cIf the Rand continues to strengthen against the US dollar it may further reduce the impact on South African consumers.\u201d\n\nBloomberg reported that Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil company Aramco is aiming to restart a significant portion of the stalled oil production within days, but will require weeks to restore full output capacity.\n\nAlso read: The world's largest oil plant in Saudi Arabia was attacked by 10 explosive drones ahead of Aramco's plans for the biggest listing ever\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Automobile Association spokesperson Layton Beard said they believe the attack on Saudi oil refineries will have a negative impact on the petrol price.\n\nBeard, however, said it is still too early to make a prediction.\n\n\u201cThe latest data from CEF reflects what happened in the markets last week. We will have to see tomorrow what the impact of the attack had on South Africa\u2019s imports,\u201d Beard told Business Insider South Africa.\n\n\u201cBoth the oil price and the South African rand is extremely volatile so it is impossible to make a prediction on what will happen in the days and weeks ahead.\u201d", "description": "International oil price jumped by close to 20% on Monday morning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8107/d55b345d8cdc44329c316ad23415cb2a.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
