There is a group of communists who still have ideas to overthrow the monarchy, to turn Thailand to communism,\" Gen Apirat told an auditorium of military officers, policemen and uniformed students.\n\nThe monarchy is legally above reproach in Thailand, and the new constitutional monarch who was officially crowned in May, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, has taken several steps since the death of his father to increase his authority, including taking direct control of two key army units.\n\nMr Thanathorn, who has denied the military's accusations that he is anti-monarchy, said Gen Apirat's attempt to link him to the Hong Kong protests was the latest attempt to instigate hatred.\n\n\"We started the Future Forward Party with good intentions for the country,\" he said in a Facebook post.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the force pushing Thailand towards democracy, creating equality in society and leaving it a better one for the next generations.\"\n\nLast week, the military filed a sedition case against Mr Thanathorn and others, accusing them of stirring unrest with talk of amending the 2017 constitution written by allies of the military.\n\nIt followed a public seminar they held in the Muslim-majority south, in which the first article of the constitution - stating that Thailand is one indivisible kingdom - was discussed.\n\n\"They are being shrewd, talking of amending the first article without stating directly what they want, knowing this will affect other articles about the monarchy,\" Gen Apirat said.\n\n\"This article invoked the blood our ancestors had shed to keep this land. I can tell you I will never allow it, even to my dying day,\" Gen Apirat said.\n\nThe army chief cast the military as loyal to the nation and the royal family.\n\n\"Don't forget that Thailand is the only country in this region that has never been colonised, thanks to past kings,\" Gen Apirat said.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BANGKOK] Thailand's army chief lashed out at opposition figures on Friday in an emotional speech in which he portrayed politicians and academics as threats to national security and even the monarchy. .
