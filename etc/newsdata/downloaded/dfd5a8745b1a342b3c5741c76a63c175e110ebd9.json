I'm still trying not to be the daughter of an abused and murdered woman. I'm still trying to redeem them.'\n\nMoorer has long been hesitant to talk about the deaths of her parents in Frankville, Alabama, when she was just 14.\n\nThe murder-suicide in 1986 was something she and her older sister, Grammy-winning singer Shelby Lynne, avoided questions about their entire careers.\n\nBut now Blood, a memoir out on Tuesday with a companion album of the same name, is set to finally address the family's tragic, dark secrets.\n\nThe murder-suicide in 1986 was something country star Allison Moorer, pictured, and her sister, Grammy-winning singer Shelby Lynne, avoided questions about their entire careers\n\nMorroer's dad Franklin, second from left, shot and killed her mom Lynn, second from right, before turning the gun on himself when Allison, right, was just 14 and her sister, left, was 17\n\nAhead on @CBSThisMorning: @AllisonMoorer is finding a way to forgive.\n\n\n\nThe singer-songwriter shares how she\u2019s using music to move on from a family tragedy. pic.twitter.com/ia14rxBEw0 \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) October 29, 2019\n\n'Every editor, every journalist was told, \"Just don't ask her about it,'' Moorer said. 'Well, of course that was what they all wanted to know.'\n\n'I needed a larger form to tell the story,' Moorer said.\n\nMoorer, who earned a master's degree while writing the book, dug through family pictures, recordings, lyrics, letters and even autopsy notes that spurred what she called active remembering.\n\nCover image of 'Blood: A Memoir' by singer-songwriter Allison Moorer\n\nMoorer told CBS: 'I wanna know why so that I can come to terms and say, \"Okay, well, what I'm really trying to do is forgive\".\n\nWhen asked if she can forgive her dad Moorer replied: 'Yeah. I needed to do it so that I could be happy.'\n\nOne song on the album was written by her father, who wanted to be a songwriter and instilled in his daughters' their earliest musical lessons.\n\n'I'm the One to Blame' was written well before either Moorer or her sister was born and the lyrics were found inside his old briefcase.\n\n'He always wanted to write songs, always wanted to play music, always wanted to be a working musician and just never got there,' Moorer said. 'To be able to do that for him is really important.'\n\nDad Franklin was a teacher but also an alcoholic who left Moorer and Shelby Lynne feeling 'terror'.\n\nMoorer says she used to pray every night: 'Please, God, don't let daddy hurt mama.'\n\nWhen she fell off the family horse one day Moorer says her father 'hit my sister in the face for it', adding: 'When your daddy beats the c**p out of you, how are you supposed to feel like you're worth anything?'\n\nLynn took her two girls, Moorer then 14 and Shelby 17, to a new home in 1986, finally leaving her husband. But on August 12 Moorer says she was woken by gunshots and found both her parents dead on the front yard.\n\nFranklin had shot Lynn before killing himself. Moorer told CBS: 'I think he just broke.'\n\nOf her sister Moorer adds: 'It's a difficult thing to walk through the world and not belong to anyone. So, we belong to each other, and we have always felt like that.'\n\nMoorer, who has not been back to the house, said: 'The tragedy colors everything and all the good feels a bit bittersweet.'\n\nCountry singer Allison Moorer, pictured, has spoken about forgiving her father who 'broke' before killing her mother and then himself when she was just 14 in a new memoir\n\nOf her older sister, Grammy-winning singer Shelby Lynne, Moorer adds: 'It's a difficult thing to walk through the world and not belong to anyone.

'And most heartbreakingly what you feel. Because nobody's supposed to talk about Daddy's drinking.'\n\nBut she adds: 'My mama was a great mama. And she is why I'm okay. She is why my sister is okay. She never ever let me believe that I was not loved.'\n\nOf her father she says she feels 'nothing but love' after 'time, investigation, wllingness, and having a little boy'.\n\nShe said: 'I got to see and experience a little boy and know that my daddy was one at one time.'\n\nOf his grandparents Moorer says she will tell son John Henry they 'were troubled and beautiful, like we all are'.", "description": "The Oscar nominated star, main, is still trying to 'redeem' her parents, inset with the singer and her Grammy-winning sister Shelby Lynne.
