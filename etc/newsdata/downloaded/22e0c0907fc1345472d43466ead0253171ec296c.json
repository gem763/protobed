Trump last week announced the pullback of the U.S. military presence in the country to the consternation of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. The withdrawal has opened the way for Turkish airstrikes against Kurdish forces, who had been loyal allies to the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans in Congress have strongly condemned the move and the subsequent Turkish aggression. Democratic congressional leaders met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the issue, but the meeting devolved into an angry confrontation involving name-calling and an early walkout by the Democrats.\n\nWhen Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cited an assessment by Mattis that the withdrawal of troops from Syria allowed ISIS to rebound, Trump declared Mattis \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d and claimed credit for defeating the militant group for himself. The remark revealed the lingering bad blood from Mattis\u2019 departure from the administration in December, which came in protest to an earlier plan for a military exit from Syria.\n\nMattis had a storied military career long before the Trump presidency, having served in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq. As a retired four-star general, he was seen as a stabilizing force among the temperamental decision making of the administration. He voiced opposition to some of Trump\u2019s most contentious acts, including withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and escalating tensions with North Korea. Mattis\u2019 devotion to postwar alliances stood in contrast to the president\u2019s penchant for isolationist and transactional rhetoric.\n\nMattis\u2019 departure shook Washington and sank morale at the Pentagon, with Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) tweeting at the time: \u201cThis is scary.\u201d\n\nTrump had been dismayed at the attention Mattis\u2019 resignation received, and even tried to scoop his resignation by tweeting out that Mattis was \u201cretiring\u201d minutes before the Pentagon announcement. Though Mattis had indicated in his resignation that he\u2019d planned to serve out his role until February of this year, Trump abruptly declared on Twitter that his successor, Patrick Shanahan, would take the helm on Jan. 1.\n\nIn his December resignation letter, Mattis wrote that Trump had \u201cthe right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned,\u201d and has previously said he owed Trump a duty to keep to himself about his opinions on the president's leadership.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop the former Pentagon head from jabbing at the president on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cYou have to admit,\u201d Mattis told the dinner attendees, \u201cthat between me and Meryl, at least we had two victories.\u201d\n\nSchumer, who also attended the dinner, joined in on the jokes, tweeting out that \u201cit was great to catch up with General Mattis \u2014 the Meryl Streep of Generals.\u201d\n\nWhile President @realDonaldTrump was having another rally, it was great to catch up with General Mattis\u2014the Meryl Streep of Generals. pic.twitter.com/UHxCObLu0q \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 18, 2019\n\nStill, Mattis\u2019 levity didn\u2019t completely drown out his silence in retirement. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) quote-tweeted a video of Mattis at the dinner and urged him to speak up.\n\n\u201cYou are not a TV personality,\u201d Schatz wrote. \u201cTell us what you think. Tell us what you know. The Republic depends on people like you speaking clearly, quickly, forcefully. All hands on deck.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9c/43/8acb08434149a78549c175f524ef/191017-jim-mattis-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
