We've seen some riot police on the overpasses, but until now, the rallies have been peaceful,\" she added.\n\n\"The anti-face mask law is the first step,\" Hosun Lee, a protester in Causeway Bay, told AFP news agency, saying he feared more laws under the emergency order were on the way.\n\nHong Kong has been battered by a summer of rage as widespread public anger seethes over Chinese rule and the police response to protests.\n\nThe rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland, which fuelled fears of an erosion of liberties promised under the 50-year \"one country, two systems\" model China agreed ahead of the 1997 handover by Britain.\n\nOn Friday night after Lam announced the face mask ban, masked protesters went on a rampage in dozens of locations, trashing subway stations and businesses with mainland China ties.\n\nThe city's subway system, which carries four million people daily, was shut down entirely on Friday night and throughout Saturday, bringing much of the metropolis to a halt.\n\nMajor supermarket chains and malls announced they were closing leading to long lines and panic buying as residents stocked up on essentials.\n\nThousands of masked protesters still came out onto the streets throughout Saturday despite the mask ban and transport gridlock, although the crowds were smaller than recent rallies.\n\nSubway partially reopens\n\nOn Sunday, the subway operator said 45 stations would open but 48 remained shuttered, many of them in the heart of the city's main tourist districts as well as those areas hit hardest by the protests and vandalism.\n\nOnline forums used by the largely leaderless protest movement to organise were encouraging protesters to hold an unsanctioned rally in the city's Victoria Park later Sunday.\n\n190902111251102\n\nBut with most of the stations in that area of the city closed it was unclear if they would be able to muster decent numbers.\n\n\"It's a very clever tactic on behalf of the police because they are demobilising the groups so people can't get to the protest locations,\" said Al Jazeera's Clarke.\n\nLam has defended her use of the emergency powers and says she is willing to make more executive orders if the violence continues.\n\n\"We cannot allow rioters any more to destroy our treasured Hong Kong,\" Lam said in a video statement on Saturday.", "description": "Fresh demonstrations as High Court dismisses legal challenge by pro-democracy legislators to suspend ban on face masks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/6/d78b01e68aca412f91e9924c5e23eee2_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
