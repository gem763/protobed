In a similar poll by Gallup Korea on Sept. 22, his approval rating fell to 40 percent.\n\nOnly among respondents in their 30s was his approval rating higher than his disapproval rating at 48.4 percent to 32.1 percent but did not exceed 50 percent.\n\nThose in their 60s disapproved the most with 64.9 percent, three times the 20.3 percent who approved. Among 50-somethings, 58 percent were dissatisfied compared to 31.6 percent who said he is doing a good job.\n\nBy region, only people in Gwangju and Jeolla provinces still solidly approved of Moon with 53.9 percent.\n\nThe survey was conducted on 1,200 adults nationwide by telephone from Sept. 26 to Oct. 2.", "description": "Moon's Approval Rating Plummets Further", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/10/2019101001021_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
