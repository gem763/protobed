The companies are blowing them off.", "language": "en", "text": "Both Uber and Lyft decided not to send representatives, however, according to company and Transportation Committee officials.\n\nAD\n\nThat prompted Transportation Committee Chairman Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) to say that the panel will press ahead with legislation that could encompass safety and labor for transportation network companies, or ride-hailing companies, with or without their cooperation, according to prepared remarks he planned to deliver Wednesday that were reviewed by The Washington Post ahead of the hearing.\n\nAD\n\nUber\u2019s and Lyft\u2019s \u201cfailure to appear at this hearing is a telling sign that they would rather suffer a public lashing than answer questions on the record about their operations,\u201d DeFazio\u2019s remarks say. He says they might be trying to avoid talking about safety problems or their labor records.\n\n\u201cFor their long-term survival, and for any hope of ever partnering with agencies who utilize Federal funds, they are going to have to clean up their acts,\u201d he adds.\n\nAD\n\nThe refusal by Uber and Lyft to appear to testify is the latest wrinkle in a long-running, rocky relationship between Silicon Valley tech companies and lawmakers in the nation\u2019s capital. Many in tech believe that their companies are trying to improve the world, despite problems that may surface along the way. They believe that the government should stay out of regulating what they think is important innovation.\n\nAD\n\nJust last week, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify on the social media giant\u2019s plans to launch a cryptocurrency, Libra, after lawmakers pressured him to do so. Previously, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg planned to testify.\n\nLawmakers\u2019 attention has been drawn to Uber and Lyft after reports about the companies\u2019 safety practices and treatment of riders.\n\nAD\n\nLast month, The Post reported that employees in Uber\u2019s special investigations unit said they were under pressure to put the company\u2019s interests over the safety of passengers. Uber has said the unit\u2019s role is to \u201cprovide specialized customer support to riders and drivers dealing with very serious real-life situations.\u201d In August, The Post reported on what victims said were inadequate responses to sexual harassment and other types of misconduct on the Lyft app. Lyft vowed to make safety changes in the wake of that report and other scrutiny.\n\nAD\n\nBoth companies confirmed to the Transportation Committee this week that they do not plan to attend the hearing. Lyft confirmed Tuesday that it does not plan to attend the hearing. Uber did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLyft said it has engaged with nearly all of the subcommittee\u2019s 56 member offices in advance of the hearing and said the discussions were productive. It touted its safety practices, including driver criminal background checks, ongoing notification of violations and new features to verify drivers\u2019 identification in real time.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn communities across the country, Lyft provides economic opportunity for drivers, and affordable, reliable transportation for riders,\u201d Lyft spokeswoman Campbell Matthews said. \u201cWe take this work extremely seriously and believe safety is fundamental to these efforts.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn his prepared remarks, DeFazio criticizes the companies for their effect on urban congestion and emissions, and for opaque processes, such as their failure to publicize how they deactivate dangerous drivers or how many sexual assaults occur on the platforms.\n\nThe hearing, he said, should serve as \u201ca wake-up call to the companies that have flooded our roadways with disruptive technologies and investor capital that their days of operating with little public policy and regulatory oversight in the transportation space are coming to an end.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Uber and Lyft chose not to send representatives to a congressional inquiry aimed at examining their safety and labor practices.", "authors": ["Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation", "Including Tesla", "Uber"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-gYbX3F6kMbeVSxMYUvr5dXwFfY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SLZO3YC33AI6TGGUQRAIRUJV6I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
