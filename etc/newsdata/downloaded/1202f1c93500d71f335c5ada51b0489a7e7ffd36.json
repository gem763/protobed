He had a close relationship with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, born out of the 2006 sale of Pixar Animation Studios to Disney. Mr. Jobs was Pixar\u2019s chairman.\n\nThe resignation came on the day Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook announced a $4.99 monthly price for its streaming service, Apple TV+, and said it would become available on Nov. 1. The price undercut Disney\u2019s plan to charge $6.99 for its Disney+ service, also coming in November.\n\nApple\u2019s filing gave no reason for Mr. Iger\u2019s departure. In a statement, the company called him \u201ca dedicated, visionary CEO and a role model for an entire generation of business leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we will greatly miss his contributions as a board member, we respect his decision, and we have every expectation that our relationship with Bob and Disney will continue far into the future,\u201d Apple\u2019s statement said.\n\nMr. Iger said in a statement that his time on the Apple board was an \u201cextraordinary privilege.\u201d He added: \u201cI have the utmost respect for Tim Cook, his team at Apple, and for my fellow board members.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify why he resigned.\n\nApple\u2019s price for TV+ was widely seen as an attempt to catch up with established media competitors, including Disney and Netflix Inc., in the intensifying streaming wars and compensate for its smaller programming library. Apple plans to launch TV+ with a handful of original shows, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a drama about a morning TV news show that stars Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. The tech giant also will try to leverage its huge existing customer base, with more than 1.4 billion devices in use world-wide.\n\nThe two companies\u2019 plans to launch competing subscription-video services made it difficult for Mr. Iger to remain on the Apple board, according to a person familiar with Mr. Iger\u2019s thinking. \u201cApple\u2019s got a broader role in the media landscape,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe\u2019s reached the conclusion that there are a growing number of issues that will come up before the board that will limit his ability to fully engage and participate as a board member.\u201d\n\nApple TV+ is a much smaller part of the tech giant\u2019s overall portfolio. But remaining on the Apple board could have created at least the perception of a conflict of interest, regardless of how much or little board time was dedicated to the subject.\n\nMr. Iger told Bloomberg Television in April that he was in a \u201cconstant dialogue about making sure I\u2019m not doing anything\u201d that would conflict with \u201cwhat an Apple board member would do.\u201d He added the Apple streaming business was \u201cnascent\u201d and \u201crelatively small,\u201d so it wasn\u2019t discussed much at that time.\n\nMr. Iger has repeatedly described Disney+ as central to his company\u2019s future, as consumers give up cable-television packages in favor of streaming-service bundles of their own creation. The company\u2019s $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets was largely a bid to amass content to make Disney+ a viable competitor to Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. \u2019s Prime video service.\n\nDisney\u2019s $6.99 month price for its streaming service is itself significantly less than Netflix, which costs $12.99 a month for its standard option. Disney plans to offer Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel movie titles on the service, as well as a slew of original series and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d along with other shows and movies which it acquired in the Fox deal earlier this year.\n\nWrite to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com and Ethan Smith at ethan.smith@wsj.com", "description": "Walt Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger resigned from Apple\u2019s board, severing a yearslong connection between the two companies as they prepare to launch competing video-streaming services.", "authors": ["Tripp Mickle", "Ethan Smith", "Tripp.Mickle Wsj.Com", "Ethan.Smith Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107182/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
