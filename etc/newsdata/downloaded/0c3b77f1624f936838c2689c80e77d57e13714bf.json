Renewable energies are the opportunity for the future,\u201d Rytz said in an interview published on Monday after the Greens\u2019 best ever showing in Sunday\u2019s Swiss elections amid growing climate change concern.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s Greens gained a record 17 seats to hold 28 in the 200-seat lower house, putting them in fourth place.\n\nThe more centrist and pro-business Green Liberal Party added nine seats to control 16, leaving the right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party (SVP) weakened but still parliament\u2019s biggest force.\n\nRytz called for an all-party roundtable on the policy response to climate change in landlocked Switzerland, where temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what steps Rytz had in mind for the finance sector, whose biggest players, including UBS and Credit Suisse have increasingly made sustainable investment a watchword.\n\nBut they have faced protests by climate activists and UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti has advised caution on moving too quickly, citing risks that too abrupt a shift could wreak economic havoc on developing societies.\n\nMarie-Claire Graf, 23, who helped organise climate strikes in Switzerland, has said activists may target investment policy.\n\n\u201cPrivate banks are the main players but it will be easier to regulate the pension funds and the Swiss National Bank because they have a national mandate and are not in line with the Paris agreement so are working against our own values,\u201d she said.\n\nZurich Insurance and Swiss Re have pledged not to cover or invest in companies that generate more than 30% of their revenue from coal.\n\nEnvironmentalists\u2019 gains boost chances that parliament will approve slapping a carbon surcharge on airline tickets.\n\nThe government in August stepped up its climate ambitions, including reducing Switzerland\u2019s net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 to meet the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees.\n\nAfter the Fukushima disaster in 2011, Switzerland began phasing out nuclear power, which typically produces nearly 40% of electricity. Hydropower has a share of around 57%.", "description": "Switzerland's Greens took aim at the country's financial services sector after parliamentary election gains which shifted the balance of political power to the left.", "authors": ["Michael Shields", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
