For your weekend reading, we've started in-case-you-missed-it compilations of some of the week's top USA TODAY Opinion pieces. As always, thanks for reading, and for your feedback.\n\n\u2014 USA TODAY Opinion editors\n\nBy Paul Brandus\n\n\"Republicans accuse House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of making a 'rush to judgment' with her announcement Tuesday that she is pulling the trigger on an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. Sure: She waited nearly a year from the midterm elections. Talk about being hasty.\"\n\nImpeachment (Photo: Milt Priggee/Oak Harbor (Washington)/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Susan Wind\n\n\"After two years of painful headaches, body temperature problems, weight fluctuations and constant fatigue, my 16-year-old daughter, Taylor, was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer. ... Once it became clear that we lived in a cancer cluster and that toxic coal ash was everywhere in our town, we had to act.\"\n\nBy Laurence H. Tribe\n\n\"For a president to conscript the highest law enforcement official in the land, one paid by and legally bound to serve the American people, to do his personal and political bidding in an effort not only to smear but to also criminally prosecute a political foe is the stuff of novels about banana republics, not of the America I know and whose Constitution and laws I have spent a lifetime defending.\"\n\nTrump lawyers (Photo: RJ Matson/CQ Roll Call/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Steve Austin\n\n\"Much like the psych ward, Christians with mental illness are looking for a spiritual community that welcomes their dysfunction, disappointment and exhaustion. In the same way Jesus welcomed people to come without pretense, it\u2019s time for the church to provide a sacred place to lay down our burdens and rest.\"\n\nBy Mara Abbott\n\n\"The paper was late. ... When a flat tire on the highway delayed a recent Wednesday delivery, one man came back three times to check on the paper\u2019s status before our receptionist decided to post a note written in pink highlighter on the door. 'Today\u2019s paper will be available after 2 p.m.,' it read as I headed out for an interview. ... On my return, the time had been scratched out and amended to 4 p.m.\"\n\nBy Barbara McQuade\n\n\"The latest scandal to embroil President Donald Trump feels different from the Mueller investigation. The alleged misconduct regarding Ukraine does not require a 400-page report to understand. That\u2019s because the harm to the public is readily apparent \u2014 Trump is trading our national security for his own reelection.\"\n\nForeign interference (Photo: Adam Zyglis/The Buffalo (New York) News/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Patrick Anderson\n\n\"On Sunday at 11:59 p.m., I went on strike. ... When GM was down, we sacrificed. Now that GM is thriving, the company is trying to hurt us with reduced wages, cuts to health care and fewer benefits. Don\u2019t forget: GM received a bailout from taxpayers 10 years ago. Last year, after $11.8 billion in profits, it received a $104 million federal tax refund (while) we've faced years without wage increases.\"\n\n8. Pay attention to what Ukraine whistleblower reported, not motivations for speaking out\n\nBy Suzanne E. Durrell and David W. S. Lieberman\n\n\"Defendants want nothing more than to divert the inquiry from an examination of their crimes to the whistleblower\u2019s motives. If that strategy sounds familiar to you, it should. ... Congressional leaders ... cannot allow the inquiry to devolve from whether President Trump betrayed the oath of office into whether this whistleblower\u2019s motives are pure.\"\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
