Storms will settle down through the morning hours, and attention immediately turns to a major winter storm developing in the Northern Rockies. There are winter storm watches and warnings as well as winter weather advisories for parts of the region through the weekend.\n\nABC News\n\nA low pressure system will deepen in the Rockies today and begin to drag cold air from Canada into the western U.S.\n\nSnow will begin to expand in coverage across Montana and northern Idaho this morning and afternoon. Out ahead of the low pressure, some severe storms could develop in Kansas and western Missouri, where strong winds and large yet brief tornadoes will be possible.\n\nABC News\n\nThe low pressure will deepen Saturday evening and early Sunday with heavy snow spreading across the Northern Rockies and parts of the High Plains -- especially in the state of Montana. Winds could gust as high as 60 mph in parts of Montana today, which could cause tree and power line damage. Wind gusts of this strength could last the entire weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, some strong storms, with lightning, heavy rain and gusty winds will be possible across parts of the Midwest on Sunday, where 1-2 inches of additional rainfall is possible.\n\nABC News\n\nMore than four feet of snow will be possible through the end of the weekend in the highest elevations of Montana. However, a widespread 6-12 inches is possible across much of the northern and central parts of the state.\n\nThe National Weather Service says this heavy snow over Montana could potentially be a historic winter storm. Travel will be very dangerous across parts of the state due to the heavy snow and winds.\n\nLastly, cold air behind the storm will help bring some snow to the mountain passes from Washington to California, which could cause some travel delays and reduced visibility. Up to a foot of snow is possible in the Sierra Nevada's highest peaks. This could be potentially dangerous for those traveling in the mountains this weekend.", "description": "A major winter storm will hit the Northern Rockies this weekend, dumping more than four feet of snow with wind gusts up to 60 mph.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/tent-blown-20190928_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
