However, whether on local or national networks or in newspapers, if \u201cundocumented migrants\u201d or \u201cimmigrants\u201d are not described as the criminal trespassers they are, viewers are not getting the truth from these networks.\n\nPeople who impose themselves on this country illegally get paid under the table. They steal and devalue jobs while pilfering education, benefits, housing, health care, etc. Prosecution of illegal immigrants is being mischaracterized as unjustified racial discrimination against people of color. Why do news stories heaping responsibility on our government for family consequences resulting from the criminal behavior of foreign nationals get sympathetic priority publication and political favoritism? Isn\u2019t this promoting the same kind of lawlessness these often-coached, purported asylum seekers are supposedly fleeing?\n\nUsing the United States as the welfare system for partner countries with multi-billionaires like Carlos Slim does not fit the definition of asylum.\n\nIt appears that the advancement of the debt-ridden, supply-side scheme benefiting the few while decimating our domestic manufacturing and flooding the country with illegal labor competition is the cause celebre today. This so profoundly reverses our country\u2019s previously equitable and successful economic and trade policy that it should be considered un-American.\n\nLOUIS BOEHM\n\nOrchard Park, N.Y.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
