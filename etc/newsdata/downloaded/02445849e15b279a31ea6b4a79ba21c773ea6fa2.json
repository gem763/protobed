Only two per cent of actors actually make a living from acting alone and 90 per cent of actors are out of work at any given time so that means, more often than not, actors have to make money elsewhere.\n\nSome people might know me for my work on screen, but you may also recognise me from my roles as a receptionist, perfume seller, call centre fundraiser, incompetent waitress, antiques salesperson, administrator, promo girl, audio-typist and columnist for the Metro.co.uk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you get an acting job, even if it\u2019s well paid, it\u2019s not likely to last much longer than a year. When you\u2019ve got bills to pay, waiting for the phone to ring just isn\u2019t an option so actors take up work in other fields.\n\nThe side work you take on is also limited. Few employers are sympathetic to a worker who needs to cancel a shift last minute so they can learn three monologues, two songs, a new accent and a dance routine for an audition the following day. I must have accrued at least seven fictional dead grandparents by now.\n\nThe acting industry systemically favours those with existing privilege, financially or otherwise, therefore it is overwhelmingly white, male and middle-class. So when a talented actress from a working class background makes it into one of the most-watched shows on TV, why should she be shamed when she takes up \u2018normal\u2019 work upon departure?\n\nI think this attitude stems back to an age-old societal opinion that it is uncouth to admit when one needs money \u2013 but we\u2019re not living in an Oscar Wilde play.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got bills to pay, waiting for the phone to ring just isn\u2019t an option so actors take up work in other fields.\n\nCelebrities are built up to a dramatic climax then torn down for \u2018entertainment\u2019. But my faith in humanity was somewhat restored by the Twitter backlash this week as people expressed their disgust at such blatant job-shaming. Actors and non-actors united in support of the actress and condemned what had been written about her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a lot of class shaming at play, too. If the actress had been working as a security guard at Harrods, I doubt there would be as much interest in the story. Society needs to stop categorising people according to their pay packet.\n\nWages certainly don\u2019t reflect societal value, otherwise nurses would be on millions and a nurse\u2019s work would be deemed obsolete without a cleaner to disinfect the ward. Everyone has their part to play.\n\nActors are stereotypically quite insecure, emotional creatures and mental health issues are widespread in the creative industry. A job, any job, can give a person a sense of purpose and routine that is hugely beneficial to anyone\u2019s mental happiness. No one should be shamed for making an honest living.\n\nShowbiz is a cruel and unforgiving industry and anyone with the balls to take it on deserves respect, not shame or pity. What we see on the red carpet is just the tip of the iceberg. We don\u2019t see the late nights, the early starts, the rejection, the criticism, the family members asking when they\u2019re going to see you next on TV \u2013 and your face when you don\u2019t know how to answer.\n\nMost of the people I went to drama school have made the jump from acting into other professions. Is that a failure? No. At any rate they seem to have a lot more money, security and peace of mind than those of us still in the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter I had finished a TV job and had months to wait until my next acting gig, I was anxious about going back to my \u2018other\u2019 job to make ends meet. I was worried about what people would think. That they would see me as a failure.\n\nThen I realised the only thing that mattered was how I saw myself and in reality, nobody actually gives a toss.\n\nWe all love a rags to riches story, but success isn\u2019t linear like that. Like a good dramatic plot structure, success has its ups, downs, twists and turns and the protagonist will always have obstacles to overcome in order to get what they want. It\u2019s how they tackle those obstacles that reveals their true character.\n\nMORE: Like Posh, Mutya and Michelle before her, Jesy Nelson is not alone in being singled out\n\nMORE: Dear advertisers, stop trying to sell me Kylie Jenner\u2019s face\n\nMORE: I love my small boobs and refuse to be photoshopped\n\nMORE: Why I hate the term \u2018strong female character\u2019", "description": "Nicola Thorp's weekly column for Metro.co.uk", "authors": ["Nicola Thorp", "Actor", "Equality Campaigner"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1168036667_1572008893.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
