The pact runs to March 2020 and the producers meet to review policy on Dec. 5-6.\n\n\"We are of the view that an extension of current cuts is path of least resistance for the producer group, while deeper cuts will be far more difficult to agree on,\" Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas (PA: ) in London said.\n\nMoney managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Oct. 22, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.
