REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/Files\n\nCelebrating its 100th anniversary, Tesco, which has a 27.4% share of Britain\u2019s grocery market, is five years into a recovery plan that Lewis launched after a 2014 accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading.\n\nMurphy will become the second outsider to lead Tesco, following in the footsteps of former Unilever executive Lewis. And like Lewis, the 52-year old Irish national also has experience in the consumer goods industry - key suppliers to supermarkets - having started his career at Procter & Gamble.\n\n\u201cNow is the right time for me to pass on the baton, our turnaround is complete,\u201d Lewis told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve delivered all the metrics we set for ourselves, the leadership team is very strong, our strategy is clear and it is delivering,\u201d he said, adding he was not leaving for another job.\n\nThe announcement of Lewis\u2019s departure came as Tesco beat forecasts with a 25% rise in first-half operating profit before one of items of 1.4 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) and hiked its interim dividend 58.7%, underlining the progress he has made.\n\nShares in the group were up 1.8% at 0900 GMT.\n\nTesco was on its knees when Lewis joined, but has since met all his turnaround goals, including a key margin target of earning between 3.5 pence and 4 pence of profit for every pound customers spend. The first half profit margin was 3.67%.\n\n\u201cPut quite simply he is the bloke that saved Tesco, which should go down as an enormous achievement in British retail history,\u201d said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. \u201cMurphy has big shoes to fill.\u201d\n\nTesco shares have risen 6% since Lewis started in September 2014, while the FTSE 100 index had risen 8.5% in the same period. Lewis, however, noted that Tesco\u2019s share price had increased about 40% since October 2014 when the group reported the full extent of the accounting irregularities.\n\nLewis overhauled Tesco\u2019s relationship with suppliers, lowered prices versus competitors, simplified product ranges and improved store standards. Jobs have also been cut, including 4,500 announced in August.\n\nThe 54-year-old also pursued growth by buying wholesaler Booker for nearly 4 billion pounds, forming a global purchasing alliance with Carrefour (CARR.PA) and launching a new discount format called Jack\u2019s.\n\nTesco chairman John Allan said Lewis had indicated to him a year ago of his plan for a 2020 departure, kicking off a succession process that also considered internal candidates.\n\nHe said Charles Wilson, the boss of Booker who was once seen as the frontrunner to succeed Lewis, did not want to be considered for the job.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nMurphy was joint chief operating officer at Boots UK & Ireland before rising to executive vice president, chief commercial officer and president global brands at Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n\nHe left his executive position at the U.S. retailer at the end of 2018 but retained a consultancy role, Tesco said.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a combination of experience, proven leadership in international retail businesses, a strong strategic mind and a track record in commercial and brand,\u201d said Chairman John Allan.\n\n\u201cDave will be a hard act to follow, but Ken is unquestionably a seasoned, growth orientated business leader.\u201d\n\nGiven contractual commitments to Walgreens, Murphy\u2019s precise start date will be announced in due course. He will join on a basic annual salary of 1.35 million pounds, compared with the 1.25 million that Lewis earned in the 2018-19 financial year.\n\nLewis said he did not know if he had another big job in him.\n\n\u201cFrom the middle of next year I intend to take some proper time out with my family, re-charge the batteries and then think about what might come next,\u201d he said.\n\nTesco also said on Wednesday it planned to step up its store opening programme and double its online capacity in the UK. It has also acquired wholesaler Best Food Logistics for a nominal sum.\n\nThe group said it had made a strong start to the year.\n\nHowever, UK like-for-like sales fell 0.3% over the full half year, having increased 0.4% in the first quarter.\n\nThe outcome partly reflected a tough comparative in the second quarter last year when a heatwave and the men\u2019s soccer World Cup boosted demand.\n\n($1 = 0.8153 pounds)", "description": "Tesco boss Dave Lewis will step down next summer after declaring the turnaround of Britain's biggest retailer complete, handing over to Ken Murphy, a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance .", "authors": ["James Davey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436152486&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910DE"}
