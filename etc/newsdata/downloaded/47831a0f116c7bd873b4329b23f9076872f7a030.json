The traditions are hundreds of years old and draw on Roman Catholicism, the Afro-Caribbean religion Santeria and indigenous rituals - all set to a pulse of constant drumming.\n\nAccording to legend, Maria Lionza came from the mountain at Sorte, which is near the northwestern town of Chivacoa.\n\nThe main day is Oct. 12, observed by many Latin Americans as Indigenous People\u2019s Day, but many participants camp in tents among the old-growth forest while dedicating several days to the spiritual ceremonies.\n\nThose immersed in the old rituals say they are put into a trance that allows them to channel spirits and escape injury from otherwise dangerous feats.\n\nAt this year\u2019s opening event Saturday, Francisco Verdaguer hurled his body through flames and danced across red-hot coals. He circled the flames through the night, striking his forehead with a smoldering club.\n\nNone of that left a single mark on his flesh, he said later.\n\n\u201cI feel good, thank God,\u201d Verdaguer said. \u201cMy feet are fine, and my body is free of any burns. Above all, I thank the divine trinity - the Father, Son and Holy Ghost - and my holy mother, Queen Maria Lionza.\u201d\n\nA man also in the circle bit into a stick of glowing embers, while yet another wearing a red cape summoned a Viking spirit. Adopting a strange, gruff voice and speaking a mythical language, he shouted words to heal those around him.\n\nMaria Lionza is looked to by many across the country. She is memorialized in a salsa song popular among Venezuelans, and a statue of her naked and sitting astride a wild tapir stands in the center-divide of a Caracas highway.\n\nAs Venezuela has sunk deeper into economic and social crisis after two decades of socialist rule, devotees say their numbers have swollen as people look for answers to their daily struggles outside the political system and churches.\n\nIn various healing ceremonies, a man who had summoned a spirit slashed at his tongue with a razor and jabbed it into his bare chest. Blood smeared his face and dripped down his chest, while those gathered around cheered.\n\nOther men lay motionless and face-up in the dirt amid candles and elaborate drawings in white power as onlookers pass through them and step over their bodies.\n\nJenny Campos said she is a true believer. A shaman once performed a ceremony over her at Sorte before a major surgery on her ovaries, and she credits that with a quick recovery.\n\n\u201cHe told me you won\u2019t need to spend much time in the hospital after having surgery,\u201d Campos said. \u201cIt was a big operation, but after two days my stitches were already healed.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Every year, thousands trek to a mountainside in Venezuela for rituals played out with fire, blood and smoke to pay tribute to the indigenous goddess Maria Lionza, who is revered across the crisis-stricken South American nation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/venezuela_indigenous_goddess_74794_c0-216-5184-3240_s1200x700.jpg?48c42b2789ee0d08ce9a91ab8317603cc81a12f8", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
