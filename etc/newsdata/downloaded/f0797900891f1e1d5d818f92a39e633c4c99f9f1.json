We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nNow, in addition to the games not being broadcast, it looks as if the games might not be played at all. Images flooded social media on Wednesday, of workers removing NBA signage from arenas in Shanghai.\n\nWatch:\n\nAll over Shanghai, they\u2019re taking down banners and signs for the NBA in general, and for Thursday\u2019s Lakers-Nets game specifically.\n\nGame is still officially \u201con\u201d\u2026as of now. Lots of shrugged shoulders over whether it will actually happen. pic.twitter.com/6MFqnWGjFN \u2014 Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) October 9, 2019\n\nShanghai is removing NBA ads.\n\nGoodbye to the NBA. pic.twitter.com/8DeXdOcc63 \u2014 XIJIN LI (@XijinLi) October 9, 2019\n\nWorkers have also begun painting over Rockets logos in Shanghai:\n\nWatch:\n\nThe NBA's relationship with China is evaporating.
