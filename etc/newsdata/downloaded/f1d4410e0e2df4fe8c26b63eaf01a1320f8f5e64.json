The eight listed plaintiffs gained class-action status in April of this year, and mostly comprise pension funds.\n\nThey allege that Tesla acquired SolarCity \u2014 which was cofounded by Musk's cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive \u2014 for an inflated price.\n\nRead more: Tesla is now facing its most dangerous adversary yet, and it could be proof that buying SolarCity was a huge blunder\n\nThe suit claims that SolarCity was by 2015 barrelling towards a \"major liquidity crisis,\" and that Musk used SpaceX to buy a total of $255 million in SolarCity bonds from March 2015 to March 2016.\n\n\"These bond purchases violated SpaceX's own internal policy, and SolarCity was the only public company in which SpaceX made any investments,\" the suit says.\n\nThe suit further alleges that following a meeting between Musk and Lyndon Rive at a family vacation at Lake Tahoe in 2016, Musk convened an \"emergency meeting\" of the Tesla board and told his CFO Jason Wheeler to pitch acquiring SolarCity.\n\nSolarCity cofounder and former CEO Lyndon Rive.
