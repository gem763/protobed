(Zoltan Balogh/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nAs results of local elections were finalized, Hungarians were coming around to the idea on Monday that their longtime populist leader Viktor Orban may not be as invincible as he has long seemed.\n\nInitial results show a clear win for the opposition in the mayor\u2019s race in the capital Budapest and other victories over the ruling party in at least 10 of the country\u2019s biggest 23 cities.\n\nWith 98 percent of ballot papers counted from Sunday\u2019s elections, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony of the opposition had secured 51 percent of the vote, compared to 44 percent for the candidate from Orban\u2019s Fidesz party.\n\nThe new opposition mayor pledged to build a transparent, green and reputable city, comparing the race to the Istanbul elections in March, where the ruling party also suffered a humiliating loss.\n\nIt is a major blow to Orban, the country\u2019s four-term prime minister who has helped foster a new era of autocracy in the country. He has crushed the independent press and brought under control supposedly independent branches of the government.\n\n[Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban has bashed Europe for years. Will Europe\u2019s most important political party finally kick him out?]\n\n\n\nOutgoing Mayor of Budapest and candidate of the governing Fidesz-KDNP party Istvan Tarlos (C) speaks during the governing Fidesz-KDNP party's event after the nationwide local elections in Budapest, Hungary, Oct. 13, 2019.

I think this might be the first crack in the system built by Orban.\u201d\n\nThe win came after close, unprecedented cooperation between opposition parties from across the political spectrum, which jointly fielded candidates in many cities. In many places, just one candidate stood against Fidesz, consolidating the opposition vote.\n\nThe strategy is seen as a test case for the next general election in 2022, and other opposition parties in Europe are likely to be watching with interest. In Poland, where the populist Law and Justice party looked to have won a new four-year term after parliamentary elections on Sunday, the opposition was weak and fractured.\n\nIn Hungary, Orban\u2019s party is also embroiled in a sex scandal, despite its efforts to position itself as a defender of conservative Christian family values. A prominent Fidesz Mayor Zsolt Borkai refused to step down after footage show the married father of two participating in a cocaine-fueled orgy on a yacht.\n\n\u201cI think in many battleground cities this was the decisive factor in the last few days, and maybe in Budapest also,\u201d said Biro-Nagy.\n\nSpeaking after the opposition victory in Budapest, Orban said he would \u201ctake note\u201d of the result. \u201cAll we can say is that we are ready to cooperate in the interests of the people living in the country and in Budapest,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nHungary\u2019s Orban hopes a rabbi can save his country\u2019s controversial new Holocaust museum\n\nHungary\u2019s Orban wants to reverse his country\u2019s shrinking population through tax breaks.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Opposition victories in Budapest and other cities could mean Orban\u2019s popularity has peaked.", "authors": ["Loveday Morris", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/p7ldV8O_eVI4tfMWvfr8JcEum4U=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3RGQ6JXONQI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
