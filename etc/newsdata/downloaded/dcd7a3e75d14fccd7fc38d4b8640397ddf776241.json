But he hasn\u2019t missed a day on the show, which tapes episodes in advance.\n\nTrebek said his goals for the summer were to get his strength and hair back, and his progress on both fronts was dismal.\n\nThere have been no changes to this season\u2019s taping and production schedule, producer Sony Pictures Television said. Trebek is taping the Tournament of Champions shows Tuesday and Wednesday as planned. Those episodes, with last season\u2019s star James Holzhauer among the 15 contestants, will air Nov. 4-15.\n\nSo far, 40 episodes have been taped out of the 230 planned. \u201cJeopardy!\u201d typically has a compressed shooting schedule which, as Trebek has said, gives him long breaks.\n\nTrebek said he didn\u2019t feel terrible, although he had fatigue and occasional pain in his back.\n\n\u201cThere are moments when, for no reason at all, I feel this surge of sadness, depression,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t last for very long, but it takes over your whole being for a period of time.\u201d\n\nWhile he\u2019s concerned about what his passing would mean for his loved ones, Trebek said he\u2019s not afraid of what lies ahead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 79 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had one hell of a good life.\u201d", "description": "Trebek told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday that after a short period of optimism when he stopped chemotherapy, his \u201cnumbers shot up\u201d and doctors...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF261_alextr_ZG_20190307120447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
