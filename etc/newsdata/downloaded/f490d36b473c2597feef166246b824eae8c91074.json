That is bang on-message with #MeToo Hollywood, but Ad Astra also brings home how gendered the space film has always been.\n\nFactually minded films from this genre \u2013 The Right Stuff, Apollo 13, First Man \u2013 have had little choice but to reflect the male-dominated reality, but men have also dominated the more far-fetched solo missions (Moon, The Martian) and team efforts such as 2001 or Space Cowboys. The latter hit the nail on the head. The final frontier was an extension of the wild western one: a realm of macho ruggedness, where any hint of emotion could jeopardise the mission. This was man\u2019s work; women could make do with \u201cconcerned wife back on Earth\u201d roles. And if this made for somewhat dull heroes, blame Nasa\u2019s psychological screening programme. Women in space have often been overstated counters to all this testosterone: emotional, intuitive, vulnerable; more likely to be found in their underwear. Think of Sandra Bullock and her zero-gravity tears in Gravity, or Jodie Foster in Contact. Even Sigourney Weaver\u2019s Ripley started off as a vulnerable female (in her underwear) in Alien.\n\nNext up, Lucy in the Sky sees Natalie Portman as a Nasa astronaut transformed by her first mission and desperate to return, although her affair with colleague Jon Hamm leads to gossip about her \u201cinconsistency\u201d. Eva Green is also training as an astronaut in new movie Proxima, but she is pulled back to Earth by her attachment to her daughter. In both cases, these women are out of place in this manliest of men\u2019s worlds. Lucy in the Sky is loosely based on Lisa Nowak, a Nasa astronaut who was charged in 2007 with attempted kidnap of her Nasa lover\u2019s girlfriend, but veteran astronaut Marsha Ivins has already pushed back against the movie, questioning why this rare story about a female astronaut opted to show one losing her marbles.\n\nCould the answer lie behind the camera? Apart from Proxima, all of these films were directed and written by men. This year we have had one of the first genuine female-made space movies: Claire Denis\u2019 High Life, and look how it blew those gender frontiers apart with Juliette Binoche as a sexually voracious scientist and Robert Pattinson as a gentle dad. There has always been a more enlightened strain of space film \u2013 from Star Trek to Interstellar \u2013 but it is often set far into the future. We might be getting closer, but that time still feels lightyears away.", "description": "Brad Pitt\u2019s saga is the latest sci-fi film to fall back on stereotypes of heroic men and emotional women", "authors": ["Steve Rose"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ab774de532317ce5b4a09bd02fbc59e3fbb8a2/0_12_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a6f210c8435fd3cb8c789485c15b07d", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
