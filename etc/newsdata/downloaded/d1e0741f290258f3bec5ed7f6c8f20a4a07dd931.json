Two were accused of raping the same 11-year-old girl. Another reportedly tried to kill his victim by choking her in a hallway of her apartment building.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, tweeted a debate challenge to Elrich (D) over the merits of what Cuccinelli described as the county\u2019s sanctuary protection policies for undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll defend children and crime victims,\u201d Cuccinelli wrote, \u201cElrich can defend rapists and murders who shouldn\u2019t even be in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stunt,\u201d Elrich shot back in an interview Friday. \u201cI might debate him if he\u2019d agree with the statement that Montgomery County is not a \u2018sanctuary city\u2019 and that Montgomery County is not protecting criminals. . . . The guys in jail would probably not feel very protected.\u201d\n\n(2/3) If MontCo Chairman Elrich thinks the sanctuary policy they are so proud of is so good, I challenge him to a debate on the subject. Neutral location (e.g. cspan or webcast w/no audience present). 1 hr total, 2.5 min open & close, w/alternating 5 min blocks determined by lot. \u2014 USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli (@USCISCuccinelli) September 6, 2019\n\nAt the heart of the sharp political clash is a policy debate about how local jails respond to federal \u201cdetainer\u201d requests, which Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents use to try to have jails alert them when a criminal suspect whom federal officials suspect is in the country illegally is about to be released from custody.\n\nSome jurisdictions \u2014 including Frederick County, Md., just north of Montgomery County \u2014 have robust cooperating agreements. Local officials not only alert federal agents of pending releases, they give the federal agents up to 48 hours to get there to pick up a suspect with a detainer. Their reasoning is that given logistics such as staffing levels, traffic tie-ups and trying to coordinate detainee transfers, holding suspects for ICE makes sense.\n\nOther areas don\u2019t honor detainer requests, thinking that avoiding the process completely assures their residents that local officials aren\u2019t communicating at any level with ICE and assisting in deportation efforts.\n\nElrich, who took office last year, moved Montgomery closer to the second group.\n\nUnder him, jail officials notify ICE of a pending release of someone with a detainer who has been charged with serious crimes such as murders, sex assaults and violent assaults.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sympathetic that I\u2019m going to turn my back on people committing crimes \u2014 no way,\u201d Elrich said.\n\nElrich also recently directed county jail officials not to allow ICE agents into the secure, locked portions of jails, a shift made as part of a broader executive order restricting the agents from any \u201cnonpublic space within a government facility.\u201d\n\nAs a result, ICE agents who make it to the Montgomery County jail within what ICE says is a roughly hour window must wait in areas with the general public to take custody of someone, or be left to go later to the suspect\u2019s listed address or another location they are known to stay.\n\nThat approach seems correct, said Gustavo Torres, executive director of Casa de Maryland, an immigrant rights group, who said Elrich\u2019s policy gives ICE a chance to pick up the most violent suspects, but not detain anyone longer than necessary and not engage in any kind of immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy when crimes committed by anyone get politicized,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to let the judiciary process play out for the suspects and focus on the victims of these terrible crimes and their families.\u201d\n\nBut the Montgomery approach makes it more difficult for ICE agents to do their jobs, Frank Madrigal, an ICE deputy field office director in Baltimore, said in written responses to questions last week. That, along with the ban against allowing them into the secured areas of the jail, makes it \u201cmore dangerous for the officers, heightens risk for the targeted individuals and even the public, and is resource intensive for ICE,\u201d Madrigal wrote.\n\nEarlier coverage: Suspects indicted in alleged rape of 11-year-old girl\n\nCritics within Montgomery say tepid compliance with detainer requests is a draw for people apt to commit local crimes.\n\n\u201cThat makes the county less safe,\u201d said Alexander Bush, chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Party.\n\nHe and others cite the recent case of Rodrigo Castro-Montejo, 25, arrested Aug. 11 on charges of second-degree rape for allegedly forcing himself on a friend who was too intoxicated to consent to sex, according to a police account in court documents.\n\nOn Aug. 12, ICE filed a detainer request with Montgomery jail officials, asking to be notified if Castro-Montejo was set to be released. A short time later, when the jail learned Castro-Montejo was preparing to post bond in his local case and leave jail, a jail official called an ICE agent about the impending release.\n\nAccording to ICE and Montgomery officials, the federal agent was off duty and on travel status, and no one at the jail called a 24-hour backup number listed on detainer requests. Castro-Montejo was released from custody. He has an upcoming court date of Sept. 17 in the Montgomery case.\n\nCastro-Montejo\u2019s attorney, Barry Helfand, said his client wants to fight the allegations.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d Helfand said. \u201cWe believe he\u2019s innocent, and we think a jury will believe that, too.\u201d\n\nElrich acknowledged the county\u2019s error and said he is ensuring the backup number is called when an agent cannot be reached directly. He said Friday he is open to possibly allowing ICE back into the Montgomery Detention Center to take custody of suspects facing release who have detainers in place.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a conversation about whether we\u2019re putting anybody in jeopardy\u201d by requiring ICE agents to wait or act in public places rather than the controlled confines of a secured area in the jail, he said.\n\nThe limited cooperation, Elrich said, should still be reassuring to undocumented residents that the county is not closely linked to immigration enforcement agents.\n\nLike Castro-Montejo\u2019s case, the six others that vaulted to national attention all include detainer requests from ICE. The agency has said all seven are \u201cunlawfully present\u201d in the country.\n\nFive of those suspects are in the county jail pending trials \u2014 four of them held without bond on serious charges that preclude release, which Elrich noted moots the urgency in the detainer debate.\n\nThe remaining suspect, Nestor Lopez-Guzman, was in the Montgomery Detention Center on Aug. 19 when he gave notice he was about to post a $15,000 bond. He is charged with two counts of child sex abuse for alleged fondling and improper touching of two victims, according to police accusations in court filings. Online court records do not list an attorney for him.\n\nICE officials said they were able to take \u201ccustody of Lopez-Guzman pursuant to the detainer.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Lopez-Guzman posted an immigration bond and was released, pending further court or removal actions.\n\n\u201cTheir actions demonstrate that they are, oddly enough, bound by the same laws we are,\u201d Elrich said. \u201cThe fact that ICE picked you up doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to stay off the streets either.\u201d\n\nCases wind down for teens charged in Damascus High School locker room attacks\n\nMan spends 82 days in jail after bringing honey into the U.S.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The county executive had said he would have very limited cooperation with federal immigration agents, roiling some political waters.", "authors": ["Dan Morse", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Crime In Montgomery County"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NIK4N2QFIMI6TFMMBJQBEJX7NM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
