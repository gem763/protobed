L\u2019intervention rapide et efficace de nos experts en cybers\u00e9curit\u00e9 a permis de continuer \u00e0 assurer la bonne diffusion des programmes sur l\u2019ensemble de nos antennes TV et radio. \u2014 Groupe M6 (@M6Groupe) October 13, 2019\n\nHowever, according to French newspaper L'Express, the company did not escape the incident unscathed, with phone lines and email servers still being down today, on Monday.\n\nIn hindsight, the French TV station dodged a major bullet and should be thanking its staff for the prompt response that limited the ransomware's impact.\n\nFor example, The Weather Channel went off the air for 90 minutes in April this year following a similar ransomware incident.\n\nSimilarly, CBS-owned Entercom, the biggest radio broadcaster in the US, also suffered a similar incident. None of the company's radio stations went off the air, but the ransomware infection took email servers and internal networks offline for almost two weeks.\n\nNevertheless, none of these two incidents were on the M6 team's mind when they first responded to the malware incident on Saturday.\n\nFrench TV stations live in horror of the TV5 Monde cyber-attack repeating. On April 8, 2015, Russian hackers breached the TV station's network, took its live feed down for hours, defaced its website and social media account, and came within hours of destroying the TV network's data, according to the TV5 Monde boss.\n\nThe hack was initially claimed by an ISIS-linked hacker group known as the Cyber Caliphate, but was later attributed to one of Russia's elite cyber-espionage teams known as Fancy Bear.", "description": "Unlike The Weather Channel earlier this year, M6 remained on the air.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/14/7161022a-6732-428e-aa76-a00621793acf/thumbnail/770x578/32bd21cb252965270fdaca5644af53eb/cameraman-tv-broadcast-station.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
