The change is coming whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nThunberg spoke for several minutes to a crowd of several thousand at Civic Center Park near the state capitol building. The rally highlighted Colorado activists, like Madhvi Chittoor, 8, who has campaigned in the state against plastics.\n\nThunberg again scolded leaders for not doing enough to fight climate change and for ignoring science. Echoing a line from an angry speech at the United Nations last month that drew global attention, she said several times of leaders, \u201cHow dare they,\u201d with some in the crowd repeating the line.\n\nGreta Thunberg condemns world leaders in emotional speech at UN Read more\n\nThunberg began holding solitary demonstrations outside Sweden\u2019s parliament in August 2018, skipping classes once a week to protest about climate change. Her \u201cFridays for Future\u201d demonstrations have inspired millions across the world to stage protests urging leaders to tackle global warming.\n\nThunberg\u2019s Denver appearance followed rallies in North Dakota\u2019s Standing Rock Indian Reservation and in Rapid City and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. She plans to keep touring the Americas through a UN climate conference in Chile in December.\n\nThunberg began her remarks by acknowledging that the crowd had gathered on land that once belonged to the Cheyenne and Arapahoe tribes.\n\nGreta Thunberg, favourite to win Nobel peace prize, honoured at Standing Rock Read more\n\nThose attending included fourth graders from the Downtown Denver Expeditionary School who have been studying climate change.\n\nZariah Edwards, 9, said she had learned to unplug appliances when not using them, to save energy. Malisse Doung, also 9, said her class learned how the changing climate was affecting polar bears.\n\nEllie Rusinova of Denver was among a group of adults taking photos of Thunberg with their cellphones from the edge of the park\u2019s amphitheater. She said she thought Thunberg\u2019s plain and clear way of speaking was very powerful and captured the feelings of many. \u201cWe have all felt that we need to make a change,\u201d she said.", "description": "At rally in Denver, Swedish activist again scolds leaders for ignoring science", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88efe50e6612ed1cba5601f7010fa92c03a27aee/0_17_3148_1890/master/3148.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2fddcf140b42e47621049c6548442726", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
