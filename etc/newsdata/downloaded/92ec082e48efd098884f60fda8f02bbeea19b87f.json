We were literally forced to, we had no other option.\u2019\n\nWoman found dead 15 minutes before man she knew is killed by train\n\n\u2018Every time they lowered the medication, Melody\u2019s symptoms would come back.\u2019\n\nShe said doctor\u2019s refusal to acknowledge how much the drugs helped her flew in the face of advice from staff at Great Ormond Street, Epsom Hospital, teachers and carers.\n\nAfter suffering serious symptoms, Melody was rushed into intensive care with what doctors thought was a gallstone in her bile duct.\n\nKarina says doctors then discovered signs of a pancreatitis and ended up perforating her bowel with a medical tube, causing severe bleeding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mother-of-six added: \u2018I was telling them all along that this is what would happen if they took away her medication.\u2019\n\nMelody smiles at her mum during happier times\n\nHer parents want an independent medical expert with no connection to any hospitals to back their corner at Melody\u2019s inquest\n\nOther surgeons were brought in for an emergency operation but they were unable to stop the bleeding from her pancreas.\n\nKarina says one of the doctors told her the stone was not obstructing anything and would not have caused a pancreatitis so they left it inside.\n\nKarina said: \u2018They literally closed her up and told us she only had 24 hours to live. We were absolutely hysterical.\u2019\n\nBut despite the odds, Melody kept on fighting for 11 more weeks until she eventually passed away.\n\nKarina said: \u2018She was in our arms when she died. There was blood everywhere, literally everywhere.\u2019\n\n\u2018Every time we close our eyes and go to sleep we see her bleeding in our arms.\n\n\u2018I feel like it\u2019s my fault, it\u2019s my fault I let them take away the medication.\u2019\n\nMelody\u2019s parents say there was \u2018blood everywhere\u2019 when she passed away in their arms\n\nKarina says she wants to stop other children suffering in the same way her daughter did\n\nWith an inquest set for March next year, the family are now trying to raise \u00a38,000 for a barrister and \u00a33,000 for an independent medical expert with no connection to any hospitals.\n\nKarina added: \u2018I don\u2019t want any other children to suffer like Melody did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Melody\u2019s life should not be in vain.
