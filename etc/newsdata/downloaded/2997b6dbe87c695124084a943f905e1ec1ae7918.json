But as the institution prepares to mark the 18th anniversary on Wednesday of the event that claimed nearly 3,000 lives, it is finding a role for itself far beyond its lower Manhattan home.\n\nIncreasingly, it is being tapped to advise communities that have faced tragedies of their own.\n\nThe locales are almost too numerous to mention, September 11 Memorial & Museum officials said, but they include such places as Boston (scene of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing), Orlando, Fla., (the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting) and most recently, El Paso, Texas, (the Aug. 3 Walmart shooting).\n\nMuseum officials said it wasn\u2019t their initial intention to take on this consulting role, but it has evolved that way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re as surprised by it as anyone else,\u201d said Alice M. Greenwald, president and chief executive of the institution.\n\nLines form at the entrance of the museum in New York City.

Both have become among New York City\u2019s most significant tourist attractions, with the memorial alone having drawn 48 million visitors in the past eight years.\n\nIn many ways, the September 11 Memorial & Museum has been pressed into the advisory role because there are few institutions in the country charged with its mission: to chronicle an event in recent history and to place that event in a larger, ever-evolving context.\n\nWedded to that is a level of empathy the September 11 Memorial & Museum brings to the job, said Barbara Poma, owner of Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub. As she began considering a memorial at her site, Ms. Poma reached out to the institution\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cWhen they received my call, it was with open arms,\u201d she said.\n\nThe assistance offered by the September 11 Memorial & Museum takes different forms, officials with the institution said. In many instances, they advise communities about the kind of material to gather and archive following a tragedy, from the oral testimonies of those connected to the event to the notes and trinkets left at makeshift memorials.\n\nGeorge Mironis, a volunteer at the museum, is a 9/11 survivor and decorated his vest with pins he received as gifts.

The museum reached out to the September 11 team following the Walmart shooting.\n\nBut the advice provided by the September 11 team comes in other forms. For example, Ms. Poma said she sought counsel about board development for the Pulse memorial foundation she has created.\n\nAt times, the support the September 11 team offers has little to do with creating memorials, however. In the case of the 2018 shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the September 11 Memorial & Museum simply made itself available to students from the school when they visited New York and connected them with family members of 9/11 victims.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give them a human touch,\u201d said Ms. Greenwald.\n\nStan Kopman, left, a docent at the museum, explains the meaning of the Memorial Glade.

It also hosts a variety of events, including a field hearing this past Monday of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs.\n\nThe idea, said Ms. Greenwald, is to make the September 11 Memorial & Museum more than a place to pay one\u2019s respects. She sees it as an institution that can serve as a gathering place and a source for information and ideas on a range of subjects.\n\n\u201cWe can provide perspective,\u201d Ms. Greenwald said.\n\nWrite to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "description": "The National September 11 Memorial & Museum increasingly is being tapped to advise communities that have faced tragedies of their own.", "authors": ["Charles Passy"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105664/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
