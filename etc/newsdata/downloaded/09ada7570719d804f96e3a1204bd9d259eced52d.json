The couple and their three-month-old baby, along with two adults and their twin daughters \u2014 all U.K. citizens \u2014 were arrested.\n\nIt's a moment the vacationing couple say turned into \"the scariest experience of our lives,\" according to a complaint the Connors has filed with the U.S. government.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection officials said they tried to return the group to Canada, but they were refused re-entry. After two unsuccessful attempts to contact the U.K. Consulate, the family members were turned over to ICE.\n\nIn the statement, the legal organization Aldea representing the family said nothing justifies the \"imprisonment of babies and toddlers\" and maintains the family took a wrong turn to end up on the U.S. side of the border.\n\n\"The family was travelling in a Canadian rental car, with enough Canadian money to cover the expenses of a prolonged trip by land for a family of seven, including three small children,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The family never attempted to conceal their money and in fact repeatedly requested to be allowed to use their own funds to go home. Besides sufficient funds, the family had valid passports to travel back to their country.\"", "description": "A family of seven who entered the United States illegally by driving through a ditch from British Columbia have\u00a0been sent back to the United Kingdom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322150.1571262059!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/eileen-and-david-connors.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
