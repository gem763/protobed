(AP) - The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries has confirmed that a viral disease has killed a number of deer across the state.\n\nHemorrhagic disease is a common infectious disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks occur annually in the Southeast.\n\nVirginia officials said they\u2019ve received reports from 38 counties involving 180 deer. The worst hit area is in and around Bedford and Franklin counties.\n\nOutbreaks are characterized by otherwise healthy-looking deer being found dead or dying near or in the water during late summer and early fall.\n\nThere is no vaccine or medication to combat the disease. The best predictor of the disease activity is drought.\n\nThe disease does not pose a threat to humans or domestic pets. Outbreaks typically continue until the first frost kills insects that carry the disease.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries has confirmed that a viral disease has killed a number of deer across the state.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
