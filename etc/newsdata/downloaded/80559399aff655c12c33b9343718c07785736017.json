It also prompted a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters held in Kurdish jails.\n\nTrump has praised Thursday's deal, saying it would save\"millions of lives\". Turkey cast it as a victory in its campaign to control territory more than 30 km (around 20 miles) deep into Syria and drive out Kurdish fighters from the YPG, the SDF's main Kurdish component.\n\n\"As of now, the 120-hour period is on. In this 120-hour period, the terrorist organisation, the YPG, will leave the area we identified as a safe zone,\" Erdogan told reporters after Friday prayers in Istanbul. The safe zone would be 32 km deep, and run \"440 km from the very west to the east\", he said.\n\nBut the U.S. special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, said the accord covered a smaller area where Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies were fighting, between two border towns of Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad, just 120 km away.\n\nSpeaking to journalists later on Friday, Erdogan said Turkey plans to set up 12 observation posts in northeast Syria. A map of the region showed the planned posts stretching from the Iraq border in the east to the Euphrates river 300 miles to the west.\n\nRUSSIA, IRAN FILL VACUUM\n\nWith the United States pulling its entire 1,000-strong contingent from northern Syria, the extent of Turkey's ambitions is likely to be determined by Russia and Iran, filling the vacuum created by the U.S. retreat.\n\nThe government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Moscow and Tehran, has already taken up positions in territory formerly protected by Washington, invited by the Kurds.\n\nJeffrey acknowledged that Turkey was now negotiating with Moscow and Damascus over control of areas that Washington was vacating and were not covered by the U.S.-Turkish truce pact.\n\n\"As you know we have a very convoluted situation now with Russian, Syrian army, Turkish, American, SDF and some Daesh(Islamic State) elements all floating around in a very wild way,\" Jeffrey said.\n\n\"Now, the Turks have their own discussions going on with the Russians and the Syrians in other areas of the northeast and in Manbij to the west of the Euphrates. Whether they incorporate that later into a Turkish-controlled safe zone, it was not discussed in any detail.\"\n\nThe joint U.S.-Turkish statement released after Thursday's talks said Washington and Ankara would cooperate on handling Islamic State fighters and family members held in prisons and camps - an important international concern.\n\nPence said U.S. sanctions imposed on Tuesday would be lifted once the ceasefire became permanent.\n\nIn Washington, U.S. senators who have criticized the Trump administration for failing to prevent the Turkish assault in the first place said they would press ahead with legislation to impose sanctions against Turkey, a NATO ally.\n\nThe Turkish assault began after Trump moved U.S. troops out of the way following an Oct. 6 phone call with Erdogan.\n\nTurkey says the \"safe zone\" would make room to settle up to 2 million Syrian war refugees - roughly half the number it is currently hosting - and would push back the YPG militia, which Ankara deems a terrorist group due to its links to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Turkey will set up a dozen observation posts across northeast Syria, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, insisting that a planned \"safe zone\" will extend much further than U.S. officials said was covered under a fragile ceasefire deal.
