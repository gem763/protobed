The game will also be a launch title for the planned November launch of Google's Stadia streaming service.\n\nGrand Theft Auto III\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City\n\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas\n\nBully: Scholarship Edition\n\nL.A. Noire: The Complete Edition\n\nMax Payne 3: The Complete Edition\n\nRockstar is using the marquee release as a promotion for its new proprietary PC game launcher . Pre-orders on that platform\u2014which will begin on October 9\u2014come with a free upgrade to the Premium Edition, including a number of story-mode DLC bonuses and 50 Gold Bars for use in the Red Dead Online mode. Those pre-orderers will also receive two free legacy Rockstar titles from the following selection:\n\nFor PC players who don't want to use Rockstar's launcher, the game will also be available via the Epic Games Store, Green Man Gaming, the Humble Store, and GameStop on November 5. Pre-orders on those platforms, starting October 23, will include 25 Gold Bars for Red Dead Online.\n\nRockstar announced that the game will also be available on Steam, but not until December.\n\nAfter shipping 23 million copies on consoles in just 100 days , the console version of Red Dead Redemption 2 plateaued at 25 million in August . That puts the game well behind the astronomical sales pace of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V, which sold 29 million units in 72 days back in 2013. That game went on to approach 110 million total sales as of May 2019, with 15 million of those sales coming in the 12 months following May 2018.\n\nFollowing a long and frustrating series of delays , the PC version of Grand Theft Auto finally launched 19 months after the game's 2013 release on Xbox 360 and PS3. Red Dead Redemption 2, on the other hand, is poised to hit PCs just over 12 months after its console debut.\n\nRockstar says the PC version of RDR2 \"features a range of graphical and technical enhancements for increased immersion along with new Bounty Hunting Missions, Gang Hideouts, Weapons, and more.\"", "description": "But the Steam version won't be available until December.", "authors": ["Kyle Orland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/10-24-2018_10-07-26_PM-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-10"}
