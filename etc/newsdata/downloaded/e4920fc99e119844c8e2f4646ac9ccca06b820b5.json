New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo has complained that the deduction limit and other tax changes are prompting residents to flee to Florida.\n\nEd Wollman, a founding partner who handles taxes and estates with Wollman, Gehrke & Associates in Naples, Fla., says a New York City snowbird couple with taxable income of $500,000 would pay about $50,000 in state and city income taxes. A couple with the same taxable income in Illinois would escape a tax bill of close to $25,000 by moving to a no-income-tax state, he says. In New Jersey, the savings would be nearly $32,000, in California more than $46,000 and in Connecticut more than $32,000.\n\nNevada has seen an influx of California residents fleeing the state\u2019s income tax for years, but the new limit on the federal deduction has pushed even more Californians to look at Nevada or other no-tax states, says Christopher Manes, a tax planner with Manes Law in Palm Springs, Calif. \u201cMost of my clients are high-income individuals, so changing their residency from California has obvious benefits,\u201d Mr. Manes says. \u201cBut for people in the $500,000 bracket, the state and local tax issues can be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, estate attorney Virginia Hammerle of the Hammerle Finley Law Firm in Lewisville reports an influx of snowbird clients wanting to move their tax residences from California and the East Coast. \u201cThis has become a very hot topic,\u201d Ms. Hammerle says. \u201cI\u2019ve had clients who tell me they realize savings of $50,000 to $100,000 annually.\u201d\n\n41 States that collect tax on wages and salary 13.3% California\u2019s top marginal income- tax rate, the highest in the country Income-Tax-Free States \u2022 Alaska \u2022 Florida \u2022 Nevada \u2022 New Hampshire* \u2022 South Dakota \u2022 Tennessee* \u2022 Texas \u2022 Washington \u2022 Wyoming\n\nLeaving state income taxes behind can be more complicated than it might seem. States all have their own rules about what makes someone a resident subject to their taxes. For example, if you run a business in New York, or your minor children go to school there, the state can rule that you\u2019re a New York resident for tax purposes, even if you live most of the time in another state. In some cases, the question of tax residency can come down to seemingly minor issues like where you keep your pet or your wedding pictures\u2014indicators of which house is truly your home.\n\nStates with income taxes don\u2019t want to lose that revenue, and will investigate to make sure people who have stopped paying state income tax have done so legitimately.\n\n\u201cNew York is very aggressive with residency audits. They can collect about $200 million a year this way, so it can be quite lucrative for them,\u201d Mr. Bernard says. \u201cSnowbirds can get into trouble because they might go to Florida for eight months but still be considered domiciled in New York.\u201d\n\nCatherine Frank, executive director of the North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement, suggests one solution for people who own homes in two states: Move full time to the lower-tax state. It\u2019s simpler than figuring out how to split time between two homes without running afoul of the higher-tax state\u2019s rules, and it cuts down on living expenses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always interesting to me that people do all that to save on taxes, and then they maintain two homes,\u201d Ms. Frank says. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty expensive way to live.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Connor is a writer in metropolitan Detroit.
