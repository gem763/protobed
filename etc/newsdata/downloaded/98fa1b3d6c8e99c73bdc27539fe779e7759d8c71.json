Then we knew it would go well,\u201d Mr Edwards said.\n\nSelling agent Ercan Ersan of Ray White-Erskineville, who sold the home with colleague Shaun Stoker, said a shortage of available housing in the area helped the vendors get the bumper price.\n\n\u201cThese sorts of designer homes have always been popular but there is a bit more interest because there is more confidence in the market and rates are lower,\u201d Mr Ersan said.\n\nAuctioneer James Keenan received the opening bid immediately after launching proceedings and there was spirited bidding from four of the five registered buyers.\n\nThe bids first went up in $50,000 and $25,000 increments before slowing to $10,000 and $5000 increases once the auction hit the $1.95 million mark. There were 20 bids placed.\n\nThe buyers were a couple living nearby who were impressed with the home\u2019s high level of finishes.\n\nThe property was one of just 170 homes to go under the hammer on what was a more subdued day for sales volumes due to the long weekend.\n\nMr Keenan said the number of auctions may have been down but not the buyer turnout. \u201cThe long weekend hasn\u2019t stopped anyone,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, a historic home on an 885sqm block requiring some renovations sold under the hammer for $3.92 million, beating the reserve price by $192,000.\n\nThere were six registered bidders for the house on Thames St in Balmain, with three taking part in the auction.\n\nSome of the bidders were buyer\u2019s agents who tried to slow the auction down with complicated number combinations \u2014 the opening bid was $3.423 million \u2014 but the winner ended up being a local family.\n\nSelling agent Monique Dower of Belle Property-Balmain said it a \u201cgreat result\u201d considering the condition of the property.\n\n\u201cIt needs a renovation and if you plant some trees you could got some privacy from the surrounding units,\u201d she said.\n\nThere was a crowd of about 40 people in attendance. \u201cIt was a good turnout for a rainy day on a long weekend \u2026 the buyers are out there.\u201d", "description": "A couple selling their home got a welcome surprise when their property sold at auction for considerably higher than what a neighbour got for a virtually identical home earlier this year.", "authors": ["Aidan Devine"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/05133934/capi_88f4b339c675609ad31c3e16f64d4c51_0438c4db9de1cb939be866b18d7b70eb.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
