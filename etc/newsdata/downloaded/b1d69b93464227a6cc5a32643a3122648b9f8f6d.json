Moreover, adjustment in lagging regions is slower, with adverse shocks having longer-lived negative effects on economic performance.\"\n\nWhile the concentration of jobs and wealth in parts of a country may be a \"normal feature of growth\" that would eventually bring \"catchup\" benefits to other areas, the IMF said that the process of \"convergence\" in the developed world has slowed or stopped.\n\nAreas suffering from \"persistent inefficiencies\" may be at risk of being left behind for good, the IMF said, a situation that \"can fuel discontent and political polarization, erode social trust, and threaten national cohesion\".\n\nThe IMF report also looked at the pace of structural reforms in emerging market and developing economies, finding that it was strong during the 1990s, but has slowed since the early 2000s.\n\nThe new IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, in her inaugural speech on Tuesday, urged countries to act quickly to implement structural reforms, which as IMF research has found, could raise productivity and generate enormous economic gains.\n\n\"Potential job losses from automation and shifting demographics require countries to reform the structure of their economies,\" she said. \"If we do not act, many countries will be stuck in mediocre growth.\"\n\nThe IMF report says that a reform push in areas such as governance, domestic and external finance, trade, and labor and product markets could deliver sizable output gains in the medium term.\n\nA major and comprehensive reform package might double the speed of convergence of the average emerging market and developing economy to the living standards of advanced economies, raising annual GDP growth by about 1 percentage point for some time.\n\nAt the same time, reforms take several years to deliver, and some of them \u2014 easing job protection regulation and liberalizing domestic finance \u2014 may entail greater short-term costs when carried out in bad times; \"these are best implemented under favorable economic conditions and early in authorities' electoral mandate\".\n\nReform gains also tend to be larger when governance and access to credit \u2014 two binding constraints on growth \u2014 are strong, and where labor market informality is higher \u2014 because reforms help reduce it. These findings underscore the importance of carefully tailoring reforms to country circumstances to maximize their benefits.\n\nThe report said that reforms have been \"generally more far-reaching in emerging markets than in low-income developing countries over the past few decades\".\n\nIt cited China and Egypt for positive reforms in their labor markets.\n\nReuters contributed to this story.", "description": "An increase in automation can actually deliver a \"technology shock\" to nations' less prosperous regions unprepared for job displacement, according to excerpts from the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook released Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9f4ee0a310cf3e97a082f8.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
