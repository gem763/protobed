(AP) - Antonio Brown says he is finished with the NFL.\n\nIn a Twitter rant on the morning his most recent team was getting ready to play without him, the former New England Patriots receiver says, \u201cWill not be playing in the NFL anymore.\u201d He went on to take shots at other people in football who have been accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nIncluded among them: Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who was arrested in a prostitution and sexual trafficking sting in a Florida massage parlor. He has not been punished. \u201cDifferent strokes different folks clearly,\u201d Brown wrote .\n\nAnother target was Brown\u2019s longtime Steelers teammate Ben Roethlisberger, who was suspended for four games after he was twice accused of sexual assault. \u201c4 games for Big Ben crazy world I\u2019m done with it,\u201d Brown tweeted over a screenshot of a news article about the investigation.\n\nOne of the NFL\u2019s most prolific receivers for a decade, Brown was traded out of Pittsburgh and released in Oakland after his off-field antics became too much for those teams. The Patriots signed him anyway, and just days later a woman filed a civil lawsuit in Florida accusing him of rape. He played in one game, then was released after the team learned he tried to intimidate a second woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nBrown\u2019s first tweet on Sunday seemed to be indicate that a fight over his $9 million signing bonus is headed for a union grievance.\n\nThe first payment of the bonus was due on Monday, and the Patriots have not paid. The team is attempting to void the deal and withhold the money, even after playing him in one game after knowing about two separate accusations of sexual misconduct, one of them including an allegation of rape.\n\nBrown had also been guaranteed $29 million by the Raiders.\n\n\u201cWill not be playing in the @NFL anymore,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese owners can cancel deals do whatever they want at anytime we will see if the @NFLPA hold them accountable sad they can just void guarantees anytime going on 40m 2 months will see if they pay up !\u201d\n\nBrown also appeared to condone threats made against the Sports Illustrated writer whose article included the allegations that led to Brown\u2019s release. Over a news article describing the threats from some Patriots fans, Brown wrote , \u201cSystem working effectively.\u201d\n\nA four-time All-Pro who caught 837 passes over nine seasons with the Steelers, Brown wore out his welcome in Pittsburgh after he went missing for two days before the 2018 season finale. The Steelers traded him to Oakland, which signed him to a contract that would have paid him up to $50 million over the next three seasons.\n\nBut he never played a game for the Raiders, quarreling with the coach and general manager until they, too, released him. The Patriots signed him only a few hours later, giving him a one-year deal.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Antonio Brown says he is finished with the NFL.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jimmy Golen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/patriots-brown_football_88804_c0-116-2784-1739_s1770x1032.jpg?b080c25605b54e03b34510599fe29d831e995a9a", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
