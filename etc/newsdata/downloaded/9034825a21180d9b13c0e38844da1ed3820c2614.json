The hit knocked Rudolph out cold and left some of his Steelers teammates emotional as he lay motionless on the field.\n\nMINNESOTA VIKINGS FINE STEFON DIGGS OVER $200G FOR UNEXCUSED ABSENCES\n\n\u201cWhen he was on the ground, it looked like it was a lot more serious than just a simple hit,\u201d Steelers offensive lineman Alejandro Villanueva said after the game, according to ESPN. \u201cI don't like to get into details of his medical condition.
