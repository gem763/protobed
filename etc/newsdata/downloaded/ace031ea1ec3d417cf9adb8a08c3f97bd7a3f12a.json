In a 2018 report, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that \"the wealth gaps between upper-income families and lower- and middle-income families in 2016 were at the highest levels recorded.\"\n\nWhile upper-class families have \"more than recovered from the losses experienced during the Great Recession,\" Pew notes, \"the wealth of lower- and middle-income families in 2016 was comparable to 1989 levels. Thus, even as the American middle class appears not to be shrinking (for now), it continues to fall further behind upper-income households financially.\"\n\nHere's the breakdown of how much money you or your household have to earn each year to be considered upper-class, depending on the size of your family:\n\nHousehold of one: Minimum of $78,281\n\nHousehold of two: Minimum of $110,706\n\nHousehold of three: Minimum of $135,586\n\nHousehold of four: Minimum of $156,561\n\nHousehold of five: Minimum of $175,041\n\nPew defines the upper class as adults whose annual household income is more than double the national median, which was $57,617 in 2016. That's after incomes have been adjusted for household size, since smaller households require less money to support the same lifestyle as larger ones.\n\nOf course, there's more to class than income: Class can also encompass net worth, education, background and occupation, for example, as well as other factors. For these purposes, however, Pew refers to income and class interchangeably.\n\nWhat it takes to be upper-class also depends on where you live. For a more accurate reflection of which group you're in, use Pew's income calculator, which adjusts for the cost of living in your area, as well as the number of people in your household.\n\nThis story originally appeared in March 2017 and has been updated to include new data.\n\nDon't miss: Here's how much money the top 1 percent have in savings\n\nLike this story?
