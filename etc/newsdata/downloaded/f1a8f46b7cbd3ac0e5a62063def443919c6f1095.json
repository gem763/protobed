Case in point: the trending Twitter hashtag \u201cAutistics for Greta.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is my SHERO!\u201d user @hmcooperauthor wrote. \u201cSuch a fearless, articulate young woman. We might be considered \u2018odd, weird, quirky\u2026.\u2019 Or whatever adjectives that you prefer to insert but I\u2019m convinced folks on the Autism Spectrum have superpowers that you all just don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\nUser @ThruThePrismArt agreed, writing, \u201cI\u2019m on the spectrum. Anyone who underestimates Greta has NO IDEA how powerful the autistic brain is when set to a specific goal. The strength of being #ActuallyAutistic is LIMITLESS.\u201d\n\nThis is it!! This is what ASD is. Passion and unending dedication to a cause. @GretaThunberg is a superhero to my daughter and all those on the spectrum. ASD is why she is who she is.

How can that ever be something bad?!\u201d\n\nAsperger\u2019s is a type of autism that was adopted under the broader autism disorder umbrella in 2013, after previously being its own diagnosis.\n\nThe disorder is characterized by having difficulty with social interactions, restricted interests, a desire for sameness, and distinctive strengths, like \u201cremarkable\u201d focus and persistence, an aptitude for recognizing patterns, and attention to detail, according to Autism Speaks.\n\nDaniel Reinhardt/picture alliance/Getty More\n\nThose strengths have served Thunberg well, as she explained on CBS This Morning that her Asperger\u2019s actually helps her in seeing the world through a different lens.\n\n\u201cIn some circumstances it can definitely be an advantage to have some kind of neurotypical diagnosis, to be neurodiverse, because that makes you different, that makes you think differently,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd especially in such a big crisis like this, when we need to think outside the box. We need to think outside our current system, we need people who think outside the box and who aren\u2019t like everyone else.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Teen Climate Activist Greta Thunberg Blasts World Leaders at the UN: \u2018How Dare You!\u2019\n\nThe interview built upon an earlier tweet she\u2019d written, in which she dismissed critics insulting her \u201clooks and differences,\u201d and instead wrote that she considered \u201cbeing different\u201d a \u201csuperpower.\u201d\n\nI'm not public about my diagnosis to \"hide\" behind it, but because I know many ignorant people still see it as an \"illness\", or something negative. And believe me, my diagnosis has limited me before. > \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) August 31, 2019", "description": "How Activist Greta Thunberg 'Destroys' Aspergers Stigma", "authors": ["Rachel Desantis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/O9hQYGWghvIuZ7QSHpoEOQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/28903872b5778a50b7f084e1406e24e9"}
