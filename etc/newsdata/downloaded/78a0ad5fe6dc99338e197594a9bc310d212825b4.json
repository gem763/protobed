These are people who have been wary since Gabbard became a Fox News favorite for criticizing Obama\u2019s foreign policy. They believed that their distrust was vindicated when Steve Bannon brought her in for a meeting with then-president-elect Donald Trump just two weeks after the 2016 election, which was one of Trump\u2019s first meetings with a Democrat. To this group, Gabbard looks like Jill Stein, who also talked about progressive politics and peace, but whose 2016 Green Party run was, to them, a self-centered campaign that blew a crucial hole in Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances, eating up money and getting Russian support along the way.\n\nRT, the Kremlin-backed news agency, often highlights Gabbard\u2019s campaign. The Russian embassy in South Africa has tweeted defensively about her, Russian bots have boosted her, and neo-Nazis bragged about helping her small-donor count so she could qualify for the first two debates. (She fell just a few polls short of qualifying for the September debate, but might make the stage once again in October.)\n\nTheories I\u2019ve heard from top Democrats include that Gabbard is trying to get a TV show\u2014\u201cI already know which network: Fox,\u201d one senior Democrat not affiliated with any campaign said, speaking anonymously to remain publicly neutral\u2014and that she\u2019s gearing up for a Trump-benefiting third-party run.", "description": "", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive"], "top_image": ""}
