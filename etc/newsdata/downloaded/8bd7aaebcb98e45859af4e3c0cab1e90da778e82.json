He\u2019s a very solid character and wherever he has been as a coach, he has been successful.\n\nNasser Hussain has praised England\u2019s appointment (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018He went over to Essex when they were in Division Two, took them into Division One and then immediately won the County Championship with them \u2013 a side that had been under-performing. He showed his pedigree there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He has since moved on to England, and look at the work he has done with the England bowlers \u2013 look at someone like Stuart Broad, for example, and the renaissance he\u2019s had.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s someone who seems to ask the right questions, at the right time. He\u2019s that type of coach \u2013 he\u2019s not an in-your-face type; he\u2019s very popular in the England dressing room, already in there with the players.\u2019\n\nHussain, who scored 14 centuries in his 96 Tests for England, added: \u2018Chris knows the time to say things and not say things.\n\nSilverwood takes over from World Cup-winning coach Trevor Bayliss (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m talking bowlers here, but he puts little ideas into their minds and makes it seem like it was almost their idea; his man-management is absolutely first class.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d say he\u2019s a safe pair of hands. When one or two others ruled themselves out, I think Ashley Giles went for someone he knows and trusts.\u2019\n\nSilverwood, meanwhile, insists he is \u2018thrilled and honoured\u2019 to become England\u2019s head coach.\n\n\u2018I aim to continue the great work that has been done over the past five years and build on our future, especially in the Test arena,\u2019 the former England bowler said.\n\nFormer Yorkshire, Middlesex and England bowler Silverwood (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I have enjoyed working with the players over the past two seasons, and developing the best crop of talent in the English game.\n\n\u2018I am excited to get started and build teams\u2019 that the whole game can be proud of. There is a tremendous amount of talent coming through, and there is enormous potential for growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The hard work starts now, and I am confident we can make a positive impact during our winter tours of New Zealand and South Africa.\u2019\n\nThis winter, England \u2013 who won the World Cup last summer before drawing the Ashes series 2-2 \u2013 tour New Zealand and South Africa.", "description": "Nasser Hussain has praised the appointment of Chris Silverwood as England head coach and says the former Yorkshire and Middlesex bowler is a 'safe pair of hands'.
