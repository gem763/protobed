In televised debates, Democratic rivals like Juli\u00e1n Castro have pressed his former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., to repudiate the large-scale deportations carried out under Mr. Obama\u2019s watch.\n\nThere have also been defiant professions of loyalty, delivered as though Mr. Obama were under siege from fellow Democrats. Mr. Biden, the Democratic front-runner, has made these moments a hallmark of his candidacy: \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad, indifferent,\u201d he said at the last debate.\n\nYet among the vast majority of Democratic voters, there is little appetite for a brawl over the merits of Mr. Obama\u2019s record. And while Mr. Obama\u2019s consensus-seeking liberalism appeals to many Democratic voters, few appear to be thinking about the 2020 primary as a forum for determining which candidate would follow Mr. Obama\u2019s exact policy blueprint.", "description": "In the Democratic primary, there have been clashes over the Obama administration\u2019s policies.
