Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s second, a chip with the outside of his foot, was exquisite while Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah also scored what their manager described as a collection of \u201cbeautiful\u201d goals. Liverpool\u2019s display, however, did not attract the same glowing tributes.\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s double flourish eases Liverpool past Genk Read more\n\nKlopp said: \u201cIt was a great moment for him but I would say Ox with his performance was exactly the same as the performance of the team \u2013 the goals were great but all the rest could have been better. That\u2019s how it is, but it\u2019s no problem. The goals were sensational and very important forus. Wonderful. On Sunday, Adam [Lallana] scored the goal and now Ox has scored two goals. It\u2019s really nice, a great story.\u201d\n\nThe Liverpool manager criticised his team\u2019s open first-half display in particular. \u201cWe looked to find the gaps and pass the ball through,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the plan and it worked OK for the first 10-15 minutes but then not anymore because we lost completely unexpected balls we were not ready for, which in the formation was not possible. . Sometimes we took in the wrong moments a risk, passing a one-two in a very tight situation makes not too much sense. They got a bit of momentum which after our start was completely unnecessary. But all our goals were unbelievably beautiful and the second was a proper knock for Genk it looked like.\u201d\n\nKlopp said he did not see a banner that was removed from the Liverpool section before kick-off for depicting Divock Origi with a large penis. Liverpool condemned the banner as \u201chighly offensive and inappropriate\u201d and pledged to act against whoever brought it into the away section. Uefa may take action against the club given the banner\u2019s obvious racial implications.\n\nGenk v Liverpool: Champions League Group E \u2013 live!

We will look to identify those responsible for bringing it into the stadium and act accordingly.\u201d", "description": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp praised Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for two \u2018sensational\u2019 goals against Genk but admitted he was less than impressed with Liverpool\u2019s overall performance", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d65e7e00d6e1c43af80640760c52e42b31436fc9/0_186_3482_2089/master/3482.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d982ba0002d5c7f55ec5a70ea49e475", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
