The plant is one of the world\u2019s largest oil processors, capable of churning out 5.7 million barrels of oil daily. Officials in the country said by Monday, they would resume one-third of the lost output.\n\n\u201cThis type of uncertainty in the world oil market will make consumers more nervous than they are already,\u201d said Professor Shanjun Li, an economist at Cornell University\u2019s SC Johnson College of Business who has studied the links between gasoline prices and consumer behavior.\n\nCompanies could also be cautious about making investments, like expanding capacity and hiring more workers. Rising gas prices in the early 2000s, coming as they did on the back of the subprime mortgage crisis, contributed to the Great Recession, he said.\n\nThe average annual gallon price was $2.02 in 2000 and $3.61 in 2008, according to Energy Department figures. The federal statistics were adjusted for inflation in 2015. A gallon of gas currently costs $2.56 according to AAA\u2019s national average price.\n\nPrevious research from the Federal Reserve said it can be tricky to know how much oil price shocks ignite a recession. Credit contractions and oil price increases usually happen around the same time, it said in a 2014 paper.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why Saudi Arabia\u2019s output hit won\u2019t lead to shocking prices at the gas pump\n\nWhatever their big picture macroeconomic effect, gas prices can loom large for individual drivers. Rising gas prices can \u201clead to an immediate deterioration in subjective well-being,\u201d said researchers looking self-reported life satisfaction from 1985 to 2005.\n\nConsumers spent $2,109 on gas, motor oil and other fuels last year, up 10% since 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Oil prices surged Monday, with barrel prices up 14%, marking the steepest daily rise in more than 10 years.\n\nUBS UBS, -1.28% Global Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said the attack was \u201cyet another headwind for a global economy that is already buffeted by deteriorating manufacturing activity and elevated trade tensions.\u201d\n\nBut he said increased gas prices alone would not be a strong enough factor to hasten a recession, which many economists expect to happen by Summer 2020. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that this short-term disruption to oil production will trigger a global recession,\u201d he said.\n\nOther market experts say the attack could seriously shake markets. But if Saudi officials get the facility back and running within a week, there shouldn\u2019t be much bottom line impact on consumers, said Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, a London-based financial services firm.", "description": "Many economists expect the next downturn to happen by Summer 2020.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR394_gas_pu_ZG_20190916150442.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
