I\u2019m not logged into my work email on my phone, I don\u2019t bring my laptop home, and I forget how to read on a nightly basis, just in case one of my editors tries to Slack me about something after I leave the office. But not everyone is lucky enough to work somewhere that tolerates an off-the-clock technology blackout, which is why the movement pushing for \u201cright to disconnect\u201d exists\u2014although it hasn\u2019t managed to score a victory in the U.S. yet.\n\nProponents of the right to disconnect argue that the pressure to answer electronic communications from work\u2014like emails, text messages, or phone calls\u2014after hours amounts to unpaid labor, at the very least, and a human rights violation at worst. A guide for employees looking to fight for their right to disconnect released Wednesday by the UNI Global Union outlines the problem as follows: \u201cTechnological developments and mobile devices have allowed employees to perform their work anywhere and at any time. While there are also benefits with this flexible approach to work, it risks eroding the barriers between working and leisure time\u2026 This constant connection and ensuing lack of rest carries important psychosocial risks for employees, including anxiety, depression, and burnout.\u201d Research backs these mental health claims, and one study found the mere expectation of work communication during leisure time triggered anxiety in workers, even if no communication actually took place.\n\nThe right to disconnect has been legislated into existence in a few countries, first by France in 2016, and subsequently Spain and Italy on a national level. According to the UNI Global Union, Belgium, Canada, India, the Philippines, and Portugal have also codified pro-disconnect measures at some level, be it state or national, and a judge in Luxembourg recently recognized an employee\u2019s right to disconnect on paid leave in an October ruling.\n\nThe only place in the U.S. where someone mounted a serious effort to legislate some kind of right to disconnect is New York City, where Councilman Rafael Espinal introduced a bill that would \u201cmake it unlawful for private employees in the city of New York to require employee [sic] to check and respond to email and other electronic communications during non-work hours.\u201d Espinal told VICE in 2018 that he saw the bill as \u201ca way to draw clear boundaries between workers\u2019 personal and work lives.\u201d Unfortunately, efforts seem to have stalled: The bill hasn\u2019t been discussed since January 2019, according to the New York City Council\u2019s official website.\n\nSo, why hasn\u2019t the right to disconnect taken off in the U.S. yet? My personal theory is that we are (and this is the technical term) too horny for work to set up healthy boundaries around our personal lives. After all, Americans get shorted on vacation days (and then short ourselves out of using them); we take the literally impossible ideal of \u201cpulling yourself up by your bootstraps\u201d seriously; and we work more hours annually per person than Italy, Canada, Australia, the U.K., France, Germany, or even Japan\u2014you know, the same Japan where the work culture is so pervasive and demanding that \u201cbusinessmen passing out in the streets\u201d is a trope! It\u2019s tough to say no to a demanding boss or resist the temptation to do a little extra work at home in the hopes of making things easier tomorrow. But trust me: It\u2019s worth letting your personal time stay personal, especially if you aren\u2019t getting paid to \u201chustle\u201d harder.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Katie Way on Twitter .", "description": "France, Luxembourg, Spain, and the Philippines have already taken steps to legislate a cap on the 8-hour work day.
