Two cabinet ministers told the paper that the plans include blocking the Union's 2021-2027 budget, which is expected to be signed off early next year, as well as sending a Eurosceptic such as Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage to Brussels as the UK\u2019s next EU commissioner.\n\nOn Saturday the approach was approved by Steve Baker, former Brexit Minister, who likened it to firing \u201ca nuclear weapon into the heart of the asteroid\u201d.\n\n\u201cI unashamedly back Nigel Farage to be our next EU commissioner in the unfortunate event that it transpires,\u201d he told Chopper\u2019s Brexit Podcast.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Independence is coming\u2019: Thousands march through Edinburgh in support of Scottish independence\n\n\u201cThis approach is inspired by the film Armageddon. There is that moment when they are trying to save the world and so what they do is they land on the asteroid and they put a nuclear weapon into the heart of the asteroid. Nigel Farage is that nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nOne problem with this plan is that the rest of the European Commission will have been ratified by the European Parliament so MEPs would have a clear vote on whether to approve the UK\u2019s nominee. Given Farage\u2019s two decades of causing trouble in Brussels MEPs are highly unlikely to wave him through as a commissioner.\n\nLike this story?
