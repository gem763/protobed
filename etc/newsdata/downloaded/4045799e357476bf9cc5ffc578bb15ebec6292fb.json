Her fianc\u00e9, Prof Rifaat al-Amin, was also given a one-year sentence, while a doctor, Mohammed Jamal Belkeziz, was given a two year sentence in the same trial for alleged complicity.\n\nOn Wednesday, Morocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI pardoned all three in a move criticised by observers as a cosmetic solution.\n\n\u201cThis royal pardon comes within a framework of royal compassion and clemency, amid concern by his majesty the King to preserve the future of the couple who intended to start a family in line with religious precepts and the law, despite the error they committed which led to the legal proceedings,\u201d declared the King, via a royal communiqu\u00e9.\n\nRaissouni, who was arrested outside a clinic in Rabat with her fianc\u00e9 on 31 August, maintained from the start that she never underwent an abortion. Both she and the medical staff arrested along with the couple said she was treated to remove a blood clot.\n\nCampaigners say that some 800 abortions take place every day in Morocco, where the procedure is illegal except when the woman\u2019s life is threatened due to pregnancy and with a husband\u2019s permission.\n\nIn a statement from prison before receiving the pardon, Raissouni said she was targeted for her work as as a journalist and for her family\u2019s history as dissidents.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that the purpose of my arrest was vengeance against my journalistic activities,\u201d she said. She added that her coverage of the Hirak protest movement in the country\u2019s northern region had put her in the crosshairs of the state.\n\nObservers said that the pardon did little to remedy the wider problems that led to Raissouni\u2019s case in the first place, in a country where critics\u2019 personal lives are sometimes publicly used to silence them.\n\n\u201cShe should not have been jailed in the first place,\u201d said an Amnesty International staff member who requested not to be named. \u201cShe must be acquitted properly of all charges and her name cleared. Targeting Hajar and intruding in her private life simply for doing her job as a journalist is another indicator of the crackdown on freedom of expression in Morocco.\u201d", "description": "Hajar Raissouni says in statement from prison that she was targeted for her work as as a journalist", "authors": ["Ruth Michaelson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0121f575bed1e426972ab55eb96dd92d1f55a783/0_272_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c498071926efb427c114429a02859fec", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
