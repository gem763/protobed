He said there was not a role in the new structure that he believed would be right for him.\n\nJohn Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said: \"These changes will be difficult for some of our Partners and we will implement as carefully and sensitively as we can.\"\n\nEmployees at John Lewis, including both management and shop floor staff, are known as \"partners\" due to the company's co-ownership model.\n\nThere would be \"little or no disruption\" for customers, he said, but the restructuring would create a more unified leadership team and cost structure.\n\nLast month, the retailer reported a half-year loss for the first time in its history amidst a difficult UK retail environment.\n\nImage copyright jeff hopkins/Waitrose\n\n\"The lesson of the last two years is that we need more innovation, faster decision-making and bolder steps to align our operating model with our strategy,\" the chairman said.\n\nThe company said of the customers that accounted for its greatest sales, the majority shopped at both its department stores and at Waitrose.\n\nRetail analyst Richard Lim said it was a \"bold\" move which should deliver cost-saving efficiencies.\n\n\"Against a backdrop of rising costs and fiercer competition, a new leaner and flexible operating model will help restore profitability during a period of rapid change within the sector,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Thomas Brereton, retail analyst at GlobalData, warned the changes would have to be implemented carefully to avoid disruption.\n\n\"The long-term impact of running a unified strategy for two retailers with such a varied proposition is questionable,\" he said.", "description": "A single management team will oversee the department store chain and Waitrose from next year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C05C/production/_109044294_johnlewisstore_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
