The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said the decision was \u201cin light of the implications of global developments for the economy outlook as well as muted inflation pressures.\u201d\n\nThe vote was 7-3 in favor of the move, with the majority of dissenters demonstrating a more hawkish bias. Kansas Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren favored leaving rates unchanged at their previous levels. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard favored cutting rates more deeply by 50 basis points.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s new projections show that central bank officials on median expect rates to stay at the new level through 2020. However, seven of 17 officials see one more 25 basis point cut as appropriate in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday Powell delivered a very hawkish policy rate cut. Although it met market expectations for a 25 basis point cut, the committee was split with officials divided on future rate moves,\u201d Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email. \u201cIn fairness, with recent economic data \u2013 such as industrial production growth and housing stats \u2013 tentatively suggesting that a trough in activity is approaching, a stabilization in growth is a more plausible scenario than an outright recession, so perhaps there is less need for further easing.\u201d\n\nThe six weeks since the Fed\u2019s July 31 rate decision have seen a bevy of global developments, which many investors had bet would make the case for further policy easing.\n\nThe U.S. and China each announced hikes to tariffs on one another\u2019s imports throughout August, before de-escalating some of these threats at the start of September. A closely watched portion of the Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time in more than a decade, flashing a reliable recessionary signal.\n\nAnd most recently, crude oil prices have surged \u2013 and then precipitously came back down \u2013 as market participants wrestled to keep pace with developments over Saudi Arabian oil supplies and geopolitical tensions after an attack on the country\u2019s oil facilities.\n\nReining in rates\n\nThe latest monetary policy decision also included a move by the Fed to try and regain control over short-term financing rates. Over the past several days, Fed has scrambled to quell a spike in short-term money-market rates, with officials spending billions to infuse liquidity into the banking system and bring the rate back down to within the Fed\u2019s target range.\n\nTo provide further relief to this issue, the Fed announced Wednesday that it would be lowering the rate it pays on reserves, bringing down both the IOER and reverse repo rate by 30 basis points \u2013 or further than the reduction in the Fed\u2019s target range.\n\nThe sudden liquidity squeeze in the overnight repurchase agreements (repo) market \u2013 where banks and Wall Street dealers lend out to one another to meet their daily financing needs \u2013 this week had been the result of a demand issue, likely caused as borrowers sought to cover corporate tax payments and settlements of newly auction U.S. Treasuries.\n\nWednesday morning, the effective federal funds rate again broke above the upper bound of central bankers\u2019 target rate, climbing to 2.3%. The New York Fed took $75 billion of securities in another overnight system repurchase agreement, after having carried out its first repo operation in a decade on Tuesday with a $53.2 billion injection of liquidity. The New York Fed said Wednesday it will conduct another repo operation Thursday with a $75 billion auction.\n\nIn a press conference after the release of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed\u2019s \u201ctemporary operations were effective in relieving funding pressures, and we expect the federal funds rate to move back into the target range.\u201d He also noted that this week\u2019s turmoil in money markets carry \u201cno implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy.\"", "description": "Stocks fell Wednesday as market participants digested the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest monetary policy decision, wherein central bank officials delivered their second rate cut of the year and pointed to further easing by the end of the year.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8K6Hd0G84sEu_i0vAA.qpA--~B/aD0zNzIyO3c9NTU4MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/bd79c6f0-da0f-11e9-9efd-5866261128ab", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
