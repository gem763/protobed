Here's how that could shape the future.", "language": "en", "text": "As climate change is thrust further into the mainstream discourse, the heat is being turned up on corporations that employ less-than-stellar environmental practices.\n\nConsumers are increasingly pushing back on non-eco-friendly procedures, and their shifting attitudes are starting to impact the stock prices of companies that do prioritize the environment.\n\nIn order to quantify the impact this shift has had on stock performance, Deutsche Bank tapped into their artificial intelligence platform, \u03b1-DIG. The firm investigated more than 5 million pages of press incorporating over 1,600 MSCI World companies, spanning the last 2 decades.\n\nDeutsche Bank ultimately arrived at a clear conclusion: caring about the environment is good for business.\n\n\"Companies that experienced positive press and announcements on climate change saw share price outperformance of 1.4 percentage points per year over the MSCI World Index \u2014 outperformance of 26%,\" the firm's research team said in a recent client note. \"Conversely, bad press results in underperformance.\"\n\nThese findings are upheld and enhanced by the chart below, which splits Deutsche Bank's universe into two distinct subsets. The black line reflects the relative outperformance of the companies that relayed the most positive climate-change news versus the MSCI World Index. That translates into a compound annual growth rate of 6.4%, versus 5.6% for the index.\n\nMeanwhile, the blue line shows the companies that have seen the largest improvements in the portion of positive climate-change news, regardless of how bad it was to start with. Their outperformance is even more pronounced: they've beaten the MSCI World gauge by 35%.\n\nThe takeaway here is that it's not too late for companies to start making strides as it pertains to ESG. And once they do, history suggests their share prices will benefit.\n\nDeutsche Bank \u03b1-DIG\n\nFurther, Deutsche Bank has projected the amount of global capital falling under an environmental, social, and governance decree to grow to 95% of AUM by 2030. That means investors who ignore this trend will have to do so at their own peril.\n\n\"Given the increasing pool of investors who pick stocks based on a company's environmental, social, and governance traits, it seems certain that positive and negative share price effects seen in the last section will amplify themselves in the future,\" Deutsche Bank said.\n\nDeutsche Bank, Global Sustainable Investment Alliance\n\nThe two charts deliver an unmistakable conclusion: the tide is shifting in favor of ESG-focused companies. And both companies and the investors who buy their stocks are being rewarded.\n\nIt's setting up a future where ESG adherence could make a crucial difference to a corporation's future, and also investor portfolios across the market.\n\n\"Once social movements hit a tipping point, they have proved very difficult to stop,\" Deutsche Bank concluded. \"Customers have spoken, investors have spoken. Those companies that do not listen will certainly be left behind.\"", "description": "Deutsche Bank research tapped into its AI platform, \u03b1-DIG, to quantify the effects company climate change initiatives had on share prices.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8391302e22af1c81733e64-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
