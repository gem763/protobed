A 2018 survey in Canada revealed that the expenses of a student living at home were $9,300 per year on average. That number rises to $20,000 per year if the student is living away from home.\n\nBy the time your child reaches university age, these numbers could easily have doubled, which begs the question: will you be ready to send your child to university without saddling them with a huge debt load?\n\nYou can get free money It isn\u2019t often that the government gives you free money for doing nothing. Luckily, your child\u2019s education is one of those rare occasions.\n\nThe best way to save for your child\u2019s education is via the Retirement Education Savings Plan (RESP). You can contribute up to $50,000 per child, with the government adding $500 per year using the Canadian Education Savings Grant (CESG), up to a total of $7,200 received. If invested wisely, this $7,200 can go a very long way.\n\nOne caveat is that grants from the CESG and CLB will be taxable income once you withdraw it. But the beauty of it is the money will be taxable under your child\u2019s income. Because they are students, they likely won\u2019t have a lot of income, so they\u2019ll have little to no tax to pay.\n\nGrow your investment tax-free One thing that isn\u2019t great about programs such as the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is that it isn\u2019t available for children under 18. Thankfully, the RESP can be a good substitute for this.\n\nLet\u2019s use the TD Bank (TSX:TD)(NYSE:TD) as an example. TD Bank is the second-largest bank by market capitalization in Canada and boasts a significant U.S. presence. TD also is the fastest-growing bank of the Big Six, mainly due to this U.S. advantage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, including stock appreciation and dividends reinvested, TD has averaged a 12.01% total return per year.\n\nIn this example, the assumption is that you will contribute $2,500 per year, receive the maximum amount of grants recommended at $7,200, and start when the baby is zero years of age.\n\nAssuming this same growth rate as TD of 12.01%, by the time your child is 18, the RESP would be worth over $139,000. If you held the investment, not within the RESP, it would be worth a lot less without the grants and the tax-free growth.\n\nIn conclusion At least we don\u2019t have it as bad as the U.S. For our neighbours to the south, with American tuition, top-tier university expenses can run as high as $80,000 per year.\n\nYou\u2019ve now seen an example of what a good dividend stock like TD held within your RESP can achieve. Investing in just one stock isn\u2019t recommended.\n\nInstead, you should spread your risk and invest in a portfolio of several stocks. Invest early in the RESP and your child should be well on his or her way to pay comfortably for the school of their choice.\n\nFool contributor Christopher Liew has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.\n\nThe Motley Fool\u2019s purpose is to help the world invest, better.
