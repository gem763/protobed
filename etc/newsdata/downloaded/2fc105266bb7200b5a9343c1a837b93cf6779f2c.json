My oldest went from getting $60 a month to about $150.\n\nWe just started, so I don't know yet whether it's making them better with money. However, their mistakes are teaching them lessons about handling money, and I'll be able to coach them on budgeting and planning.\n\nRead more personal finance coverage.\n\nMany parents give their kids the bare minimum when it comes to an allowance. For years, I gave my two children $30 every two weeks, but always found that my kids needed more. They need lunch money, new sneakers for tennis, money for fun with friends, and the list goes on and on.\n\nAs a result, I've asked them to detail every single expense they believe they will have in a budget \u2014 including school expenses, fun, grooming, and more. Once I get their crazy estimate, we negotiate a final number to something more reasonable. Then, I proceed to give them the amount we've agreed upon for the month: $150 for my 14-year-old, and $120 for my 10-year-old.\n\nWhy are we doing this? Well, at some point they will get out in the real world and have to make financial decisions based on finite resources anyway. Why not start now?\n\nGiving them more control over their spending will prepare them for life with money. My goal is to make sure I never have to dole out extra money to them once the month starts. It will take time for this to happen but I'm happy to start here and now.\n\nTo facilitate this allowance approach, we use a combination of cash and prepaid debit cards (for purchases my kids need to make online.) You can choose any number of prepaid cards that work for kids like CapitalOne, GreenDot, or FamZoo, which we use.\n\nHas raising my kids' allowance helped them get better with money?\n\nTo be perfectly honest, this is a newer approach for us and it's taking time for all of us to adjust. The good news is that as mistakes are being made, it's helping to coach my kids with their money handling skills.\n\nFor example, the latest budget my oldest, who is a teenager, created was for about $150 for the month. As you might have guessed, she spent it all well before the month was over and didn't adhere to her budget in the slightest.\n\nDoes this mean she's bad with money? Not necessarily. To me, it just means she needs to practice more with money. So, in the coming months, we'll work through some tweaks to help her stick to her budget.\n\nFor instance, I'll be introducing her to the cash envelope system. Then I'll show her a budgeting app or two to help her keep track of her spending.\n\nDo some planning before you raise your kids' allowance\n\nAs you think about giving your kids allowance, you'll have to consider your own family budget, the time you have to dole out lessons as related to allowance and even the maturity of your child before putting a good allowance system in place.\n\nSome questions to consider might include:\n\nWhat are my kids' needs beyond the basics that I already I cover for them?\n\nIs my child responsible enough to handle their own money at the moment?\n\nHow much can our family afford to give in allowance each month?\n\nWhat is expected of my child in return for a regular allowance?\n\nHow do I expect my kids to ration their money in terms of giving, saving and spending?\n\nWill my kids be charged or penalized in some way for things like bad grades, breaking house rules, or being irresponsible?\n\nHow much allowance you give them is entirely up to you. If you think it will make your child learn how to manage their money better, then I think it's worth a try. You could increase the amount slowly or put stipulations on the increase like asking for a detailed budget ahead of time.\n\nI think the main thing is that you allow your kids to make mistakes with money then provide them with some gentle coaching along the way. This way, when it's time for them to leave the nest, they'll have plenty of practice.", "description": "After years of giving my kids allowance, I realized they always needed more money.
