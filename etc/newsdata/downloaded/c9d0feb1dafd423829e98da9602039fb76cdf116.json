French women have long taught us how to work that white shirt, pair of jeans and red lips just so \u2014 but beyond the fashion and pharmacy finds, what exactly is it that French women are doing to age so well?\n\nThey tend to be tight-lipped about their cosmetic work. Rare is the Parisienne who will admit to a bit of Botox, and the phone numbers of Paris\u2019s top surgeons, dermatologists and cosmetic doctors are a well-guarded secret, not shared even between the closest of friends. France\u2019s first lady, Brigitte Macron, 66, perfectly illustrates the French beauty mystique, emerging from her summer in the Cote d\u2019Azur looking remarkably refreshed and causing many to wonder if she\u2019d had a little tweak.\n\nOlivia Falcon revealed the most coveted French practitioners available in the UK, to achieve the ageless look of stars including former Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld, 65, (pictured)\n\nBecause in France cosmetic work isn\u2019t just done discreetly, it looks discreet, too: natural and beautiful, the epitome of ageing gracefully.\n\nThankfully, however, many of Paris\u2019s star practitioners are now operating in the UK as well, offering up French women\u2019s best-loved beauty treatments, without the need to jump on the Eurostar.\n\nSo who are these highly skilled experts? And what treatments should we be trying? Here, I delve into my little black book of international contacts, built up over 15 years editing cosmetic surgery guides for the world\u2019s glossiest magazines and now as founder of a cosmetic concierge service (editors list.co.uk), to bring you the most coveted French practitioners bringing their Parisian polish to Britain . . .\n\nCULT FACIALS\n\nWhile Britain\u2019s cosmetic clinics are abuzz with high-tech machines to lift, zap and smooth away the signs of ageing, in France women still favour old-school facial massage techniques, passed down by their grandmothers.\n\nParis is the city of the super facialist; Joelle Ciccio and Herve Herau are the names to know, but no technique is more highly regarded than Martine de Richeville\u2019s Facial Remodelage \u2014 and luckily for us Brits this is now available at a dedicated de Richeville salon in West London (martinedericheville.com).\n\nBased on the rejuvenating effects of de Richeville\u2019s cult body contouring massage, the treatment is best described as gymnastics for the face. The facial involves pinching and rolling the skin to stimulate circulation, plump up tissues, and contour and lift angles of the face and neck.\n\n\u2018The idea is that if you improve circulation, skin cells regenerate faster and one can look younger for longer,\u2019 explains Martine\u2019s son, Julien, who founded the London clinic. \u2018My grandmother used to do this pinching movement in her bathroom every morning and had the most amazing skin right up until she died at 104.\u2019\n\nRather than saturating the skin with endless products, it starts with just a simple cleansing wash and tonic, followed by Caudalie\u2019s Divine Oil, a dry grape seed oil that contains rejuvenating resveratrol, said to have anti-ageing benefits.\n\nFrance\u2019s first lady, Brigitte Macron, 66, (pictured) recently sparked the question if she has had cosmetic tweaks, after emerging from Cote d\u2019Azur looking remarkably refreshed\n\nThe massage then works upwards from the d\u00e9collet\u00e9, moving along the neck to the jawline, then vertically up the face, manipulating and softening the marionette lines on the sides of the mouth.\n\nThe therapist\u2019s hands work to ease facial tensions. Care is spent around the delicate eye area to drain and de-puff under-eye bags.\n\nLondon therapist Carol Yarde even dons a pair of rubber gloves to massage inside clients\u2019 mouths to plump out the lips and cheeks.\n\nAlthough the hour-long treatment feels fairly uncomfortable, the pay-off is impressive: one leaves with temporarily raised cheekbones, a firmer-looking jawline and megawatt glow.\n\nA course of five weekly treatments is recommended, from \u00a3160 each.\n\nINJECT INDIVIDUALITY\n\nNo one loves a needle more than the French but not for them the heavy-handed fillers for big lips and cheekbones that are so popular from Chelmsford to Cheshire.\n\n\u2018French women are looking to keep their own identity rather than change their look,\u2019 says Nelly Gauthier, one of Paris\u2019s most sought-after cosmetic doctors (docteurgauthier.fr/en), who has an A-list following.\n\nParisian girls come to see me from their 20s to soften lines. It is a little-and-often approach. They want to keep looking fresher for longer - Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh\n\n\u2018Individuality is key and we want to hang on to our powers of seduction and charm. With injectables, lips are a focal point but extreme sausage lips are few and far between. Women over 50 want to tweak the corners of lips upwards with filler rather than drastically plump out their lips, and even past the age of 60, standards never slip.\n\n\u2018I have a 93-year-old client who comes to fix the lines around her lips with light injections of hyaluronic acid. She tells me this is incredibly important as when she plays bridge with her friends she doesn\u2019t want her lipstick to smear.\u2019\n\nIn Britain, Dr Sylvie Bourr\u00e9e, who has clinics in Cannes and Paris, offers treatments in London at Michaeljohn salon (michaeljohn.co.uk) and specialises in subtle lip procedures. Her technique works on the projection of lips in a very natural way, injecting brands of filler including Juvederm and Surgiderm XP24 with a super-fine needle, drop by drop, to redefine the border of the lip.\n\nThis results in what she calls the \u2018gloss effect\u2019, as it gives the same kind of subtle plumping you get from a lip gloss (from \u00a3400).\n\nLaetitia Casta, 41 (pictured) has maintained an ageless appearance and has become known for her effortless style\n\nTRANSFORMATION TWEAKS\n\nIn France, enhancing the eye area is done in a similarly subtle manner. \u2018It is a little-and-often approach,\u2019 says Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh, who is largely credited with being the man who brought injectable treatments to the UK in 1992.\n\n\u2018Parisian girls start to come to see me in their mid-20s to soften their frown lines; they want small tweaks, an artistic approach, and are totally on board with the idea of Botox as a form of prevention that will keep them looking fresher for longer.\u2019\n\nTo tackle the often tricky area of under-eye fillers, he uses Teosyal Redensity II, a filler which he says seamlessly corrects tear troughs. \u2018This product is a more malleable hyaluronic acid filler, with a more liquid texture that volumises but also partially diffuses in the skin in the first two to three weeks.\n\n\u2018The benefit of this unique formula is you have a far more gentle plumping that won\u2019t swell and over-puff the delicate eye area with a telltale speed bump-style lumpiness or ball up into hard lumps.\u2019\n\nSkin doctor on speed dial \u2014 and it\u2019s free With around 20,000 dermatologists in Paris (compared to roughly 2,000 in the whole of the UK), caring for one\u2019s skin is engrained in the French DNA. \u2018In the UK teenagers go to Boots and buy drying products for issues such as acne and rosacea,\u2019 says Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh, who has clinics in Paris and London. \u2018Whereas in France our teens and children as young as ten are brought by their parents to see a dermatologist for any skin concern.\u2019 The price of treatment differs greatly too. \u2018A French dermatological consultation costs about 50 euros (\u00a344) and this can be refunded by social security,\u2019 says Dr Sebagh. In the UK, seeing a private dermatologist can carry a prohibitive \u00a3200-\u00a3300 price tag.\u2019 Top dermatologist Dr Helene du Menage, who has a clinic near Harley Street and is loved by the French expat community, focuses on skin health rather than injectable treatments. She covers medical dermatology, sun protection, skin cancer and skin care and often prescribes regimes with affordable, high-quality French pharmacy ranges. Sadly, her prices are more British than French, with consultations from \u00a3250 (020 7486 2554).\n\nSUBTLE SKIN SAVIOURS\n\nFor the forty-plus crowd, leading French surgeon Bernard Hayot, who is based in Paris, visits London every month to hold clinics at the Epilium & Skin clinic in Marylebone, London. He offers Derma Botox, shallow injections placed into the dermis, rather than the muscles of the forehead, to maintain movement for a more natural look.\n\nDr Hayot says: \u2018This technique also works well for people with oily skin as it helps to regulate sebum production so people don\u2019t look so shiny. It also helps to refine large pores as the Botox controls excess sebum production which, left unchecked, can clog up pores.\u2019\n\nSkin texture is a key concern for French women. \u2018They are more concerned about smoothing wrinkles and lines than erasing pigmentation,\u2019 says Dr Sebagh, \u2018as they are masters at camouflaging sun damage with make-up and don\u2019t have the patience for inflammatory laser treatments and hydroquinone lightening creams, which require staying away from the sun \u2014 hard to resist when we have the Cote d\u2019Azur.\u2019\n\nFrench women get their glow instead from mesotherapy treatments: multiple injections of vitamin-infused serums, delivered into the skin with a rapid-fire needle gun. Dr Sebagh\u2019s Meso Glow (\u00a3500 per treatment) has a cocktail of hyaluronic acid and antioxidants to deliver the ultimate dewy skin.\n\nLIFTING THE LEGS\n\n\u2018French millennials are not so consumed by Instagram as they are here in the UK,\u2019 says Dr Sebagh. \u2018For the French, a big Kardashian bum is a disaster. They still like the skinny, slightly androgynous look championed by Jane Birkin.\n\n\u2018To maintain their figures they don\u2019t snack but eat smaller meals, regularly paced throughout the day. They love to wear miniskirts and show off their legs and are very conscious about cellulite.\u2019\n\nParis therefore boasts a plethora of beauty treatments and creams for tackling cellulite and improving legs\u2019 appearance. Dr Jean-Marc Chardonneau visits London monthly to work at the Epilium & Skin clinic (epilium.co.uk). Specialising in treating veins, he also offers injectable treatments to target a range of problems from slimming down heavy legs to tightening up crepey thighs.\n\nWomen in Paris tend to focus on their d\u00e9collet\u00e9, signing up for Profhilo injections from their mid-to-late 30s (file image)\n\nThe secret is apparently organic silicium and DMAE, a compound that helps tighten skin and reduces sagging, administered in mesotherapy injections which target the fibroblasts of the skin to create new collagen and elastin.\n\nBut by far the most popular anti-cellulite treatment in France remains mesotherapy. For the legs it is cocktailed with diuretic and slimming ingredients such as caffeine, DMAE and L-carnitine, an amino acid, to speed up circulation, boost metabolism and help drain water retention.\n\nAt Dr Sebagh\u2019s London clinic he is now offering a new mesotherapy treatment injected into the backs of thighs and knees that uses Prostrolane Inner B, a peptide gel that increases lipolysis (the process in which fat cells are broken down) for targeted fat reduction.\n\nDECOLLETE AIRBRUSH\n\nWhereas in the UK the neck is a primary focus for many women, in Paris it is more about the d\u00e9collet\u00e9, with women in their mid- to late-30s signing up for Profhilo injections to ensure this area looks fresh and pretty.\n\nProfhilo is an injectable treatment that rehydrates and retextures crepey skin in a way no topical moisturiser could. It \u2018bio-remodels\u2019 the skin, stimulating collagen and elastin production in a process called Neocollagenesis. This triggers a patient\u2019s collagen receptors in the skin for a dewier skin texture.\n\nDr Jules Nabet, who splits his time between his clinics in St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, Paris, and the Omniya clinic in Knightsbridge, London, is a champion of Profhilo. He recommends two treatments paced one month apart (\u00a3350 per treatment).\n\nSurgeon Olivier de Frahan, is a master at using fat transfer to fill ageing faces in France and currently visits HB Health in London monthly (file image)\n\nSTEALTHY SURGERY\n\nOne of France\u2019s leading cosmetic surgeons, Eric Auclair (editorslist.co.uk), who visits London quarterly to see patients, says that when it comes to surgery French women want extremely natural results.\n\n\u2018They are very demanding and don\u2019t want any visible scars, which has forced French surgeons to come up with alternative solutions,\u2019 he explains.\n\n\u2018For breast augmentations, rather than make an incision under the fold of the breast, which leaves a scar that is visible, we place implants through small incisions in the armpit. Often we use smaller implants in combination with the patient\u2019s own fat.\u2019\n\nThis procedure is called fat transfer. The surgeon liposuctions fat from the patient\u2019s \u2018donor\u2019 fleshy areas around their stomach and thighs, then transfers it into areas where fat is needed.\n\nIn France, fat transfer is also hugely popular as a way to fill ageing faces. One of the masters of this technique is surgeon Olivier de Frahan, who visits HB Health (HBHealth.com) in Knightsbridge, London monthly (\u00a3100 for a consultation).\n\nHe uses fat transfer as the icing on the cake for his face and neck lifts, which start from \u00a312,000. For an additional \u00a31,000, he harvests and injects the fat to soften wrinkles and hollows around the eyes.\n\nDr Hayot, whose surgery specialises in facial rejuvenation, offers a procedure called additional blepharoplasty (from \u00a35,000) to rejuvenate upper and lower eyelids.\n\nAlready popular in France, this will be available at the Epilium & Skin clinic in London from the new year.\n\nUltimately, for the French, their cosmetic procedures are always about looking fresher rather than \u2018done\u2019. That\u2019s why the doctors are just as discreet as their patients.\n\nDr Hayot says: \u2018If anyone says, \u201cYou\u2019ve had a treatment with Dr Hayot,\u201d that would be a catastrophe for me.\u2019", "description": "Olivia Falcon who has edited cosmetic surgery guides for over 15 years, reveals the most coveted French practitioners operating in the UK.", "authors": ["Olivia Falcon For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/19/19662778-0-image-a-2_1570991067196.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
