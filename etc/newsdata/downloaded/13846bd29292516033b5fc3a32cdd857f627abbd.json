Sign up here.\n\nActress Felicity Huffman got out of federal prison Friday, just 11 days into a 14-day sentence for her role in the infamous college admissions bribery scandal that\u2019s swept up dozens of wealthy and famous parents.\n\nThe \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star reported to the minimum-security prison in Dublin, California, on Oct. 15 after she pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy related to paying to have her daughter\u2019s incorrect SAT answers fixed. It\u2019s standard for inmates to be released early if they\u2019re set to be released on a weekend, a prison official told NBC News.\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani also ordered last month that Huffman pay a $30,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. Now that she\u2019s out of prison, she\u2019ll undergo a year of supervised release.\n\nHer crimes were made public earlier this year when an FBI sting operation called \u201cOperation Varsity Blues\u201d revealed that Huffman and 51 other people schemed to get undeserving kids into elite universities through bribery and cheating. Huffman was the first parent to receive a prison sentence, and has claimed her daughter never knew she\u2019d paid the scheme\u2019s ringleader, Rick Singer, $15,000 to correct her test.\n\nSo far, 19 of the 35 parents charged in the scandal \u2014 including Huffman \u2014 have pleaded guilty to charges largely centering around fraud or money laundering. Eleven of the parents who have refused the plea, including actress Lori Loughlin, were hit with new federal bribery charges this week.\n\nMany of the parents who have pleaded guilty have received fairly modest sentences of a few weeks to a few months. Most recently, Jane Buckingham, a Beverly Hills businesswoman who helped rig her son\u2019s ACT score, was sentenced to three weeks in prison Wednesday, according to the Los Angeles Times. She paid Singer $35,000 to correct her son\u2019s answers, and is among the 11 parents who have been sentenced so far. Singer, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, fraud charges, and obstruction of justice.\n\nCover: Felicity Huffman leaves federal court after her sentencing in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal, Friday, Sept. 13, 2019, in Boston.
