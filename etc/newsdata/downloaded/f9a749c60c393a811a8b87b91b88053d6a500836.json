(AP) - An attorney for the Army Corps of Engineers is asking a judge to sign off on the Corps\u2019 conclusion that the Dakota Access oil pipeline doesn\u2019t harm American Indian tribes.\n\nThe Corps wants U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to rule in favor of its August 2018 finding that no more environmental study is needed on the $3.8 billion pipeline. The pipeline has been moving North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to Illinois for more than two years.\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux want the pipeline shut down and more study done. The tribe fears an oil spill could contaminate the Missouri River.\n\nThe Bismarck Tribune reports that a Justice Department attorney argues that the Corps \u201ccarefully and reasonably considered the environmental impacts\u201d before it permitted the pipeline.\n\nPipeline developer Texas-based Energy Transfer says the line is safe.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An attorney for the Army Corps of Engineers is asking a judge to sign off on the Corps' conclusion that the Dakota Access oil pipeline doesn't harm American Indian tribes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
