At present China employs limited resources which includes a small Russian S-300 system which considered only a modest deterrent against cruise and ballistic missiles.\n\nRussia's existing S-400 is claimed to be capable of intercepting ballistic missiles with a range of 3,500 km. That program was controversially sold to NATO-member Turkey this year, much to the displeasure of Washington.", "description": "The Russian president was speaking at annual Valdai Club meeting in Russia's Sochi.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102106832-492559195.jpg?v=1559326089", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
