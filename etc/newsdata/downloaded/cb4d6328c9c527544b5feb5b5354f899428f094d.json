Biden, said he regrets opening his father up to political attacks over his overseas business dealings but insisted that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nThe younger Biden said he doesn\u2019t specifically regret serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company \u2014 a situation that has become intertwined with House Democrats\u2019 newly formalized impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t regret being on the board,\u201d Hunter Biden said in an interview that aired Tuesday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d What I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,\u201d he said, while insisting he \u201cdid nothing wrong at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I make a mistake? Well, maybe, in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not,\u201d he said.\n\nThrough his attorney, Mr. Biden had said on Sunday that he would not serve on the boards of any foreign companies if his father is elected president.\n\nThe elder Mr. Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, had bragged last year about threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if Ukraine didn\u2019t fire a prosecutor who reportedly was eyeing the energy company, Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a lucrative position on the board of directors.\n\nThe comments marked Hunter Biden\u2019s first real public statement on the matter, as he has drawn the attention of Mr. Trump and Republicans in recent weeks and months.\n\nHouse Democrats are probing whether the president improperly pressured his Ukrainian counterpart into investigating the Bidens \u2014 a charge Mr. Trump denies.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
