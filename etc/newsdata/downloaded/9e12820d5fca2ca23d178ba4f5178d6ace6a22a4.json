And that concern ranked as the least of his worries.\n\nHe would soon start treatment for Stage 3c testicular cancer, where the cancer had spread to other parts of his body. The American Cancer Society lists the survival rate at 74%, and while not an insurmountable diagnosis, it\u2019s one that will scare even the toughest of individuals.\n\n\u201cI knew that night I was going into surgery in a day or two and I had an uphill climb ahead of me,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMy goal then was just being alive. Changing tires was very low on that list.\u201d\n\nDaniel Smith was with Kevin Harvick\u2019s pit crew until August lymph node surgery. The tire changer is back this weekend.

He did everything he could to make it back for the 2019 Daytona 500.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often that you see people getting injected with their chemo while they\u2019re doing their workout,\u201d Harvick said. \u201cThat\u2019s the type of guy that Daniel is. \u2026 He likes his job, but obviously his kids and his family are highly motivating to him.\u201d\n\nSmith has needed that motivation for more than a year. He did return for the 2019 Daytona 500 and worked for much of the regular season. But at Bristol in August, he found himself again on the sideline, this time after surgery to remove lymph nodes in his lower abdomen.\n\nTalladega Superspeedway hosts the fifth race of the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs.

He then developed a blood clot that delayed the surgery until August, forcing him to miss the last three races of the regular season and the first four of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series playoffs.\n\nHarvick will have Smith changing tires at Talladega Superspeedway as Smith makes another triumphant return this weekend.\n\n\u201cWe got all the aggressive stuff that would kill you in six months\u201d with the 2018 surgery, Smith said. \u201cBut if I didn\u2019t get those out and I just left them in there, those lymph nodes could potentially continue to grow and that teratoma would invade my other organs.\u201d\n\nWhen Harvick won at Indianapolis Motor Speedway last month without Smith, Harvick texted Smith the next day.\n\n\u201cEverybody is super supportive and he\u2019s super motivating for everybody because of how ambitious he is to work through all the things that he is going through and plan on coming back and changing a tire,\u201d Harvick said. \u201cHe\u2019s quite the human being.\u201d\n\nMany tire changers have a stand that they use to practice tightening and loosening lug nuts, but that wasn\u2019t enough for Smith during his rehabilitation from the initial surgery. SHR tire carrier Mike Morneau built a wheel hub, attached it to the back of a utility vehicle and brought a light tire to Smith so he could go through all of the motions.\n\nOPINION: Did failure to make NASCAR playoffs cost Stenhouse his ride?\n\nLARSON: Dover was a timely win in more ways than one\n\nTALLADEGA: Playoff race will pay tribute to Dale Earnhardt Sr.\n\nSmith would work changing tires a few times a week while going through treatments. He would do it Sunday mornings before a race and send film to his teammates.\n\n\u201cThat was huge for me just from a mental standpoint,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf I had not been hitting lug nuts that whole time, mentally it would have gotten me down more. It was nice to go out there and hit lugs. \u2026 It was therapeutic.\u201d\n\nDaniel Smith, left, with Stewart-Haas Racing tire carrier Mike Morneau.

When the Harvick team had the best time of any team on pit road at Atlanta Motor Speedway in the second race of the season, Smith knew he had returned to form.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I was like, \u2018All right, I can still do this. We\u2019re going to be all right,\u2019\u201d Smith said.\n\nMorneau, who along with Smith joined Haas CNC Racing (the precursor to SHR) in 2004, had few doubts Smith would return to perform at an elite level.\n\n\u201cOverall he\u2019s the same guy, the same tire changer, the same mentality of kicking everybody\u2019s ass has not changed,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been the guy that if he\u2019s going to do something, he\u2019ll do it. If he wants to beat you at golf, he\u2019s the guy that will beat you.\u201d\n\nQuitting wasn\u2019t an option.\n\n\u201cIt never crossed my mind,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhat else am I going to do, though? Every other job is going to be boring.\u201d\n\nBob Pockrass is a Fox Sports NASCAR reporter.
