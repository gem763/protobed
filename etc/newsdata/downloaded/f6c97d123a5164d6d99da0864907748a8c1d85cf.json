He\u2019s loud, he\u2019s brash, and he\u2019s got an uncanny ability to spark outrage and controversy just by opening his mouth. His is a reality-show candidacy for a reality-show age, and his pitch to voters fits it to a tee: heavy on personality and light on policy. Those stances he does take have a superficial populist appeal \u2014 quite a substantial one if the polls are to be believed \u2014 but tend to fall apart on closer inspection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCase in point: American policy in the Middle East, where Trump has in recent years repeatedly endorsed the bizarre, bellicose fantasy that the U.S. could and should seize oil fields in Iraq and Libya.\n\nIn 2007, Trump said that the U.S. should \u201cdeclare victory and leave\u201d Iraq, \u201cbecause I\u2019ll tell you, this country is just going to get further bogged down.\u201d Four years later, as Obama prepared to withdraw U.S. troops from the country, Trump was more or less getting his wish. But by then he appeared to be arguing that the U.S. should maintain its troop presence simply to seize Iraqi oil fields.\n\n\u201cSo you would keep troops in Iraq after this year?\u201d asked Wall Street Journal reporter Kelly Evans.\n\n\u201cI would take the oil,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nTrump has repeatedly endorsed the bizarre, bellicose fantasy that the U.S. could and should seize oil fields in Iraq and Libya.\n\nA confused Evans responded, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you would take \u2014 does that mean keeping troops there, or staying involved in Iraq?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou heard me, I would take the oil,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cI would not leave Iraq and let Iran take the oil.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout a week after his interview with Evans, Trump elaborated, suggesting that America\u2019s losses in Iraq deserved compensation in the form of Iraqi oil. \u201cIn the old days, you know when you had a war, to the victor belong the spoils,\u201d he told George Stephanopoulos in 2011. \u201cYou go in. You win the war and you take it. . . . You\u2019re not stealing anything. . . . We\u2019re taking back $1.5 trillion to reimburse ourselves.\u201d\n\nA few days after his interview with Stephanopolous, he suggested that U.S. policy toward the uprising against Moammar Qaddafi in Libya should also focus on \u201ctaking the oil.\u201d\n\nRELATED: What\u2019s Behind the Trump Bump\n\n\u201cI would go in and take the oil \u2014 I would just go in and take the oil,\u201d Trump told Greta Van Susteren. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who the rebels are, we hear they come from Iran, we hear they\u2019re influenced by Iran or al-Qaeda, and, frankly I would go in, I would take the oil \u2014 and stop this baby stuff.\u201d He would later say, \u201cI\u2019m only interested in Libya if we take the oil. If we don\u2019t take the oil, I\u2019m not interested.\u201d\n\nAt CPAC 2013, Trump said he\u2019d been told that seizing the oil fields had been an original goal of the Bush administration, now mysteriously forgotten.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that we were first going into Iraq, some very smart people told me \u2018well, we\u2019re actually going for the oil,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Alright, I get that, there\u2019s nothing else, I get it. We didn\u2019t take the oil! And when I said, we spent $1.5 trillion we should take it and pay ourselves back. What are we doing? What the hell are we thinking?\u201d\n\nGet Free Exclusive NR Content\n\nTrump added that the U.S. government should use the seized $1.5 trillion to provide a million dollars to the family of every slain U.S. solder. \u201cA million dollars to a family is nothing compared to the kind of wealth that you\u2019re talking about over there.\u201d The U.S. suffered 4,492 military fatalities in Iraq; that amounts to $4.5 billion under Trump\u2019s plan.\n\nTo this day, Trump sees the oil fields as the fulcrum of power in the Middle East. After being prompted by Anderson Cooper to elaborate on his plan to deal with the terrorist group ISIS, Trump declared, \u201cI would bomb the hell out of those oil fields. I wouldn\u2019t send many troops because you won\u2019t need them by the time I\u2019m finished.\u201d\n\nThe man who wrote The Art of the Deal offers Americans a vision of a world where national security policy is simple, with lots of benefits and little cost.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how Trump\u2019s policy would differ from existing U.S. strategy, which managed to reduce ISIS\u2019 ability to produce oil from 70,000 barrels a day to about 20,000 within one month. (Immobile, heavy-equipment dominated sites like oil derricks and refineries are perhaps the easiest bombing targets.)\n\nEarlier this year, an international review of known information about ISIS\u2019 finances concluded the group\u2019s \u201cearnings from oil-related trade have probably diminished in importance relative to other sources of revenue due to coalition airstrikes\u201d as well as the group\u2019s need for refined crude for its military operations and declining oil prices. The report added, \u201cAs a result of coalition airstrikes, ISIL has been forced to rely upon even more primitive refining techniques, including burning the crude in open pits that produce limited yields of poor-quality product.\u201dIn his \u201ctake the oil fields\u201d comments over the years, Trump never quite elaborated on details like who would operate the drilling equipment and refineries in those foreign countries, and how the locals would respond to their national property and territory being seized. Nor does he worry about the Geneva Convention\u2019s explicit ban on seizing property from an adversary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRELATED: Donald Trump and the Republican Party\u2019s \u2018Mad as Hell\u2019 Moment\n\nThe man who wrote The Art of the Deal offers Americans a vision of a world where national security policy is simple, with lots of benefits and little cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#related#When the Iraq War is going badly, the United States can declare victory and leave; if need be, we can go back in and \u201ctake the oil\u201d later. It\u2019s a soothing fiction, like the idea of getting the Mexican government to pay for a new border fence, or the idea that high oil prices can be solved by \u201clook[ing OPEC] in the eye and say[ing], \u2018Fellas, you\u2019ve had your fun, the fun is over\u201d or that the U.S. can stop China\u2019s currency manipulation by \u201chaving a very, very strong talk with the president of China.\u201d\n\nA man who built a real estate empire on brinksmanship proposes a correction for voters who feel like foreign powers bully their country on a regular basis. The appeal is obvious, but so is the unlikelihood that Trump\u2019s shifting, temperamental geopolitical approach would survive a collision with reality.\n\n\u2014 Jim Geraghty is the senior political correspondent for National Review.", "description": "Trump has in recent years repeatedly endorsed the bizarre, bellicose fantasy that the U.S. could and should seize oil fields in Iraq and Libya.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Andrew C.
