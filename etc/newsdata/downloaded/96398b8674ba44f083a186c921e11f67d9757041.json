He won't be president but he deserves attention.", "language": "en", "text": "No, seriously. Stop laughing, at least for a couple of minutes.\n\nI know, I know: Andrew Yang is not going to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2020.\n\nHe knows that, too.\n\nYang somehow made the cut to participate in last week's third Democratic debate, clearing the fundraising and polling thresholds the party established in an effort to winnow its presidential field. But he did little to persuade viewers who remained alert throughout that three-hour marathon that he will be a factor in the primaries to come.\n\nSo I'm not writing this to suggest that the political oddsmakers should be taking Yang's dark-horse candidacy more seriously, or that Yang would be getting more respect if the average Democratic voter were as far-sighted as he is.\n\nAutomating away millions of jobs\n\nI simply want to acknowledge that he is the only candidate talking about an issue that seems likely to loom larger in presidential campaigns to come, and suggest that critics who scoff at his signature proposal for a universal basic income may feel compelled to examine it more closely in the decade ahead \u2014 especially if Yang's forecast of an artificial intelligence-induced tsunami of unemployment prove prescient.\n\nI find Yang's candidacy interesting not because of his unusual resume, which includes no prior political experience, but because he has offered what might be the simplest and most useful explanation of how Donald Trump came to be president.\n\nThe conventional wisdom, as Yang summarizes it, is that Trump's ascent was the perfect storm spawned by the convergence of racism, Russian cyber-kibitzing, and hostility toward Hillary Clinton.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang at the Democratic debate in Houston on Sept. 12, 2019. More\n\nHis own explanation is simpler.\n\n\"I'm a numbers guy,\" Yang said in a recent broadcast of the New York Times' \"The Daily\" podcast, \"and the numbers tell a very clear and distinct story: that the reason why he's our president is that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan \u2014 all the swing states you needed to win.\"\n\nAn unemployment crisis is coming\n\nAs Yang sees it sees it, that dramatic decline in manufacturing jobs represents only the prelude to a coming unemployment crisis that will leave tens of millions of Americans currently working in a much broader swath of industries without jobs by the end of the next decade.\n\nMy son, a hard-working entrepreneur with only a marginal interest in politics but a keen eye for the zeitgeist, likes to warn me that America's next bloody revolution will come when autonomous vehicles begin supplanting the nation's 3.5 million truck drivers, whose livelihood is the most common occupation in more than half of the 50 states.\n\nDebate flub fest: When will Democrats start judging Joe Biden by his actual words?\n\nYang agrees. \"The replacement of drivers will be one of the most dramatic, visible battlegrounds between automation and the human worker,\" he writes in a recent essay for the Evonomics website. \"Companies can eliminate the jobs of call center workers, retail clerks, fast food workers and the like with minimal violence and fuss. Truck drivers will be different.\"\n\nIf you know anything at all about Yang's quixotic candidacy, it's probably that he proposes to address that crisis by using the proceeds of a value-added tax on corporate profits to bankroll a $1,000-a-month \"freedom-dividend\" for every American adult.\n\nFreedom dividend and harnessing love\n\nThe freedom dividend \u2014 Yang concedes that he adopted that descriptor because it went down easier with voters than its predecessor \"universal basic income payments\" \u2014 is being taken about as seriously as fellow dark-horse Marianne Williamson's proposal to \"harness love\" in her campaign to bring about a spiritual transformation of American government.", "description": "He may have the best explanation for how the Trump presidency happened: We 'automated away' 4 million manufacturing jobs in presidential swing states.", "authors": ["Brian Dickerson", "Detroit Free Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eLPsmQSrYVVJkuc2L3Pgdw--~B/aD0xNjU4O3c9MjI1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_opinion_532/567eaaea96a7ce7996d340d5dbfdbe26", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
