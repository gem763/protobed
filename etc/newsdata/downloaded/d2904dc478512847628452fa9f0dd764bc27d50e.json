Giuliani spent months cultivating current and former prosecutors in Ukraine with a particular goal: Help President Trump in next year\u2019s election by ensuring that Ukrainian authorities pursued allegations that could damage his Democratic rivals.\n\nBut the effort hit a snag. Political neophyte and comedian Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 who once played a Ukrainian president on a television sitcom \u2014 swooped in last spring and became the president of Ukraine for real. Some of Giuliani\u2019s efforts were thrown in doubt. One of the prosecutors Giuliani initially saw as an ally made public comments undermining his claims against former vice president Joe Biden. How Zelensky would act was unknown.\n\n\u201cNew Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden bribery of Pres Poroshenko,\u201d Giuliani tweeted on June 21, without evidence of the allegations, referring to the former president, Petro Poroshenko, whom Zelensky defeated. \u201cTime for leadership and investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Obama people.\u201d\n\nThe frustration helps explain why Trump, ahead of a July 25 phone call that is now the subject of a whistleblower complaint and a congressional impeachment inquiry, turned up the heat.\n\nFacing doubt about Zelensky\u2019s willingness to work with Giuliani, Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine on July 18. Days later, Zelensky\u2019s party swept Ukraine\u2019s parliamentary elections, ushering in political newcomers and upping the uncertainty about whether Giuliani\u2019s efforts would come undone.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump was withholding a date for a coveted bilateral summit with Zelensky. A congratulatory call with the comedian landed on the books \u2014 a chance for Trump to make his wishes clear.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump said after Zelensky raised the matter of military aid, according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.\n\nTrump told the Ukrainian leader that he should coordinate with Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr in investigating the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email server, which Trump suggested was in Ukraine, and probe the activities of Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.\n\nThe sequence of events is at the heart of an extraordinary whistleblower complaint from an unnamed U.S. intelligence official released Thursday, which warns that Trump was using the power of his office to solicit interference in the 2020 election from Ukraine. Giuliani\u2019s in-person meetings and secretive sessions form a key component of what the whistleblower saw as \u201ca serious or flagrant problem, abuse or violation of law or Executive Order.\u201d\n\nGiuliani decried any scrutiny of his conduct in a long interview Thursday, saying that more attention was finally being paid to the Biden family.\n\n\u201cThese crooks can go after me all they want,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to find anything.\u201d\n\nA bevy of prosecutors\n\nIn interviews with The Washington Post, Giuliani said that, in his capacity as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, he had met with five current and former Ukrainian prosecutors since last year. During those meetings, he said, he obtained information about Hunter Biden and what the former New York mayor has alleged was collusion between Democrats and Ukraine in the 2016 election.\n\nGiuliani and a Ukrainian American businessman who was working with him, Lev Parnas, said those meetings included a Skype phone call last year with former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, whom Joe Biden had urged be fired. Giuliani then met with then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko in New York in January and again in Warsaw in February.\n\nBy May, Giuliani planned to visit Kiev to meet with the newly elected Zelensky. After the New York Times revealed his plan, the former mayor canceled his trip but said he met in Paris with more prosecutors, including Nazar Kholodnytsky, head of Ukraine\u2019s Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office. So many Ukrainian prosecutors had to be consulted because they often disagreed with one another, Giuliani said, adding that some of them are \u201cinept.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to separate all the different ones,\u201d he said.\n\nSome of the Ukrainians Giuliani and his associates interacted with were banned from entering the United States. Giuliani blamed the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine for blocking the officials from coming to the United States to give him more information.\n\nParnas described an atmosphere in which Ukrainian prosecutors were rushing to Giuliani with information, often also pursuing their own personal and political agendas. He described the officials as \u201chitting on every door to try and get their information here.\u201d\n\nA former Ukrainian prosecutor said he believed the officials were angling to provide Giuliani with compromising information at least partly to advance their own careers \u2014 and win U.S. backing for their position within the often rough-and-tumble world of Ukrainian politics.\n\n\u201cThey needed direct access to the U.S. president to convince him that they are the right group to represent Ukraine,\u201d the former prosecutor said, speaking on the condition on anonymity to discuss his private impressions of the group\u2019s motivations. \u201cThey understood the best method to come closer to Trump is to bring something that contains information that is a real interest to U.S. politics.\u201d\n\nWho contacted whom in each case, and how, is not entirely clear.\n\n\n\nGiuliani and Parnas suggested that the prosecutors came to them. Lutsenko, however, in an interview with The Post on Thursday, said Giuliani contacted him via another prosecutor, whom the Ukrainian politician declined to name.\n\nIn an interview in his heavily guarded office in Kiev, Kholodnytsky said that his conversation with Giuliani in Paris was like that between two prosecutors. The Ukrainian official voiced his suspicions about investigations into Burisma, the energy company on whose board Hunter Biden sat for five years, and about the summer 2016 appearance in Ukraine of a black ledger tallying payments to Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, that forced him out of his post.\n\n\u201cThe conversation was generally about corruption in Ukraine,\u201d Kholodnytsky said. \u201cI had a personal conversation. I told him that something wasn\u2019t right there.\u201d\n\nGiuliani \u201cdidn\u2019t react,\u201d Kholodnytsky said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t jump with balloons.\u201d\n\nChanging stories\n\nAmong the bevy of prosecutors, perhaps none was more important than Yuri Lutsenko, who served as Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor under Poroshenko from May 2016 until Aug. 29 of this year.\n\nLutsenko was always an unconventional pick for the post. Although he served twice as interior minister after the 2004 Orange Revolution, he was not a lawyer, a typical qualification for a job comparable to attorney general in the United States.\n\nWhen he took office in 2016, diplomats and pro-Western activists were hopeful that he could sweep through the corruption-plagued prosecutor general\u2019s office and shake up the system. Biden had just helped to push out his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, amid a widespread perception in Ukraine and among its Western backers that he was perpetuating old, corruption-prone habits.\n\nBut hopes placed in Lutsenko were quickly dashed. He clashed with a more independent anti-corruption bureau set up in the aftermath of a 2014 pro-Europe uprising. He also ended up in a vicious battle with U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who pushed him to stop pressuring the bureau. She called for Kholodnytsky\u2019s ouster after the bureau allegedly caught him on tape advising suspects in corruption cases on how to avoid prosecution \u2014 a bold intervention on her part.\n\nBy the time he met Giuliani, Lutsenko was fed up with Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who was appointed in the final year of the Obama administration. He was nervous about his future as Ukrainian presidential elections drew closer. And he saw a chance to deliver a blow to the rival anti-corruption bureau that he viewed as a dangerous actor with loyalties more to the United States than to Ukraine.\n\nInitially, Lutsenko appeared to help in Giuliani\u2019s pursuit.\n\nHe stirred up perceptions that Joe Biden had intervened into Ukraine\u2019s justice system to quash an investigation into the gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board, meeting repeatedly with Giuliani and telling a conservative columnist at the Hill newspaper that he \u201cwould be happy\u201d to talk to Barr about the issue.\n\nBut when Poroshenko, his boss and political ally, lost in the spring election, the top prosecutor dialed back certain comments.\n\nFirst, in May, he said in an interview with Bloomberg News that \u201cat least as of now,\u201d he didn\u2019t believe that the Bidens had broken any Ukrainian laws.\n\nThen on Thursday, he declared to The Post that \u201con the territory of Ukraine, Hunter Biden did not violate Ukrainian legislation.\u201d\n\nGiuliani was livid. \u201cHe flipped because he was trying to protect Poroshenko,\u201d he said in an interview Thursday.\n\n'Bad news'\n\nGiuliani wanted to go through every point that could potentially boost Trump\u2019s reelection effort, the former top prosecutor recalled.\n\n\u201cHe had a lot of files and documents on the table. I was not the first person he had met with about the case,\u201d Lutsenko said.\n\nOne of Giuliani\u2019s main allegations is that Joe Biden pushed for Shokin\u2019s dismissal because the prosecutor was investigating the owner of the gas company where Hunter Biden was on the board. The U.S. ambassador at the time, however, had publicly pressured Shokin to pursue the owner, singling out the prosecutor\u2019s apparent shelving of the case as an example of his failures.\n\nFor Lutsenko, discussions with Giuliani were a chance to take aim at Yovanovitch, who had a brass-knuckled approach to tackling the institutions and individuals she saw as keeping Ukraine stuck in a mire of corruption.\n\nGiuliani also wanted her fired. \u201cHer embassy was keeping five different people from giving us information,\u201d he said.\n\nHer blunt style led to clashes. But other Western diplomats in Kiev said her approach was fairly common for U.S. envoys in any country that depends heavily on U.S. aid.\n\nLutsenko said he confided his worries about the ambassador to Giuliani. In an article in the Hill, Lutsenko claimed the ambassador gave him a \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list \u2014 an allegation that the State Department denied. The story got play on Fox News and was mentioned by both Trump and his eldest son in tweets, building pressure that led to the State Department ending Yovanovitch\u2019s tour early. Lutsenko, in an April interview with the Ukrainian publication the Babel, admitted she did not give him a list. Speaking to The Post, he maintained she wanted certain people to be untouchable.\n\nYovanovitch declined to comment.\n\nIn his call with Zelensky, Trump called her \u201cbad news.\u201d Zelensky said he agreed \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\nTrump added: \u201cWell, she\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nBirnbaum reported from Kiev.
