Wayne wrote: 'Since supporting @NSPCC_official and @Childline_official over the last 4 years I have seen things get better when it comes to talking about our mental health but there is still lots of work to be done.'\n\n'I really want to urge anyone who follows me who might be going through a struggle to seek support and talk about how they\u2019re feeling, not just today but any day. #WMHD.'\n\nSnap decision: The man who shared the video also uploaded also posed for a selfie with Wayne\n\nPic: The father-of-five also posed for a snapshot with the club's owner Anoosh Gryphon Heist\n\nHours earlier Jamie threw his support behind beleaguered wife Rebekah.\n\nThe Leicester City striker has maintained a stoic social media silence following Coleen\u2019s extraordinary claim that his wife has sold stories about her to a national news outlet.\n\nBut after Rebekah furiously denied the allegation in a lengthy Twitter statement, he joined more than 7,000 followers in liking her post.\n\nJamie and Rebekah, who is heavily pregnant with her fifth child, were taking advantage of the international football break by holidaying in Dubai when Coleen made her accusation on Wednesday morning.\n\nBreaking his silence: Last week, the footballer posted to social media amid his wife Coleen Rooney's ongoing war of words with fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy\n\nSupportive: Jamie Vardy meanwhile has thrown his support behind beleaguered wife Rebekah as her ongoing war of words with Coleen Rooney continues\n\nAnd Jamie was seen comforting his distraught wife in their lavish five-star hotel shortly after the news broke.\n\nA source told MailOnline: \u2018They were seen together in the Four Seasons Dubai restaurant last night. Rebekah seemed to be tearful and Jamie looked like he was comforting her.\u2019\n\nThe wife of former England captain Wayne Rooney took to Instagram and Twitter to 'expose' Rebekah for allegedly taking stories from her private social media accounts and selling them to them to The Sun.\n\nShe wrote: 'For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\nBy her side: Jamie liked his wife's lengthy Twitter denial after she refuted Coleen Rooney's claim that she has sold stories about her to a national news outlet\n\nAllegation: Coleen (pictured on Wednesday morning) claims Rebekah sold stories about her personal life to The Sun\n\n'There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n'To try and prove this, I came up with an idea, I blocked everyone from viewing Instagram except ONE account. '\n\nShe continued: '(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while). Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\nThe full statement: Coleen made these claims on Instagram after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her, concluding that it was Rebekah\n\nWag-atha Christie: Coleen tweeted these words back in January, highlighting how she has been trying to get to the bottom of who was leaking stories on her life for some time\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nShe also wrote: 'This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it......'\n\nThe Sun has since removed their story about Coleen's basement flooding after discovering she had made it up.\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation - she also slammed her for going public when she is heavily pregnant\n\nShocking: Rebekah has since hit out at trolls after being bombarded with vile messages on social media\n\nRebekah hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations. She wrote: 'Can't believe I'm even having to write this. I'm pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this.\n\n'I'm now having to take legal advice as I can't deal with this stress myself when I'm this pregnant. I'm now having to take legal advice as I can't deal with this stress myself when I'm this pregnant.'\n\nShe also shared: 'As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.'\n\nHer spokesperson also told MailOnline: 'Please refer to Becky\u2019s social media posts.\n\nStepping out: Coleen emerged on Thursday morning, the day after making her allegation\n\nDistraught: The heavily pregnant WAG is cutting short her family holiday in Dubai and flying home with husband Jamie after being left 'devastated and inconsolable' over her fallout with Coleen Rooney (pictured in Dubai last month)\n\nFormer friends: Coleen and Rebekah grew close through their respective husbands' association with the England national team, with the pair travelling to France for England's participation in Euro 2016 (pictured)\n\nThe FAKE stories Coleen shared which were sold to The Sun and followed by media outlets Wayne and Coleen Rooney's \u00a320m 'Morrisons' manor is 'flooded On Tuesday, it was claimed that the Rooney's basement had flooded due to Storm Lorenzo. It was said to have caused a 'massively stressful' setback in the completion of the sprawling three-storey mansion Coleen Rooney 'is so desperate for a baby girl that she's looked into controversial \u00a38K gender selection treatment' The Sun first reported that mother of four sons, Coleen had looked into 'gender selection' treatment in a desperate bid for a daughter and had flown to Mexico earlier this year to discuss the controversial \u00a38,000 treatment with doctors Coleen Rooney 'hopes to revive her TV career including a Strictly stint now she's moved back to the UK' after husband Wayne's scandal The Sun wrote that she was in talks to revive her once successful UK TV career now her family has moved back to this side of the Atlantic. The mother-of-four apparently had to decline the offer to appear on this year's Strictly Come Dancing but could compete in 2020\n\n'It isn\u2019t true, she is now very upset and stressed so has passed it to her legal team to deal with. Such a shame that Coleen didn\u2019t just call her when she had her number.'\n\nRebekah has since slammed trolls who have wished her unborn baby would die in the wake of her Coleen Rooney story leaking scandal.\n\nTaking to Instagram on Wednesday evening, the WAG, 37, shared a screenshot of an Instagram message sent to her by a follower who penned: 'F**k u dirty sly c**t I hope that baby dies within you B***H'.\n\nShe is understood to have ended her family holiday in the Emirates and flown back to the United Kingdom in a bid to prove her innocence.\n\nSources close to the WAG say she is preparing to hit back and is working with her lawyers to prove she had nothing to do with the leak.\n\nAn insider exclusively told MailOnline: 'Rebekah has been incredibly stressed and hasn\u2019t stopped sobbing all day, which is very out of character for her.\n\n'The whole situation has left her distraught and she still doesn\u2019t understand why Coleen didn\u2019t reach out to her first to ask her outright about the issue.\n\n'She\u2019s flying home early from Dubai as she feels her time abroad has been spoilt and all she wants is to be surrounded by family.\n\n'Rebekah wants to prove she had nothing to do with the leaked stories and is working with a lawyer and IT experts who can look at the forensics of her Instagram, which several people have access to.'\n\nClose friends only: This is believed to be Coleen's private account - which is separate to the one she shares with the public\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for Coleen said: 'It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.'\n\nOn Thursday morning former WAG Lizzie Cundy told Channel 5 news that Coleen wouldn't have pointed the finger if she had any doubt.\n\nTalking from her home, Lizzie told broadcaster Claudia-Liza Armah about her friendship with both Coleen and Rebekah and said: 'Well, like everyone else, I am in total shock.\n\n'Coleen has been doing her detective work for a couple of years now. I know these stories about her have been repeatedly coming out in the press.\n\nDumbfounded: On Thursday morning former WAG Lizzie Cundy told Channel 5 news that Coleen wouldn't have pointed the finger if she had any doubt\n\nThe flip side: Host Claudia-Liza Armah made it clear that Vardy has denied the accusations and that other people do have access to her Instagram account\n\nLizzie said: 'I know Coleen and I am friends with both. Coleen is very intelligent, very bright. I don't think she is given enough credit for that'\n\n'She really wanted to get to the bottom of it and she did. I know Coleen and I am friends with both. Coleen is very intelligent, very bright. I don't think she is given enough credit for that.\n\n'She is determined and wanted to know who is releasing these stories. Whether it's right to out someone in the way she did is another question, but it was really upsetting her and upsetting her family life.'\n\nLizzie said she admires the way Coleen found out the truth.\n\nShe said: 'She wanted to get to the bottom of it. It was a clever way to do it. I am one of the followers who follow her on her private Instagram.\n\nPals: Lizzie, who knows Rebekah well, said she still can't believe this is something she would do\n\n'And I did wonder what was going on as she had been very quiet. I've got such a busy life and I didn't see anything coming up - but I would have a flick through.'\n\nLizzie, who knows Rebekah well, said she still can't believe this is something she would do.\n\nShe said: 'I can't believe she would do this. What are the reasons? She doesn't need the money. She has got a wonderful lifetyle, a wonderful family. It just beggars belief.'\n\nClaudia made clear that Vardy has denied the accusations and that other people do have access to her Instagram account.\n\nTaking sides: A host of celebrities leapt to Coleen's defence and said they felt sorry for her\n\nShe asked Lizzie what Rebekah is really like and she replied: 'I love her. We were at the National Television Awards together. We have great fun.\n\n'She doesn't need the money, she doesn't need the fame. The only other reason is possibly to keep in with journalists and press by giving these stories.\n\n'I have to say, for Coleen to do this, she must have had concrete evidence, because there is no way she would put this on social media knowing it's going out to the world.\n\n'She wouldn't do this unless she knew 100%. Really, I just can't believe that Becky would do this. Coleen really feel she has done it.'\n\nClaudia added: 'Rebekah also follows two of the journalists who reportedly posted these stories.'\n\nLizzie replied: 'Well yeah she does. But she is in the public eye. There are a lot of journalists who follow me and I follow them.\n\nAwkward: In 2017, Rebekah's ex-partner and father of one of her children, Luke Foster discussed her relentless quest for fame when he gave an interview with The Mirror , saying at the time: 'I'm glad I am shot of her'\n\nHousehold name: In 2017, she appeared on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! but was the third person to be voted off. Foster claims her decision to appear on the show was motivated by a desire to be famous\n\n'I do a radio show with one of the top journalists in the country. It's part of our work. It doesn't mean she's guilty.'\n\nIn the midst of the controversy a host of celebrities took to social media to air their views on the matter - and most appeared to be taking Coleen's side.\n\nFellow former WAG Danielle Lloyd posted some rat emojis in the comments section of Coleen's post and even Wayne Rooney prostitute Helen Wood leaped to Coleen's defence.\n\nShe wrote: 'Probably shouldn\u2019t comment but going to anyway always said Rebekah Vardy was a snake in the grass hence why I\u2019m blocked her whole persona screamed it on the jungle. Sly eyes too.'\n\nShe also retweeted a post from Vardy from a fan who wrote: 'Rebekah Vardy really embarrassing herself with that reply to Coleen Rooney.'\n\nControversy: Some viewers called for her to leave the show after some of her homophobic tweets were unearthed\n\nTV star Richard Osman wrote: 'I will vote for any political party who agree to immediately give us the rest of the day off so we can follow this Coleen Rooney/Rebekah Vardy thing properly.'\n\nRebekah and Jamie tied the knot at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire on May 25, 2016 and sold the rights to their wedding to Hello!\n\nShe has appeared regularly on Loose Women and This Morning as well as Good Morning Britain - she has had stints on Jeremy Vine's show and Celebrity Gogglebox.\n\nIn 2017, Rebekah appeared on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! but was the third person to be voted off.\n\nSome viewers called for her to leave the show after some of her homophobic tweets were unearthed\n\nNot a nice thing to do: Rebekah previously had a one-night stand with singer Peter Andre in 2001 and has spoken about their relationship in the press, leaking a story to the News Of The World, saying he had a 'chipolata penis\n\nThe tweets in question said: '@MrHarryWood: @Xelahopkins1984 @Little_Miss_Foz what about the 3rd \u201cbird\u201d the gay walker? @jay_walker25 ginger gay w**ker ha ha PMSL.'\n\nWhile, to the bystander, this tweet mostly doesn't make sense, the words 'gay' and 'ginger gay w**ker' caught the eye of her critics, demanding she be taken off the show.\n\nHowever her friend Jay Walker, who was mentioned in the tweets, stepped in to clear things up.\n\n'I hate to disappoint people '[but] this tweet was to me & we were all just repeating names a guy had called us.\n\n'Nothing homophobic about it & actually mocking someone who had been. Rebekah is the least homophobic or malicious person I know so afraid your all very much mistaken. Good luck Mrs Vardy.'\n\nTeen wedding bells; Rebekah wed Mark Godden in a \u00a37,000 ceremony when she was just 19; when she appeared on I'm a Celebrity in 2017, her former husband, who she was married to for just six months, said he hoped she would 'go through hell' during the reality show\n\nShe also headed out to Russia with the family to support husband Jamie in the 2018 World Cup.\n\nRebekah previously had a one-night stand with singer Peter Andre in 2001 and has previously spoken about their relationship in the press, saying he had a 'chipolata penis.'\n\nShe gave an interview to The News Of The World about the fling, saying Peter was 'the worst lover' she'd ever had.\n\nAdding: 'He had great muscles and I thought he'd be a great lover. But he was the worst lover I have ever had. He didn't even attempt to satisfy me!'\n\nRebekah, 'Becky' to close friends, was first married to Mark Godden after a whirlwind romance when he was 21-years-old and she was just 18.\n\nWags at war: The WAG, currently heavily pregnant with her fifth child, was named by Coleen as the frenemy responsible for selling stories about her\n\nHapp couple: Rebekah and Jamie married in 2016 at luxurious Peckforton Castle in Cheshire although many of Jamie's close family didn't attend the nuptials, with Rebekah blamed for causing a rift between Jamie and his mother Lisa and stepfather Phil\n\nThey met at his local pub in Witney where she was a barmaid and he was playing in the darts team.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror in 2017, he claimed they became engaged when Becky Nicholson, as she was then called, spotted a ring in a magazine and told him: 'I want that. Buy it for me.'\n\nIt's reported the pair spent \u00a37000 on their wedding on the beach in Mexico in 2001, but the union lasted just six months.\n\nSpeaking of his ex after seeing her appear on I'm A Celebrity, Mark told the Sun: 'I'm an avid fan [of the show] and this year it's even better because my ex is on it. While I don't want to see her win, although she'd love to, I want her to go through hell.'\n\nClose: Meanwhile Coleen is extremely close to her parents, Colette and Tony, and has called her mother her 'best friend' in the past\n\nBecky then went on to date Steve Clarke, her boss at a timeshare company, and during their on-off relationship, she fell pregnant by another man.\n\nAged 23 and eight months pregnant with her daughter Megan, she eventually tied the knot with Steve, which she's since described as the 'biggest mistake of her life'.\n\nThey soon moved to Cyprus and the marriage broke down after 10 months, when Steve allegedly cheated on her.\n\nBecky fled back to the UK with Meghan and weeks later, Clarke was sentenced to two years in prison after being convicted of causing death by reckless driving in a head-on crash which killed a father and grandfather.\n\nHer next significant relationship was with ex-lower league footballer Luke Foster, father of her son player who she met in 2007 when he was playing for Conference side Oxford United.\n\nSiblings: The star also has a strong bond with her two brothers, Joe and Anthony McLoughlin, with Coleen being best friends with Joe's partner Amy Wilkinson and Anthony's girlfriend Carley Smith (pictured together with her children and parents)\n\nIn 2017, Foster discussed her relentless quest for fame when he gave an interview with The Mirror, saying at the time: 'I'm glad I am shot of her.'\n\nHe claimed she told him shew had 'upgraded' him by dating Jamie, who was then earning \u00a380k per week as a Leicester player.\n\nFoster met Rebekah in 2007 - she already had daughter Megan and the couple had son Taylor, nine, together. He claimed her decision to appear on I'm A Celebrity was motivated by a desire to be more famous, not wealthier.\n\nThe ex lower-league footballer said: 'For Becky, going on the show is not about money. This is all about becoming famous. If someone had a better car than us, she'd want to go one better.\n\n'She's now got the husband she always wanted, one who can keep her in the lifestyle she's dreamt of. She's got the shopping, the house, the car. She's living her perfect life.\n\nShock: Moreover, Wayne and Rebekah's footballer husband Jamie are also close friends, having both represented England - but it was previously claimed that Wayne had warned Jamie about his wife\n\n'Becky upgraded. She said that to my face. She said he'd treat her a hell of a lot better.'\n\nThe couple split in 2013 and three months later Becky and Jamie were expecting their first child together - she is now expecting her third child with the footballer.\n\nIt was previously claimed that Coleen's husband had 'warned' Jamie about Rebekah in England showdown talks in 2016, when they both represented England at the European Championships in France.\n\nWayne and Jamie were both part of the England squad at Euro 2016 as the Three Lions were dumped out by minnows Iceland in one of the greatest international shocks in their history.\n\nThe Times claimed Rooney told Vardy to make sure Rebekah didn't provide a distraction with her social media posts.\n\nWarning: It's understood that Wayne told Vardy to make sure Rebekah didn't provide a distraction with her social media posts\n\nShe had earlier hit out at French police for treating England fans 'like animals'.\n\nEx England boss Roy Hodgson was forced to deny reports that Rooney and Vardy had fallen out during the Euro 2016 tournament.\n\nHodgson said: 'I haven't got a clue what you are referring to. There are absolutely no problems in football terms between Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy.\n\n'In fact quite the reverse, they are very close friends, both on the field and off the field. I have got no idea what you are referring to\n\n'I certainly would advise Wayne to give no comment to it because it is obviously one salacious story that someone has managed to spin. It is of no interest to us.'", "description": "In a video shared on Instagram, the 33-year-old footballer is seen nodding at the blonde woman after being served as he watched patrons dance at US capitol hotspot Living Room DC on Saturday.", "authors": ["Ryan Smith For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/21/19665062-0-image-a-43_1570997923835.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
