Just like one of my top-five favorite famous Canadians, she first got her start on a little teen television series called Degrassi: The Next Generation. Now, she\u2019s filming films, celebrating her ten-year anniversary of being a wildly popular vampire, and sitting front row at Dior\u2019s spring 2020 show in Paris for Paris Fashion Week.\n\nBefore makeup artist Daniel Martin created Dobrev\u2019s very good smoky eye for the occasion (compliments of the Dior\u2019s new Backstage Custom Eye Palette with a new nude Dior Ultra Care lip to match), the Cut quickly caught up with the actress to talk serial-killer face masks, vampire reunions, and croissants.\n\nWhat\u2019s your nighttime beauty routine like?\n\nOh, you have no idea. I think the older I get, the more important it becomes. When I was younger, I\u2019d always just fall asleep in my makeup and it wouldn\u2019t really have an effect but nowadays, because of some maturity, knowledge, and growth, it\u2019s changed.\n\nI take off my makeup with a makeup wipe, just something from CVS, and then it\u2019s all about cleansing, a toner, a great moisturizer, a great eye cream, and all of the serums. I usually use Dr. Sturm under-eye cream at night, and I use Dior Prestige La Cr\u00e8me for my moisturizer. I get so dry in the middle of the night that I also have to use lip balm, and I also use Dior\u2019s lip balm. I also use a D\u00e9esse mask every couple of days before I put on my moisturizer.\n\nWhat time do you go to bed?\n\nJust like my weight, the timing fluctuates [laughs]. I try to go to bed at ten and on good nights, I am able to. For the most part, I crawl into bed at ten and watch a TV show or a movie and fall asleep by 11:30 p.m. or midnight. Not bad, but it could be better.\n\nPhoto: Derek Ketella\n\nHow do you like to deal with jet lag?\n\nIt\u2019s the worst. But then again, it\u2019s not. I travel so much and I\u2019m in so many different time zones, but for the most part, I\u2019m pretty lucky because I sleep well on planes. Other than that, I always have a sleep mask, because if there\u2019s even a crack of light, I\u2019ll be up. I also sleep with a sound machine. Sound machines are my secret weapon because they drown out any noise and keep you in this even-keeled environment that\u2019s peaceful and chill. Between those two and chamomile tea, those are my tricks. I don\u2019t count sheep or anything.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most nervous you\u2019ve ever been?\n\nThere have been two scenarios. One was when I filmed the pilot episode of Fam, the sitcom I was on last year. I was in front of a live audience when I was used to being on set filming and doing multiple takes, with the added pressure of people watching me live. The first time we did that was really scary, but it got easier with time.\n\nThe other time was about a year and a half ago \u2014 the movie is coming out next month \u2014 but I was shooting this film where I had to speak French. I speak it with my family at home but it\u2019s kind of a broken French and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve lived here in France. I was very, very, very nervous because of the pressure of nailing the accent and pronouncing all the words correctly. My family is going to be watching the film and I wanted to live up to their expectations and made sure I did it justice. But at least I didn\u2019t have to do it live!\n\nDaniel Martin and Nina Dobrev.

One of my favorites is one I learned from Daniel Martin, who is actually doing my makeup for the show, which is serendipitous. You know when you want that eyeliner look? Not really thick eyeliner, but you want it to be perfectly on the edge of your lash line; super thin, real close in?\n\nHe taught me that if you draw it in \u2014 like messy, it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect \u2014 make it a thick line from top to bottom. Then, take a wet Q-tip and erase all of it up to the very edge of the lash line and do your makeup around that, your concealer, everything. It makes the perfect, little, thin black line. Instead of trying to make it perfect, just make it messy and delete. I\u2019ve been crushing it that way in the last year or so.\n\nOkay, rapid-fire round \u2026\n\nMatte lips or glossy lips?\n\nMatte lips.\n\nCat eye or smoky eye?\n\nCat eye.\n\nWhat\u2019s the last song you listened to?\n\n\u201cABC\u201d by the Jackson Five. It was on the radio in the car today while I was driving around.\n\nWhat\u2019s the last thing you binge-watched?\n\nEuphoria. Oh my God. Pure gold. I want to rewatch it again, it was so good. Zendaya crushes everything. The girl can do no wrong.\n\nWhat\u2019s on your phone\u2019s lock screen?\n\nMy dog.\n\nWhat\u2019s the last text you sent?\n\nA photo from Ibiza this past weekend with a few of my Vampire Diaries cast members. I took it on my phone, so I just sent it to them via group text.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite snack?\n\nCroissants. Hands down, croissants. Only in Paris. I\u2019ve had three today. Probably not going to fit into my outfit for the show but, you know, when in Rome/when in Paris, you have to do it. They\u2019re French, they\u2019ll understand.\n\nPhoto: Derek Ketella\n\nPhoto: Derek Ketella\n\nPhoto: Derek Ketella\n\nPhoto: Derek Ketella\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Nina Dobrev shares her skincare routine and beauty routine, including her favorite eye cream and the scary LED face masks she wears before going to bed.", "authors": ["Erica Smith"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/25/nina-dobrev/Capture_0267.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
