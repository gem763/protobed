REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo\n\nShares in Rocket Internet, which listed in 2014, jumped in June after a German magazine reported that Samwer was planning to delist the company so he can make more autonomous investment decisions.\n\n\u201cAt this point of time, it is not the strategy of the company to take the company private,\u201d Samwer told a capital markets day.\n\nSamwer said Rocket Internet could consider buying back more shares over the next five years but it was not essential and it would depend on market conditions.\n\nRocket\u2019s shares were up 1.7% at 0927 GMT after the company reported a first-half consolidated profit of 548 million euros ($605.98 million).\n\nAfter a shaky start as losses mounted at its many start-ups, the group has successfully listed a raft of firms including Delivery Hero, HelloFresh and Home24.\n\nSpeculation about a possible delisting has repeatedly surfaced as Rocket\u2019s market capitalisation of 3.7 billion euros is not much above its cash pile of 3 billion euros, plus the 400 million euros in stock it owns in listed companies.\n\nSamwer said he expects to invest some of that cash into the start-ups it is growing, some into new ones and some into public companies, but he is in no rush.\n\n\u201cTwo or three years is not the way you should look at Rocket. We have a long-term strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nRocket has investments in more than 200 private companies, but does not expect any of them to reach the significance of the ones it has listed this year or next. \u201cPeople need to be patient,\u201d he said.\n\nSamwer said he was still upbeat about African online retailer Jumia, in which Rocket holds a 17% stake. Jumia\u2019s U.S.-listed shares slumped last month after it posted another loss and said it had detected cases of employee fraud.\n\n\u201cWe feel very confident about the dominance of this company. The market share of this company is very high,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to be like Amazon in the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nJumia said last month that it was reviewing instances of improper orders and cancellations by employees affecting 4% of gross merchandise value in the first quarter and said several class action lawsuits have been filed against it.", "description": "German ecommerce investor Rocket Internet has no immediate plans to go private, Chief Executive Oliver Samwer told investors on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431548101&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0M9", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
