I\u2019ve had them all in here. Chancers, posers, brown-nosers, moaning Minnies, big-time Charlies and half-pint Harrys.\u201d\n\nNo, not a secret recording of HM the Queen on the appointments she\u2019s made to the Johnson cabinet: The Apprentice (BBC1) is back, for its 15th series and the class of 2019, I am happy to report, are idiots. Gobby, conceited, deluded, chippy, greedy, aggressive, charmless, incoherent, vain, selfish, pretentious and, above all, annoying idiots. The contestants must, perversely, be recruited for their complete absence of business sense or entrepreneurial potential \u2013 but rich abundance of comic value.\n\nWe are familiar with the type, if only from all the previous series of the show, which, let us always remember, gave us the national treasure that is Katie Hopkins (a contestant in 2007), last glimpsed visiting Tommy Robinson in HMP Belmarsh. (I do hope she didn\u2019t jokingly poke a finger through the bars and say \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d to Robinson, aka Mr Yaxley-Lennon).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThough not in the Hopkins league, the scale of the current crop of 16 contestants\u2019 personal and professional failures remains impressive. Some of them are well into their thirties and, without being unnecessarily unkind, it\u2019s fair to conclude that they\u2019ve done sod all with their lives. The gulf between their net worth and their sense of self-worth is unimaginable. Ryan-Mark Parsons, for example, a young Michael McIntyre lookalike, is a bumptious teenager and \u201cluxury womenswear consultant\u201d (which I take to mean he sells knickers in a shop). He declares that he needs \u201cnot millions, billions\u201d to sustain the lifestyle he feels he deserves: one, presumably, where he can afford his own silk knickers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

BBC 2/16 Scarlett Allen-Horton, 32 Recruitment company owner Scarlett says that her upbeat personality means that people \"will often buy into her as a person,\" but admits that she sometimes struggles to accept help from others. Could this cause fireworks in the show's infamous group tasks? 3/16 Jemelin Artigas, 34 Network marketing consultant Jemelin claims she is \"1000 percent committed\" to winning every task but warns that she can be \"next-level stubborn\" when it comes to getting her own way. 4/16 Souleyman Bath, 20 Para athlete and motivational speaker Souleyman trains with the Great Britain Paralympic team as a sprinter, having been diagnosed with Retina Pigmentosa aged six. \"The less sight I have, the more imagination I gain, because what you see is what you see and what you don't see is when the magic begins,\" he says. 5/16 Lewis Ellis, 28 Lewis is a digital marketing project manager and describes himself as a \"maverick\", who believes his competitiveness and determination will see him through the process.

She says she is a natural leader and that people latch onto her to benefit from the influence she carries. She believes it\u2019s \u201cwritten in the stars\u201d that she\u2019ll be Lord Sugar\u2019s next Apprentice, describing herself as a \"pocket rocket\" due to her height (5ft 1\"). 11/16 Lottie Lion, 19 Lottie the librarian says she is \u201cvery cut throat\u201d and insists that she is no push over. She believes her poise and her \u201cpowers of persuasion\u201d are her greatest business qualities, noting that people with bad manners anger her and that she gets frustrated when things don\u2019t adhere to her high standards. 12/16 Ryan-Mark Parsons, 19 Ryan-Mark is an award-winning public speaker who admires the Queen and describes himself as the \"epitome of luxury\".

But watch out for her enemies - Masood is not afraid of keeping her friends close but her enemies closer, and she says: \"I can read people just by looking at their body language, they won\u2019t realise it until it\u2019s too late \u2013 and checkmate\u201d. 14/16 Kenna Ngoma, 24 Before creating his alcohol-infused ice cream company in 2018, Kenna played semi-professional football for Manchester City before that was cut short by injury in 2013.

She admits that she doesn\u2019t have a filter and may need to \u201cdial down her American-ness\u201d and take a step back, as she says she can be too direct. 16/16 Thomas Skinner, 28 Pillow company owner Thomas started out in business aged 12, with a paper round, and later worked on the markets when he was 16. Since then he has set up his own pillow company, attributing his business success to his \u201csharp\u201d, \u201cstreet wise\u201d character. 1/16 Dean Ahmad, 20 Dean founded his sports management agency aged 15 and believes he is \"the definition of an entrepreneur\", with confidence and emotional intelligence that are \"off the charts\".

Since then he has set up his own pillow company, attributing his business success to his \u201csharp\u201d, \u201cstreet wise\u201d character.\n\nThen there\u2019s Jemelin Artigas, 34, a Venezuelan \u201cmarketing consultant\u201d. She boasts, beyond parody: \u201cYou can actually cut me and ambition comes out of my blood.\u201d Not that it matters, but that doesn\u2019t, actually, make any sense, but, even if it did, it can\u2019t be right, because if her ambition really was that visceral, she wouldn\u2019t be scrubbing round on some reality TV show for a nominal \u00a3250,000 to go and invest in some hopeless business venture with Alan Sugar. Would she?\n\nAnyway, for week one they all get a free trip to South Africa to undertake their first task, which is to make a few quid from a \u201ctourist experience\u201d \u2013 selling tickets and organising an upmarket event. The girls opt for a booze-up at a Western Cape vineyard, which is a good enough idea. Charlotte Allen-Horton volunteers to be project manager, and if all else fails she can always make a decent living as a Meghan Markle impersonator, though she\u2019d have to work on her Brummie accent a bit. The tour of the winery is, obviously, a disaster as the girls get lost and the trek resembles, according to Sugar sidekick Claude Littner, a Benny Hill sketch.\n\nThe intensely irritating Lottie Lion is in a state of open warfare with the intensely ineffectual Lubna (\u201cI\u2019m disgustingly ambitious\u201d) Farhan. I might have more sympathy for pushy Lottie, who knows her wines it must be said, were it not for the fact that she is currently a school librarian. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but lending out The Hungry Caterpillar to eight-year-olds is, shall we say, a rather unconventional way of emulating Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett.\n\nStill, the \u201cladies\u201d manage to make \u00a344.76 more profit than the \u201cboys\u201d, who bugger up their safari venture (too few tickets and trinkets sell). They are condemned to indulge in the mutual recriminations over mugs of tea at the Bridge Cafe, followed by the usual boardroom bollocking, in full The Apprentice tradition.\n\nOne thing that remains reassuringly undimmed over the past 15 years of output is Sugar\u2019s taste for appallingly cheesy gags. These are the only things that seem to make his usually unyielding features crease into a passable imitation of the late Sid James. Thus, he chuckled that out in Africa the zebras \u201ccome with their own bar code\u201d, and the kids all laughed along like it was the funniest thing ever said. It was as if they were going along with it all just to raise their profile enough to scrape an easy living as C-list celebrities, with a business plan precariously based on appearance fees with the likes of Gok Wan, Amber Gill and Joey Essex on Celebrity Most Haunted or Strictly Come Dancing (if they are lucky).\n\nYou probably need to at least make it to the final of The Apprentice to ensure that level of fame and fortune, though, and I am sorry to say that Shahin \u201cThe Falcon\u201d Hassan (36, chartered engineer) found himself on the wrong end of Sugar\u2019s famous index figure and catchphrase, for the simple but undeniable economic crime of failing to sell a single ticket for the ill-fated safari.\n\nThe Apprentice has been out-competed as the light entertainment business show of choice by Dragons\u2019 Den, and Britain seems less enthralled by making money and less inclined to mistake worldly success for happiness than it was pre-crash, pre-recession and pre-Brexit.\n\nThen again, if there is one thing that Global Britain is still a world-beater at, it\u2019s producing grotesques to makes fools of themselves on The Apprentice: the supply appears inexhaustible, even under no-deal Brexit. Boris should stick that on the side of a bus.", "description": "\u201cNever, ever underestimate me. I\u2019ve had them all in here.
