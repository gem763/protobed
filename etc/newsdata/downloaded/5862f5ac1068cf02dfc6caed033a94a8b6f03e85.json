But then Mr Turnbull pulled the rug out on the push by state premiers Mike Baird and Jay Weatherill to reform both the tax system and federal-state financial relations. Now Scott Morrison wants to keep politics off the front page so the quiet Australians can enjoy summer and the disoriented Labor Party can continue to fight among itself.\n\nAmid this policy torpor, the reform leadership is again coming from the states, led by NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet. The NSW\u2019s government\u2019s Review of Federal Financial Relations, chaired by former Telstra chief executive David Thodey, is driven by looming pressures on state government budgets. But the bigger, and related issue, is to lessen the burden of Australia\u2019s tax system on the incentives to work, save, invest and hire and so revive the nation\u2019s flatlining productivity and prosperity.\n\nThe key NSW proposal is a tax-mix-switch that would extend the GST to fresh food, health, and education, allowing inefficient state taxes, including stamp duty charges on housing purchases, to be abolished. Increasing the states\u2019 GST revenue, and creating a more efficient and fairer revenue base via a broad-based land tax would reduce their fiscal dependency on federal grants and make them more accountable for raising the money they spend. While the state budgets account for almost 50 per cent of all government spending, they raise only 24 per cent of their own revenue. Greater financial autonomy and clearer responsibility for the service delivery would also encourage state governments to innovate and deliver the best outcomes and value for taxpayer\u2019s dollars, particularly in big spending areas like health and education.\n\nThe key NSW proposal is a tax-mix-switch that would extend the GST to fresh food, health and education.\n\nAs the NSW review makes clear, state finances are under threat due to a mix of demographic and technological factors that have been obscured by the boom in stamp duty revenue in NSW and Victoria. This distortion essentially acts as a tax on putting land and property to its most efficient use. State spending on health, mainly public hospitals, is escalating as the population ages. But GST receipts are set to erode as ageing households increase spending on GST-exempt healthcare. Failing petrol excise due to electric cars and fuel-efficient engines will also mean less future federal revenue for distribution to the states.\n\nThis is an agenda that eventually will have to be grasped. But it will require political leadership and preparation, especially from Canberra. Some Labor state governments, led by Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas and his West Australian counterpart Ben Wyatt, say that they are at least prepared to have a conversation about the issues raised by the NSW plan. But, by quickly ruling out the NSW agenda, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has merely kicked it down the road.", "description": "Instead of ducking for political cover, the Morrison government should be championing reform of the tax system and federal-state financial relations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6573%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c402a012d119c6055c37798e75c617119da1ff77", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
