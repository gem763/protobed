It Was Wrong About 20%.", "language": "en", "text": "Frank LaRose, on Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019, in Dayton, Ohio, is a Republican and Ohio\u2019s secretary of state. (Maddie McGarvey/The New York Times)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 The clock was ticking for Jen Miller.\n\nThe state of Ohio had released names of 235,000 voters it planned to purge from voter rolls in September.\n\nMiller, director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, believed thousands of voters were about to be wrongly removed.\n\nOver the summer, the Ohio secretary of state had sent her organization and others like it a massive spreadsheet with the 235,000 names and addresses that would be purged from the state\u2019s voter rolls in just a month \u2014 a list of people that, state officials said, some part of the bureaucracy flagged as deceased, living somewhere else or as a duplicate. The League of Women Voters had been asked to see if any of those purged qualified to register again.\n\nMiller, who spends her work day helping register people to vote, scrolled through the names and then asked herself a question: What was her own voter status in the state?\n\nShe went online and discovered that her name had also been flagged as an inactive voter. The state was in the process of removing her from its voter rolls.\n\n\u201cI voted three times last year,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have any idea how many other individuals this has happened to.\u201d\n\nOhio, where the Democratic presidential candidates are set to debate Tuesday, is both a battleground state and the site of some of the country\u2019s strictest voting laws, from voter ID requirements to a \u201cuse-it-or-lose-it\u201d provision that lets officials drop voters seen as inactive.\n\nThe combination has led voting rights advocates to contend that parts of the state are regularly disenfranchised, largely in purges aimed at those who have died or moved away, but which also hit real voters who don\u2019t learn they can\u2019t vote until Election Day. Election officials in other battlegrounds like Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and Texas regularly purge their voter lists as well.\n\nThis year, a group of elected officials in the state, mostly all moderate Republicans, tried to answer the concerns with an experiment of their own: Rather than purge the voter rolls behind closed doors as had been done in the past, the government released the full list of those to be removed this summer, and gave the list to advocacy groups. The groups said they found the list was riddled with errors.\n\nThe result: Around 40,000 people, nearly 1 in 5 names on the list, shouldn\u2019t have been on it, the state determined. And it only found out before anyone was actually turned away at a polling place largely because of volunteer sleuthing.\n\nFew people had expected a problem at that scale.\n\nBut the process gave hope to people working on voting rights, who for years had pushed the state to be more transparent in how it was maintaining its voter rolls. Moderate Republicans, caught between advocacy groups pushing for fewer purges and more conservative leaders in other states urging for more, think they may have found a way to thread the needle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about crowdsourcing, in simply putting the list out there,\u201d said Frank LaRose, Ohio\u2019s secretary of state, whose office oversaw the purge and who manages the election here.\n\nOhio\u2019s needle-threading experiment this year \u2014 the only time advocates say a state government has released a list ahead of time \u2014 also offers one of the first looks at how so many names could be incorrectly removed from the rolls.\n\nIn one case, a data mistake from an outside firm meant a large number of people\u2019s names were set to be knocked off. Ohio\u2019s 88 counties each used a different process of removing people from the rolls, an immediate source of headaches for officials trying to compile a statewide list.\n\nAnd voting rights groups found an unexplained tranche \u2014 around 20,000 people \u2014 who had been marked to be purged because of inactivity in future election cycles, but were actually active voters in previous Ohio elections. These voters were in Franklin County, a Democratic stronghold in the state.\n\nUnder Ohio law, the state is allowed to cull voters\u2019 names from the rolls if they haven\u2019t voted in six years and don\u2019t respond to a postcard from the state informing them that they are about to be purged and need to take action. Voting groups challenged the law in court saying such rules suppress the vote, but the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision last year, disagreed and found so-called use-it-or-use-it laws constitutional.", "description": "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The clock was ticking for Jen Miller.The state of Ohio had released names of 235,000 voters it planned to purge from voter rolls in September.Miller, director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, believed thousands of voters were about to be wrongly removed.Over the summer, the Ohio", "authors": ["Nicholas Casey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e1hcIT.e6_4HDIncij3mOQ--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/a53b3ec4cf51bf60fb05435bdb418e9f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
