Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who called it \"irresponsible\" and a \"stain on America's honor.\"\n\n'A reckless gamble': Four reasons critics decry Trump's 'impulsive' Syria withdrawal\n\nAbandoning an ally\n\nAs U.S. troops move aside, Turkey plans a military incursion into Syria against those it considers terrorist threats, including Kurdish fighters who joined America in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\nThe U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces \u2013 which dismantled its fortifications in the border region as part of an agreement meant to assuage Turkey's security concerns \u2013 blasted the U.S. move, saying the SDF had honored its commitments but its American allies \"did not fulfill their obligations.\"\n\nThe SDF said it lost 11,000 fighters in the war against the Islamic State in Syria.\n\nGraham said Trump's decision \"will be a stain on America's honor for abandoning the Kurds,\" and \"we have sent the most dangerous signal possible \u2013 America is an unreliable ally.\"\n\n\"The U.S. convinced the Kurds to destroy ISIS for us, causing massive Kurd casualties. Then we conned the Kurds into dismantling their defenses, promising to protect them. Now Trump invites the Turks into Syria, green lighting them to wipe out the Kurds,\" tweeted Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"Positively sinister.\"\n\nMore: On Syria, Donald Trump cites 'my great and unmatched wisdom' \u2013 others say no way\n\nThe U.S. convinced the Kurds to destroy ISIS for us, causing massive Kurd casualties.\n\n\n\nThen we conned the Kurds into dismantling their defenses, promising to protect them.\n\n\n\nNow Trump invites the Turks into Syria, green lighting them to wipe out the Kurds.\n\n\n\nPositively sinister.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) October 7, 2019\n\nThe President\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal.

Mazloum Kobani, the commander of SDF forces, warned that the terrorist group still posed \"a great threat to our region and the world.\"\n\nThe SDF said Islamic State sleeper cells plot to free about 12,000 militants detained by the Kurdish fighters in the region and plan moves against the al-Hol refugee camp where about 70,000 people are held, including militants' family members.\n\nBrett McGurk \u2013 who served as Trump's envoy to a global coalition fighting the Islamic State before resigning in 2018 over a disagreement on pulling U.S. forces from Syria \u2013 said Turkey \"has neither the intent, desire, nor capacity to manage\" the massive al-Hol camp, which the inspectors general for the State Department and the Pentagon \"warn is the nucleus for a resurgent ISIS.\"\n\n\"Believing otherwise is a reckless gamble with our national security,\" he said.", "description": "Romney called it a \"betrayal\" that makes the U.S. look like \"an unreliable ally,\" speeds an ISIS resurgence and creates a \"humanitarian disaster.\"", "authors": ["William Cummings", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k.bDkqAx1plh0Eq5I8xOgA--~B/aD0zMTQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/526f709c23f60ff874ca8a2e88811e6f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
