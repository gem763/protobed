Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who has authored many of the nation\u2019s whistleblower laws, said the person who filed the complaint about the president \u201cappears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should always work to respect whistleblowers\u2019 requests for confidentiality,\u201d Mr. Grassley said in a statement. \u201cAny further media reports on the whistleblower\u2019s identity don\u2019t serve the public interest \u2014 even if the conflict sells more papers or attracts clicks.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNo one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts. Uninformed speculation wielded by politicians or media commentators as a partisan weapon is counterproductive and doesn\u2019t serve the country.\u201d\n\nMr. Grassley said \u201cthe distinctions being drawn between first- and secondhand knowledge aren\u2019t legal ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not part of whistleblower protection law or any agency policy,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cComplaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim\u2019s credibility.\u201d\n\nThe complaint involves the president\u2019s July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump asked for an investigation of Democratic frontrunner Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter. The younger Biden had received $3 million in his post with a Ukrainian gas company, and the elder Biden had pressured Ukraine while serving as vice president in 2016 to oust a prosecutor who had been investigating the company.\n\nMr. Biden said the prosecutor wasn\u2019t pursuing corruption cases.\n\nHouse Democrats say Mr. Trump was seeking foreign help to interfere in the 2020 election, and that he was withholding military aid to Ukraine as leverage. The president denies those accusations.\n\n\u201cThis is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer, warmer, or better,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cNo pressure at all (as confirmed by Ukrainian Pres.). It is just another Democrat Hoax!\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.", "description": "Sen. Charles E.
