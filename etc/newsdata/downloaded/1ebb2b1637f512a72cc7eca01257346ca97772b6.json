Some in No. 10 say the current Brexit deadlock in the House of Commons, where there is no clear majority for any approach to deal with the issue, calls for strong language.\n\nHowever, later in the day Johnson appeared to soften his position somewhat. Asked by the BBC's Peter Henley whether his description of the law designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit as the \"surrender act\" risked alienating Labour MPs who might otherwise help him get any deal he strikes with Brussels through a House of Commons vote, he sounded more conciliatory.\n\n\"Well, I think it's fair enough to call the surrender act what it is,\" Johnson said. \"But you are also right, Peter, we do need to bring people together, and get this thing done.\"\n\n\"And so, if I may say so, I think actually you're right tempers need to come down, and people need to come together because it's only by getting Brexit done that you\u2019ll lance the boil, as it were, of the current anxiety and we will be able to get on with the domestic agenda.\u201d\n\n\"I've had death threats overnight... it's a disgrace\" Labour MP Karl Turner's staff film an encounter with Boris Johnson's senior adviser, Dominic Cummingshttps://t.co/2JL9D2WW2f pic.twitter.com/agGnyOiUMR \u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) September 26, 2019\n\nDowning Street hopes the current dispute will play into their strategy of portraying Johnson as a champion of those who voted for Brexit, fighting a recalcitrant parliament, and that the more outrage they provoke in MPs, the more this narrative is reinforced.\n\nSimilar tactics were deployed during the Vote Leave campaign, when the erroneous claim that EU membership costs the U.K. \u00a3350 million a week were repeated over and over despite objections from opponents, because it kept the debate on Vote Leave\u2019s favored battlefield: the cost of the EU, and the ability to redirect that money to the NHS.\n\nHostile House of Commons\n\nDuring an angry Commons debate on Wednesday night, Labour MP Paula Sheriff said she had received death threats from members of the public containing words used by the prime minister such as \u201csurrender\u201d \u2014 the term Johnson used in the same debate to describe a new law which will force a Brexit delay if no deal is agreed with Brussels.\n\n\u201cI have to say that I have never heard such humbug in all my life,\u201d Johnson shot back.\n\nHe later told Labour MP Tracy Brabin, who was elected to replace Cox after she was murdered by a far-right extremist shortly before the EU referendum, that \u201cthe best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to bring this country together is, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nFormer Tory MP Nicholas Soames said this morning that he feels \"despair\" at the prime minister's words. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" program, he said: \"What the prime minister did yesterday is to drive it [the country] further apart.\"\n\nHowever, Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly told the same program that the \u201chighly charged\u201d atmosphere in parliament would only calm down once Brexit is resolved. He added the comment from Johnson about \u201chumbug\u201d referred to other claims made by Sheriff that were untrue.\n\nBut Sheriff argued the prime minister was \u201cinciting hatred towards MPs\u201d at a time when abuse of public figures is at an all-time high. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, she said: \u201cPeople are really frightened and for him to treat it almost like a joke, was absolutely horrific and demeans the office of prime minister.\u201d\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission, which is funded by the government but operates independently, also issued a statement criticizing the use of hostile language in the Brexit debate.\n\n\"Words have consequences and after the referendum we wrote to all political parties reminding them of the need for respectful debate at all times \u2014 no matter how difficult the issues,\" its chairman, David Isaac, said. \"Sadly this has not happened. I urge all our politicians to show the best version of themselves so all views are heard. Hard-line rhetoric and gestures only serve to create a more polarized society and will not heal the divisions that exist in our country.\"\n\nBrexit consensus further away\n\nAnother Labour MP, Lisa Nandy, told the Commons the hostile approach by Downing Street is making it \u201cmuch more difficult\u201d for opposition MPs who want Brexit delivered to work with the government to pass a deal.\n\nJunior Cabinet Office Minister Kevin Foster was sent by the government to respond to an urgent question in the House of Commons on the prime minister\u2019s language.\n\nRepeating the prime minister\u2019s insistence that delivering Brexit is the best way to cool the political temperature, he said: \u201cThe biggest issue is that delay will just bring more division to this country.\u201d\n\nHe added that the best way to tackle the issue is to \u201cbring a resolution to debates.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same debate, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s language and demeanor yesterday was frankly nothing short of disgraceful.\n\n\u201cThree years ago our colleague, our member, Jo Cox, was murdered by a far-right activist shouting \u2018Britain First, this is for Britain.\u2019 The language that politicians use matters and has real consequences.\n\n\u201cTo dismiss concerns from members about the death threats they receive and to dismiss concerns that the language by the prime minister is being repeated in those death threats is reprehensible.\u201d\n\nThis article was updated with additional information.", "description": "The prime minister denies having dismissed the abuse MPs face from members of the public as \u2018humbug.\u2019", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Charlie Cooper", "Paul Dallison", "Kate Day"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171295269-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
