Now that unit will fold.\n\nThe review focused on transforming McDonald's marketing by integrating digital and data\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the pitch, the new model stemmed from then-new McDonald's CMO Deborah Wahl's desire to fully integrate digital and data into the rest of the chain's marketing operations for the first time.\n\nMcDonald's primary goal was not to save money but achieve more consistent messaging and control over the entire consumer journey using data from McDonald's customers.\n\nThe scale of the chain's business in its largest region made this particularly challenging, but the source said McDonald's updated its internal marketing and production processes to support the new agency model.\n\nFor example, executives at McDonald's interviewed team leaders at multiple holding companies to identify potential workflow problems ahead of the pitch and designed the RFP to overcome the issues they identified.\n\nIn terms of why Omnicom beat out rivals WPP and Publicis, the source said Omnicom's team was truly integrated across strategy, creative concepting, production, and media planning and buying, while Publicis simply mashed together the services of lead creative shop Leo Burnett with \"digital business transformation partner\" Publicis Sapient.\n\nOmnicom positioned its new \"flex model,\" which focused heavily on insights from social media, as unique despite similarities to other agencies\n\nThe second source said the Omnicom pitch focused heavily on its ability to respond in near-real-time to sentiments people shared about McDonald's on social media by creating a set of scheduled posts each day in response to data gathered the previous day. By noon, the agency would have content ready for McDonald's to send out across its social channels.\n\nThe internal documents reflect this winning approach, which Omnicom-owned We Are Unlimited and its parent company, Omnicom agency DDB Worldwide, dubbed the \"Flex model.\"\n\nOmnicom called the unit dedicated to McDonald's \"Cortex,\" describing it as \"a data-informed view of customers [created] by gathering insights in real-time from experts across digital, social, retail, behavior.\"\n\nThe holding company quickly adapted the model to pitch other clients, including Heineken, State Farm, Volkswagen, and the US Army. The deck demonstrates how DDB positioned the offering as unique within the industry \u2014 even while acknowledging its similarity to the approaches of rival agencies like GroupM, J. Walter Thompson, and R/GA.\n\nDeborah Wahl left McDonald's in April 2017, less than six months after We Are Unlimited officially launched, and became Cadillac's CMO in March 2018.\n\nWahl did not respond to a request for comment, nor did representatives for McDonald's and DDB.\n\nThese two documents show how Omnicom would structure its McDonald's team\n\nWe Are Unlimited\n\nWe Are Unlimited\n\nLater materials show how the same approach could be applied to other clients\n\nOmnicom\n\nOmnicom\n\nOmnicom\n\nOmnicom\n\nOmnicom\n\nOmnicom", "description": "As McDonald's transitions away from its exclusive relationship with Omnicom in the US, documents show how the holding company won the account.", "authors": ["Patrick Coffee"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8942862e22af31e8369af4-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
