Some of the more intrepid midnight summiteers hiked a switch-backed trail through the woods along its flank; the most ambitious clambered nearly vertically to the summit. (I made a try, but I\u2019d worn the wrong shoes.) Others were whisked upward by Fjellheisen, the mountain\u2019s popular aerial tramway.\n\nAt the top, the assembled crowd earnestly awaited the disappearance of the Sun, which had not been absent from Troms\u00f8\u2019s sky for two whole months. Before our eyes, it vanished, regally swathed in brilliant Arctic pink and violet and orange. And an hour later it reappeared, commencing Troms\u00f8\u2019s gradual shortening of days until the start of the midwinter interval of absolutely no sunlight at all.\n\nCuriously, the sizeable Muslim population of Troms\u00f8 took little notice of the spectacle. Whenever I mentioned the impending sunset to a Muslim resident, the response was some version of a shrug. Behind this indifference lies an interesting story of cultural displacement, nostalgia, adjustment and endless debate about niceties of solar astronomy.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The Europeans who chose mystical Islam\n\n\u2022 The religion passed down from Vikings\n\n\u2022 The synagogues preserved by Muslims\n\nNo major religion\u2019s daily ritual observances are tied more closely to the movement of the Sun than Islam\u2019s. \u201cAs a child, I watched for sunrise and sunset,\u201d said Hussein Abdi Yusuf nostalgically, \u201cand I listened five times a day for the prayer calls from the mosque.\u201d Yusuf is the imam of Al Rahma, the smaller of Troms\u00f8\u2019s two mosques, located in a plain green house that the congregation has rented since 1991. Soft-spoken and affable, Yusuf grew up in a religious family in Somalia where, as he puts it, everything revolved around the times of prayer, which are determined by sunrise and sunset. Under normal circumstances, the first prayer of the five each day (Fajr) precedes sunrise; the last (Isha) follows shortly after Maghrib, the sunset prayer.\n\nOther members of Troms\u00f8\u2019s Islamic community told me similar stories of displacement from the orderly dawns and dusks of their childhoods. Mansoor Waizy, who is on the governing board of Alnor Senter, the larger of the two mosques, spoke of uprooting himself from Kabul to Germany, and how in Kabul \u201cyou divided the day according to the prayer times\u201d, but in Germany the rhythm of the workday took precedence.\n\n\u201cIn Germany, the change was frustrating,\u201d said Waizy, \u201cbut at least the sun still rose and set.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, he moved to Troms\u00f8 and recalls how disorienting it was to pray Maghrib with the sun still high in the sky. \u201cI prayed in a really confused way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe solution to undoing, or at least mitigating, this confusion, has been perhaps the foremost faith-related challenge for Norway\u2019s Arctic Islamic communities. (In addition to the two Troms\u00f8 mosques, there\u2019s a small mosque in the city of Alta, to the east and slightly further north, and another in Hammerfest, even further north.) What\u2019s an acceptable compromise when the Sun behaves in a manner incompatible with the fundamental principles of the Islamic prayer schedule?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure it out,\u201d answered Ole Martin Risan, a Troms\u00f8-born convert to Islam, when we chatted in Alnor Senter\u2019s kitchen, two blocks south of Al Rahma near the heart of Troms\u00f8\u2019s tourist district.\n\nAlnor Senter occupies an unprepossessing but spacious former dance studio on a steeply sloped street that descends toward Troms\u00f8\u2019s waterfront. Spacious as it is, the mosque can seem small at prayer time: during the Friday afternoon and evening prayer services I attended, the prayer room was bursting at the seams. On the busiest prayer day of the year, Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the assembled congregation is so large \u2013 approaching triple digits \u2013 that Alnor Senter and Al Rahma join forces and worship together at a local municipal gymnasium that\u2019s normally the home of the Troms\u00f8 Storm basketball team.\n\nThe problem of accommodating worshippers is driven by two factors: tourism and immigration, both of which are expanding Troms\u00f8\u2019s permanent and transient Muslim community.\n\n\u201cIn the last few years [tourism has] been blowing up,\u201d said Nadia Hakmi, who was born into a Muslim family in Troms\u00f8 and works in the busy cruise-ship sector of Troms\u00f8\u2019s hospitality industry. Troms\u00f8 is marketed heavily in South-East Asia as a wilderness outpost where the skies blaze with auroras and the streets are roamed by \u201cice bears\u201d (polar bears). Visiting Islamic tourists, including Halal tourism groups, often drop in at Alnor Senter to keep up their daily routine of prayer.\n\n\u201cSometimes the prayer room gets so crowded [with tourists] that the congregation overflows into the neighbouring classrooms,\u201d said Siv Samira Kofoed, a long-time Alnor Senter congregant.\n\nTourism is at the heart of the local economy, so much so that Troms\u00f8 has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Norway, according to Yusuf. It\u2019s this prosperity, in part, that draws immigrants from countries like Somalia and Ethiopia who are fleeing war and poverty and find a measure of stability and opportunity in Europe\u2019s far north. After prayer at Alnor Senter, I chatted with several young men enrolled at the University of Troms\u00f8. There they were availing themselves of a wealth of career-building opportunities. Some said they expected to move south to Oslo or Stockholm once they earned their degrees; others envisioned praying with their children in Alnor Senter\u2019s prayer room.\n\nThose who remain will continue the tradition of seeking to reconcile traditional Islamic daily prayer with the peculiarities of Arctic astronomy. At Alnor Senter, the effort goes back to the mosque\u2019s founding in 2006 by another Troms\u00f8-born convert, Sandra (Maryam) Moe. Moe and other leaders of the mosque contacted Islamic scholars in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kuwait, posing the question of the midnight sun and its bearing on the timing of daily prayer. The scholars issued a fatwa (a legal opinion) offering three choices: coordinate prayer times with the nearest country where the Sun rises and sets regularly throughout the year; allow individual mosque members to coordinate with their countries of origin; or sync the Troms\u00f8 schedule to sunrise and sunset in the holy city of Mecca, the birthplace of the prophet Muhammad.\n\nBoth Troms\u00f8 mosques agreed to the last option, at least provisionally: \u201cUntil we could find something better,\u201d Waizy said. He and others believed that the proposed arrangement didn\u2019t fully address their new identity as Norwegian Muslims. It simply imposed a schedule from a distant locale.\n\nIt\u2019s always been agreed that no decision would be final\n\nThe search for a better solution took a turn in April of this year when the imams of the two mosques travelled to Sweden to debate the prayer-time issue, and the separate but related question of fasting during Ramadan, with Islamic scholars from Denmark, Sweden and Finland, as well as representatives from the communities in Alta and Hammerfest.\n\nAfter much deliberation, the scholars made a suggestion, essentially proposing to localise the two afternoon prayers \u2013 Zuhr and Asr \u2013 by determining the daily highest position of the Sun as observed from each individual Arctic mosque. (In winter, this observation would be indirect, via calculation, but it would still be tied to each individual location.) As for the earlier and later prayers each day, the schedule would introduce an adjustment, keyed to Mecca sunrise and sunset, to round out a balanced daily worship schedule.\n\nSince April, this synthesis of local and Mecca times has been the official system for prayer in Troms\u00f8. Still, it\u2019s a work in progress. As Hakmi explained, \u201cIt\u2019s always been agreed that no decision would be final. The process is ongoing.\u201d And in fact, in mid-December 2019, the Troms\u00f8 mosques will host a follow-up conference specifically to revisit the schedule tentatively developed in April.\n\nNot everyone adheres to the new schedule: a few congregants continue to follow Mecca time, while others remain attached to their countries of origin \u2013 Yusuf pointed out two members of Al Rahma who time their prayers to sunrise and sunset in Paris, their home town.\n\nWe were on the back steps of Al Rahma just after evening prayer, as lingering worshippers chatted in the small lot behind the green house. I asked Yusuf whether the prospect of the sunless winter ahead disheartened him. He responded that he\u2019d grown used to it. He\u2019d had a long journey. After fleeing violence in Somalia, he\u2019d spent four years in Harstad \u2013 another small northern Norwegian town, south of Troms\u00f8 but still north of the Arctic Circle \u2013 before taking up residence as Al Rahma\u2019s imam.\n\nIn just a few months a melancholy solar farewell would take place atop Mount Storsteinen, and the Sun would not rise again in Troms\u00f8 until next year. Yusuf looked up at the sky, which already had a subtle feel of early twilight. \u201cThis country gives us something different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have peace in this country. That means a lot.\u201d\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
