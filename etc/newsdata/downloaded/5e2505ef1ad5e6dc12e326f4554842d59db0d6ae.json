Mainers Haven't Forgotten.", "language": "en", "text": "On a warm October morning in 2018, busloads of women converged on Capitol Hill and made their way to Sen. Susan Collins\u2019 office. The Maine Republican was ostensibly on the fence about whether to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in light of several sexual misconduct allegations against him.\n\nDozens of sexual assault survivors and their allies lingered outside Collins\u2019 door, hoping for a chance to explain why supporting Kavanaugh would be a monumental mistake. But Collins was busy that day, her staff said, poring through the FBI\u2019s limited investigation into the accusations against him.\n\nThe next day, Collins delivered a marathon speech from the Senate floor announcing she would vote for Kavanaugh, cementing a spot on the bench for President Donald Trump\u2019s second Supreme Court nominee.\n\nFor some of her constituents, Collins\u2019 vote was an awakening. The most senior Republican woman in the Senate, a self-proclaimed pro-choice moderate, had just sung the praises of an accused sexual predator whose anti-abortion views could jeopardize the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nAndrew Lichtenstein via Getty Images Women's rights activists opposed to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the the Supreme Court occupy Senator Susan Collins of Maine's office and listen to her speech on the Senate floor explaining why she is supporting the nomination on October 5, 2018, in Washington, D.C.\n\nOthers \u2015 those more familiar with Collins\u2019 record \u2014 were less surprised: The four-term senator often hid behind her \u201cmoderate\u201d cloak, but rarely broke with the Republican Party on votes where she could make a difference.\n\nIn the end, Collins\u2019 support for Kavanaugh appeared to spark a nearly universal sentiment among Mainers who opposed his confirmation, whether they were longtime political activists or speaking out for the first time: betrayal.\n\nA year later, that feeling continues to enrage and mobilize many Maine voters. Though Collins hasn\u2019t yet formally announced her reelection campaign, she\u2019s amassed several Democratic challengers, including Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon; Betsy Sweet, a women\u2019s rights advocate and a former Maine gubernatorial candidate; and attorney Bre Kidman.\n\nKidman, who uses the pronouns them and they, was one of the sexual assault survivors from Maine who traveled hundreds of miles to Washington last year in an attempt to persuade Collins not to vote for Kavanaugh.\n\nOn the one-year anniversary of his confirmation, Kidman returned to Washington, where they joined hundreds of people outside the Supreme Court protesting Kavanaugh, including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), who introduced a resolution last month calling for his impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about sexual assault. It\u2019s not just about a political move,\u201d Kidman told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s about her not listening to us and I don\u2019t think anyone is going to let her forget it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year, I was nervous to beg my senator to do the right thing,\u201d they added. \u201cAnd this year, I\u2019m coming for her job and nerves be damned.\u201d\n\nAlso, today @AyannaPressley told me I was very brave and to keep going and she is so intense and so powerful and I guess that means I have to keep going \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f#survivorsquad #ReclaimTheCourt pic.twitter.com/IdRuTFy04o \u2014 bre\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08kidman\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8for\ud83e\udd9eMaine\ud83c\udf39(D) (@BeeKay4ME) October 6, 2019\n\nHundreds of Collins\u2019 critics protested in Washington and across Maine on Sunday. In Bar Harbor, more than a dozen women staged a die-in for 43 minutes \u2015 the length of Collins\u2019 Kavanaugh speech on the Senate floor \u2015 in one of Maine\u2019s most scenic parks, eliciting encouragement from tourists and local passersby.\n\n\u201cPeople who weren\u2019t really active in the last election are ready to go knock on doors,\u201d said Gail Leiser, a member of Indivisible MDI, a local chapter of the progressive movement that organized the demonstration. \u201cThey have that sense of betrayal.\u201d\n\nCollins has \u201calways been a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing,\u201d she added. \u201cShe\u2019s always presented as a moderate, but would always toe the party line. A lot of people couldn\u2019t see that. But a lot of people have been awakened. What she says and what she does are two different things.\u201d\n\nJennifer Steen Booher A protester in Maine holding a cut-out of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nAdditional protests unfolded across Maine on Sunday, from one outside Collins\u2019 house in Bangor, to one 130 miles southwest at Portland City Hall.\n\nDini Merz, a co-founder of the progressive political action committee Mainers for Accountable Leadership, spoke at the Portland event. She came out as a sexual assault survivor a year ago while urging Collins to vote \u201cno\u201d on Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cElection after election, she has said she\u2019s pro-choice, that she believes in the right of women to have integrity over their own body,\u201d Merz told HuffPost. \u201cYet she was the pivotal vote in putting onto the Supreme Court someone with a known history of being restrictive of women\u2019s bodies. Everything he does on that court that confirms that is an albatross around her neck.\u201d\n\nSexual assault survivor Dini Merz of @mfalpac reminds us we are a collective of diverse, strong, powerful people. We fought for the right to vote, to criminalize rape, and will keep fighting. #mepolitics #reclaimthecourts pic.twitter.com/aziPAOqSNC \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPMEAF) October 6, 2019\n\nWithin weeks of Collins\u2019 vote for Kavanaugh, a crowdfunding campaign raised millions of dollars toward whoever would become Collins\u2019 Democratic challenger in 2020. Collins\u2019 vote also proved lucrative for herself; she raised more money that quarter than any other fundraising period of her career, though the vast majority came from out-of-state.\n\nIn the year since Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, several states have passed sweeping anti-abortion laws. Some of these Republican-led states hope the restrictive laws will force the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade, which effectively made abortion legal nationwide.\n\nThe Supreme Court announced Friday it would hear an abortion case this term \u2015 its first since the retirement of swing justice Anthony Kennedy last year. The case has stoked fears among women\u2019s rights advocates that their reproductive rights are on the chopping block.\n\nStill, Collins \u2015 whose office did not respond to a request for comment \u2015 has said she has no regrets over her vote to confirm Kavanaugh. In fact, she appears to have really embraced it despite the majority of her constituents having opposed it at the time. She sent out mailers accusing \u201cfar left extremists\u201d of attacking her over her vote, and attended a fundraiser in California where she was hailed the \u201chero of the Kavanaugh confirmation.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Sweet, one of Collins\u2019 Democratic challengers in the 2020 race, delivered a petition to Collins\u2019 Portland office with over 1,200 signatures demanding she push for the FBI to reopen its investigation into Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cWhat Susan Collins did is just another slap in the face to women who feel they aren\u2019t believed or taken seriously,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cNo one\u2019s forgotten. ... This is still so raw for them.\u201d", "description": "Many felt betrayed by the senator, and they\u2019re taking action ahead of next year\u2019s election.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b761b200000d0024ec168.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
