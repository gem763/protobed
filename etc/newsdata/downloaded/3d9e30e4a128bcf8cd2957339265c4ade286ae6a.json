Man to man, me and him,' the 32-year-old centre-half told The Telegraph.\n\n'His ideas of football were different to mine. We just agreed: 'OK, we move on'. In an honest way, in a mature way.\n\n'We played together, we won together. We won the Champions League, the Europa League, everything together. It was done in a mature way.'\n\nLuiz revealed he made the move due to having different football ideas to boss Frank Lampard\n\nDAVID LUIZ THIS SEASON Appearances: 8 Goals: 1 Clean sheets: 2 Wins: 4\n\nThe flamboyant defender also revelealed that he bought into Unai Emery's vision at Arsenal which pursuaded him to join the North London club.\n\nHe added: 'The more you win, the more you believe, the more it becomes easier.\n\n'It starts to become automatic.

This is natural.\n\n'I came here because I see they have the potential to do that, to fight for that. This is my mentality, this is my ambition, this is what I want in this club.\n\n'We have the potential. We have talented players, experienced players, a team with quality, a club where they give us all the conditions to fight. We have amazing support.
