He competed in the 1970s and \u201980s, when the practice began.\n\nUntil then, men relied on their chalked hands . But in the 1970s, as routines became more challenging, they needed to find a better way to hang on. Gymnasts were doing swings under the parallel bar that required a strong grip, like giants (when a gymnast begins in a handstand position then swings under the bars and back into a handstand).\n\nThe move toward stickiness can be traced to men on the Soviet Union teams, Williams said, although they didn\u2019t actually use honey. It was too expensive and scarce in the homeland. To get sticky, they concocted a combination of boiling water and sugar.\n\nWilliams credits Bart Conner, who won two gold medals at the 1984 Olympics, with giving the Soviet approach an American twist.\n\n\u201cConnor took a Coke can and just sprinkled it on there,\u201d said Williams, who is also the men\u2019s head coach at the University of Oklahoma. \u201cThe sugar was sticky when it dried.\u201d\n\nOthers experimented with corn syrup, the most popular being Karo. By the mid-1980s, the transition was complete: from sugar to corn syrup to honey.", "description": "Honey will be a critical tool for many of the gymnasts at the world championships this week.
