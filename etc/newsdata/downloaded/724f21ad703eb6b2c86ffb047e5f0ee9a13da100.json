(Morteza Akhoondi/Tasnim News Agency/AP)\n\nThe vessel appeared to remain anchored off the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas on Monday afternoon, according to shipping tracking data. An Iranian maritime official said late Sunday that the ship would soon be released but that the case against the vessel would proceed and the results of the investigation would be announced, Iranian media reported.\n\nThe move to release the Stena Impero comes amid a brewing confrontation between Iran and the United States, following a brazen attack on oil installations in Saudi Arabia earlier this month, an operation that U.S. officials have blamed on Iran.\n\nA swarm of weaponized drones and guided cruise missiles targeted facilities belonging to the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, forcing it to suspend half its production. Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are aligned with Iran, claimed responsibility. But U.S. and Saudi officials said Houthi fighters lacked the capability to carry out such a complex attack.\n\nThe decision to free the vessel also follows Gibraltar\u2019s move last month to release the Iranian supertanker it held for more than 40 days. Authorities in the British overseas territory said last month that they had received assurances from Iranian officials that the vessel\u2019s cargo \u2014 2.1 million barrels of light crude oil \u2014 would not travel to Syria, where the government remains under E.U. sanctions.\n\nThe tanker, however, is now anchored in the Mediterranean off the Syrian port city Tartus. It is unclear whether it has unloaded its cargo.\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "A government spokesman confirmed that the Stena Impero, held for more than two months, was free to leave.", "authors": ["Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9gwmpcLtTvKu-oebDEEzVRcAFbE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7XAR55W6A4I6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
