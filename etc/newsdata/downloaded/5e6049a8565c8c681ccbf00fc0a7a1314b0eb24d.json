Iowa\u2019s of course the first. And so that\u2019s where a lot of our focus is going to go.\u201d\n\nGrass-roots organizing is essential to a strong caucus finish. Word of mouth about a candidate is often what turns people out on a cold February night. The Buttigieg campaign, which opened its bus tour to live-tweeting journalists in an effort to set itself apart, is also road-testing a somewhat novel approach to organizing. Its Iowa volunteers first contact friends and family members rather than cold-calling lists of registered voters, who are now so bombarded they ignore unknown numbers.", "description": "The Midwest mayor is making an appeal to rural voters and hoping a massive ground game delivers a top-tier caucus finish.", "authors": ["Trip Gabriel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/multimedia/00iowa-pete-02-promo/00iowa-pete-02-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
