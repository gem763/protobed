And then they get to charge you,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe next time anybody goes before these committees, the words \u2018I plead the Fifth, invoke the Fifth,\u2019 because you don\u2019t have to incriminate yourself,\u201d said Hannity. \u201cAnd God forbid if you just happen to say one little itsy bitsy thing that didn\u2019t match exactly what you said one of the other 14 times you\u2019ve been there, well then they\u2019re going to say perjury and then you got that mess in your life.\u201d\n\nCheck out the audio here:", "description": "The Fox News host issued some tips for how Trump's allies can avoid perjuring themselves.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8332ac2400002e2a7e0f1d.jpeg?cache=wocngjtr8a&ops=1778_1000"}
