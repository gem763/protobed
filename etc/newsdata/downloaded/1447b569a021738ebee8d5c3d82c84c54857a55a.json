Lamela may be joined among the substitutes by Giovani Lo Celso and Christian Eriksen, ensuring Pochettino has plenty of creativity on which to call if required.\n\nManchester United (vs Norwich)\n\nDavid De Gea will likely be fit to play for Manchester United, who appear likely to continue to be without Paul Pogba.\n\nAshley Young did not travel to Serbia but will almost certainly start at left-back, with the semi-successful three at the back formation of last weekend likely not to get another outing against a very different opponent.\n\nThe return of Anthony Martial is welcome for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Either the Frenchman or Marcus Rashford could start as the central prong of what looks a dangerous front three.", "description": "The\u00a0Premier League\u2018s big six are back in action after midweek European adventures.
