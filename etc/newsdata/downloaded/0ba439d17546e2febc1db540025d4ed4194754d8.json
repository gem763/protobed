She told the couple: \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t found SOS.\u201d\n\nThe royal couple were also given friendship bracelets from children - a blue one for the Duke, and pink for the Duchess.", "description": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge returned to a children's orphanage during their royal tour to Pakistan at her request after their flight was grounded by a storm.", "authors": ["Ben Farmer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/royal-family/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213466659-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7EsKzdzD-zFNWFmlEgY55SU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
