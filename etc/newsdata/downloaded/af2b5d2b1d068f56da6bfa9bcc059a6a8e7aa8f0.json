But the mood is upbeat,\u201d one female protester told AFP.\n\nSome protested against the police\u2019s actions by lying in the road, contributing to Tuesday\u2019s 152 arrest tally.\n\nDemonstrations occurred in 60 cities around the world this week, with thousands taking to the streets of New Delhi, Cape Town, Paris, Vienna, Madrid, and Buenos Aires.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is demanding that governments drastically cut carbon emissions.\n\nThey are backed by Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager whose searing UN address in September made international headlines, and by academics studying the rising temperatures and sea levels.\n\nThe movement is partially credited with pushing the UK government in June to become the first in the Europe Union to commit itself to a net-zero target for harmful emissions by 2050.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is demanding governments reach that target by 2025, as well as holding \u201ccitizens assemblies\u201d to decide on policies.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "British police on Tuesday began clearing central London streets blocked by climate protests, cutting demonstrators out of their tents and restricting them to tourist landmark Trafalgar Square.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/London-police.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
