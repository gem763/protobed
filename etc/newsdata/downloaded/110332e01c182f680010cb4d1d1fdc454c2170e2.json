My life is over \u2026 he took away my life,\u201d said a tearful Xolisile Mpungose.\n\nShe was testifying in aggravation of Sbusiso Mpungose\u2019s (44) sentencing. He has pleaded guilty to killing Kuhlekonke (four), Khwezi (six), Siphesihle (10) and his step-daughter Ayakha Jiyane (17) on September 3, in Wyebank, Pinetown.\n\nHe said he hired a taxi and fetched his biological children from their respective schools and took them home where he killed them. He then went to the eldest child\u2019s school and they both boarded a taxi. He decided to jump off and took her to a secluded spot where he strangled her.\n\nXolisile is a teacher and is currently on incapacity leave.\n\n\u201cI see kids everyday. My colleagues and I were raising our children together. At the moment, I can\u2019t face all of that,\u201d she said.\n\nTo make things worse, she said she can\u2019t attend therapy groups because too many people recognise her from finding out about the murders from the media. Her house in Pinetown is empty. \u201cI can\u2019t go back there. I\u2019m staying with my mother.\u201d\n\nDescribing the relationship with her husband, she said that three months after they started dating, she found out he was getting a divorce and that he had a son, who is now 18 years old and awaiting being sentenced. She did not elaborate on this.\n\nThe woman said that in 2010, her husband lost his job. Ever since then things have been difficult and he was \u201cin and out of temporary jobs\u201d. In 2016, he got a permanent job, but his salary was less than before and she had to take on most of the financial responsibilities.\n\nAccording to the husband\u2019s plea explanation, he killed the children because he believed his wife was being unfaithful to him with the father of her first child.\n\nThe woman rejected this as false.\n\nShe said her husband did not like that her eldest daughter was in contact with her father, with whom she had started communicating last year.\n\nShe said her husband became emotionally abusive. They were unhappy for a long time and she decided to divorce him. The arrangement was that she would stay in the house with the children and they would share custody.\n\nThe day he killed them was the day he was supposed to move out.\n\nUnder cross-examination she said her husband had always been a loving and \u201chands-on\u201d father. There was no physical abuse.\n\nHis attorney said that the husband had not come to terms with the seriousness of what he has done. He is in disbelief.\n\nSentencing has been adjourned provisionally to October 30.", "description": "The woman whose four children were killed by her husband on Thursday gave heart wrenching testimony in the Pietermaritzburg high court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9490/eecf7bf67ce54bbbaffeb5c54b20c85d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
