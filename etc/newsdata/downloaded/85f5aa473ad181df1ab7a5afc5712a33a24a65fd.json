I am also ready and prepared for the next season\u2026\u2019\n\nWhile not much is known about the character\u2019s story arc, the latest trailer made it look as though there\u2019s tension between Gunnhild and her man Bjorn (Alexander Ludwig).\n\nIvar The Boneless is trying to take power of his lands once again with the help of the Rus army, and it looks as though the pressure is getting to his big brother.\n\nSo much so he\u2019s starting to make mistakes \u2013 which could be threatening the safety of Kattegat.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWhen finding some alone time with his girl, Gunny seems to be let down by her king, as she tells him: \u2018You are a great man. But even great men make mistakes.\u2019\n\nAnd it looks as though there\u2019s another great man on his way to Kattegat as Harald can be seen wearing a crown.\n\nThe warrior has been desperate to be crowned King of Norway ever since he entered the show back in season four.\n\nWhile toying with the idea when talking to Hvitserk (Marco Ils\u00f8) and Rollo (Clive Standen) it looks as though his dream has finally come true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough he has been recognised as York\u2019s ruler, we\u2019re yet to see him in a crown, and the new trailer shows the fierce warrior sporting some pretty shiny headwear.\n\nYes, there\u2019s a new king in town, and despite coming to Bjorn\u2019s side in the previous season, we can\u2019t help but feel the son of Ragnar needs to be afraid.\n\nVikings season six will drop onto the History Channel and Amazon Prime 4 December.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
