Plus, \u201cThe Next Chapter\u201d feels particularly official because the audio version is narrated by Tatiana Maslany, whose starring turn as the show\u2019s various clones was so central to its appeal.\n\nSo for a bonus episode of the Original Content podcast, I spoke to Malka Older, the head writer of \u201cOrphan Black: The Next Chapter.\u201d\n\nOlder was a fan of the series, and she explained that by jumping several years ahead in the \u201cOrphan Black\u201d timeline, the writing team could \u201cgive the original series space to breathe\u201d and find a new approach to its big themes.\n\nWhile Older noted that she has no problem depicting large corporations as villains \u2014 something she\u2019s done in her own novels \u2014 she wanted to do something new here:\n\nWe started thinking more about governments. And particularly when you come to these questions of biotechnology and genetics, governments are increasingly getting involved and trying to figure out what their role is in regulating them \u2014 or facilitating them for economic reasons. And then we\u2019re also seeing security questions and things like biometric security become much more pervasive. So to start thinking about how that would effect the lives of these clones was just a really rich seam to open up.\n\nWe also cover some topics that should be interesting to non-\u201cOrphan Black\u201d fans, like the appeal of serialized fiction versus binge-watching. Older noted that if you wait for all the weekly installments to come out, you can still binge \u201cThe Next Chapter,\u201d but she also said, \u201cNot all of us have the opportunity to really binge everything. And it\u2019s not always bad to have structural constraints on how much you can consume at one time.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to the interview in the player below, subscribe using Apple Podcasts or find us in your podcast player of choice.
