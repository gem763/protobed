It named assistant football coach Kenneth Dorsey as Jones' interim replacement.\n\nSt. Augustine High School President and CEO Kenneth St. Charles said the decision to replace Jones came after carefully reviewing the school's football program.\n\n\u201cFollowing a review of our football program, we have decided to go in a new direction,\u201d said St. Charles said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe thank Coach Jones for his contributions and service to St. Augustine and our football team. \"", "description": "A Louisiana high school fired its head football coach on Tuesday after video showed him leading players in a locker room chant that included the n-word.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/augustine-football2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
