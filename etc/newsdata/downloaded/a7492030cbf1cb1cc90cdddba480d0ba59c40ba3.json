Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenues (12.9% of sales) surged 34.7% year over year to $8.99 billion.\n\n\n\nYear-over-year top-line growth was driven by solid momentum across Prime on account of strong performance of Amazon\u2019s free one-day delivery service and expanding Prime Video content. Further, strengthening Amazon Web Services (AWS) services and smart home products offerings contributed to the company\u2019s third-quarter results.\n\n\n\nHowever, shares of Amazon have plunged 5.7% in the pre-market trading, which can be attributed to unimpressive guidance for this holiday season.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s accelerating transportation and fulfillment center costs related to fast delivery services remains an overhang.
