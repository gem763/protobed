Leon Neal/Pool via REUTERS\n\nThe so-called Queen\u2019s Speech is the highlight of a day of elaborate pageantry in Westminster and is used to detail all the bills the government wants to enact in the coming year. It is written for the 93-year old monarch by the government.\n\nBut, with Brexit in the balance before a crucial week of talks, and an unpredictable election likely in the near future, rival parties said Johnson was misusing the politically-neutral queen by asking her to set out his election agenda.\n\nThe speech and accompanying notes set out an overview of more than 20 bills, including the legislation that is required to implement a Brexit deal - if Johnson is able to reach agreement with the EU this week. [L5N26Z25O]\n\n\u201cMy government\u2019s priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on 31 October,\u201d the queen said from parliament\u2019s gilded House of Lords debating chamber.\n\n\u201cMy government intends to work towards a new partnership with the European Union, based on free trade and friendly cooperation\u201d.\n\nThe government\u2019s plans included an outline of Johnson\u2019s proposed post-Brexit immigration system, criminal justice reforms, healthcare changes, and a promise to invest more from the public purse to stimulate growth.\n\n\u201cPeople are tired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change,\u201d Johnson said in a written statement accompanying the speech. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t want to wait any longer to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s political future and his ability to implement any of this agenda is highly uncertain. He runs a minority government and has been unable to win a single vote in parliament since taking power in July.\n\nAll parties want an early election, but disagree over when it should be held.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party said the queen was being used to promote a Conservative Party election manifesto.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got in effect is a party political broadcast from the steps of the throne,\u201d Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a Sky News interview broadcast on Sunday.\n\nThe speech is now subject to several days of debate, concluding with votes to approve it. While not an official vote of confidence, these could be used to further destabilise Johnson\u2019s position.", "description": "Queen Elizabeth set out Prime Minister Boris Johnson's agenda for his government on Monday, including an Oct. 31 Brexit, a new deal with the European Union, and a host of domestic policies designed to win over voters ahead of an expected election.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440657229&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0OH", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
