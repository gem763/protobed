A new website lets everyone listen.", "language": "en", "text": "With that begins the tour, which will stretch for roughly 90 minutes and take attendees through the history and legacy of Charlottesville\u2019s embattled Confederate monuments.\n\n\u201cObjects in our public space \u2026 are meant to do something. Your body is supposed to act in relationship to those objects,\u201d Douglas told a crowd in June. \u201cThat is part of the power of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor instance, you walk across here and you would miss it,\u201d Schmidt chimed in. \u201cYou have to literally look down in order to see it.\u201d\n\nThe women always begin their tour \u2014 which includes stops at statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson \u2014 at the auction block. That\u2019s so the narrative will remain \u201ccentered around the humanity of black people whose lives were torn apart by the Confederacy,\u201d Schmidt said in an interview.\n\nCharlottesville's Confederate statues still stand \u2014 and still symbolize a racist legacy\n\nThe duo began leading the guided walks, which cost nothing and usually take place on Saturday mornings, about a year ago, inspired by the ongoing legal fight over the city\u2019s plans to remove the Lee and Jackson statues. Both women, who perform the tours in their free time and without pay, wanted to ensure that the public knew the full historical context surrounding the monuments.\n\nAs the women advertised the tour through word of mouth and on social media over the past few months, interest swelled \u2014 the most recent tour drew more than 100 attendees, a record. But the audience was always limited to those in Charlottesville and to those able to physically participate.\n\nThat changed last week when WTJU, a community radio station owned and operated by the University of Virginia, published a website, \u201cMarked by These Monuments,\u201d that re-creates Schmidt and Douglas\u2019s tour free online, complete with maps, audio clips and pictures of the two women. Internet users across the country can listen as Schmidt explains who installed each monument and why. And they can hear Douglas reflect on the statues\u2019 artistic, cultural and social value (the \u201ctypical division of labor,\u201d Douglas said).\n\n\u201cI wanted to make [the tour] more accessible to those who can\u2019t come in person,\u201d said Nathan Moore, the general manager of WTJU, who came up with the idea a few months ago. \u201cOur mission is to bring people together through excellent music and conversation. This monuments project is a perfect fit.\u201d\n\nThe site\u2019s debut was timed to coincide with the anniversary of the August 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville that left one woman, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, dead and dozens of people injured.\n\nIt also comes as the city\u2019s Confederate monuments continue to provoke heated legal battle: In April, a judge ruled that the monuments qualify as war memorials, meaning they cannot be removed or altered. Litigation will go forward in the coming months.\n\nOnce Moore proposed the project, things came together quickly, he said. After Schmidt and Douglas signed on, Moore and recent University of Virginia graduate Mary Garner McGehee, then an intern at WTJU, lugged audio equipment to downtown Charlottesville. The pair followed close behind the two women for several hours during what turned out to be a very rainy Saturday in June.\n\nThough the downpour \u201cseverely tested\u201d McGehee\u2019s recording skills, everything came out fine, she said. She spent the next month and a half cutting the hours-long tape into bite-size segments for the website. She also produced a handful of 21-minute reports that WTJU is airing throughout the summer. (McGehee\u2019s work on the project later helped win her a job at WTJU, Moore said.)\n\nIn total, the whole thing cost about $100, according to Moore, and was covered by the radio station\u2019s budget. McGehee, who has no background in coding, cobbled together the site using the website planning platform Squarespace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what we put together. \u2026 The tour is a fantastic resource,\u201d McGehee said. \u201cIt really gives this deep story of the entire community after the Civil War, and how white folks put so much effort into entrenching a certain narrative.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate that effort, Schmidt focuses on moments like a speech delivered by the president of the University of Virginia on Oct. 19, 1921. As he stood before a crowd of thousands, poised to unveil the statue of Jackson posed in triumph atop a horse, Edwin A. Alderman invoked the \u201cvaliant souls\u201d who fought on behalf of the Confederacy.\n\nHe declared that dubbing Confederate soldiers actions\u2019 treason \u201cis to add viciousness to stupidity.\u201d Schmidt often mentions this comment when she performs the tour.\n\nA Virginia teen saw a historic black cemetery in disrepair. He recruited his fellow Boy Scouts to restore it.\n\n\u201cTo put it bluntly, these statues have been lying to us since the moment they were installed,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThese statues were meant to erase history. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important I present to the public what were the intentions of those folks who were putting these in.\u201d\n\nOver the past several years, Schmidt spent a lot of time in the library, digging through old newspaper records to uncover remarks like Alderman\u2019s. Slavery and its legacy in the United States are not something she normally studies: Her area of expertise is Latin America, its slaveholding past, politics and religion.\n\nDouglas trained as a historian of African and African diaspora art and at one point was contemporary art curator at the university museum. She said she is also wading outside her typical scholarly waters. The women are \u201ccoming at this from multiple perspectives, and not necessarily the ones that we\u2019re trained in,\u201d Douglas admitted.\n\nBut they have something more important, Schmidt said: passion for their subject. She began researching the monuments\u2019 installation after growing frustrated with some residents\u2019 behavior during public hearings the city held in the spring of 2016 to discuss the statues\u2019 removal.\n\n\u201cWhen I started going, it was mainly old white folks who said: \u2018Keep the statues! I\u2019m not racist, they\u2019re not racist! Also, slavery was not that bad,\u2019 \u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI started studying so I would have arguments to rebut these people.\u201d\n\n'We cannot be forgetting': Twilight marchers in Alexandria evoke the pain of enslaved thousands\n\nAbout three years later, she and Douglas often stare into a sea of white faces as they lead tours, Schmidt said. Tour groups \u2014 which include a wide smattering of people such as other historians, high school teachers and students, journalists, families, and couples \u2014 are not especially racially diverse, according to Schmidt.\n\nShe appreciates everyone who takes the time to listen, Schmidt said, especially the repeat tour-takers. But she wants individuals of all races to participate: \u201cThis is all to increase the empathy of the public, and I want to reach the broadest swath of people possible.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something the website may help with, given that it exponentially expands the women\u2019s reach, Schmidt said. Both Schmidt and Douglas said they are pleased their words will remain online, available to all, forever.\n\nBut \u2014 if possible \u2014 come in person, Douglas said.\n\n\u201cAs we learn new information, we bring it to the tour, or she says something that causes me to think about something I didn\u2019t say the last time,\u201d Douglas said, referring to Schmidt. \u201cSo it\u2019s never the same tour twice.\u201d", "description": "Two black historians began leading the guided walks, which usually take place on Saturday evenings, about a year ago, inspired by the ongoing legal fight over the city\u2019s plans to remove the Lee and Jackson statues.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
