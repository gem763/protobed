Trump asks as Biden's son says he will leave China role", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d Donald Trump asked on Sunday, referring to the son of former vice-president Joe Biden.\n\nTrump impeachment: Esper indicates Pentagon will cooperate with inquiry Read more\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s business interests overseas sit at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump, who has admitted asking foreign powers to investigate.\n\n\u201cHe has totally disappeared!\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday, adding without evidence the claim it \u201cnow looks like [Biden] has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the media swarmed to an internet post written by Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, which said the 49-year-old would step down from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity firm at the end of the month, as part of a pledge not to work on behalf of any foreign-owned companies should his father win the White House.\n\nThe post written by attorney George Mesires outlined a defence of the younger Biden\u2019s work with companies in Ukraine and China, which have emerged as one of Trump\u2019s chief lines of attack against his father despite no proof of impropriety in either case.\n\nHunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue George Mesires\n\n\u201cHunter makes the following commitment,\u201d Mesires wrote. \u201cUnder a Biden administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests.\n\n\u201cIn any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies.\n\nHe continued: \u201cHe will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs, while availing himself as necessary and appropriate to the Office of the White House Counsel to help inform his application of the Biden administration\u2019s guidelines or standards to his business decision-making.\u201d\n\nLast month, the White House released a transcript of a 25 July call in which Trump asks Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Biden\u2019s family and Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 US election. The question of whether the call involved a quid pro quo for frozen US military aid weighs heavily on impeachment proceedings.\n\nTrump has also asked China to dig into Hunter Biden\u2019s work in that country, asserting without evidence that he earned $1.5bn from a \u201csweetheart\u201d business deal there.\n\nThe president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is also under increasing scrutiny for his efforts to dig into Hunter Biden\u2019s background. Late last week, two businessmen who played key roles in Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine were charged with federal campaign finance violations.\n\nJoe Biden is a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to face Trump next year, although he has lost considerable ground to the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nI think this is just another way to save a flailing campaign that\u2019s going down Doug Collins\n\nRepublicans reacted to news of Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to step away from the Chinese-backed company with deep skepticism.\n\n\u201cI think this is just another way to save a flailing campaign that\u2019s going down,\u201d Georgia representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, told Sunday Morning Futures, on Fox News. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s in trouble and this is just another way to try and detract attention.\u201d\n\nWhite House counsellor Kellyanne Conway told the same show Hunter Biden \u201cshould have done this quite a while ago\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a part of how Donald Trump won in the first place saying that we\u2019re going to get rid of these sweetheart deals, we\u2019re going to make sure that we clean up the axis of power in a place like Washington DC where someone like Hunter Biden get a $50,000 a month retainer for Ukrainian energy company when everybody knows that he doesn\u2019t have that skill set.\u201d\n\nOne of Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic presidential rivals noted, however, that Trump\u2019s children are openly trading on his name in business deals around the world.\n\nHunter Biden is a reminder: Democrats are morally corrupt, too | Hamilton Nolan Read more\n\n\u201cI think [Hunter Biden\u2019s move] demonstrates the difference in standards relative to the White House,\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union.\n\n\u201cI mean, here you have Hunter Biden stepping down from a position in order to make sure, even though there\u2019s been no accusation of wrongdoing, doing something just to make sure there\u2019s not even the appearance of a conflict of interests, while, in the White House, the president of the United States is a walking conflict of interests.\u201d\n\nMesires noted repeatedly that there is no evidence of wrongdoing against his client.\n\n\u201cDespite extensive scrutiny, at no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term [in business in Ukraine],\u201d Mesires wrote.\n\nOf Biden\u2019s work related to China, the attorney said: \u201cTo date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\u2019s board of directors. He has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s son issues statement regarding work at heart of impeachment furore, including former role in Ukraine", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06751bc33375e9fa4e7cbcbe29984ea93133fa2b/0_83_2589_1554/master/2589.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e97e25f3f7973d2734e001b382bdc32f", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
