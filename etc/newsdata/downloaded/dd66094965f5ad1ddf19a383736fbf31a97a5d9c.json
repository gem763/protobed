Add Recalls as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Recalls news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn the latest case, detailed on Monday, Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited expanded its voluntary recall for losartan potassium tablets and the combination medication, losartan potassium/ hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Other lots of losartan as well as other drugs from several manufacturers have been recalled voluntarily in recent months as well due to contamination from other chemicals.\n\nThe drugs from Torrent, with lot numberslisted on the FDA website were believed to be contaminated with \"unacceptable\" amounts of N-methylnitrosobutyric acid or NMBA, a potential human carcinogen.\n\nLosartan, a blood pressure medication in the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) class, helps reduce blood pressure by preventing blood vessels from narrowing or constricting.\n\nA rep at Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited said that \"no adverse events have been reported yet.\"\n\nPer the FDA website, people taking these medications are encouraged to continue taking their medication \"as the risk of harm to the patient\u2019s health may be higher if the treatment is stopped immediately without any alternative treatment.\" They are asked to consult their physicians or pharmacists before making any changes to their medication regimen.\n\nTorrent Pharmaceuticals Limited said it suspects that contamination is related to manufacturing at a specific site and is therefore working on \"manufacturing and distributing new pills without the contaminant.\"\n\nThe rep urged that anyone who is taking these medications should call Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-888-280-2040. The company has shared that they will take back contaminated medications and provide refunds.\n\nFDA has recalled multiple blood pressure medications\n\nOver the past year, the FDA has recalled multiple blood pressure medications from several manufacturers after discovering potential carcinogens in some batches. It\u2019s believed they became contaminated during the manufacturing process.\n\nThe recalled medications include specific \u201clots\u201d of losartan, irbesartan, valsartan and combination drugs with valsartan. The investigation is ongoing and the FDA continues to update the list of medications being recalled here.\n\nSome of the recalled lots contain a combination of medications. Although neither amlodipine nor hydrochlorothiazide are currently under recall on their own, they are when combined with some other medications. For example, a combination of valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide is one product that has been recalled. The FDA website provides lists of valsartan products under recall, valsartan products not under recall, irbesartan products under recall and losartan medications under recall for patients, health care providers and pharmacists to accurately confirm which products are affected.\n\nFDA\n\nThose voluntary recalls came after the discovery of the chemicals NDMA and NDEA -- both probable human carcinogens -- at levels far above what the FDA considers an acceptable daily intake. NDEA is a naturally occurring chemical in some foods and it can be found in drinking water, but it\u2019s also present in air pollution and industrial processes. NDMA is a chemical that forms in both industrial and natural processes.\n\nWith that said, here are some things you should know if you\u2019re taking these medications.:\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t stop taking the medication until you speak to your doctor first.\n\nTo date, none of the manufacturers have received any reports of people who use these medications becoming ill. If you\u2019re taking a blood pressure medication that was recently recalled, do not stop taking it.\n\nThe FDA says that \u201cthe risk of harm to someone\u2019s health may be higher if one of these medications is stopped immediately without any alternative treatment.\u201d\n\nSo, if you\u2019re taking one of these medications, reach out to your pharmacist or physician to discuss alternative treatments.\n\nThese medications will lower your risk for heart disease.\n\nThese medications are for high blood pressure and fall in a drug class known as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). They work by blocking the production of a natural hormone called angiotensin II, which narrow your arteries, raising blood pressure. High blood pressure, which is also called hypertension, causes stress on your heart and can contribute to heart disease.\n\nHigh blood pressure affects 75 million American adults.\n\nHigh blood pressure is one of the most common medical conditions. Blood pressure is a measure of how efficiently our hearts push blood through our arteries. If the pressure is too low, there is a risk that organs will not get enough blood. If the pressure is too high, there\u2019s a risk that the heart will work too hard.\n\nNormal blood pressure fluctuates.\n\nBlood pressure measurements are actually two measurements: systolic, which is when the heart squeezes blood through the body, and diastolic, which is the pressure of blood when the heart is at rest.\n\nIf your doctor says your blood pressure is 130/80, the 130 would be systolic and the 80 would be diastolic.\n\nWhile your target blood pressure is often determined by your age and medical conditions, most doctors recommend keeping it around 120/80.\n\nSeveral reasons people get high blood pressure and why it\u2019s normal for it to fluctuate\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that your blood pressure measurement will vary throughout the day; it\u2019s normal. High blood pressure can develop for several reasons, including having a family history, obesity, smoking, high-salt diets, diabetes, lack of exercise and underlying kidney disease. Often, it can be controlled with a combination of lifestyle modifications and a variety of medications.\n\nTulsie N.
