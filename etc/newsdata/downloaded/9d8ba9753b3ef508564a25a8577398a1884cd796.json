USA TODAY\n\nJennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez gave back in a big way to an East Tennessee elementary school.\n\nThe celebrity couple was \"so moved\" after hearing about the need that they donated a year's worth of food to Jacksboro Elementary School's food pantry, according to Instagram posts.\n\nTheir donation comes after a viral Facebook post from Brooke Goins, a teacher at the school, who wrote about a student who needed food and how she and a group of teachers pooled their money to buy him some.\n\nJ.Lo: 'We were so touched'\n\nLopez posted a video Wednesday on Instagram showing the elementary school receiving the food and video chatting with Goins and her class.\n\n\"We were so touched. We were so moved. ... Oh my God. We were crying,\" Lopez said in the video. \"You know my mom was a teacher, and it was such a moving story to us that we wanted to help.\"\n\nIn her post, Goins talked about how she and the other teachers rallied together.\n\n\"Well here is where it gets even better, I immediately sent a text to my group, these are the people who are teachers,\" Goins wrote in the post. \"Remember hearing people say that we spend all of our money in our classrooms? We spend it to make sure that our kids have what they need to succeed, and today we bought food. Yep, we put our money together and made sure that this sweet baby had some Spaghetti O\u2019s! ...\"\n\nGoins' post has racked up 40,000 shares since she posted on Oct. 2, and since then, the school started a food pantry for its students.\n\n\"We are now starting a food pantry for our students,\" wrote Goins. \"Students will be able to get food whenever needed! If you would like to help, we are accepting food donations as well as hygiene products! 164 Jacksboro Elementary School Road, Jacksboro, TN 37757. You can put attention FOOD PANTRY.\"\n\nLopez and Rodriguez donated food from a company they are involved with called Tiller & Hatch, according to Instagram posts.\n\n\"This is why being a business owner, and having actual ownership in companies (not licensing), is so important to me and Alex, especially as Latinos. It's about showing our community, this is what life can be. You can take charge and take ownership. It allows us to have a say in creating things that make people's lives better and have partners that share our passion for giving back. Because giving back and being there for others is really what matters most \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f,\" wrote Lopez on Instagram.\n\n\"We are happy to be in business with partners who also believe no child should EVER have to go to sleep hungry. Everyone should have access to delicious, nutritious food. This was my favorite moment of the month and it\u2019s one of the best things we\u2019ve been able to do. @tillerandhatch #tillerandhatch\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/24/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-donate-food-tennessee-school/4085987002/", "description": "Jennifer Lopez and\u00a0Alex Rodriguez donated a year's worth of food to\u00a0Jacksboro Elementary School's food pantry.", "authors": ["Maggie Jones", "Published P.M.
