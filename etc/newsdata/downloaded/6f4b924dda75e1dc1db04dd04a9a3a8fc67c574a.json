(David Pitt/AP)\n\nWhen a Des Moines Register reporter on Tuesday helped expose racist tweets posted years ago by a local man who used his viral Internet fame to raise millions for a children\u2019s hospital, it inspired a vicious backlash against \u201ccancel culture\u201d \u2014 and the reporter himself, who critics soon found had his own history of offensive posts.\n\nThe Register announced late Thursday that the reporter, Aaron Calvin, no longer works for the newspaper. The move comes as the Register has hired extra security under a deluge of threats from people furious about its decision to pursue the story.\n\nCarol Hunter, the Register\u2019s executive editor, announced Thursday that, after the backlash, the newspaper was reexamining both its procedures for reviewing employees\u2019 social media accounts and its internal policies for how to report on the backgrounds of profile subjects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re revising our policies and practices, including those that did not uncover our own reporter\u2019s past inappropriate social media postings,\u201d she wrote in a column. \u201cWe took appropriate action because there is nothing more important in journalism than having readers\u2019 trust.\u201d\n\nThe case revolved around Carson King, a 24-year-old casino security guard who gained unexpected fame after he appeared in the background of ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d on Sept. 14 holding a sign requesting donations for his \u201cBusch Light Supply.\u201d When strangers quickly sent him more than $600 on Venmo, he decided instead to donate the money to a local children\u2019s hospital. Soon, Anheuser-Busch and Venmo announced matching donations as his fundraising topped $1 million.\n\nThat\u2019s when the Register began working on a profile, and Calvin learned of two racist tweets King had sent when he was 16 years old. Before the newspaper could publish its profile, though, King held a news conference Tuesday evening apologizing for the racist jokes and revealing that Anheuser-Busch had cut ties with him. King said Calvin had brought the tweets to his attention, though he said he didn\u2019t blame the newspaper.\n\n[Iowa reporter who found a viral star\u2019s racist tweets slammed when critics find his own offensive posts]\n\nOnline vitriol quickly built against both the Register and Calvin on Tuesday evening, even before the Register published its largely positive profile of King. Critics upset with Calvin for surfacing the old tweets dug into the reporter\u2019s own timeline and found troubling posts that mocked same-sex marriage, made light of abuse against women and used a racial slur.\n\nCalvin began deleting the old tweets Tuesday evening and then apologized.\n\n\u201cHey just wanted to say that I have deleted previous tweets that have been inappropriate or insensitive,\u201d he wrote in a tweet that has since been erased. \u201cI apologize for not holding myself to the same high standards as the Register holds others.\u201d\n\nThe reporter locked his Twitter account Tuesday evening as angry messages flooded his mentions.\n\nThe newspaper also faced harsh criticism, leading Hunter to explain late on Tuesday that the paper\u2019s editors had debated whether to report on King\u2019s old tweets and eventually decided to include them low in the profile. The paper later clarified that Anheuser-Busch learned independently of King\u2019s tweets and not from the Register\u2019s reporting.\n\nOn Wednesday, Des Moines police said they were monitoring threats against the newspaper.\n\n\u201cWe are certainly aware of some of the threats they\u2019ve had. They made a report to the police department so that goes on our radar as a place we are going to want to give a little extra attention to,\u201d Des Moines police Sgt. Paul Parizek told WHO TV. Parizek said the newspaper hired an off-duty officer to provide additional security outside of the newsroom.\n\nAlthough the bulk of criticism blamed the newspaper for allegedly trying to \u201ccancel\u201d or tarnish King\u2019s fundraiser, coverage of the tweets and the ensuing backlash have spurred more businesses to support his cause. A number of businesses stood by King, and some even increased their donations to Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital at the University of Iowa. Venmo kept its promise to match King\u2019s fundraiser through Monday. And even though the company decided not to proceed with plans to put King\u2019s face on its cans, Anheuser-Busch honored the more than $350,000 it had pledged to the hospital.\n\n\u201cNone of what\u2019s happened has slowed King\u2019s fundraising for the children\u2019s hospital,\u201d Hunter said in her Thursday column. \u201cWe can all agree that\u2019s good news.\u201d", "description": "Online readers incensed over \"cancel culture\" got an Iowa reporter fired over his own offensive tweets.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Katie Shepherd Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
