Warren Davidson: You Have to Defend Money to Defend Freedom", "language": "en", "text": "In an interview with Cointelegraph on Friday, Oct. 18, United States Representative Warren Davidson gave his thoughts on the Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) flawed approach to regulating digital assets as well as Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s upcoming Oct. 23 testimony before the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nCongressman Davidson (R-OH) is a figure familiar to many in the crypto world for his role in authoring the Token Taxonomy Act, as well as his general optimism about the role of blockchain in the U.S.\n\nOn regulating Libra as a security\n\nWhile discussing regulating cryptocurrencies at large as opposed to Libra, Davidson was highly precise in his taxonomic definitions:\n\n\u201cWe use the term \u2018cryptocurrencies\u2019 to refer to everything in the crypto space, which is sloppy language. What we need to focus on is, what is Libra\u2019s goal? Its goal is to be a currency. Let\u2019s not conflate that with what other things in the space want to do and how we regulate them. How we look at Libra would be to apply, in my view, the Token Taxonomy litmus test.\u201d\n\nDavidson concluded that Libra is ultimately classified as a security, and therefore falls under the purview of the SEC within the United States. He explained this as being a function of the influence of a central organization over Libra\u2019s composition. It was originally planned as a \u201cbasket\u201d of currencies, though David Marcus, head of Calibra, yesterday suggested that these could instead be fiat-pegged stablecoins.\n\nSpeaking about Libra\u2019s classification as a security, Davidson said, \u201cIt has nothing to do with stablecoins. It has to do with whether there\u2019s a central authority that can alter it.\u201d The congressman was unconvinced that the planned basket of currencies would be fixed and stable, opening Libra up to the Libra Association\u2019s tampering. He ceded that SEC Chairman Clayton is correct in his assessment as to how this makes Libra a security, rather than a true currency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the ability to destroy your value,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cAnd in that sense, when you\u2019re placing all your faith in the value of that token on the actions of a central authority, that\u2019s where I tend to agree with Jay Clayton. That looks a lot like a security.\u201d\n\nElaborating on Libra\u2019s centralization, Davidson said, \u201cThe way that they proposed to do it \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s Facebook doing it \u2014 highlights to me the problem with centralized tokens.\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) came up as a comparison: \u201cWhoever Satoshi Nakamoto is, you can\u2019t serve Satoshi papers. There\u2019s no headquarters to subpoena.\u201d\n\nDavidson did credit Facebook\u2019s initial whitepaper for Libra with a rapid expansion of interest in crypto:\n\n\u201cIt was the moment that I think a lot people said, \u2018Wow this is really gonna be a thing, it\u2019s not just this wonky niche.\u2019 Facebook\u2019s talking about doing it all over the planet, this is going to scale up. It really raised the profile of blockchain. I think that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nOn the SEC\u2019s \u201cthird-world\u201d approach to crypto: regulation by enforcement\n\nDespite his desire to see Libra under the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction, Davidson was extremely critical of the commission\u2019s current regulation of digital assets. The present strategy has largely consisted of legal action against companies making moves that the SEC deems missteps:\n\n\u201cThe SEC is doing a complete patchwork of regulation. No one knows where they\u2019re going. They\u2019re literally told if you want to launch a token, whatever you think you want to do with it, come check with the SEC first. [...] And you can grovel. If you grovel well enough, then we\u2019ll give you a no-action letter. You have hundreds of companies waiting on no-action letters. They\u2019ve approved two. You can\u2019t raise capital while you\u2019re waiting for that.\u201d\n\nTelegram recently made a similar argument in response to the SEC\u2019s emergency action against the company\u2019s distribution of Gram tokens on Oct. 11. Telegram alleged that the commission had ended up facing an \u201cemergency of its own making\u201d by not doing anything in the 18 preceding months during which it was aware of Telegram\u2019s plans.\n\nDavidson blamed this strategy for a flight of capital from the U.S. to other countries. In the case of the Libra Association, that money\u2019s going to Geneva. This move drew the ire of Davidson\u2019s fellow committee members when David Marcus spoke to them in July. To Davidson, this is a search for clarity rather than anarchy:\n\n\u201cSo what are people doing? They\u2019re like,\u2019Screw you guys, we\u2019re just gonna launch it in Switzerland, Singapore, Malta \u2014 wherever.\u2019 And they\u2019re not going to avoid our laws \u2014 we don\u2019t have a law. As I told Chairman Clayton, you\u2019ve got all the charm and inefficiency of third-world power structures. Go see el jefe and maybe you can cut your own deal. That\u2019s a horrible way to regulate the economy. You do not regulate by enforcement. You regulate by passing a simple law as a uniform standard for everyone. That\u2019s easy to comply with. That\u2019s what first-world countries do.\u201d\n\nAfter the SEC hearing, Cointelegraph asked whether the next steps were in the hands of legislators in Congress or regulators like the SEC. Congressman Davidson came down on the side of legislation first.\n\nThe congressman attributed the current hold-up to the mechanics of how the SEC\u2019s commissioners operate: \u201cThey\u2019re having a debate internal to the board as to how to go forward. And frankly, part of the holdback is Chairman Clayton. He\u2019s got a lot of power and he doesn\u2019t want to give it up.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen how recent events will or won\u2019t compel other members of Congress to back the Token Taxonomy Act (or any equivalent piece of legislation). On a more optimistic note, Davidson expressed continuing hope for the future of blockchain and crypto in the United States: \u201cI believe that this is a great industry. America should be leading the world in it, we should set our framework for it.\u201d\n\nOn his hopes for the Oct. 23 committee hearing with Mark Zuckerberg\n\nWith Davidson\u2019s views on Libra\u2019s status as a security established, he elaborated on what he wants to see at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. He seemed to prefer that the hearings stick to the subject of Libra rather than reining in the company as a whole: \u201cHopefully it focuses on blockchain and this tokenized idea that they have versus just Facebook.\u201d\n\nA major concern for Davidson is the degree of control that Libra and the associated Calibra wallet will have over transactions. In his words: \u201cSome people want the wallets to filter transactions. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve got a wallet. Does your wallet filter transactions? Does your wallet say, \u2018No, you can\u2019t buy that?\u2019\u201d He continued:\n\n\u201cWould Libra itself \u2014 which is supposed to be a store of value, money, a currency, a synthetic currency, basically \u2014 would the association have any way to filter transactions? And if they do, then it\u2019s not really money, it\u2019s a system of control.\u201d\n\nIn no uncertain terms, the congressman asserted his opposition to that kind of control of consumer finances: \u201cIt\u2019s a civil liberties thing. If you\u2019re going to defend freedom, you have to defend money.\u201d", "description": "Author of the Token Taxonomy Act and member of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee Rep.
