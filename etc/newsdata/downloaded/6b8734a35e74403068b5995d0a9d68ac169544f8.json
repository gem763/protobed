'It is tough to have the camera in your office, and then it is how you handle the situation, to have the capacity to say, \"OK, I am not in a good mood but sometimes the camera is going to be there\".\n\nMauricio Pochettino admits the Amazon documentary is another problem to worry about\n\n'It is so complicated, it is another thing to worry about and of course that adds a lot. If we were busy before, now we are super-busy. To plan everything every day is not an easy job. I said before that I feel I am not a manager any more but a coach \u2014 and now I am like a producer. Being a coach, manager and producer.'\n\nIt might have been easier to handle if Spurs were in better form. Pochettino has transformed the club into Champions League regulars but this campaign, with only four wins from the first 13 games in all competitions, could yet turn into the worst since he arrived from Southampton in 2014.\n\n'It is going to be the reality like when we started the book,' said Pochettino, referring to Brave New World, part-autobiography and part-diary of the 2016-17 season when Spurs were runners-up to Chelsea in the Premier League.\n\n'It was the same risk. It is not about trying to generate something that is fake or not real. What you are going to love and what the people are going to love to see is that we are normal people working.\n\n'We can win and we can lose. Like with the book, I hope there is a happy ending but if not you are going to see another point of view.'\n\nTottenham take on pace-setters Liverpool away on Sunday afternoon in the Premier League\n\nPochettino received the tonic of a 5-0 win against Red Star Belgrade ahead of Sunday's trip to Anfield and the first clash with Liverpool since the defeat in the Champions League final in June.\n\n'The Champions League final is all or nothing and it was nothing in the end,' said Pochettino, perhaps with the title of the Amazon documentary preying on his mind. 'With time you can say, \"OK we played in the final of the Champions League\", but we didn't win and that will always be with you.'\n\nLiverpool have kicked on since they were crowned European champions for the sixth time, taking 25 points from nine Premier League games.\n\nSpurs in contrast have faltered, with Pochettino under rare scrutiny, and his players tried to lift his spirits by inviting the manager and his staff to a swanky restaurant in Mayfair on Thursday.\n\n'This sort of team-bonding makes the group stronger,' he added. 'It doesn't mean we will go to Anfield and win 5-0 but medium to long-term it will help.'", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino admits a fly-on-the-wall documentary team filming his every move is another problem to worry him in a season which has not started well.", "authors": ["Matt Barlow For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20196858-0-image-a-99_1572034510897.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
