He\u2019s said to us \u2018you guys shouldn\u2019t be here\u2019, and you know, we shouldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cFrankly, we shouldn\u2019t be. We\u2019re here because youth homelessness has not gone away\u2026 He\u2019s very keen and supportive of this scheme\u201d\n\nThis year 103,000 young people approached their councils to register as homeless. This is double the number when Centrepoint was founded in 1969.\n\nA further one in five of the young people who use the charity\u2019s services are ready to move on with their lives but are unable to due to a shortage of affordable homes, increasingly restrictive welfare policies and reductions in local authority benefits.\n\nOther obstacles include a lack of social housing, high rents and upfront costs, landlords\u2019 reluctance to let to tenants receiving benefits are all factors. People aged 25 and under also receive less financial support through the benefits system.", "description": "Hundreds of modular homes will be built by a youth homelessness charity with capped rent in the first scheme of its kind aiming to \u201cend homelessness\u201d.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social Affairs Editor", "Fraser Nelson", "Penny Mordaunt", "Tom Harris"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212616276-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BquYsoiHywuRbpECh2kaughPr7sARQy7EgBjwPUzvqL_M.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
