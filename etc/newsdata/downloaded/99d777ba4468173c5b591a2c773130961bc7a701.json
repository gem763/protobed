She had black bruises all below her bra line, on her chest, on her breasts.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/Press Association Images)\n\n\u201cI did take it in my stride because I was very naive but I do remember how horrific those bruises were. Oh put yourself away Anne.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t comprehend in my head just how bad this was. I remember her lifting her school skirt up and these horrible black bruises were inside her thighs.\n\n\u201cStraight away she made it quite clear that people were doing this to her.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, at 17, I would never got my head round it but as I\u2019ve grown up and had children and had life experience.\n\n\u201cI know that I know that those injuries were inflicted in a very abusive way.\u201d\n\nAnne Marie, who was sexually and physically abused by her vile parents from the age of eight, would eventually escape the house a few years later still unaware Fred had murdered her mum Rena and her two sisters.\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\nShe would eventually go on to bravely testify against them in court when their evil deeds were finally exposed.\n\nGill's interview was released as part of the ongoing podcast Unheard: The Fred & Rose West Tapes by author and journalist Howard Sounes.\n\nIn the interview she gives a fascinating insight into daily life inside Cromwell Street where she rented a room on the first floor of the house.\n\nShe says she often played her records loud, insulating herself from the Wests, who occupied rooms above and below but that she could not help but hear the sinister goings on at times.\n\nShe explained: \u201cMum and dad would shout from time to time but when I heard the names that she (Rose) would shout at the children like 'effing bi****' I would think woah she is a bit angry isn't she?\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\u201cMy mum would never address me at my worst using any of these words so I would think OK we won't be going down to do washing today with Rose in that kind of mood.\n\n\u201cSo there was a lot of he shouting, a lot of effing and b'ing going on and calling the children effing b***** and so on.\u201d\n\nAsked if she saw the Wests physically abusing the children she answered: \u201cYou would hear it, it was pretty obvious, you would hear her shouting out or she would be chasing them in some way it sounded like that.\n\n\u201cYou could hear her rowing with them and you hear crying or them shouting 'oww' or 'get off\u201d and this kind of thing\n\n\u201cWe never heard Fred's raised voice, sometimes you would look at Fred when you heard Rose's and his eyes would go up into his head and mine would go up into my head and you would just walk away so he was quite aware that she was shouting and moaning, swearing and using obscene language.\u201d\n\nAnne Marie West eventually escaped after marrying boyfriend Chris Davis in 1985 but he also revealed how he witnessed the twisted goings on in the house first hand.\n\nHe described a house gripped by fear which was also used as a brothel with paying punters turning up night and day to have sex with Rose.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nHe described how the upstairs rooms in the house were for Fred and Rose and the children but that there was also Rose's 'special bedroom' where she took her punters.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt had a four poster bed with netting, bloody spotlights in the corner of each post.\n\n\u201cThe doorbell would go, she would answer, disappear for god knows how long, and then come back out.\u201d\n\nChris also revealed how he was desperate to tell the police about the sordid events at the house but Anne Marie would never let him.\n\nHe said: \u201cShe told me in confidence but she asked me not tell anyone about what was going on, she said this is between me and you and that's it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe went through this conversation God knows how many bloody times.\n\n\u201cIf I has persuaded Anne and if she had decided to do something about it maybe there would be a few more people alive but if you had would they have had enough evidence? But it did go through her mind.\n\n\u201cI do remember we did have an argument concerning her parents and one day I said I had had enough I am going to f***ing do something and she said 'for Christ's sake don't Chris because they will kill you and they will kill me'.\u201d\n\nAnother man with knowledge of the terrible home life endured by the West children was John Fitzgerald, who led Gloucestershire County Council's inquiry into the West's dealings with social services.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nThe report he produced revealed the West's came into contact with the authorities many times over the years but they always managed to pull the wool over their eyes.\n\nHis report found 31 occasions when the West children were either admitted to hospital or taken to other care providers with alarming injuries and illnesses.\n\nOne child was even discovered to have gonorrhoea and another was brought to A&E after being hit by Fred with a sledgehammer.\n\nHe said: \u201cI talked to a lot of people who asked me surely you could tell by looking at them? And I said no.\n\n\u201cPeople who are abusers are like everybody else to look at, they don't walk around in dirty macs.\u201d\n\nHe gave one exampled of how the West's deceived the authorities by getting the children to act when they were visited the authorities.\n\nDuring his investigation John found one example of a paediatrician visiting Cromwell street to check up on the children and leaving think nothing was wrong at all.\n\nHe explained: \u201cWhen she got to the house she found some children were playing games, some were playing musical instruments, some were reading and it all looked very calm and happy and normal and she went away very assured and you can't blame her.\n\n\u201cBut those children had been arranged in that situation and those children knew perfectly well what they had to do and they had to play their part in keeping quiet on what was going on that household and they did it very well.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat happens with people like the West's is they know perfectly well that what they are doing is unacceptable to society as a whole.\n\n\u201cSo what they do is work very very hard at trying to cover up and show the world a different face.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Gill Britt, now 58, was just a teenager when she moved into the West's notorious 25 Cromwell Street home in Gloucester in 1978.", "authors": ["Adam Aspinall", "Image", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Pa Archive Press Association Images", "Swns.Com", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20636931.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_25-Cromwell-Street-the-home-of-Fred-and-Rose-West.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
