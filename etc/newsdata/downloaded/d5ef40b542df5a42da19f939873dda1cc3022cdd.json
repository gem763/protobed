The final version of the rule is set to go into effect on October 15, according to the federal register.", "description": "More than 2.5 million households dropped off food stamps since President Donald Trump's first full month in office, USDA data shows.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/05/food-stamps-store-jg-park-flickr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
