REUTERS/Baz Ratner\n\nPolicymakers have held the benchmark rate for seven straight meetings but they said that stance could change soon.\n\n\u201cThe Committee also noted the prospective tightening of fiscal policy which would provide scope for accommodative monetary policy in the near term,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe finance ministry has started cutting non-essential spending to reduce the fiscal deficit from close to 6% of GDP although analysts have expressed worry over the pace and depth of those cuts.\n\nYear-on-year inflation dropped to 5.0% in August from 6.27% a month earlier, helped by falling food prices, data from the statistics office showed.\n\n\u201cOverall inflation is expected to remain within the target range in the near term mainly due to expectations of lower food prices with the expected favourable weather conditions, and lower electricity prices reflecting the reduced usage of expensive power sources,\u201d the central bank said.\n\nDespite the benign inflation, the economy has been hit by a slowdown in private sector credit growth, mainly due to a cap on commercial interest rates, which has locked out borrowers who are deemed by banks to be too risky.\n\nPrivate sector credit grew by 6.3% in the 12 months to August, compared to 6.1% in July, the central bank said, well below the ideal rate of 12-15%.\n\nLawmakers are expected to block the finance ministry\u2019s request to scrap a cap on commercial lending rates imposed by lawmakers in 2016.\n\nIn its budget proposals to parliament in June, the finance ministry sought to repeal the rate cap, arguing that it has constricted private-sector credit to small and medium-sized businesses.", "description": "Kenya's central bank held its benchmark lending rate at 9.0% on Monday, saying inflation was well anchored within the government's preferred range and that the economy was operating close to its potential.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432980797&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M195-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
