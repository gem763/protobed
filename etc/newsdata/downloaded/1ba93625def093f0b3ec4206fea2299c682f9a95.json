Back then, female office-wear mimicked masculine codes in an effort to level the professional playing field, but today women enjoy more flexibility. And lately, female trailblazers\u2014both real and fictional\u2014have been forgoing suits in favor of form-fitting, no-nonsense dresses. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wears them to Davos; Laura Dern stalks around in them in HBO\u2019s hit \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d as tech exec Renata Klein; and politicians on both sides of the aisle, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, have adopted them as their Capitol Hill uniform.\n\nThe power dress\u2014as seen on this fall\u2019s runways from brands as varied as Acne Studios, Brandon Maxwell and Prada\u2014shares little DNA with the Little House on the Prairie-ish, fanciful frocks you\u2019ve been spotting by the beach all summer. Rather, it\u2019s a streamlined shift that projects self-assuredness. \u201cThe typical power dress is something that has coverage and is relatively fitted\u2026something that is really smart-looking [in which] you come across as professional,\u201d said Elizabeth von der Goltz, the London-based global buying director for e-tailer Net-a-Porter.\n\nFor those in the know, the term immediately conjures Roland Mouret\u2019s Galaxy dress, a prototypical power piece whose popularity has held strong since its fall 2005 debut. With a figure-hugging silhouette and pronounced cap sleeve, the Galaxy is lined with sculpted \u201cpower-mesh\u201d fabric which, Mr. Mouret says, \u201csupports you from the inside and makes you feel really at ease.\u201d The Galaxy is crafted from wool felt\u2014a traditionally masculine material\u2014to add weight to its hourglass shape.\n\n21ST CENTURY WOMEN Power dresses in the wild, clockwise from top left: Julianna Margulies as Alicia Florrick on \u2018The Good Wife\u2019; Oprah Winfrey; Anna Wintour; Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Selina Meyer on \u2018Veep\u2019; Angela Bassett; Laura Dern; Robin Wright as Claire Underwood on \u2018House of Cards\u2019; Gemma Chan; Halle Berry; Nancy Pelosi; Meghan Markle; Katie Couric; Sheryl Sandberg; Victoria Beckham.

It can go from day to night, makes you feel confident, and allows you to take ownership of your femininity,\u201d said Zac Posen. \u201cIt needs to have a fabric that holds your body and makes it feel secure,\u201d continued the New York-based designer, who contends that his boardroom-ready sheaths are \u201cleading the numbers\u201d for both his eponymous line and the Brooks Brothers collection he designs. It\u2019s that buttressing sense of security, perhaps, that makes women feel strong in these garments\u2014there\u2019s something to be said for wearing a dress that envelops you sleekly and completely. Unlike a suit or other multipiece outfit, there\u2019s no pulling or adjusting.\n\nA recent report shows women make up more than 50% of the college-educated labor force. It feels stale and predictable for women, as the educated workplace majority, to conform to a male-crafted image of authority. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a change in what the perception of an executive looks like, what a leader looks like. And these days it can be a woman in a dress,\u201d said New York-based Arielle Patrick, 30, a senior executive in financial public relations. \u201cI think the reason power dresses have come into the fore is because we are moving away from women feeling that they need to behave or look like men, in a traditional sense, to be taken seriously.\u201d She admits the meekly conformist suits her mother bought her when she got her first job have collected dust. \u201cI feel more powerful [in a dress]. In a pantsuit, I\u2019ve always felt that I was mimicking an image of what an executive looks like. Like I was pretending. Whereas when I wear a dress, I feel as if I\u2019m integrating my personal style with who I am as a professional.\u201d\n\nWomen are now more confident in the workplace, and that allows for fearless self-expression, argues real estate mogul and shrewd \u201cShark Tank\u201d investor Barbara Corcoran. \u201cWith confidence comes freedom,\u201d said the 70-year-old businesswoman, who wears dresses \u201cnine times out of 10.\u201d Ms. Corcoran suggests that women in senior positions in particular are apt to \u201clet it rip\u201d in designer dresses \u201cbecause they\u2019ve been liberated.\u201d (Nancy Pelosi exemplifies this fierce forthrightness.) And when Ms. Corcoran faces the cameras, dresses give her that extra boost. \u201cFor the last season of \u2018Shark Tank,\u2019 I had two pantsuits that were fabulous\u2026but I didn\u2019t perform as well. And you know why? Because I didn\u2019t feel as powerful. I was conscious of it, and I didn\u2019t repeat the looks. I went right back to dresses.\u201d\n\nFrom the left: THE RADICAL RED ONE Dress, $2,490, akris.com; THE STRICT, TAILORED ONE... WITH A TWIST Dress, $1,975, Alexander McQueen, 212-645-1797; THE 10 DOWNING STREET-APPROPRIATE ONE Dress, $690, goatfashion.com; THE ONE WITH A PINCH OF PIZZAZZ Narciso Rodriguez Dress, $1,995, Bergdorf Goodman, 212-753-7300\n\n\u201cI feel stronger and less encumbered in a dress,\u201d agreed 50-year-old Juliette Kayemm, the Cambridge, Mass.-based CEO of Grip Mobility, former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and CNN analyst. She made the switch from pantsuits five years ago when she realized dresses folded more easily into suitcases for travel, and because they are just one piece, requiring less outfit planning. \u201cThe truth is I like one-zip-on, one-zip-off\u2014it\u2019s just that easy,\u201d she laughed while flipping through her wardrobe, which currently encompasses about 18 power frocks at varying price points by brands ranging from Zara to Zac Posen. She, too, thinks legitimate female autonomy has played a role in the look\u2019s ascent. \u201cI have a confidence in where I am professionally. If men would take me more seriously in a pantsuit, I don\u2019t give a s\u2014.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018The power dress is gaining ground, although some feel its moniker should be left behind with perms and blue eyeshadow.\u2019 \u201d\n\nZac Posen calls that zealously indifferent attitude \u201cself-ownership\u201d and sees it as key to the professional woman\u2019s romance with the power dress. In the past, his dresses were more evening-oriented. But today, \u201cthey\u2019re about making the deal, passing the bill and becoming president. There\u2019s something incredibly powerful about being able to wear a dress in the first place.\u201d So: no more dark-suited wallflowers slouching around a room\u2019s perimeter, hoping to blend in. Mr. Posen\u2019s clients gravitate toward dresses with considered cuts, strong lines and a bit of stretch.\n\nMs. Von der Goltz noted dresses with sleeves, or sleeveless dresses purchased with tailored jackets, are particularly popular on Net-a-Porter.com\u2014which she attributed to chilly office air conditioning. Ms. Corcoran has another take on why sleeves sell: \u201cSleeveless just doesn\u2019t look dressy enough next to a man in a suit. To me, that looks like a junior executive trying to look sexy\u2026When it comes to business, sexy is absolutely the wrong message no matter what your level. Everybody focuses on \u2018God, she\u2019s hot,\u2019 versus, \u2018God, she\u2019s smart.\u2019\u2026It shows a lack of judgment.\u201d There are limits, apparently, to this move toward self-governing femininity.\n\nFrom left: THE LADYLIKE ONE (SANS THE BROOCH) Dress, $2,145, Dolce & Gabbana, 212-897-9653; THE SOMEWHAT DARING LEATHER ONE Dress, $3,980, Bottega Veneta, 212-371-5511; THE SLEEK REESE WITHERSPOON-ISH ONE Brandon Maxwell Dress, $1,795, nordstrom.com; THE FASHION-FORWARD ONE Dress, $4,180, Prada, 212-334-8888\n\nOn HBO\u2019s sitcom \u201cVeep,\u201d which recently came to a close, Julia Louis-Dreyfus played egomaniacal VP-turned-POTUS Selina Meyer, who favors dresses\u2014often in red or jewel tones, and by designers like Victoria Beckham and Narciso Rodriguez. \u201cI really wanted to move away from that traditional skirt or pantsuit. So Julia and I discussed making the dress her new uniform,\u201d said Kathleen Felix-Hager, the show\u2019s costume designer since season three. \u201cWomen who are in the spotlight don\u2019t have to be men. I like the idea of the dress because it\u2019s feminine, but you can still command authority. Those two things can coexist in the same person\u2026and I do notice that a lot of politicians are now wearing more dresses,\u201d she said. Whether the 2020 female presidential candidates will choose to take cues from a ruthless fictional character remains to be seen: In the debates so far, most have still defaulted to blazers, with the notable exception of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (who dropped out of the race this week).\n\nThe sleek power dress is a blank canvas, lending itself to whatever message its wearer wants to project. Nipping one with a belt, as Ms. Louis-Dreyfus did on \u201cVeep,\u201d defines it primly. Heels, often seen on Ms. Corcoran, add a traditional formality that flats can\u2019t. Mrs. Pelosi often garnishes her dress with statement earrings, conveying originality. And some women favor bare, barre-class-sculpted arms (despite Ms. Corcoran\u2019s admonitions to the contrary). Kathryn Bigelow, director of \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d often wears strong, sleeveless columns for events.\n\nThe power dress is gaining ground, although some feel its moniker should be left behind with perms and blue eye shadow. \u201cI really understand now it\u2019s not power dressing; it\u2019s equal dressing,\u201d said Mr. Mouret. \u201cIt\u2019s women showing that they can be equal to men but they don\u2019t need to wear suits.\u201d The public relations executive Ms. Patrick is particularly averse to the phrase. \u201cI think it\u2019s similar to my least favorite term, which is \u2018girl boss.\u2019 There\u2019s this implication that the dress is lacking power, so you need to add the word \u2018power\u2019 to it. It\u2019s just a dress, right? What\u2019s powerful is the woman in it.\u201d", "description": "Why a growing faction of women prefer strong, tailored \u201cpower dresses\u201d for the office, rather than the expected blazers.", "authors": ["Katharine K.
