The United States entered its longest expansion on record in July, yet the deficit has continued to balloon.\n\nThat could be bad news for Mr. Trump, who is heading into a re-election as economic growth begins to slow both in the United States and abroad.\n\n\u201cAmerica remains on the fast track to trillion-dollar deficits, rising rapidly as far as the eye can see,\u201d Michael A. Peterson, chief executive of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said. \u201cWith all of the important investments we need to make in our future, we find ourselves in a situation where interest costs are the fastest growing program in the federal budget.\u201d\n\nThe deficit is growing in large part because tax receipts are falling, as Mr. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts continue to siphon revenue from the Treasury. The numbers reflect the fact that Mr. Trump\u2019s most significant legislative achievement is not paying for itself, as Republicans have said it would. In fact, tax revenue for the last two years has fallen more than $400 billion short of what the Congressional Budget Office projected in June 2017, six months before the tax law was passed.", "description": "The Treasury Department said the deficit, which came in at $984 billion, will top $1 trillion in 2020.", "authors": ["Alan Rappeport"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/business/25dc-defecit/25dc-defecit-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
