The drop continued a horrid stretch for Overstock shares, which have fallen in seven consecutive trading sessions that add up to a decline of 58.1%, the worst seven-day stretch in Overstock history, according to information from Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nMonday\u2019s decline followed an announcement ahead of trading that Overstock\u2019s chief financial officer had resigned and that the company\u2019s retail business would not live up to financial expectations in the back-to-school quarter. Overstock said CFO Greg Iverson will be replaced on an interim basis by Robert Hughes, who worked in Overstock\u2019s finance department for many years and will also remain president of Medici Land Governance, one of Overstock\u2019s blockchain-based ventures.\n\nIverson resigned as of last Tuesday, Sept. 17, Overstock said Monday; the company did not provide a reason for the departure nor why the company waited nearly a week to announce the change. The date provides some clues, however: Overstock announced the next morning that a \u201cdigital dividend\u201d that was expected to be dispersed this week had instead been changed and delayed after \u201cfeedback ... from industry participants, investors and regulators.\u201d\n\nThe dividend was designed by Chief Executive Patrick Byrne before he dramatically resigned from the company last month amid claims of deep involvement in international political conspiracies. Byrne sold all his stock \u2014 more than 13% of the company \u2014 in a three-day sales binge at the beginning of last week, as the record seven-day decline was early in the making.\n\nByrne originally said in a blog post that he and an adviser decided to sell his shares after hearing \u201cleaks\u201d from the Securities and Exchange Commission to bankers on Friday, Sept. 13, concerning the SEC\u2019s plans to combat the digital dividend. As trading began on that Friday, Overstock\u2019s shares had gained 74% in the previous seven sessions as investors awaited the dividend, which was widely expected to squeeze short sellers as investors attempted to reclaim borrowed shares to secure the dividend.\n\nOpinion: Overstock founder tried to squeeze short sellers, then sold out when the SEC cracked down\n\nByrne changed that timeline after being asked if he had sold the shares while in possession of material nonpublic trading information from his time at Overstock. He then said on Twitter, and updated his blog post to reflect, that he had actually decided to sell the shares on Aug. 19, though he interchangeably used the date Aug. 22 \u2014 his departure date from Overstock \u2014 at times in various statements.\n\n\u201cCan the SEC come after me for trading on THEIR leaks? lol,\u201d Byrne tweeted at a MarketWatch reporter on Saturday, while reportedly in Asia.\n\n\u201cByrne continues to be a public figure, and the views he expresses and actions he takes are his own,\u201d Overstock stated in its news release Monday morning, in a brief mention of Byrne\u2019s stock sale.\n\nOverstock also announced that Jonathan Johnson, who replaced Byrne on an interim basis, has been elected permanent CEO of the company by the board. The company said that it expects adjusted Ebitda to be break-even for the fiscal third quarter, after previously guiding for a profitable quarter by that measure. Overstock still expects to achieve positive adjusted Ebitda in the fourth quarter, and will provide a more detailed forecast update when it announces full third-quarter results.", "description": "Overstock.com Inc. shares lost more than a quarter of their value Monday, the worst single-day performance for the stock in more than a decade.", "authors": ["Jeremy C.
