I couldn't tell you what kind of Ferrari or what kind of Porsche I was looking at.\" 2:02\n\nIt's no question that automobile fanatics are going to scrutinize the fine details of James Mangold's 60s-set Ford v Ferrari, an inevitability which made accepting the job \"terrifying\" for production designer Fran\u00e7ois Audouy.\n\nHe assures, however, that he is very rarely an expert of the subject matter when he starts on a new project and both he and Mangold had to do their homework by conducting extensive research about race cars of that era.\n\nAt the end of the day, Audouy explains, Ford v Ferrari is as much about high-speed vehicles as serving as a vehicle for the stories of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles, portrayed by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, respectively.\n\nThe production design team behind The Lighthouse lost a gigantic rock overseas\n\nThe Lighthouse's Craig Lathrop tells the strange story of how it being illegal to train seagulls started a strange series of events. 2:03\n\nDirector Robert Eggers is known for the obsessive detail he brings to assembling the worlds of period horror flicks and you can expect nothing less from his latest film, The Lighthouse \u2014 which called for trained seagulls and one massive boulder.\n\nThe production design team, led by Craig Lathrop, found themselves in a scramble when they discovered that, although training the birds had been deemed illegal, there were a colony of seagulls in London that they would be able to hire.\n\nHowever, challenges continued to present themselves. Like when the team tried chopping up an oversized set piece and shipping it across the Atlantic Ocean. Lathrop recounts how one overnight flight and several hockey bags were used to save the day in the nick of time.\n\nWatch the entire panel here:\n\nMore highlights from our TIFF panel discussions are coming later this week.", "description": "From finding vintage cars to hiring live seagulls, no detail is overlooked.", "authors": ["Cbc Arts"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287449.1568754623!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tiff-production-designers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
