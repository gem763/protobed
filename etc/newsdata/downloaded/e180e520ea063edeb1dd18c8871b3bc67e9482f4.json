Syracuse notched a fourth-quarter safety to win it, breaking a tie when Holy Cross punter Tom Rock was tackled in the end zone after the snap sailed over his head.\n\nWith plenty of reminders all around - The Citadel upset Georgia Tech 27-24 in overtime two weeks ago - Syracuse isn\u2019t about to take any foe lightly. Even one whose only victory - 13-10 over New Hampshire - was secured with a fumble recovery in the end zone with under 2 minutes to play in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve got to be ready to go at all times,\u201d said Robinson, who had six tackles, including 3.5 for a loss, two sacks and five quarterback hurries in the 52-33 win over WMU . \u201cThey do a couple of different things offensively that we haven\u2019t seen in a while.\u201d\n\nOrange coach Dino Babers remains wary, the memory of lopsided losses to Maryland and No. 1 Clemson a reminder of what can go wrong.\n\n\u201cI would hope that we didn\u2019t get too down because we had two losses, and I would hope that we\u2019re not too up because we had a win over Western Michigan,\u201d Babers said. \u201cThere\u2019s a process going on here. We\u2019ve talked about it from day one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really had a more difficult road to hoe than what people are giving us credit for,\u201d Babers added, noting that Syracuse began the season with road games against Liberty and the Terps. \u201cI just think we need to let it happen, be patient, let it come to us, and as these guys grow up we\u2019re going to get better and better. I think they got better, but they\u2019re not exactly where I want them right now.\u201d\n\nOther things to know when Holy Cross visits Syracuse on Saturday:\n\nTRICKERY COMING?\n\nMaine put a brief early scare into the Orange in Doug Marrone\u2019s second year as Syracuse head coach nine years ago, using gimmicks and trick plays before falling 38-14.\n\nMore of that coming?\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Holy Cross tailback Domenic Cozier said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to try to let her rip. We know we\u2019ve really got nothing to lose. We\u2019ve been working on looks they\u2019ve never seen before. We\u2019ve been practicing them all week, so it\u2019ll be interesting.\u201d\n\nTHE STREAK\n\nSyracuse recovered three fumbles and intercepted a pass against Western Michigan to extend its streak of consecutive games with a takeaway to 18, the third-longest active streak in FBS behind Houston (21) and Mississippi State (19). The Orange also have intercepted at least one pass in 17 straight games, the longest active streak nationally. Holy Cross QB Connor Degenhardt has not thrown an interception. Babers was hopeful secondary standouts Andre Cisco and Ifeatu Melifonwu would return from injuries.\n\nDISCIPLINE, NO DISCIPLINE\n\nHoly Cross ranks third in the nation in fewest penalty yards (26.7 per game) while Syracuse is 126th with 36 penalties in four games, and only three other teams have more penalty yards than the Orange\u2019s 311.\n\nMOE\u2019S MOMENT\n\nSyracuse RB Moe Neal needs five yards to become the 23rd player in program history to reach 2,000 career rushing yards. The Holy Cross defense is allowing nearly 300 yards rushing per game, though that total includes a 45-7 loss at Navy to open the season. The Midshipmen\u2019s option attack accounted for 428 rushing yards.\n\nORANGE RULE\n\nSince Division I was split into two tiers in 1978, Syracuse is 17-0 against teams from the Championship Subdivision, all but one of the wins coming inside the Carrier Dome. The Crusaders, who joined the FCS in 1982, have three wins in 17 games against Bowl Subdivision opposition, all against Army (1986, 1987, and 2002). Before the NCAA split the divisions, Holy Cross defeated Syracuse 14-13 at Worcester, Massachusetts in 1958, a year before the Orange won their lone national championship, making the Crusaders the last current FCS team to beat Syracuse.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Syracuse isn't where it hoped to be when the season started, but there's nothing like a win to alter the mindset.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Kekis"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/clemson_syracuse_football_22489_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
