Thus, the case was declined.\u2019\n\nSpacey has been accused of misconduct by several men including actor Anthony Rapp who alleged he was 14 when Spacey, then 26, made a sexual advance to him in 1986.\n\nSpacey said he did not remember such an encounter with Rapp but apologised if the allegations were true.\n\nThe actor has, in turn, denied them all; he was fired from Netflix drama House Of Cards following the allegations.\n\nSpacey also faces six allegations of sexual assault in the UK between 1996 and 2013; the inquiries are ongoing.\n\nHe was voluntarily interviewed under caution in May 2019. In July, prosecutors in the US dropped a case accusing the actor of groping a teenager at a bar in 2016, which he denied.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
