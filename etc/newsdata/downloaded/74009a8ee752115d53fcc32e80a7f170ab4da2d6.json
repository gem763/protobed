Her evidence: the gross homophobic comments that disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein allegedly made to her, long before he tried to make her kiss another actress in front of him.\n\nIt\u2019s one of a few vulnerable subjects Delevingne touches on in an interview with Net-a-Porter, in which she opens up about everything from feeling voiceless as a supermodel to defining her sexuality. \u201cI fucking hate it,\u201d she says of the latter topic, before speaking more broadly to her experience as a queer woman in the industry and recounting the anecdote about Weinstein, which she says was one of her first interactions with him.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things Harvey Weinstein ever said to me was, \u2018You will never make it in this industry as a gay woman \u2014 get a beard,\u2019\u201d she says. She also claims that he when she was starting to audition for screen roles, Weinstein would name famous women and ask her if she had ever slept with them. \u201cI just thought: this is insane,\u201d Delevingne says.\n\nClearly, Weinstein\u2019s prediction didn\u2019t hold up. While it is inarguable that queer female celebrities still face homophobia \u2014 just last week, Kristen Stewart opened up about an unnamed Hollywood figure who warned her against holding hands with her girlfriend in public \u2014 Delevingne has objectively seen great success in her career. She\u2019s currently promoting Carnival Row, the new Amazon Prime show in which she appears alongside Orlando Bloom. Meanwhile, she\u2019s also become a vocal advocate for LGBTQ youth and is in a happy, committed relationship with Ashley Benson. Though the couple has kept many of details about their relationship under wraps, Delevingne isn\u2019t apprehensive to talk about how much she loves her girlfriend.\n\n\u201cI never really trusted people, or felt worthy of it, and I always pushed them away,\u201d she tells Net-a-Porter. \u201c[Benson is] the first person that has said: \u2018You can\u2019t push me away. I\u2019m going to be nice to you, I love you.\u2019 I\u2019m just like, wait, so all I have to do is just let you be nice to me? Why have I never done that before?\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
