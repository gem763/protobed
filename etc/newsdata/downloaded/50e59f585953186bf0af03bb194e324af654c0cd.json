Following the results of these tests it has been confirmed that the man arrested is not the man suspected of crimes in France,\u201d the police,\u201d said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe man has since been released. The man and his family have no wish to speak to the media at this time and ask that their privacy be respected on this matter.\u201d\n\nSources close to the probe said the conclusion was reached after DNA tests.\n\nThe detained man was stopped in Glasgow after arriving on a flight from Paris following an anonymous tip-off, according to French sources close to the investigation.\n\nSources had said earlier that a fingerprint match had been made.\n\n\u2013 Looks nothing like suspect \u2013\n\nA police search was carried out on Friday at the arrested man\u2019s house in Limay in the western suburbs of Paris.\n\nNeighbours told AFP the house belonged to Guy Joao, a man of Portuguese origin with French and British nationality and who is married to a Scottish woman.\n\nIt remained unclear what caused the confusion. One neighbour said Guy Joao does not \u201clook anything like\u201d Dupont de Ligonnes.\n\nDupont de Ligonnes, 58, is suspected of shooting his family dead and burying them under the terrace of their townhouse in Nantes, western France.\n\nTheir bodies were found three weeks after the killings during which time Dupont de Ligonnes reportedly told his teenage children\u2019s school he had been transferred to a job in Australia.\n\nHe is said to have told friends he was a US secret agent who was being taken into a witness protection programme.\n\nFrench prosecutors have said he killed all five of his victims in a \u201cmethodical execution\u201d, shooting them each twice in the head at close range with a weapon fitted with a silencer.\n\nHe is believed to have covered them in quicklime and wrapped them in sheets before burying them under concrete.\n\nFor years France has been gripped by the question of how Dupont de Ligonnes disappeared without trace, with some suggesting he may have killed himself. Hundreds of reported sightings only added to the mystery.\n\nIn 2015, a letter and photo of two of his sons, signed with his name and the message \u201cI am still alive\u201d, was delivered to an AFP journalist but experts could not verify its authenticity.\n\nIn January last year, police moved in on a monastery in the Var region of southern France after witnesses reported seeing a man resembling him but the suspect was not caught.\n\nLe Parisien newspaper which on Friday reported Dupont de Ligonnes\u2019 arrest in Glasgow on Saturday apologised to the family of the victims and the wrongly arrested man.\n\nThe paper said in a statement it wanted to express its \u201csincere regret for having made public information which turned out to be wrong\u201d.", "description": "Glasgow (AFP) \u2013 Scotland\u2019s police on Saturday released a man after he was mistaken for a French fugitive wanted for killing his wife and four", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/517977_xavier-dupont-de-ligonnes-is-subject-an-international-arrest-warrant-killing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
