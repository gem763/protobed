The city, along with Democratic lawmakers, has petitioned the court to refuse to hear the case, arguing the change in law has made the conflict moot.\n\n\u201cThe respondents\u2019 suggestion of mootness is denied. The question of mootness will be subject to further consideration at oral argument, and the parties should be prepared to discuss it,\u201d the court noted in its orders.\n\nDemocrats fear a 5-4 ruling would expand on the last 12 years of pro-gun rulings.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse argued in a brief, joined by other Senate Democrats, that a series of similar rulings with \u201cbare partisan majorities\u201d has damaged the public trust in the federal judiciary.\n\nThe Rhode Island Democrat said in his filing that the GOP-majority on the court is too tainted to deliver a valid ruling, reminding the court it could be restructured in the future.\n\nHe pointed to a Quinnipiac poll from May, which found 55% of Americans said the court was \u201cmainly motivated by politics.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehouse did not elaborate on what the public pressure for a \u201crestructured\u201d court might look like.\n\nBut several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have suggested they would propose expanding the high court to as many as 15 justices if they win the White House, then fill those seats with liberal members to counter the GOP\u2019s current 5-4 majority in appointments.\n\nThe idea of packing the court was rejected by its most senior Democratic appointee, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, last month.\n\n\u201cNine seems to be a good number, and it\u2019s been that way for a long time,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said in an interview with NPR.\n\nMr. Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that vets federal judges, pointed out in his brief that Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, confirmed to the court last year, was backed by the National Rifle Association during his confirmation process.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, rejected Mr. Whitehouse\u2019s arguments on Twitter, saying the high court is just fine.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is well. The American political system is the sick patient (Kavanaugh hearings). The Court is moving center-right and getting out of the left ditch. That\u2019s exactly where the country is headed!\u201d Mr. Graham posted on Twitter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
