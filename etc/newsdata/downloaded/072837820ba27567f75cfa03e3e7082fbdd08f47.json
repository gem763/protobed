Highs: Mid-90s.\n\nTonight: Warm and muggy. Lows: Upper 60s to mid-70s.\n\nTomorrow: Partly to mostly cloudy, cooler.

With moderate humidity (dew points in the mid- to upper 60s), the afternoon heat index should reach near 100. A warm breeze blows from the west around 10 mph, with just a slight chance of a late-afternoon or early-evening shower or thundershower.\n\nWe\u2019re likely to break the record highs for the date \u2014 89 degrees at Reagan National in 1986, 89 at Dulles in 1986, and 89 at BWI in 1986 \u2014 and could challenge Washington\u2019s highest October temperature on record (96 in 1941). Confidence: High\n\nTonight: Still that slight chance of an early-evening shower or thundershower. Otherwise we\u2019re uncomfortably warm and humid as evening temperatures drop back into the 80s. With partly cloudy skies, overnight lows only dip to the midsummer-like upper 60s to mid-70s. Confidence: High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates.

Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend...\n\nTomorrow (Thursday): A cold front pushing in from the northeast should push the high heat to our southwest. We\u2019re still fairly warm though, with partly to mostly cloudy skies as highs range anywhere from the mid-70s to mid-80s (coolest north and east, warmest south and west) depending on the exact location of the front. The air remains rather humid (dew points in the mid- to upper 60s) with a light wind from the east-northeast. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Can\u2019t rule out an isolated evening shower. But then less humid air finally starts to filter in as winds pick up from the northwest. Lows fall back to the 60s with partly cloudy skies. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nRefreshingly cooler high pressure settles in for a partly to mostly sunny Friday and Saturday. Friday winds are rather breezy from the north-northwest with highs in the 70s. Saturday trends even cooler, with lighter winds and highs in the mid-60s to near 70. Friday night lows bottom in the 40s, with Saturday night lows in the 50s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nSunday warms up ahead of the next cold front, with partly sunny skies and pleasant highs in the 70s to near 80. Could see a chance of showers by Sunday evening.
