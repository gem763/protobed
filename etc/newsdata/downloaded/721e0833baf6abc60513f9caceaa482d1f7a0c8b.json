(AP) - Roman Josi extended San Jose\u2019s early-season woes.\n\nJosi scored two early goals, and the Nashville Predators beat the Sharks 5-2 on Tuesday night, dropping San Jose to 0-4.\n\nKyle Turris, Filip Forsberg and Dante Fabbro also scored for the Predators, who have won two of three to start the season.\n\nBrent Burns had a goal and an assist and Evander Kane also scored for the struggling Sharks.\n\n\u201cThis is a league where you have to combine work ethic with a smart game,\u201d Sharks coach Peter DeBoer said. \u201cWe made a few glaring mistakes, and the ones we made they stuck in the back of the net. That\u2019s what a good team will do to you.\u201d\n\nJosi opened the scoring early in the first period.\n\nColton Sissons carried the puck into the San Jose zone. From the right faceoff dot, he found Josi skating through the slot with a pass. Josi beat Sharks goaltender Martin Jones with a wrist shot high to the stick side.\n\n\u201c(Sissons) got it and made a nice move around a defenseman,\u201d Josi said. \u201cI had a lot of space there in the middle because of his moves, so he made a good play to me.\u201d\n\nJosi scored again at 10:25 of the second.\n\nWith the Predators on a power play, Forsberg\u2019s attempt from the left faceoff dot hit the shaft of Jones\u2019 stick and then deflected off the post. Josi stepped in front of the Sharks\u2019 Marc-Edouard Vlasic\u2019s clearing attempt and then fired the puck into the vacated net on Jones\u2019 far side.\n\nKane halved the Predators lead at 15:12 of the second on the power play, deflecting Logan Couture\u2019s shot from above the left faceoff circle past Nashville goaltender Pekka Rinne for his first of the season.\n\n\u201cWhen things are not really going your way, you try sometimes to do a little bit too much,\u201d Sharks defenseman Erik Karlsson said. \u201cI think that today we had longer periods of time when we were controlling play and we were playing the way that we want. But again, I don\u2019t think that we started the way that we wanted.\u201d\n\nRinne made 33 saves, while Jones finished with 20.\n\nKane returned to the lineup after serving a three-game suspension for physical abuse of an official during the team\u2019s final preseason game.\n\nTurris gave Nashville another two-goal advantage early in the third with a wrist shot over Jones\u2019 glove off a bank pass from Rocco Grimaldi.\n\nThe goal was Turris\u2019 first of the season. He scored seven last season, during which he played in 55 games with two stints on injured reserve.\n\n\u201cIt was a big goal at the time,\u201d Nashville coach Peter Laviolette said. \u201cI think that offensive players do feed off of that with confidence. I hope that line continues to produce because I liked them a lot last game and they scored a big goal for us tonight.\u201d\n\nForsberg found the net at 7:24 of the third, set up by Matt Duchene, who has six assists in three games with Nashville.\n\n\u201c(The Sharks) were playing better, especially in the second part of the second period,\u201d Forsberg said. \u201cI thought we came out OK in the third, but they still had a couple of chances.\u201d\n\nBurns made it 4-2 at 15:37 of the third, and Fabbro added a late empty-netter.\n\nNOTES: Forsberg has points in each of Nashville\u2019s games this season. \u2026 Josi has scored twice 10 times but has never posted a hat trick. \u2026 Before the game, San Jose announced it had signed former captain C Patrick Marleau to a 1-year contract. He\u2019s expected to meet the Sharks in Chicago before Thursday\u2019s game against the Blackhawks. \u2026 Kane\u2019s power-play goal was the Sharks\u2019 first man-advantage goal of the season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSharks: Visit the Chicago Blackhawks on Thursday.\n\nPredators: Host the Washington Capitals on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Roman Josi extended San Jose's early-season woes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Diamond"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/sharks_predators_hockey_50412_c0-153-3671-2293_s1770x1032.jpg?b7c8baf437d4c12da43084fb8c699ad658e2f8ef", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
