CNN capitalized on the spectacle by hosting an \u201cLGBTQ Town Hall\u201d Thursday evening, giving nine candidates about 30 minutes each to answer questions. Chris Cuomo hosted the segment featuring Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nSoon after taking the stage, a woke Harris told Cuomo that her \u201cpronouns are she, her, and hers.\u201d Cuomo joked back, \u201cMine too.\u201d For some reason, the joke fell flat on the audience of LGBTQ members and transgender activists, who frequently erupted in protest throughout the evening.\n\nAfter Cuomo\u2019s joke bombed, CNN quickly switched to another camera, but an apparently stunned Harris can be heard saying, \u201calright.\u201d\n\nBy the time the segment ended, angry tweets were awaiting Cuomo in his Twitter feed.\n\nKamala Harris declared her pronouns on such a major stage and she should be applauded but instead it was so disappointing for Chris Cuomo to mock it in that moment. #EqualityTownHall #PowerOfOurPride \u2014 GLAAD (@glaad) October 11, 2019\n\nAnd GLAAD wasn't the only one not laughing.\n\nChris Cuomo just mocked Sen. Kamala Harris saying her pronouns by responding \"mine too\" and the gasp I let out.\n\n\n\nNot. Okay. \u2014 Zach Stafford (@ZachStafford) October 11, 2019\n\nAs soon as she is introduced, @KamalaHarris immediately shares her pronouns. Then @ChrisCuomo promptly ruins the important moment. #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/GqjVXBwmfx \u2014 Zack Ford (@ZackFord) October 11, 2019\n\nShortly after his segment with Harris ended, Cuomo apologized on Twitter.", "description": "The Democrat nominees for president are all fighting over the LGBTQ vote..10/11/2019 15:36:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/262/bdaa8456-af33-4e43-8b48-f3ee4ff78ad7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
