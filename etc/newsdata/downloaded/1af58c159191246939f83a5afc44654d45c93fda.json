Anderson then jumped to his feet to \u201csearch\u201d for a new host, running backstage to steal some Emmys with his mother and talk to a producer about who should fill Simpson\u2019s shoes.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is an Emmy winner who can talk about the power of television,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nBryan Cranston was then pushed on stage, where he launched into an impassioned speech about the power of television.\n\nCranston talked about watching Neil Armstrong walking on the moon on television fifty years ago when he was 13 years old, and how it inspired him to \u201cbe anyone\u201d and \u201cgo anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven Albuquerque,\u201d he quipped in a reference to his iconic show, \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d\n\nThe actor went on to deliver a strong (albeit brief) speech about what modern television can accomplish.\n\n\u201cFifty years later, television still transports us to faraway places like Winterfell, the Upside Down, even paradise,\u201d said Cranston. \u201cAnd it welcomes us into a family home where we laugh with the Dunphys and we cry with the Pearsons. And it\u2019s multiple times every single week. Please stop making us cry.\u201d\n\nThe opening went on to have Cranston say that \u201ctelevision has never been this damn good\u201d and lead into a montage of selected scenes from shows over the last year.\n\nResponses to the whole thing were varied:\n\nI love this opening. #Emmys\n\n\n\nSay what you will but television, when done right, is an incredible achievement of ingenuity. \u2014 Rev. Rob Lee (@roblee4) September 23, 2019\n\nThis loooong opening kinda defeats the purpose of not having a host #Emmys \u2014 Erik Anderson (@awards_watch) September 23, 2019\n\nLove Anthony Anderson, but I kinda wish they had written a few more actual jokes for him in this #emmys opening... \u2014 Eric Deggans at NPR (@Deggans) September 23, 2019\n\nThis Emmy opener is painful. #Emmys \u2014 Molly Cotner (@MollyCotner) September 23, 2019\n\nJust cried at the opener for the Emmy\u2019s....I am...weak \u2014 madi the baddie (@madi_yepthatsme) September 23, 2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear what the opening number was going to look like this year, as the Emmys are host-free for the first time in 16 years. In 2018, hosts Michael Che and Colin Jost rang in the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards by joking with celebrities like Kate McKinnon, Kenan Thompson, Kristen Bell and John Legend about the unprecedented diversity at the show.", "description": "Amid a host-free awards ceremony, the show featured some screwball comedy and the \"Breaking Bad\" actor giving a speech about the power of TV.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d880f432100000a06e9df85.png?cache=4kif6lbslb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
