I take full responsibility for not thoroughly vetting all the details of the performance and offer my personal apology to those who were offended. We strive to create a family atmosphere at Kansas and fell short of that this evening.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg met with players from both teams before taking the court for the show, during which he sprayed both benches with fake money bearing his face.\n\nCoach Bill Self said the show was not what he expected.\n\n\"That's not the direction that anybody at our school would want that to go at all,\" he said, per ESPN. \"Regardless of the entertainment that it provided many, it was still not the right way to provide the entertainment.\"\n\nScrutiny over the event comes on the heels of Kansas receiving a notice of allegations from the NCAA last month that cited major violations in the men's basketball program and lesser violations regarding the football program.\n\nSelf was charged with head coach responsibility violations.
