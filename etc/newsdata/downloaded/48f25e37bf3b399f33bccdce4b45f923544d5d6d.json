But it wasn\u2019t. This latest case, which is still making its way through the courts, and a series of others illustrate how Spain\u2019s far right is harnessing and fomenting misinformation during a genuine moment of attempted reform to further its agenda. But while far-right parties across Europe\u2014from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) to Italy\u2019s League and France\u2019s National Rally\u2014all tout anti-immigration platforms and have justified them as necessary to protect local women, such rhetoric is new in Spain. Anti-immigration sentiment here was, until recently, comparatively low for western Europe, but that is at risk of changing.\n\nThough Vox has a marginal presence in Catalonia, where it has just one elected representative, and nationally (it has less than 4 percent of seats in Parliament), it\u2019s whipping up anti-immigration sentiment across social media, criminalizing migrants\u2014especially youth migrants\u2014by co-opting progressives\u2019 zero-tolerance rhetoric for sexual assault.\n\n\u201cUltraconservative sectors, groups with a certain affinity for Vox, and the far right are weaponizing the arguments being made by social movements, whether feminism or LGBT or human rights, to delegitimize them,\u201d Violeta Assiego, a human-rights lawyer, told me.\n\nRead: Betting on anti-feminism as a winning political strategy\n\nAfter reports emerged that the public prosecution in the Manresa case was charging the accused with \u201csexual abuse\u201d and not rape, Vox took it upon itself to champion the victim\u2019s rights. Ignacio Garriga, Vox\u2019s lone lawmaker in Catalonia, tweeted a video of a man standing alone before the Barcelona courthouse where the trial was unfolding, holding up a sign that read IT\u2019S NOT ABUSE, IT\u2019S RAPE\u2014the same slogan women had rallied behind during the Pamplona Wolf Pack protests. (This month, the public prosecution elevated the charges to rape.) Garriga denounced what he said was the \u201chypocrisy of the so-called feminist movement\u201d for not voicing greater outrage, saying he was against \u201call those who fall silent when a rape is perpetrated by illegal immigrants, in this case, MENA\u2019s,\u201d the Spanish acronym by which migrant children are known, which rights groups avoid using because they believe it dehumanizes them.\n\nMost youth immigrants are boys from Morocco ages 14 to 17 who\u2019ve come to Spain to finish school and find work. Once they reach Spanish soil, they\u2019re automatically considered wards of the state, since child services here extend to both citizens and migrants. But that\u2019s contingent on proving their age\u2014that they\u2019re younger than 18\u2014which can be difficult for older teens. Once that\u2019s done, they\u2019re registered with the police, fingerprinted, and ID\u2019d, then transferred to residential centers (though this can take weeks or months). There are approximately 2,500 youth migrants in these shelters in Catalonia, though some evade local authorities and strike out on their own.\n\nOn a hot July morning, I visited a group of eight teenagers living in such a center, a nondescript apartment building in a suburb of Barcelona.", "description": "Spain was gripped by news of a gang rape carried out by North African migrants.
