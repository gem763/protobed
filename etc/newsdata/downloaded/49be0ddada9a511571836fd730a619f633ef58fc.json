After a global outrage, including a sternly-worded tweet from Rubio, Blizzard lowered the suspension for six months.\n\nThe punishment would have been the same no matter what blitzchung said, claimed Blizzard Entertainment President J. Allen Brack, and insisted the company\u2019s many business ties with China had no influence on the decision.\n\nAmerican collegiate esports players made a similar protest on U.S. soil, daring Blizzard to ban them too. The three American University students were eventually suspended for six months earlier this week.\n\nAD\n\nThe Hong Kong protests have been a common rallying point for social activists in recent months. A proposal by Hong Kong to allow extraditions to China sparked the movement, as it was seen by some as an attempt by Beijing to pick apart the autonomy and liberties promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.\n\nAD\n\nBlizzard has invested in China\u2019s esports scene through its Overwatch League, placing franchises in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Chengdu. Tencent, a Chinese entertainment giant, owns a five-percent stake in Blizzard\u2019s parent company, Activision Blizzard.\n\nAn official letter from Congress may only throw more wood into the fire surrounding Blizzard at a particularly poor time for the company. BlizzCon, the company\u2019s annual gathering of tens of thousands of fans, begins Nov. 1.\n\nAD\n\nSeveral protests are being planned, including a few Facebook event pages for \u201cRaid BlizzCon 2019 dressed as Winnie the Pooh,\" the beloved children\u2019s character that eventually was banned in China because of Internet memes mocking China President Xi Jinping.\n\nFight For The Future, an online freedom activist group, has called for an umbrella protest of companies appearing to bend a knee to the Chinese government.\n\nAD\n\nEvan Greer, the group\u2019s deputy director, said moderation on social networks are among \u201cthe most important decisions that humans are making right now.\"\n\n\u201cCompanies should make content moderation decisions based on the needs of their community and humanity as a whole, not based on pressure from governments, whether it\u2019s the U.S., China or the U.K.,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nGreer added that this feels different from the multitudes of other Internet outrage explosions, and that she\u2019s seeing people consider political action.\n\n\u201cBlizzard is trying to hide the fact that they\u2019re blatantly acting as censors on behalf of a government by claiming they just have a blanket ban on all \u2018political\u2019 speech,\u201d she said. \u201cHow you define what speech is \u2018political\u2019 and what speech is okay is a highly political decision in and of itself.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The letter escalates the storm Blizzard faces ahead of its annual BlizzCon event the first weekend of November.", "authors": ["Gene Park"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gTzWO33-3pl2JzJ3pM1OB8D7oAI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PQAOUJHRZEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
