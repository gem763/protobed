REUTERS/Yuya Shino\n\nInvestors' renewed appetite for riskier assets weighed on the safe-haven yen JPY= and U.S. Treasury prices, while oil stayed firm on comments about possible supply cuts from the head of OPEC.\n\nIn early Asian trade, MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.5%, following on from gains on Wall Street. S&P e-mini futures ESc1 added 0.2%.\n\nAustralian shares climbed 0.8%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index .N225 gained 0.9%.\n\nThe more bullish market mood came after a first day of trade talks between top U.S. and Chinese negotiators that Trump characterised as \u201cvery, very good.\u201d\n\nA White House official said the talks had gone \u201cprobably better than expected\u201d and a U.S. Chamber of Commerce official briefed by both sides raised the possibility of a currency agreement this week.\n\n\u201cFreezing tariffs at current levels are unlikely to reverse the current trade driven slowdown in economic growth, and the uncertainty around unresolved structural issues such as IP theft and subsidies to state own enterprises are likely to remain deterrents for a pick-up in much needed capital expenditure,\u201d analysts at National Australia Bank said in a morning note.\n\n\u201cOn this score details on a potential currency pact will be important,\u201d they said.\n\nThe dollar rose 0.1% against the yen to 108.07 JPY=, while the euro was flat at $1.1004 and the pound was slightly lower, fetching $1.2432.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down at 98.663 after posting its biggest daily drop in five weeks on waning safe-haven demand for the currency.\n\nThe British pound jumped nearly 2% on Thursday, its biggest daily gain since March, after Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a Brexit deal could be clinched by the end of October after what he called a very positive meeting with his British counterpart, Boris Johnson.\n\nThe move away from safe havens also lifted the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR to 1.6716% compared with a U.S. close of 1.656% on Thursday. Yields rose across the curve, with two-year notes US2YT=RR yielding 1.5464% compared with a U.S. close of 1.53%.\n\nIn commodity markets, oil prices remained higher after the head of OPEC said the organisation could take action to balance oil markets, including a deeper cut in oil supplies.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 was up 0.43% to $53.78 a barrel and global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 was up 0.46% at $59.37 per barrel.\n\nRising risk appetite tarnished gold\u2019s appeal, pushing spot gold XAU= down 0.16% to $1,491.65 per ounce.", "description": "Asian shares and U.S. stock futures rose on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet with China's top trade negotiator, while sterling retreated after rallying on revived hopes of a possible Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Andrew Galbraith", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439494969&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A01X", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
