They consider them friends and even, in some cases, brothers in arms. While the Kurds may not have been with the Americans in Normandy, as Trump curiously noted on Wednesday, neither were the US service members who are now in Iraq and Syria. What those service members know, military officials say, is that the Kurds have been with them in Manbij and Raqqa and the Middle Euphrates River Valley.\n\n\"What happens if we leave?\" the normally reticent General Joseph Votel, who until March was the commander of US Central Command overseeing the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, wrote in an article in The Atlantic on Tuesday, two days after the White House announced it was leaving the Kurds. In the piece, Votel speaks fondly of the top Kurdish general, Mazloum Abdi, whom he describes as \"impressive and thoughtful\".\n\nVotel, now retired, writes that Turkish attacks on the Kurdish fighters, \"coupled with a hasty US departure, now threaten to rapidly destabilise an already fragile security situation in Syria's north-east, where [Islamic State's] physical caliphate was only recently defeated\".\n\nPeople at the border watch smoke billowing from targets inside Syria, during bombardment by Turkish forces. AP\n\nPaul Eaton, a retired major general and veteran of the Iraq War, is more blunt. \"It takes time to build trust,\" he says. \"And any time you erode trust, like this, it's that much harder to bring it back.\"\n\nPentagon officials fear that Turkey's incursion could lead to the release of tens of thousands of Islamic State fighters and their families who are being held in detention facilities under Kurdish control, and a rapid return of the self-proclaimed caliphate that the US and its partners have spent the last five years destroying.\n\nBut even more, they fear that the next time the US is looking for help from fighters on the ground in the region, the Americans will not be able to find it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has happened before. In February 1991, as the Desert Storm campaign was unfolding in Iraq, president George H.W. Bush, during a rally in Andover, Massachusetts, suggested that the Iraqi people \"take matters into their own hands and force Saddam Hussein, the dictator, to step aside\".\n\nTwo weeks later, Bush made another call to arms, saying that putting Saddam \"aside\" would \"facilitate the resolution of all these problems that exist and certainly would facilitate the acceptance of Iraq back into the family of peace-loving nations\".\n\nIraq's feared Republican Guard did not heed Bush. But the Shiites and the Kurds did. On March 1, the day after Bush halted the Desert Storm war effort, Iraqi Shiites in the south and Kurds in the north began a rebellion against Saddam.\n\nAt first, things went swiftly and well for the Shiites and the Kurds, as a succession of Iraqi cities and towns \u2014 although not Baghdad \u2014 came under their control.\n\nBut the United States never stepped in to assist, and Saddam's military soon regrouped and began a counter-offensive. In fact, the ceasefire negotiated by General H. Norman Schwarzkopf to end Desert Storm helped the Iraqi dictator quell the uprising. The deal prohibited the Iraqi military from using fixed-wing aircraft over the country but allowed helicopters, which Saddam then deployed to bombard the Shiites, who had few surface-to-air missiles or heavy weapons. They were largely defenceless against the helicopters strafing the ground.\n\nIn the north, Iraqi divisions crushed the Kurdish rebellion.\n\nShiite and Kurdish leaders turned to the Americans, begging for help. It did not come. US warplanes in the south did not engage as the Republican Guard wiped out the rebellious Shiites by the thousands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuman Rights Watch reported that \"in their attempts to retake cities, and after consolidating control, loyalist forces killed thousands of unarmed civilians by firing indiscriminately into residential areas\" and \"executing young people on the streets, in homes and in hospitals\". The Iraqi military, HRW said, was shooting people \"en masse\".\n\nPaul Wolfowitz, then the undersecretary of defence for policy, was \"dismayed\", he would say later, by Bush snr's unwillingness to support the Shiite uprising, and particularly by the order that American pilots not shoot down Iraqi military helicopters that were strafing the rebels.\n\nMore than a decade later, president George W. Bush was surrounded by many of the same national security advisers his father had. One in particular, Wolfowitz, was forcefully making the case that it was time for the US to do what it did not in 1991: go after Saddam.\n\nWhen the US finally did enter Iraq in 2003, the Shiites, while welcoming the toppling of Saddam, did not greet the Americans as liberators.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The decision to abandon the Kurds has led to deeper anger within the US military than at any other point in Trump's tenure as commander-in-chief.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4537%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_90/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/11a6e204f24eaaa8bbd4cf2c4f749b8035a1cda0", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
