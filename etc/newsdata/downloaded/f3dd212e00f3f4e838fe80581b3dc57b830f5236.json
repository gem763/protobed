In response to his capture in an upscale neighborhood, hundreds of heavily-armed Sinaloa Cartel henchmen, guns blazing, were pouring into Culiacan, briefly taking the modern city of about a million people near Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast hostage.\n\nWithin hours they had pried him loose from authorities.\n\nIt was like nothing Mexico had seen before, a military-style operation that outfoxed and outnumbered security forces, leaving the city shocked and smoldering. The show of strength dashed hopes the cartel was seriously weakened by the life sentence the elder Guzman received in the United States this year.\n\nNot only were the new generation of Guzmans, collectively known as Los Chapitos, keeping alive their family\u2019s near-mythical outlaw reputation, they were doing it with a brazenness akin to open warfare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a new generation of organized crime that doesn\u2019t respect civilians,\u201d Cristobal Castaneda, head of Sinaloa state security, told Reuters after the attacks.\n\nFour surviving sons of El Chapo were already regulars in Culiacan\u2019s nightclubs and restaurants, despite U.S. indictments against them, before last Thursday\u2019s dramatic act of armed insurrection.\n\nA concrete monument in the parking lot of a Culiacan supermarket marks the spot where a fifth son was gunned down in 2008.\n\nNone of the four are older than their mid-thirties. They have already survived kidnappings, arrest attempts and cartel infighting to establish themselves as the city\u2019s most prominent traffickers, with the support of cartel elders.\n\nThursday\u2019s attacks showed they were capable of taking on the Mexican army, state police and National Guard. Using a mixture of firepower, speed, discipline and the underlying threat of mass civilian deaths, they won.\n\nCastaneda pointed to how over several hours gunmen stormed into businesses and sprayed police with bullets in crowded areas, on a scale unprecedented in the country\u2019s long-running drug war. Remarkably, the government says just 13 people were killed, including a soldier and several cartel gunmen.\n\nFinally, a humbled Mexican government was forced to order Ovidio\u2019s release, opting against a bloodier confrontation that officials later said could have claimed hundreds of lives.\n\nFor many, Ovidio\u2019s newfound celebrity elevated him, along with his brothers, to the status of Sinaloa Cartel heavyweights, with Ovidio\u2019s exploits placing just him a few notches below his father in the pantheon of bandits who outsmarted the government.\n\nA so-called narcocorrido \u2013 a style of song about the drug trade set to upbeat tuba and accordion rhythms \u2013 was released by Sunday, lionizing Ovidio as a \u201cbeast\u201d and proclaiming that \u201cthe government was mistaken/they don\u2019t know who they messed with.\u201d\n\nDespite the high profile antics, it is unclear exactly how much influence the Guzmans have over the cartel their father helped found decades ago, however.\n\nLos Chapitos control drug sales in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, including a growing trade in methamphetamine, according to one official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nEarlier this year, a fentanyl laboratory was found in the city, suggesting that the Guzmans also have their eye on the lucrative U.S. opiate business.\n\nBut the cartel\u2019s bigger interests are still believed to be handled by El Chapo\u2019s former partner, Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, a discrete capo in his early 70s who has never been arrested.\n\nThe businesses Zambada handles move billions of dollars, U.S. authorities say, and are diversified across many sectors in dozens of countries, including even niche markets like wildlife and timber smuggling.\n\nEdgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at Columbia University, agrees that Zambada probably still controls the cartel. He described the new generation as more reckless, but certainly not as powerful.\n\nIn recent years, the relationship between the family and Zambada has been fraught, with his son testifying against El Chapo at his U.S. trial. In turn, the defense argued Zambada was the real head of the cartel, not El Chapo.\n\nHowever, Zambada, who is said to be Ovidio\u2019s godfather, apparently supported the assault to release him. A statement issued on Tuesday under the cartel\u2019s C.D.S insignia was intended as a show of unity between the factions, Buscaglia said.\n\nIn one crackly recording circulating online, purportedly of internal Sinaloa Cartel radio communications on Thursday, a supposed gunman celebrates that Zambada was supporting the battle to release Ovidio.\n\nThursday\u2019s antics showed Ovidio commanded sufficient loyalty in the organization for fighters to risk their lives to save him, Buscaglia said. And despite the cartel\u2019s head-on fight with the state to release him, he predicted Los Chapitos were smart enough avoid sustained confrontation with security forces.\n\n\u201cThey know they would lose in the long term,\u201d he said.\n\nNARCO PRINCES\n\nUp until last week, Ivan Archivaldo, estimated to be 35, and Jesus Alfredo were El Chapo\u2019s better-known sons. Locals say both could be spotted in the city\u2019s trendy nightclubs and restaurants clustered around Culiacan\u2019s upscale Tres Rios neighborhood, where Ovidio was briefly detained by a force of about 35 soldiers.\n\nFar from hiding in safehouses, they and their friends are known to enjoy tearing through Culiacan\u2019s nearby hills in souped-up all terrain vehicles, two people said. Two dealerships that sell high-end models are located in the city.\n\n\u201cYeah, a lot of people here know who they are and see them out and about,\u201d said a young clerk at a clothing shop, asking that her name not be used for fear of reprisals.\n\nIn 2017, Ivan Archivaldo and Jesus Alfredo were believed to be behind an attack on then-rival Damaso Lopez, a high-level Sinaloa Cartel leader once rumored to be El Chapo\u2019s successor, in the dusty town of Villa Juarez just outside Culiacan.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy. The shootout lasted more than two hours. Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta,\u201d said a local witness, mimicking the sound of gunfire and pointing to where bullet holes remain visible. Two people died, including a pregnant woman.\n\nMore than a decade ago, Ivan Archivaldo was arrested and jailed, but he was released in 2008 due to what a judge called a lack of evidence. That same year, El Chapo\u2019s eldest son, Edgar Guzman, was gunned down in a supermarket parking lot in Culiacan, the spot now marked by a stone cross.\n\nFollowing the footsteps of El Chapo, who staged two spectacular prison breaks and eluded capture multiple times, Ivan Archivaldo dodged an imminent arrest in 2014 by dressing as a waiter and fleeing through the kitchen of a high-end seafood restaurant in Culiacan, government sources told Mexico\u2019s Milenio newspaper.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cIt will always be like this,\u201d Ivan Archivaldo said in an interview published last year in Belgian magazine Knack, when asked if there was a war between the cartel and the state.\n\n\u201cIt is the government\u2019s job to fight us, by mandate, they have to fight drug cartels,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who protect me and my family.\u201d\n\n(Corrects to add missing word \u201cof\u201d in paragraph 28)", "description": "The mug shot-style photo of Ovidio Guzman that appeared as he was apprehended oozed defiance.
