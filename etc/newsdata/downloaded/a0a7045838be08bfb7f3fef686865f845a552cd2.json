But when I read or hear about Instagram, none of these \u2014 except for babies \u2014 seem to exist on the app.\n\nIn trend stories and anxious conversations, the focus is almost always on commercial influencers and sponsored content, how the rise of the Instagram-friendly museum is cheapening our experience of art, or how Instagram\u2019s gaze is making us worry about keeping our bodies and our houses in picture-perfect condition. But that\u2019s not all Instagram can be.\n\nOf course, I realize I\u2019m a special case in some ways \u2014 I\u2019m an architecture and design critic. Buildings are my life. But it isn\u2019t that unusual to try to find and follow the tranche of people who love what you love. If you\u2019re in the visual arts, they are probably on Instagram.\n\nThere are plenty of people among Instagram\u2019s 100 million users who march to the beat of their own aesthetic drum, sharing images of places and artifacts that will eventually be transformed into something new that will itself be posted on Instagram. With Instagram, you can copy or you can create. You can use it to contribute more visual delight to the digital world, or you can use it to collect digital souvenirs picked out by other people.", "description": "The app can help expand our love of the designed world and incite our curiosity.
