[When I saw her for the first time], she was with her eldest son and I just bear-hugged her and tried to break the ice in that way,\u2019 she recalled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah we can\u2019t blame her on that one.\n\nHowever, the star went on to add to Tatler: \u2018Our conversations were much more grown up. I felt safer in my own skin to ask questions.\u2019\n\nThe second installment of the Maleficent series, which will see Angelina return as the villainous fairy, picks up years after the original, following Aurora getting engaged.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe trailer opens with Aurora\u2019s engagement, the woman previously cursed by the horned fairy to prick her finger on her 16th birthday and never awaken from the deep sleep that ensued \u2013 unless she receives true loves first kiss.\n\nMaleficent, due to her motherly love of the kid, woke her and in the sequel we see her fight the pull between her love of Aurora and underlying hate for literally everything else.\n\nHowever, despite pulling off the cool queen like no one else could, Angelina recently revealed to Metro.co.uk that her costume is a bit of an occupational hazard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It just feels\u2026familiar. I think the first time I felt so strange being her, I was always knocking into my trailer door with the horns and everything,\u2019 Angelina laughed.\n\nThey definitely look like they could take an eye out.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
