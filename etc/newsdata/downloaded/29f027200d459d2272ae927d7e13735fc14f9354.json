So charmed were the Handel and Haydn Society by the child's exclamation that they asked the public to help find him, hoping to reward the sweet sentiment with a trip to meet the artistic director. Audio of the concert was recorded by WCRB, Boston's classical radio station (and part of the WGBH Foundation).\n\nRonan didn't mean to be disruptive, said his grandfather, Stephen Mattin, who took Ronan to the concert. His grandson, Mattin explained, is on the autism spectrum, and often expresses himself differently than other people.\n\n\"I can count on one hand the number of times that [he's] spontaneously ever come out with some expression of how he's feeling,\" Mattin said.\n\nMattin said that his sister-in-law saw on television that the Handel and Haydn Society was searching for the \"wow kid,\" and the family, who lives in Kensington, New Hampshire, reached out soon after. The Society has invited them to meet the artistic director, and they are figuring out a date.\n\nRonan is a huge music fan, his grandfather said. He took the 9-year-old to another concert in Boston a few months ago, and he \"talked about nothing else for weeks,\" he said. Ronan loves taking trips to visit the Museum of Science and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Mattin said, and he was excited for Sunday's concert.\n\nMozart makes us feel that way, too!

Everybody has different ways of expressing themselves,\" Mattin said. \"I think people in general, society's becoming more tolerant or understanding of the differences between people.\"", "description": "Nine-year-old Ronan Mattin was so swept away by the music that he loudly exclaimed \u2014 for the packed auditorium to hear \u2014 \"Wow!\"", "authors": ["Hannah Uebele", "Under The Radar Staff", "Anastasia Tsioulcas"], "top_image": "https://wgbh.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b5e0350/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwgbh.brightspotcdn.com%2Fd4%2F66%2F051f178b489fbe78dd37c2043805%2Fronanfinal.png", "published_at": "2019-05-09"}
