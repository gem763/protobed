During the campaign, the 33-year-old leader stressed he wants \"proper center-right politics\" for his country, which might be difficult with either the Social Democrats or the Greens. At the same time, giving a coalition with the far right another go could be a risky move.\n\nHis previous attempt to govern with the Freedom Party ended in a spectacular breakdown over the so-called Ibiza scandal shortly before this year's European election. Leaked footage appeared to show the far-right party's then-leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, attempting to trade lucrative government contracts for campaign support from a woman he believed to be a wealthy Russian.\n\nKurz pulled the plug on the government, and the Freedom Party then teamed up with the Social Democrats to oust him in a no-confidence motion \u2014 turning Kurz from the celebrated wunderkind of European conservatism into Austria's shortest-serving chancellor, his term in office over after just 18 months. A technocratic interim government subsequently took over.\n\nThe Ibiza affair hasn't dented support for the People's Party. Nor did a series of accusations of misconduct over the course of the campaign, allegations that ranged from the shredding of hard drives to creative accounting and hidden donations. (The party denies any wrongdoing.)\n\n\"I'm overwhelmed, I'm almost speechless. It's been a tough four months [but] today the people have voted us back in\" \u2014 Sebastian Kurz on the election results\n\nOn Sunday, the People's Party exceeded both its European election result and poll estimates, which had put it at about 34 percent, prompting the party's election headquarters to erupt in jubilant applause and chants of \"Chancellor Kurz\" after the first exit polls were published.\n\n\"I'm overwhelmed, I'm almost speechless,\" Kurz told his supporters on Sunday evening. \"It's been a tough four months [but] today the people have voted us back in.\"\n\nThe Freedom Party, on the other hand, suffered severe losses \u2014 taking 16.1 percent of the vote, down from 26 percent in 2017 and 17 percent in the European election, slipping into third place behind the Social Democrats.\n\nThat loss prompted some far-right leaders to change tune. The Freedom Party spent much of its campaign making overtures to Kurz, hoping to convince him to get back together \u2014 one bizarre campaign video depicted Norbert Hofer, who took over as Freedom Party leader after Strache's resignation, in couples' therapy with Kurz.\n\nOn Sunday, however, senior Freedom Party members suggested they would prefer the opposition benches. Hofer said 16 percent is \"no mandate for a progressive entry into coalition talks.\" Deputy leader Herbert Kickl said the result means the party would not have sufficient influence within a coalition and that its \"mandate\" was to be in opposition.\n\nKurz, meanwhile, declined to rule out any coalition or talk specifics about potential alliances after the election.\n\nA new coalition with the Freedom Party would bring risks. The far-right party is, for example, already embroiled in another scandal involving Strache, this time over generous and allegedly fraudulent expenses. (Strache denies any wrongdoing.)\n\nBut according to a survey commissioned by public broadcaster ORF, People's Party voters would still favor teaming up with the Freedom Party over a coalition with the Greens or the Social Democrats. Their favored coalition partner, the liberal NEOS, only won 7.8 percent, making a two-party coalition with it numerically impossible.\n\nThe Social Democrats \u2014 which on Sunday took 21.7 percent, the worst result in the party's post-war history \u2014 governed with the People's Party until 2017, when Kurz became party leader and decided to terminate the coalition. Neither party has explicitly ruled out a \"grand coalition\" between the center right and center left, but skepticism about such an alliance abounds on both sides.\n\nThe Austrian Greens, meanwhile, celebrated their return to parliament after failing to cross the threshold of necessary votes amid a party split in 2017. Boosted by growing concerns about climate change, they scored their best-ever result with 14 percent.\n\nA potential two-party coalition involving the Greens became a surprise option on Sunday, with pre-election polls having underestimated both the environmentalists and the People's Party. A three-party coalition of the People's Party, the Greens and the NEOS is now less likely, given the latter is not necessary to form a majority.\n\nIf Kurz decides on a centrist alliance, or if the Freedom Party makes good on its word and opts for the opposition benches, Austria could face lengthy coalition talks as the People's Party tries to find common ground with one of the left-leaning parties.\n\nSigi Maurer, a Greens politician, told Austrian media that the People's Party would have to undergo a \"complete change\" for a viable coalition with her party. But she added that the Greens would \"not run away from talks \u2014 we will seek them.\"", "description": "The former Austrian chancellor\u2019s party comes a clear first.", "authors": ["Zia Weise", "Matthew Karnitschnig"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1172132027-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
