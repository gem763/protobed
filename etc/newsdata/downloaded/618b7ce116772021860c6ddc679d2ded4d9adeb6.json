But repeated delay is not sustainable in the long run.\u201d With the economy already showing signs of decay, no deal or a delay would leave businesses \u201cstarting again at square one, but this time having to deal with significant economic challenges at the same time.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cNo deal would represent complete failure from politicians on all sides. The majority of our members have said they cannot be ready for this scenario by the end of this month. It would plunge trade and supply chains with our biggest partner into jeopardy without achieving a single thing.\u201d\n\nAn IoD poll of its members found that only 13% feel fully prepared for a 31 October no deal. Asked which is worse for their business: 51% said no deal, 32% a further extension.\n\nCBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said \u201cThis is not a perfect deal, but we can work with it. This does feel like a step forward.\u201d\n\nTory peer Lord Rose, now chairman of Ocado campaigned for the UK to Remain in the EU. He said: \u201cI\u2019m involved in businesses in the car industry and the food industry and the clothing industry and I can tell you that people in the businesses that I\u2019m involved in, they want to move on.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Catherine McKinnell MP, interim Chair of the Treasury Committee, has written to Chancellor Sajid Javid, demanding fresh economic analysis on Brexit. She said the committee asked \u201cwhether the Government has updated its economic analysis of Brexit three months ago, yet we are still awaiting a response. It is unacceptable that the committee has not received this information from HM Treasury.\u201d\n\n", "description": "SOME of Britain\u2019s top business leaders and lobby groups today pleaded with MPs to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal or risk plunging the nation into further turmoil that would cost jobs and investment.Even leading Remain campaigners such as former Marks & Spencer chief executive Lord Rose said it was", "authors": ["Simon English"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lFCyQlDIlgIZBd1RBnxcng--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/f50387f5ece1d50f30bc0254263291f2", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
