What is simultaneously the most exciting thing to tell someone and the most boring to hear about? A dream. The interesting sort is your own. And the kind that evoke politely muffled yawns are those belonging to other people. Really. When was the last time you heard someone say \u201cI had the weirdest dream last night\u201d and you responded with something other than a sardonic, \u201cOh?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReading Zadie Smith\u2019s latest short-story collection, Grand Union, is like listening to hour upon hour of tales about someone else\u2019s dreams. The stories are well written because Smith is a terrific writer. The characters are well drawn because that is Smith\u2019s forte. Much of it is striking and much of it is memorable. And yet the stories are frustratingly fragmented and incoherent \u2014 strange and impenetrable as the subconscious itself.\n\nMy main gripe is that the stories are more or less meaningless. Page after page, we await the moment when Smith will tell us what \u2014 beyond the immediate \u2014 they\u2019re about. When she will say, as other dreamers do, \u201cAnd, of course, this all must have come from the conversation I had with my husband about having the spare room painted. Which was really about us trying for a baby.\u201d Of course, she could do it in a far more sophisticated way than that if she liked. But she never does.\n\nThe collection is made up of 19 short stories: an additional eleven to the eight already published in The New Yorker, Granta, and The Paris Review. The first third of the book is weaker than the rest. Story No. 2, \u201cSentimental Education,\u201d is about the political discussions, drugs, and sex (mostly the sex) had by some bright college kids. \u201cThe Lazy River\u201d is an elaborate metaphor for life itself: \u201cYesterday the Lazy River was green. Nobody knows why. Theories abound. They all involve urine.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust Right\u201d centers on a family in Greenwich Village before the war and has some fine passages, such as the following one, which uses understatement to distill racial divisions and the casual cruelty of children: \u201cThe pairing was to be achieved alphabetically, as if a third of the class wasn\u2019t coloured and Walter Ulbricht didn\u2019t have a port-wine stain eating half of his face.\u201d The stories set in New York City are compelling and make clear Smith\u2019s intimate knowledge of the place. For instance, she writes:\n\nThree benches along sits Abraham Lincoln. Same beard, same face, and he\u2019s got an outfit that works. It\u2019s not a costume, exactly, but the general impression is that this is basically what Lincoln would wear if he were alive today and spent his days between MacDougal, Thompson and the park.\n\nWeirdly, I know exactly whom she is talking about. There\u2019s nothing fictional about him. Last year, I conversed with Mr. Lincoln at St. Joseph\u2019s soup kitchen on Sixth Avenue. That man was born to be written about. He knows it, too.\n\nAnticipating her reader\u2019s discombobulation, Smith provides us with a breakdown of her postmodern narrative method. \u201cWelcome to the Narrative Techniques Worksheet!\u201d reads the first sentence of the so-called story \u201cParent\u2019s Morning Epiphany.\u201d Under instructive headlines such as \u201cShow the Resolution\u201d and \u201cClarity of Ideas\u201d Smith leaves cunning clues, such as \u201cPlot is not my strong point\u201d and \u201cIt may have gone over my head.\u201d Ho ho \u2014 she is taunting her reviewer \u2014 I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cThe writing lacks definition and structure.\u201d I dare you to say it now that I\u2019ve mentioned it myself. Okay. The writing lacks definition and structure. It does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs there more to this than meets the eye? Back in 2000, a year after the then-24-year-old Smith had published her critically acclaimed debut novel, White Teeth, the literary critic James Wood wrote an essay for The New Republic with Smith\u2019s book as his primary target. Wood argued that the effect of bizarre plot devices paired with implausible characters and self-serious social criticism was an \u201cexhausted\u201d and \u201coverworked\u201d attempt at realism. It was \u201chysterical realism,\u201d Wood said. The young Smith responded humbly that this was a \u201cpainfully accurate term for the sort of overblown, manic prose to be found in novels like my own.\u201d But two decades later, her apologetic self-consciousness seems to have mellowed into ironic detachment. Fair enough, I suppose. \u201cFor those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like,\u201d as Muriel Spark wrote in her unbeatable novel The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrand Union improves after the ironic technical explanation. \u201cDowntown\u201d \u2014 possibly my favorite \u2014 is about an artist in New York who is irritated when another artist, visiting from a Hungarian forest, says, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can live here, and be an artist, amongst all this social noise and all of these people.\u201d Another colorful story is the amusing \u201cMiss Adele Amidst the Corsets,\u201d about a performer who is \u201cno linguist, and no geographer\u201d but is rather an aging drag queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no denying that Smith\u2019s prose style is glorious. She is rather like a person striking matches in a cave: The reader sees, if only for a split second, flashing images in the darkness. Egyptian hieroglyphs. Dancing bears. A couple making love.\n\nAbout the lovemaking \u2014 the sex scenes in Grand Union are grossly overwritten. Pointlessly shocking and shockingly pointless. It oughtn\u2019t to be thought prudish to complain about this. Smith is a writer who is capable of so much more than cheap Hollywood tricks. And gratuitous lingering on bodily fluids, etc. feels like something designed to divert and distract us from . . . well, quite. What are these stories about?\n\nThe most redeeming features of Grand Union are the well-sketched characters and how they interact. \u201cEscape from New York\u201d plays off the urban legend that Michael Jackson drove Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando out of New York City in the aftermath of 9/11. From the dialogue:\n\n\u201cThere are no flights allowed,\u201d Michael said, trying to feel capable, filling them in. \u201cNo one can charter. Not even the very important people.\u201d \u201cBullshit!\u201d Marlon said. \u201cYou think Weinstein\u2019s not on a plane right now?\u201d \u201cMarlon, in case you\u2019ve forgotten,\u201d Elizabeth said, \u201cI am also a Jew. Am I on a plane, Marlon? Am I on a plane?\u201d Marlon groaned. \u201cOh, for Chrissake. I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s tempting for Smith, who has strong (if predictable) political views, as evidenced in her essay collection Feel Free (2018), to make her characters liberal puppets commenting on Brexit and Trump and whatever else seems topical. But they are nothing of the sort. Smith is too smart for that. And if Grand Union falls short, it is only because she has so far to fall. Smith scatters literary brilliance to the winds, forcing the reader to go to the enormous effort of piecing it all together. It\u2019s a big ask. To be honest, I read Grand Union cover to cover only because I was writing about it. Fully awake and autonomous, I\u2019d probably close it at page 20, let out a yawn, and lay my head down to enjoy the sort of dreams that we all find more interesting: our own.\n\nThis article appears as \u201cDull Dreams\u201d in the October 14, 2019, print edition of National Review.", "description": "A review of 'Grand Union: Stories,' by Zadie Smith.", "authors": ["Madeleine Kearns", "Kyle Smith", "Kevin D.
