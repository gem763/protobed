My sense of adventure is very much still intact and I know I\u2019m not the only one \u2013 so why are us golden oldies so readily written off?\n\nOlder people are likely to be stereotyped as frail, ill and dependent and to be viewed as having low social status. Findings from the European Social Study revealed people aged 70 and over are seen as contributing relatively little to the economy and being a \u2018burden on health services\u2019. In fact they contribute \u00a3152 billion to the economy through work, caregiving and volunteering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that such negative views are so frequently expressed and perpetuated.\n\nI like to think that perhaps youngsters buy into this stereotyping because they\u2019re jealous of our been-there-done-that confidence, only authentically displayed by someone who has a good fistful of decades in the bank of life?\n\nMore truthfully though, I think it\u2019s often forgotten that \u2013 despite a slight slowing of the pace of our lives, changes in our health and the level of collagen in our skin \u2013 we are still individuals with passions, interests, desires and great stories to tell.\n\nDo David Attenborough, Meryl Streep or June Brown feel the need to take to their bed with tea and slippers just because they\u2019ve reached a certain age? I think not.\n\nWe have a lot to offer and most of us are still a lot of fun. We desperately need to rehabilitate the image of what it means to be older.\n\nWhen I think of the most active and inspirational people in the public eye, a good handful of them would qualify for a free bus pass. But are Oprah Winfrey or Morgan Freeman swapping the red carpet for a bingo hall?\n\nDo David Attenborough, Meryl Streep or June Brown feel the need to take to their bed with tea and slippers just because they\u2019ve reached a certain age? I think not.\n\nThese trailblazers are the positive role models our generation so needs.\n\nI\u2019m taking a leaf out Meryl\u2019s book. I\u2019m not going to behave like I\u2019ve nothing left to offer just because society expects it of me, and nor should anyone who\u2019s considered \u2018old\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI believe there\u2019s absolutely no reason why I should lose my joie-de-vivre as I reach the peak of life.\n\nAs we reach older age, we should use our savings and our sense to pursue what really makes us happy, rather than bowing to society\u2019s expectation that we are diminished with every year that passes.\n\nNot to mention the fact that physical activity has been identified by Age UK as one of the key factors in promoting and enhancing overall quality of life for older people.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I feel more vivacious and fabulous now than I ever have. It might be something to do with refusing to \u2018act my age\u2019, as I chase after adventures, activities and new challenges.\n\nI\u2019m taking a leaf out Meryl\u2019s book (Picture: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for TIFF)\n\nI\u2019ve scoffed kangaroo bits in the I\u2019m A Celeb Jungle, strutted my stuff on the Come Dance with Me for Comic Relief stage, and survived the rollercoaster-ride that is Celebrity Big Brother.\n\nEach experience taught me something new about myself and I don\u2019t regret getting out of my comfort zone for one second.\n\nI know full well that not all of us older people are able to go skydiving, bungee jumping or on holiday to Thailand. Financial and health constraints can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nBut it is possible for everyone to find an adventure that keeps them smiling and helps them feel alive.\n\nI\u2019m done with the pigeon-holing and stereotyping that contributes to a lack of confidence in later life, and want to encourage my fellow over-65-ers to step out of their comfort zone, grab a hold of that inner confidence, and reclaim their sense of adventure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis doesn\u2019t have to mean doing something completely outrageous \u2013 but something that feels adventurous to you. Whatever your age, state of health, level of mobility or financial status, there\u2019s always something you can do to bring back that youthful vitality.\n\nBig or small, it\u2019s time to do something that makes you feel like the winner you are.\n\nI\u2019m calling for us golden oldies to stop behaving like society might expect. Hang up your dressing gown and dig out an outfit which makes you feel a million dollars.\n\nBuy yourself an advent calendar and eat all the chocolates in one sitting. Re-paint your living room in a colour which your niece thinks is too loud.\n\nTake the grandkids to the park and have a go on the swings. Call up your friends and plan a night on the tiles.\n\nYou can show the youngsters how to do it properly. Trust me my loves \u2013 it\u2019s the little adventures which will give you a whole new lease of life.\n\nMost importantly, promise me you\u2019ll never tell yourself that you\u2019re too old to do something you love.\n\nKim Woodburn is supporting Red Letter Days.\n\nMORE: Kim Woodburn \u2018honoured\u2019 by epic impression on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: How to help the hero plumber who refuses to charge elderly people\n\nMORE: Elderly identical twins, 95, thanks \u2018no sex and lots of Guinness\u2019 as secrets to their long lives\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Kim Woodburn writes for Metro.co.uk on what growing older means to her.", "authors": ["Kim Woodburn", "Tv Personality"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-633717440_1572084121.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
