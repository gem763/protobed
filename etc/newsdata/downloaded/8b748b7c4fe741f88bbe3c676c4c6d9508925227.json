You did not confirm it in anyway shape or form it\u2019s 50 carrots [carrot emoji] of vvs vvs1 s1 and s2 diamonds. In white gold 18 K If you gotta issue and are gonna talk behind my back say it to my face again. B***H!!\u2019 he wrote.\n\nAaron aimed an expletive-filled rant at Logan (Picture: Twitter/AaronCarter)\n\nHe added: \u2018I already got suny making my own chain for me and a lot of people think you\u2019re a f***ing douche and I was a fan of you until what I just found out. Literally suck my d*** @LoganPaul you\u2019re a p***y. They do anything for clout. This fool asked ME to go on his podcast and won\u2019t stfu.\u2019\n\nAppearing to challenge Logan to a fight, he later wrote: \u2018I\u2019m waiting on him. Mike Tyson will train me in a nano second @MikeTyson & I\u2019ll whoop dat ass. He don\u2019t wanna catch these hands I\u2019m not playing @LoganPaul.\u2019\n\nFinishing his rant, he said: \u2018Ain\u2019t nobody asked you to follow me. Lol, ain\u2019t nobody asked to be on your podcast @LoganPaul. I spent two days making that sweater. F*** this!! Waste of my precious beautiful energy.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOuch.\n\nHowever, Logan hasn\u2019t addressed the comments publicly, seeming a little more preoccupied with his fight against KSI and the upcoming London press conference.\n\nRecently tweeting about the long-awaited conference, he said: \u2018London see u monday. pls don\u2019t stab me.\u2019\n\nSounds like a reasonable request to be fair.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
