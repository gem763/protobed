Before Sanders, Debs was the most successful socialist candidate in American history, winning hundreds of thousands of votes in the final four of his five campaigns for president. He won 6 percent of the national popular vote in 1912, the equivalent, in 2016 numbers, of more than eight million votes\n\nDebs was best known for his thundering attacks on industrial capitalism. A tireless campaigner, he crisscrossed the country denouncing the inhumane conditions of factory labor and berating the capitalist class for its destructive obsession with profit. \u201cIn the wage system you and your children, and your children\u2019s children, if capitalism shall prevail until they are born, are condemned to slavery and there is no possible hope unless by throwing over the capitalists and voting for socialism,\u201d Debs declared in a speech delivered at an Independence Day celebration in Chicago in 1901.\n\nBut Debs didn\u2019t just condemn his class enemies. He also called on his audiences to imagine a better world \u2014 to realize the democratic and egalitarian promise of the American Revolution through collective action. \u201cWe live in the most favored land beneath the unbending sky,\u201d he said in a speech in 1900. \u201cWe have all the raw materials and the most marvelous machinery, millions of eager inhabitants seeking employment. Nothing is so easily produced as wealth, and no man should suffer for the need of it.\u201d Debs\u2019s appeal, noted the historian Nick Salvatore in his 1982 biography, \u201cEugene V. Debs: Citizen and Socialist,\u201d was \u201cfrequently described by contemporaries as evangelical, and transcended at that moment factional disagreements and led each in the audience to glimpse a different social order.\u201d\n\nOr, as one self-described \u201chard-bitten socialist\u201d said to the journalist Heywood Broun at the time: \u201cThat old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man. And that\u2019s not the funniest part of it. As long as he\u2019s around, I believe it myself.\u201d", "description": "From Debs to Sanders to Ocasio-Cortez, an ideal persists.", "authors": ["Jamelle Bouie"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/opinion/22bouie2/merlin_163024719_5c83f2c4-d0aa-4a8c-9aa3-b80bbdc810a0-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
