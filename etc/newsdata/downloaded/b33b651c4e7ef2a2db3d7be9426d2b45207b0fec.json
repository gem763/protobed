Instead of celebrating it's re-emergence, the poor reptile was stoned to death by villagers, a report in the Times of India stated.\n\nThe 5.11 feet-long female gharial was seen at a sliding gate of one of the tributaries of the Ai river in the Nijlaguri area of Chirang district bordering Bhutan on Monday.\n\nNot knowing what to do next, the locals panicked at seeing the huge reptile and ended up killing it. According to officials, the gharial might have strayed and swum from Bhutan as they were previous instances of gharial sightings in the Assam rivers.\n\nbccl/representational image\n\n\"It is believed that by 1980s, the gharial went locally extinct from the river system of Assam. So, there is a high chance of the gharial sighted in Chirang coming from the captive gharial breeding centre in Bhutan.\n\nDon't Miss 105 SHARES 10.8 K SHARES 15.5 K SHARES 8.7 K SHARES 3.6 K SHARES\n\nIn the past, stray gharials from Bhutan were sighted in the rivers of western Assam which originate in the neighbouring country,\" said wildlife biologist Md Firoze Ahmed as quoted to as saying by TOI.\n\nThere were sightings of gharials, distinct from its cousins like crocodiles or alligators with its elongated and slender mouth, in the Brahmaputra at Hajo in Assam's Kamrup district in 2001 and in the Manas river in 2006.

This can happen through scientific reintroduction of the species along with mass awareness campaign that they are not harmful to humans. \"For this to happen, we first have to find out suitable habitats in the river system\", he said.\n\nbccl/representational image\n\nAs they are reptiles, they need sufficient and undisturbed space along the river banks for basking. We have to find out locations where the river banks are undisturbed if we go for gharial reintroduction programme,\" added Ahmed.", "description": "The gharial, which has gone locally extinct from Assam's river system, has resurfaced again.
