But a source in Mr. Pence\u2019s office said that no such trip had been planned.\n\nAnd when Hurricane Dorian led Mr. Trump to cancel an early-September trip to Warsaw on which he was set to meet with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Pence traveled in place of the president. While there, on Sept. 2, Mr. Pence denied to reporters that he had discussed the elder Mr. Biden with the Ukrainian leader.\n\n\u201cThe president asked me to meet with President Zelensky and to talk about the progress that he\u2019s making on a broad range of areas,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cAnd we did that.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence did not directly respond to a question at the time about whether the Trump administration had held up $391 million in military aid for the country this summer in order to further pressure Mr. Zelensky\u2019s government. Instead he cited Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint that Europe has not done more to assist Ukraine, adding that \u201cas President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.\u201d\n\nBy that time, Mr. Trump\u2019s public remarks had already conflated well-established concerns about endemic corruption in Ukrainian society with his more personalized notion of corruption in the country \u2014 namely the alleged activities of the Bidens and unfounded theories that it was Ukraine\u2019s government that meddled in the 2016 election, not Russia\u2019s.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s critics say that despite the vice president\u2019s professions of ignorance about the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s political agenda in Ukraine, he knew enough about the president\u2019s mixing of foreign policy and politics to be implicated in any wrongdoing.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Pence appears to have been almost willfully oblivious to Mr. Trump\u2019s public obsession with Ukraine, the Bidens and conspiracy theories surrounding the 2016 election that have also been amplified in public by Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.", "description": "The vice president has risen to his boss\u2019s defense at a moment of crisis that some Republicans fear could inflict lasting damage on them both.", "authors": ["Michael Crowley", "Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/us/politics/03dc-pence/03dc-pence-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
