My adopted homeland has great health care, clean cities, gorgeous lakes, and yes, fries topped with cheese curds and gravy\u2014a Quebecois delicacy known as poutine.\n\nBut one thing you won\u2019t find in Canada is low fees for mutual funds. According to a report issued on Tuesday by Morningstar, Canada has some of the highest expense ratios for mutual funds among 26 countries surveyed.\n\nThe median expense ratio for equity funds in Canada was 1.98% in 2018, higher than all but two other countries: Italy and Taiwan. Canada had the most-expensive allocation funds (which combine stocks and bonds) of every country surveyed, at 1.94%. Its median expense ratio for bond funds was 0.99%, ranking 20th worldwide.\n\nMorningstar surveyed fees for open-end mutual funds but didn\u2019t include exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and other types of pooled investment vehicles. The report doesn\u2019t include a median fund fee worldwide. However, it does make some interesting comparisons among countries and types of funds: equity, fixed income, and allocation.\n\nThe good news for investors is that fund fees are generally falling worldwide. Fees are coming down because of increased competition in the fund industry, regulatory initiatives to promote fee transparency, and the rise of index funds and low-cost ETFs. A worldwide shift from actively managed funds to index funds is pushing asset-weighted expense ratios down.\n\nThe U.S. mutual-fund industry\u2014the largest and deepest market in the world\u2014scores quite well. Among the countries surveyed, the U.S. ranked second worldwide for equity funds, with a median expense ratio of 0.59%. U.S. allocation funds rank first at a median 0.60%. However, U.S. bond funds aren\u2019t close to the cheapest. That distinction goes to Switzerland, where the median expense ratio was 0.26%, well below the 0.42% median in the U.S. (which lands the U.S. in sixth place worldwide).\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nFees are low in the U.S. because of the breadth of the market, widespread availability of no-load funds, and intense competition from ETFs. \u201cAmerican investors benefit from the strong competition and economies of scale,\u201d says Grant Kennaway, a co-author of the Morningstar report. About 20% of U.S. fund assets are in index funds, a higher percentage than in any other country. And it is much more common for investors to buy no-load funds on their own or work with a fee-based advisor; share classes that have a front-end load are seeing steady outflows and account for only 29% of assets, a lower proportion than in other countries, where commission-based share classes remain common.\n\nThere is also the 800-pound gorilla in the room\u2014Vanguard Group. Morningstar\u2019s report singles out Vanguard for its \u201cinfluence on the fee landscape.\u201d Vanguard predominantly sells index funds, operating at \u201cenormous scale in a mutual ownership structure\u201d and selling funds at prices \u201cwell below the norm,\u201d the report says. Vanguard\u2019s asset-weighted expense ratio was 0.09% at the end of 2018, and Vanguard oversees more than $5.2 trillion in assets, nearly a quarter of the $21.4 trillion industry (including ETFs).\n\nOne other country that does a good job of keeping fund fees down is the Netherlands. The Dutch rank first worldwide for equity fund fees at 0.50% (for locally domiciled funds). Holland\u2019s allocation funds are also inexpensive at 0.64%, ranking second worldwide. Its bond fund cost 0.50%, ranking in 10th place.\n\nAs for Canada, its fund fees are so steep because they embed the cost of investment advice as part of the expense ratio. Funds tend to be sold through Canada\u2019s Big Five banks, and fund expense ratios typically include commissions or trailing asset-based charges for investment advice (the equivalent of 12b-1 fees in the U.S.).\n\n\u201cThe asset-management industry in Canada has a lot of power,\u201d says Christina West, a co-author of the Morningstar study. \u201cThere\u2019s a long tradition of funds being sold through the banks.\u201d About 75% of the assets in Canadian mutual funds are in commission-based share classes, and they have the highest fees (averaging 2.28% for equity funds). About 22% of fund assets are in fee-based share classes (in which the investor pays a separate fee to the advisor), and just 3% of assets are in do-it-yourself share classes.\n\nUnbundling the cost of advice from expense ratios is gaining traction in the Canadian financial market as more investors opt for fee-based advisors, Morningstar says in its report. But the vast majority of funds still pay a fee called a \u201cretrocession\u201d to the distributor\u2014typically the bank that sponsors and sells the fund. Investors typically pay a 1% retrocession for equity funds and 0.50% for fixed-income funds, Morningstar says. Those fees probably won\u2019t go away soon. A proposal to phase out retrocession fees was initially approved by regulators in every Canadian province, but Ontario reversed its decision, according to Morningstar, \u201ceffectively putting an end\u201d to eliminating the fees.\n\nWhy did Ontario say no? The province is home to Toronto, the financial capital and the seat of financial power in the country. Canada\u2019s banks may simply have told the regulators, \u201cNo thanks.\u201d\n\nCanada is now less progressive on fund fees than India, China, Taiwan, and South Africa. Even Italy keeps fees lower for its allocation funds. Granted, Canadian bacon may not be nearly as tasty as Italian guanciale. But come on, Canada, we think you can do a bit better, eh?\n\nWrite to Daren Fonda at daren.fonda@barrons.com", "description": "According to a report by Morningstar, Canada has some of the highest expense ratios for mutual funds among 26 countries surveyed.
