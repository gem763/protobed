Breitbart News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFacebook News will feature content from almost 200 publishers including the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters that if any Facebook News publisher posts misinformation, the publisher would no longer be eligible for Facebook News.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Elizabeth Culliford; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "description": "The ad, which ran on Friday, was put up as a stunt by a left-leaning Political Action Committee, or PAC, called The Really Online Lefty League, to test Facebook's political ad policies.
