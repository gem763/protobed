Wade is ultimately reversed through his influence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that President Donald Trump is delivering substantial pro-life victories,\u201d Foster told Charles Camosy when asked whether Trump was indeed the most pro-life president. \u201cAnd his transformation of the judiciary through his work with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has the potential to ensure judges properly interpret the Constitution for decades to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, the majority of President Trump\u2019s pro-life achievements have come by means of executive order or other administrative action,\u201d said the head of America\u2019s oldest national pro-life organization. \u201cAnd all those achievements can be reversed when, inevitably, another president with different views enters office.\u201d\n\nUnder Foster\u2019s guidance, AUL has pursued a mother-child strategy that defends the interests and vulnerabilities of both, protecting them from abortion industry abuses. Foster has testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Select Investigative Panel and Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.\n\n\u201cWhile we have not seen permanent victories for life, in many respects that\u2019s not his failure, but the Congress\u2019s failure,\u201d Foster continued. \u201cWe cannot forget the disaster that was the House of Representatives\u2019 total failure to defund Planned Parenthood when they had the chance to deliver an historic and life-affirming legislative victory for the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to squander those opportunities to deliver permanent legislative achievements that support the human right to life,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to Foster, Trump\u2019s pro-life legacy will ultimately depend on actions by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cBut in the long run, I suspect President Trump\u2019s pro-life bona fides will be judged by whether the U.S. Supreme Court reverses Roe,\u201d she said.\n\nMany legal scholars consider Roe to be one of the worst rulings in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court, independent of where one stands on the abortion issue. Even liberal academics such as Yale law professor John Hart Ely and Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, as well Alan Dershowitz, Cass Sunstein, and Kermit Roosevelt have criticized Roe as bad jurisprudence.\n\nAs one scholar noted, Roe \u201cwas poorly reasoned and not grounded in law, giving it little intellectual legitimacy.\u201d\n\nRow v. Wade has been compared to the notorious Dred Scott decision by the Court that denied the rights of blacks and has been referred to by some as a \u201ctravesty\u201d of constitutional law.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The president of Americans United for Life said that President Trump may well deserve the title of most pro-life president in U.S. history.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
