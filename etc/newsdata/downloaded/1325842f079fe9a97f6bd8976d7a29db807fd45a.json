REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nKoizumi, 38, became the third youngest lawmaker to join a post-World War Two Japanese cabinet when Abe announced a reshuffle on Wednesday.\n\nKoizumi, popularly referred to as Shinjiro to distinguish him from his father, grabbed headlines last month with news he would marry soon and become a father.\n\nHe announced he would wed Christel Takigawa, 42, a French-Japanese television personality known as the face of Tokyo\u2019s successful bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\n\nKoizumi was quoted in media as saying he was considering taking paternity leave after the child was born early next year, a controversial move in Japan where women are still often expected to take the lead in child-rearing.\n\nHe has spoken in favour of letting married couples use separate surnames, media reported, a practice banned for official documents under current law.\n\nAs environment minister, Koizumi could be in an awkward spot given Abe\u2019s commitment to nuclear power. The elder Koizumi, now retired from parliament, became a harsh critic of atomic energy after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis.\n\nThe closest Koizumi had come to a cabinet post previously was his 2014 appointment as parliamentary vice minister for reconstruction of the tsunami-hit Tohoku region.\n\n\u201cUntil now, Shinjiro has been mostly performance and it is not clear how much policy know-how he has,\u201d said University of Tokyo professor Yu Uchiyama. \u201cNow that will become clear.\u201d\n\nKoizumi has suggested in the past that taking a high-profile post too soon was risky, but some who know him said he might not want to wait too long before seeking the premiership.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a young guy in a hurry,\u201d said one political source speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nAbe, who returned to power in December 2012 promising to reboot the economy and bolster defence, is on track to become Japan\u2019s longest-serving premier in November.\n\nHis tenure as Liberal Democratic Party leader, which ensures the premiership if the LDP stays in power, ends in September 2021. Party rules need to be changed if he wants another term.\n\nKoizumi shares some of Abe\u2019s conservative views \u2014 he has paid his respects at Tokyo\u2019s controversial Yasukuni Shrine for war dead \u2014 but voted for a rival in a 2012 party leadership election. He has shaped his image as a reformer but taken care not to offend party elders.\n\nKoizumi graduated from a private Japanese university in Japan and has a master\u2019s degree from New York\u2019s Columbia University. In 2009 - the LDP was knocked out of power for three years - he won a lower house seat vacated by his father.", "description": "Japan's new Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of charismatic former Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, is regularly rated by voters as the lawmaker they'd like most to see in the top job when Abe steps down.", "authors": ["Linda Sieg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428587151&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0CM", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
