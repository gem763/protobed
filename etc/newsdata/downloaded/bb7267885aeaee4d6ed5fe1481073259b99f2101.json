And I know a lot of the guys are the same way.\u201d\n\nMyers is among the roughly one-third of American workers who say they\u2019ve changed how they act at work in the past year, as the #MeToo movement has focused the nation\u2019s attention on sexual misconduct and highlighted issues of racial and ethnic diversity at the same time, according to a new poll of Americans who are full- or part-time employees.\n\nThe survey, conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in collaboration with the software company SAP, also found that about a third of all working adults say they have talked about sexual misconduct in the workplace with coworkers in the past year.\n\n\u201cI have worked construction. And I grew up during that time period, where banter of that type was much more free,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI have had to watch what I say. \u2026 If I find that it would be offensive to a woman, I know that there are men that are just as sensitive.\u201d\n\nThe poll finds American workers view the #MeToo movement more favorably than unfavorably, 45% versus 27%. Half of women had a favorable opinion, compared with 4 in 10 men; just over 3 in 10 men view the movement unfavorably.\n\nThose who say they have been subjected to workplace sexual misconduct are especially likely to view the movement favorably, compared with of those who say they have not been victims of misconduct, 60% versus 42%.\n\nAbout half of working adults think things will change for the better for working women in general as a result of the recent high-profile sexual misconduct cases. And as a result of recent focus on issues of racial and ethnic diversity, about 4 in 10 working adults think change for the better is likely for African Americans, while about a third say the same for workers of Hispanic origin.\n\nStill, the poll found that few Americans expect positive change will come to their own workplace or for them personally. Count ShaeTiaunna Green, 26, a cashier from Wyoming, Michigan, among them.\n\nGreen, who is African American and a lesbian, said she\u2019s hoping for positive change, but she\u2019s not optimistic.\n\nStill, she said she has thrived in diverse workplaces, so when she applied for her current job at a supermarket last year, she made sure it was diverse and had inclusive policies. The poll finds that diversity and inclusion policies are much more important to black and Hispanic workers than to white workers and are slightly more important to women than to men.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure that was an aspect, and so that I knew that everyone had an equal opportunity and I wouldn\u2019t be excluded from certain opportunities,\u201d she said.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 working Americans say their employer has established new training on harassment in the workplace, instituted new policies about harassment or introduced new training on workplace diversity in the last two years. Most of those who say their workplace has made any of those changes think it\u2019s had a positive impact.\n\nJason Phillips, 49, works for Seattle and said employees receive ongoing diversity training that he believes has had a positive effect on his workplace, allowing people to advance their understanding of issues of race and equity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all on a different point in that spectrum,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, it provides everyone all these different opportunities to advance their awareness wherever they are on that spectrum.\u201d\n\nIn assessing their own workplaces, about 4 in 10 working adults say white people and men experience more advantages compared with others, while about half don\u2019t think they are more or less advantaged, according to the poll.\n\nRobin Knight, a 58-year-old dental technician from Brooklyn, said that when it comes to pay, men often have the advantage, even though she thinks in her female-dominated field, women often have an edge in getting hired.\n\n\u201cFor some reason, if a man is writing a check, he\u2019ll write more to his own counterpart than to us, and I don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said.\n\nThe poll also shows that people who supervise at least one employee are more likely than non-supervisors to say they\u2019ve talked with coworkers about sexual misconduct in the workplace in the last year, 41% to 23%, and that they\u2019ve changed how they interact with coworkers, 38% to 27%.\n\nTom Eisenhauer, 65, of Pocatello, Idaho, manages apartment complexes and oversees 25 to 30 people. His workers often must handle difficult situations with tenants, and he said women in the industry can face harassment and discrimination from tenants and coworkers. Hispanic workers are often pigeonholed by others, with people assuming they are janitors or pool cleaners.\n\n\u201cThey have to disprove the stereotype, even to somebody like me who\u2019s more liberal,\u201d said Eisenhauer, who is white.\n\nHe added: \u201cAll the horrible traps that we fall into, you know, we all do it. I\u2019m as guilty as anybody.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSmith reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n___\n\nThe AP-NORC Center survey of full- and part-time employees was conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research with funding from SAP. It was conducted July 25-30 using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points. Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods and later were interviewed online or by phone.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nAP-NORC Center: http://www.apnorc.org", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Barbara Myers started work as an apprentice electrician in 1995, and over the years she learned to shoot back sexual banter on the job", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/22/adbbd6_ap-poll-diversity-58526-ap-poll-diversity-results-ap-norc-poll-on-attitudes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
