Business Insider Intelligence\n\nAs 5G networks become a reality in 2019 and 2020, the new standard will further increase the appeal of cellular solutions in the areas where it's available. And, as 5G-supported hardware rolls out, companies can use the network to support their IoT business.\n\nBut the excitement around 5G doesn't mean it should be selected above all other options whenever available. In fact, in some cases, it's not even the best among cellular solutions. Companies that use IoT devices and providers of IoT-based services and solutions need to be discerning in their determinations of where 5G will help and where it won't.\n\nIn The 5G and The IoT Report, Business Insider Intelligence will examine how the introduction of 5G is poised to transform portions of the IoT ecosystem. First, we look at the 5G standard broadly, identifying its strengths and weaknesses in comparison with existing standards, as well as laying out the timeline for rollout and expectations within the wireless industry. Next, we look at the new practices that 5G will enable in the IoT, focusing specifically on the capacity for high-bandwidth remote analytics, as well as the ability to use remote processing centers for mission-critical services. Finally, we examine areas where 5G will leave gaps and how companies will need to cope with the standards' early limitations.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report are: AT&T, Ericsson, FairCom, InterDigital, Motorola, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Quectel, Sierra Wireless, Telstra, Verizon, and ZTE.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the report:\n\nWhere available, 5G will enable exciting new IoT use cases, like real-time remote analytics and the remote execution of mission-critical services.\n\nWhile 5G will offer a variety of useful new capabilities for companies that provide and use IoT solutions, there will be areas where it won't be useful within the IoT \u2014 at least not immediately.\n\nCompanies offering IoT solutions need to look at 5G as a tool in their arsenal; the thing they need to figure out is when they can build solutions that amplify its strengths, mitigate its weaknesses, and when turn to alternatives if they can't adequately do either.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nProvides an overview of the key differences between 5G networks and today's alternatives.\n\nHighlights the ways that 5G will enable new practices in the IoT.\n\nPresents some of the expectations for 5G from companies that will bring the standard to the world.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
