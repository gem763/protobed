From Allbirds releasing new styles to Rothy\u2019s creating merino wool versions of their classic flats and sneakers, everyone is getting a little wooly. But it\u2019s perfect timing, really. Sustainability is incredibly important right now and wool is one of the most sustainable materials out there. And as the weather starts to cool down and get a little damp, you\u2019ll want a material that has kept people warm for hundreds of years on your feet. Here are some of the top wool shoes you can get right now.\n\nMerino Chelsea, $175 at Rothy\u2019s: Rothy\u2019s makes classic, sustainable shoes made from recycled plastic bottles, but this new line is something a bit different. The Merino Collection puts a wool spin on classic styles throwing merino wool into the mix with the signature recycled thread. My favorite shape right now is the Chelsea, which is one part boot and one part sneaker. They\u2019re comfortable, breathable, and lightweight. Plus, they\u2019re machine-washable.\n\nWool Runner Mizzles, $115 at Allbirds: We\u2019ve raved about Allbirds for a while now. The Mizzle Runners are just about as good as it gets when it comes to sustainable wool sneakers. They\u2019re waterproof, breathable, and sturdy. They have the strength to keep you supported when you\u2019re on your feet all day yet feel like they\u2019re barely there. The durable, thick sole has added traction to get you over slippery sidewalks and train platforms.\n\nGlerups Slip On Rubber Slipper, $135 at Backcountry: Does it get any better than slipping into a pair of soft, warm slippers? Glerups slippers come in both a leather sole and a rubber sole, so you can keep one pair for in the house and one for out. For me, the Slip On Rubber Slipper is the golden ticket to a sustainable, comfortable slipper that you don\u2019t have to worry about leaving the house in. Run to the store, take the dog out, pick your kids up from school and don\u2019t worry if there\u2019s a little bit of snow on the ground because these will keep you warm, dry, and stable.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
