The client did not make the offer.\n\nSubsequently, he lied to his client that the seller had made a counteroffer of S$1.04 million. Ngu also lied to the seller's agent that his client had offered to buy the property for S$1.04 million and asked for a higher commission for himself.\n\nBoth the offer and counteroffer were made up by Ngu himself.\n\nThe seller's agent lowered the price tag to S$1.01 million and asked Ngu to get his commission from his client instead, but Ngu did not tell his client of the lower price.\n\nInstead, Ngu advised his client not to proceed with the property purchase because of the high price when the real reason was that he had failed to negotiate for a higher commission of 3 per cent of the sale price for himself, the CEA said.\n\nNgu's client only found out about his wrongful behaviour when he contacted the seller's agent directly to offer to buy the condo for S$1.04 million, which was accepted.\n\nThe CEA said that under its code of ethics, Ngu should have declared in writing to his client the conflict of interest in getting a commission from the seller.\n\nA higher price means a bigger commission for the buyer's agent, but this may be disadvantageous to the buyer.\n\nDuring the CEA disciplinary committee hearing, Ngu pleaded guilty to two charges of failing to convey offers from the seller to his client, and one charge of continuing to act on behalf of his client and failing to declare in writing his conflict of interest.\n\nAnother five charges, including conveying false offers, were taken into account for his punishment.\n\nHe was originally suspended for 14 months, which was lowered to 12 months after he appealed.\n\nThe CEA advised consumers to report agents whom they suspect to be unethical or unprofessional via feedback@cea.gov.sg or by calling 1800-643-2555.\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Real Estate - [SINGAPORE] A property agent has been fined S$30,000 and suspended for 12 months for faking offers and counteroffers in a private property transaction in a bid to get a bigger commission for himself at the expense of his client. .
