Anything to the contrary is entirely false and wildly inaccurate.'\n\nMultiple sources have told DailyMail.com that Smith was unhappy with how executives dealt with the situation, and felt that Carlson and the other primetime hosts were allowed to get away with this kind of behavior because they were pundits.\n\nHe on the other hand was told not to disparage Carlson and Laura Ingraham, because he was a news anchor.\n\nSmith is not the only person to have issues at Fox, with Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane also speaking out against the news network on multiple occasions.\n\nMacFarlane also took a role in the recent Showtime series The Loudest Voice in the Room, which took a look at sexual misconduct at Fox News while the network was under the control of Roger Ailes.\n\nWhen asked how 'awkward' it was to deal with those dissenting voices, Lachlan said: 'I don't think it's awkward at all, actually. We've never steered any creator to have a political bent or to influence what they put on our air.'\n\nAnd, as is the case in all Murdoch interviews these days, there was also the questions about a few current television and theatrical productions.\n\n'There's Succession, Ink on Broadway, then The Loudest Voice and Bombshell about Fox News,' pointed out the reporter interviewing Lachlan.\n\nThat's four separate projects this year that are either about your family business or a veiled story about your family. Why do you think people are so interested now?\n\n'Well, I'm not sure they're all about our family. But people are searching for good storylines,' said Lachlan.\n\n'I think a lot of these are more fictional than they are reality, but, you know, that's up to writers and producers to decide.'", "description": "Lachlan Murdoch is addressing the 'nasty' environment at Fox News in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.
