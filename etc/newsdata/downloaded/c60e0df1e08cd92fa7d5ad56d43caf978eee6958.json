I'd love Warren Gatland to have a shot at a World Cup final before he retires from the Wales job.\n\nI like the way his team play and in Jonathan Davies and Justin Tipuric they have two of my favourite current players.\n\nThey dodged a bullet in the quarter-finals - I still have no idea how they won that game - and I believe there will be a massive collective bounce against the Boks. Wales have proved time and time again that they can nick close matches.\n\nWarren Gatland (pictured) is attempting to guide Wales into a Rugby World Cup final in Japan\n\nIt's a brilliant habit to develop and it preys on the opposition minds, who get fretful if they don't put you away. As usual, the Boks will look to control proceedings up front, suffocate Wales and gradually accumulate a score like they did against Japan.\n\nWales must first resist and subdue that and then find a way of upsetting South Africa's rhythm, break the game up more than usual and bring their strike runners into play as much as possible.\n\nWe haven't seen George North nearly enough in this tournament and they must use the explosive Gareth Davies off the scrum and the back of lineouts.\n\nIt's a huge shame that Liam Williams is injured but that is offset by Cheslin Kolbe being ruled out for the Boks.\n\nAlthough South Africa also have some dangerous runners - Willie le Roux, Makazole Mapimpi and Sbu Nkosi - they always prefer a slightly slower tempo, power-orientated game. Wales need to make it much more staccato and frantic.\n\nI was having a catch-up with Gareth Thomas six weeks ago and we both agreed an England v Wales final was a real possibility and a life-changing match for all of us. It is more than on the cards.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: An exciting, close match is in store.
