After all, she\u2019d been on the contraceptive \u2018mini pill\u2019 since 2013 and had always been able to request a repeat prescription from the chemist. It was as routine. So, when her request was denied in August, she was left confused and anxious.\n\n\u2018The pharmacy I visited told me - in a vague way - that they didn\u2019t have my pill in stock and didn\u2019t know how long I\u2019d have to wait. They suggested I tried another pharmacy,\u2019 the 27-year-old tells ELLE UK.\n\nIrwin proceeded to go to her nearest Boots and was surprised to be met with the same response. \u2018The pharmacist behind the counter sighed and said they hadn\u2019t had my pill for months and that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get it,\u2019 she says. It was at that moment she slowly began to panic. Unbeknown to Irwin, this wasn\u2019t a localised situation.\n\nContraception shortages\n\nSince the summer, women in the UK have faced shortages of several oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) and self-injectables, including those of brand names Loestrin, Brevinor, Microgynon 30, Ovranette and Sayana Press. In May, pharmaceutical companies Bayer and Pfizer notified the Government that they would be out of stock for certain contraceptives, due to \u2018capacity constraints\u2019 at their manufacturing sites. It\u2019s worth noting that this happened after Bayer released a statement announcing that it would be stockpiling supplies in the UK for the periods immediately prior to and after the previous Brexit deadline date of 29th March 2019, according to the New Statesman.\n\nPhoto credit: Johanna Parkin - Getty Images More\n\nWhile shortages aren\u2019t exactly a new phenomenon - just this month the Government confirmed the latest restrictions on the exportation of all variations of Hormone Replacement Therapy products \u2013 they present a deeply worrying and complex issue for healthcare providers and the public. A lack of medication results in increased demand, endangering patients and pushing up the cost of health care.\n\nTo make matters worse, these shortages are happening amid the current political uncertainty facing the UK ahead of the possibility of a 'no-deal' Brexit. But is the prospect of an EU Exit really a cause for concern when it comes to women\u2019s health and contraception?\n\nIs Brexit to blame for the shortages?\n\nYou\u2019ll have read countless headlines about Brits stockpiling supermarket essentials, cancelling holidays and applying for Irish passports ahead of the Brexit deadline on October 31. So precarious is the future for the nation, notionally, that the public have begun doomsday prepping. And it's not just the general population.\n\nJust last year, Health Secretary Matt Hancock chartered an NHS aeroplane to ensure vital medical supplies were flown into the UK from Holland during a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, in August, the Royal College of Physicians and 16 other signatories sent an open letter, warning PMs of their concerns about medical supply shortages.\n\n\u2018Delays at our borders could exacerbate current supply issues and create the very real possibility that life-saving medication and devices are delayed from making it into the UK,\u2019 they wrote. Their unease was echoed again last month by a group of leading health think thanks from the likes of the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation.\n\nMore worryingly, this comes almost two years after members of the House of Commons Health Select Committee were told that medicines could become more difficult to import into the UK post-Brexit. In 2017, Martin Sawer, executive director of the Healthcare Distribution Association, told MPs that a whopping 90% of UK medicines are imported, and of that number almost half (45%) come from the EU. It\u2019s now estimated that 75% of all UK medicines come in via Channel crossings so any Customs delays post exit will, inevitably, cause problems.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is the possibility of an EU Exit a cause for concern?", "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mM6mnKi04Dth40r7WyvVVw--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/52292b286a322ddf4f011b327572c7b4", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
