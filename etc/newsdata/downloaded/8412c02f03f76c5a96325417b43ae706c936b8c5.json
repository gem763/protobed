Other areas that stand out include Washington D.C. where there are an estimated 99 homeless people per 10,000 in the city and in Honolulu, Hawaii, where there are an estimated 45 homeless people per 10,000 in the population.\n\nAndrew Coamey, the senior vice president of Housing Works, a New York-based charity with the mission of ending the dual crises of homelessness and HIV, said that the homelessness in \"pretty much every major city in the country [is] at epidemic proportions.\"\n\n\"Part of the issue is that we continue to have short-term solutions,\" Coamey said, echoing the other advocates in calling for permanent affordable housing as the ultimate answer to the larger issue and the violence seen this weekend.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think [supportive housing is] the answer to one individual's act of violence, but if those folks were not sleeping on the street they would not have been vulnerable to this kind of an attack,\" he said.\n\n\"[The attacker] didn't go into someone's house. He preyed on very vulnerable people who shouldn\u2019t be sleeping on the streets,\" Coamey said.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s office announced steps that will be taken in response to the attacks, including putting more counselors and mental health outreach teams on the ground, both in the Chinatown area where the attacks took place and in community locations throughout the city.\n\nDuggan said in the wake of Saturday\u2019s slayings, among the Partnership for the Homeless\u2019 clients, \"There is definitely a sense of heightened fear and also just a lot of silence. People are really lost for words, like how do you respond to something so awful and so tragic?\"\n\nShe said there\u2019s at least one other step that can be taken to help with the mourning, and that is for the identities of the victims to be released as soon as possible.\n\n\"All New Yorkers care when any of us get hurt in senseless ways ... but these New Yorkers are invisible until we know their names,\" Duggan said.", "description": "Three advocates who work for different non-profits dedicated to tackling homelessness in New York said there is no mystery in solving the issue.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/chinatown-homeless-ap-jt-191007_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
