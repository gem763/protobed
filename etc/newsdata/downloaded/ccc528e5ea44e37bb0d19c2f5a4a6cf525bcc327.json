The alternative is Plan B. When you organise a World Cup you should have one in place.\"\n\nParisse even suggested there was an element of disrespect in the decision, even though Italy have lost every one of their previous 15 Tests against New Zealand.\n\n\"Sure, everyone might think that Italy versus New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we'd have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team,\" he added.\n\n\"If Italy and New Zealand decide they don't want to play, then fine. But as I said before, if New Zealand needed the points it wouldn't have been cancelled.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Italy coach Conor O'Shea lamented a \"horrible\" finish to the World Cup.\n\n\"I saw the players' reaction after training and it was horrible because these guys have given their lives to Italian rugby and their World Cup has ended on the training pitch, when it should be on the playing field,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel bad for Sergio and the whole squad.\"\n\nBut All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said cancellation was a \"no-brainer\", insisting when you \"get a typhoon to the level we're getting then safety is the paramount thing\".", "description": "Italy captain Sergio Parisse has slammed the decision to cancel his side's Rugby World Cup match against New Zealand because of Super Typhoon Hagibis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7118/2bb423e2ffec4f5f917592dfd2703eb1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
