It all makes me think of a Hangtown Fry, my favorite dish at the Tadich Grill in San Francisco. During the Gold Rush, a prisoner condemned to death could request a final meal. To delay the hangman, a smart prisoner would order an omelet with bacon and oysters, meaning someone had to head down to the coast for ingredients, which could take weeks or months. Delicious, by the way.\n\nAny action to break up Google, Facebook and others is, like that Hangtown Fry, going to take a very long time to happen, if it happens at all. The first antitrust suit against IBM was filed in 1968. The U.S. government dismissed all antitrust cases against IBM as \u201cwithout merit\u201d in 1982. AT&T , an actual government-mandated monopoly, faced its first antitrust suit in 1974. It settled through a consent decree in 1982, with the Bell telephone system breaking into Baby Bells. Yet unlike Humpty Dumpty, the market put AT&T mostly back together again, with it and Verizon going strong in wireless\u2014a field few foresaw at the time of the breakup.\n\nAfter all the saber-rattling and congressional hearings, to succeed in court antitrust advocates will have to demonstrate that tech companies\u2019 actions are harming consumers. Yes, the FTC recently penalized Facebook for privacy violations, but its antitrust investigation is aimed at countering potentially anticompetitive practices, an entirely different matter. The rather weak case from the director of the FTC\u2019s competition bureau is that Facebook bought startups \u201cthat might ultimately unseat them,\u201d which the director says may violate the commission\u2019s \u201ctheory of competitive harm.\u201d Theory indeed.\n\nThe Justice Department is more gung-ho. Its antitrust enforcer Makan Delrahim declared, \u201cWithout the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\u201d Note that Mr. Delrahim uses the weasel word \u201cmay\u201d\u2014which is to say the tech companies may ignore consumer demands, but then again they may not. Mr. Delrahim is hinting at regulators\u2019 dream: forward-looking antitrust analysis.\n\nMr. Delrahim and the crystal-ball gazers at Justice and the FTC think they have a perfect view of the future, so they want to break up companies before they commit any offense. They\u2019re channeling Tom Cruise in \u201cMinority Report,\u201d in which cops use a psychic technology to catch murderers before they commit crimes.\n\nUnfortunately for the Justice Department, current antitrust law is based on evidence of actual consumer harm and not mere speculation about what could happen in the future. A sharp legal mind tells me, \u201cThe key is the degree of certainty with which the government can prove the future harm is likely to happen.\u201d Justice can pull a minority report on companies contemplating mergers\u2014note how T-Mobile and Sprint had to give up business to get their deal done\u2014but not antitrust.\n\nSo has Big Tech squashed competition? Hmmm, let\u2019s see. From 2014-18, global venture-capital funding has tripled to almost $360 billion. More than 40,000 startups launched in 2018. There are almost 12 million technology jobs in the U.S. while Apple , Amazon, Google and Facebook combined employ fewer than a million, world-wide.\n\nSo here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Big Tech is going to order the omelet\u2014slow things down, obfuscate, hire lobbyists and hope like hell they can come up with new business models and move on from most of their current business in case the regulators in Washington speed things up.\n\nInstead of spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp, as Facebook critics including founder Chris Hughes seem to demand, the social-media giant is trying to become the ultimate service for private communications and payments. It won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s certainly worth a try.\n\nGoogle should stop running its own ads ahead of its customers\u2019; that\u2019s just dumb. But they should also stop running ads on YouTube and instead turn it into a legitimate cord-cutting Netflix-competing streaming service with a monthly fee. Apple should also stop favoring its own apps over companies in its ecosystem\u2014again, just dumb. And Amazon should probably sell Whole Foods to Safeway and declare victory. Don\u2019t be surprised if, on its own, it spins off its web-hosting business someday.\n\nTechnology\u2019s relentless advance means markets sort things out over time. Note the irony of Amazon creating New York office space in the building abandoned by former retail powerhouse Lord & Taylor. And though IBM never did get broken up, it ended 2017 with its 22nd consecutive down quarter. It downsized all by itself.\n\nOr this: On the back of the tourist-mecca thumbs-up sign at the entrance to Facebook headquarters is the old sign for Sun Microsystems, the complex\u2019s original tenant bought by Oracle in 2010. The story goes that Mark Zuckerberg wants Facebook employees to see Sun Microsystem\u2019s sign as they leave work every day as a reminder that success is fleeting. Breaking up is hard to do, and that Hangtown Fry omelet is slow to assemble.", "description": "Facebook, Google and the rest will change their ways before the feds can make a case.", "authors": ["Andy Kessler"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107103/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
