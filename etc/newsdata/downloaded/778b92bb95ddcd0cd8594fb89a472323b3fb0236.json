It\u2019s an expansion that foregrounds much of the maths that Destiny has spent the last few years hiding, giving players more control over how they tweak and build their Guardians to play the way they want them to play. I enjoy this, but I\u2019ve also quickly grown wary of it.\n\nThe expansion and the game-wide update that came with it added more stats, challenging players to manage armour affinities, mods and their corresponding energy costs. This is in addition to the Power stat armour has always come with, which contributes to an overall Power score that dictates the kind of content your Guardian can take on. Achieve 900 Power (from the starting score of 750) and then any old piece of armour will no longer do \u2014 you\u2019ll want \u201cPowerful\u201d armour, awarded via specific set of activities. Powerful rewards inch you up towards the game\u2019s hard cap of 960 Power.\n\nWith this more stat-oriented, hardcore role-playing game approach,Shadowkeep makes Destiny more of a hobbyist game. On last week\u2019s Splitscreen podcast, I compared it to someone having a hot rod \u2014 something you never really finish, but get joy out of tinkering with forever and continually taking out for a spin.\n\nYou have your Guardian, and your preferred set of abilities, and you go out on the hunt for better and better weapons and armour that work in tandem to help you get the best performance out of that Guardian. It\u2019s satisfying, but it also requires a lot of time and attention.\n\nIt also makes it harder to step away from Destiny. Unlike other expansions, Shadowkeep does not come with a wealth of content suited for dipping into in a more relaxed fashion. There\u2019s not much of a story campaign, no show-stopping new game mode that introduces a new wrinkle to the shooting and looting.\n\nYou can see most of what\u2019s new in a couple of hours, and after that, you\u2019ll hit the soft Power cap of 900, and the primary draw is in finding incrementally better \u201cPowerful\u201d gear from a narrow selection of activities \u2014 gear that, thanks to the newly stat-heavy bent to the game, now comes with a wider selection of randomised stats than ever before. You could spend a very long time looking for the perfect pair of boots, or getting the amount of materials required to fully maximise their potential.\n\nShadowkeep also leans heavily into a quest design that emphasises habitual play. For example, to get Deathbringer, a new exotic rocket launcher, you need to take on a bunch of challenges that are already in the game, making sure you stop to do a few things differently. First, you clear the moon\u2019s three Lost Sectors per the Lunar Spelunker bounty that the area\u2019s quest giver Eris Morn offers every week, which opens up a fourth. In that fourth Lost Sector, you have to keep an eye out for a special room where you can use a special key. Finding that room will get you an incomplete necklace, which you have to finish by killing enemies with arc abilities. (Why? Who can say.)\n\nDoing that will give you another set of objectives, each of them achievable by doing another run-of-the-mill activity \u2014 like the Scarlet Keep strike mission \u2014 while keeping an eye out for something just a little different. It\u2019s tedious on paper, but immersed in Destiny\u2019s moment-to-moment grind, it\u2019s satisfying to have a list of boxes to check as you progress to a reward you\u2019ll probably get a kick out of using.\n\nThat\u2019s how it feels until you spend some time away. I\u2019m in the early stages of wedding planning and on a mad dash to find a venue \u2014 so over the last couple of days, I haven\u2019t really played many video games at all, let alone Destiny. And over those few days, the pull back to the my hot rod Guardian has diminished by a startling amount. It\u2019s easy, desirable even, to just\u2026 unplug from the game, and play something that offers the same shoot-and-loot experience, but without the level of attentiveness that building a character entails in Destiny.\n\nIt\u2019s a satisfying hobby, in the old-school sense where hobbies are laborious, meditative activities. The joy of a hobby comes from the ritual, the familiar sense of flow and progress towards your own goals that you can slip into each evening you\u2019re able to get away and enjoy it. Break that ritual, and that sense of flow and satisfaction can be harder to get into. Then your hobby feels less like a pleasure, and more like a job.", "description": "Destiny 2: Shadowkeep is made with the dedicated Destiny player in mind.
