I have seen time and time again over my lifetime examples of small, often seemingly insignificant steps, adding up over time to make a huge impact. This is why I\u2019m an advocate of making at least a small amount of progress on your goals each day \u2014 because they add up over time.\n\nThis column will focus on how something that seems like a trivial amount \u2014 a small 1% gain \u2014 can make a huge difference in your earning, saving, and investing.\n\nThe impact of 1% in your career\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt about it: managing a career for maximum growth can have a huge financial payoff. In fact, the difference between someone working their career and a person who doesn\u2019t can be millions of dollars.\n\nThe key to extra millions lies in getting higher than average salary increases. Some people complain that 4%, 5%, or 6% average annual income gains are unrealistic, so let\u2019s just look at the power of 1% more.\n\nBut before we do that, I want to get a commitment from those who doubt. Do you think a person could squeak out just a 1% gain in raises over a career (assuming you would get 3% on average and now move to 4%) by taking the few, simple steps required to make the most of your career?\n\nIn other words, let\u2019s say Jim is an average employee and he gets average raises of 3% a year. Sue puts in time and effort at managing her career \u2014 exceeding expectations, being likable, networking, proactively managing her career (including asking for raises, moving jobs when needed, etc.), and the like.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s reasonable for Sue to average 4% raises a year? It seems like a no-brainer to me. In fact, her gains will probably be much higher. But today we\u2019re just looking at that extra 1%. And given the effort she\u2019s putting in it, it seems likely she could make it. What does that 1% do for Sue? Assuming she and Jim both start work at 22, they both work until 65, and they both start at annual salaries of $35,000 a year, here are their results if Jim averages 3% raises and Sue averages 4%:\n\n\u2022 Jim ends up making $121k at 65 and makes $3.0 million over the course of his career.\n\n\u2022 Sue ends up making $182k at 65 and makes $3.9 million over the course of her career.\n\nIn this case, the value of just that extra 1% is $900,000. Almost a million dollars.\n\nSue ends up making 30% more than Jim simply by averaging an extra 1% raise over the course of her career. And this seems entirely reasonable to do this, right? Of course, we\u2019ve already agreed to that.\n\nHow do you get this extra 1%? It\u2019s not that difficult. Follow my career improvement suggestions. These should most certainly get you an extra 1% a year \u2014 and will likely result in more.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that even though their salaries grew at different rates, both Sue and Jim each earned millions of dollars over their working careers. In other words, almost any career is worth millions of dollars. That\u2019s why it is your most valuable financial asset. What else do you own that\u2019s worth a few million? Another reason to take care of your career\u2026but I digress.\n\nThe impact of 1% in your savings\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the power of saving an extra 1%.\n\nLet\u2019s say Sue wasn\u2019t the career champion noted above, but more of a saving expert. Here are the financial stats we\u2019ll begin with:\n\n\u2022 22 years old\n\n\u2022 Earns starting salary of $35,000 a year\n\n\u2022 Gets average annual pay increases of 3%\n\n\u2022 Starts out saving 10% of income\n\n\u2022 Savings earns 7% a year\n\nFrom here, let\u2019s look at a couple different scenarios.\n\nIn the first one, Sue saves 10% a year throughout her working career. Nothing more, nothing less. Under the above assumptions, she retires at 65 with a nest egg of $1.3 million. Not bad. But it could be more.\n\nLet\u2019s bump that savings rate by 1% and see what happens.\n\nIf Sue saves 11% a year, she retires with almost $1.4 million, $100,000 more for only a fraction more saved. It\u2019s not life-changing, but why not pocket an extra $100,000 for doing basically nothing? And if an extra $100,000 isn\u2019t worth the effort for you, stay tuned. I have some ideas below to really make your finances sing.\n\nHow do you get this extra 1%? I\u2019d suggest you focus on the best ways to save money. Certainly these can help you save at least 1% extra, probably more.\n\nThe impact of 1% in your investments\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the impact of 1% on investments. We\u2019ll take the same starting scenario as above with Sue\u2019s finances (saving 10%). But this time, instead of earning 7% on her money, she earns 8%.\n\nHere are the results:\n\n\u2022 Investing 10% for 43 years at 7% yields $1.3 million.\n\n\u2022 Investing 10% for 43 years at 8% yields $1.7 million.\n\nNot bad, right? An extra $400k for an extra 1%. How do you get this extra 1%?\n\nWhen comes to investing it\u2019s more about not shooting yourself in the foot. I\u2019d personally suggest:\n\nNot buying individual stocks. You are not smarter than fund managers who have the time, talent, and resources to make great picks \u2014 and even they can\u2019t earn more consistently. This is why most millionaires don\u2019t focus their investing on individual stocks \u2014 they have tried them and in the vast majority of cases it turns out to be an investing mistake.\n\nAvoid market timing. Studies show that most people are their own worst enemies when trying to time the market. They inevitably sell at the bottom of a market and buy at the top. It\u2019s better to be in for the long term, taking the punches of the drops but also enjoying the times the market flies high.\n\n\u2022 Cut expenses. Investing expenses \u2014 and there are a host of them \u2014 can kill any gains you might get. We\u2019re talking about the power of 1% extra in this post, but when it comes to investing an extra 1% in costs can kill your returns over time.\n\nThese issues are some of the reasons I invest with index funds. They address all these issues and many more. If you want more specifics and a deeper review of index fund investing, check out \u201cThe Simple Path to Wealth\u201d and \u201cThe Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Investing,\u201d two of the best investing books out there.\n\nMaking the most of an extra 1%\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve looked at an extra 1% from an earning, savings, and investing standpoint \u2014 and seen the impact of each individually. And the results have been pretty impressive for such a small set of incremental changes. That said, Sue has not made the most of her financial gains in a couple ways.\n\nFirst, she hasn\u2019t combined their impacts. She\u2019s only done one at a time in our examples. Second, she hasn\u2019t pushed the power of 1% as much as she could in savings, where doing so could make a massive difference. (And let\u2019s face it, with all the extra money she\u2019s making at work, she can certainly afford to save more.)\n\nLet\u2019s look at the power of 1% turned up a notch and see what would the results be. As you might imagine, the three factors work together in concert as follows:\n\n\u2022 The more Sue earns in her career, the more she can save.\n\n\u2022 The more Sue saves, the more she has to compound over time.\n\n\u2022 The more Sue earns on her investments, the faster compounding works.\n\nAgain, here\u2019s the original scenario:\n\n\u2022 22 years old\n\n\u2022 Earns starting salary of $35,000 a year\n\n\u2022 Gets average annual pay increases of 3%\n\n\u2022 Starts out saving 10% of income\n\n\u2022 Savings earns 7% a year\n\nAs a reminder, these stats gave her $1.3 million saved at the end of 43 years. Now here\u2019s a ramped-up version of the above:\n\n\u2022 22 years old\n\n\u2022 Earns starting salary of $35,000 a year\n\n\u2022 Gets average annual pay increases of 4%\n\n\u2022 Starts out saving 11% of income and adds 1% a year to this amount (12% in year 2, 13% in year 3, etc.) until it peaks out at 40%\n\n\u2022 Savings earns 8% a year\n\nDoing this she ends up with $4.9 million saved at the end of 43 years. Kind of magical, right? She\u2019s not only making more, but as she does, she\u2019s saving an increasing percentage of the pie. All this from a $35,000 starting salary, growing her income, increasing her savings rate annually, and time. It\u2019s the power of 1% in all areas of her financial life and it makes a huge difference in her net worth.\n\nDoing even more\n\nThe amazing thing is that these results are just the tip of the financial iceberg. With a bit more pushing, Sue could make the numbers really silly. How could she improve upon these?\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n\u2022 Start at a higher salary. Negotiating the starting salary of your first job can make hundreds of thousands of dollars difference.\n\n\u2022 Get higher raises. Some people may think that 5%+ average raises are things of the past, but I don\u2019t. There will always be more than enough compensation growth for good employees. These workers manage their careers intentionally, delivering above average value. This value then gets rewarded in extra pay. This is exactly what millionaires do to grow their incomes at higher rates.\n\n\u2022 Create a side hustle. A career isn\u2019t the only way to add extra income \u2014 a side hustle is an awesome way to make more money. It\u2019s so powerful that it can get you to financial independence within 10 years.\n\n\u2022 Start with a higher savings rate. Nothing says that 11% is the peak starting point for savings. You can begin with a much higher rate from the get-go.\n\n\u2022 Get matches. If Sue has a 401(k) company match, that would add to these numbers.\n\n\u2022 Keep saving past 40%. Many early retirees save much more than 40% of their income. Sue could do the same.\n\n\u2022 Higher returns. This is possible, so I\u2019ll include it, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s not probable. Some would say the market has returned 10% over the long-term and Dave Ramsey would say 12%, but I feel comfortable with 8%. That said, if she did earn more than 8%, the results would be better.\n\nFor kicks, let\u2019s run a scenario to show how crazy things can get. Let\u2019s assume the following:\n\n\u2022 Sue\u2019s age \u2014 22 years old\n\n\u2022 Starts out earning $40,000 a year. She negotiates well from day one and begins higher than she would have without doing it.\n\n\u2022 Gets average annual pay increases of 5%. She asks for raises, changes companies, gets promoted, and negotiates more along the way.\n\n\u2022 Starts out saving 20% of income and adds 1% a year to this amount (21% in year 2, 22% in year 3, etc.) until it peaks out at 60%.\n\n\u2022 Gets a company match of 4.5% of her salary (a bit below the national average of 4.7%).\n\n\u2022 Adds in a side hustle in year five that earns $10k a year (which she also invests).\n\n\u2022 Savings earns 8% a year.\n\nAny guesses at how much she ends up with at 65?\n\nAlmost $13 million. It doesn\u2019t even represent the top of what can happen (there is still room for improvement). But the numbers are so over the top that pushing them more almost transports us to the Twilight Zone. In the end, this is a powerful demonstration of what can be accomplished financially with simple but powerful moves over time.\n\nBy the way, she hits the following milestones:\n\n\u2022 $1 million in 19 years\n\n\u2022 $2 million in 25 years\n\n\u2022 $3 million in 29 years\n\n\u2022 $4 million in 31 years\n\n\u2022 $5 million in 34 years (rounding carries this to three years instead of two)\n\n\u2022 $6 million in 35 years\n\nSo she\u2019s financially independent well before 65.\n\nDon\u2019t fret if you\u2019re older\n\nYou may be 20 years into a career and think this advice is not for you \u2014 that it only holds true for those at the beginning of their careers. I have a couple thoughts for you:\n\n\u2022 If you start taking the steps above now, no matter where you are in your finances, you will ultimately be better off than you would be without doing anything.\n\n\u2022 Sure, an extra 1% over 40 years is better than an extra 1% over 20 years. But an extra 1% over 20 years is better than nothing extra over 20 years.\n\nEven if you\u2019re older and have messed up your finances so far, there\u2019s still hope for you. You don\u2019t need 40+ years to become wealthy. If you really set your mind to it and apply the principles above, you can have substantial wealth in 20 years \u2014 or even 15. So don\u2019t say \u201cit\u2019s too late for me\u201d if you\u2019re 40 or 45 or even 50.\n\nAnd for those of you older than 50 and in financial trouble, if you put the above principles into action now, you\u2019ll be much better off at retirement than you would be if you keep on doing what you\u2019ve been doing up to this point.\n\nThis column originally appeared on ESI Money.
