'Preying on minors and hooking them on a potentially lethal, lifelong nicotine addiction is unconscionable.'\n\nArtisan Vapor Franchise, Eliquidstop.com and Vapor 4 Life could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThere has been a regulatory crackdown on e-cigarettes and a growing number of lawsuits by young adults and parents of teenagers against leading e-cigarette company Juul Labs Inc and its parent company, Marlboro maker Altria Group.\n\nMost of the lawsuits say only that users became addicted to nicotine as a result of using Juul, but some allege serious health consequences.\n\nSome states, including New York, Michigan and Rhode Island, have moved to restrict the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. Massachusetts has gone further, instituting a four-month ban on all vaping products.\n\nLast week, a New York judge blocked a state ban on most flavored e-cigarettes from taking effect after an industry group sued to challenge it, while a Massachusetts judge upheld that state's ban.\n\nOn Thursday, Washington's ban on flavored e-cigarettes - including those containing THC - officially took effect after being passed by the state's board of health as an emergency measure.\n\nSan Francisco was the first city to ban vaping. Juul, which has cornered 70 percent of the e-cigarette market and has been hit with criticism for targeting youth, is headquartered there.\n\nIt had been the driving force - not to mention funder - behind a ballot measure to overturn the ban, but with a new CEO at its helm, Juul dropped its support and millions of dollars from the bill.\n\nLos Angeles is now considering a similar ban.", "description": "One day after reporting its first fatality, New York City has filed a lawsuit against 22 online companies that it claims didn't verify ages.
