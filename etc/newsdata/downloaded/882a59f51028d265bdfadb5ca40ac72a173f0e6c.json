The flexibility of this style will help keep you from breaking the cork. And it\u2019s not an expensive tool, either \u2013 you can generally find them for under \u00a310 in a supermarket, cookery or wine shop.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nConsider decanting your wine: Traditionally used to separate sediment off the wine in older red bottles, decanting has become more fashionable and common across the board these days. The real benefit of the process is that it gently exposes the wine to air, softening its acids and tannin, effectively smoothing out all the sharp edges and wrinkles. It can be particularly helpful in taming the funk that comes off so-called reductive wines.\n\nSmell your glasses before you use them: As important as it\u2019s to make sure your dishware and cutlery are clean before you use them, so it goes with your glassware. One of the best, mostenjoyable parts about drinking wine is appreciating its fragrance.\n\nIt\u2019s best that there\u2019s no residual soap smell or dusty cupboard taint getting in the way.\n\nDON\u2019T\n\nServe your white wines too cold: Why? Because you\u2019ll taste less. Light-bodied, less-aromatic wines should be served colder, in the 4\u20138C range, whereas more expressive and fuller-bodied whites should ideally be served in the slightly-warmer-but-still technically cold range of 8\u201310C.\n\nServe your red wines too warm: Heat will exacerbate the alcohol content of a wine, making your nose hairs burn when you go in for a big whiff. Conventional wisdom generally dictates that light-to medium bodied reds should be served around 13\u201315C, while fuller-bodied reds are better enjoyed in the 15\u201320C range.\n\nSmell the cork to verify that your wine isn\u2019t corked: Instead, smell the wine itself! Taking a quick whiff over the bottle opening will suffice. If it doesn\u2019t smell like damp cardboard or wet dog, you\u2019re good. Because, at the end of the day, even a cork that isn\u2019t tainted still smells like cork, so really how helpful is it to smell it?\n\nTake your thumb off the cork and cage when you\u2019re opening sparkling wine: Opening a bottle of bubbly should look something like this: cut and remove the top of the foil. Put your thumb over the cage, twist open the cage tab (without taking it off), angle the bottle and rotate the base with one hand as the other wriggles the cork in the opposite direction, slowly pulling up. Keeping your hand on the cork until it\u2019s off is the best insurance policy against it violently popping off in potentially dangerous directions.\n\nOverpour your glass: Seriously, no matter how rough the day. If the glass is too full and you try to do your best professional swirl-and-sniff, chances are you\u2019re going to end up making a mess.\n\nLet past-its-prime, open wine go to waste: See if you can\u2019t find a recipe for a stew, or soup or sauce where it can be given a respectable second-chance at life.\n\n'Grasping the Grape' by Maryse Chevriere (Hardie Grant, \u00a310) is out now", "description": "DO Chill light-bodied, low-tannin, aromatic red wines: Aim for somewhere in the 10\u201313C\u00a0range; it will make the wine taste more refreshing and help highlight fruit flavours and the brightness of a wine\u2019s acidity.", "authors": ["Maryse Chevriere"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/12/wine-etiquette.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
