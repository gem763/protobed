Smoking gave people a reason to talk to me. But earlier this year, I took a chance on a tube of Sephora Collection\u2019s Long-Lasting 12 HR Wear Eye Liner in Fancy Blue, and it\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve come to getting all my strangers back.\n\nI can\u2019t take credit for the idea. Sometime in late spring this year, someone I follow on Twitter (I\u2019m absolutely tortured that I can\u2019t remember who) tweeted a photo of herself wearing bright-blue eyeliner, and I, in my navy-blue eyeliner, wasted no time running to Sephora in the middle of the workday to copy her.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem with eyeliner: It\u2019s easy to convince yourself that more money buys you a higher-quality product, but all it really does is buy you better packaging and better marketing. At $12, Sephora Collection\u2019s liquid eyeliner lasts about the same amount of time as a former favorite eyeliner of mine but at half the price. If I apply it at 8:30 a.m., I can go until about 6 p.m. without having to fix or reapply it (which is a true miracle given how determined my eyelids are to shed whatever\u2019s on them).\n\nEver since I started wearing Fancy Blue, I get compliments every single day, sometimes in multiples. I have conversations with strangers about our greasy eyelids, the colors we\u2019re working up the courage to try, the products we think are scams \u2014 I haven\u2019t spoken to this many strangers per day since I was a smoker, and I love it. It\u2019s that small, seemingly insignificant bit of access to other people that\u2019s easy to take for granted, a certain strain of \u201chow about the weather\u201d type of conversation I thought I\u2019d never get back.\n\nPhoto: Sephora SEPHORA COLLECTION Long-Lasting 12 HR Wear Eye Liner $12 at Sephora Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "A review of Sephora Collection Long-Lasting 12 Hr Wear Eye Liner, in the shade Royal Blue, a liquid eyeliner that lives up.", "authors": ["Aude White"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/18/18-sephora-eyeliner-feed.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
