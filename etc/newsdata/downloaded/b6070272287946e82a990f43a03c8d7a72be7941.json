It also signifies a major legal triumph for a coalition of advocacy groups and Democratic-led states, counties and cities that challenged the rule through nearly a dozen lawsuits in federal courts across the country.\n\nDaniels faulted the government for not adequately explaining why it was changing the definition of a \"public charge\" or why the change was needed. \"The Rule is simply a new agency policy of exclusion in search of a justification,\" he wrote in his ruling. \"It is repugnant to the American dream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work and upwards mobility.\"\n\nIn a separate, more limited ruling later on Friday, a district court judge in San Francisco said the administration could not enforce the rule in certain jurisdictions where plaintiffs filed lawsuits.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Xavier Becerra, left, announced in August that California had joined a lawsuit against the \"public charge\" regulation rolled out by the Trump administration.

The term was first codified in U.S. law in 1882, the same year the U.S. enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred the entry of Chinese laborers on the premise that they jeopardized \"the good order of certain localities.\"\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Clinton administration issued guidance saying only cash benefits could be considered when determining whether an immigrant could be a \"public charge.\" The Trump administration's proposal, however, would substantially expand this centuries-old term by broadening the type and amount of benefits that count against immigrants seeking to stay or move to the U.S.\n\nUnder the new regulation, caseworkers would consider enrollment in the widely used Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), certain federally funded Medicaid benefits and a variety of forms of government-subsidized housing, including the popular Section 8 vouchers. Officials would deem an immigrant a \"public charge\" and deny the application if they determine he or she is more likely than not to use one of the considered benefits for 12 months or longer over the span of three years.\n\nCaseworkers would also take into account the petitioner's age, educational skills, English language proficiency and health to determine whether they are likely to rely on the government for support. On certain occasions, those deemed a \"public charge\" could post a bond for an amount no less than $8,100.\n\nThe rule would not affect asylum seekers, refugees or holders of special visas for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who helped U.S. forces in those countries.\n\nImmigrants await their turn for green card and citizenship interviews in Queens, New York.

When a draft of the rule was published late last year for a 60-day period of public review, it received more than 260,000 comments, most of them from individuals, organizations and jurisdictions opposed to the regulation.\n\nCritics have said the rule will disproportionately affect low-income immigrants of color and punish them for being poor.\n\nEven though the rule has not been implemented yet, researchers have already detailed a \"chilling effect\" among immigration communities, including in mixed-status households where some family members are undocumented immigrants, while other are permanent residents and U.S. citizens.\n\nAccording to one study, talk of the rule, along with confusion over which benefits will be consider, has prompted some immigrant families \u2014 including U.S. citizens \u2014 to avoid or drop food, medical and housing government benefits out of fear that enrollment would jeopardize immigration petitions filed by family members.\n\nAdministration officials and immigration hardliners have strongly defended the rule, arguing that it will foster \"self-sufficiency\" among immigrant communities. Acting USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli, who unveiled the final rule in August, even offered an alternative line to \"The New Colossus\" poem inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty to advocate for the regulation.\n\n\"Give me your tired your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge,\" he told NPR in August. The original sonnet reads, \"Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\n\nActing Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli, speaks during a briefing at the White House, Monday, Aug. 12, 2019, in Washington. Evan Vucci / AP\n\nThe State Department last year expanded \"public charge\" considerations used by consular officers to grant or reject visa applications. The White House budget office is also currently reviewing a proposed Justice Department regulation that would allow the U.S. to deport immigrants deemed a \"public charge\" under the new guidelines of the USCIS rule that was blocked on Friday.\n\nEarlier in the month, the administration announced that it is preparing to reject visa applications from immigrants the government determines will not be able to pay for health insurance or cover health care costs in the U.S. The new requirement is set to go into effect November 3.", "description": "The rule, slated to go into effect on Tuesday, would've made it easier for the government to reject green card and temporary visa applications from low-income immigrants", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/08/c4e153a4-cddb-4b71-b9dc-e63bce6255ad/thumbnail/1200x630/6b5076d0918c8e8752613fc042367a4d/gettyimages-169664465.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
