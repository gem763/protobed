The pair will be grilled on their management of Thomas Cook, accounting practices, executive pay, and the high levels of debt taken on by the company that ultimately led to its demise.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s former chief financial officer, the chair of its audit committee, and chair of its remuneration committee will all also face the committee next Tuesday.\n\nThe BEIS inquiry is one of several high-profile investigations into the collapse of Thomas Cook, which went bust last month. The collapse of the 178-year-old travel operator left 150,000 customers stranded overseas and put about 9,000 staff out of work, although some jobs have since been salvaged. The government has been left to pick up the pieces, with some estimates putting the cost at over half a billion pounds.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s management have been heavily criticised in the wake of the travel operator\u2019s collapse after it emerged that executives were paid \u00a320m in pay and bonuses in the five years before the business collapsed. Transport secretary Grant Shapps has suggested directors could have their bonuses clawed back or be disqualified from future roles.\n\nLabour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the BEIS committee, said when the inquiry was first announced: \u201cAmid the frustration of holidaymakers and the misery of thousands of staff losing their jobs, the collapse of Thomas Cook has uncovered what appears to be a sorry tale of corporate greed.\u201d\n\nShe said there were \u201cserious questions about the actions of Thomas Cook\u2019s bosses and their stewardship of the business.\u201d\n\nThe BEIS committee said on Thursday that Thomas Cook\u2019s auditors PwC and EY will also appear before the committee to answer questions on 22 October. Thomas Cook\u2019s excessive use of \u201cexceptional costs\u201d to massage its profit numbers has also been criticised in recent weeks and former auditors EY is facing a separate investigation led by the Financial Reporting Council.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing is set to begin at 9am in parliament.", "description": "Former CEO Peter Fankhauser and chairman Peter Meysman will face the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee next Tuesday.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/adon1TBf6WNrYZutM4PPnQ--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f24193e0-ddd4-11e9-abff-3ff6d01e7626", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
