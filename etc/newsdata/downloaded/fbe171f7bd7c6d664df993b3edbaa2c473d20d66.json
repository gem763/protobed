Saying no to someone else can be a way to say yes to yourself \u2014 and it is one of the most important tools for holiday mental health.\n\nSo, what are some specific tips for letting go of things that might not benefit you this holiday season? We asked 5 experts, and this is what they said.\n\n1. Say no to cooking\n\n\u201cI say no to pretending to be Martha Stewart,\u201d says Megan McDonough, founder of the Wholebeing Institute. \u201cI don\u2019t like to cook, and I do not want to spend my holiday cooking. I say yes to having everyone over to my house to celebrate. My husband cooks the turkey and everyone brings a side.\u201d\n\nMcDonough says instead of cooking the perfect Thanksgiving meal or setting the perfect table, she focuses on saying yes to what she loves \u2014 good conversation with the family and singing holiday songs with anyone who will join her.\n\n2. Say no to old traditions\n\n\u201cPeople often have an idea of how the holidays should be and [they] go to great lengths to recreate what they experienced, or didn\u2019t experience, in their childhood,\u201d says Dr. Alexandra Stockwell, MD. \u201cThis is a set-up for disappointment \u2014 as the reality is often less idyllic than imagined.\u201d\n\nIt's OK to let celebrations and traditions naturally evolve as life and family dynamics do. A great example of this that many people face is divorce. The first few years of change can be disappointing and downright upsetting. Seeing an empty chair at the dining room table or beloved family traditions fall by the wayside can be hard to accept.\n\nMore: 10 New Thanksgiving traditions to try with your family this year\n\nTry thinking about the holidays in a new way, and mindfully say yes to the family in front of you.

Focus on creating new memories, while still honoring and remembering the old ones.\n\n3. Say no to feeling depleted\n\n\u201cBetween buying gifts, shopping, cooking and cleaning, the months between Thanksgiving and the New Year leave many well-intentioned people depleted,\u201d says Dr. Paul Hokemeyer, a psychotherapist at Urban Recovery. He says limiting the number of things you do can help you be intentional, rather than reactive.\n\nUrban Recovery\u2019s Dr. Lipi Royadds that you should only agree to what you have the mental and physical capacity for.\n\n\u201cIf you're getting overwhelmed, slow down, politely decline and remind your loved one that \u2018no\u2019 can simply mean \u2018not now,\u2019\u201d says Roy. \u201cIf you're going through a lot, share that with family and friends. Being forthcoming may decrease the tsunami of tasks that would have otherwise come your way.\u201d\n\n4.

Say no to unlimited time with family\n\nIf spending time with family is difficult, Stockwell suggests bringing a board game, or some other activity, to create a new focus while everyone is hanging out. If a conversation turns to something you don\u2019t want to discuss, be kind but firm by saying \u201cI would rather not talk about that.\u201d Also, set a non-negotiable departure time to limit the hours you spend together.\n\nIt\u2019s important to set aside time every day to do something that nourishes you.
