If the violence is going to be reduced there clearly needs to be a political process that allows people to talk to each other, rather than just shoot and kill,\" says Mr Keating.\n\nA US state department official told the BBC it remained the largest single international donor to Somalia and was committed to stabilisation in the country.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "The US is reopening its embassy in Mogadishu - but what's the country's involvement there?", "authors": ["Christopher Giles", "Bbc Reality Check"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2788/production/_109102101_gettyimages-973399126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
