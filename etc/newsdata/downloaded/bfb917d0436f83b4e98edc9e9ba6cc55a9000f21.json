There are plenty of options if you\u2019re thinking of a trendy getup, but perhaps none feels as timely, unexpected, and somehow inevitable as this sexy take on\u2026 the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich.\n\nI wish I was making this up, but I\u2019m not:\n\nMade by lingerie/swimwear/costume maker Yandy, this piece, technically dubbed the \u201cSold Out Chicken Sandwich\u201d for trademark reasons, is an ode to the Popeyes product that briefly set the food world on fire before disappearing without a trace. For only $79.95, you can get a skimpy velour bodysuit that features \u201ca strapless neckline, a ruffled bodice with a fuzzy textured chicken patty interior, a white SOLD OUT stamp, a cheeky cut back, and matching ruffled bun arm puffs,\u201d according to their product description.\n\nWhile this would seem like a naked cash grab (or at least a scantily-clad one), Yandy claims that the costume\u2019s creation was spurred on by expressly-stated demand, telling VICE that customers contacted the company to ask if they\u2019d be making a chicken sandwich costume. Director of Brand Marketing Alicia Thompson told VICE that \u201cwe were already in the midst of updating our top sexy food costumes for 2019 when the infamous chicken sandwich war happened,\u201d and the rest was history.\n\nWhat other sexy food costumes might Thompson be referring to? Well, there\u2019s the White Claw-inspired \u201cHard Outlaw\u201d costume, and also the sexy Beyond Burger costume, which is just a burger dress with a little \u201cplant based\u201d hat. I\u2019m sure Yandy tried to put some kind of keto diet costume together, but couldn\u2019t figure anything out in time.\n\nStill, the Sold Out Chicken Sandwich is the one that probably captures the culinary zeitgeist the best. And it\u2019s also definitive proof that literally much anything can be turned into a sexy Halloween costume with a little creativity and even less material. Given how popular the sandwich itself was, just don\u2019t be shocked if someone else shows up at the Halloween party in the exact same costume as you.", "description": "From the people who brought you a White Claw bodysuit", "authors": ["Tim Nelson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YMeZGGuIweEumIiPtqIgbQ--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MTYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/myrecipes_643/6efe85a419dcfebc3eeb90ddbbf1a790", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
