So I think when I moved to Hebden Bridge \u2013 that sense of community was there in that town, and that was one of the things I was trying to portray.\n\n\u2018So it was like a celebration. When I moved to colour, the work became more of a critique of society.\u2019\n\n\u2018I think black and white photos are more melancholy. I think it was easier to do the celebration in black and white and easier to do the critique in colour.\u2019\n\nBeaches and coastlines are a common theme across Martin\u2019s work. Not only do they appear in his upcoming book but they also featured heavily at his Only Human exhibition, which ran at the National Portrait Gallery, earlier this year.\n\n\u2018I have always been fascinated by the beach, ever since an early age,\u2019 he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I come from a family of bird watchers so we didn\u2019t get seaside resorts, we went to marshes and creeks and estuaries \u2013 so I was immediately hooked. I remember going to Brighton as a kid and then \u2013 when I went to Manchester Polytechnic \u2013 I visited Blackpool resort and since then I\u2019ve become addicted to beaches \u2013 not only in this country but the world over.\n\n\u2018My favourite resort in the UK is Tenby and I liked it so much I went and bought a flat there, with a view over the sea.\n\n\u2018I could just sit and watch the sea, it\u2019s better than watching the TV, it just keeps on giving.\n\n\u2018Anyone who gets tired of watching the sea doesn\u2019t deserve to be alive. That\u2019s a bit dramatic isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\nThe new book not only documents Martin\u2019s travels across the UK but features shots taken in India and China in the mid-1980s. In total, readers can expect more than 20 previously unseen photographs with people at the heart of them \u2013 in true Parr style.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m interested in people, in observing and documenting,\u2019 he says. \u2018Of course, life has moved on, photography has moved on, I\u2019ve moved on \u2013 the world has changed. I\u2019m trying to keep up.\n\n\u2018If I get 10 really good shots a year, I say it\u2019s a pretty good year. And to achieve that I\u2019ve taken nearly half a million.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what makes a great photo for Martin?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the moment when everything comes together and there\u2019s some kind of tensional point, or contradiction of ambiguity illustrated.\n\n\u2018And the other thing is, to articulate that is very difficult, which is why I\u2019m a photographer and not a poet. But you know it when you see it, kind of thing,\u2019 he explains.\n\nAlmost 50 years on from the start of his career \u2013 and with advances in technology \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say that a lot has changed in the world of photography.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s first gone from analogue and all those horrible chemicals to digital. But also the introduction of the smartphone.\n\n\u2018Everyone has a camera all the time with them and we are all shooting constantly. It\u2019s the biggest democratic art form in the world and that in itself is an achievement.\n\n\u2018Photography sounds so simple and straightforward but, in fact, it is quite difficult to find your vision, to find something that\u2019s new and unique to yourself.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of bad photography too, remember, we don\u2019t know how many millions of photos will be uploaded onto Facebook today alone, let alone Instagram or anything else.\n\n\u2018Most of them won\u2019t be any good \u2013 which is good news for us photographers who take it more seriously.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Martin has always been a fan of English photographer Tony Ray-Jones. More specifically, it was Ray-Jones\u2019 different way of looking at the world that has influenced Martin over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When I was at college someone came in and talked about Tony Ray-Jones and I was completely smitten and it suddenly made me realise what was possible and what I could do myself and that therefore is very inspirational,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I think he took this spatial way of looking. He was as much interested in the spaces between things as the subject itself but that hadn\u2019t really twigged in the UK because we were too narrative-driven.\n\n\u2018So I\u2019ve always been a fan of his and I recently did a project where I went through his old contact prints and looked at the pictures that he overlooked and put those into this show, along with his iconic pictures. We are also doing a show which has the iconic photos. And then we\u2019ll show the new prints that I have discovered when I looked through the contact prints.\u2019\n\nThe exhibition opens the same day as Parr\u2019s book is released, on October 16, and is set to mark the important contribution that Ray-Jones (and his legacy), has made to British documentary photography.\n\nSo with a book launch and a sister exhibition on Ray-Jones running alongside it, what\u2019s next for the acclaimed photographer?\n\n\u2018This year I\u2019m doing a book, in the next month or so, about selfies and people taking selfies \u2013 that\u2019s a modern trend \u2013 20 years ago it didn\u2019t exist. And now, as you know, it\u2019s everywhere. You can\u2019t avoid selfie takers, especially if you go to anything remotely touristy.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a new phenomenon, it\u2019s interesting to look at and you actually have the benefit of looking at people and looking at the thing they are photographing all in one viewfinder.\n\n\u2018More and more people use instant photography and that\u2019s good news for photographers as people are keen to see what we get up to.\u2019\n\nEarly Works by Martin Parr comes out on 16 October 2019 and is available to buy online.\n\nMORE: New Hunger Games prequel book confirmed as The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\n\nMORE: The 2019 Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards will improve your Friday\n\nMORE: Stunning shot of heron peering through bars wins British Wildlife Photography Awards\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Focusing on shots taken from 1970 to 1984, the book delves into Martin\u2019s early black and white photography.", "authors": ["Lizzie Thomson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/web-Manorhamilton-Sheep-Fair-County-Leitrim-Ireland-1981-by-Martin-Parr-fe10_1570799431.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
