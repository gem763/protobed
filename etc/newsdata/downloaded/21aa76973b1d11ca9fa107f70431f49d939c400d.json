Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who supports sanctions against Israel, has published an op-ed in Thursday\u2019s Washington Post that attacks President Donald Trump\u2019s use of sanctions as \u201cpart of a failed foreign policy playbook.\u201d\n\nOmar came out in support of the anti-Israel \u201cboycott, divestment, sanctions\u201d (BDS) movement shortly after being elected to Congress in 2018 (and after misleading voters during the campaign into believing she did not support BDS).\n\nShe also co-sponsored a House resolution earlier this year supporting the BDS movement. Israel barred her from entering the country in August, in accordance with an Israeli law that prevents BDS supporters from visiting.\n\nIn her Post op-ed, Omar attacks sanctions against Turkey \u2014 even though they led to that country accepting a cease-fire with Kurds in northern Syria \u2014 and argues that sanctions are an overly punitive and counter-productive tool:\n\nIn so much of our foreign policy, we rely on muscle memory and a limited toolbox to decide the best course of action. And, too often, sanctions regimes are ill considered, incoherent and counterproductive. Research has shown that sanctions rarely achieve their desired goals. In the worst-case scenario, they hurt the people of a country \u2014 generally the very people we\u2019re purporting to help \u2014 without making a dent in the country\u2019s behavior. And in the case of human rights abusers, research suggests that more abuses typically occur with economic sanctions in place than without them. Sanctions are not meant to be an end in themselves, but we too often use them as a lever without a plan for what comes after, whether they achieve the desired result or not.\n\nOmar also attacks U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela. She does not attempt to explain why Israel alone is deserving of sanctions, or why the reasoning she applies to other countries does not apply to the Jewish state.\n\nThroughout her first year in Congress, Omar has faced accusations of antisemitism. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) appointed Omar to the House Foreign Affairs Committee despite concern over her anti-Israel views.\n\nJoel B.
