Adam Schiff (D-CA) said at Northwestern University on Thursday that the House Democrats \u201cmight be forced to move forward on impeaching President Donald Trump before being able to \u2018flesh out the facts,\u2019\u201d which he blamed on the White House\u2019s \u201cobstructionist acts and delay tactics.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago Tribune led its reporting on Schiff\u2019s speech at the college \u2013 known for its journalism programs \u2013 with Schiff\u2019s claim, despite the fact that the when Democrats raised concerns about the president\u2019s phone conversation with the Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump released the transcript from the call.\n\nThe Tribune reported on Schiff\u2019s claim that Trump asked Zelenskiy and other foreign leaders to interfere in the U.S. elections, one of the most \u201cpernicious threats to our democracy\u201d coming from a presidency.\n\nAnd he\u2019s in a hurry to impeach a duly elected president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly concerned that there\u2019s a need to act expeditiously here,\u201d said Schif, who is leading the investigation as chairman of the House Oversight Committee. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to drag on forever.\u201d\n\nSchiff said:\n\nAt the same time, (the White House has) apparently every incentive to try to make it drag on forever. And there may very well come a point where we have to make the decision that the effort to obstruct has become such an impediment that we have reached a decision point \u2014 even in the absence of being able to fully follow and flesh out the facts surrounding the president\u2019s Ukraine conduct.\n\nThe Tribune reported on Schiff\u2019s speech:\n\nSchiff, a former federal prosecutor from California who is in his 10th term in the House, made the remarks while delivering Northwestern\u2019s 30th annual Richard W. Leopold Lecture. His talk was entitled \u201cThe Threat to Liberal Democracy at Home and Abroad.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s visit came just hours after Trump doubled-down on his call for foreign government investigations involving potential 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe Tribune did not include in its reporting that the government of Ukraine has already conducted an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s employment with an oil company in that country when his father was Vice President.\n\n\u201cSchiff said the Founding Fathers would have considered Trump\u2019s request for foreign involvement in domestic elections \u2018an offense of the greatest magnitude,\u2019\u201d the Tribune reported.\n\nSchiff said:\n\nI think one of the most pernicious threats to our democracy is one that\u2019s been revealed in just the last couple of weeks \u2014 and that is the president of the United States would use the full power of his office to attempt to coerce a foreign leader, the leader of another country \u2026 beholden to the United States for its defense, for its economy, for diplomatic support, (and) abuse the power of his office to coerce that country into intervening in our election on his behalf by investigating his political rival.\n\n\u201cAsked if he had a favorite nickname from Trump, Schiff criticized the president for using social media to invite \u2018violence,\u2019 such as referring to those who oppose him as a \u2018traitor or spy,\u2019\u201d the Tribune reported.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a favorite nickname, and I wish he would spend more time attending to the business of the country than making up new ones,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter @PennyStarrDC", "description": "Rep.
