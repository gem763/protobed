I don\u2019t play a ton of Pokemon, but I do enjoy the universe and I love learning more about the creatures in it. So, Here\u2019s Another Pokemon! It\u2019s Exploud!\n\nExploud Details\n\nType: Normal\n\nAverage Height: 4\u2018 11\"\n\nAverage Weight: 84kg.\n\nFirst Added In Generation III\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of the Butterfly Effect. Not the terrible movie starring Ashton Kutcher, but the phenomenon where a small event, like a butterfly flapping its wings, can change how tornados form or their path. Well, today I want to share with you a new phenomenon. I call it the Exploud Effect and it\u2019s a lot simpler to figure out. When an Exploud yells really loud, they cause earthquakes. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole effect.\n\nYes, according to Pokedex entries found on Bulbapedia, Exploud is able to cause earthquakes with their extremely loud and powerful yelling. After sucking in a large amount of air via a series of tubes on their body, Exploud can then expel that air in a loud roar. This roar causes tremors in the Earth that can create earthquakes.\n\nThis seems too dangerous to allow in competition. How sturdy are the arenas where Pokemon battles happen? Sturdy enough to withstand multiple earthquakes? What about the surrounding homes? Are people losing their houses because some idiot kid told his Exploud to keep screaming over and over? It just seems like an unnecessary amount of destruction.\n\nLuckily for people living in crappy apartments and old houses, Exploud only yells during battles. When they are just wandering around the woods or hanging out with others Pokemon, they use a series of whistles to communicate. Which could be annoying, but at least isn\u2019t destructive. A whistle ain\u2019t going to cause a giant earthquake. At least, I don\u2019t think it will.\n\nFavourite Fan Art\n\nSome folks will head out into the wilderness, get on top of a cliff and scream at the top of their lungs. The idea is to release stress, fear, pain, etc. Explouds have to be very careful where they attempt this action. Too close to a dam and they might flood the entire valley.\n\nRandom Fact", "description": "Every Pokemon is interesting and worth talking about.
