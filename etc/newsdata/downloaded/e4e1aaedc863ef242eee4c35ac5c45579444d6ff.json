We refuse to cooperate with a Government that has failed to protect us so criminally. In order to disrupt this toxic system we need to break the rules and highlight its failures.\n\n\"There are roughly 1000 jail cells in London - we filled many of them in April. If we fill them everyday - the streets will remain ours.\"\n\nArrested protesters are being told to refuse the bail conditions offered to them to fill up a cell at that station and to speed up the court process.\n\nA police source told The Telegraph: \"It's not unusual for people not to cooperate when they are arrested. So it's not a great surprise that this is what they are looking to do.\"", "description": "The Prime Minister's father, Stanley Johnson, is to address Extinction Rebellion protesters today in Trafalgar Square - two days after Boris Johnson called them 'uncooperative crusties' in 'hemp-smelling bivouacs'.", "authors": ["Gareth Davies", "Breaking News Editor", "Hamish De Bretton-Gordon", "Laura Freeman", "Owen Paterson", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212405360-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoC1KLvdKTc_v1L1R92-Vtd2CwSoF2IJS_UoSuIi6J98.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
