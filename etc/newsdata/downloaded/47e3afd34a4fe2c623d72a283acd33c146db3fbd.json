End of.\u2019 Jacklin told the Weekly Dartscast.\n\nIt was known that the PDC had the final say on picks in the Grand Slam, with the event firmly under its own banner, merely offering invitations to BDO players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPDC chief executive Matthew Porter told Live Darts before the picks were announced: \u2018We had a good meeting with Des Jacklin and his commercial advisers, he\u2019s got a set of challenges that he\u2019s facing himself and I don\u2019t envy him, I think he\u2019s doing his best.\n\n\u2018I made it clear to him that ultimately the players that play in that tournament is the PDC\u2019s decision. We like to work with the BDO, we accept their nominations, we review them and comment on them.\u2019\n\nOn how much input the BDO had over their picks, ITV pundit Chris Mason told Live Darts: \u2018Not a lot, you\u2019ve got to remember the PDC is a successful commercial brand, they want what\u2019s best and I think they pretty much nailed it.\u2019\n\nOne name that is believed to have been on the BDO\u2019s list is Nick Kenny, who insists that he was \u2018guaranteed\u2019 a place at this year\u2019s event.\n\nThe Welshman tweeted: \u2018I was told I was one of the eight at the end of the season through my sponsor who was in contact with the BDO CEO. Later I learned that PDC ultimately made the choice and Duzza [Glen Durrant] would be in.\u2019\n\nKenny, who goes into the 2020 BDO World Championship as the sixth seed, confirmed to Metro.co.uk that he was disappointed to be left out, after being promised a spot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving met the BDO\u2019s requirements to be nominated for the Grand Slam, Kenny was under the impression his spot was secure, but missed out as the PDC were keen to have reigning BDO world champion, but current PDC player, Durrant involved.\n\nWhile his non-selection is not the BDO\u2019s fault, the Welshman is going through a tough time, having sat out of the World Masters with a broken foot and missing out on Wolverhampton has been another kick in the teeth, which he could have avoided if he hadn\u2019t been told his Grand Slam place was safe.\n\nThe Grand Slam gets underway on 9 November, after the final eight places are secured through a PDC Tour Card qualifier, with the full list of entries here.\n\nMORE: Des Jacklin won\u2019t be resigning as BDO chairman, calls for unity, positivity and support\n\nMORE: Confusion reigns at World Masters as fake names, a redraw and a resignation blight BDO\u2019s oldest major", "description": "The BDO did not get their way when choosing their representatives in the Grand Slam of Darts this year, with the PDC overruling their nominations.
