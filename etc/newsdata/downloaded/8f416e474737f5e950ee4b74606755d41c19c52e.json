The Romanian committed a miniscule three unforced errors.\n\n\"Wimbledon, Simona played unbelievable,\" said Williams. \"There was nothing I could do that day. Also, I didn't have too much time to prep, and playing someone that played that unbelievable was just a deadly combination for me.\"\n\nThat lack of preparation was because of a knee injury but the knee now better, Williams enjoyed a fruitful training block after Wimbledon prior to competing at the Rogers Cup in Toronto.\n\nWilliams ultimately had to retire in the final against home favorite Andreescu due to back spasms and was consoled by her opponent in a moment that went viral.\n\n\"I felt more prepared this tournament,\" she said. \"I joked I trained more for Canada than I did for any other tournament this year.\n\n\"I just had a really tough year with injuries, mostly bad luck. I just needed to get injury free.\"\n\nMore chilled\n\nAnd now she seems to be. So is this Williams' best chance to get to 24?\n\n\"I don't know,\" Williams said. \"I literally haven't thought about it this tournament. I've been way more chill.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Simona Halep on winning her first Wimbledon title Replay More Videos ...

Those first two games took an extended 15 minutes.\n\nThere was more woe for Svitolina and her player box -- which included her boyfriend, Gael Monfils, who lost in the quarterfinals Wednesday -- when she couldn't break from 40-0 on the Williams serve at 3-1.\n\nThat really was her last chance to gain a foothold.\n\n\"I don't think she played amazing,\" Svitolina told reporters. \"But she played very high level at the beginning where you had to make a difference. I think that's what really made a difference today.\"\n\nWilliams agreed that she wasn't at her finest, but 34 winners and 20 unforced errors certainly isn't a shabby differential.\n\nWilliams booked a spot in the final almost exactly 20 years after appearing in her first grand slam final at the 1999 US Open, before Andreescu was even born. That gap is a record -- another record she owns.\n\n\"To be in yet another final, it seems honestly, crazy,\" Williams said. \"But I don't really expect too much less.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED The most successful family affair in tennis Replay More Videos ...

She has spent an economical one hour, 54 minutes combined on court in her last two matches, crushing China's Wang Qiang in the quarterfinals and surrendering only one set en route to the final.\n\nWilliams moving great\n\nPutting the knee injury behind her, Williams moved supremely well in Toronto and looks to have also overcome the back problem as well as the rolled ankle she sustained this week against Petra Martic.\n\nShe patrolled the court sublimely to bring up a break point at 1-1 in the second and even, rarely for her, served and volleyed.\n\nSvitolina had won the last time they faced off, though Williams was suffering from a shoulder injury back then at the Rio Olympics in 2016.\n\nIt's all going so well for Williams but the question indeed is whether she can produce in the final and win a major for the first time since becoming a mom to daughter Olympia almost exactly two years ago.\n\nJUST WATCHED Elina Svitolina on the WTA Finals and Serena Replay More Videos ...

She's amazing.\"\n\nBianca Andreescu reached her first grand slam final at the US Open.\n\nIf she upsets Williams, Andreescu would become her country's first grand slam singles champion and the first female teen to win a major since Maria Sharapova at the 2006 US Open.\n\nAndreescu saved all six break points she faced in the first set of the second semi against Bencic -- including a set point at 4-5. Meanwhile, she didn't manufacture one break point in the set.\n\nLosing the opener stung former teen prodigy Bencic and so did blowing a 5-2 lead in the second.", "description": "Serena Williams moved into a 10th US Open final and picked up a record-equaling 101st win in New York by routing Elina Svitolina 6-3, 6-1 but the number she might still be preoccupied with is 24.", "authors": ["Ravi Ubha"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190905194054-serena-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
