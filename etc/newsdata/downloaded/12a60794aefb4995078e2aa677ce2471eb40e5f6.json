(AP) - Bills coach Sean McDermott suddenly has bigger worries than Josh Allen\u2019s carelessness with the football.\n\nHe\u2019s not sure when the second-year starter will be healthy enough to be cleared to play.\n\nAllen was placed in the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit by Patriots defensive back Jonathan Jones in the opening minute of the fourth quarter of a 16-10 loss to New England on Sunday.\n\nPutting aside the three interceptions Allen threw, McDermott\u2019s biggest question was why Jones wasn\u2019t ejected.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room in football for that,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cI thought he should have been thrown out. But other than that, I\u2019m not going to get into that. That\u2019s for the league to get into.\u201d\n\nThe hit occurred when Allen scrambled out of the pocket and burst through a hole up the middle while facing third-and-8 at the New England 45. He gained 7 yards before Jones closed in on him, lowered his helmet and struck the quarterback in the crown of his helmet. Jones was flagged for a personal foul for unnecessary roughness.\n\nAllen lay on the field for several minutes before hopping up on his own. He was briefly evaluated on the sideline before being escorted up the tunnel. Allen was spotted in the locker room chatting with teammates following the game.\n\nNFL officiating chief Al Riveron told a pool reporter the decision to not eject Jones came because the hit did not rise to the level of the league standard for disqualification.\n\n\u201cThere was a foul called and obviously the penalty stood, but we did not feel this contact rose to that level,\u201d Riveron said, who also noted Jones was turning his head just before hitting Allen.\n\nBills safety Micah Hyde questioned the official\u2019s judgment saying he or any of his teammates would have been ejected for a similar hit on New England\u2019s Tom Brady.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our quarterback. We ride or die with him,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cTo see that happen, Josh didn\u2019t slide, but at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a running back, you can\u2019t head to the head.\u201d\n\nJones defended the hit saying it was never his intent to hurt Allen.\n\n\u201cNo malice or intent. Just a part of football,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re just running around playing football. I hope he\u2019s OK. I\u2019m going to check on him.\u201d\n\nAllen finished going 13 of 28 for 153 yards, and scored on a 1-yard touchdown dive.\n\nAllen\u2019s uncertain status leaves Buffalo with veteran backup Matt Barkley the only quarterback on the active roster in preparing to play at Tennessee next weekend. Buffalo then enters its bye week.\n\nThe loss prevented Buffalo (3-1) from getting off to its first 4-0 start since 2008.\n\nThough the Bills defense held Brady in check, their offense was busy coughing up the ball at critical moments for the third time in four games.\n\nAllen threw three interceptions, two of which translated into a touchdown and a field goal. Punter Corey Bojorquez also had a punt blocked by J.C. Jackson, which led to Matthew Slater returning it 11 yards for a touchdown to put the Patriots up 13-0 in the first quarter.\n\nMcDermott was unhappy with Allen\u2019s continuing string of committing turnovers. He\u2019s now thrown six interceptions and lost two fumbles in four starts this season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a young quarterback and sometimes they have to learn those lessons. Those are hard lessons and we have to continue to coach it up,\u201d McDermott said.\n\nThe game was decided on Buffalo\u2019s fourth turnover with 1:27 left. Facing third-and-9 on the New England 39, Barkley was pressured by linebacker Kyle Van Noy, who got his hand on the quarterback\u2019s chest. That forced Barkley to throw the ball up into the air, and have it easily picked off by Jamie Collins.\n\nThe loss spoiled a stout effort by a Bills defense which limited the Patriots to just 11 first downs and 224 yards.\n\nBrady finished 18 of 39 for 150 yards and an interception. He was picked off by Hyde in the end zone on third-and-goal from the 2 in the second quarter.\n\nBrady\u2019s 45.9 passer rating was the sixth lowest of his career and lowest since finishing with a 34 rating in a 27-20 loss to Indianapolis on Nov. 5, 2006.\n\nBarkley lamented how the Bills let the Patriots off the hook.\n\n\u201cEspecially with the way our defense played and where we had the ball at the end of the game, it\u2019s tough,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cThis is a tough one.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bills coach Sean McDermott suddenly has bigger worries than Josh Allen's carelessness with the football.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/patriots_bills_football_34529_c0-73-2906-1767_s1770x1032.jpg?232847d9c82050de5f71d7d0df45c8f58613236c", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
