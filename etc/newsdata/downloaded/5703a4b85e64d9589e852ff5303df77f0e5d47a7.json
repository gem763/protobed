No \u2014 that\u2019s a fake statement, writes Tech 4 Peace on its popular Facebook page.\n\nWas a young protester shot dead this morning? No, his friends confirm he\u2019s still alive.\n\nDid the family of ex-dictator Saddam Hussein back the rallies? Another no.\n\nOne of the most common forms of fallacy spread online is the misidentification of security personnel who shot at protesters, said a Tech 4 Peace verifier identifying himself as Sami.\n\n\u201cPictures of people accused of killing demonstrators have been circulating for days,\u201d Sami told AFP.\n\nThey included photographs of Iraqi soldiers who had in fact died fighting the Islamic State group several years ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also debunked dozens of claims of people accused of being jihadists, with their names and photographs circulated online, who have nothing to do with terrorism,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Alert! Fake news!\u2019 \u2013\n\nProtests erupted in Iraq\u2019s capital and further south on October 1, first demanding more jobs and an end to corruption before evolving into calls for an overhaul of the entire political system.\n\nAuthorities swiftly imposed internet restrictions, first banning some social media before imposing a total blackout.\n\nBut activists at Tech 4 Peace were just as fast: by the second day of protests, they were trawling through online platforms full of inaccurate or totally fabricated claims.\n\n\u201cWe found videos with false titles or bad sourcing, posted by people, pages or other social media accounts that sometimes don\u2019t even know they\u2019re distributing false information,\u201d said Sami.\n\nHe and his colleagues also often find falsified government decrees, which they repost on the group\u2019s Facebook page with a red watermark saying: \u201cAlert! Fake news!\u201d\n\nIraq has a plethora of television stations and newspapers, but most people use Facebook or messaging application Whatsapp to share news.\n\nThat makes it easy for unverified information \u2014 including mistaken rumours of deaths \u2014 to spread.\n\n\u201cA former president even issued his condolences for an artist who was still very much alive,\u201d said Saad al-Kaabi, an Iraqi blogger.\n\n\u201cAuthorities sometimes even launch test runs, spreading rumours on the internet to see the street\u2019s reaction,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Power of propaganda \u2013\n\nA total of 157 people were killed in the first week of rallies, authorities said in a recent report, a majority of them protesters who died of wounds to the head or chest.\n\nThe government has kept restrictions on some social media sites in place, but even regular Iraqis are circumventing them en masse by using VPNs.\n\nActivists called for protests to resume on Friday October 25, but they began hours ahead of schedule on Thursday evening.\n\nMany seemed nervous about whether they were receiving accurate portrayals of the reality on the ground.\n\n\u201cThe situation is always complicated, and plenty of people could easily fall victim to rumours,\u201d said Reda Najmaddin, a 50-year-old day labourer.\n\nIraqis have been hoodwinked in dramatic fashion before.\n\nIS used the power of its propaganda in 2014 to claim it had taken a series of Iraqi cities even before it had militarily conquered them.\n\nSuch claims spread fear among security forces, ultimately making them a self-fulfilling prophecy when troops fled.\n\nSome worry that people being taken in by fake news could again cause major destabilisation, including Susanne Aziz, a 46-year-old housewife.\n\n\u201cNo one knows what could happen,\u201d she told AFP.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 From accusations long-dead soldiers shot protesters to jihadist statements backing the rallies, fabricated news has swirled around", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/3f6cb8_an-iraqi-protester-waves-national-flag-as-he-stands-atop-burnt-out-police-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
