Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk unveiled solar roof shingles as part of his push to buy SolarCity, the automaker says it finally has a version of the tiles that it can mass produce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite hard,\u201d Musk said on a conference call late Friday. \u201cRoofs need to last a long time. When you add electrification to the roof, it\u2019s a fair bit of complexity.\u201d\n\nThe sleek roof is a key part of Tesla\u2019s push to revive its struggling solar business. Musk unveiled the product in 2016, but the company hasn\u2019t been able to bring production up to full scale. The photovoltaic tiles are designed to resemble regular shingles, unlike solar panels atop a roof.\n\nThe latest version of the shingles was introduced after Tesla lost its status as the biggest U.S. rooftop solar company. It\u2019s also been sued by Walmart Inc. over fires at a half-dozen of the big-box stores that had Tesla solar systems, and the company still faces litigation from shareholders over the controversial SolarCity acquisition.\n\nTesla initially said it would have a slow roll-out of the solar roof. But issues with aesthetics, cost and manufacturing process have dogged production. At one point in 2018, Tesla was making enough solar-roof shingles for just three to five homes a week.\n\nEarlier this year, Musk declared 2019 as \u201cthe year of the solar roof.\u201d In July, he tweeted that Tesla was \u201cspooling up production line rapidly,\u201d and that he hoped to manufacture about 1,000 roofs each week by year-end.\n\nOn the call Friday to discuss the third version of the roof, he reiterated the goal of getting to 1,000 roofs per week in the next several months but acknowledged that there might be setbacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an odd and weird product,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would anyone make a solar roof? How strange. But it just is a thing that should be. So we\u2019re going to make it.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Dana Hull.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Brian Eckhouse in New York at beckhouse@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Joe Ryan, Michael B.
