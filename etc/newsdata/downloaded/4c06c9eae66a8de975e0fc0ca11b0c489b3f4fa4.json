REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\n(Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it was challenging a federal judge\u2019s order that prevents the software maker from informing one of its large corporate customers that the U.S. government has issued a warrant for the customer\u2019s data.\n\n\"We have challenged that order in the lower court, and we will pursue an appeal in the appellate court if necessary,\" said Dev Stahlkopf, Microsoft's general counsel said in a blogpost. (bit.ly/2lQsVeX)\n\nThe warrants, called \u201csneak and peek\u201d, do not require the subject of a federal inquiry to be informed that the U.S. government has requested for their data.\n\nIn 2016, Microsoft, with backing from other technology giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), had sued the government over this practice.\n\nStahlkopf said Microsoft had limited information on this specific case, but said the customer had thousands of employees.\n\n\u201cBased on the limited information available to us in this case, we feel the secrecy order was too broadly drawn and is inconsistent with the U.S. government\u2019s policy that secrecy orders be narrowly tailored,\u201d Stahlkopf said.", "description": "Microsoft said on Wednesday it was challenging a federal judge's order that prevents the software maker from informing one of its large corporate customers that the U.S. government has issued a warrant for the customer's data.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433937963&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O2DE", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
