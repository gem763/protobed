Imports of American goods sank 20.6% from the year before to $10.6 billion, a slight improvement over August\u2019s 22% decline.\n\nPresident Donald Trump agreed Friday to put off an additional tariff hike planned for this week on Chinese imports. In exchange, he said Beijing agreed to buy up to $50 billion of American farm goods. But they reported no agreements on disputes over China\u2019s trade surplus and technology policies that brought on the 15-month-old fight.\n\n\u201cThe external environment facing China\u2019s foreign trade development is still complicated and severe. Instability and uncertainty are increasing,\u201d a customs agency spokesman, Li Kuiwen, said at a news conference.\n\nTit-for-tat tariff hikes on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods have battered manufacturers and farmers on both sides and disrupted supply chains worldwide. Uncertainty has prompted some companies to postpone investments, adding to downward pressure on global growth and fueling financial market jitters.\n\nChina\u2019s global exports fell 1.4% from a year earlier to $218.1 billion. Imports fell 5.8% to $178.5 billion.\n\nThe slump adds to pressure on President Xi Jinping\u2019s government to shore up cooling economic growth and prevent politically risky job losses.\n\nChinese growth fell to its lowest level in at least 26 years in the quarter ending in June, decelerating to 6.2% over a year earlier.\n\nForecasters expect growth in the July-September quarter, due to be reported this week, to fall further to as low as 5.9%, sinking below the ruling Communist Party\u2019s official target for the year of at least 6%.\n\n\u201cWhile import growth should start to recover soon, it will take longer before export growth bottoms out,\u201d said Martin Lynge Rasmussen of Capital Economics in a report. \u201cThe mini U.S.-China trade deal reached on Friday doesn\u2019t alter the outlook significantly.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States contracted by 16.5% from a year earlier but stood at $25.9 billion.\n\nIncreased exports to Britain and other European countries and developing markets such as Vietnam helped to offset some of the losses. China\u2019s global trade surplus expanded by 42.2% to $39.7 billion.\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, Chinese imports of American goods were off 26.4% at $90.6 billion. Exports to the United States were off 10.7% at $312 billion.\n\nTrump put off a tariff hike planned for Tuesday on $250 billion of Chinese goods. But Washington still is planning a Dec. 15 tariff hike on $160 billion of smartphones and other imports.\n\nBefore then, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend an economic conference in Chile in mid-November. That is raising hopes a face-to-face meeting might produce progress.\n\nTalks broke down in May over Beijing\u2019s insistence that Trump\u2019s punitive tariffs had to be lifted once a deal took effect. Washington says some must remain in place to ensure Chinese compliance. Trump and Xi agreed in June to resume negotiations but they have announced no breakthroughs.", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China's trade with the United States fell by double digits again in September amid a tariff war that threatens to tip the global economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/13/92befc_china-trade-95154-women-shop-shanghai-disney-flagship-store-hongqiao-railway-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
