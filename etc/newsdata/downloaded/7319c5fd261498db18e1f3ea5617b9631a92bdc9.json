REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk\n\nAt the first debate since Warren climbed into a virtual tie with former Vice President Joe Biden in many Democratic opinion polls, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar accused Warren of being evasive on her plan for universal healthcare.\n\n\u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where to send the invoice,\u201d Klobuchar, a U.S. senator from Minnesota, told Warren. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nWarren said she would not sign any bill that required a tax increase on middle-class families and promised the proposal, which is also backed by her fellow progressive, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, would lower costs for everyday Americans.\n\n\u201cI have made clear what my principles are here, and that is that costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and, for hard-working middle class families, costs will go down,\u201d she said.\n\nThe expansive Medicare for All proposal, based on the government-run healthcare plan for Americans over age 65, has divided Democratic presidential contenders. Many other candidates back a Medicare-based plan as just one option for Americans seeking healthcare coverage.\n\nButtigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, plugged his plan for \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It,\u201d a proposal that Warren poked fun at.\n\n\u201cWhenever someone hears the term Medicare for All Who Want It, understand what that really means is Medicare for All Who Can Afford It,\u201d Warren said.\n\nThe dozen candidates cramming the debate stage in the electoral battleground state of Ohio made for the most crowded debate so far in the Democratic race to pick a challenger to Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\nThe 10 candidates who took part in last month\u2019s third debate in Texas all qualified for Tuesday\u2019s event, along with U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer, a billionaire activist who is making his first debate appearance.\n\nThe debate comes at a critical time, as Biden has seen his once solid lead in opinion polls in the Democratic race diminished by Warren, a leader of the party\u2019s progressive movement, who has steadily risen over the past two months.\n\nIt also comes as all the Democratic contenders fight to be heard through the din of news about the congressional impeachment probe of Trump, with less than four months remaining until the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 3, 2020.\n\nBACKING IMPEACHMENT PROBE\n\nDemocrats uniformly defended the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, saying the president needed to be held accountable for his actions and for stonewalling Congress on its probe.\n\nThe investigation focuses on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his unsubstantiated allegation that Biden improperly tried to aid his son Hunter\u2019s business interests in Ukraine.\n\nBiden and Sanders both said that Trump was \u201cthe most corrupt president in history,\u201d and Congress would be remiss if it did not pursue the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine and that\u2019s what we should be focused on,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat I think is important is we focus on why it\u2019s so important to remove this man from office.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (29 Images)\n\nWarren said: \u201cImpeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences.\u201d\n\nButtigieg said \u201cthe president had left Congress with no choice.\u201d But some Democrats warned that the party should bring Americans on board to support the probe.\n\n\u201cWe have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable,\u201d U.S. Senator Cory Booker said.", "description": "Several Democratic presidential contenders went on the attack against surging U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren during a debate on Tuesday, pushing her to explain how she would pay for her ambitious Medicare for All healthcare plan.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441292648&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F00F", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
