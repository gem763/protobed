We all heard the critiques.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n- Whiteside is a culture problem\n\n- Whiteside can't stay focused\n\n- He's inconsistent\n\nWell, it's only been two games, but the big man is proving his value already. After an impressive first game, Whiteside followed it up with a stellar performance vs. Sacramento: 22 points, 9 rebounds, 3 assists. Damian Lillard spoke to Brooke Olzendam after the win in Sacramento alongside Whiteside and had the following to say:\n\nTo start the season off, I think everybody got excited about his effort on both ends on the floor, because it was actually in front of us. For him to put back to back games together, that's really encouraging for our team because it's going to be a big deal.\n\nAnd it is fair to say that Rip City Drive host and Meyers Leonard super fan (sarcasm font) Chad Doing is happy with the way this trade turned out:\n\nWe need more \"experts\" to tell us they are miffed at the trade to acquire Whiteside.

Not only now, but even upon Nurk's return, because depth in your front court is never a bad thing when you're looking at making a deep playoff run.\n\nHey 'experts' --- how do you like that Hassan Whiteside trade now? originally appeared on NBC Sports Northwest", "description": "The big man is off to an impressive start.", "authors": ["Nbcs Nw Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5Qi8aWRqtU6ECSuA9B5tDA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RIveOHeEAv7jcjHCvifIMQ--~B/aD0xODI0O3c9MjczNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_sports_northwest_40/979b7f5d98028e267c6162e6ad27a877", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
