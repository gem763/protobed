Slippery runner but opportunities were few and far between.\n\nS'Busiso Nkosi saw few opportunities to run in a slow game in Sunday morning's semi-final\n\nLukhanyo Am 6\n\nPopped dislocated finger back in place after five minutes and was barely called upon in attack as Boks went through the forwards.\n\nDamian de Allende 8\n\nOne of the most improved players in the world. Powered through three defenders to score breakthrough try. Dominant tackles.\n\nThe southern hemisphere side were the first to score a try, with Damian de Allende going over\n\nMakazole Mapimpi 6.5\n\nDid his best to chase De Klerk\u2019s cross-field kicks but otherwise had to feed of scraps of ball out wide.\n\nHandre Pollard 7.5\n\nHeld his nerve to kick five from five. Unforced errors meant he struggled to set free speedsters out wide.\n\nFaf De Klerk 7.5\n\nPinned Welsh back with constant kicking and harried attackers with his high energy chasing. Dropped an easy ball into touch.\n\nTendai Mtawarira 6 (Kitschoff 48, 6.5)\n\nNo chants of \u2018Beast!\u2019 as he did not touch the ball once before being subbed in second half. Won an early scrum penalty.\n\nMbongeni Mbonambi 6.5 (Marx 48, 7)\n\nConceded a cheap penalty for taking out Wainwright before being replaced by more explosive presence of Marx.\n\nMbongeni Mbonambi didn't have the performance he will need to produce against England\n\nFrans Malherbe 6.5 (Koch 48, 8)\n\nUsed all of his physicality to grind down Welsh \u2013 crunching Owens in tackle \u2013 before replacement heavies were unloaded.\n\nEben Etzebeth 6.5 (Snyman 53, 6)\n\nPicked up Halfpenny like a ragdoll early on but some way short of 2015 from when he was one of the best in the world.\n\nLodewyk De Jager 6.5 (Mostert 58, 6.5)\n\nStuck it up the jumper and used all 19st to batter Welsh forwards \u2013 but only made 5m from five carries.\n\nSiya Kolisi 7 (Louw 69, 7)\n\nConstant pressure on Welsh half-backs as he attempted to charge down kicks. Could now make history as Boks\u2019 first black World Cup winning captain.\n\nPieter-Steph du Toit 9\n\nThe blueprint for South Africa\u2019s physicality with 18 tackles and a constant nuisance with counter rucking at the breakdown.\n\nPieter-Steph du Toit was Sportsmail's man of the match, crushing Wales with his physicality\n\nDuane Vermeulen 8\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s very own Thor showed his brute force when he ran into 21st Francis and dislocated his shoulder.\n\nTOTAL - 103.5/150\n\nSUBSTITUTES - 7.5\n\nHead coach Rassie Erasmus had so much power on bench and used it to good effect.\n\nWales\n\nLeigh Halfpenny 6.5\n\nSome good, some bad under the high bombs South Africa constantly put up. Wales missed the injured Liam Williams.\n\nGeorge North 6 (Watkin 39, 6)\n\nPulled his hamstring unopposed while chasing a kick, and was distraught as he went off.\n\nGeorge North was forced off in the first-half with injury, a big blow to Warren Gatland's side\n\nJonathan Davies 7\n\nPatched up knee for this huge Test, and provided a lovely assist to Adams late on.\n\nHadleigh Parkes 6\n\nLittle go-forward in midfield, as he has managed in previous Tests. Was carrying shoulder and hand injuries.\n\nJosh Adams 7.5\n\nTook his sixth try of the World Cup - which may see him take the top-scorer prize unless Mapimpi scores next week.\n\nWales levelled the scores with a Josh Adams' drive and Leigh Halfpenny's conversion\n\nDan Biggar 6 (Patchell 58, 7)\n\nCould not get the Welsh attack firing, and was taken off before the hour despite kicking all his goals.\n\nGareth Davies 6 (T Williams 48, 7)\n\nUncharacteristically slow to get Wales moving in attack, in what was a pedestrian game.\n\nWyn Jones 7 (Carre 55, 6)\n\nOne crucial turnover before he went off, when being whacked by Eben Etzebeth, crowned a decent night.\n\nKen Owens 7 (Dee 73, 6)\n\nCut his head again in the battle - one of so many with incredible resilience in this Welsh team.\n\nKen Owens took a bloody cut to the head but battled on in a fighting Wales team\n\nTomas Francis 6 (Lewis 36, 6)\n\nLooked to have seriously injured his shoulder when tackling Duane Vermeulen\n\nJake Ball 6.5 (Beard 59, 6)\n\nTussle with de Klerk was one of the few notable moments he had. Scrum held up just about when he was on.\n\nAlun Wyn Jones 7\n\nThe emotional titan could not drag his Welsh side home. This should not - and is not likely to be - the end for him in a red shirt.\n\nAlun Wyn Jones' experience and grit could not push Wales over the line in the semi-final\n\nAaron Wainwright 7 (Shingler 69, 6)\n\nSuch a long career ahead, at just 22 he has been one of the stars of the World Cup. Not overawed by massive Boks.\n\nJustin Tipuric 6.5\n\nCould not release his almost unrivalled skills in the wider channels.\n\nRoss Moriarty 6\n\nUnable to impose himself amid a forest of Bok trees.\n\nTOTAL - 98/150\n\nSUBSTITUTES - 6\n\nInjuries meant bench was summoned earlier than hoped and it could not turn tide.", "description": "WILL KELLEHER AND NIK SIMON AT THE YOKOHAMA STADIUM: South Africa edged a battling Wales in a tight World Cup semi-final on Sunday to book their spot in the tournament decider.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher", "Nik Simon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/12/20242388-0-image-a-34_1572179193399.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
