The story is based on an upcoming book by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\u201d about the junior justice\u2019s brutal confirmation battle last year.\n\nHeadlined \u201cBrett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not,\u201d the story was primarily about Deborah Ramirez, a Connecticut woman who alleged that Kavanaugh, as a freshman at Yale in 1983, had pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her. Kavanaugh has denied those claims.\n\nYet the authors said they\u2019d uncovered a similar story involving Kavanaugh at another freshman year party, where he allegedly exposed himself and friends pushed his penis into the hands of a female student. The story said former classmate Max Stier reported the incident to the FBI and senators as Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination was being discussed, but said Stier would not discuss it with the authors. Kavanaugh would not comment on the story, a court spokeswoman said on Monday.\n\nAfter the story was posted online but before it was in the print edition, the Times revised the story to add that the book reported that the woman supposedly involved in the incident declined to be interviewed, and that her friends say she doesn\u2019t recall the incident. While an editor\u2019s note pointed out the revision, it did not say why those facts had been left out in the first place. A Times spokeswoman said no one was available for an interview on Monday.\n\nThe failure to initially report that the woman did not remember the alleged incident \u201cis one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent memory,\u201d John McCormack wrote in the conservative magazine National Review.\n\nThe Washington Post, detailing its own decision on the story, called into question the Times\u2019 decision to run with the accusation in the first place.\n\nThe Post said that last year it had independently confirmed that lawmakers and authorities knew of the second accusation against Kavanaugh, but did not write about it because the woman involved would not comment and the alleged witnesses were not identified.\n\nThe book\u2019s authors wrote that they had corroborated the second misconduct allegation with two officials who said they had communicated with Stier. The newspaper did not identify them.\n\nPlacement of the accusation in the midst of an opinion section piece struck many in the journalism community as odd.\n\n\u201cHow is this not a front-page story?\u201d wrote Tom Jones of the journalism think tank the Poynter Institute.\n\nIn a statement, the Times said the opinion section frequently runs excerpts of books produced by the newspaper\u2019s reporters. The new accusations were uncovered during the authors\u2019 reporting process for the book, which is why they had not appeared in the newspaper before.\n\nStill, this doesn\u2019t explain why the new accusations weren\u2019t pointed out to editors and given more prominence in news pages. Todd Gitlin, a Columbia University journalism professor, suggested bureaucratic inertia might partly explain it \u2014 since it had been determined that the piece would run in the opinion section, no one stepped forward to question that.\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of decisions on this that strike me as dubious,\u201d Gitlin said in an interview.\n\nTrump, not unexpectedly, was harsher. He said his Supreme Court appointee was \u201cthe one who is actually being assaulted ... by lies and fake news.\u201d The White House also distributed a copy of a New York Post editorial headlined, \u201cThe latest Times hit on Brett Kavanaugh is a clear miss.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many stories are wrong? Almost all of the stories the New York Times has done are inaccurate and wrong,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet Monday.\n\nTrump said Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. Yet Roy Gutterman, a journalism professor at Syracuse University and director of the Tully Center for Free Speech, said the Justice Department has nothing to do with the case, and a libel case would be tough.\n\n\u201cGiven the developing nature of the allegations and the sourcing of the story, coupled with the correction, it still does not appear to rise to anything that would be actionable under libel law,\u201d Gutterman said.\n\nThe Times also apologized for an offensive tweet sent out by the opinion section advertising its initial story. The tweet said: \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn\u2019t belong at Yale University in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe Times deleted the tweet and said it was \u201cclearly inappropriate and offensive\u201d and was looking into how it was sent.\n\nShares of the New York Times Co.
