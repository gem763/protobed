(AP) - As fans of the human variety crowded into Neyland Stadium to watch the University of Tennessee play Georgia, one special critter got a front row seat. Sinan the squirrel sat back in his own squirrel-sized chair to catch all the action.\n\nWe have a lot of questions, but none of them matter. It\u2019s a squirrel in a UT football helmet, and we\u2019re all for it.\n\nSinan is the team\u2019s biggest (and smallest) fan. His love for the Vols all started when his owner and rescuer, Saed Awad, took him fishing at a marina in Oak Ridge.\n\nSinan was only a few months old when Awad, who lives in Oak Ridge, saw UT rowers practicing in the water. Since rowers scared away the fish, Sinan just sat on Awad\u2019s shoulder to watch. It didn\u2019t take long for the rowers to notice.\n\nSoon, Awad was getting messages from the rowers, asking him to bring Sinan to their events. At the next race, Awad showed up with Sinan in hand. This time, Sinan was sporting a tiny UT hat that Awad had found for him.\n\n\u201cEveryone went crazy,\u201d Awad said. \u201cThat\u2019s when it became a UT thing.\u201d\n\nSinan continued repping the UT rowing team until football season arrived. Awad was hoping to get some photos of Sinan perched on one of the campus Smokey statues before the season started, so he traveled to campus on what he thought was going to be a quiet Sunday - only it wasn\u2019t.\n\nAwad accidentally traveled to Neyland during Fan Day practice. Sinan didn\u2019t have his signature UT helmet yet, so Awad made do with an orange peel and a Power T sticker.\n\nBefore the storm hit and the practice was cancelled, Awad and Sinan met many fans and a local television reporter who did the first story on Sinan. After that, Sinan\u2019s stardom skyrocketed.\n\nSinan\u2019s likeness was painted on The Rock, Awad started selling Sinan game day buttons and they both met another UT-loving animal, Smokey.\n\nOther local and out-of-state teams have reached out to Awad, asking if Sinan would wear some of their gear if they sent it to him.\n\n\u201cI tell them \u2018No, he already has a team,\u2019\u201d Awad said.\n\nSinan has taken countless photos with followers around Knoxville.\n\n\u201cThe thing I love most about Sinan is how he makes kids smile. \u2026 Seeing people smile is like happiness,\u201d Awad said. \u201cWhen I made the (Instagram) page, I just made it because there\u2019s so much bad on the internet. People complain and argue about everything, so I just want to make a space without drama.\u201d\n\nAwad also is passionate about giving back. He donates a portion of the profits from Sinan\u2019s game day buttons to a local animal shelter and is working on several other Sinan-inspired projects, including a calendar and children\u2019s book that could help cancer research efforts.\n\nFor now, Awad and Sinan are inseparable friends, but Awad said that even if Sinan runs away one day, he\u2019ll be happy that he\u2019s living the life he wants to live.\n\n\u201cIf he decided to go now, I\u2019m not going to hold him,\u201d Awad said. \u201cIt\u2019s his life. That\u2019s why I saved him.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As fans of the human variety crowded into Neyland Stadium to watch the University of Tennessee play Georgia, one special critter got a front row seat.
