Allen scolded Alex Whipple for the \u201cincomprehensible\u201d terror he inflicted on Elizabeth \u201cLizzy\u201d Shelley, her family and the community.\n\n\u201cYou will never see the light of day. You will never breathe fresh air again,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWhat you did was so abhorrent and vile that you must spend the rest of your life in prison.\u201d\n\nSAN FRANCISCO HOMELESS CRISIS PROMPTS NEIGHBORHOOD TO PUT BOULDERS ON SIDEWALK TO DETER CAMPERS\n\nLizzy\u2019s disappearance in May triggered a massive search and widespread concern in the picturesque mountain valley community of Logan.\n\n\u201cHow could someone do this to their own niece?\u201d said Dejay Smith, Lizzy\u2019s uncle. \u201cI would hope to never see a monster like him walk through this community again.\u201d\n\nThen Smith turned around and spoke directly to Whipple.\n\n\u201cThere are few things that are more vile than your actions,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou are the worst kind of person humanity has to offer.\u201d\n\nAnother uncle, Zachary Black, also spoke directly to Whipple, who sat only a few feet away.\n\n\u201cYou are filth,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you spend the rest of your life in a tiny box.\u201d\n\nThe 22-year-old Whipple declined to speak, hung his head and showed no emotion during the hearing.\n\nHe pleaded guilty last month to murder, kidnapping and sexual assault as part of an agreement that dismissed charges of obstruction of justice and desecration of a body, as Fox 13 News reported. Whipple's attorney, Shannon Demler, said his client was raised in an \"imperfect\" family, was physically abused as a child and developed mental health and substance abuse issues while homeless. He added that Whipple knew he committed a horrible act and was ready to accept his punishment.\n\nPolice say Whipple killed Lizzy on May 25 after his sister let him spend the night at the family home. Authorities have said they found the girl\u2019s blood on Whipple\u2019s clothing, and a bloody, broken knife from the family\u2019s kitchen near where the body was hidden.\n\nLizzy was missing for five days before Whipple told police where to find the child\u2019s body \u2014 in the woods less than a block from her house \u2014 after prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty.\n\nRelatives remembered Lizzy as a sweet, happy little girl who loved drawing, being outdoors and rainbow-colored butterflies. A poster board with pictures of Lizzy and rainbow-colored butterflies was placed on an easel in the front of the courtroom. A victim advocate who worked with the family brought a pair of rainbow-colored tennis shoes Lizzy was excited to wear to kindergarten.\n\nCache County Attorney James Swink called Whipple\u2019s crime a \u201cvicious\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d act that made the community feel \u201ca little less safe, a little more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLizzy\u2019s mother, Jessica Black, didn\u2019t come to court because she said she couldn\u2019t bear being in the same room as her brother, but she spoke to reporters afterward and released butterflies to remember her daughter.\n\nShe called it a difficult day, but thanked the community for their support.\n\n\u201cI would give anything to be reunited with her, to hug her and hold her one more time,\u201d she said, crying. \u201cOur lives will never be the same. We will never forget our sweet girl and the happiness and sunshine she brought us.\u201d\n\nClick for more from Fox 13 News.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Utah man who pleaded guilty to killing and sexually assaulting his 5-year-old niece was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole Tuesday during an emotional hearing where the girl\u2019s relatives called him a \u201cmonster\u201d who savagely took the life of an innocent child.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
