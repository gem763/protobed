(Courtesy of Jonathan Martinis)\n\nThat last loss would have hit her particularly hard because she has long been a devout Republican. She has volunteered with local campaigns and speaks about George W. Bush as if he were a family friend.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about Trump,\u201d Hatch tells me when I call her on a recent afternoon. \u201cHe\u2019s not a good person. And I just found out that Joe Biden is running for president. He cares about people with disabilities.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t call Hatch to talk about politics. It just happens to be one of her favorite subjects. I called her to find out how she was feeling about her latest role: published author.\n\nSix years ago, her Virginia court case opened the way for others with disabilities to fight for their independence. Hatch challenged a guardianship request by her parents that would have allowed them to keep her in a group home, and away from the friends she wanted to live with and the job she wanted to hold. Her attorneys argued at the time that she didn\u2019t need someone to make every decision for her. She simply needed support making decisions.\n\n[Virginia woman with Down syndrome seeks power to live the way she wants]\n\n\n\nJenny Hatch, who has Down syndrome, wrote this for a book that aims to help people with disabilities keep their independence. (Courtesy of Jonathan Martinis)\n\nWhen Hatch won her case, she became an immediate champion for disability rights. She also became a reminder of what\u2019s possible when people are judged by what they can do instead of what they can\u2019t.\n\nIn the years since, she has delivered speeches that have brought audiences to their feet. She has watched an initiative in her name, The Jenny Hatch Justice Project, fight to get others out from under guardianship.\n\nAnd now, she has written the foreword of a book that aims to help people with disabilities across the country live as independently as possible.\n\n\u201cJenny\u2019s story should be the beginning of the story,\u201d says Jonathan Martinis, who was Hatch\u2019s attorney in her guardianship case. He authored the book along with Peter Blanck, who served as an expert witness in her case.\n\n\u201cWhen I met Jenny, she was under a guardianship order,\u201d Martinis says. \u201cShe was living in a group home she didn\u2019t want to live in. She wasn\u2019t allowed to go to her church. She wasn\u2019t allowed to go to work. Her laptop was taken away. Her phone was taken away. If you wanted to see Jenny, you had to fill out a permission slip. You had to say when you wanted to see her and what you would do, and you couldn\u2019t talk about her guardianship.\u201d\n\nAn ax murderer would have automatically been given the right to talk to an attorney, he says, but he had to request permission from a judge to discuss her case with her.\n\nWhen the judge finally ruled in Hatch\u2019s favor, granting a one-year temporary guardianship to the friends she wanted to live with, Martinis celebrated the victory and predicted more to come: \u201cFor anyone who has been told you can\u2019t do something, you can\u2019t make your own decisions, I give you Jenny Hatch \u2014 the rock that starts the avalanche.\u201d\n\nSince then, he says, 10 states have passed laws recognizing supported decision-making as a preferred alternative to guardianship, projects centered around the issue have taken hold in about 40 states and more court wins have followed. In D.C. last year, an 87-year-old woman became the first senior citizen in the city to convince a court to terminate guardianship in favor of supported decision-making.\n\n[This 87-year-old D.C. woman just made it easier for you to keep your independence]\n\nAt the same time, Martinis notes, the number of people under guardianship has tripled since 1994, and because schools remain the number one referral source, the most common age for people to fall under it is 18.\n\n\u201cWithout choice, we don\u2019t have rights,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities who have lost their rights.\u201d\n\nMartinis says the purpose of the book is to give people an easy-to-follow guide so they know how to find the support they need to maintain their independence. The title is, \u201cSupported Decision-Making: From Justice for Jenny to Justice for All!\u201d\n\nKelly Morris, the friend who took in Hatch when she won her case, says she and her husband, Jim Talbert, didn\u2019t fully know what they were jumping into at the time. Hatch had worked at their thrift shop and they took her into their home after she was injured in a bike accident. When her parents later placed her in the group home, they knew she was unhappy, so they decided to help her fight the guardianship.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even recognize what we were doing,\u201d Morris says. \u201cAnd now looking back, I\u2019m not a religious person, I\u2019m more spiritual, but it was all divine intervention from everybody we met to how the process took place.\u201d\n\nThey have now opened a third thrift shop and Hatch helps at the different locations. She still lives with them and has grown close to Morris\u2019s daughter, Jordan, who is 21 and has cerebral palsy. Hatch is no longer under guardianship and Morris says they have talked about moving her into an apartment or building a small house for her on their property, so she can remain close and still have her own space.\n\n\u201cI would love to see her married and have her own life,\u201d Morris says.\n\nWhen I ask Hatch how she is doing, she repeats several times, \u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so happy that I get to be with my friends that I care about,\u201d she says, her voice suddenly shaking. \u201cI love Kelly and Jim so much. I don\u2019t know what I would do without my friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you crying?\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy tears,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m happy that I won my case. I don\u2019t know what I would do without Jonathan.\u201d\n\nShe hasn\u2019t yet seen the book, which was just published this week, but she says she\u2019s excited for her copy to arrive.\n\nMartinis says after he asked her if she wanted to write the opening section, he found a handwritten letter from her in his mailbox. It is now the foreword in the book.\n\nIn it, Hatch writes that she hopes her story helps others and that \u201cwe all deserve to live a life that makes us happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I have help to make decisions I can handle anything that is my mind-set,\u201d she writes. \u201cI choose when I get to go get my nails done or go to the mall or go to the movies. I can go to a restaurant and choose what to eat. These are decisions that most people make every day. I will never forget what Jonathan and my friends Jim and Kelly have done for me and that makes me feel like a real person.\u201d", "description": "Jenny Hatch, who has Down syndrome, was 29 when she fought against a guardianship request by her parents \u2014 and won.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities.", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8189WCSNLxbWDkay5K02zZRYqDo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/567E7LH3WYI6FCPXQWM6H532M4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
