But we have no deal to announce today, and for that I am terribly disappointed,\u201d Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said, at a news conference on Sunday night, according to CBS Chicago.\n\nSTUDENTS OF STRIKING CHICAGO TEACHERS BARRED FROM TRACK MEET\n\n\"This is, by any estimation, and incredible offer \u2013 and despite all of this, the CTU has not accepted it,\" Lightfoot said. \"We are enormously disappointed that CTU simply cannot take yes for an answer.\"\n\nBut, in a news conference Sunday night, CTU vice president Stacy Davis Gates said that the city had not met the union's demands. The union wants a three-year contract; the city is offering a five-year contract. The union wants librarians in every school. And the union contends that the city's class-size promises would only impact one-third of students instead of all of them. The union also says the two sides are far apart on how much money should be apportioned to special education needs.\n\nUAW LOOKS TO FORD NOW THAT GM DEAL IS DONE\n\n\"A fraction of 1 percent of the annual CPS budget stands between us and an agreement,\" CTU tweeted. \"A number of demands would cost the district virtually nothing. At this point, everyone is suffering but the person who could actually make a difference: the mayor.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe union for more than 7,500 school support staff members -- who had gone on strike along with the teachers' union -- did reach its own deal on Sunday night.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Chicago Public Schools said it had made a $500 million offer, but the union said the two sides are still $38 million apart.", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AP19296596404331.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
