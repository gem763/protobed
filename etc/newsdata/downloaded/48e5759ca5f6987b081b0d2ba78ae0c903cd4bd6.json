This is standard and is usually followed by a decline as people grow more optimistic about the economy during an expansion and spend more.\n\nHowever, the personal-saving rate continued to rise to an average of 8.2% in the first 7 months of 2019 \u2014 despite U.S. consumers experiencing historic levels of confidence in the economy.\n\nIn total, savings outpaced spending and investing in 2018.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"That is evidence to suggest that something structural has changed, and it\u2019s made the saving rate kind of sticky at higher levels,\u201d Tiffany Wilding, a U.S. economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., told the WSJ.\n\nHow it works: Some economists believe that today's high saving rate was influenced by the 2017 tax cuts passed by President Trump. Economists can't tell who's saving, as the latest saving data is not broken down by income, but they assume that the recent saving rate rise is likely being driven by the wealthy.\n\nThe tax cuts boosted many wealthy Americans' after-tax income, but possibly not enough to change their spending habits. As a result, they started saving more.\n\nOthers think the higher rate is the result of Americans who lived through the Great Recession \u2014 and were scarred by it \u2014 preparing for the next market crash. Another possible explanation is baby boomers preparing for retirement.\n\nGo deeper: The end of money as we know it", "description": "Economists think that if the saving rate surpasses investments for several years, it could hinder economic growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/NfoDjgjK7ZjeCpMlEIK8gZLgW90=/0x454:6240x3964/1920x1080/2019/09/22/1569178187348.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
