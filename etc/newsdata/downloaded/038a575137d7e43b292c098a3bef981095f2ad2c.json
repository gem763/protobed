The special material has millions of tiny holes in the membrane layer that allow heat and sweat to escape while keeping water completely out. When we tested them, we found this material construction to be exceptionally effective.\n\nAlthough Vessi is a newcomer in the sneaker industry, its performance and versatility make it a very good option for people in need of sneakers, especially those who live a busy life on the go. The sneaker's light weight and comfort are great for those who are adventurous, but if you're venturing into more treacherous terrain, you'll probably want a shoe with a rugged outsole. Most of the Cityscape's outsole is made of EVA (which isn't as grippy as rubber) with two rubber strips in the midfoot and a rubber section on the heel for traction. I also found them to be a bit hard to put on because there's no heel pull tab \u2014 a small but useful feature found on most sock-like sneakers.\n\nAll in all, the Vessi is a superior option with its 100% waterproof material. Whether you're running on a beach, traversing a shallow stream, or simply protecting your feet on a rainy day, the Vessi Cityscape\u2014 and all of their other styles \u2014 will keep your feet dry under just about every circumstance.\n\nPros: Completely waterproof, lightweight, breathable, easy to pack\n\nCons: More durable sneakers available, minimal traction, hard to put on", "description": "Rainy weather doesn't have to get in the way of your affinity for sneakers.
