Langley Park is served by multiple frequent bus routes, which are some of the busiest in the D.C. area\u2019s MetroBus network, with two of the routes serving the area seeing over 12,000 riders on an average weekday. While transit service in Langley Park is decent, it is often inadequate, with buses being crowded at all hours of the day and even on weekends. Langley Park is served solely by buses at present, since the nearest Metrorail station is a couple miles away. However, a proposed light rail line called the Purple Line promises to provide a much needed mobility enhancement for the tens of thousands of working class residents in the area. However, the fate of that project is up in the air due to a recent court decision.", "description": "Langley Park\u2019s auto-oriented development pattern imposes unneeded costs and \r\nburdens upon those who can least afford them.", "authors": ["Sean Emerson"], "top_image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53dd6676e4b0fedfbc26ea91/54b6c509e4b062126976d942/57b61e962994caeb7b1d794a/1529597440680/IMG_9200+copy.jpg?format=1500w", "published_at": "2016-08-18"}
