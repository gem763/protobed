Also, firefighters who attended had not had training on how best to deal with a cladding fire, Sir Martin Moore-Bick's inquiry finds.\n\nBut there is praise for the courage of the firefighters.\n\nSeventy-two people died in the fire, on 14 June 2017. Sir Martin's 1,000-page report will be published on Wednesday, but the BBC has seen it in advance. Here are the details.\n\nThe BBC also looks at what happened on the night of the fire. And we remember the victims.\n\nJohnson to make another December election bid\n\nBoris Johnson failed to get his plans for a 12 December election through the Commons on Monday, but the prime minister will try again later, via a different parliamentary route. Under the rules, his motion required two-thirds of MPs to support it - unfeasible with Labour opposing it. So, instead, he will today submit a parliamentary bill, needing a simple majority of MPs' backing.\n\nThat means Mr Johnson will still have to get the SNP and the Liberal Democrats to side with him. It looks set to be another lively and interesting day in Parliament. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg gives her take on things.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU has granted a Brexit delay until 31 January (or earlier if Parliament backs the PM's deal with the EU before then). But is this the last such extension? BBC Europe editor Katya Adler gauges the mood.\n\nPlus, see how your MP voted on Monday.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nCalifornia fires: Thousands of homes evacuated\n\nA fast-moving wildfire that started on Monday has forced the evacuation of several thousand homes in Los Angeles. California's governor has declared a state of emergency, as power supplies are disrupted. Fires are also raging in northern California, with roads around Santa Rosa, north of San Francisco, filled with cars as people attempt to flee.\n\n\"If you are in an evacuation zone, don't screw around,\" tweeted former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, among those who have left their homes. \"Get out.\"\n\nIs climate change to blame for these and other recent fires? We look at the evidence.\n\nIs it OK if someone wants to live for years on a bench?\n\nBy Tom de Castella\n\nA large bulky object wrapped in a bright blue tarpaulin. It is sitting in the middle of the pavement. It could be an old piano, maintenance equipment, a delivery waiting to be unpacked. But then the tarpaulin starts to move, an arm appears and the cover is pulled back to reveal a man and a woman, swaddled in blankets sitting on a bench.\n\nThey have been living on this bench on a busy London street for more than four years. By day they sit there watching the world go by. At night they pull the cover over and sleep. The bench has become their home.\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nThe newspapers deal in detail with the wrangling in Parliament over a possible December election. The Daily Mail promises a \"dramatic final push\" for one by the PM later today, while the Financial Times says this means Brexit deal discussions have been put \"on ice\". And the Times reports that a \"squabble\" over the exact date could thwart the entire plan. Elsewhere, the Daily Mirror leads on the \"shame\" of Labour MP Keith Vaz, who faces a possible Commons suspension after its standards body found \"compelling evidence\" he offered to pay for a class A drug and had paid-for sex in August 2016.\n\nDaily digest\n\nShark attack Two British men injured at Queensland tourist spot\n\nBrain illness Tick-borne encephalitis virus has reached UK\n\nTrump impeachment Democrats plan first formal vote this week\n\nNarcissists They may be unpleasant, but are they happy?\n\nIf you watch one thing today\n\nIbiza: One season too many?\n\nIf you listen to one thing today\n\nThe cult of King Tut\n\nIf you read one thing today\n\nImage copyright Amanda Mancino-Williams\n\nWhen reserving a train seat goes wrong\n\nSign up for a morning briefing direct to your phone\n\nLookahead\n\n09:05 The UK team for the Invictus Games in The Hague, the Netherlands, next year, gather for the first time in London.\n\n19:45 Haringey's FA Cup fourth qualifying round tie with Yeovil, abandoned earlier this month amid reports of racial abuse, is replayed.\n\nOn this day\n\n1998 The report by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission accuses leading political figures of human rights violations.\n\nFrom elsewhere\n\nHow our brains remember things depends upon how we learn them (Oxford University)\n\nWhy we can't tell the truth about ageing (New Yorker)\n\nThirty years later: Where the Berlin Wall once stood (Daily Mail)\n\nLondon's tiniest attractions (Daily Telegraph)", "description": "Your morning briefing for 29 October 2019.", "authors": ["Justin Parkinson", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17F56/production/_109443189_9b1e8fd0-4ebc-4de1-90e4-196ab2c961d6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
