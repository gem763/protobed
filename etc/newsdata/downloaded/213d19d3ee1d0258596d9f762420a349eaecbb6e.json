This child is not property. I am appalled.\u201d\n\nShe later hailed the police investigation, saying: \"Friends, This is an example of what happens when we speak up, when we record incidents of police abuse, and when we demand justice.\n\n\"This is a good starting point for disrupting business as usual. Thanks to Helen Dillman for recording the incident and documenting what she witnessed.\"\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nPolice said police had tried to stop the girl at a Midway BP station earlier in the day, an area identified as a crime hotspot.\n\nThey say she violated a no-trespassing order and ran from police.\n\nAnd in the struggle later, the officers claim she scratched and punched one of them in the head.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nIn a press conference on Thursday, the young girl's mum, Davida Conover, claimed her daughter has mental health problems and the officers have had several previous encounters with her and were too aggressive on this occassion.\n\n\u201cShe was basically treated like an animal,\u201d she said.\n\nOfficers Alexander Graham, Grady Sheehy and Charles Busch are each the subject of an internal affairs investigation, the Star Tribune reports.\n\nSt. Paul Police Federation President Paul Kuntz said: \u201cI think they used the minimal amount of force that they possibly could to get her under control.\n\n\u201cThere were no punches.
