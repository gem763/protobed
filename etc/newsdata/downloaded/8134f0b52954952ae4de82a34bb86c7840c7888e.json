This hurricane will totally destroy this island.\u201d\n\nThe terrible consequences were visible from the first helicopter overflights of Abaco and Grand Bahama islands on Tuesday. Video footage showed lakes of seawater instead of streets, blasted debris where homes once stood, boats thrown inland like discarded bath toys, denuded trees and the occasional lone structure still standing. In many areas, life on the islands appeared to have simply been erased.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s total devastation. It\u2019s decimated. Apocalyptic. It looks like a bomb went off,\u201d Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a local hurricane relief organization, told the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Volunteers walk under the wind and rain on a flooded road after rescuing several families that arrived on small boats, in Freeport, Grand Bahama, on Tuesday.

The main Freeport hospital was likewise flooded, and an estimated 13,000 homes destroyed.\n\nFlooding drove residents on to roofs, water lapping over second-story windowsills and water driving against shuddering glass. There was waist-deep water in the streets and higher, which residents were struggling to swim or wade through to safety.\n\nFreeport is about 70 miles east of West Palm Beach, Florida, and is a popular cruise ship and tourist destination boasting upwards of 1 million visitors a year.\n\n\u201cThe #Bahamas needs our help,\u201d Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, Florida, tweeted on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOur prayers are with our Bahamian friends as they confront the aftermath of Hurricane #Dorian,\u201d tweeted the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. The USAID relief agency put out a call for \u201curgently-needed humanitarian assistance\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rising waters cover cars on a road in Freeport on Tuesday.

Marvin Dames, the Bahamas\u2019 minister of national security, said that more casualties were expected.\n\n\u201cThis was a crisis of epic proportions,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe reality of it all is, unfortunately, we will see more deaths. I can\u2019t see any way out of it.\u201d\n\nOne radio station said it had received more than 2,000 distress messages, the Associated Press reported, including reports of a five-month-old baby stranded on a roof and a woman with six grandchildren who cut a hole in a roof to escape rising floodwaters. At least two designated storm shelters flooded.\n\nQueen Elizabeth sent a message of support for the country, which gained independence in 1973.\n\n\u201cAt this very difficult time, my thoughts and prayers are with those who have seen their homes and property destroyed, and I also send my gratitude to the emergency services and volunteers who are supporting the rescue and recovery effort,\u201d the message said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest US coast guard personnel wheel an evacuee on a stretcher, rescued from Abaco Island after Hurricane Dorian, in Nassau.

UN officials said more than 60,000 people on the hard-hit islands will need food, and the Red Cross said some 62,000 will need clean drinking water.\n\n\u201cWhat we are hearing lends credence to the fact that this has been a catastrophic storm and a catastrophic impact,\u201d Cochrane said.\n\nLawson Bates, a staffer for Arkansas-based MedicCorps, flew over Abaco and said: \u201cIt looks completely flattened. There\u2019s boats way inland that are flipped over. It\u2019s total devastation.\u201d\n\nThe storm caused flooding on other Bahamian islands as well, including in the capital of Nassau.\n\nThe US coast guard, USAID relief agency and UN relief agencies joined efforts led by the Royal Bahamas Defense Force and the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) of the Bahamas.\n\nThe US embassy in Nassau advised those in need of urgent assistance to call Nema at 322-6731 and send their locations to +1 (242) 557-5202 via WhatsApp. Officials advised those outside the Bahamas wishing to provide assistance to visit the Center for International Disaster Information.\n\nSpeaking on a cellphone video shot from the heart of the disaster, the Bahamian member of parliament Iram Lewis sent a plea for assistance.\n\n\u201cWe are going to need a lot, a lot of support after this hurricane is over.\u201d\n\nAgencies contributed reporting", "description": "Thousands left without shelter and likely to face food and water shortages as Bahamas hurricane tracks towards Florida", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab318ed1b168ba1c748ad4ce4b2a0b18115aaa41/0_37_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=298d91c554ecda34ad4d0183ae3fa7f3"}
