Subsequent reports on Sunday indicated that as many as 24 other infants are in \u201ccritical condition\u201d after similar doctor\u2019s visits.\n\nOn Monday, Cuban \u201cPresident\u201d Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel accused outlets covering her death of \u201cpolitical manipulation\u201d against the communist regime.\n\nDiario de Cuba, a Spanish newspaper, first circulated the distraught social media messages posted by Yaima Caballero, Dominguez\u2019s mother, accusing the Cuban state of \u201ckilling\u201d her daughter. The post was translated into English by the Cuban interest website Babal\u00fa Blog.\n\nDiario de Cuba first reported that two infants died, though the second has not been publicly identified, and another 24 are in critical condition. All reportedly visited the Betancourt Neninger government clinic for routine wellness visits before falling ill.\n\n\u201cOn the left is how I took her to get her vaccines, and on the right how they returned her to me,\u201d Caballero wrote on Instagram, with before-and-after photos of Paloma. \u201cAnd the vaccine according to them was against all diseases \u2026 they killed her and I have to be ok with that???\u201d:\n\nThe report confirmed that the girl did not survive more than 72 hours following her doctors\u2019 visit.\n\nThe official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, Granma, published a statement from Cuba\u2019s Public Health Ministry confirming Dominguez\u2019s death and four other children experiencing \u201cadverse\u201d effects after receiving the same vaccine as Dominguez. The children were scheduled to receive the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. All reportedly received the immunization between October 7 and 8 at the Betancourt Neninge clinic. Dominguez died on October 9.\n\nThe ministry confirmed the vaccines used were imported from India and did not offer any explanation for what happened to the children, stating only that an \u201cactive investigation\u201d was underway. It offered no details on what \u201csymptoms\u201d the children experienced or what Dominguez\u2019s cause of death was.\n\nIt noted that the World Health Organization (WHO) certifies the vaccine.\n\nThe WHO has helped the Cuban regime market the alleged advances of its healthcare system around the world.\n\n\u201cCuba is the only country that has a healthcare system closely linked to research and development. This is the way to go, because human health can only improve through innovation,\u201d former WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said during a visit to Cuba in 2014.\n\nThe regional Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) helped Cuba sign a deal with Brazil to create the \u201cMais M\u00e9dicos\u201d program, a plan to flood Brazil with Cuban slave doctors, paid a living \u201cstipend\u201d that survivors of the program have said was not enough to cover food. After the doctors sued for the salaries they were promised when traveling to Brazil, an investigation revealed that adding PAHO as a signatory to the deal made it possible for the then-socialist Brazilian government to override the constitutional obligation to present the deal \u2013 technically a treaty with a foreign state \u2013 to Congress. Conservative President Jair Bolsonaro ended Mais M\u00e9dicos this year.\n\nFollowing the Public Health Ministry\u2019s statement, Caballero, Dominguez\u2019s mother, posted online that this was the first she had heard from the ministry, as she had not been contacted directly.\n\n\u201cGood for them, they now look good in front of the people. And what about my husband and I?\u201d she asked.\n\nOn Monday, D\u00edaz-Canel, dictator Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s second-in-command, posted a message warning critics of the regime against \u201cpolitical manipulation\u201d in response to Dominguez\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cPainful loss of baby Paloma. Condolences to her parents,\u201d he wrote. \u201c[Public Health Ministry] is investigating and is closely caring for the other affected children. The political manipulation of adversaries is offensive and lamentable. Nothing is more important for the Cuban Revolution than a child\u201d:\n\nDolorosa p\u00e9rdida de beb\u00e9 Paloma. Condolencias a sus padres. #MINSAP investiga y cuida celosamente a otros ni\u00f1os afectados. Ofende y lastima manipulaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de adversarios. Nada m\u00e1s importante que un ni\u00f1o para la #Revoluci\u00f3nCubana. #SomosCuba \u2014 Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez (@DiazCanelB) October 14, 2019\n\nOn July 13, 1994, the Cuban communist regime sunk a tugboat full of would-be refugees attempting to flee to America, killing 41 people, including ten children. The youngest victim, Helen Mart\u00ednez Enr\u00edquez, was six months old.\n\nCaballero posted on Monday that a Cuban government medical professional finally reached out to her, but offered no new information on what killed the baby.\n\n\u201cThe national director of the Maternal-Children\u2019s Care Program (PAMI), through a phone call he gave us to extend his condolences \u2026 informed me and 100 percent confirmed that the cause of death of my little girl was not the MMR vaccine, but something that happened in the Betancourt Neninger government clinic,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe vaccine was used nationwide and had no similar consequences. He left very clear they are investigating the consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo in the end it was the clinic\u2019s negligence?\u201d she asked. \u201cI say this because many say it is not Cuba\u2019s fault since the vaccine came from India. In the end we know it will be nobody\u2019s fault, the causes will simply appear, but no one will be guilty\u201d:\n\nCuban healthcare authorities began warning of a \u201ccomplex situation\u201d in July, as medical supplies nationwide began running out. Cuba, as a communist state, is dependent on a parasitic relationship with a larger state to survive. It survived for two decades on such a relationship with Venezuela, but as that socialist regime turned the oil-rich nation into a failed state, Cubans have suffered intense shortages of basic food, medicine, and goods. Cuba was experiencing shortages of as many as 44 key basic medications in July, including drugs for common conditions such as high blood pressure and anxiety.\n\nCuba\u2019s collapsing healthcare system has received praise from a wide variety of famous American leftists, including but not limited to Michael Moore \u2013 who directed a film praising the communist regime\u2019s health treatments \u2013 to Danny Glover and Tom Morello. It has also received praise from mainstream media outlets such as CNN and the New York Times.", "description": "Paloma Dominguez Caballero, 1, died last week less than three days after receiving her scheduled 12-month vaccinations from a clinic in Cuba.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/young-girl-cuba-hospital-died-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
