REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo\n\nThe pound closed just below the $1.30 mark on Friday, right at the peak of a 6.5% surge it has enjoyed since British Prime Minister Boris Johnson first made a breakthrough on striking an EU divorce deal on Oct. 10.\n\nThe currency strengthened as Johnson agreed a revised deal at an EU summit on Thursday, but parliament frustrated his plans on Saturday by withholding its approval until formal ratification legislation is passed.\n\nWhile the British government still insists the country will leave the bloc come Oct. 31, the consensus view is that a no-deal Brexit by default will be avoided.\n\nFor Timothy Graf, strategist at U.S. asset manager State Street, last week\u2019s rally in the pound may have been \u201ca little bit overbought\u201d, but Saturday\u2019s vote in the House of Commons implies a no-deal departure is now unlikely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a positive in the sense that we have avoided the worst outcome\u201d, he said.\n\nKallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg, made a similar case.\n\n\u201cI would not be selling on Monday morning on the basis of the news over the weekend,\u201d he said.\n\nDOUSING THE EUPHORIA\n\nFor many, Sunday and Monday\u2019s opening trades will merely knock some of the froth off the recent surge as investors await the outcome of a possible vote on the deal itself on Monday.\n\n\u201cClearly, for sterling any setback is negative in the short term, but don\u2019t write off Johnson just yet,\u201d cautioned Societe Generale\u2019s chief UK economist Brian Hilliard.\n\nOn Saturday Deutsche Bank strategist Oliver Harvey said his bank retained a \u201cconstructive outlook on the UK\u201d and a positive view on the pound.\n\n\u201cThe only remaining tail risk is that EU27 leaders do not agree to an extension (which seems unlikely) or that in a subsequent election the no-deal Brexit Party performs sufficiently strongly to enter government,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nPeter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum, said there is a possibility that the opening of the markets could prove somewhat uneventful, given the lack of visibility.\n\nInvestors who built positions on the pound and UK stocks expecting a favourable outcome had little reason to change their minds.\n\nBut for David Page, a senior economist at Axa IM, there has been a change in sentiment since Friday evening.\n\n\u201cFinancial markets closed last week on an optimistic tone with hopes of resolution and certainty to the Brexit outlook. These hopes have been dashed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGains in sterling, mid-cap equities and UK gilt yields look likely to face an early retracement over the coming week.\u201d\n\nIn London, investment banks were ready to implement special measures to ensure that they and their clients could tackle a potential volatility surge on Sunday evening, with additional staff on trading desks.\n\n\u201cWe will have the resources in place to provide a 24-hour service to our clients across all the key markets to which we usually provide access,\u201d an HSBC spokesman said.\n\nRussell Lascala, head of foreign exchange trading at Deutsche Bank, said his team wasn\u2019t expecting a dramatic session of trading and that plans to call in 20 additional people had been abandoned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see much when the market opens later on Sunday,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokeswoman at Citi said on Friday that the bank would be hosting a conference call with former foreign minister William Hague to help its clients to analyse the country\u2019s political situation.\n\nSee also:\n\nBrexit nod from parliament to unleash 4% rally in pound, send UK plc to record high\n\nGRAPHIC-Seismograph: Brexit-sensitive financial prices in critical week\n\nBankers brace for no-deal Brexit markets mayhem 10 days early\n\nBrexit will happen on Oct. 31 despite PM\u2019s unsigned delay request, UK says", "description": "Britain's latest Brexit stumble is likely to prompt a pullback in sterling's recent rally when trading resumes later on Sunday, though strategists say rising confidence that a disorderly European Union exit will be avoided should limit any sell-off.", "authors": ["Julien Ponthus", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443046135&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0JG", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
