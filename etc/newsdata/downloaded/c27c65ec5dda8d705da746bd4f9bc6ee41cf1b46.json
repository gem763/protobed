Abundant evidence speaks of a connection, at least ideological and, perhaps, more tangible than that, between the young right-wing radical in Halle and others like him who previously carried out mass murders at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, mosques in New Zealand and a Walmart in El Paso. According to statements the Halle perpetrator made before and during his live-streamed deeds, immigration and feminism were imperiling the white race, and \u201cthe root of all these problems is the Jew.\u201d \u201cIf I fail and die but kill a single Jew, it was worth it,\u201d the attacker wrote in a manifesto first reported by the International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence, a research organization at King\u2019s College London. \u201cAfter all, if every White Man kills just one, we win.\u201d\n\nIn short, the world\u2019s democracies now face not only populist political movements that traffic in racial and anti-immigrant demagoguery, whether in the form of President Trump\u2019s worst rhetoric, or that of Germany\u2019s Trumpists, the Alternative for Germany party. Beyond the realm of electoral politics, there is an international, Internet-savvy threat from ultra-right-wing, white-supremacist and anti-Semitic terrorists, inspired in part, apparently, by Anders Breivik, the Norwegian self-described fascist who slaughtered 77 people in 2011. Whether copycats or conspirators, they are as indifferent to their own survival as any Islamist suicide bomber, as hostile to Western values of freedom \u2014 and as bent on maximum propaganda impact. This threat has festered while Middle East-based terrorist groups have been, understandably, the focus of U.S. and allied security agencies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVigilance in that direction must continue; but it is past time to devote similar resources and attention to the apparent enemy within, as the Department of Homeland Security, to its credit, has recently pledged to do. Germany\u2019s politicians, stunned for obvious historical reasons by the fact that one of their nation\u2019s young people would attempt such a crime \u2014 having first gone online to spout Holocaust denial \u2014 have responded with unanimous denunciations of not only the crime in Halle but also the mind-set behind it. What remains for them, and for us, is to match words with deeds.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "German and U.S. security agencies should devote resources to fighting white supremacists.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Gqap4-rOSiLff9GcpPU2qhl06u4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G4SHTDHLT4I6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
