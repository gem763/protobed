Ants had swarmed him, leaving more than one hundred bites, and the facility never even bothered to inform her of the problem. Marrable died shortly afterward, a death Ross feels was hastened by the ant attack.\n\nYesterday, the VA announced a major (if temporary) shakeup after WSB-TV aired this segment over the weekend:\n\nChannel 2 investigative reporter Aaron Diamant spoke with a woman last week who said her father was bitten 100 plus times by ants before his death at the VA Medical Center\u2019s Eagles\u2019 Nest Community Living Center in Atlanta. On Tuesday, the VA announced that the regional director was placed on administrative leave, and several other employees were moved to different positions in response to what happened. They are also planning to retrain all VA personnel involved in reporting urgent issues. \u201cWhat happened at Eagles\u2019 Nest was unacceptable, and we want to ensure that Veterans and families know we are determined to restore their trust in the facility,\u201d Dr. Richard Stone,VHA executive in charge, said in the release Tuesday. \u201cTransparency and accountability are key principles at VA, and they will guide our efforts in this regard.\u201d The regional chief medical officer was detailed to administrative duties and seven staff members were moved into non-patient care positions while the VA investigates.\n\nThe VA attempted to argue that they took immediate steps to rectify the problem once discovered, Military.com\u2019s Patricia Kime reported last night. However, that doesn\u2019t match up to Ross\u2019 testimony in the video above:\n\nThe room was cleaned, but staff could not eradicate the ants. Marrable, who had cancer and was dying, was moved to a different room. He died Sept. 14. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t promote his body to die quicker, what is the protocol within the VA just to manage when something like this happens?\u201d Ross told the television station. The Atlanta VA Health Care System issued a statement saying the staff took immediate action to ensure that no other residents were affected. They stripped beds and rooms, removed open containers of food from living quarters and brought in a private pest control company for an independent assessment, as well as a regional pest control expert from the VA to assess the issue.\n\nThis explanation doesn\u2019t sound sufficient. Ant infestations don\u2019t just happen overnight, not to the extent of swarming over people and infesting the floors, walls, and ceilings as Ross described. She also noted that staff had told her they attempted to clean the room while leaving her father in it, only to move him after a second swarm began developing. Why not move him immediately? And for that matter, why did no one tell Marrable\u2019s family about the attack?\n\n\u201cIt certainly makes you wonder,\u201d a WSB-TV anchor remarked yesterday, \u201chow it got to that point.\u201d There\u2019s no need to wonder, though; we have seen this dynamic over and over again at the VA\u2019s single-payer facilities and system. In fact, want to guess why the highest ranking VA official put on leave for this incident, regional network director Leslie Wiggins, first got assigned to Atlanta in 2013? The Atlanta Journal-Constitution mentions it at the bottom of its report:\n\nWiggins was assigned in 2013 to manage the Atlanta VA Medical Center in Decatur after the deaths of three veterans linked to widespread mismanagement in the hospital\u2019s mental health unit. The then-secretary of the VA endorsed the work Wiggins did a year after her appointment, and she was later elevated to the regional director. Problems remained as the Atlanta hospital received the department\u2019s worst reviews, one star out of five, about a year ago.\n\nWhat. A. Shock. Nothing changes, but the executives keep getting promotions and bonuses. They are the true beneficiaries of this government-run single-payer health care system. And they will be the beneficiaries of the one to come, too.", "description": "\"It certainly makes you wonder how it got to that point.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/marrable-wsb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
