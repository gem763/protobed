And he made the comment back then that only girls have long hair,\u201d said Stephens smiling. Decades later, after a long struggle that had led her to to the brink of suicide, Stephens came out as trans. She wrote to her dad, enclosing photos of her now.\n\n\u201cHe looked at the pictures and he said to one of my sisters: \u2018She makes a better looking woman than she ever did a man\u2019,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cI think that was his realization that, after all those years we argued over hair, there was a reason.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Stephens, others have not been so accepting. When Stephens came out at work she was fired from her job as a funeral director. Her boss, Thomas Rost, a devout Christian refused to accept Stephens\u2019 was a woman. Rost testified that he fired Stephens because she \u201cwas no longer to represent himself as a man\u201d and \u201cwanted to dress as a woman\u201d, according to court documents, and said her proposal violated the funeral home\u2019s dress code.\n\nNow 58, Stephens, modest, quietly spoken but full of steely reserve, is at the center of the most important LGBTQ rights case to come before the US supreme court since it ruled in favor of marriage equality in 2015. After years of mixed decisions in lower courts the justices must decide whether or not sex is a defining factor when LGBTQ people are protected from discrimination at work by the Civil Rights Act, the landmark 1964 legislation that outlaws discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nStephens\u2019 case is one of three discrimination cases involving LGBTQ individuals that the court will hear on 8 October and the first supreme court case involving the civil rights of transgender people.\n\nIt comes as the court has become increasingly right wing and the Trump administration has rolled back hard-won protections for the LGBTQ community, and especially trans people. The verdict \u2013 not expected until next year \u2013 will impact queer and trans people\u2019s lives for generations.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t keep being two people\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u201cQuite frankly, there really wasn\u2019t any reaction,\u201d Aimee Stephens said of when she first came out as a transgender person. \u201cEverything seemed normal.\u201d Photograph: Charles William Kelly/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Stephens was fired from her job at R G and G R Harris Funeral Homes, a family-owned funeral business near Detroit. She had been working there for six years, struggling with her identity.\n\nStephens said she knew she was different from the age of five, but she didn\u2019t have the words or examples in her life to explain it. Growing up there had been no internet, no famous trans people in the media to identify with and no one to talk to. \u201cI knew enough to know that what I was feeling was not acceptable,\u201d said Stephens.\n\nSuffering from depression and with a suppressed \u201cinkling\u201d she might be trans in 2010 Stephens sought out a therapist who gave her homework assignments, going out in public dressed as a woman, clothes shopping, eating in a restaurant.\n\nFirst she told her wife, Donna. Donna\u2019s reaction was one of relief. \u201cShe\u2019d seen the changes in me,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cShe was afraid that I may have been cheating on her. I said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s kinda true, but not the way you think,\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m that other woman\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe therapist wanted Stephens to notice other people\u2019s reactions around her. \u201cQuite frankly, there really wasn\u2019t any reaction. Everything seemed normal.\u201d\n\nAbout 30% of trans female teens have attempted suicide, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The rate for trans male teens is over 50%\n\nThe couple once went to a Chinese restaurant they had regularly frequented. \u201cThe owner asked Donna what had happened to your husband. She turned around and looked at me and said, that\u2019s now my wife. His jaw fell open, he couldn\u2019t believe the difference.\u201d\n\nWhile most of her family were accepting, Stephens knew work would be different. Many of her co-workers knew already, but she worried about her boss. So much so that it drove her to the edge of despair. Tortured by the thought that she would have to spend the rest of days living two lives, she considered suicide.\n\n\u201cI got to a point that I didn\u2019t see myself being able to go forward,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cBut I knew I couldn\u2019t go backwards either. And if I was going to be stuck in that situation, what was the point in going on? I couldn\u2019t keep being two people.\u201d\n\nAbout 30% of trans female teens \u2013 who identify as female but have birth certificates that label them as male \u2013 have attempted suicide, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The rate for trans male teens \u2013 who identify as male but were certified female \u2013 is over 50%. Terrible statistics that Stephens is all too aware of. \u201cBe careful what you decide in respect to hiding who you are,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cHaving been in the position of living two lives at once. It\u2019s hard, really hard, and sooner or later you\u2019re going to come to the point where you can\u2019t do it anymore.\n\n\u201cI would have you choose life instead of ending it all. In the long run, you\u2019re just accomplishing what a lot of society wishes they could do: erase you from existence.\u201d\n\n\u2018This is much bigger than I thought\u2019\n\nIt took Stephens months to write the letter she would eventually hand to Rost. The two had had a good working relationship up to that point with Stephens receiving praise and pay awards. \u201cI was hoping for the best outcome but that didn\u2019t happen. So here we are,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Rost was handed the letter, he read it, put it in his pocket and left. Two weeks later he told Stephens it wasn\u2019t going to work. He offered her 21 days severance and a deal that would sign away her right to take legal action. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cThere was too much at stake.\u201d\n\nOnly 21 out of the 50 states in the US have specific civil rights protections for LGBTQ people\n\nStephens case is not unusual. Only 21 out of the 50 states in the US have specific civil rights protections for LGBTQ people. While it is now legal for same-sex couples to marry in any state, they can still be fired for coming out across much of the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to learn since then that there really is no protections for LGBTQ people,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cThat you can be fired from your job, you could be evicted from your housing. You can be denied medical care and that\u2019s when I started to realize that it is much bigger than what I thought.\u201d\n\nFor trans people, the situation is particularly dire. Nearly a third (29%) of transgender people live in poverty, compared to 12% in the US population, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. The problem for trans and non binary people of colour is particularly acute with black transgender people experiencing an unemployment rate of 26%, twice the rate of the overall transgender community and four times the rate of the general population.\n\nViolence, too is a major problem. Last year 26 transgender people were killed in the US, the majority black transgender women. Discrimination against transgender people is \u201cunfortunately all too common\u201d said Jay Kaplan, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan\u2019s LGBT Project, which is fighting Stephens\u2019 case.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nicoletta Thibeault, right, attends a rally in Los Angeles protesting transgender discrimination. Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nThe Trump administration has rolled back rights for LGBTQ people in general and trans people in particular since Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, shredding federal guidelines that instructed public schools how best to protect transgender students, moving to reinstate a ban on trans personnel in the military, allowing federal contractors to discriminate against LGBTQ people on religious grounds and to remove protections from discrimination for transgender people in health care and insurance coverage.\n\nLack of legal protections has unfairly impacted the trans community for too long, said Kaplan. At its heart, he says, Stephens\u2019 case is very simple and should offer more protection in future. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prevents people from being discriminated against on the grounds of sex. And that definition should include sexual orientation and identity, he argues. \u201cThe definition of being transgender is someone who identifies differently from the sex assigned to them at birth. If the motivation for firing somebody is because they\u2019re transgender, it\u2019s motivated by sex. It\u2019s sex discrimination. It\u2019s right there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ramifications of the case could stretch far beyond the LGBTQ community. In 1989 the supreme court found Price Waterhouse Coopers guilty of sex discrimination when it denied a partnership to Ann Hopkins, a manager who was deemed too aggressive and \u201cmanly\u201d in her behaviour and in need of a \u201ccourse in charm school\u201d according to one of her bosses. Kaplan worries that a ruling against Stephens could support discrimination against people of any gender who don\u2019t conform to their employer\u2019s stereotypes.\n\n\u2018Are these people even awake?\u2019\n\nRost, Stephens\u2019 former boss, is being championed by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative Christian group that has been at the center of legal disputes across the country representing school districts, parent groups and individuals in fights against policies that let transgender individuals use facilities based on their gender identity. It comes after a lower court found in Stephens\u2019 favor.\n\nADF, the Trump administration and others argue that judgement represented overreach by the court. \u201cRedefining sex discrimination will cause problems in employment law, reduce bodily-privacy protections for everyone, and erode equal opportunities for women and girls, among many other consequences,\u201d ADF wrote in its legal brief.\n\nIn this case, as in others, ADF and its supporters are arguing that recognizing legal rights for trans women will make cis-gender women unsafe. Numerous studies have shown that trans-inclusive policies do not endanger cis people.\n\n\u201cIn my own mind I have to wonder are these people even awake,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cTrans people have been around, Lord knows, for hundreds, thousands of years and we\u2019ve interacted with them all the time and we haven\u2019t had problems. So why are we dreaming up problems now that don\u2019t exist?\u201d\n\nThese issues, Kaplan said, are side shows meant to distract. What the court has to decide is whether or not sex is a defining factor when LGBTQ people are protected from discrimination at work by the Civil Rights Act.\n\nKaplan is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that if the court takes a conservative approach and looks at the text of the law, it will find Stephens \u201cwas fired for her sex. She was fired as a transgender woman because she didn\u2019t comply with gender stereotypes.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Actor Laverne Cox attends the Emmy Awards carrying a bag that bears the date of the first supreme court case on the civil rights of transgender people.

At the Emmy Awards last week trans actress Laverne Cox hit the red carpet carrying a one-of-a-kind clutch with the LGBTQ rainbow and lettering on one side that read \u201cOct 8, Title VII, Supreme Court\u201d.\n\nCox, along with actors Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Alan Cumming, Peppermint, Mishel Prada, producer and activist Zackary Drucker and others have promoted awareness of the case by reading Stephens\u2019 letter to Rost in a video produced by the ACLU.\n\n\n\nACLU (@ACLU) Aimee Stephens\u2019s case is a big deal \u2014 the first Supreme Court case involving the civil rights of transgender people.\n\n\n\nSo we found some friends who want you to know about Aimee. pic.twitter.com/re9UQo2Ylv\n\n\n\nBut so far the case has not gathered the same attention as 2015\u2019s historic same sex marriage case. That\u2019s a shame, said Kaplan. \u201cI recognize the fact that marriage is a much sexier issue,\u201d said Kaplan. But as the law now stands you \u201ccan get married on the weekend, come back to your job and if they find out you got married, you can be fired.\u201d\n\nStephens has paid a high price for not conforming to her boss\u2019s stereotypes. She lost medical coverage when she lost her job, a harsh blow for someone who has been out of work for five years and is battling kidney disease. She and her wife don\u2019t like the publicity, and it\u2019s only likely to get more intense. If she knew today what coming out at work would trigger, would she do it again? \u201cDefinitely,\u201d said Stephens.", "description": "Aimee Stephens is at the center of the first supreme court case to decide if sex is a factor for LGBTQ people under the Civil Rights Act", "authors": ["Dominic Rushe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92d9e300efa15b1e9e025da4377a566dd92c4d5c/0_30_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=afcbb56c10fa266b75aa354f48edbf27", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
