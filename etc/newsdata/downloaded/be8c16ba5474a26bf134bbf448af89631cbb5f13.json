This could hasten the government\u2019s move toward renewable energy and reduce support for the oil industry, a major exporter and a big employer in Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Greens are sitting at around 11% public support, more than triple the 3.4% the party received in the 2015 election when May, an effervescent 65-year-old, was the only legislator to win a seat. Public opinion surveys suggest her party might win up to 10 seats in the House of Commons.\n\n\u201cNothing is impossible in this election,\u201d May told Reuters in a telephone interview. In previous federal elections, the party has started well only to flop as supporters backed other more established parties.\n\nBacking for the Greens has surged after a rash of major floods, tornadoes and forest fires in recent years. Climate change is happening in Canada at twice the global rate, according to a recently released government study. Some surveys say the environment is the top priority among voters.\n\n\u201cPeople are experiencing the climate emergency not as an environmental issue, but as an immediate security threat. And that changes attitudes,\u201d said May, who represents a constituency in the Pacific province of British Columbia.\n\nIn contrast to previous campaigns, the sunny and sometimes tongue-in-cheek May is far more personally popular than her main rivals, including Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ekos pollster Frank Graves said.\n\nTrudeau declined an invitation to the first leaders\u2019 debate on Thursday and was not present, yet May pretended to shake hands with him anyway.\n\n\u201cGood to see you,\u201d she said to an empty podium.\n\nTrudeau has had ups and downs in his four years in power. Recently he has been dogged by an ethics scandal, while his main rival, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, is still little known.\n\nThe Greens are nipping at the heels of their closest rivals, the left-wing New Democrats, who are struggling under new leader Jagmeet Singh.\n\n\u201cA lot of this election is about picking the least objectionable but not very appetizing set of alternatives ... she\u2019s the one leader who actually remains above the fray,\u201d Graves said.\n\n\u201cShe does a good job. She speaks sensibly, she\u2019s a good debater, she\u2019s handled herself well,\u201d he said.\n\nTrudeau and Scheer are running neck-in-neck nationally, but Liberals have an edge in a greater number of Canada\u2019s 338 individual parliamentary ridings.\n\nIf Trudeau wins more seats than Scheer but falls short of a majority, as polls suggest could happen, he will need some opposition legislators to agree to help him govern. May\u2019s price for such a deal could prove very high.\n\n\u201cWe will not support any party or collection of parties to form a government that has not committed with real intent and clarity to move away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nShe wants a ban on future crude oil pipelines and to block the planned expansion of the Trans Mountain Line from Alberta to British Columbia, which the Trudeau government bought for C$4.5 billion ($3.4 billion) last year.\n\nWere the Liberals to need the support of Greens or the New Democrats, it would be \u201cdire\u201d for the oil industry, said Rafi Tahmazian, a portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary.\n\n\u201cThe Liberals would be twisting policy much more aggressively to the left to satisfy these other parties,\u201d Tahmazian said.\n\nCanada has the world\u2019s third-largest proven crude reserves and the industry has struggled in recent years due to lack of pipeline capacity. May says she would seek to fill the fossil fuel void by promoting a switch to a clean energy model.\n\n($1=1.3269 Canadian dollars)", "description": "With climate change a top concern heading into next month's Canadian election and mainstream candidates offering little inspiration, Green Party leader Elizabeth May could be poised for a breakthrough.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430120874&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0DX", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
