Some investors said the private plane was a corporate-governance red flag in the lead-up to the company's IPO, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nSee more: WeWork details CEO Adam Neumann's web of loans, real-estate deals, and family involvement with the company\n\nOn Tuesday, Neumann said he would step down as WeWork's CEO, saying the intense public scrutiny of him was a \"distraction.\"\n\nThe company's two new CEOs, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, are looking to offload three businesses it has purchased in recent years: Managed by Q, Conductor, and Meetup.\n\nMultiple employees told Business Insider in recent weeks that staff members were frustrated by the company spending so much on the plane and lavish parties while managers cited a lack of resources when they denied promised bonuses and salary raises.\n\n\"The company was spending $60 million on an airplane, and I can't get a decent raise? It felt like it was 'We over me,' unless me was Adam. And We was Adam,\" one midlevel employee said.\n\nSee more: Now WeWork wants to be a manufacturer.

The jet has multiple televisions and Apple TVs, as well as a central computer to run all media. Staff members \"had to download thousands of TV shows and movies on it for the kids to watch,\" the employee said. \"We literally sat at work for three days straight doing this.\"\n\nThe other modifications were cosmetic, the employee said.\n\nA third employee said the plane functioned as a meeting space for Neumann. Because of Neumann's busy schedule, employees struggled to meet him in the office, so he often hosted meetings on the jet.\n\n\"I know of instances where people got on the plane, flew across the country, and flew commercial home,\" the executive said.\n\nThe Gulfstream G650 is considered one of the most luxurious and popular private jets available. The plane has a range of more than 8,000 miles \u2014 at top speed, it can fly from London to New York or Beijing, while at a slower, more fuel-efficient rate, it can get to Buenos Aires or Los Angeles, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nIt's a popular jet among the rich and famous, as well as the executives of global corporations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz are among the jet's owners, as was the Apple CEO Steve Jobs. More than 350 G650 planes have been built.\n\nGot a tip?
