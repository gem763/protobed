Photo: Netflix\n\nNetflix\u2019s Living With Yourself culminates in a fight. The eight-episode series stars Paul Rudd as both a slumped-shoulders sad sack named Miles, who unwittingly agrees to an experimental cloning process, and the clone \u2014 referred to as \u201cNew Miles\u201d in the show\u2019s promotional material \u2014 who results from said process. The original Miles goes along with the procedure because he\u2019s looking for a reboot; his advertising career\u2019s stalled, his once-lovely marriage has gone anemic, that awful play he\u2019s been tinkering with is just idling in a Word doc. And when New Miles arrives, he\u2019s everything that his beaten-down counterpart used to be: creative at work, attentive at home, and just generally more pleasant to be around. New Miles means no harm at first but, this being a doppelganger story and all, he and the original Miles were destined to be at each other\u2019s throats \u2014 literally. It\u2019s a conflict that Living With Yourself creator and writer Timothy Greenberg was happy to save until the finale.\n\n\u201cYou always kind of know they\u2019re probably gonna fight at some point. Like anything, you want it to be inevitable but unexpected,\u201d Greenberg says. \u201cI think the reasons why they\u2019re fighting now and how it comes to be are, hopefully, unexpected and much richer than they would have been had they had a fight at the beginning.\u201d\n\nWhen the two versions of Miles do finally come to blows, it\u2019s after a full season\u2019s worth of one-upsmanship. The original Miles needs New Miles\u2019s enthusiasm and wholesome ideas to secure a promotion at work; when the clone goes AWOL ahead of a major presentation, though, the genuine article suddenly has to fill in for his replacement. New Miles has a tryst with the original Miles\u2019s wife, Kate (played by Aisling Bea), and nearly woos her away completely, but the copy doesn\u2019t really compare; he simply isn\u2019t the person Kate fell in love with. All of the resentments and feelings of inadequacy between the two Mileses fuel their fight scene at the very end of the season \u2014 a carefully choreographed mess of wrestling, pillow-fighting, twinning, and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation that immediately stands out as an accomplished feat of filmmaking.\n\n\u201cThese things like the mouth-to-mouth, and then the vomiting after that,\u201d says Jonathan Dayton, who co-directed all eight episodes of Living With Yourself with his partner and wife, Valerie Faris, \u201cit was always kind of like, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s so good. Holy shit, how are we going to do that?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the case of that mouth-to-mouth sequence \u2014 in which the original Miles smothers his clone with a pillow and then immediately regrets it and revives him \u2014 they pulled it off via a mixture of special effects and careful staging.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t just do that to air, like I had done some of the other scenes,\u201d Rudd says. Instead, someone had to get into what Rudd jokingly describes as \u201ca green body bag,\u201d then, \u201cto get it right, I had to kind of put my mouth over his chin.\u201d And, of course, Rudd also had to shoot the reverse, with him on the ground as the helpless New Miles. But what really intrigued the actor was the symbolism. \u201cI loved the idea of that,\u201d he says, before adding: \u201cAnd if you could somehow marry these things, two guys beating the hell out of each other and then trying to save the other \u2026\u201d\n\nOriginally, Greenberg\u2019s script was very light on the specifics of the brawl. Once Dayton and Faris encouraged him to fill out the details a bit more, the creator and writer drew on a fight he\u2019d had with an old roommate years ago. \u201cWe had just seen Fight Club, and then we\u2019d gone out drinking, and then we got back to our apartment,\u201d Greenberg says, sighing a little as he cops to this. \u201cSo, we\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s try it, man.\u2019 And we started to get into a fight, and then we started to really get into a fight, and we literally broke furniture. Our coffee table, just like in the movies, was flat on the ground. And, at some point \u2014 one of us must have been moving or something \u2014 we hit a giant box of packing peanuts, so that everything in the entire apartment was covered with packing peanuts like snow.\u201d\n\nDayton and Faris wanted some of that sloppiness and realism in the set piece \u2014 neither Miles knows how to actually fight, remember \u2014 while also maintaining a level of finesse. \u201cThe problem is that, at this point, we\u2019ve seen every kind of fight. And they almost become numbing,\u201d Dayton says. \u201cWe wanted to find this fine line where it was believable but it was also kind of beautiful and absurd.\u201d\n\nSo they enlisted the services of the Kuperman brothers, Rick and Jeff, directors and choreographers who are also third-degree black belts in Kenpo Karate. After initially meeting with Dayton and Faris, the Kupermans filmed themselves executing a few sequences, including a version of the double kick that ultimately made it into the show. In arranging their demo tape, the Kupermans (who are just 13 months apart) focused on moves that would underline the idea that the Mileses are equally matched. \u201cThese two guys have the exact same instincts as one another and the exact same strengths and the exact same lack of training as well,\u201d says Rick, the older of the two. Jeff adds: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like two brothers just going at it, which we have a lot of experience with from our childhood.\u201d\n\nDayton and Faris are acquainted with that sort of sibling dynamic, too. \u201cWe have twin sons, so there was something very satisfying to us about getting to sort of relive what it\u2019s like,\u201d Faris says. \u201cSome of those moments, to us, really felt like they were so familiar and honest \u2014 that thing of kind of hating each other but then loving to fight with each other.\u201d\n\nWhile the Kupermans were able to practice and refine the routine ahead of the shoot, Rudd didn\u2019t rehearse much. That didn\u2019t keep the star from getting into the scrum, though. \u201cPaul ended up doing most of the stuff,\u201d Jeff says. \u201cIt was a particularly grueling fight scene because he\u2019d have to do it and then we\u2019d have to change position and do it again in the opposite way.\u201d\n\nThroughout the roughly four-day shoot, Rudd was switching back and forth between the original Miles and New Miles, changing outfits and playing an array of emotions. But he was just one of the bodies in the mix. Dayton and Faris estimate that about seven people were intimately involved in the filming of the fight, between the Kupermans, a stuntman, stand-ins, and someone who was feeding Rudd prerecorded lines via an earwig so he could react to the opposite Miles\u2019s dialogue. \u201cThe feeling that I had really towards all of them, besides being thrown that they were all dressed like me,\u201d Rudd says, \u201cit was just gratitude toward everybody.\u201d\n\nDespite the scene being very much a group effort, in nearly every shot, according to Dayton, Rudd is at least one of the bodies onscreen. The major exception is the mirror-image double kick, when the two Mileses push off each other, each with one foot; in that case, it\u2019s the Kupermans. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing you can\u2019t really fake,\u201d Rudd says.\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s Rudd with someone\u2019s legs locked around his head, and Rudd whose face is getting pounded with a pillow. \u201cNormally, the stunt guy is the one who takes the hit,\u201d Dayton says. \u201cBut he was actually hitting Paul. And Paul\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t hold back, we\u2019ve gotta make it real.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The season 1 finale of Netflix\u2019s Living With Yourself features a climactic battle between the two versions of Paul Rudd\u2019s Miles.
