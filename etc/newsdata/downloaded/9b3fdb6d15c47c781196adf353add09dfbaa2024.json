Car racing and other sports are in a \u201clittle bit of limbo\u201d as streaming platforms ramp up, according to one IndyCar champaion.\n\n\u201cIt is a difficult time, I think,\u201d Scott Dixon, defending IndyCar champion, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi AM this week, \u201cespecially with the difference between digital media and the transition to streaming and many other platforms. Right now there\u2019s so many choices.\u201d\n\nWhile the IndyCar race can be viewed on traditional television on NBC Sports Network, viewers can also tune in online on NBC and on NBC\u2019s subscription service Sports Gold, in addition to international platforms and on the IndyCar mobile app. But Dixon says the partnership with NBC has been an important opportunity for the NTT IndyCar series.\n\n\u201cThe partnership with NBC has been huge for us to create the continuity between other formulas that we race with,\u201d Dixon adds, \u201cespecially with the Olympics coming up.\u201d\n\nLONG POND, PA - AUGUST 18: Scott Dixon driver of the #9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda during driver introductions prior to the IndyCar Series - ABC Supply 500 on August 18, 2019 at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pa.

If he\u2019s not alone in that opinion, then the decision made by the NTT IndyCar Series to stream on multiple platforms may be right on track.\n\nIn Deloitte's 13th survey of digital media trends, which surveyed more than 2,000 people, it found that more U.S. households subscribed to a streaming service than those that paid for traditional TV.\n\nDespite the changing landscape, Dixon is optimistic that the sport of race car driving is still heading in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is when you go to an IndyCar race and see ... the sights, the sounds, even the smells that will engage you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still have the largest one-day sporting event in the world with the Indy500 and almost 400,000 people in one spot. I think the sport is alive and well.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a Producer for Yahoo Finance.
