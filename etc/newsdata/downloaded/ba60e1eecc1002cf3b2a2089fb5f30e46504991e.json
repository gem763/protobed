This Is Why The Country Is Rising Up.", "language": "en", "text": "Protesters raised new roadblocks and set fire to tires around the capital of Port-au-Prince on Wednesday, as violent anti-government riots that have left at least 18 dead continue to rock Haiti for the fourth straight week.\n\nHaitians first rose up on September 2 to protest a fuel shortage, which exacerbated an already dire economic situation. But they soon turned their attention to President Jovenel Mo\u00efse, whom they accuse of rampant corruption and wasteful spending that has all but tanked the economy.\n\nMore than 60 percent of the population survives on less than two dollars a day, and almost one half of the population lives with less than one dollar per day, according to Haitian economist Kesner Pharel.\n\n\u201cIn terms of public spending, the government has prioritized running expenses over any investment meant to benefit the underprivileged,\u201d Pharel told VICE News.\n\nOn top of that, Haitians are angry that government members haven\u2019t faced justice for allegedly misappropriating aid, including Mo\u00efse. Before his election, the president ran two companies which were later implicated in an independent report on the misallocation of earthquake reconstruction funds. He denies any wrongdoing, and has so far refused to step down.\n\nIn a last ditch effort to ward off the mounting calls for his resignation, Mo\u00efse named six representatives Wednesday to lead negotiations with the country\u2019s opposition leaders including former presidential candidate Andr\u00e9 Michel, and Youri Latortue, a senator who himself has been accused of corruption by the United States.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear if the Mo\u00efse's late gesture will stem the tide against him.\n\n\"Almost all sectors have spoken against him, including the Church and most business leaders,\u201d said sociologist Camille Chalmers, director of the Hait\u00adian Plat\u00adform for Al\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtive De\u00advel\u00adop\u00adment.\n\n\"I think there is a step forward in terms of the political consensus against Jovenel Mo\u00efse,\u201d he added, \"and the political leaders (of the opposition) are maintaining the pressure, because they are aware that they need to break from the current government culture.\"\n\n\"Almost all sectors have spoken against him, including the Church and most business leaders\u201d\n\nLast Friday, in one of the largest riots since the opposition called for operation \u201cpeyi lock\u201d (country on lockdown), protesters gathered outside the United Nations headquarters in the capital demanding that the UN and foreign nations end their support for the president, and let the people\u2019s will prevail.\n\nAmbassadors of several embassies and the UN \u2014 calling themselves the Core Group \u2014 have held meetings with members of the Haitian opposition and business community to try to find a solution to the political impasse. But the opposition refuses to find a compromise with Mo\u00efse and has created a 9-member committee that it says will oversee a transition of power.\n\n\u201cWe are peacefully fulfilling our civic duty, and protesting one more time,\u201d said protester Fran\u00e7ois Gerard. \u201cOne last time, we are telling the Core Group that we are responsible for this country, the destiny of our country is in our hands.\u201d\n\nThe opposition has called for a march on Friday that will only put further pressure on Mo\u00efse. The final destination will be the president\u2019s residence.\n\nCover: A protester hurls a tear gas canister back over a wall toward police in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Monday, Oct. 7, 2019.
