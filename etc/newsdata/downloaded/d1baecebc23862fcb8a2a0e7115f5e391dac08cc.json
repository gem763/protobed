involved in crash does not have diplomatic immunity, says Foreign Office", "language": "en", "text": "Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles, parents of Harry Dunn, leave the Foreign and Commonwealth office in London: Reuters\n\nThe US diplomat\u2019s wife allegedly involved in a crash which killed a teenager does not have diplomatic immunity, the Foreign Office has said.\n\nA letter, that appears to have been sent by foreign secretary Dominic Raab to Harry Dunn\u2019s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, says: \u201cThe question remains when such immunity comes to an end, regardless of any waiver.\n\n\u201cThe UK government\u2019s position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas\u2019 case, because she has returned home.\n\n\u201cThe US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\n\n\u201cIn these circumstances, Harry\u2019s case is now a matter for Northants police and the CPS to take forward.\u201d\n\nThe letter came after the lawyer of Anne Sacoolas, whose husband is reportedly a US intelligence official, said she was \u201cdevastated\u201d by what happened to Harry.\n\nHarry, 19, died when his motorbike crashed into a car, allegedly driven by Ms Sacoolas, outside an RAF base in Northamptonshire on 27 August.\n\nHis death has become the subject of a dispute between London and Washington after Ms Sacoolas returned to the US.\n\nMs Sacoolas\u2019 legal representatives contacted the lawyer representing Harry's parents on Saturday just as they prepared to fly to the US on Sunday to drum up support.\n\n\n\n\n\nRadd Seiger, spokesman and adviser for the family, told ITV on Saturday: \u201cI have just landed on a flight from London and had a very brief phone conversation with the legal team representing Anne Sacoolas.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed to meet each other at the earliest possibility as soon as we can co-ordinate our diaries.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s parents plan to visit New York and Washington DC to \u201cput pressure on the US administration to do the right thing\u201d.\n\nThey have also appealed for any witnesses who saw Ms Sacoolas leaving the UK to get in touch.\n\nMr Seiger said: \u201cI would urge anyone, on either side of the Atlantic, who has any information relating to Ms Sacoolas\u2019 return to the United States, whether before, during, or after her departure, to please come forward.\u201d\n\nThe UK government has sought a waiver of diplomatic immunity in the case, with Boris Johnson calling the US \u201cabsolutely ruthless\u201d in its safeguarding of Ms Sacoolas.\n\nUnder the 1961 Vienna Convention, foreign diplomats and their families are immune from prosecution in their host country, meaning they cannot automatically be arrested or charged for a crime.\n\nHowever, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity in certain circumstances.\n\nAfter speaking to Donald Trump, Mr Johnson said the US president was sympathetic towards Harry\u2019s family on the issue of diplomatic immunity, but that the US was \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to allow one of its citizens to be tried abroad.\n\nHarry\u2019s family have said they \u201ccontinue to live in a nightmare\u201d and have so far been unable to grieve after his death.\n\n\u201cAs if losing Harry was not enough, they now find themselves having to expend enormous time and energy, which they can ill afford, generating sufficient publicity to garner public support to persuade the US government to help achieve closure,\u201d a statement released on behalf of the family said.\n\n\u201cSadly, all such efforts to date have failed.\u201d\n\nThe family want Ms Sacoolas to return to the UK to \u201cface the consequences of her actions\u201d.\n\nMs Charles and Mr Dunn will meet with US media and politicians to ask for support in their son\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cThey are looking forward to making as many new friends in the USA as possible,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s family will simply not leave matters where they are and will do whatever it takes, including taking legal action if necessary, to secure justice for Harry.\u201d\n\nAgencies contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nHarry Dunn\u2019s family left \u2018angry and frustrated\u2019", "description": "The US diplomat\u2019s wife allegedly involved in
