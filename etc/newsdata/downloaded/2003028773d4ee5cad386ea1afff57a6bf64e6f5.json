(Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told a group of lawmakers Wednesday evening that Corey Lewandowski should have been held in contempt \u201cright then and there\u201d when he talked over members, dodged their questions and promoted his possible Senate campaign from a House hearing.\n\nIn a small huddle with lawmakers from across the caucus, Pelosi (D-Calif.) complained that no witness should be able to treat members of Congress like President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager did during a Tuesday hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, according to three people familiar with the exchange.\n\n\u201cI would have held him in contempt right then and there,\u201d she said.\n\nSeveral lawmakers in the room took her remarks as a dig at House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who chose not to hold Lewandowski in contempt for his defiant behavior on Tuesday.\n\nTechnically, staff would have had to draft up a contempt resolution to vote on in committee. And Democrats thought it would be better to keep the focus on Trump.\n\nOthers, however, were outraged and feel like the committee looked weak for not responding. The panel, however, could choose to move forward with contempt at a later day.\n\nPelosi spokeswoman Ashley Etienne confirmed the exchange, saying in a statement that \u201cin a meeting today, a member commented on the level of disrespect that Lewandowski displayed at the hearing for the Committee and Congress\u2019s authority to uncover the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi agreed that his behavior was beyond the pale and contemptible,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Speaker went on to say that he could have been held in contempt right then and there.\u201d\n\nEtienne went on to say that Pelosi \u201calso added that she felt the same way about [Supreme Court nominee Brett M.] Kavanaugh\u2019s behavior during his confirmation hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer comments were a critique of the witnesses\u2019s behavior, not the handling of these hearings,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, members have noted that Nadler and Pelosi have been on different pages for months now. Nadler has been keen to impeach Trump while Pelosi worries about blowback from the caucus.\n\nLawmakers say it\u2019s only a matter of time before the tensions spill out into the open. Impeachment cheerleaders worry investigators are running out of time to oust the president and want to move soon.", "description": "No witness should be able to treat members of Congress like Trump\u2019s former campaign manager did during a Tuesday hearing, the House speaker said during a huddle with lawmakers.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2oyjj6Hr-BOq-LOQLCuSgjVFcRA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EGRM2EG2OAI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
