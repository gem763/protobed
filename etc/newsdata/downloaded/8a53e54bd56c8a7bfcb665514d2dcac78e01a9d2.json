Sterling climbed as high as $1.210 in early Asian trade, helped by the possibility that a no-deal Brexit may yet be averted.\n\n\"The expectation that the Fed will come to the rescue has increased,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney.\n\n\"But it's not a capitulation on the dollar. It's just merely stopped the recent rise of the dollar.\"\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies the dollar traded slightly lower at 98.944, which was 0.4% below the two-year peak it touched on Tuesday.\n\nThe sterling was pushed higher after British lawmakers voted to take control of the parliamentary agenda and scheduled another vote on Wednesday. If the vote is successful, it would force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek more time from the European Union and prevent leaving the bloc without a divorce deal.\n\nThe prospect of a so-called \"hard Brexit\" has been a major source of worry for currency markets. The pound had dropped under $1.20 and hit its lowest since a flash crash in October 2016 on Tuesday.\n\nMore than three years after the UK voted in a referendum to leave the EU, the Brexit process remains unresolved and a source of major political chaos.\n\nPossible outcomes for Britain range from a turbulent \"no-deal\" exit to abandoning the whole endeavor.\n\nJohnson has said he will now push for a snap election, adding another major source of political uncertainty for sterling.\n\n\"We still just can't say what the end game will be,\" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.\n\n\"Die-hard Brexiteers want a Brexit no matter what while the Remainers are deadly opposed. This is not an issue in which both sides can come halfway for a compromise.\"\n\nThe euro was steady around $1.2087, a recovery from a 28-month low against the dollar that it touched on Tuesday, as investors priced in deeper negative interest rates for longer in the euro zone.\n\nThe yen rose to 105.99 per dollar before easing slightly to trade at 105.86 by 0008 GMT.\n\nThere were few signs of a breakthrough in U.S. China trade negotiations with President Donald Trump taking to Twitter to warn he would be \"tougher\" on Beijing in a second term if trade talks dragged on.", "description": "The dollar pulled back on Wednesday as weak U.S. manufacturing stoked wagers on aggressive policy easing, while the British pound recouped losses in the wake of a parliamentary vote that opened the door for another Brexit delay.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103748365-GettyImages-2066491.jpg?v=1498778278"}
