All involved Virginia quarterback Bryce Perkins getting sacked \u2014 quite a thing, given Notre Dame entered the game ranked No. 107 nationally in sacks, set against Virginia\u2019s No. 1. All involved Perkins then fumbling. Two involved Irish linemen rumbling from there. One created an immediate touchdown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey came in the first quarter (one) and the third quarter (two). They proved the most crushing of Notre Dame\u2019s eight sacks (to Virginia\u2019s two). The last of the three, Julian Okwara\u2019s screaming sack from Perkins\u2019s right and Adetokunbo Ogundeji\u2019s immediate recovery and 23-yard run, resulted in the touchdown that finally gave Notre Dame (3-1) some cushion at 28-17 with 1:41 left in the third quarter. The second one, Jamir Jones\u2019s punch-out of the ball to Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa, redirected the game after Virginia barged out of halftime with a binge of cleverness and backbone.\n\nCollege football Week 5 winners and losers\n\nAhead 17-14 way back then, Virginia (4-1) quickly ramped up its threat to severe \u2014 until the whole outlook and game changed in one whoa of a play.\n\nFirst, Virginia kicker Brian Delaney pulled off one of the more artful onside kicks in onside-kick art history, sprinkling the ball over to the right with the accuracy of a throw, so that teammate Bryce Hall could catch it in stride at midfield. Virginia\u2019s ensuing stall still felt harmless when Nash Griffin\u2019s punt got downed at the Notre Dame 2-yard line. The Cavaliers\u2019 defense allowed next to nothing from there, and a punt left Virginia pretty much where it had been, parked at Notre Dame\u2019s 38-yard line.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn third and 10 from there, Perkins backed up and looked around from the pocket, with no clear options but also no inkling the game was about to make a U-turn. Defensive lineman Jones struck free the football, which made a quirky little arc over to Tagovailoa-Amosa, the 285-pound first cousin of Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nTagovailoa-Amosa caught the ball and took off rumbling until Perkins commendably chased him down at the Virginia 7-yard line. Your basic two-play, two-rush, zero-suspense, seven-yard \u201cdrive\u201d commenced from there, Tony Jones Jr. easing in from the 2. Notre Dame led, and would keep that lead even after Virginia punted, Chris Finke muffed it, Virginia\u2019s Joey Blount recovered it, and an excessively cute and incomplete Virginia pass play on fourth and one negated it.\n\nThe Jamir Jones-to-Tagovailoa-Amosa fumble play had doubled as something of a rerun, a similar play having redirected the first half. That one came after the Cavaliers had started off more than well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey had gotten the ball at the outset and zipped 69 yards in seven plays to score, relying on three smashing pass plays. There was Perkins\u2019s 18-yard pass through the middle to Hasise Dubois, who took the first of his nine catches and dragged some defenders along. There was Perkins\u2019s short pass left that seemed to whir right by defensive lineman Okwara to Joe Reed, who took the first of his nine catches and hurried toward the middle of the field for a 43-yard chunk. There was Perkins\u2019s terrific exit from scary traffic on third down from the Notre Dame 6-yard line, when the quarterback headed left and flipped a touchdown pass to Reed, alone on the left edge of the end zone.\n\nEstablished as feisty, Virginia appeared to get a stop straightaway on Notre Dame\u2019s first possession, with quarterback Ian Book running a half-marathon around the backfield toward a harmless incompletion. An offside call sustained the possession and enabled Book\u2019s six-yard pass to Cole Kmet for a first down. Book soon found Finke for 28 to the Virginia 14-yard line. Tony Jones Jr. soon scored from five yards.\n\nThe game stood 7-7, and Virginia moved promisingly to the Notre Dame 34-yard line, but the game proved ready to twist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOkwara managed the double doom of sacking Perkins and plucking the ball free. Notre Dame blasted 54 yards downfield in four plays, C\u2019Bo Flemister banging off two Virginia defenders on his way to an 11-yard touchdown run.\n\nVirginia surmounted all that to get to halftime ahead. Its six-play, 76-yard move late in the second quarter starred two connections between Perkins and Dubois, one for 39 yards and one for a 16-yard touchdown. Dubois caught the latter masterfully against the left sideline, with the ball briefly pressed against his upper face mask.\n\nThe visitors had a 17-14 lead, which melded curiously with their program\u2019s 0-24 all-time record on the road against top-10 teams. Could this become another dream of a day way up this way?\n\nThree ambitious sacks determined it could not.\n\nRead more:\n\nComplete college football scoreboard and schedule for Week 5\n\nA Nebraska fan popped the question with a sign on \u2018College GameDay.\u2019 She said yes.\n\nPenn State wipes out Maryland in Big Ten opener\n\nAD", "description": "Three similar strip-sacks of Cavaliers quarterback Bryce Perkins proved pivotal in the Irish\u2019s 35-20 victory.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VmA4gDQcYJARGEsl5cm8c6I1Z38=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3VNKIXCI4I6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
