He led the nation\u2019s top rushing offense with 188 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries, his third 150-yard rushing game this year.\n\nYet after Saturday\u2019s win, which marked the halfway point of the season, it\u2019s clear that Perry has competition for the most impressive part of this Navy team.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Mids\u2019 defense may not look as pretty in motion, but the revitalized group has played just as big a part in what has been a rebound season for a program that amassed just three wins in 2018.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as dominant of a defensive performance \u2014 I\u2019ve been in this stadium 22 years, man, and that\u2019s as dominant of a defensive performance, against a really good team, that I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d Navy Coach Ken Niumatalolo said.\n\nA few introductory stats from Saturday\u2019s win: It was the first game since the 2013 Armed Forces Bowl against Middle Tennessee in which the Mids\u2019 defense didn\u2019t allow a touchdown. Navy had three turnovers, off which South Florida only scraped together three points; and the Midshipmen now have 17 sacks on the season, five of which came Saturday. In 13 games last season, they had just 10.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNavy (5-1, 3-1 American Athletic Conference) outgained Coach Charlie Strong\u2019s Bulls 457 -264 in total yards, with 434 of the Mids\u2019 yards coming on the ground, and the defense held South Florida to just 3.9 yards per play, below its season average of 5.4.\n\n\u201cThey kept us in the game,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThey kept the momentum on our side.\u201d\n\nZoom out past Saturday\u2019s win, and it\u2019s apparent that the defense has been a crucial factor in Navy\u2019s strong start to the season. A new set of coaches \u2014 first-year defensive coordinator Brian Newberry is one of five new assistants on defense \u2014 is primarily to thank; they turned around a unit that was ranked 103rd in the Football Bowl Subdivision last year in total defense.\n\nAD\n\nEntering Saturday, Navy ranked 16th in total defense and ninth in rushing defense.\n\nThe win over South Florida (3-4, 1-2) came at a critical time. The Mids are entering a gnarly thicket in the latter half of their season with a strong Tulane team arriving in Annapolis next week and a game at Notre Dame and against undefeated Southern Methodist still on the docket.\n\nAD\n\nNavy will need its defense to set the tone the way it did Saturday, when it forced South Florida to go three-and-out on its opening drive. Newberry\u2019s defense glittered in the first half, looking like a new crew compared to last year\u2019s wispy bunch even though most of the players are the same.\n\nAD\n\nThe Mids tackled clinically and had no problem patching over Navy\u2019s few offensive gaffes \u2014 despite Perry\u2019s exploits on the ground, he completed none of his three pass attempts and threw two interceptions, both of which came in the second quarter.\n\nSouth Florida couldn\u2019t convert either into a touchdown.\n\nThe first interception came with just under five minutes left in the first half when K.J. Sails picked Perry off and put the Bulls on Navy\u2019s 21. The Mids\u2019 defense allowed just five yards in three plays, and South Florida settled for a 33-yard field goal for its only points of the game.\n\nAD\n\nThe second interception came with just under a minute left in the half when Nick Roberts grabbed a pass intended for Ryan Mitchell. The defense saved that one, too, when freshman safety Chelen Garnes intercepted Jordan McCloud at the Navy 22 and the Midshipmen jogged into the locker room with their 21-3 lead intact, thanks to two rushing touchdowns and a score off a trick play in which C.J. Williams threw a 23-yard pass to O.J. Davis.\n\nAD\n\nSouth Florida ended the half with just 116 total yards on offense.\n\n\u201cI feel like last year there was a lot of pointing fingers whenever something went wrong. Like, if I\u2019m a linebacker, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the D-line\u2019s fault,\u2019 or the corners are like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the linebackers\u2019 fault\u2019 \u2014 whatever it may be,\u201d senior linebacker Diego Fagot said. \u201cWhereas, I feel like we\u2019re more of a tighter unit. It\u2019s just awesome to play together, because we have that confidence that, \u2018Okay, they might get the ball on the 30, but they\u2019re not going to score on us.\u2019 It\u2019s definitely a different feel whenever we\u2019re on the field or together.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter the blips late in the first half, Perry added a 21-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter and Tazh Maloy notched a 26-yard touchdown run minutes later.\n\nAD\n\nBut the game belonged to the defense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a tightknit group, the defense,\u201d senior Jackson Pittman said. \u201cIf you look at the film, there\u2019s 11 guys running to the ball, surrounding the running back or whoever\u2019s got the ball . . . and, you know, it\u2019s fun. We\u2019re having fun. We\u2019re loving it.\u201d\n\nRead more on college football:\n\nAD", "description": "Perry rushes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, and the Mids hold South Florida to a single field goal in a 35-3 win in Annapolis.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rumCcotybit1_5OllnRAgu3LWqE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FIMU45XS2MI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
