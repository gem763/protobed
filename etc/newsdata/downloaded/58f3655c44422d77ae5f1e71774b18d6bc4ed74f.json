The bra was designed by lingerie brand, Storm in A-G cup, to shine the spotlight on breast cancer and raise awareness this breast cancer month.\n\nSpeaking to IOL, spokesperson for the SA Rooibos Council, Adele du Toit said that Rooibos tea was specifically chosen for this idea because of its properties that help flight the inflammation that causes cancer.\n\n\u201cRooibos tea was specifically chosen as it contains powerful antioxidants that help fight inflammation \u2013 a leading cause of cancer,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cAn added benefit is that Rooibos tea, naturally stains the tea bags red, which created the depth in colour we were aiming for, while creating awareness of Rooibos\u2019 cancer-fighting properties.\u201d\n\nAlthough many may want to get their hands on the CANSA Rooibos bra, the council revealed that it would be going on auction at a private event towards the end of the year and that all proceeds would go towards initiative of the Cancer Assosiation of South Africa.\n\n\u201cThank you so much for all your tea bag donations, you\u2019ve helped us create this one-of-a-kind masterpiece. A huge thank you to Storm in A-G Cup for helping to bring this idea to life! The #CANSARooibosBra will be auctioned at a private event later this year with proceeds going towards CANSA The Cancer Association of South Africa women\u2019s health programmes. A big thank you to our model Sarah-Jane Sings for your time and believing in this cause,\u201d they wrote on their Facebook page.\n\nTake a look at the stunning bra below.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The last thing one could associate one of South Africa\u2019s most popular teas, rooibos, with is a bra.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9435/e98e2f5bf4b4458494457c42e96dc9cf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
