And in the state capital, the mayor says the influx has been a boon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brought in industrious, hard-working people. It\u2019s brought greater exposure to the world and to different cultures,\u201d Austin Mayor Steve Adler said. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive for the community.\u201d\n\nBut it may end. Under policy changes announced by the Trump administration late last month, Adler\u2019s neighbor in the governor\u2019s mansion could opt to block refugee admissions to Texas next year. Trump\u2019s executive order requires state and local governments to consent in writing before people can arrive, meaning a state could ban refugees even when a city is prepared to welcome them, and vice versa.\n\nThat veto power is unprecedented in the history of U.S. refugee resettlements.\n\nTrump highlighted the change at a Thursday night rally in Minneapolis, blaming Washington for bringing in a large number of Somalis \u2014 a remark that prompted many in the crowd to jeer their refugee neighbors.\n\n\u201cYou should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and that\u2019s what you have the right to do right now,\u201d Trump said as images of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who came to the United States from Somalia as a refugee, flashed overhead. \u201cAnd believe me, no other president would be doing that.\u201d\n\nBut critics \u2014 including governors, mayors and resettlement managers \u2014 say the move is potentially crippling for a program long seen as the global gold standard but now reeling under assault from a hostile White House. They also say it opens the door to more demagoguery by Trump, increasingly emulated by others.\n\n\u201cThis is another sign the administration is looking to absolutely decimate the refugee resettlement program,\u201d said Jenny Yang, vice president for policy at World Relief, an evangelical Christian organization that helps new arrivals get their start in the United States.\n\n[Trump administration slashes refugee limit for the third consecutive year to a historic low of 18,000]\n\nThe new policy, Yang said, will give politicians looking to whip up xenophobic sentiment the chance to \u201cdecide who lives in their community based purely on immigration status.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s extremely alarming,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIt harks back to the days of segregation.\u201d\n\nMany details of how the refu\u00adgee ban will work, and who will get to implement it on behalf of a state or local government, are still being worked out amid a 90-day period to formulate the new policy.\n\nSo far, officials have been cautious about saying whether they will exercise the veto. None of the 27 Republican governors and other state officeholders contacted by The Post said definitively that they would move to block refugees. But several said they support giving states that right.\n\n\u201cThere is an array of challenges \u2014 financial, legal and public safety, to name a few \u2014 that states or localities face when compelled to accommodate refugee populations,\u201d said the office of Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall. \u201cStates deserve to be heard before those decisions are made.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott \u2014 who threatened to pull his state out of the refugee resettlement program in 2016 \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nPolice separate demonstrators during a 2017 rally in Laguna Beach, Calif.

(David Mcnew/Getty Images)\n\nThe new veto power is the latest blow to a system for welcoming refugees that long enjoyed bipartisan support, but that critics say has been dramatically weakened under Trump.\n\nFor decades, the United States resettled more refugees than any other country \u2014 and often more than all other countries combined. Democratic and Republican presidents endorsed the program, and Ronald Reagan celebrated it in his farewell address, highlighting America\u2019s welcome to refugees as proof that America stood \u201cfor freedom.\u201d\n\nBut under Trump \u2014 who has speculated that refugees are a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d bent on attacking the United States from within \u2014 the White House has slashed resettlement totals, allowing Canada to speed ahead. Last month, his administration said the cap for the coming year would be 18,000. That\u2019s the lowest in four decades and down 84 percent from the highest-ever cap, 110,000 during the final year of the Obama administration.\n\nTrump bragged of the cuts at his Thursday night rally, prompting loud cheers.\n\nAs the numbers have fallen, the infrastructure to support refugees has shriveled; more than 100 refugee resettlement offices have closed or suspended resettlements in recent years, according to a report by Refugee Council USA.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of people who have been forcibly displaced from their homes worldwide is the highest on record \u2014 more than 70 million, according to UNHCR, the U.N.\u2019s refugee agency.\n\nThe administration\u2019s refugee policies \u201csend a terrible message at a terrible time,\u201d said Nazanin Ash, vice president for public policy at the International Rescue Committee. \u201cThe gap between need and resettlement slots is the biggest its ever been.\u201d\n\n[Trump says he is replacing McAleenan as acting homeland security secretary]\n\nThe White House said the lower totals were needed to focus resources and attention on the surge of asylum seekers at the Mexican border. But policy analysts say they believe the lower cap, coupled with the state and local veto, are part of a broader strategy to weaponize the issue and limit not only illegal entry to the United States, but legal paths, too.\n\n\u201cThis all seems designed to make it more difficult and more unpopular to resettle refugees,\u201d said Stuart Anderson, a George W. Bush administration immigration official and now executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy. \u201cIt gives an elected official who wants to make a name for himself a platform to say, \u2018Oh, these refugees are going to be dangerous so we don\u2019t want them.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUnlike asylum seekers who arrive on their own in the United States, refugees being resettled are thoroughly screened in advance by Homeland Security and need to be approved for entry before they can arrive.\n\nFederal officials have long coordinated with state and local leaders about how and where to resettle the newcomers, with refugees distributed in small towns and big cities across the nation.\n\n\n\nTer Htoo, 53, a Myanmar refugee of the Karen ethnic minority, and his wife have been cutting beef for a decade at a packing plant to pay off their home in Dumas, Tex. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nBut by giving state and local leaders the chance to veto new arrivals, the process could be scrambled next year. While refugees will be able to move once they are resettled, even to areas that have enacted bans, there may not be any support for them once they get there. Family reunifications could also be complicated if a new arrival\u2019s relatives live in a place that has exercised the veto.\n\nRecent history suggests that at least some state leaders will use the veto. In 2015, following terrorist attacks in Europe that came amid a historically large influx of asylum seekers, 31 governors said they opposed letting in Syrian refugees. All but one were Republicans.\n\nA year later, Mike Pence \u2014 then the Indiana governor, now vice president \u2014 sought to stop resettlement agencies in his state from getting reimbursed for the cost of providing social services to Syrians.\n\nThe courts ruled against that move, as they have with other attempts by state or local officials to keep refugees out.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order is likely to prompt pro-refugee groups to file suit.\n\nAuthority over refugee and immigration policy \u201cis exclusively federal,\u201d said Melissa Keaney, a senior staff attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the groups contemplating a challenge. \u201cThere\u2019s been a couple of hundred years of case policy on that.\u201d\n\n\n\nYeon Quinn, left, and Sue Maienschein attend a vigil in downtown Dallas in January 2017.

(LM Otero/AP)\n\nIf the courts don\u2019t stop the order, state and local governments could begin to block refugees as soon as January.\n\nWhile some Republican state officials have been supportive of the White House\u2019s new policies, others have offered implicit criticism, saying that the Trump administration should be focused on providing protection to more people \u2014 not fewer.\n\n\u201cOur refugees make friends, get jobs, contribute to their communities and become a beautiful part of the fabric of our state,\u201d said a spokesman for Utah\u2019s Republican governor, Gary R. Herbert. \u201cWe are glad they are here, and welcome more of them.\u201d\n\nBut Adler, Austin\u2019s mayor, said he is concerned that Texas will veto new admissions, and that other areas will get the benefits his city has enjoyed from welcoming refugees \u2014 including nearly 400 in the past year.\n\nIf that happens, other areas may pick up the slack.\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis said in an interview that refugees had long been a vital part of the state\u2019s culture, and he would welcome the chance to take in more if they\u2019re turned away elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe loss of other communities,\u201d Polis said, \u201ccan be our gain.\u201d", "description": "Refugee advocates fear ugly debates as politicians attempt to restrict who can move in.", "authors": ["Griff Witte", "Roaming America After Years Overseas In Europe", "The Middle East", "South Asia", "October At Am", "Griff Witte Is A National Correspondent For The Washington Post.
