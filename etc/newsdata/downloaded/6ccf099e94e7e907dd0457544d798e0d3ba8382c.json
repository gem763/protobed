Junk bonds still see smooth sailing for economy", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Even as the U.S. Treasury yield curve rings recessionary alarm bells, investors in corporate bonds have largely shrugged their shoulders.\n\nHighly indebted firms are seen as a \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d for a potential recession because their ability to pay down their obligations is sensitive to slowing economic growth. The lack of a protracted selloff in debt issued by sub-investment-grade-rated corporations has therefore been cited by those who remain confident that the U.S. economy can sustain its record expansion.\n\n\u201cAlong with the equity market, the corporate bond market continues to send a much more positive signal for the outlook than the yield curve,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist for High Frequency Economics, in a Tuesday note.\n\nLast month, the spread between the 2-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, -0.55% and the 10-year note rate TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.05% saw its deepest inversion since 2007, falling to negative 5 basis points on Aug. 27. An inversion along that measure has preceded the last seven recessions, though the timing between an inversion and an eventual economic downturn varies widely.\n\nSee: 5 things investors need to know about an inverted yield curve\n\nYet investors in corporate bonds were unperturbed by talk of a recession.\n\n\u201cThe markets are caught between two stools, as the bond market is rallying on slowing global economic data, while the risk markets are not reacting in similar fashion,\u201d said Sean Simko, head of fixed-income portfolio management at SEI Investments, in emailed comments.\n\nThe yield premium that investors demand in return for owning a basket of benchmark bonds over risk-free Treasurys, or the credit spread, stood at 4.13 percentage points on Sept. 2, up from around 3.93 percentage points on July 26, a day before President Donald Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all remaining untaxed U.S. Chinese imports, according to an index provided by ICE Data Services.\n\nThat\u2019s well below the post-crisis average of around 4.81 percentage points, according to CreditSights. Wider credit spreads can reflect when investors are less willing to take risks in search for yield.\n\nRead: Yield gap between risky corporate debt and investment grade sinks to 12-year low\n\nO\u2019Sullivan said the recession probability in the next 12 months based on high-yield credit spreads stood at 14%. On the other hand, the New York Fed\u2019s recession-probability model, which looks at the yield spread between the 3-month bill TMUBMUSD03M, -0.13% and 10-year note, estimated a 41% chance of an economic downturn. This yield-curve measure has been inverted since May.\n\nThe resilience of corporate bond prices and credit spreads to global growth fears and trade uncertainty could indicate expectations for corporate defaults to remain limited in the future, Robert Robis, chief fixed-income strategist at BCA Research, told MarketWatch.\n\nHe also pointed out that corporate earnings haven\u2019t declined as much as investors had worried in the second quarter.\n\nEarnings for S&P 500 SPX, -0.69% constituents fell by 0.4% in the second-quarter, with 75% of the listed companies reporting earnings that exceeded analysts\u2019 consensus estimates, according to FactSet.\n\nThe lack of big ripples in credit spreads, said Robis, could also reflect the challenges of illiquidity in corporate bonds. Investors who wanted to cut down their holdings of corporate debt could take some time to offload their portfolio of securities without incurring discounts. The alternative to rising recession risks and geopolitical worries was simply to increase holdings of highly liquid government bonds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to buy government bonds, instead of cutting back on corporate debt,\u201d said Robis.\n\nMost of all, investors in corporate debt say economic growth has remained resilient. The U.S. expanded at an annualized pace of 2% between April and June.\n\nCorporate bond buyers say households will power the economy forward, with a personal savings rate of 7.7% among U.S. households in July indicating that consumers have room in their budgets to keep spending. On the employment front, job gains have not slowed dramatically, nor has the jobless rate moved upward from multidecade lows.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the economy objectively, it\u2019s hard to conclude we\u2019re going to be in a recession in 2020,\u201d said Gautam Khanna, senior portfolio manager at Insight Investment, in an interview.\n\nThe confidence in the strength of U.S. consumers has helped ease worries that a weak manufacturing sector will act as a harbinger of a recession. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing gauge fell to a reading of 49.1 in August on Tuesday, suggesting that factory activity may have shrunk under the weight of unrelenting trade uncertainty.\n\n\u201cAt this point data such as the ISM report is not a strong enough catalyst to the reverse\u201d demand for corporate bonds, said Simko, who added that easy monetary policy among global central banks would continue to spur demand for higher-income-producing assets.", "description": "Even as the U.S. Treasury yield curve rings recession alarm bells, investors of corporate bonds have largely shrugged their shoulders.", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP636_sailin_ZG_20190816140311.jpg"}
