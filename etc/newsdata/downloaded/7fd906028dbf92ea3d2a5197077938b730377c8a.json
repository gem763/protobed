What would they want with an old duffer like me?\u201d\n\nBut I signed up because I wanted to get the scarlet coat on the telly.\u2019\n\nHe fondly strokes his iconic Chelsea Pensioner livery as he talks.\n\nColin was astonished when he was called for audition after audition.\n\n(Image: Matt Writtle / Evening Standard)\n\nOverwhelmed by the whirlwind of his new-found fame, he didn\u2019t even realise there was a cash prize until just before the semi-final.\n\n\u2018My granddaughter Alice said, \u201cThe money would be nice if you won, Grandad.\u201d\n\n\u2018I said, \u201cWhat money?\u201d So she told me it was a \u00a350,000 prize.\n\n\u2018Well, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 it was \u00a3250,000!\u2019 he says, beaming.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m going to leave it all to my four grandchildren to help them get on the property ladder.\u2019\n\nGranddaughter Alice helps Colin with all his social media, which he admits he finds rather baffling, despite being a dab hand with his shiny new iPhone.\n\n\u2018A few weeks ago Alice said, \u201cGrandad, you\u2019ve got a blue tick,\u201d\u2019 he says, referring to the badge social media companies give to celebrities to confirm they are the real deal.\n\n\u2018I said, \u201cHave I? Is it catching?\u201d\n\n\u2018When she explained what it was I asked, \u201cHow many things do you have to score to get that?\u201d\n\n\u2018She just laughed.\u2019\n\n(Image: Collect Unknown)\n\nSadly, Colin has also experienced the nasty side of fame with some unscrupulous paparazzi.\n\nInvited to sing at a charity event in a nightclub, he was asked to pose with an assortment of glam women, and at one point even had a bottle of vodka thrust upon him, leading to headlines labelling him a \u2018party animal\u2019.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t even drink vodka,\u2019 he says with a sigh.\n\n\u2018It was a bit naughty of them and I felt quite put out.\n\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have been so na\u00efve to be trapped into that sort of thing.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been all around the world and spent 25 years in the army \u2013 I didn\u2019t think anyone could trick me that way.\u2019\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn)\n\nBut for every dodgy pap, Colin has a thousand loyal fans.\n\nHe\u2019s inundated with fan mail from people of all ages, including a nine-year-old girl whose bedroom is decorated with all things Colin.\n\n\u2018I thought, \u201cGosh, this little girl thinks I\u2019m a film star,\u201d when I saw a picture,\u2019 he says with a chuckle.\n\nHe also gets mail of a less innocent nature\u2026\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had a few saucy letters too, and I get a bit embarrassed,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018Some women say things like, \u201cI\u2019ve got a house and a car,\u201d and I think, \u201cBully for you \u2013 what do you want me to do about it?\u201d\n\n\u2018I would love to meet a nice lady, though.\n\n\u2018I enjoy female company and I\u2019m not too old for romance \u2013 although at my age, you want companionship more than anything else.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s so much to talk about when you\u2019re older \u2013 your family, what you\u2019ve done in the past, places you\u2019ve been.\u2019\n\n(Image: Collect Unknown)\n\nColin was widowed in 2016 after losing his wife Joan to breast cancer.\n\nThe couple were together for 66 years, and Colin was naturally devastated by his loss.\n\n\u2018It was an awful shock after so long together\u2026 It\u2019s like cutting off your arm,\u2019 he says, his gaze moving to the window.\n\n\u2018This person who was your life, for all those years\u2026 you\u2019ve grown into that wonderful state of life where you don\u2019t need anything and you\u2019ve got all you want.\n\n\u2018It was shattering \u2013 watching her fight the cancer was the biggest battle of my life.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s a big statement from someone who has been to war.\n\nAlthough he went on to become a highly decorated veteran, Colin has never forgotten the awful things he saw.\n\n\u2018You become inured to things,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018The first time you move a body is awful, and then you just stop thinking about it because you\u2019ve seen so many.\n\n\u2018War is a filthy business.\n\n\u2018You become an animal \u2013 kill or be killed, it\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u2019\n\nColin moved into the Royal Hospital Chelsea after losing Joan, and he now lives alongside 300 other veterans.\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn)\n\nHis fellow residents have been mainly over the moon about his success, bringing their visiting families over to introduce them.\n\nBut living in close quarters can come with its challenges.\n\n\u2018There are guys that I mix with who haven\u2019t mellowed and are still completely intolerant.\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s awful,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I always say to them, \u201cCome on, you\u2019ve got to live with the times.\u201d\n\n\u2018They complain that it wasn\u2019t like this in the old days and I say, \u201cIt\u2019s not the old days any more and it never will be again. Things are progressing.\u201d\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve been chatting to Colin far longer than we should, because he\u2019s just got so much to say.\n\nOne thing is clear: this is one pensioner who is going places.\n\nAfter all, there aren\u2019t many people who are planning to spend their 90th birthday singing to a sell-out crowd.\n\nColin on getting older\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t want to be young again \u2013 I\u2019m happy with my age.\n\n'There\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t have to worry about, like how to get on in life. You\u2019ve accepted what you\u2019ve got and you feel settled.\n\n'I do find failing health tough, though, especially as I was so fit when I was younger.\n\n'The thing that frightens me the most is getting dementia \u2013 I sing to the dementia ward once a week, and I\u2019ve seen how dreadful it is.\u2019\n\nHow do you spend your Sunday?\n\n\u25a0 Lazy lie-in or up with the lark?\n\nI always get up early on a Sunday for Communion.\n\nBeliefs are very important.\n\n\u25a0 Pub roast or family lunch?\n\nWe love a Sunday roast in my family.\n\nThis Sunday I\u2019m going to my granddaughter\u2019s for lunch.\n\nShe\u2019s a wonderful cook and her boyfriend is a smashing lad \u2013 I wish they would get married.\n\n\u25a0 What couldn\u2019t you get through the weekend without?\n\nEating good food.\n\nI try to eat healthily during the week.\n\nIf I don\u2019t want to eat at the hospital, I\u2019ll nip to Wagamama because I love Asian food.\n\n\u25a0 Porridge or full English?\n\nI indulge a bit on a Sunday. There\u2019s a restaurant on the King\u2019s Road where I go for a full English. It beats weekday porridge, and I like to sit and read the paper.\n\n- Colin Thackery\u2019s new album Love Changes Everything is out on Decca Records/Syco on December 6", "description": "The 89 year old Chelsea Pensioner lost his beloved wife Joan in 2016, but he says he's not too old for romance", "authors": ["Rosie Hopegood", "Image", "Bgt", "Collect Unknown", "Matt Writtle", "Evening Standard", "Philip Coburn"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20131819.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Colin-Thackerya.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
