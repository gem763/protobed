I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s right but we will go ahead and of course parliament will come back.\u201d\n\nThe ruling went much further than observers had expected and is a severe blow to Johnson and his team.\n\nHowever, a No.10 spokesman said the prime minister would not resign, though added Johnson would fly back from the U.S. Tuesday night after addressing the United Nations General Assembly rather than Wednesday, as planned.\n\nJohnson said parliament would have plenty of time to debate Brexit ahead of the U.K.'s scheduled exit from the European Union on October 31.\n\n\"Parliament has been debating Brexit for three years solidly. Now is the chance for us to get a deal, come out of the EU on October 31 and that is what we are going to do,\" the prime minister said.", "description": "Parliament will sit again from Wednesday at 11.30 am U.K. time", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1176668887-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
