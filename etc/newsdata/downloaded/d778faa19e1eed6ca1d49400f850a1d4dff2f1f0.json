Now it is pinning the attack directly on NSO Group.\n\nNSO Group vowed to fight the lawsuit in a statement.\n\n\"In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them,\" the group said. \"The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists. It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years.\"\n\nIn court documents filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, WhatsApp is alleging that NSO Group sent malware to more than 1,000 of its users. That spyware allegedly allowed NSO Group's clients to surveil users' messages.\n\nFacebook is claiming that NSO Group used its software to access messages sent on WhatsApp as well as other messaging platforms, including Apple's iMessage.\n\nThe group's software has been used by governments such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico.\n\nWill Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that NSO Group's attack was \"highly sophisticated\" but that \"their attempts to cover their tracks were not entirely successful.\"", "description": "Facebook on Tuesday sued an Israeli cyber surveillance firm over allegations that it hacked approximately 1,400 WhatsApp users earlier this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/facebook_071019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
