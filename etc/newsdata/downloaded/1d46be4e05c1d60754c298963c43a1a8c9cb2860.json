However, alluvial production, which is usually operated by small firms, still contributes some of the country's gold.\n\nInterfax said the miners were part of Siberian privately-held Sibzoloto, which unites several artisanal mining teams. Sibzoloto was not immediately available for comment.", "description": "At least 15 gold miners were killed when a dam collapsed, flooding an artisanal mining encampment in a remote part of Siberia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/44/54/1000x563_cmsv2_19d5cf5a-2e81-579e-b7db-170a4c1213e6-4244454.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
