Podcasts of the week", "language": "en", "text": "Talking points\n\nThe podcast boom continues apace, with an impressive number of people in the UK listening to an audio show each week according to new figures. Ofcom\u2019s latest report shows around 7.1 million of us \u2013 or one in eight people \u2013 are tuning into pods, a 24% rise on last year. It\u2019s unsurprising given the big investments currently being made in the medium (more on that here)\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s five years this week since Serial restarted the podcast movement, making amateur sleuths of its listeners. While not without its ethical controversies, like much true crime, this early hit remains a truly impressive feat of storytelling.\n\nPicks of the week\n\nDear Joan and Jericha\n\nJulia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine\u2019s judgmental, disgusting and thoroughly convincing agony aunts return for another series of the hilarious podcast. Cringe-inducing wisdom is the core of their business, whether they\u2019re telling women over 35 not to have wrinkly babies or warning them to tend to their husband\u2019s \u201cphysical needs\u201d. The chat veers from the absurd to the filthy, all perfectly delivered in the prim way of two know-it-alls who are qualified in \u201cpsycho-genital counselling\u201d and sports journalism.

Photograph: BBC\n\nThis amusing new podcast follows TV outings such as Drunk History and Horrible Histories in making the past that bit more exciting. Historian Greg Jenner, who helped to make the latter show, hosts alongside experts including Dr Helen Castor, a medieval historian who helps to explain the remarkable story of Joan of Arc. Of course, there are comedians, too \u2013 among them Suzi Ruffell, who considers her own identity as a gay woman as they assess the continuing arc of LGBT history. HJD\n\nGuardian pick: Science Weekly\n\nAs part of the Guardian\u2019s ongoing campaign looking at the menopause, last week\u2019s Science Weekly revealed the exciting new insights scientists have uncovered when it comes to hot flushes. Insights that could one day give women a much-needed alternative to hormone replacement therapy. As Hannah Devlin finds out, the menopause has historically been a mystery for scientists \u2013 but could this all be about to change?

Photograph: Randy Duchaine/Alamy\n\nCalling someone a master of radio, you can be accused of hyperbole. But in the case of superproducer Cathy FitzGerald \u2013 the self-described \u2018caretaker\u2019 of the Strange & Charmed school for audio storytellers, which is churning out a new generation of fellow superproducers \u2013 that is literally the case.\n\nHer latest documentary is an explosion of sound and joy that erupts from the very first minute. We\u2019re immediately transported to the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company, which, it turns out, is part of an American non-profit company (826 National) that uses various \u2018cover stories\u2019 across the US to capture the imaginations of children. From pirates in San Francisco to ghosts in New Orleans and robots in Detroit, various tropes are deployed by the organisation\u2019s nationwide chapters. And once under their spell, children can access free tutoring and homework help plus workshops for budding authors. Like FitzGerald\u2019s own audio school, 826 National is more than just education: it\u2019s about confidence, creativity and empowering people to tell stories.\n\n", "description": "Dear Joan and Jericha returns with another round of hilariously cringe-inducing wisdom.
