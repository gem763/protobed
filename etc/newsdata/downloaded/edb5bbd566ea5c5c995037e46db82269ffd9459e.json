In fact, your feeling is more common than you may think \u2014 especially if your kids are younger.\n\nTEXAS SCHOOL OFFERING 'ADULTING 101' TO TEACH STUDENTS 'HOW TO SURVIVE'\n\nA new survey from Kiddie Academy, an educational child care center, found that when all members of the family are polled, 63 percent say it\u2019s Mom who has the hardest time with the first day of school.\n\nThat\u2019s compared to only 27 percent who identified the child as being the one who struggles most.\n\nThis isn\u2019t at all surprising according to Michele Levin, a family therapist and co-owner of Blueprint Mental Health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal for parents to have a tough time transitioning themselves when their kids begin kindergarten,\u201d she told Healthline. \u201cFor a lot of families, this is the first time experiencing losing some control.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s normal for the first day of school to be hard for some parents, Levin says some may need more support than others adjusting to the change.\n\nShe also points out there are a number of ways parents can manage the stress that can come with the start of a new school year.\n\nPractice makes perfect\n\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) spokesperson Dr. Sara Bode, who\u2019s also a primary care pediatrician and medical director of Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Care Connection School-Based Health and Mobile Services, suggests that moms who may be stressed during the first days of school spend some time thinking about what the root cause of their anxiety is and what they can do to soothe it.\n\n\u201cMaybe that means reaching out and asking to meet the teacher or administrators ahead of time to discuss concerns so that you can feel as though you\u2019re doing something proactive,\u201d Bode said.\n\n'BACK TO SCHOOL' ADVICE FROM IOWA SENIOR CITIZENS GOES VIRAL\n\nIn this way, Bode explains that preparing for the beginning of school is like training for an event. And practice makes perfect.\n\nThis extends to forming new routines in the days leading up to the beginning of the school year, too.\n\nTasks like getting your kids to wake up earlier, pick out the clothes they want to wear for the day, or eating breakfast at certain times can all help ease the transition when the first day of school arrives.\n\n\u201cIf you find a way to start those days with your child in the morning with positive actions, that\u2019s also going to lessen your anxiety as you build a routine,\u201d Bode said.\n\nFor many parents, a big part of their stress stems from worrying about the experience their children will have when they begin school and the anxiety they may feel in an unfamiliar place.\n\nBut Levin says it\u2019s important for parents to remember they can\u2019t control that experience for their kids.\n\n\u201cYou can only control how you respond to it,\u201d she said.\n\nLevin says she wants parents to remember it\u2019s not up to them to take away any potential stressors from their children, or to prevent them from experiencing discomfort.\n\nInstead, she says parents should be focused on helping their kids understand how they feel, talk it through, and learn how to cope with whatever\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cAnticipating that and knowing that while it\u2019s really hard, it\u2019s in their best interest to work through this will help parents to better cope as well,\u201d Levin explained.\n\nIn fact, parents who stress about their child\u2019s anxiety over starting school may be making the experience more difficult for everyone, as kids tend to feed off their parents\u2019 stress.\n\n\u201cParents have to set the tone,\u201d Bode said. \u201cIf they\u2019re showing a lot of nerves or anxiety or questioning around whether this is the right school choice or how their child is going to handle going there, their kids are going to pick up on that.\u201d\n\nHelping kids cope\n\nBut parents aren\u2019t the only ones who can experience increased anxiety over the start of new school year. Kids often feel it, too, and parents can play an integral role in helping them cope.\n\n\u201cAnything you can do to minimize the mystery of it all ahead of time is going to help your kids. If you can preplan to have a visit to the school, talking about everything they should expect, and even practicing what the first day of school might look like, that can help,\u201d Bode said.\n\nShe explains this is because kids thrive on routine and like expectations.\n\nHowever, for kids who may experience more than just the normal nerves for the first day of school, Levin says many schools have amazing resources available to help.\n\n\u201cReach out to the school for some support, and they can point you in the right direction, whether it\u2019s tools to implement or referrals to a therapist for additional help,\u201d she said.\n\nTackling that first day like a champ\n\nWhen the first day does finally roll around, it\u2019s not uncommon for younger kids to cling and struggle a little.\n\nFor parents who are already anxious about how their child may handle this transition, they may be tempted to prolong their goodbye. However, both experts Healthline spoke with encourage parents to stick to their planned routine and not linger.\n\n\u201cWe tell parents that prolonging that moment of separation doesn\u2019t typically calm a child down. It usually makes things worse,\u201d Bode said.\n\n\u201cIn a child that doesn\u2019t have a diagnosed anxiety disorder or some other background that might make this harder, it\u2019s usually best to make sure the child knows what\u2019s coming and to then follow through with it,\u201d she explained.\n\nRather than linger, Bode suggests parents assure their child that everything is going to be OK and that they\u2019re going to have a great day. Then leave them with their teacher, who\u2019s likely well versed in helping kids adjust.\n\n\u201cMost of the time, the teacher will say the child was fine within 10 minutes once the parents left. But for those parents who stay, the anxiety only gets dragged out,\u201d she said.\n\nLevin encourages parents to maintain their composure during that goodbye as well, even though doing so may not be easy.\n\n\u201cWhen a child is either crying or panicking or stating, \u2018I\u2019m not going, don\u2019t make me go,\u2019 it naturally triggers a parent\u2019s emotions, and they can easily feel nervous, worried, or frustrated,\u201d she said.\n\nIn those moments, Levin encourages parents to remember one of her favorite quotes: \u201cShare your calm. Don\u2019t join their chaos.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly OK to drop your child off, smile enthusiastically the whole time, and then go around the corner and cry a little. You just want to try to minimize that sort of reaction in front of your child,\u201d Levin said.\n\nRemind them of the plan, tell them you love them, and trust their teacher to handle the next part.\n\nWhile that may not seem easy, it\u2019s ultimately what\u2019s best for your little one \u2014 and you.\n\nClick here for more from HealthLine.com.", "description": "While some are celebrating, plenty of others are stressing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/29/694940094001_6079154538001_6079168801001-vs.jpg"}
