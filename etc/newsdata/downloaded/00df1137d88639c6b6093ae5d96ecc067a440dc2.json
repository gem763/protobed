The book, excerpted by Esquire Wednesday morning, also reportedly includes 43 new accusations of sexual misconduct against Trump. The excerpt does not detail the 42 other allegations.\n\nJohnson told Levine and El-Faizy that she was shocked when the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was released a month before the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cWhen he says that thing, \u2018Grab them in the pussy,\u2019 that hits me hard because when he grabbed me and pulled me into the tapestry, that\u2019s where he grabbed me \u2015 he grabbed me there in my front and pulled me in,\u201d she said.\n\nJohnson told the authors that she was walking to the restroom at Mar-a-Lago shortly after midnight when Trump grabbed her from behind a tapestry and began kissing her without her consent.\n\n\u201cI was grabbed and pulled behind a tapestry, and it was him. And I\u2019m a tall girl and I had six-inch heels on, and I still remember looking up at him. And he\u2019s strong, and he just kissed me,\u201d she says in the book. \u201cI was so scared because of who he was.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who was in her late 30s at the time, said her husband and relative had gone home earlier because her husband, who had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, wasn\u2019t feeling well. She said that Trump pursued her after the incident \u2015 calling her constantly and inviting her to visit him in New York. Johnson said she rebuffed him each time and eventually he stopped calling.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nTrump has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 20 women. The accusations against the president range from sexual harassment to groping and even rape. The president and his administration have repeatedly denied all of the accusations, tweeting that women he didn\u2019t know were making \u201cfalse accusations.\u201d In 2017, then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested that all of Trump\u2019s accusers were lying.\n\nHead over to Esquire to read the full excerpt.", "description": "Karen Johnson made the allegation in an upcoming book, which reportedly includes 43 new sexual misconduct accusations against the president.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e022520000069054fecda.jpeg?cache=k7kghd0qh1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
