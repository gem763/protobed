The elephants were used in a temple festival where they broke free from their chains and ran through the crowd during the parade.\n\nElephants in ornate dress are a major attraction during Sri Lanka\u2019s Buddhist parades. Wealthy families own elephants to show their prosperity and nobility, and parade them in pageants across the country, according to AP.\n\nSome say that the elephants\u2019 behaviour was a result of them being in musth, a period when their reproductive hormones spike, but elephant expert Jayantha Jayewarden told AFP that temple authorities should not have used the animals if that were the case.\n\nOthers believe it\u2019s because the elephants were stressed out by the festivities. Dancers, acrobats, and musicians march alongside the elephants during these religious festivals, which can be very stressful for the animals. The Save Elephant Foundation has blasted these festivals for mistreating elephants, which takes a serious toll on their health.\n\nAfter an incident in which a 70-year-old elephant in a skeletal state collapsed during one of the night festivals in August, the organisation explained the state the elephants are in during such events.\n\n\u201c[Everyday], after their tiring nighttime walk, they are chained and disturbed by many tourists. They have virtually no time to even get a short nap\u2026 Even the processional costumes takes (sic) so long to adorn, amid threats and intimidation, in the heat and the noise, their lives are not their own,\u201d it said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe post goes on to explain that during the night walks, the elephants\u2019 legs are shackled and are stabbed with spears by the men walking alongside them. To make matters worse, the smoke and lights irritate their eyes, causing them to tear throughout.\n\n\u201cWe do hope that the Sri Lankan Government will consider strongly the protection and compassionate treatment of the elephant. Their long history of service and suffering must now be met by a due justice, and honored by respect with vigilance.\u201d\n\nFind Edoardo on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "Buddhist night festivals are infamous for mistreating elephants, whose legs are shackled and stabbed during the parades.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d79fa39eff011000807f792/lede/1568277872376-Screen-Shot-2019-09-12-at-44411-PM.png?crop=0.8355xw:0.9991xh;0.0746xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
