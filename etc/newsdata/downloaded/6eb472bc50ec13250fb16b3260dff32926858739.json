(AP) - Auburn\u2019s Gus Malzahn and Florida\u2019s Dan Mullen first met nearly 15 years ago. Malzahn was the head coach at Springdale High in Arkansas. Mullen was the Gators\u2019 offensive coordinator.\n\nMalzahn had Mitch Mustain playing quarterback. Mullen was on the recruiting trail looking for someone to eventually replace Chris Leak.\n\nThey spent hours talking ball, exchanging ideas and sharing philosophies.\n\nBoth were wearing visors _ and for the same reason: Steve Spurrier. So it\u2019s somewhat fitting that Malzahn and Mullen will match wits Saturday at the field named after the Head Ball Coach.\n\n\u201cThat will be pretty cool,\u201d Malzahn said.\n\nIt\u2019s their sixth head-to-head meeting _ Malzahn has won three of five _ but first in the Swamp. None of the previous games was a top-10 matchup with so much at stake.\n\nNo. 7 Auburn (5-0, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) and 10th-ranked Florida (5-0, 2-0) are two of five remaining unbeaten teams from the heavyweight league, and the winner will remain squarely in the hunt for the College Football Playoff.\n\nBoth have daunting schedules ahead. The Tigers face No. 5 LSU, third-ranked Georgia and No. 1 Alabama. The Gators play LSU and Georgia over the next four weeks.\n\nSo the loser Saturday faces an uphill climb to stay in the mix for even a division race.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t shy away from it,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cThe intensity needs to be there within our preparation all week. \u2026 It\u2019s hard to keep yourself at peak intensity for every single week in a long season. This is one of those weeks you don\u2019t really need to do that.\n\n\u201cIf we do, we\u2019re in a lot of trouble. I told our guys if they need me to give a \u2018rah rah\u2019 to get us going, then they\u2019re pretty messed up in the head right now. This is what you come here for: to play in these games.\u201d\n\nMalzahn and Mullen have plenty in common beyond their visors.\n\nThey each rose through the coaching ranks while being lauded for their play-calling skills. They also won national championships with two of the best quarterbacks in college football history. Malzahn, as Auburn\u2019s offensive coordinator in 2010, had Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton; Mullen had fellow Heisman winner Tim Tebow in 2006 and 2008.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to be an innovator within an offense,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to create outside the box within his system, put his players in position to make plays.\n\n\u201cHe knows how to scratch where it itches: \u2018If you\u2019re going to show me this, I\u2019m going to do this. If you\u2019re showing that, I\u2019m going to do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nNeither coach has nearly as much experience at quarterback this season.\n\nAuburn\u2019s Bo Nix won the job as a freshman and opened his college career with a game-winning touchdown pass against Oregon. He hasn\u2019t thrown an interception since that game and is coming off a 335-yard passing performance against Mississippi State.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Kyle Trask was pressed into action when three-year starter Feleipe Franks broke and dislocated his right ankle at Kentucky last month. Trask rallied the Gators to 19 unanswered points in the fourth quarter against the Wildcats and has been better than expected in starts against Tennessee and Towson. he ranks fourth nationally by completing 77.3% of his passes.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Malzahn and Mullen to help them read and react to stout defenses.\n\nIt\u2019s what made Spurrier so successful in the Swamp _ he went 63-5 in 12 seasons there _ and made wearing a visor cool.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to every other place in our league but Florida,\u201d Malzahn said. \u201cThis will be a first. Looking forward to it. Yeah, that is pretty unique.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Auburn\u2019s Gus Malzahn and Florida\u2019s Dan Mullen first met nearly 15 years ago.
