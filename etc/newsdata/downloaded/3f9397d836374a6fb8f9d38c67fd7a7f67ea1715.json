I am waiting here for someone\",' she said.\n\nMuch to her shock, the man stated it was him she was meeting - not anyone else.\n\nMs Boulden told the publication the man couldn't have looked more different from the photo he had used for his profile.\n\nMs Boulden revealed how scared she was at meeting a man in a bar who didn't look anything like his profile photo\n\nShe said the man's appearance wasn't a matter of weight gain or a haircut - but he was a 'completely different person'.\n\nOn realising the seriousness of the situation, Ms Boulden plotted her escape, taking the first opportunity she could to leave when the man went to the bar to buy a round of drinks.\n\n'I just felt really scared. I had my car parked there but I didn't want him to see what car I was in,' she said.\n\nAfter slipping out a side entrance, Ms Boulden took a taxi home, all while being barraged by a stream of calls from the catfish.\n\nWhat are the signs you are being catfished? 1. Photos are too good to be true: Search their photos using Google Search By Image - if you find the same images on lots of different sites linked to different names or if the images turn up on a stock photo site or modelling site, you might want to think twice. 2. Too good to be true: Online dating profiles can be fabricated. It pays to read carefully, and if something doesn't ring true, it probably isn't. 3. No photos or webcam: Early in your interaction, ask them to send you a photo and if they refuse, you might become suspicious. If they claim to have no access to a webcam (unusual these days), your intuition might tell you something. 4. Saying exactly what you want to hear: Be wary of the person you're chatting to saying all the right things. Don't give too much away either as this can be manipulated by those who might be trying to deceive you. 5. Too serious, too soon: If they move too quickly into the realm of love and commitment, try not to be flattered. This may be a sign that they are not legitimate.
