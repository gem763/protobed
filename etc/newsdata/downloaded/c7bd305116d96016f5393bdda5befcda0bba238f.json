But he recoils at the thought of Benn, who turns 56 in January, returning to the ring whatsoever.\n\n\u201cI just think that people around him, that care about him and love him whether that\u2019s his son, brother or wife, should say \u2018this is not for you, boxing has moved on\u2019,\u201d Saunders explained. \u201cIn 20 years boxing has escalated. It\u2019s changed, it\u2019s about diets and nutrition, everything. Everything has moved on, he should leave it.\n\n\u201cBut someone like Nigel Benn who is always in shape, always keeps himself in shape is always going to have that thought to come back. But at 55 he\u2019s over halfway to 100. Let\u2019s just leave it now.\u201d\n\nBenn became a legend of British boxing as a result of his 48-fight professional career which ran from 1987 to 1996 and included domestic grudge matches against the likes of Michael Watson and Chris Eubank.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI used to love watching Nigel Benn,\u201d Saunders added. \u201cI was a big, big fan. In the Chris Eubank rematch, I thought he should have definitely won when they called it a draw. But now it\u2019s one of them where I just don\u2019t want to see him get in the ring again.\u201d\n\nBoxing history is littered with fighters who are unable to truly walk away from the sport. Like Benn, many return after years in retirement while others try to replace the buzz with substance abuse. British boxing icon Ricky Hatton fell into a deep depression upon his first retirement in 2012 and openly admits he tried to kill himself on a number of occasions.\n\nNigel Benn celebrates after knocking out Gerald McClellan in 1995 (Getty Images)\n\nSaunders, 30, has been boxing since he was a child and the sport has genuinely enveloped his life for more than two decades. He does not, however, anticipate any such problems with turning his back on it completely when the time is right.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the reason you have to hold back and not give everything to boxing,\u201d said Saunders, who returns to the ring on November 11 as part of the undercard for the professional fight between Youtubers KSI and Logan Paul.\n\n\u201cBoxing is a sport and when boxing is gone from my life, I\u2019m still going to be around doing something. I\u2019ve always made sure I\u2019ve got something half-sensible to fall back on and do once boxing is over.\n\n\u201cBut you have to get what you want out of boxing in order to do that, in order to walk away. I\u2019m in boxing to do what I can, get good fights and leave my trademark name as a Saunders. I want to leave a trail where people think \u2018wow, that\u2019s a tough trail to follow\u2019.\n\nRead more\n\nRuiz Jr\u2019s diet revealed as he prepares for rematch with Joshua\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my goal in boxing and so if I achieve that I\u2019m happy and won\u2019t be coming back at the age of 55.\u201d\n\nBenn\u2019s 22-year-old son Conor, who himself is a 15-0 professional boxer, has suggested that it was his own career that enticed his old man back into boxing. He also revealed that the 55-year-old will face a former WBC champion who only fought two years ago. Those clues pointed towards 40-year-old Sakio Bika, who, like Benn, lives in Australia.\n\nAnd promoter Hearn, who counts Benn Jr and Saunders among his clients, said: \u201cI have too much respect for Nigel Benn to criticise him. He must have his reasons for doing it, I don\u2019t believe it is just money. So what are they? Competitiveness? Curiosity? Boredom?\n\n\u201cIf it is Sakio Bika, I don\u2019t like that fight. He is still a right handful, he is strong, he can punch. He is horrible with his head, he is dirty. I don\u2019t know too much about it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether Benn, who is currently 42-5-1, had approached him about promoting his comeback, Hearn added: \u201cMaybe two years ago. He was always going to fight Eubank, that was always going to be the big comeback fight. I don\u2019t understand the Sakio Bika fight. If it was Benn and Eubank, you would think that was big, but Benn against Sakio Bika in Birmingham?\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Ruiz Jr\u2019s diet revealed as he prepares for rematch with Joshua", "description": "Billy Joe Saunders has called on Nigel Benn\u2019s loved ones to try and convince the 55-year-old to scrap his plans for a bizarre and potentially dangerous comeback.Nearly 23 years have passed since Benn last punched for pay, when he retired after six rounds of his challenge for Steve Collins\u2019 WBO super-middleweight", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6RpfDnUJCRVPJRhqkd0Fjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03OTA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LMbufuz4sYfeI1dmnlLjHw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/15fa2cfeb1ffe1b5de76b6a6687888ee", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
