A burst of media attention thrust his small, six-week-old Mexican restaurant into a debate over what it means to casually elevate the president\u2019s words. Critics charge him with helping to normalize dangerous language.\n\n\u201cIt seems like you can make fun of this and maybe make it lighthearted, but you really can\u2019t. You\u2019re offending a whole community,\u201d Patricia Perea, a University of New Mexico professor, told ABC affiliate KOAT-TV this week. \u201cIt\u2019s normalizing the terms \u2026 and the more that you do that, the more likely people are to repeat them and perhaps forget the contexts in which they were said.\u201d\n\nMohamed maintains that he\u2019s satirizing rather than endorsing \u2014 he points to hidden meanings in the taqueria\u2019s dishes \u2014 and that most customers read the menu with interest rather than offense.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a conversation. There\u2019s two more years of this,\u201d he told The Washington Post, referring to the time left in Trump\u2019s term. \u201cNot talking about it doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\"\n\n[Teen goes \u2018blind\u2019 from 7-year diet of french fries, white bread and ham slices, doctors say]\n\nKOAT\u2019s report on Monday kicked off a flurry of scrutiny. However, Mohamed says he has offered polarizing names on his menus for years. Before Urban Taqueria opened downtown in July, he ran a similar restaurant in a quieter part of town, to little fanfare.\n\nHe said he peppered the menu with presidential quotes and other political phrases in early 2017, around when Trump took office. One of the president\u2019s first acts was a travel ban targeted at seven majority-Muslim countries \u2014 an executive order that dismayed Mohamed, a Muslim who immigrated decades ago from Kenya. He recalls the discomfort of being scrutinized while flying in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nMohamed says he tried to keep the menu \u201cneutral\u201d by including a range of political phrases, not just Trump talking points: Other items include the \u201cPopular Vote,\u201d \u201cExecutive Privilege\u201d and \u201cCredible Sources.\u201d\n\nThere are subtexts, too, for customers who look deeper than the names, he said. He said it\u2019s no mistake that a taco dubbed \u201cThe Republicans\u201d is made from pork, a meat Muslims avoid, in a Mexican style known as \u201cal pastor,\u201d with influences from shawarma and Lebanese immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe food is a fusion of cultures,\u201d he said, drawing a contrast between that ethos and Republicans\u2019 increasingly hard line on immigration.\n\nMaybe those details are too subtle for people just hungry for a taco, he acknowledged.\n\nBut \u201cif they ask, we can talk about it,\u201d Mohamed said.\n\n[Forget Popeyes: A viral tweet has customers lining up outside this immigrant-owned chicken sandwich restaurant in D.C.]\n\nOnline reviews suggest many patrons just smile at the names and move on. Customer Stephanie Santillanes told The Post that she laughed out loud at titles such as \u201cThe Stormy\u201d and sees Urban Taqueria as simply inviting discussion. But she says she does worry about the government\u2019s approach to immigration, one of the issues on which the menu quotes the president. And Juan Lucero, who stopped at Urban Taqueria for dinner on his way to California, said the references to Trump controversies didn\u2019t faze him as a Republican.\n\n\u201cWe live in a world where we got to laugh sometimes and not take things so serious,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers find the menu\u2019s casual reference to political flash points such as a border wall more troubling, especially amid concern over the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of migrants and accusations that the president\u2019s language on immigration feeds hatred. Some interpret the menu as pro-Trump.\n\n\u201cIn a cynical attempt to garner business this business is promoting division and hate,\u201d one person wrote in a review on Facebook, adding that the president would \u201cgladly deport everyone working here.\u201d\n\nA Yelp reviewer wrote that her co-worker refused to eat at a place with a burrito called \u201cLock Her Up.\u201d Another downgraded a three-star review on the site to two stars on further reflection, explaining, \u201cgotta dock it one star for the cringy menu titles. No matter your political leaning they are pretty offensively odd.\u201d\n\nMohamed, however, doesn\u2019t plan on changing the names. He said his employees \u2014 many of whom immigrated from Mexico \u2014 have not raised concerns about the names over several years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking that by the end of the week, it\u2019s probably going to blow over,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nA man pulled a gun to demand Popeyes chicken sandwiches after they sold out\n\nAn English teacher who misexplained \u2018niggardly\u2019 now faces a hearing to keep his job\n\nConversion therapy center founder who sought to turn LGBTQ Christians straight says he\u2019s gay, rejects \u2018cycle of self shame\u2019", "description": "A burst of media attention has thrust a small, six-week-old Mexican restaurant into a debate over what it means to casually elevate the president\u2019s words.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "Hannah Knowles Is A Reporter On The General Assignment Team.
