It was 2004 and she was living in Cologne. Two years earlier prostitution had been legalised across Germany, and the city of Cologne quickly distinguished itself: it made sex work a major part of its urban policy.\n\nFor workers like Schulze, this created a unique set of conditions. The city reasoned that if sex work was going to happen, it should be in a safe and clean space. It was decided that sex work would be allowed only in certain parts of the city \u2013 and in order to encourage both sex workers and their customers to abide by this rule, in one of the permitted areas the city built a facility specifically for sex.\n\nLocated on the edge of town, the result is a kind of sex drive-through. Customers drive down a one-way street, into a roughly two-acre open air-space where sex workers can offer their services. Once hired, the sex worker accompanies the customer into a semi-private parking stall. For safety, each stall allows sex workers to easily flee if necessary \u2013 the stall is designed so that the driver\u2019s door can\u2019t be opened, but the passenger one can \u2013 and there\u2019s an emergency button to call for help. Social workers are present on site and offer a space to rest, stay warm and access services.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amsterdam\u2019s first female mayor, Femke Halsema, has announced a plan to rethink the way the city accommodates sex work.

In Berlin, officials are considering a proposal to install Cologne-style facilities for sex workers and their customers in what is now the city\u2019s main red-light district, south of Tiergarten park.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of the stalls in Cologne\u2019s drive-in brothel.

For years he has struggled to balance the rights of street-based sex workers with the desires of the surrounding community. Residents frequently complain about people having sex in parks, about used condoms littered on sidewalks, and about sex workers defecating in bushes. \u201cPeople of the neighbourhood come to me and say \u2018How can you accept this? You have to do something,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nOne proposed solution, to be debated in parliament in the autumn, is to build stalls where sex workers and their customers can meet. But Von Dassel worries that these will only lead to more activity in public spaces. He wants the city to consider broader issues surrounding sex work, such as human trafficking, drug abuse and violence.\n\n\u201cIs it just an add-on to the city\u2019s sexual infrastructure?\u201d he asks of the stalls. \u201cOr \u2013 and this is what I want \u2013 is it a chance to discuss everything anew and to help the neighbourhood to solve a lot of problems?\u201d\n\nIn Amsterdam, home to perhaps the world\u2019s most famous red-light district, the city\u2019s first female mayor, Femke Halsema, has announced a plan to rethink the way sex work is accommodated. She has suggested four new scenarios: closed curtains on the 330 permitted window displays; a reduced number of displays; segregating sex work on the city\u2019s edge; or opening more window displays.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sex workers operating from caravans in Eifelwall, Cologne.

Large crowds of sex workers attended, and there were big cheers for the mayor\u2019s fourth scenario, to add more window displays. \u201cThey even had signs up saying \u2018Option 4,\u2019\u201d Meijer says.\n\nThe scenarios will be debated by the city council with public input from residents, sex workers and business owners, and a council vote on the preferred option later this year. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a fifth one we haven\u2019t come up with yet,\u201d Meijer says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A protest against the closure of window brothels in Amsterdam in 2015. Photograph: Robin van Lonkhuijsen/EPA\n\nSome sex workers remain skeptical that these new efforts to improve public infrastructure is properly considering their needs.\n\n\u201cNow the justification is about sex workers not being respected around tourists,\u201d says Luca Stevenson of the International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe, which represents about 100 sex worker groups in 30 countries. \u201cBefore that it was about trafficking. Often the ends of these proposals are to limit the space sex workers take in the city. I think there\u2019s a lot of hypocrisy behind this.\u201d\n\nHe says that even in cities and countries where prostitution is legal, proposals often have the effect of criminalising sex work. \u201cWe think that the needs of sex workers should be considered a priority by cities and governments rather than focusing on the potential nuisance,\u201d he says.\n\nSome see a model in New Zealand, where prostitution was decriminalised in 2003. Catherine Healy is the national coordinator of the New Zealand Prostitutes\u2019 Collective, a support group she and fellow sex workers founded in the late 1980s. She says that organisations representing sex workers are almost always at the negotiating table when new policies are under consideration. \u201cIt would be quite rare for us to not be the first or nearly the first port of call if something in relation to sex work came up,\u201d she says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A sign displayed in many of the booths in Amsterdam\u2019s red light district.

The collective now operates five centres that offer access to showers, food, information, sexual health services and places to rest \u2013 \u201cstuff that wasn\u2019t there when I was a girl, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Healy says.\n\nAmsterdam's sex workers: the unlikely victims of gentrification Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s most important that sex worker-led organisations are sourced in this regard,\u201d she says. \u201cUsually that is the most effective way to deliver services to sex workers because they\u2019re informed on a very intimate level about what it is that sex workers need.\u201d\n\nThe system isn\u2019t perfect, Healy says, but New Zealand has gradually become a place where the needs of sex workers and the spaces they use have become topics of open dialogue. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief for us that we have that kind of communication and an effective way of working together,\u201d she says.\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "From covered stalls for prostitution in Germany to community centres for sex workers in New Zealand, some cities now include sex work in their urban policy", "authors": ["Nate Berg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41bcf4ed902271fcdca7242f2b2c3913cfbde61c/0_0_1810_1086/master/1810.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c3e250cb41b14f6f1e4bc11d2f7d0156"}
