Millions of us seeing Dorian turn away from land is not a wacky idea; it is a creative use of the power of the mind. Two minutes of prayer, visualization, meditation for those in the way of the storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seemed to imply that good energy can offset bad hurricanes,\u201d Velshi said as Williamson attempted to laugh off the line of questioning.\n\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t,\u201d Williamson said, shaking her head. \u201cThe only problem there is that I deleted that tweet.\u201d She then added, \u201cI\u2019m Jewish, I go to the doctor\u201d\u2014a line she uses in almost every interview.\n\nWhen Williamson insisted there\u2019s \u201cnothing anti-science\u201d about her, Velshi pushed back, \u201cIt sort of felt a little anti-science-y\u201d to laughs from the audience of students at Georgetown University.\n\nSpeaking of Georgia residents she met as Hurricane Dorian approached land, Williamson asked, \u201cYou think they weren\u2019t praying for that thing to turn around? And are we just going to talk down to them? You think that everybody who prays in those Southern states, were praying \u2018Dear God, turn this hurricane around,\u2019 you think they\u2019re stupid? That\u2019s real smart strategy, Democratic leftists. That\u2019s real smart strategy, mock and make fun of anyone who believes God is powerful.\u201d\n\nAs a \u201cwoman who believes in God,\u201d Williamson said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t believe in science, it doesn\u2019t mean that I lost some brain cells, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m less intelligent.\u201d\n\nFinally, Williamson admitted that the only reason she deleted the tweet is because the author Joyce Carol Oates criticized her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m such a fan of Joyce Carol Oates, I\u2019ve read all her books,\u201d she said.\n\nOates replied to the tweet by writing, \u201cridiculous. \u2018two minutes of prayer, visualization, meditation\u2019 is not enough if you are hoping to move just a fork across a table by the power of your mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s so stupid to delete a tweet when you\u2019re in the public eye,\u201d Williamson added. \u201cBecause all that means is it\u2019s going to get more attention. As soon as I deleted it, I went, \u2018Oh no!\u2019\u201d", "description": "The 2020 candidate said her only regret was deleting the tweet that suggested people could move Hurricane Dorian away from land with \u201ctwo minutes of prayer.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1438,w_2556,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568918264/MW_vy3ltu", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
