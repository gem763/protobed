The latter can lead to warrantless searches from local police, the most common of which involve marijuana possession.\n\nIf, for example, a passenger smells marijuana in another cabin and reports it to ship personnel, the complaint may be forwarded to the ship's security department, which may alert local police at the ship's next destination. Once the ship arrives at that destination, the local police may search the room in question without a warrant. If the local officials find even a small amount of marijuana, the passenger may face an ultimatum: pay a fine or spend time in jail, Walker said.\n\nThis scenario happens most often in Bermuda and the Bahamas, according to Walker.\n\n\"This happens so frequently, and there's nothing anybody can do for them. There's no right to hire a local attorney or consult with an attorney when you're in Nassau,\" he said.\n\nThe Tribune, a Bahamian newspaper, reported in 2016 that a Bahamian magistrate told an American Carnival Cruises passenger found with nine grams of marijuana that he would spend three months in jail if he did not pay a $500 fine. In 2014, The Tribune reported that four American cruise ship passengers found with marijuana received a choice between paying $300-$500 fines or spending between one and two months in jail.\n\nThe Bahamas Ministry of Tourism and Bermuda Ministry of Tourism and Transport did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHave you worked on a cruise ship?
