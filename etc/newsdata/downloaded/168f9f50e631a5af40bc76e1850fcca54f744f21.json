We're trying to take back our lives.\"\n\nTownhall asked Hogg and Ariel Hobbs, a student executive board member at March For Our Lives, how can they reconcile his previously made statements to the group's now-praise of former Rep. Beto O'Rourke's \"hell yes\" rallying call to confiscate AR-15s and AK-47s.\n\n\"When you talk to gun owners that use guns for sport, like hunting or different things, they understand that when we talk about removing AR-15s, that they don't need an AR-15 to hunt. You do not need an AR-15 to defend yourself. It's a weapon of war, that's just what it is,\" Hobbs said.\n\nHobbs said as long as there are AR-15s in communities, \"then there is a chance that weapon of war will be used on someone, like how we've seen in multiple mass shooting in this country.\"\n\n\"And so, you have people that are afraid that they're coming to take their guns, and I completely understand that and we don't want to take their guns,\" she said, but said they do want to take AR-15s and similar types of rifles when asked to clarify their position.\n\nAt the same event, when asked if it is misleading to call AR-15s \"weapons of war\" since the U.S. military does not issue them, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Navy veteran, said, \"The point is not the small differences in firing mechanisms or certain capabilities. The point is that they're weapons with destructive power that there is simply no justification for them to be in civilian hands.\"", "description": ".10/03/2019 3:13:35AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/275/d3a4a307-5e1a-450f-b149-6e7d1385e453.jpg"}
