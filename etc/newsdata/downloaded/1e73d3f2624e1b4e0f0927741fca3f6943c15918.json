Because the Nationals won Game 6 and knotted the Series, we have a Game 7 on Wednesday, which is the highest of high holy baseball days. Yet it feels more strange than apt. Save for the first game, a 5-4 win for the Nationals, the Series has largely been bleached clean of suspense, with an average margin of victory of 5.1 runs.\n\nThe Nationals won the first two games on the Astros\u2019 home turf, then the Astros returned the favor, taking three straight from the Nationals in Washington.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that much of the series has been played in the shadow of overlapping controversies. Early on, there was the Houston Astros assistant general manager, Brandon Taubman, who chose the occasion of the Astros\u2019 pennant-winning victory over the Yankees to pull a cigar out of his mouth and bellow foul idiocies at three female reporters about the charms of the team\u2019s closer, Roberto Osuna, who had beaten his girlfriend about in Canada. A Sports Illustrated reporter wrote an accurate account of his crudity, and the Astros\u2019 response became a study in crisis P.R. gone whack. They released a snotty and thoroughly inaccurate claim that Sports Illustrated had peddled false news. Several iterations of walk-back occurred before Astros management was left sitting in a puddle of abject apology.\n\nThen they fired Taubman.\n\nIn Game 5 in Washington, attention was diverted away from the field again. President Trump turned up and took a cold shower of boos which his memory has not yet alchemized into thunderous applause and two models popped up behind home plate, pulled up their shirts and bared their breasts as Houston\u2019s Gerrit Cole peered in at his catcher for a sign. If it\u2019s not clear that Cole noticed, it\u2019s clear that many fans did.\n\nThat set the stage for Game 6, which was a taut affair for six innings. There were home runs and sweet fielding plays and spectacular pitching by Stephen Strasburg, who varied speed and location and was masterful. It\u2019s worth recalling that baseball tough guys got exercised back in 2012, when he returned from elbow surgery and the Nationals shut him down before the playoffs rather than insist he push his surgically repaired elbow.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pampering this kid,\u201d they moaned. Strasburg has become one of baseball\u2019s best postseason pitchers, 6-2 with a 1.46 E.R.A. in nine games, tossing 71 strikeouts in 55\u2153 innings. Contrast that with the sad tale of Matt Harvey, who was persuaded to pitch way beyond agreed innings limits in the Mets\u2019 2015 playoff push and has never been the same.\n\nI apologize. I\u2019m talking baseball when I could be talking baseball delay. The did-Trea-Turner-interfere-or-not debate dragged on, and you wondered if in the replay center panicked M.L.B. sorts were ready to flip a coin.", "description": "The game simply halted, lost in one of those Talmudic debates that enthrall hardball devotees and mystify everyone else.", "authors": ["Michael Powell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/sports/30powellWEBSUB/30powellWEBSUB-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
