Basically, he's not Matt!' she said of the man she called 'Dr. Hottie.' 'I feel like that's really good for me right now.'\n\nNew look: The 35-year-old reality star was trying to move on and dyed her hair platinum blonde\n\nMatt had no idea Gina was dating, and had them go see a therapist together to work out their issues.\n\nGina, who got dolled up for the therapy session, told Tamra that Matt was looking for jobs in Orange County.\n\nShe admitted to thinking about giving their relationship another shot, not wanting to regret it for their kids.\n\nAnother shot? Gina admitted to thinking about giving their relationship another shot, not wanting to regret it for their kids\n\n'It's alarming that Matt walked into my home in the middle of the night, but to be honest, also, it feels good that Matt cares about me,' she shared.\n\n'Ultimately, I think I will regret it if I don't follow my heart, even if it is not the smartest decision,' Gina said.\n\nGina earlier told pal Emily Simpson, 43, that Matt was aggressively pursuing her.\n\nStill trying: Emily Simpson asked Gina if Matt was trying to have sex with her or attempting to get back together\n\n'He's like, one hundred percent, ''I can't be without you.

'She just decided she wasn't going to eat food anymore.'\n\n'She'd always been the perfect child,' Braunwyn mused, calling Rowan 'the one we didn't have to worry about.'\n\nRowan said the hardest part of her OCD had been 'losing that part of myself that took that long to come back.'\n\nHardest part: Rowan said the hardest part of her OCD had been 'losing that part of myself that took that long to come back'\n\nHer family flew in from all over the country to attend her show, and her mom toasted her success, saying 'Here is to the coolest f***ing family ever!'\n\nOver at her house, Shannon, 55, helped Adeline work on her walk, saying: 'You've got to see the ass wiggle.'\n\nShe coached her daughter all the way down the gangway, and inside the yacht, too, telling her to pop her hips and 'Stop smiling!'\n\nSupportive mom: Shannon Beador at home helped Adeline work on her walk, saying: 'You've got to see the ass wiggle'\n\nStill coaching: Adeline was encouraged by Shannon to work on her walk on the gangway to the fashion show\n\n'I think Adeline is killing it, and I think my mom\u2014literally if she does not shut her mouth, I will shut it for her,' said Shannon's other daughter, Sophia, 18.\n\nAt the show, Rowan's guests were ushered into a private room to await its start, but her grandmother, the ostentatiously dressed Dr. Deb, went to the bathroom first.\n\nSecurity then took her by the arm, which spurred her to growl, 'Don't touch me!'\n\nKilling it: Shannon coached Shannon before the show and told her to pop her hips\n\nShut it: Sophia thought that her mother Shannon was overdoing it with the coaching and threatened to shut her mom's mouth if she didn't stop\n\n'We don't know who you are, sweetheart,' the event's producer Kathy Marino told Deb.\n\n'She did not mean sweetheart,' Deb said later. 'She meant, ''Hey, b****.''\n\nThat set Braunwyn off, and she walked over to Kathy, saying: 'I think you need to apologize to my mom right now, because if you don't, it's going to be a bad night.'\n\nSecurity incident: Braunwyn's mother Dr Deb was stopped by security at the fashion show\n\n'I don't have the psychic skills to know in advance who your guests are, do you understand?' Kathy said to Braunwyn.\n\nWhen Kelly Dodd told her to 'be professional,' the woman spoke into a microphone and said 'I am working and I will be as loud as I can.'\n\n'You're a freaking psycho, girl,' Kelly, 44, announced, as the woman kept sticking her microphone in Kelly's face, mentioning 'defamation.'\n\nThe producer: OC Fashion Week producer Kathy Marino told Braunwyn she didn't have psychic skills and didn't know all of Braunwyn's guests\n\nHeated moment: Kelly Dodd got in on the action and called Kathy a 'freaking psycho'\n\n'It's Adeline and Rowan. Just think about that,' Braunwyn begged Kelly. 'Pretend like she doesn't exist. We're not screwing it up for the kids.'\n\n'I thought for sure there was a misunderstanding,' Braunwyn told the cameras. 'I had no idea this woman was going to go off the rails. Oh, no, there's lines and you just crossed one.'\n\n'I'm going to throw her off the f***ing boat,' she swore.\n\nLine crossed: Braunwayn told her husband Sean that she was ready to throw Kathy off the 'f***ing boat'\n\n'My knee jerk reaction was to slap the s*** out of her,' Kelly agreed. 'But I didn't, 'cause there's children around.'\n\nKathy referenced a local teen's fashion program that was anti-bully, suggesting 'any witnesses to verbal abuse' that evening should hashtag #anti-bully.\n\nAfter that, the show went off without a hitch, and Shannon nearly cried when she saw Adeline walk, saying, 'It's almost like I'm seeing a different child.'\n\nBullying speech: Kathy referenced a local teen's fashion program that was anti-bully, suggesting 'any witnesses to verbal abuse' that evening should hashtag #anti-bully\n\nRunway model: Adeline walked the runway in Rowan's dance wear line Dark Rabbit\n\nBraunwyn's anger at the show producer resurfaced during the car ride home and she yelled: 'Don't f*** with my family, don't f*** with my friends.'\n\nShe said she'd never had a protector growing up, as her dad, a big-wave surfer in Hawaii, was a 'functional alcoholic,' so it made her fierce in defending her family.\n\nEmily echoed that sentiment when she went horseback riding the next day with Braunwyn, saying her parents had divorced when she was six years old.\n\nFather issues: Braunwyn and Emily talked about their absentee fathers growing up\n\n'Not having a dad in my life just made me always achieve things so I could take care of myself\u2026 so I didn't have to depend on a man,' she said.\n\n'It took Sean 15 years for me to let him love me,' Braunwyn returned, citing her own abandonment issues.\n\nElsewhere on the episode, Tamra struggled with worries about her son Ryan, 33.\n\nWorried mom: Tamra Judge meanwhile was worried about her 33-year-old son Ryan\n\nShe took him to a laser center to get a tattoo on his neck removed, noting with concern that he was dressed in American flag gear.\n\nShe'd been worrying recently about Ryan's oddly patriotic bent, feeling that he was so into supporting President Donald Trump that it was like he was 'in a Trump cult.'\n\nTamra was not a fan of the commander-in-chief, noting: 'I don't like his bedside manner, I don't like the things he says about women, I don't like a lot of things about him.'\n\nFlag shirt: Ryan wore a US flag hat and shirt and Tamra said that he was so into supporting President Donald Trump that it was like he was in a 'Trump cult'\n\n'But I can't judge my son by his love of Donald Trump,' she added.\n\nRyan's ink had read 'Money on My Mind,' and he said that as he got older, he just wanted to cover everything up.\n\n'My life's a little up and down lately,' he told his mom, reluctant to talk about his feelings but admitting privately that he felt like he'd gotten short shrift growing up.\n\nTattoo removal: Tamra took Ryan to a laser center to get a tattoo on his neck removed\n\nLaser removal: Ryan's ink had read 'Money on My Mind,' and he said that as he got older, he just wanted to cover everything up\n\n'I think that Ryan wanting to remove some of these tattoos is a sign of growth,' Tamra said. 'But I can see that he really needs help.'\n\nRyan later confessed he had been secluding himself, and shared that he felt estranged from his parents as a teen.\n\n'I feel like I was a trial run,' he told the cameras. 'No one prepped me for life.'\n\nTrial run: In a confessional, Ryan admitted that he felt like a 'trial run' and claimed no one prepped him for life\n\n'You make all the mistakes with me, and everyone else got the good stuff,' he added.\n\nTamra hooked him up with a 'life coach,' hoping a professional therapist would help.\n\n'I'm actually getting really scared for Ryan,' she said.
