Not sure about this one chief.\u201d\n\nReports in Bulgaria suggest that Balakov - who played in the Bulgarian team which finished fourth in the 1994 World Cup - could now quit after FA president Borislav Mihaylov was forced to offer his resignation.\n\nMihaylov had entered into a war of words with Gareth Southgate and the FA after also denying Bulgaria had a problem with racism before the game even though their stadium had been partially closed for a previous offence.\n\n(Image: Eddie Keogh for The FA/REX)\n\nUEFA have now charged Bulgaria after the England game and have launched a full scale investigation which could see them get a full stadium ban.\n\nHowever, there has been a backlash in Bulgaria against Mihaylov\u2019s resignation as the public feel he has been made a scapegoat by the Government while the FA offices in Sofia were raided by police on Tuesday. Mihaylov was the man who appointed Balakov.\n\nThat highlights that some fans still believe the problems surrounding the England game have been overblown and they do not want Mihaylov to quit.\n\nMeanwhile, five Bulgarian football fans suspected of racially abusing England players have been arrested. Bulgaria's Ministry of the Interior said: \u201cWork is still ongoing to identify others.\u201d", "description": "Ex-World Cup star Balakov refused on the night to accept that he had heard any racist abuse when quizzed by Mirror Sport", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Eddie Keogh For The Fa Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581067.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bulgaria-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifying-Group-A-Vasil-Levski-National-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
