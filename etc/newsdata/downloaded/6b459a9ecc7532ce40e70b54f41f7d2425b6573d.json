Would it be a better place? A more human place? Or would it be something different than the founders imagined America to be?\u201d\n\nMr. Severino said under the Trump administration, he can \u201cimagine a world in the future that is very different than John Lennon\u2019s.\u201d It\u2019s also a world very different from the Obama administration\u2019s.\n\nThe Obama administration averaged 1.25 violation of conscience complaints per year at HHS. Mr. Severino\u2019s office processed 343 complaints charging a violation of conscience last fiscal year, he said.\n\nThe goal now, he said, it to ensure that religious liberty protections do not disappear under the next administration, whether that be one or five years from now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of institutionalizing these protections,\u201d said Mr. Severino, invoking Manifest Destiny. \u201cLook, we may be heading to different directions on the edges, but on civil rights, we\u2019re headed westward,\u201d he said, acknowledging it could be \u201csouthwest\u201d or \u201cnorthwest.\u201d\n\nTwo years after then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a 20-point guidance on religious liberty for all executive branch employees, lawyers inside the Trump administration have taken rapid steps to ensure a person with deeply held religious beliefs is viewed with the same protected status as someone who is a racial minority or vulnerable to sex discrimination.\n\nThey have frequently invoked two religious liberty laws in state and federal cases. They have used the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, say, to protect an American Indian tribe\u2019s use of private property to conduct ceremonial sweats, and 1993\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed by President Clinton and introduced by then-Rep. Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, to protect employers from federal mandates requiring them to provide birth control to employees based on the employer\u2019s deeply held religious beliefs.\n\nLiberal critics have pushed back against that expansion, suggesting religious convictions don\u2019t necessarily equate conservative social values and pointing out that the LGBTQ community could be discriminated against in the name of religious liberty.\n\nJocelyn Samuels, director of UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute, which researches public policy issues related to gender identity and sexual orientation, told The Atlantic in May that for many in the LGBTQ community, the ramping-up of violation-of-conscience exemptions is \u201clikely to significantly reduce access to care.\u201d She was Mr. Severino\u2019s predecessor in the Obama administration.\n\nUnder the direction of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Reed M. Rubinstein, the department\u2019s acting general counsel, said he has focused his office\u2019s attention on religious liberty on college campuses as well as on third-party organizations that might deny vital accreditation to a college because, he hypothesized, a Christian school does not recognize same-sex marriages as valid under its faith-based mission.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear that the religious mission must be taken into account,\u201d Mr. Rubinstein said.\n\nHe also said the department aims to introduce rules \u201cvery, very soon\u201d that would allow for students who intern or work for religious organizations to be eligible for loan forgiveness programs.\n\n\u201cThese are all technical changes, but they\u2019ll all have a significant, cumulative effect that\u2019ll advance religious liberty on college campuses,\u201d Mr. Rubinstein said.\n\nEric Dreiband, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, said his office has heard criticism from Congress and internally about a recent statement of interest filed by the Department of Justice to support the Indianapolis Roman Catholic Archdiocese in its firing of a gay teacher.\n\nThe former teacher at Cathedral High School is suing the diocese after Archbishop Charles Thompson pressured parochial schools to fire LGBTQ staff. Mr. Dreiband said the archdiocese merely wants control over the definition of a Catholic school.\n\n\u201cSometimes our career attorneys and other staff may disagree with positions we\u2019re taking on issues, but they\u2019re professionals, and they do their duty,\u201d Mr. Dreiband said.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s departure from its predecessors has drawn criticism in the Democrat-led House, which performs regular oversight.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard too much from Capitol Hill,\u201d Mr. Dreiband joked before acknowledging a back-and-forth with one congressman who accused him of hostility toward civil rights at a hearing in March.\n\nAt the hearing, Democratic Reps. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania and Ed Case of Hawaii cited a report showing a 60% drop in civil rights prosecutions than under the Obama administration and 50% fewer processed cases than under President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cI said such a statement was inaccurate and offensive,\u201d Mr. Dreiband said Tuesday.\n\nMr. Rubenstein said education should be left to state and local governments in answering a question about California\u2019s sexual health education program, in which teachers are encouraged to discuss family planning and sexual behavior frankly and in earlier grades.\n\n\u201cWhat goes on in local, K-12 schools with respect to curriculum is a local matter, and the federal government should not be involved,\u201d Mr. Rubinstein said.\n\nHe noted that Mrs. Devos has championed school reform that would boost students\u2019 access to scholarships that fund charter schools. \u201cBut at the end of the day, what goes on in California or New Jersey has to be first and foremost the responsibility of the parents who are sending their children there.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
