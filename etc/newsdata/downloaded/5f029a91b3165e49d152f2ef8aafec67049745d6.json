REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency cannot be allowed to operate in Europe while concerns persist about sovereignty, systemic financial risks and the risk of abuses by a dominant market player, France\u2019s finance minister said on Thursday.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest social media network announced plans in June to launch the new currency as it expands into e-commerce but Libra has come under fire from regulators around the world who fear it could destabilize the global financial system.\n\nThe minister, Bruno Le Maire, did not spell out how France could keep Libra out of the 28-member European Union.\n\nHe also said he had been in touch with both the incoming and outgoing heads of the European Central Bank about setting up a \u201cpublic digital currency\u201d under the aegis of international financial institutions.\n\nTalking about the Libra project at a meeting of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris, Le Maire said: \u201cThis eventual privatization of money contains risks of abuse of dominant position, risks to sovereignty, and risks for consumers and for companies.\u201d\n\nThe Group of Seven advanced economies warned in July that it would not let Libra proceed until all regulatory concerns have been addressed, saying that a prolonged discussion over the project may first be required.\n\n\u201cLibra also represents a systemic risk from the moment when you have two billion users. Any breakdown in the functioning of this currency, in the management of its reserves, could create considerable financial disruption,\u201d Le Maire said.\n\n\u201cAll these concerns about Libra are serious. I therefore want to say with plenty of clarity: in these conditions we cannot authorize the development of Libra on European soil.\u201d\n\nIn another setback this week for Libra, Switzerland said the proposed payments system could face strict rules that typically apply to banks, on top of tough anti-money laundering laws.", "description": "Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency cannot be allowed to operate in Europe while concerns persist about sovereignty, systemic financial risks and the risk of abuses by a dominant market player, France's finance minister said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429015945&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0NA", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
