(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nIt\u2019s a good rule never to start a fight you\u2019re not eager to finish. But the Trump administration and its Arab allies now seem caught in a version of that dilemma with Iran, which is proving to be a tougher adversary than Washington expected.\n\nIran\u2019s alleged attack last Saturday on Saudi oil facilities caught U.S. analysts by surprise. It was a major strike, using a combined force of 25 Iranian ballistic missiles and drones, according to Saudi officials, against assets that were supposedly protected by U.S. and Saudi defensive weapons.\n\nFor U.S. officials, one message is that the Iranians are much more militant and risk-tolerant than American analysts had believed. Another is that the Iranians have correctly assessed that President Trump doesn\u2019t want war and are taking advantage of that perceived weakness. The more Trump talks about his desire for a diplomatic solution, the more Iran seems ready to attack. That\u2019s a dangerous dynamic.\n\nThe United States has enormous military power in the Persian Gulf, enough to obliterate Iran many times over. But the unpleasant fact is that Iran hasn\u2019t been deterred by this force. That\u2019s a situation strategic planners dread, because it can drive a nation toward conflict simply to demonstrate its credibility and avoid a larger battle.\n\nU.S. officials describe Iran\u2019s denials of responsibility for the Saudi strike as baldfaced lies. They say intelligence leaves no doubt the attacks originated inside Iran, though officials are wary of revealing publicly how much they know about Iranian operations. Col. Turki al-Malki, a Saudi military spokesman, said bluntly Wednesday, in displaying fragments of Iranian munitions: \u201cThe attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran.\u201d\n\nThe attack on the Saudi refinery at Abqaiq was a potential game changer for oil markets. It showed the vulnerability of energy infrastructure \u2014 not just in Saudi Arabia but also among its gulf neighbors: Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. These countries have made huge investments in U.S. military systems that, it turns out, leave them vulnerable.\n\nEnergy analysts must assume that such an attack could happen again, against multiple targets, unless the United States launches retaliatory strikes that would themselves pose big risks for gulf energy shipments. Thus, upward pressure on oil prices could continue for months and maybe years \u2014 not the message Trump wants as he prepares for an election year.\n\nBut for Trump, this is a self-inflicted wound. As the confrontation escalates, it\u2019s important to remember that it was entirely unnecessary.\n\nTrump chose to abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, against the advice of most of his allies and many of his senior aides, and despite Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal. He apparently wanted a bigger, better deal that would outdo President Barack Obama\u2019s version. And he seemed certain that if he applied \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d through economic sanctions, Iran would come to the table.\n\nInstead, starting in May, Iran launched an escalating campaign against Saudi and UAE oil targets. With Trump\u2019s blessing, the United States adopted a low-key response. Even after Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in June, Trump personally decided against a military response.\n\nSome national security officials worried that this reticence might weaken deterrence, but Trump wanted to avoid war. He understood that another major conflict in the Middle East would be a political disaster, especially in defense of a Saudi Arabia that\u2019s unpopular with many in Congress.\n\nTrump has continued to seek talks with Iran, despite warnings from some analysts that Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, would refuse. Trump encouraged mediation efforts by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and French President Emmanuel Macron, but those were spurned by Tehran, as was Trump\u2019s suggestion of a meeting this month in New York with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nAgainst a cocky Iran, the Trump administration continues its relatively soft line. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that last Saturday\u2019s attacks were an \u201cact of war.\u201d But Thursday, he blandly countered Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2019s threat of \u201call-out war\u201d against any retaliation with the assurance that his goal was \u201cachieving peace and peaceful resolution.\u201d\n\nThe Iran confrontation converges on three painful realities: Iran is now a full-fledged menace to security and oil shipments in the region; any military action against Iran must include some Saudi forces for it to be politically acceptable in the United States; Saudis and Emiratis, seeing anew their vulnerability, are wary of open conflict.\n\nThis dangerous chain of events was predictable \u2014 and indeed, predicted. Now Trump must decide whether to fight a war he and the country don\u2019t want, or to accommodate an Iran whose truculence he helped create.
