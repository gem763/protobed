(AP) \u2014 The American Civil Liberties Union is demanding that the federal government return a Salvadoran man to the United States after he was deported despite a court order allowing him to remain here.\n\nIn its brief filed Wednesday, the ACLU of New Hampshire said that Jos\u00e9 Daniel Guerra-Casta\u00f1eda was deported last month by U.S. Immigration and Enforcement to El Salvador and is in a crowded jail there.\n\nA federal judge in Boston ruled last month that Guerra-Casta\u00f1eda could remain in the United States to fight deportation efforts over an alleged murder he committed in El Salvador. Guerra-Casta\u00f1eda, who was living in Massachusetts, was detained in New Hampshire, has argued he would face \u201cpersecution and torture\u201d in El Salvador\n\nThe ACLU said Guerra-Casta\u00f1eda had been sent to a detention center in Louisiana ahead of his pending deportation. After the court ruling, court records show ICE officials in Boston sent an email to their colleagues in Louisiana advising them that Guerra-Casta\u00f1eda should not be deported\n\nDespite that correspondence, the ACLU said he was deported on Sept. 13, two days after the second of two court orders staying his deportation\n\n\u201cNo one is above the law, and when the court issues an order, we are all bound to uphold it\u2014especially the United States government,\u201d said Gilles Bissonnette, legal director at the ACLU of New Hampshire. \u201cNo human being should be sent by the United States to a country where they will be tortured or persecuted before they ever have an opportunity to challenge their removal.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU wants the federal government to return Guerra-Casta\u00f1eda to the United States, where he was fighting deportation over alleged crimes committed in El Salvador.\n\nIf he is not returned, the ACLU wants the government held in contempt and fined $1,000 a day. In the court filings, the ACLU said that ICE had indicated it was seeking information about Guerra-Casta\u00f1eda including the status of his criminal case and the possibility of returning him to the United States. But ICE also said it lacked the resources to facilitate a return.\n\nA spokesman for ICE said the agency couldn\u2019t comment on the case in \u201clight of the ongoing nature of this litigation.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU said Guerra-Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s case is a part of a trend. Nationwide, it said, it has documented eight cases in which ICE attempted to deport someone after a court ruled the person could stay. In three cases, it said, the person was illegally removed despite a law prohibiting it. In five cases, an immigration lawyer intervened and prevented their deportation.\n\n\u201cThe growing trend of illegal deportations is deeply troubling,\u201d SangYeob Kim, an immigration staff attorney at the ACLU of New Hampshire, said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot, as a matter of principle, let any defiance of a court order go without consequence _ particularly in a case like this where someone may be persecuted or tortured if deported.\u201d", "description": "The American Civil Liberties Union is demanding that the federal government return a Salvadoran man to the United States after he was deported despite a court order allowing him to remain here.
