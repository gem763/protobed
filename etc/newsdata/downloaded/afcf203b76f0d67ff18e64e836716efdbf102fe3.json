She had been in custody since her arrest in July 2018.\n\nIn brief comments to journalists at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport after arriving on an Aeroflot flight from Miami, Butina thanked her supporters. She was carrying a bouquet of flowers and rested her head on the shoulder of her father, Valery, who had come from their Siberian hometown of Barnaul to meet her.\n\n\u201cI am very, very, very happy to be back home. I am very grateful to everyone who supported me \u2014 all the Russian citizens who helped and wrote me letters and donated money for my defense,\u201d she said.\n\nThe former American University graduate student pleaded guilty last December to conspiring to act as an unregistered agent for Russia. She admitted that she and a former Russian lawmaker worked to leverage contacts in the National Rifle Association to pursue back channels to American conservatives.\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman, who also met Butina at the airport, said the 30-year-old is a victim of entrenched anti-Russian attitudes.\n\n\u201cThis is what, unfortunately, the previous U.S. administration started \u2014 trying to destroy the bilateral relationship,\u201d Maria Zakharova said. Since the election of President Donald Trump, Russian officials have consistently blamed troubled relations on so-called \u201cRussophobia\u201d carried over from the administration of President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cShe really did no harm to anybody. She\u2019s just a girl, she\u2019s just a young woman. She tried to invest her youth, if you wish, her gift, her talent, into people-to-people contacts,\u201d Zakharova said.\n\nButina\u2019s case was highly criticized in Russia and the foreign ministry underlined the position by using her face as the avatar on its Facebook page. That was changed to the Russian double-eagle symbol after her return.\n\nButina violated U.S. law because she did not report her efforts to the Justice Department, which requires the registration of lobbyists and others in the U.S. who do the bidding of foreign governments. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison but received credit for time already served.\n\nHer lawyers said Friday that she was not a spy and that the case had nothing to do with espionage or election interference. They cast the crime as more technical than substantive.\n\nThe Butina case captivated public attention in the U.S. because it unfolded around the same time as special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, even though the two probes were entirely separate.\n\nIt also led to scrutiny of the political dealings of the powerful NRA.\n\n___\n\nAlexander Roslyakov in Moscow contributed to this story.", "description": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 The woman convicted of being a covert Russian agent returned to her homeland on Saturday, deported by the United States after serving a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/26/596ed9_russia-covert-agent-77052-russian-agent-maria-butina-holds-bunch-flowers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
