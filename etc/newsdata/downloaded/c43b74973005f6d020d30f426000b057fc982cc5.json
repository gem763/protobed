I drive cars and put them where they need to be.\u201d Photo: Vulture and Paramount Pictures\n\nDespite the fact that they regularly fling their bodies off buildings, crash motorcycles, leap out of planes, and willingly set themselves aflame, stunt performers do not describe themselves as daredevils. They prefer their actual titles: martial artists, gymnasts, precision drivers, action actors. \u201cPeople tell me all the time, \u2018Oh, you must be so brave and fearless,\u2019\u201d says stuntwoman Mahsa Ahmadi. \u201cNo! It\u2019s not about being brave enough to put yourself on fire, it\u2019s about learning and practicing until you can do it safely, be in control.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about hitting marks,\u201d reiterates David Barrett, another humble stuntman (turned director). \u201cYou have to move like the actor you\u2019re doubling, and the better chameleon you are \u2014 the better actor you are \u2014 the more effective you are to tell that story.\u201d\n\nAhmadi will surely forgive us for stating the truth: Stunt work began with fearless daredevils. In the early days of film, if a director needed someone to jump off a cliff or fall out a window, they\u2019d simply find someone brave or desperate enough to do it. Guinness World Records says the first person hired specifically to do a stunt was Frank Hanaway, whose claim to fame in 1903\u2019s The Great Train Robbery was his ability to fall off a horse at speed. Stunt work was a big part of early silent comedy too, with actors like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin using physical gags instead of audible punchlines to land a joke. By the mid-1920s, movie houses began seriously worrying about the well-being of their stars, and so it became more common to substitute a stuntman for the lead actor in risky shots. As silent films gave way to swashbuckling adventures and Western action flicks, a community grew around the performers who could fight and fall, swing through riggings, and ride a horse while shooting a gun.\n\nModern stunt work started in the 1960s, when many of the cowboy stuntmen turned to horsepower of a different sort, prompting the car-chase movie to replace the Western. In the 1970s, stunts from other countries began to find an audience in America too, as Hollywood integrated martial arts into its fight scenes and added Japanese-inspired drifting to its car chases. Developments in special effects came later, changing the landscape for stunt performers, but in no way replacing them. \u201cYou don\u2019t need hundreds of stuntpeople working on the set with you anymore,\u201d says stunt coordinator Jack Gill. \u201cWhen I got in the business, you\u2019d need 100 stuntpeople for a big Western or war scene. Nowadays with CGI, you can create that. You can bring in 30 to 40 people and create the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s offset,\u201d he adds, \u201cbecause instead of there being maybe 30 or 40 projects to work on, there are thousands, and there are jobs all over the world.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of drifting, the biggest difference stunt performers identify in their industry today is a trend toward hyper-specialization. \u201cEverybody\u2019s gotten so much better at specific things,\u201d said David Barrett. \u201cEverybody has a real specialty. Now there are world-class athletes in each category.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a bit unusual to be \u2018just\u2019 a car person,\u201d said stunt driver Sera Trimble. \u201cBut I don\u2019t do falls. I don\u2019t do fire. I drive cars and put them where they need to be.\u201d\n\nHere, eight stunt specialists explain some of the hardest days of their career so far:\n\nTransformers (2007), the old Camaro scene\n\nJames Smith, stunt driver: One of my most challenging [stunts] was skiing the Bumblebee on two wheels through the tunnel on Second Street in Los Angeles for Transformers. The asphalt in tunnels isn\u2019t as smooth as on a regular street because the paving companies can\u2019t get all their equipment in there. So it\u2019s always rougher in a tunnel.\n\nThe scene was to have the old Camaro on two wheels \u2026 In an older car, the suspension can be a little wonky, and I\u2019ve got to get that car tipped up to the point that it\u2019ll drive while my other door\u2019s almost rubbing the ground. But then the ground is all uneven, and I\u2019m trying to navigate that car with the mirror all but rubbing the pavement. Trying not to wreck it but also trying to steer it.\n\nTo get the car up on two wheels, you drive it off a ramp, and when you hit the ramp and the car comes up, it\u2019s not all the way on its balance point. When you come off the ramp it\u2019s still in a turn. So until I get it to the balance point, I\u2019m still turning. When you\u2019re up at the skiing point where the car isn\u2019t balancing, your eyes look out and see the horizon all sideways and your mind has to say, Yep, that\u2019s normal. So there I was, in the tunnel, looking at a concrete wall sideways right in front of me, trying to decide if I should keep going and try to turn it the other way or crash into the wall and make everybody mad at me. I think it took four tries to get it, an hour or two. These days I could whip it out in 20 minutes, but 13, 15 years ago, I wasn\u2019t that experienced. I was embarrassed that it took me that long, wasting Michael Bay\u2019s time. I was so stressed.\n\nSuicide Squad (2017), doubling Margot Robbie\n\nMelissa Stubbs, stunt coordinator: Something that sticks in my mind is Suicide Squad, doubling Margot Robbie. The scene is, they wanted her to crash a motorcycle to get the Joker\u2019s attention because she\u2019s in love with him, and he\u2019s in a Lamborghini. I said there\u2019s nothing sexy or graceful about crashing a motorcycle. It\u2019s just a hot mess. I said, \u201cHow about she lays it down kind of coollike and then gracefully steps on top of it, and surfs the bike to a stop while it\u2019s on the ground?\u201d They were, \u201cOh, that\u2019s awesome, can you do that?\u201d And I\u2019m like \u201cWell, I\u2019ve never done it but I think I can do it. I feel like I can.\u201d\n\nIt took a bunch of rehearsals and figuring things out, and a bunch of failures, high-sided bikes and wrecking a bunch of Harley Davidsons, but I worked it out and it was like, Okay, that\u2019s awesome, yeah. It was tricky. It took a lot of different motorcycle skills, and experience, and not folding under pressure, and just knowing and believing you can do something in order to get it, and we eventually got it.\n\nThe Exterminator (1980), a \u201cbig fireball explosion\u201d followed by a 65-foot leap off a cliff\n\nJack Gill; action designer, 2nd unit director, stunt coordinator, and stuntman: When I was just starting out as a stuntperson, I had this one stunt that came up that five other or six other stuntpeople had turned down. What the director wanted was their lead actor running on the top of a cliff, and an airplane comes in behind him at night and drops a napalm run \u2014 which is a fireball bomb \u2014 that hits behind him. The director said, \u201cI want the stunt double to get propelled off the end of this 65-foot cliff and land on the ground.\u201d\n\nEverybody had turned it down, and when they contacted me, I said, \u201cLook, let\u2019s try and figure it out.\u201d At the time, I wasn\u2019t really thinking of doing it. I was just wanting to know if I could really figure it out. I thought, I could do this on flat ground, so maybe. That\u2019s kind of how it started. But once I got to the site and looked at it, it was a real 65 feet down to any flat ground and it was 22 feet out just to get to the first place where you could put an airbag. Nobody I knew of had ever jumped that far off a cliff to land on an airbag that was 22 feet out.\n\nWe brought in this thing called an air ram. An air ram is like a gymnastic beat board, but instead of having springs, it has these cylinders that are propelled by air. The air springs you up in the air and throws you out and away from the cliff. This was kind of a new device at the time we were doing this, but I had been using the thing for about eight months and was pretty good on it. I said, \u201cIf I could put an air ram on the end of the cliff, when you guys key the big fireball explosion, this should blow me off the top of the cliff and get me far enough out to land on the airbag.\u201d In my mind, it was still pretty dangerous. You can\u2019t miss the airbag because you\u2019re going to die. Even if you land on a piece of the airbag, it\u2019s still going kill you from 65 feet. We practiced on the ground and I did it five, six times and was able to get to 22 feet. So I said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s line it all up.\u201d\n\nOnce we lined it all up, the director said, \u201cWell, along with the 13 gallons of gasoline that are going off behind you, I want to put another eight-gallon pod in the side of the cliff that blows out toward the camera. Are you okay with that?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, as long as you can keep it away from me and I don\u2019t go through it, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nSo we get on the top of the cliff, and it\u2019s nighttime, and we start to set this all up. I said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s try and do this on flat ground again, just to make sure that I\u2019m all tuned up and I\u2019m all ready to do this.\u201d I do it once and then I do it twice on flat ground, and it all works. But the third time the air ram misfires. It doesn\u2019t go off. I turned to the special-effects guy and I said, \u201cIf my air ram doesn\u2019t fire, are you still keying the explosions?\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, the explosions are keyed off when your foot touches that air ram.\u201d\n\nI tried it again and the air ram misfired. So I told the guy that owned the air ram, \u201cI\u2019m not doing this. Let\u2019s call it off.\u201d He said, \u201cI think I can go get you another air ram.\u201d Now it\u2019s probably 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. He loads up his truck and he goes all the way back to Burbank from Valencia, California, which is an hour-and-a-half drive, picks up another air ram, gets all the way back to us at about 4 in the morning, loads in another air ram. I do it four times on flat ground. It fires every single time.\n\nI said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s not disconnect or move anything.\u201d Five guys picked everything up and put it on the end of the cliff, and I went out there, did the fireball explosion, landed in the airbag fine and everything was great. I would never do that one again and I would never ask anybody else to do something like that again. In today\u2019s world, we would do it with a much smaller explosion and enhance the fire in the background with CGI, and also put the guy on a cable so he can never really hit the ground. Back then, we didn\u2019t have the safety. The way we did it was the only way to do it.\n\nSpeed 2 (1997), a Ducati lay-down\n\nDavid Barrett, stuntman and co-executive producer of Blue Bloods: I had to do a lay-down on a 916 Ducati for Speed 2 and [director] Jan de Bont didn\u2019t want me to have a helmet. I mean, the character didn\u2019t. And I had to be in a short-sleeve shirt. The stunt was to lay it down in front of an oncoming bread truck going uphill on pavement. That was a tough one because I knew I was going to get scraped up, and in a stunt like that, you don\u2019t want to hit your head, obviously.\n\nAside from not wanting to hit my head, with a motorcycle stunt, it\u2019s really making sure your hands don\u2019t get caught. So you put your thumbs on the grips and it\u2019s a one-two-three beat. First, hit the back brake. Two, you slam the motorcycle to the ground, and three you push off from it.\n\nI knew that I was going to have my arms exposed and my head exposed. I could put a pad on my hip and I put a little pad on the top of my left elbow. I was paying a lot of attention when I went down that I hit those two spots! If you hit the right spots you tear up the pads and your wardrobe. If not, you\u2019re gonna hurt for a while.\n\nWe did it once, and I told Jan de Bont I could do a better job. I could get it a little closer to the bread truck. He said, \u201cAre you crazy? That was good. We can move on.\u201d We did it again, and yeah, I was a little cut up afterwards, but at a certain point it becomes your brand. This is my product. That pain lasts a few days maybe. That film clip lasts forever.\n\nThe Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), a Tokyo Drift\n\nRhys Millen, stunt driver: One that stands out would be a Tokyo Drift, where we had a spiral parking structure and we had to slide up it and I was doubling the Drift King in his car. I thought that it was going to be easy. Once we started, I understood that I had maybe oversold what could be done. But we pulled it off. It took three takes. The second one was a little too overconfident, then I had to bail out on it. But take one and take two, I got it. It made it in the movie.\n\nPhoto: Universal Pictures\n\nThe reason it was so hard was that the entry point [of the parking structure] was very, very narrow with a curb sticking out. You couldn\u2019t fluidly hit the angle and change the motion of the car, you had to come into the shot already in position, because as soon as the car appeared, it needed to be into its performance angle. Then the whole way up, the right front tire was scraping the curb and the left rear bodywork was scraping the wall. The commitment had to be there. That one stands out not only to me, but the audience latched onto it as well.\n\nThe Cookout (2004), a high fall through a skylight\n\nCheryl Lewis, stunt performer: One of my favorite film stunts was a high fall through a skylight, for The Cookout. It was one of my first big stunt jobs in a film. Queen Latifah was in it, and I was doubling her. I\u2019m not her usual double, but she was working on two films at the same time, and the schedules were overlapping, so they called me in.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Cheryl Lewis\n\nThey built a mockup of the house because they were on location at somebody\u2019s actual house, so they couldn\u2019t just smash through the real ceiling. In the movie, the character is wearing SWAT gear, so for the stunt I was wearing all that gear. As a gymnast, I have a pretty good sense of my body, and my location in a fall \u2014 we call it \u201cair awareness\u201d \u2014 but if the costume makes you heavier, it makes you fall faster. My job was to time falling through the glass, making sure I passed through the camera frame, before I turned my body into the safe landing position. If I turned too soon, the camera would see I wasn\u2019t Queen Latifah, and if I turned too late I could get hurt.\n\nWhat stuck out to me is that after I did it, one of the crew guys picked up a big chunk of the glass, and came over and said, \u201cThat was so cool, can you sign this piece of glass for me?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ve never signed a piece of wreckage before,\u201d but I gave him my autograph on a piece of the glass that I fell through.\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2019), Captain America vs. Captain America\n\nDaniel Hargrave, stunt performer: I did a couple days on Winter Solider. I went and doubled Chris [Evans] \u2014 that was the first I had ever doubled Chris and my first Marvel movie. I did Winter Soldier and then I was on Captain America: Civil War and then I got to do the additional photography on Thor: Ragnarok, and the last two Avengers.\n\nThe whole [Avengers: Endgame] sequence, honestly, that was kind of [my brother] Sam [Hargrave\u2019s] brainchild. He found out pretty early that there was going to be a pretty cool Captain America vs. Captain America sequence and even during Infinity War he had started brainstorming and thinking up sets, especially adding in all the stairwells and the glass, and the stuff to make it kind of something different \u2014 add a couple stair falls and crashes through glass.\n\nWe had a good amount of time, a couple of weeks, to sit there and come up with the choreography and the gags and think, what\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen? What was something that would really make the audience go \u201cooh\u201d or \u201cwow.\u201d The biggest thing we wanted to show was how Captain America evolved through time. His fighting style, and Sam was playing the newer Captain America and I was playing the younger, from the flashbacks, so my style was a little different from his. He turned a little more Judo and was kind of anticipating the moves \u2014 it was fun, just to sit in there and try to outsmart each other and think of something we hadn\u2019t seen before.\n\nThey did actually cut out a whole fight that happens inside of \u2014 there was this office that we smashed through after the big cat walk. It didn\u2019t fit the scene, or it didn\u2019t fit time-wise.\n\nThe double stair fall, where we just go flying down the stairs together and then we clip off the stairs in the rib \u2026 they built a big platform up top and everyone was watching. Sam and I go, \u201cAlright, here we go,\u201d and I jumped as far I could. I went first and I went slamming and fell off into some boxes. It was pretty amusing to watch two brothers just living it up, acting like kids.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios\n\nSam Hargrave, fight coordinator: We worked really closely with visual FX to design this space. I was with them from conception to building. I said, \u201cYou know, I think this gap should be eight feet rather than 16 feet, because it\u2019s gonna be harder for our stunt guys to get from here to there.\u201d It was a whole amazing experience just from the ground up, literally building this set, designing the action, coming up with the choreography, working with the Russos.\n\nI always try to approach action and fights from a place of character and story, so you gotta find out who\u2019s in the fight, where are they at this point in the story, where have they come from, and where are they going. It\u2019s very similar I think to how I think a director or an actor would approach a scene like that, when you\u2019re choreographing fight. The unique challenge about this was Captain America was fighting himself but from the past, so we have a certain set of skills that we\u2019ve shown in the past that Captain America uses, a skillset that he has, and then how does the older, \u201cwiser\u201d Cap deal with these skillsets.\n\nUsually I\u2019ll work with the writers [on the choreography] and we do just kind of a pass. The guys are really into the story and knowing where these characters are coming and going, what beats do we want to hit? What important character moments do we need to hit along the way? And often times that\u2019s set out in the script already. Then we kind of do a breakdown of that. I really enjoy the energy of other people and the kind of creative flow, the improv. I start with, \u201cOkay, throw a punch, just throw a punch at me.\u201d Then, you know, we\u2019ll trade positions, like, \u201cOkay, now wait I\u2019m going to throw a punch at you,\u201d and then [I] see what he does or she does and whatever they do \u2014 \u201cOh, maybe that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nI mean we were very fortunate at this point that it was almost as if the same person was fighting [in Endgame], because I was fighting my younger brother and we\u2019ve grown up together doing, you know, fight scenes together, playing together, just being around each other our whole lives. But then the, you know, interwoven within that synergy is the relationship that Chris Evans and I have, and now Chris Evans and my brother, Daniel, because he doubled him on Infinity War. We do move almost as one person when we are in the suit, and my brother is very astute at picking up those kinds of things.\n\nChris would do both sides of the fight, so they take his face elements from one side and put it on one of us, my brother or I. So it\u2019s Chris fighting me at some points, it\u2019s Chris fighting my brother at some points, but then for the audience, it\u2019s always Chris fighting Chris. It\u2019s always Captain America fighting Captain America. It\u2019s a very complicated fight sequence but I think all the math and science paid off in the end with a really exciting sequence.\n\nWith additional reporting from Tolly Wright.\n\nFor any other stunt performers who have a great hardest stunt story to share, let us know at stories@vulture.com.", "description": "Stunt drivers and performers recall their toughest days on the job \u2014 and why they never want to waste Michael Bay\u2019s time.", "authors": ["Elana Scherr"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/how-it-works-stunts/12-how-it-works-stunts.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
