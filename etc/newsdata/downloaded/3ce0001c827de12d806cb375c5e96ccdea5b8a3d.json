But if your college freshman comes home for Thanksgiving Break and you no longer recognize the person you dropped off just three months prior, that excitement may turn to shock, or even anger.\n\nSure, Tommy might have learned some valuable concepts in chemistry, literature, and history. But he may also have learned identity politics, that most people are racist, and to blame America for most of the world\u2019s problems \u2013 from \u201cclimate change\u201d to wars to depleting too many natural resources. Perhaps you\u2019ll hear him telling his friends how he now hates capitalism and how we would all fare better under socialism.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that colleges have been bastions of liberalism for years, but with the rising acceptance of socialism and \u201csocial justice\u201d in America, campuses have become ground zero for truly radical socialist indoctrination.\n\nEven the best of parents who taught their kids to be critical thinkers can be shocked when those kids come home after months of leftist programming. Some young people are able to resist the pressure to conform, but others can\u2019t. For many students, college can mean that they\u2019re the targets of speech codes, bullying by other students, and intimidation by professors. Many times, campus administrators just stand by silently, or worse, enforce the radicalism.\n\nIt\u2019s healthy for students to be challenged at college and be exposed to new ideas. What\u2019s not healthy is to be berated, intimidated, or coerced into adopting an ideology that goes against their very core principles.\n\nRecently, a friend of mine accompanied her son to freshman orientation at a state university. During the orientation, she and other parents grew increasingly uncomfortable as several campus speakers got up and introduced themselves not only by their names and titles but also by the pronouns that they preferred to be called. She noticed that the new students\u2019 nametags also listed their preferred pronouns. This was an effort to accommodate those students who were transgender, undecided about their gender, or \u201cfluid\u201d between genders.\n\nShe was so shocked by what she saw that she wrote an article about it to try to warn other parents. She made it clear that she wasn\u2019t casting aspersions on transgendered people and felt compassion for those with gender dysphoria. Rather, she was calling out university officials for pushing what they knew was a highly charged issue on an entire new class of students.\n\nIn response, the far-left began assailing her and her son with hateful and violent threats, posted her son\u2019s name and photo on social media, and threatened to bully him on campus.\n\nRecent polling by the Knight Foundation shows that more than two-thirds of college students \u2013 including both Democratic- and Republican-leaning students \u2013 say the campus climate prevents them from expressing their true opinions for fear of offending their classmates. This polling reinforces what many people already knew: that it\u2019s a minority on campus, enabled by faculty and administrators, who are creating this environment for everyone else.\n\nThe polling also shows that, despite the fact that so many students feel they can\u2019t speak up, 46 percent are still inclined to eliminate free speech on campus in favor of promoting an \u201cinclusive and welcoming society.\u201d That\u2019s a frightening statistic. Contrary to the claims of the far-left, that doesn\u2019t promote an open-minded learning environment, but rather conformity to the most radical tenets of leftism.\n\nGoing to college has such an incredible impact on our children\u2019s futures that each time I found out I was pregnant, it was one of the things I prayed for on behalf of my children. I prayed that they would attend colleges that could help them open the doors to knowledge, grow as people, and prepare for fulfilling careers.\n\nEven back then, I didn\u2019t understand the degree of influence someone\u2019s choice of college would have in his or her life. Over 40 years later, in today\u2019s society, that influence is even more dramatic. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t just sit on our hands and let this indoctrination and bullying continue.\n\nAs parents and taxpayers who are turning our kids over to these schools and paying the lion\u2019s share of college costs, it\u2019s incumbent upon us to contact our legislators and school administrators and demand better of these institutions \u2013 not only for the benefit of our students and their education, but for the very future of our civil society.", "description": "Back-to-school on America\u2019s\u00a0college campuses\u00a0can be an exciting time for parents and students alike.
