To recreate that taste, this recipe is made with garlic powder instead of garlic, dried parsley instead of fresh, and so on. It makes enough seasoning mix for about 4 cups dressing; you can mix it, store it, then add dairy as needed. If you don\u2019t like the zip of mustard, try hot sauce or Worcestershire sauce instead \u2014 or simply omit for a milder taste. To make a thick dip instead of a pourable dressing, reduce the amount of buttermilk to 1/4 cup.\n\nFeatured in: Ranch Nation.", "description": "The original dressing served in the 1950s at Hidden Valley Ranch, a guest ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif., was made mostly from dry herbs and aromatics To recreate that taste, this recipe is made with garlic powder instead of garlic, dried parsley instead of fresh, and so on It makes enough seasoning mix for about 4 cups dressing; you can mix it, store it, then add dairy as needed", "authors": ["Julia Moskin", "Marian Burros", "Sam Sifton", "David Tanis", "Samantha Seneviratne", "Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/19/dining/19Ranchrex1/merlin_143599344_42942a8a-c6d8-4825-988c-5066d7be73f4-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-19"}
