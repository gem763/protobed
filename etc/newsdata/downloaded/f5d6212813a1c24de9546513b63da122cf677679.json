There\u2019s one spotlight on the stage, it\u2019s shining on Trump, and you\u2019re a prop in the back with dim lights.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s desires for his advisers range from the trivial \u2014 someone who looks the part \u2014 to the traditional \u2014 someone willing to vigorously support him and defend his policies in media appearances. But these demands can be grating and at times terminal for members of his staff \u2014 especially for those who, like the national security adviser, may find themselves at odds with the president on critical issues.\n\n\u201cThere is no person that is part of the daily Trump decision-making process that can survive long term,\u201d said a former senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t like people to get good press. He doesn\u2019t like people to get bad press. Yet he expects everyone to be relevant and important and supportive at all times. Even if a person could do all those things, the president would grow tired of anyone in his immediate orbit.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Beta.Washingtonpost.Com Politics Youre-A-Prop-In-The-Back-Advisers-Struggle-To-Obey-Trumps-Kafkaesque-Rules"], "top_image": ""}
