(CBC News/CBC Archives)\n\n\"There's a big difference of, say, going into a ladies' store than going into the Tiger-Cats dressing room after a game,\" said Williams. \"You know, seeing [football player] Angelo Mosca in the suit he was born in.\"\n\nAs editor, Williams worked alongside six women to put together the section which, Casey said, tried to be \"interesting to everyone.\"\n\n\"He's tackled such subjects as mini-skirts, alcoholic housewives, the Pill, deserted husbands and prostitution,\" said Casey.\n\nWhen offered the job, Williams didn't hesitate despite the drawbacks.\n\n\"He's lived down the snickers of the rest of the boys, who presented him with the keys to the women's washroom when he got the job,\" noted Casey.\n\n'I think it's improved'\n\nPart of the job for Williams involved staying up to date on women's fashions, but he said he tried to make the women's section interesting to everyone. (CBC News/CBC Archives)\n\nAnd sometimes Williams had to \"submerge\" his own personal tastes to give way to what women wanted.\n\nPantsuits, for example, were something he didn't favour but featured in the newspaper because they were popular with his readers.\n\nAnd his readers weren't all women.\n\n\"I've never read a ladies' page in my life, but since you've been involved in it I find myself glancing at it,\" Williams's friend Ralph Sazio, general manager of the Tiger-Cats, told him. \"I think it's improved.\"\n\nAnd Williams said taking on the job as women's page editor had changed his attitude to women.\n\n\"They're not to be treated as unequal,\" he said. \"They can do as much as a man.\"", "description": "In 1969, Barrie Williams was celebrating a year on the job as editor of the women's pages at the Hamilton Spectator.", "authors": ["Cbc Archives"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5256472.1566501179!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/barrie-williams.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
