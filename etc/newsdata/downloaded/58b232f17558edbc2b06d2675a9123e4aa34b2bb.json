Now, Russian military police have unrestrained access to hundreds of kilometers of NATO's southern border, at the invitation of a NATO member,\" CNN's Nick Paton Walsh wrote on Wednesday.\n\n\"That is something Vladimir Putin can only have dreamed of.\"\n\nMap showing Europe and Russia, and Turkey acting as a buffer between them. Google Maps/Business Insider\n\nPutin's expansion into Africa \u2014 highlighted in this week's first Russia-Africa Summit \u2014 has shown to the world a desire to cement his economic influence beyond his immediate surroundings. The Soviet Union used to have a major presence on the continent, but that has decreased since the end of the Cold War.\n\n\"Whether it's through diamond extraction or arms sales in Madagascar, or energy deals in Nigeria or Libya, the Russians are [showing themselves to be] an increasing force to be reckoned with,\" said James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House.\n\nRussia has also staged brazen attacks in Western countries in recent years, notably a daylight killing of a former Chechen rebel in Berlin this August and the botched poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England, last year.\n\nThough the Kremlin has denied ordering either attack, observers say the hallmarks of a Russian operation in both cases are unmistakable \u2014 and indeed so blatant as to suggest Putin has little desire to cover his tracks.\n\nPutin waves during a family photo with heads of African countries at the 2019 Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi on October 24, 2019.

The Russian economy is still floundering under those sanctions, though the financial pain has done little to restrain it overseas.\n\nRussian troops guard a military base in Perevalnoye, Crimea, in March 2014. Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters\n\nPutin is trying to establish a great power. Trump seems fine with that.\n\nPutin has long tried to cement Russia's position a superpower, and Trump has made it startlingly easy for him, Nixey said.\n\nTrump \"doesn't really care what the consequences there are regionally [in Syria] because he's more interested in what it means for the US,\" Nixey told Business Insider.\n\n\"He doesn't regard the Russian intervention as being a bad thing or a good thing particularly, but it doesn't matter as long as he's out.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he said, \"it makes Russia look like a major world power on the world stage. Secondly, it gives Russia a foot in the door for future energy contracts, both flows of energy from the region and assistance to the region: arms, energy, etc. Never forget the economic motive: it's always there for Russia as well.\"\n\nRussian forces patrol near the city of Qamishli, north Syria, on October 24, 2019. Associated Press\n\nShortly after Trump announced his withdrawal from northeastern Syria, Russian journalists described it as an \"unexpected 'lottery win'\" for Putin, journalist Julia Davis reported for The Daily Beast.\n\nMaksim Yusin, an editor at the independent Kommersant newspaper even joked, according to Davis: \"I've been watching Trump's behavior lately and get seditious thoughts: maybe he really is a Russian agent? He is laboring so hard to strengthen the international image of Russia in general.\"\n\nAs American troops pulled out of Syria this month, a Western military official from the anti-ISIS coalition in Syria also told Business Insider's Mitch Prothero: \"Putin likely can't believe his luck.\"\n\nPutin and US President Donald Trump at the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, in June 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nTrump has also taken considerable steps to welcome Putin back onto the world stage, erasing his predecessor Barack Obama's moves to freeze him out.\n\nTrump has demonstrably weakened his focus on providing military aid for Ukraine \u2014 which the US ramped up in 2014 after the Crimea annexation \u2014 since diplomats revealed that Trump threatened to freeze military aid in exchange for dirt on his Democratic rival Joe Biden earlier this year.\n\nDuring this year's G7 summit, Trump also aggressively lobbied for Russia to be granted re-entry into the group that expelled it over the annexation of Crimea. The state-run Rossiya-1 network reportedly played celebratory music as it reported the news.\n\nOne Republican lawmaker told Business Insider's Sonam Sheth at the time that Trump \"looked like Putin's puppet.\"\n\nThe lawmaker, who spoke anonymously, noted that the move was doubly strange because Trump seemed not to want anything in exchange.\n\nG7 leaders in Biarritz, France, in August 2019.
