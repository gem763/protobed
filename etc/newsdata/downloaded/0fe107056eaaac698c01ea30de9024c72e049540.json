Only out there can you feel the greatness - the huge size of all that surrounds us.\"\n\nAs he pushed himself away from the spacecraft, he went into a spin until he was pulled to a stop by a 16ft cord that was tethered to an airlock to prevent him from floating away.\n\nBut when it was time to return his suit had inflated and he was just minutes away from being plunged into total darkness in the Earth's shadow.\n\nMr Leonov told the BBC in 2014: \"My suit was becoming deformed, my hands had slipped out of the gloves, my feet came out of the boots. The suit felt loose around my body. I had to do something.\"\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t pull myself back using the cord. And what\u2019s more with this misshapen suit it would be impossible to fit through the airlock.\"\n\nHe didn't tell space control as he let half the air out of his suit through a valve in its lining, a move that could have starved him of oxygen, to get back inside and avoid certain death.\n\nWhen it was time to return to Earth hours later, the automatic re-entry rockets failed, meaning they had to be fired manually for the first time and precisely so that the craft didn't disintegrate.\n\nHis spacewalk was a huge victory for the USSR in the Space Race at the height of the Cold War.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nBut the real story - including the dangers the crew faced - didn't emerge until years later.\n\nMr Leonov, a decorated major general in the Soviet Air Force, later became commander of the Soyuz crew and retired from service in 1992.\n\nWhen he celebrated his 85th birthday in May this year he was recovering from surgery on his leg, according to Russian media.\n\nHe was born in Listvyanka, a village in Siberia, in 1934 and became a fighter pilot in his 20s.\n\nHe was among the original class of 20 cosmonauts along with Yuri Gagarin, who became the first man in space in April 1961.\n\nA funeral is due to take place on Tuesday.\n\nColonel Belyayev, who commanded the first spacewalk in March 1965, died in 1970 of complications following an operation for a stomach ulcer.", "description": "Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov stepped out of the Voskhod 2 spacecraft for a spacewalk that lasted 12 minutes in March 1965", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20559990.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-170985320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
