Naspers will list Prosus - which holds its internet assets including Tencent - in Amsterdam this morning. The group has been valued by Naspers at around R1.5 trillion. Prosus will be Europe\u2019s largest listed global consumer internet company, with more than 1.5 billion customers across 91 markets.\n\n2. Rand is trading at its best level in more than a month - around R14.62/$ this morning, after reaching R15.45 two weeks ago. The currency is getting a boost from expectations that the European Central Bank will cut rates on Thursday, which will make the rand, which earns its investors a fat interest rate, even more appealing.\n\n3.Ratings agency Moody\u2019s sees a \"low likelihood\" of a downgrade in South Africa's credit rating, and expects that government debt will stabilise. The agency's lead analyst for South Africa, Lucie Villa, told a journalist during a press conference at an investment conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday that the country's \"stable outlook provided a low likelihood\" that its credit rating would change. South Africa currently has a Baa3 rating, the last step before \u201cjunk\u201d, with a stable outlook.\n\n4. SA factory output shrank for the second consecutive month in July - it declined 1.1% from a year earlier, compared with a revised 3.6% fall in June. But economists expected an even bigger fall of 1.5%. Output increased 0.4% between June to July.\n\n5. Rand Merchant Investment, which owns almost 90% of OUTsurance, and also has stakes in Discovery (25%) and Momentum Metropolitan (27%) posted a 7% fall in its headline profit on Wednesday. OUTsurance saw a 13% decline in its profit, due in part to low car premium growth.\n\n22 movies we can't wait to see for the rest of the year\n\nThere are well over 50 movies coming to theaters for the rest of the year.\n\nInsider went through the potential blockbusters and award hopefuls coming to theaters from September through the end of the year.\n\nFrom two Stephen King thrillers to Disney's big \"Frozen\" sequel, here's what we're looking forward to this fall.\n\n1. \"It: Chapter Two\"\n\nWhat it's about: The \"It\" sequel takes place 27 years later with Pennywise the Clown returning to prey on the town of Derry, Maine. The members of the Losers' Club reunite to fulfill their promise and take him down once and for all.\n\nWhy to see it: Not only is the original cast back and reprising their roles, but Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, and more are playing the group all grown up. I'm most excited to see Pennywise, a horrifying Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, terrorize and haunt the new cast. If the trailers are any indication of the sequel, it's going to be a scary time. - Kirsten Acuna\n\nWatch the trailer here and read our review here.\n\nRead more: Here's the grown-up cast of 'It: Chapter Two' and who they're playing\n\n2. \"Hustlers\"\n\nWhat it's about: The revenge tale stars Lili Reinhart, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, and Constance Wu - with special appearances from Cardi B and Lizzo - as a group of strippers who team up to take money from privileged Wall Street men.\n\nWhy to see it: If the stacked cast mentioned above didn't already convince you, consider the added intrigue of a real-life inspiration. \"Hustler\" is based on a 2015 New York magazine article called \"The Hustlers at Scores,\" written by Jessica Pressler (whose onscreen counterpart will be played by Julia Stiles). - Callie Ahlgrim\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n3. \"The Goldfinch\"\n\nWhat it's about: Based on Donna Tartt's award-winning novel, \"The Goldfinch\" is a coming-of-age story about a New York City boy whose life is upended when his mother dies, setting off a chain reaction of events that lead him to start making terrible choices as an adult.\n\nWhy to see it: The book is devastatingly beautiful, with memorable characters and dramatic turns in the plot. Starring Angel Elgort, Oakes Fegley, Finn Wolfhard, Nicole Kidman, Jeffrey Wright, Aneurin Barnard, Sarah Paulson, Luke Wilson, and more, early looks at \"The Goldfinch\" make it one of the most promising dramas for the fall season. - Kim Renfro\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n4. \"Ad Astra\"\n\nWhat it's about: Astronaut Roy McBride (played by Brad Pitt) learns that his father (Tommy Lee Jones) isn't dead and has been missing in space. What begins as a mission to save his dad turns into a larger mystery that puts the safety of the planet in his hands.\n\nWhy to see it: In 2017, director James Gray told Collider he wanted to make \"the most realistic depiction of space travel\" you've ever seen in a movie. I'm ready.\n\nThe trailers definitely give me \"Interstellar\" vibes of Matthew McConaughey's character trying save humanity and reconnect with his daughter. \"Ad Astra\" has the potential to be the next big space epic. Donald Sutherland and Liv Tyler also star. - Kirsten Acuna\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n5. \"Downton Abbey\"\n\nWhat it's about: The whole gang is back two years after the finale of the TV series. But everyone is on high alert as the King and Queen are coming to visit.\n\nWhy to see it: As with every season of \"Downton Abbey,\" us fans were willing to follow wherever they wanted to take us. Yes, some surprise deaths tested our loyalty but the true fans continued on. I'm here for the royal visit and all the backstabbing, badmouthing that comes with it. In the end, I know that the upstairs/downstairs will come together in the end. - Jethro Nededog\n\nYou can watch the trailer here.\n\n6. \"Joker\"\n\nWhat it's about: Todd Phillips' DC origin spin-off is centered around Batman's greatest foe, The Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nWhy we're intrigued: If you're worried about whether or not the new Clown Prince of Crime will live up to Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance in \"The Dark Knight,\" you can rest easy. Early reviews for the film are raving over Phoenix's performance as the Joker, with some positioning him, and the movie, for an Oscar nomination.\n\nDon't expect this to be connected to any of the other recent DC movies. The film appears to be set long before Bruce Wayne ever becomes the Caped Crusader as Phoenix's Joker has some beef with Wayne's father, Thomas. If \"Joker\" performs well, maybe it will open the doors for a line of darker standalone WB films. - Kirsten Acuna\n\n7. \"The King\"\n\nWhat it's about: Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet will portray King Henry V, also known as Hal. The story will follow Hal's coronation after his tyrant father's death, and how the young king must learn to navigate the politics that come with the English throne and an ongoing war.\n\nWhy see it: By the looks of the trailer, \"The King\" checks off all the period drama aspects that make them so enticing to watch: Stunning settings, a divisive plot, and amazing costumes. People already can't stop swooning over Chalamet and Robert Pattinson starring in a movie together - with their bold haircuts at the center of attention. - Ang\u00e9lica Acevedo\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n8. \"JoJo Rabbit\"\n\nWhat it's about: Billed as an anti-Hitler satire, \"Jojo Rabbit\" focuses on Jojo, a young boy during WWII who's training with the Hitler youth. Jojo's only companion is his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, and things get complicated when he finds a Jewish girl hidden in his attic.\n\nWhy to see it: Director Taika Waititi is best known for his film \"Thor: Ragnarok,\" but will take a whole new approach to WWII with \"JoJo Rabbit.\" If the trailers are any indication, the film will portray Hitler in an entirely different light, while still exploring themes of otherism and belonging. Scarlett Johansson, Rebel Wilson, and \"Game of Thrones\" star Alfie Allen will also appear in the film, in case you needed more convincing. - Libby Torres\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n9. \"Harriet\"\n\nWhat it's about: The film will follow the real-life story of Harriet Tubman, one of the most important figures in US history for having helped free hundreds of slaves in the late 1800s.\n\nWhy see it: Cynthia Erivo as Harriet Tubman shines in the trailer, and is joined by \"Moonlight's\" Janelle Mon\u00e1e, \"Hamilton's\" Leslie Odom Jr., and \"The Favourite's\" Joe Alwyn. The movie will undoubtedly showcase a raw and necessary look into the US' history of slavery by highlighting one woman who chose to live her life protecting and fighting for her people. - Ang\u00e9lica Acevedo\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n10. \"Paradise Hills\"\n\nWhat it's about: A group of young girls are sent to an idyllic boarding school called Paradise, where they will be groomed into being what their world desires of them. But they soon realize that things aren't as perfect as they seem, and must work together to escape.\n\nWhy see it: Emma Roberts, Awkwafina, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, Danielle Macdonald, and Mila Jovovich make up the impressive cast for this women-lead, sci-fi movie. If the futuristic dystopian society plot doesn't already grab your attention, the stellar cast and stunning visuals surely will. - Ang\u00e9lica Acevedo\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n11. \"Terminator: Dark Fate\"\n\nWhat it's about: A Terminator is sent from the future by Skynet to kill a young woman in the past. Arnold Schwarzenegger's original T-800 joins Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton) to protect them and the future. If that sounds familiar, it's because it sounds a lot like the plot of the first \"Terminator\" film.\n\nWhy to see it: Does anyone need a sixth \"Teminator\" movie? Not really. But the fact that this one scraps the last three from existence is intriguing. \"Dark Fate\" will be a sequel to \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\" which is, arguably, the best \"Terminator\" movie in the franchise.\n\nSo it's also exciting to see Hamilton reprise her role as Connor along with Schwarzenegger. \"Judgment Day\" actor Edward Furlong will also be back as John Connor. Tim Miller (\"Deadpool\") is directing. - Kirsten Acuna\n\nYou can watch the trailer here.\n\nRead more: The next 'Terminator' is going to shake up the franchise by tossing out the last 3 movies as 'a bad dream'\n\n12. \"Doctor Sleep\"\n\nWhat it's about: You may not be able to tell from the title, but the film is a sequel to 1980's \"The Shining,\" following a grown-up Dan Torrence. As he tries to forget his past at the Overlook Hotel, it unexpectedly weaves its way back into his life after meeting a young girl who also has the power of the shining and learning of a dangerous group who wants that power for themselves.\n\nWhy to see it: Stephen King released the follow-up novel to \"The Shining\" in 2013 and the New York Times' best-seller is a really fast read (despite its daunting 640-page length). We're most excited to see Ewan McGregor take on the role of Jack Torrence's full grown son, Danny. Jack Nicholson played Jack in \"The Shining.\" - Kirsten Acuna\n\nYou can watch the trailer here.\n\n13. \"Last Christmas\"\n\nWhat it's about: Emilia Clarke plays a woman named Kate who works at a Christmas store in London and also sings. She meets Tom (portrayed by \"Crazy Rich Asians\" star Henry Golding), and the pair of strangers bump into each other often, eventually falling in love.\n\nWhy to see it: \"Last Christmas\" will be Clarke's first movie since completing her run as Daenerys Targaryen on HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" for eight seasons. The film also looks to be a delightful holiday movie that will feature music from late singer George Michael. Plus, it'll be interesting to see if the popular fan theory about Golding's character being a ghost or angel is actually true. - Olivia Singh\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n14. \"Ford v. Ferrari\"\n\nWhat it's about: The biographical drama follows Ford's quest to build a car to compete with the Ferrari at the Le Mans race in France. Ford's determination led to the creation of the GT40.\n\nWhy to see it: This one's for car enthusiasts. Now that Disney oversees Fox's film properties, this is a likely contender for the studio to get an Oscar nomination for one of its two leads. The early buzz for the film at the Telluride Film Festival is that it could be a best picture nominee in addition to landing a few acting nods. - Kirsten Acuna\n\nAnd, honestly, who doesn't want to watch Bale and Damon on the big screen together?\n\nYou can watch the trailer here.\n\n15. \"Charlie's Angels\"\n\nWhat it's about: \"Charlie's Angels\" is getting a reboot 19 years after the original movie (which starred Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu) was released. Kristen Stewart, \"Aladdin\" actress Naomi Scott, and rising star Ella Balinska team up as the badass private detectives who go undercover to fulfill dangerous missions. The film will be directed by Elizabeth Banks, who also co-wrote the screenplay and takes on the iconic role of Bosley.\n\nWhy to see it: A \"Charlie's Angels\" reboot is long overdue, and Stewart, Scott, and Balinska seem like a solid trio to take on the mantle for a new generation. The trailer promises explosions, action sequences, and plenty of humorous one-liners. \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\" breakout actor Noah Centineo also makes an appearance in the movie as a \"handsome nerd.\" The movie features a new track called \"Don't Call Me Angel\" from pop powerhouses Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Rey, too. - Olivia Singh\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n16. \"Frozen 2\"\n\nWhat it's about: As Elsa's powers grow, a voice calls to her from a mysterious place and leads her (along with Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf) on a new adventure.\n\nWhy to see it: The first \"Frozen\" movie was a Disney phenomenon, and the anticipated sequel looks to be a welcome exploration of the magic and mythology built into the movie's world. Insider got a peek at footage and a new song from \"Frozen 2\" during a recent D23 Expo event, and it looks every bit as delightful as the original movie. - Kim Renfro\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nRead more: 3 unanswered questions from the first 'Frozen' movie the new sequel will address\n\n17. \"Knives Out\"\n\nWhat it's about: Crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (played by Christopher Plummer) is murdered shortly after celebrating his 85th birthday with his family, and everyone's a suspect in the case.\n\nWhy to see it: \"Knives Out\" stars LaKeith Stanfield as Lt. Elliott and Daniel Craig as Detective Benoit Blanc, who investigate and try to solve the whodunit. The stellar cast also includes Chris Evans as an arrogant relative, plus Jamie Lee Curtis, Katherine Langford, and Toni Collette as more members of the family. Based on the trailer, the Rian Johnson-directed movie looks like an exciting take on the murder mystery genre. - Olivia Singh\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n18. \"Marriage Story\"\n\nWhat it's about: The Noah Baumbach-directed drama tracks the intimacy of a crumbling marriage. Baumbach has admitted that he weaved details from his own 2010 divorce into the film, which promises to pack a strong emotional punch.\n\nWhy to see it: Since its debut at the Venice International Film Festival, critics have praised \"Marriage Story\" as the writer-director's \"breakthrough into the dramatic stratosphere\" and raved about the powerful performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Plus, it'll be on Netflix, so you really have no excuse. - Callie Ahlgrim\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n19. \"Bombshell\"\n\nWhat it's about: Starring Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, and Margot Robbie, \"Bombshell\" will portray the real-life events surrounding the resignation of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes in 2016. Ailes stepped down after numerous women, including Megyn Kelly (Theron) and Gretchen Carlson (Kidman) accused him of sexual harassment.\n\nWhy to see it: The Ailes scandal was one of the first instances of women speaking out against powerful sexual harassers, since it happened about a year before the Me Too movement really took off. It'll be interesting to see how the filmmakers approach the subject matter in retrospect, given our attitudes towards toxic masculinity and abuses of power now. - Libby Torres\n\nWatch the trailer here .\n\n20. \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\"\n\nWhat it's about: It's the culmination of nine \"Star Wars\" movies, wrapping up Luke Skywalker's story that started in 1977's \"A New Hope.\"\n\nWhy to see it: Can Kylo Ren be saved from the dark side of the Force? How will Princess Leia's story wrap up? Will we ever learn whether or not Rey is a Skywalker? And what's up with Rey's new red lightsaber in the latest teaser? Is she going dark?\n\nWe're hoping that director J.J. Abrams answers all of these questions and more in December's \"Episode IX.\" We're especially curious about how Emperor Palpatine will be incorporated into the film since he supposedly died years ago. - Kirsten Acuna\n\nWatch the newest teaser for the movie here.\n\n21. \"Little Women\"\n\nWhat it's about: Based on the classic novel by Louisa May Alcott, \"Little Women\" follows the lives of four sisters growing up in 19th century New England.\n\nWhy to see it: Writer and director Greta Gerwig (\"Lady Bird\"), an exciting new filmmaker, and her ensemble cast combined with the beloved story of the March family has us eagerly anticipating this new version of \"Little Women.\" - Kim Renfro\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n22. \"Just Mercy\"\n\nWhat it's about: Lawyer Bryan Stevenson (played by Michael B. Jordan) and local advocate Eva Ansley (Brie Larson) fight to prove the innocence of a man (Jamie Foxx) sentenced to die for the muder of an 18-year-old.\n\nWhy to see it: Kilmonger and Captain Marvel together in a movie about fighting social injustices? Sign me up.\n\nMore seriously, the film is based on Stevenson who helped defend those who were wrongly convicted and put on death row and his 2014 book \"Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption.\" After \"Fruitvale Station,\" it's about time Jordan gets an Oscar nod. This may be the film to give him one. - Kirsten Acuna\n\nYou can watch a trailer here.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Naspers is listing Prosus today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9309/e931d81490c5495c85df9aefe5141c06.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
