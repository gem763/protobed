We saw it in the situation when we got the penalty, which was a clear penalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But I really stand here and should be only happy because of the way the boys did it and stuff like that but I cannot get over the Choudhury yellow card.\n\n\u2018He should know better. He maybe was unlucky with [Matt] Ritchie [who is out for two months after a tackle from Choudhury], but it was him and he has to calm down.\n\n\u2018You cannot only go for the man, and then he gets only a yellow card \u2013 I don\u2019t know how that works. You see Mo lying in the dressing room and you think, okay\u2026\u2019\n\nKlopp was livid in his post-match interview over Salah\u2019s injury (Picture: Getty)\n\nAsked if Salah was okay, Klopp snapped back: \u2018How can he be okay? He was limping from the pitch and you ask me if he\u2019s okay! How can he be okay?! Did you watch it back? Watch me, what do you think?\u2019\n\nAsked what the injury is, Klopp continued: \u2018We don\u2019t know how he is, how should we know now huh?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just really hard. Three years in a row we\u2019ve been the team with the lowest yellow cards, always the fairest team, we don\u2019t do these things. But that\u2019s to slow Mo down, that\u2019s really not okay.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was livid with a tackle from Hamza Choudhury that left Mohamed Salah injured and has told the Leicester City midfielder he needs to \u2018calm down\u2019.
