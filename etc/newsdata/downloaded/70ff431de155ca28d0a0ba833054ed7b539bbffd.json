Col. Alexander Vindman, the White House's top expert on Ukraine, after Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham called Vindman's loyalty into question for testifying about President Donald Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"There is this trend in American politics where we are criticizing veterans,\" said McCain, who also called out Hillary Clinton for saying the Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as a potential third-party presidential candidate.\n\n'It\u2019s a very, very sad story':Barbara Walters, 'View' hosts grieve former employee\n\n\"People who put their life on the line for America and freedom, their loyalty to America should not be questioned,\" McCain added. \"I don\u2019t like it when Laura Ingraham did it last night, I don\u2019t like it when Hillary Clinton does it to Tulsi Gabbard. I think it sets a very, very bizarre precedent.\"\n\nBehar challenged McCain, arguing, \"Just because somebody served does not ipso facto make them above reproach.\" McCain fired back, \"For me and where I come from, it does.\"\n\nMore: What's the dispute between Hillary Clinton and Tulsi Gabbard about?\n\nAs the co-hosts started to speak over each other, Goldberg stepped in, asking everyone to \"just take a breath.\" She added, \"Everybody has something to say at the table, we really do want to hear from everybody, but we\u2019re starting to do that thing.\"\n\nMcCain said, \"I don\u2019t know what that means, 'that thing.'\" Goldberg explained that it means talking over each other, to which McCain bluntly replied, \"Well, it\u2019s 'The View.'\"\n\n\"It is 'The View,'\" Goldberg said. \"This show has always had the ability to have different points of view, which we respect around the table. And when we talk to each other, we also exhibit respect. So when I\u2019m saying to you, 'Hold up, because we\u2019re not hearing each other,' I\u2019m not trying to cut you off \u2014 I\u2019m trying to get you heard.\"\n\nA frustrated Goldberg then cut to commercial break as McCain proceeded to interrupt her again.\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nMeghan McCain on husband Ben Domenech: 'Conservative men have better family values'", "description": "Whoopi Goldberg intervened during a heated exchange between Meghan McCain and\u00a0Joy Behar Tuesday, arguing that\u00a0her co-hosts need to\u00a0\"exhibit respect.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/09/19/USAT/043184c7-3b75-4764-b0d7-95cea9c147b9-THE_VIEW.jpg?crop=2164,1217,x422,y129&width=1778&height=1217&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
