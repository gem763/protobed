REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the White House, Kudlow said that although the United States and China have been negotiating on trade and intellectual property issues for 18 months, that was a short period of time in terms of what was at stake and negotiations could go on much longer.\n\n\u201cA deal of this size and scope and central global importance, I don\u2019t think 18 months is a very long time,\u201d Kudlow said.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are so high, we have to get it right, and if that takes a decade, so be it,\u201d Kudlow added, drawing parallels to U.S. Cold War competition against the Soviet Union.\n\nBut in confirming talks between high-level U.S. and Chinese officials in early October, Kudlow declined to predict outcomes or a specific timeline for reaching any agreements.\n\nThe plans for the first in-person U.S.-China trade meetings since late July were set during a phone call on Thursday between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Trade deputies are due to meet in mid-September.\n\nBACK TO MAY\n\nThe 14-month U.S.-China trade war has escalated sharply since May, when talks broke down after Beijing backtracked on earlier commitments to make changes in law to improve intellectual property protections, curb the forced transfer of U.S. technology to Chinese firms and improve U.S. access to Chinese markets.\n\nSince then, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply increased existing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and imposed or scheduled new tariffs on virtually all remaining imports from China to increase his negotiating leverage.\n\nKudlow told Bloomberg TV that he could not speculate on whether the September or October talks could delay a planned tariff increase on Oct. 1 to 30% from 25% on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\n\u201cWe would like to go back to where we were last May, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible, and I don\u2019t want to predict any outcomes. This is a difficult matter,\u201d told reporters at the White House.\n\nHe also said that it was important that Chinese reforms be reflected in changes to its laws and that any deal must have enforcement provisions to ensure that China lives up to its commitments.\n\nEVERYTHING ON TABLE\n\nHe said on Fox Business Network that the September and October talks would cover all of the core issues in the dispute.\n\n\u201cEverything will be on the table. You can rest assured, for example, the absolute key structural issues - the IP theft, the forced transfer of technology, the cyber space, the clouds, financial services, all of that will be on the table - agriculture purchases, industrial purchases, energy purchases, getting tariff and non-tariff barriers down,\u201d Kudlow said.\n\nWhile there were no precondition talks, Kudlow told Bloomberg TV that the Trump administration wants \u201cto see results in the near term.\u201d\n\nDirector of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow speaks to the media at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 6, 2019. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\n\u201cWhen we don\u2019t see results, we take additional actions,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cOn the other hand, if we do see results from these upcoming meetings, then progress will be made.\u201d\n\nTrump said on Twitter that China was hurting economically from the U.S. tariffs but that the new round of talks were positive.\n\n\u201c\u2018China is eating the Tariffs,\u2019\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cBillions pouring into USA. Targeted Patriot Farmers getting massive Dollars from the incoming Tariffs! Good Jobs Numbers, No Inflation(Fed). China having worst year in decades.
