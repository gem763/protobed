Focus Features\n\nYou haven't seen Harriet Tubman like this.\n\nIn the new film \u201cHarriet,\u201d in theaters Friday, expect a young, fiery depiction of the American icon, who escaped slavery only to return to the South repeatedly as a conductor known as \"Moses\" on the Underground Railroad.\n\nIn \u201cHarriet,\u201d the American heroine who helped roughly 70 slaves reach freedom through a network of safe houses is portrayed by stage actress Cynthia Erivo, who earned a 2016 Tony for her performance as Celie in Broadway\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d (Fun fact: Erivo is around 5-foot-1, just an inch taller than Tubman was.)\n\nWith thrillerlike pacing and daring plantation runs, the film charts Tubman\u2019s evolution from an illiterate slave to an abolitionist and Union spy during the Civil War.\n\n\u201cShe was incredibly brave, and fast and strong. She had the makings of a real-life superhero, which she was,\u201d \u201cHarriet\u201d director Kasi Lemmons says.\n\nSo how much of the historical drama is accurate? We checked in with Lemmons and historian Kate Clifford Larson, who consulted on \"Harriet.\"\n\nDid an enslaved Tubman really hire a lawyer?\n\nIn \u201cHarriet,\u201d Tubman (known then as \"Minty\") confronts her slave owners after hiring a lawyer, insisting that her family's freedom had been promised by the landowners' great-grandfather. Did she really do that? \u201cShe did!\u201d Larson says. \u201cShe earned the $5 to pay for the attorney to investigate an old will. Someone in the family had known ... that when Harriet Tubman\u2019s mother turned 45, she was supposed to be set free.\u201d\n\nThere is one Hollywood flourish though, the historian says: The will decreed that Tubman and her siblings should be set free when they, too, turned 45 \u2013 not at the same time as their mother. Under threat of being sold further South, Tubman escaped in 1849, journeying nearly 90 miles to get to Pennsylvania.\n\nCynthia Erivo plays Harriet Tubman in \"Harriet.\" (Photo: GLEN WILSON/FOCUS FEATURES)\n\nDid Harriet Tubman typically carry guns?\n\nWhile Tubman is often pictured as a reserved senior, \u201cHarriet,\u201d depicts the freedom fighter as a youthful, and yes, gun-toting heroine. \u201cWhy do our heroes have to be warm and fuzzy and palatable with all their edges taken off? \u201c Lemmons asks. \u201cWe are a very brave, very strong people and we have had fierce leaders. Martin Luther King Jr. had edge, and so did Harriet.\u201d\n\nIt's why images of Tubman holding firearms run through \"Harriet,\" as she relied on weapons for both protection and intimidation for slaves who dangerously got cold feet mid-run. \u201cShe told people that before they ran: \u2018Once we go there\u2019s no going back,\u2019\u201d the director says.\n\nCynthia Erivo stars as abolitionist Harriet Tubman in the biopic \"Harriet.\" (Photo: GLEN WILSON/FOCUS FEATURES)\n\nDid the real Harriet Tubman have psychic visions?\n\nIn the film, Tubman is portrayed as deeply religious woman whose psychic visions aided her dangerous journeys on the Underground Railroad.\n\nIn real life, \u201cshe was intensely faithful. That strong sense of faith was somewhat typical on the Eastern Shore, that Methodist kind of intensity,\u201d Larson says. As for her dreamlike visions, an overseer struck Tubman on the head with a heavy weight as a 13-year-old, and suffered seizures the rest of her life. Tubman believed those seizures were prophetic. \"She believed that God was speaking to her and guiding her, telling her what to do and protecting her,\" the historian says.\n\nWas Joe Alwyn\u2019s character in 'Harriet' real?\n\nIn short, not really. In the film, Harriet is chased by her slave owner\u2019s vengeful grandson, Gideon (Joe Alwyn), with whom she grew up. While Gideon's mother, the plantation matriarch Eliza Brodess (played by Jennifer Nettles) \u201cwas known as a pretty nasty person,\" says Lemmons, history has given only slight references to her son, Jonathan. So filmmakers took creative liberty filling in Alwyn's character.\n\nWhat Lemmons did know is that Jonathan took the slaves to market when young. \u201cAnd I started to think, what is it like to take people your age or younger and sell them?\u201d she says. Though cruel and conniving on screen, in real life Alwyn is \u201cthe sweetest guy in the world, the filmmaker adds. \"He\u2019s the most gentlemanly person.\u201d\n\nThis image provided by the Library of Congress shows Harriet Tubman, between 1860 and 1875. (Photo: H.B. Lindsley, Library of Congress via AP)\n\nHow often were slaves caught by black trackers?\n\nIn \u201cHarriet,\u201d white and black trackers work together to catch slaves running north. That really happened, Larson affirms, though in \"much fewer\" numbers than white slave hunters. But for some free blacks, the money wasn\u2019t easy to resist, she said. In those days, \u201cyou could buy a farm for $400 and feed your family and live a good enough life. All you\u2019d have to do was go out and capture one or two runaway slaves and you were set. They were very uncommon but they did exist, and it was a problem for the community.\u201d\n\nDid Tubman dress like a man to escape notice?\n\nIn the film, Tubman's sharp intelligence is on display, along with the variety of disguises she employed, from dressing like a man to donning clothes a middle-class free black woman would wear.\n\nThis really happened. \u201cShe did talk about it ... that she did sometimes dress in disguise, either she could wear man\u2019s clothing, or dress as an old woman, or dress as a middle class woman in fine clothes, because white people wouldn\u2019t suspect she was necessarily a slave,\u201d Larson says.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/30/harriet-tubman-fact-checking-new-movie/2502104001/", "description": "In the new film \u201cHarriet,\" expect a young, fiery depiction\u00a0of famed American abolitionist.
