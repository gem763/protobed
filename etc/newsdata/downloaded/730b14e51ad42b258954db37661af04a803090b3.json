He would have to psyche himself up for the walk between his truck and front door after finishing a shift at work (Picture: Metro US)\n\nVictor, from Los Angeles, would eat McDonald\u2019s several times a day washed down with fruit juice and said \u2018water was my enemy\u2019 (Picture: Jeff Rayner for Metro US)\n\nVictor told Metro US: \u2018I had to buy shirts at big and tall stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And my pants were made by an auntie because the ones from the big and tall stores no longer fit.\n\n\u2018The biggest size they had in pants was a 70 waist, and I was bigger than that\u2026.I felt like a monster.\u2019\n\nVictor says his weight ballooned thanks to an unhealthy diet, and worries about a brother who was regularly in and out of prison.\n\nHe explained: \u2018My fiancee called me a pathological eater.\n\nBut Victor has dramatically slimmed-down undergoing a gastric sleeve operation, and now weighs just 280 pounds (Picture: Jeff Rayner for Metro US)\n\nVictor was told he was too heavy for a gastric bypass operation, but eventually found a surgeon in Mexico who agreed to perform gastric sleeve surgery (Picture: Jeff Rayner for Metro US)\n\n\u2018I would have a hamburger combo meal by myself, and then half an hour later my mother would call me, ask me out to eat, so I could go out and eat again and have another burger or meal\n\n\u2018I drank fruit juice, sugary fruit drinks. I would never drink water, ever. Water was my enemy.\n\n\u2018For breakfast I would have McDonald\u2019s \u2013 two sausage McMuffins with egg, a breakfast burrito, two hash browns and an orange juice.\n\n\u2018For lunch I\u2019d have a breakfast burrito with fries and soda, sometimes two burritos.\n\n\u2018My weakness was was bread, pastries, muffins, cheesecake.\u2019\n\nVictor says he loves being able to buy cheaper, normal-sized clothes in regular stores \u2013 and says he no longer \u2018feels like a monster\u2019 (Picture: Jeff Rayner for Metro US)\n\nVictor is now down to a size \u2018XL\u2019 \u2013 and says his shoe size has also shrunk as his weight has decreased (Picture: Jeff Rayner for Metro US)\n\nVictor said working night shifts in a convenience store gave him easy access to food and soda, and that he didn\u2019t notice his weight creep up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut his size had a terrible impact on his general health, as he explained: \u2018It would physically hurt to even be on my feet.\n\n\u2018After work I would stay in my truck parked because I had to build up the courage to walk 15 feet to my front door, it was so painful.\u2019 Victor also neglected his social life, and would stay in his room and refuse to see friends because he was so self-conscious about his size.\n\nVictor finally decided to do something about his weight after developing pockets of fat on his legs, and being warned by doctors his weight would kill him.\n\nHe attempted to organize a gastric band \u2013 a procedure which sees the stomach pinched to reduce its size \u2013 but was told he was too big to undergo the surgery safely.\n\nVictor has swapped his old diet of burgers and burritos for lean meat, eggs, fish, rice \u2013 and lots of vegetables (Picture: Jeff Rayner for Metro US)\n\nVictor\u2019s stomach has dramatically shrunk in size, meaning each meal he eats now weighs just four ounces (Picture: Jeff Rayner for Metro US)\n\nSo Victor instead found a surgeon in Ensenada, Mexico who agreed to perform a gastric sleeve operation \u2013 where part of the stomach is cut out.\n\nHe went under the knife for the $4,500 surgery in March 2017, and began losing weight almost immediately afterwards.\n\nVictor said: \u2018I first started to notice the weight drop off after a month.\n\n\u2018I started following a very active plan \u2013 eating high protein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I started weighing out my food \u2013 four or five ounces per meal, and walking 20,000 steps a day.\u2019\n\nVictor\u2019s weight loss surgery also helped him meet fiancee Taryn Lee Thompson, who has undergone a similar procedure. The couple plan to get married in 2021 (Picture: Jeff Rayner for Metro US)\n\nThe dieter swapped his old junk food-laden diet for spinach chicken salads, hard boiled eggs, lean beef with rice and snacks of yogurt and cucumber.\n\nVictor was thrilled to see the weight drop off and his overall health improve, with compliments flooding in from family members and customers at the store where he works.\n\nThe slimmer now weights 284 pounds, and says he may celebrate reaching his goal weight of 270 pounds with a tattoo.\n\nHe even met his fiancee Taryn Lee Thompson, 37, in a support group for other slimmers, and is now saving to have excess skin left over after his weight loss removed by a surgeon.\n\nVictor, who plans to marry Taryn in 2021, said: \u2018I feel fantastic.\n\n\u2018I still can\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u2018My fiance says \u201cI can\u2019t believe you used to be 661 pounds.\u201d\n\n\u2018We watch these TV shows about obese people all the time, and I can\u2019t believe I used to be like that.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s unbelievable how well the surgery has worked. I don\u2019t recognize who that person is. It\u2019s not me anymore.\u2019\n\nDo you have a US news story?
