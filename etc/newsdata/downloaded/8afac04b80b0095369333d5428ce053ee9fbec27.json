As a British member of the European Parliament, the spectacle has been particularly hard to watch.\n\nThe dramatic twists and turns of British politics these past few weeks have made it clear that no option can be ruled out when it comes to the U.K.\u2019s long-term relationship with the EU \u2014 let alone who will govern the U.K. in the short term. \u201cLiterally anything could happen,\u201d as one of my colleagues observed to me earlier this week.\n\nBritain \u2014 and the future of its democracy \u2014 seems on particularly perilous footing. Seen from Brussels, there\u2019s a bitter irony in this.\n\nA British government that is threatening to march the country out of the European Union because it claims its institutions are \u201cundemocratic\u201d shut down its own country\u2019s parliament last month. Prime Minister Boris Johnson uses incendiary language and accuses those who disagree with his Brexit policy of \u201cterrible collaboration\u201d with the EU.\n\nBritain today is increasingly out of step with the basic principles of democracy it once would have championed.\n\nThere is no \u201cnew deal\u201d on offer in Brussels, nor is the prime minister trying to negotiate one in good faith.\n\nLast week\u2019s U.K. Supreme Court ruling, which determined Johnson\u2019s proroguing of parliament had been unlawful, was a landmark moment \u2014 and a bright spot in a worrying trajectory for British politics.\n\nSadly, the euphoria that followed masked deeper political problems. Parliament has required Johnson, by law, to seek an extension of Article 50 on or before October 19, if the Commons has not either endorsed a Brexit deal or given consent to the prime minister to proceed without one. And yet the prime minister continues to assert that the U.K. will leave on October 31 regardless.\n\nCompare that with what\u2019s happening in Brussels. While my British parliamentary colleagues were shut out of their chamber against their will, members of the European Parliament have been pressing on with urgent issues.\n\nThe European Parliament is scrutinizing the incoming Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s new team and has taken a strong stand against nominees with potential conflicts of interest. MEPs have also set an ambitious agenda to tackle the climate emergency and ensure that the EU\u2019s member states uphold the rule of law \u2014 something our own government needs reminding of.\n\nLed by Britain, the EU helped catalyze the democratization of former Soviet states by offering a way into the biggest, borderless single market in the world. A critical part of that process was holding aspirant EU member states to the so-called Copenhagen criteria, which require \u201cstable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.\u201d The U.K. can only be a leader in the world if it continues to respect those same standards itself.\n\nOnce a trailblazer for the principles of open markets, human rights and the rule of law, the U.K. is now in danger of finding itself robbed of the right to moral leadership in all three areas. It is seeking divorce from the biggest market in the world, derogation from obligations on human rights and a \u201cpick and mix\u201d attitude to equality before the law.\n\nAmong my colleagues from around Europe, there is real and widespread concern for the state of our country, balanced only by optimism that Johnson may not be in office for long.\n\nIncapable of being a serious prime minister in the first place, he has bulldozed ahead with a strategy that is not only politically perilous but illegal. There is no \u201cnew deal\u201d on offer in Brussels, nor is the prime minister trying to negotiate one in good faith. Johnson is on yet another collision course with the law, and \u2014 in turn \u2014 with reality.\n\nThat\u2019s why our 16-strong group of Liberal Democrat MEPs is busy lobbying European leaders to accept an extension when the inevitable request arrives, as well as the longer-term work of creating legislation designed to bring about a fairer, more exclusive economy and protect our planet.\n\nSadly, if Johnson gets his way, we\u2019ll find ourselves locked out of a powerful vehicle for change and relegated to looking in from the outside as a great democratic project moves forward without us. Seeing the turmoil swallowing Britain, I know where I'd rather be.\n\nLuisa Porritt is deputy leader of the U.K. Liberal Democrats in the European Parliament.", "description": "It\u2019s ironic the British government insists EU is \u2018undemocratic\u2019 as it loses sight of its own values.", "authors": ["Luisa Porritt", "Lili Bayer", "James Randerson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173438366-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
