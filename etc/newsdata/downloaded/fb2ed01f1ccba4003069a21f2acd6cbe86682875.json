The \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d star said while Corporate America has taken some modest steps to use fewer plastics in their production, more needs to be done to address the gross excess that is still clogging up the world\u2019s oceans.\n\nWoodley is now hitching her activist star power to American Express (AXP). a longtime plastic user. The credit card company \u2014 known for its light green plastic credit cards \u2014 revealed Monday its first-ever card made primarily from reclaimed plastic from beaches, islands and coastal communities. It\u2019s linked up with noted ocean waste activist Parley for the Oceans for the effort, which includes a #BackOurOceans social media campaign.\n\nAmerican Express has also promised to launch a new card recycling program starting in 2020.\n\nShailene Woodley attends The Hollywood Foreign Press Association and The Hollywood Reporter's Toronto International Film Festival party on day three of TIFF at the Four Seasons Hotel on Saturday, Sept. 7, 2019, in Toronto.

There is enough plastic in our oceans to circle the world 400 times. These are rough estimates,\u201d says Woodley. \u201cThe real crisis is micro plastics, which we can\u2019t see. Right now we don\u2019t have the technology to clean up the oceans in the way that we need to in the scale that we need to.\u201d\n\nThe numbers around plastic driven ocean pollution are rather startling. They go a long way in explaining why supermarkets have done away with plastic bags and footwear makers have explored making sneakers from recycled materials. Around 8 million metric tons of plastic enter oceans each year, according to Ocean Blue Project. According to the Ocean Conservancy, 60% of all seabirds and nearly 100% of sea turtles have mistaken plastic for food.\n\n\u201cConsumers and corporations need to work together to innovate and create new options,\u201d said Woodley.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
