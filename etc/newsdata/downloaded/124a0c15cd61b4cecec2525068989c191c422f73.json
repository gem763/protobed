But the maneuvering in the wake of Mr. Johnson\u2019s announcement showed that even this bid could fall prey to the same political forces that have subverted all previous efforts.\n\nMr. Johnson, who has already been forced to break his word by requesting an extension of the Brexit deadline until Jan. 31, presented the opposition with a quid pro quo: he would give members more time to deliberate over his deal with the European Union if they agreed to back an election on Dec. 12.", "description": "Britain\u2019s prime minister challenged lawmakers to approve a general election, but the opposition Labour Party reacted coolly to the idea.", "authors": ["Stephen Castle", "Mark Landler"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/world/24brexit/24brexit-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
