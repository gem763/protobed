Take off Mondays and you\u2019ll miss out on bank holidays, the argument goes.\n\nBut is that actually true? When you\u2019re deciding whether to apply to work from home, or part-time work, which day is best to isolate as the ideal day \u201coff\u201d?\n\nThe good news is that this is a good time to be contemplating flexible work, an arrangement where the employee has moderate control over how, where or when they work. This could involve working from home, working part-time, job sharing or having another kind of flexitime arrangement, and is especially propitious for parents, who benefit from a working arrangement that supports a more flexible home life, too.\n\nHow to ask for flexible working\n\nAlthough company attitudes vary, the research supports requests for flexible work. According to research from the 2012 Flexible Working Provision and Uptake Survey Report, flexi-work has a positive impact on a number of areas of organisational performance, with 72 per cent of those polled citing a positive impact on employee motivation and retention. Meanwhile, a 2017 study found that 87 percent of full-time employees in the UK either work flexibly or would prefer to do so.", "description": "Mondays are the worst day to take off for parents who work part-time:", "authors": ["Morgan Lawrence", "Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez", "Zoe Strimpel", "James Millar"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education-and-careers/2019/09/10/TELEMMGLPICT000183946251-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-wioWl5aH7fAEJ8IWJw2Yw_hdviTmVO3LOKbtZ3uvfI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
