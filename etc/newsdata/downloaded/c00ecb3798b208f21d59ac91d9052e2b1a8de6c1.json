So could the Japan-Scotland game in Yokohama.\n\nFukuoka is situated on the north shore of Kyushu Island and, according to weather experts, was initially the most threatened by the typhoon. All games canceled because of weather are logged as scoreless draws and each team will get two competition points.\n\nSuch a scenario would leave Japan top with 14 points and three ahead of Ireland, which is three points behind and would qualify in second place ahead of third-place Scotland (10 points).\n\nStill, Ireland would much prefer to play, if for no other reason than to shake off some rustiness.\n\nJoe Schmidt\u2019s Ireland lineup routed Scotland 27-3 and Russia 35-0, either side of an upset 19-12 loss to Japan.\n\n\u201cThere are certain elements in our game against Russia that we\u2019d like to think we could have done better,\u201d Ireland forwards coach Simon Easterby said. \u201cWe feel we maybe haven\u2019t quite hit our (straps), probably since the Scotland game and maybe the first 20 minutes of the Japan game.\u201d\n\nEasterby says the players are very keen to make amends, and there have been some \u201ctasty\u201d scrum sessions in training.\n\n\u201cYou need those types of sessions and you need that competitive edge,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this forward pack has that.\u201d\n\nSamoa lost 38-19 to Samoa last Saturday, but competed strongly against Japan for long spells.\n\nIreland lock Iain Henderson expects Samoa to come out aggressively from the outset.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be ultra-excited to get the ball in their hand, they\u2019re going to be looking to do as much damage to us as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the way Japan started against us, I think that\u2019s a good indication of what Samoa are going to try and do.\u201d\n\nHead coach Steve Jackson\u2019s Samoa side dealt confidently with Russia, winning 34-9 in a bruising encounter, then lost 34-0 to Scotland.\n\nWhile Samoa was poor against Scotland, the players left the field with regrets after the Japan game.\n\n\u201cWe know that we could have done more. That\u2019s something that we\u2019ve got to take on the chin but we\u2019re always going to go all guns blazing this weekend against Ireland,\u201d backrower Josh Tyrell said. \u201cThe Japanese did something amazing (against Ireland) and we\u2019re hoping to follow their footsteps. Ireland is a well-organized machine that keeps going and going and never stops. So we are hoping to get in there and tweak up the machine and smash it.\u201d\n\nThe New-Zealand born Tyrell will be especially motivated when he comes up against Ireland center Bundee Aki, who went to New Zealand\u2019s Manurewa High School.\n\n\u201cI played against Aki back in school,\u201d Tyrell said. \u201cI looked up to him when he was at (New Zealand-based club side) the Chiefs and I\u2019m hoping to get in his face this weekend.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ireland still gets a chance to finish top of its Rugby World Cup group after avoiding a typhoon - for now.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
