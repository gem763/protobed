He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nA spokeswoman for Nazir did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shahrir declined to comment.\n\nIn 2015, Nazir went on a leave of absence after the Wall Street Journal reported that he received about $7m from Najib and disbursed the funds to other politicians before elections in 2013.\n\nAn independent review into the money transfer concluded that Nazir did not misuse his position and there was no inappropriate use of the CIMB\u2019s resources, following which Nazir resumed his duties as chairman. He resigned last year after almost three decades at the bank.\n\nNazir had received about 25.7 million ringgit in cheques, Latheefa said. She declined to confirm whether these were the same funds that Nazir had allegedly received in 2013.\n\nAfter winning last year's election, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's administration has reopened 1MDB probes, charged dozens of high-ranked officials, and filed civil forfeiture actions in a bid to recover money linked to 1MDB.\n\nSince 2016, the US Department of Justice has filed forfeiture lawsuits on about $1.7bn in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds, including a private jet, luxury real estate and jewellery.\n\nIn May, the United States began returning to Malaysia some $200m recovered from the sale of seized assets.", "description": "The individuals could face action under Malaysia's anti-money laundering act if they fail to pay the fines.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/4eb0293323a546929a9bf6820ddaaf2d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
