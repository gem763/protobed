And one of the ways we can improve it is to improve our immigration court system so that they have the resources to actually go through these claims.\u201d\n\nCastro also stated he would work to \u201cchange some of the policy that\u201d the Trump administration has implemented since 2017.\n\nIf somebody has been the victim of domestic violence or gang violence that that does count toward making an asylum claim. There are ways that we can improve it, but the first thing we\u2019ve gotta do is end this \u2018remain in Mexico\u2019 policy that is subjecting people who are already desperate to beatings and extortion and to these drug cartels that are kidnapping them and then getting money from their relatives in central America.\n\nCastro was also asked if he would be willing to \u201ccome and help\u201d migrants seeking to come to America as Democrat presidential hopeful and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) did in July.\n\nCastro spoke on his experiences of visiting migrant detention centers and told the voter that he and his campaign \u201cwould be glad to see how we can be helpful in doing that.\u201d\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security outlines Migrant Protection Protocols as: \u201cThe Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) are a U.S. Government action whereby certain foreign individuals entering or seeking admission to the U.S. from Mexico \u2013 illegally or without proper documentation \u2013 may be returned to Mexico and wait outside of the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings, where Mexico will provide them with all appropriate humanitarian protections for the duration of their stay.\u201d", "description": "Juli\u00e1n Castro stated that he would \"issue an executive order ending the Migrant Protection Protocol\" should he be elected.", "authors": ["Kyle Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Julian-Castro-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
