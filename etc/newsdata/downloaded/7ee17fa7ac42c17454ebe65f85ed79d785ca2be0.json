I happen to think it does.\u201d\n\nIn his most pointed comments yet about Mr. Obama\u2019s possible knowledge of the FBI\u2019s actions, the president said he is eagerly awaiting the outcome of a Justice Department inspector general\u2019s report on the origins of the FBI\u2019s decision to monitor Trump campaign officials for possible collusion with Russia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting for the report like everybody else, but I predict you will see things and you won\u2019t even believe the level of corruption,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters earlier in the day. \u201cWhether it\u2019s President Obama himself, let\u2019s see whether or not it\u2019s President Obama. Let\u2019s see whether or not they put that [in the report].\u201d\n\nTold by a reporter that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said Mr. Trump is making the \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d of his presidency by withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, the president unloaded on his frequent ally. He said Mr. Graham should spend his time investigating Mr. Obama and the origins of the FBI probe, instead of worrying about the Middle East.\n\n\u201cI think Lindsey should focus on Judiciary. \u2026 That\u2019s what the people of South Carolina want him to focus on,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe people of South Carolina want to see those troops come home. I won an election based on that. Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next 1,000 years.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Mr. Trump said there is \u201cnothing wrong\u201d with his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani investigating U.S. election corruption that he believes originated in Ukraine.\n\nWarning that Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort will come back to haunt them, Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that Mr. Giuliani \u201cwas seeking out corruption\u201d in his probe and his discussions with Ukraine officials.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with seeking out corruption,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cPeople want to find out, why was it so corrupt during that [2016] election? And I want to find out more than anybody else.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s still asking the FBI to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server and her 33,000 erased emails. Mr. Trump said it\u2019s believed to be held by a company whose ownership is primarily Ukrainian.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s on the server,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cRepublicans want to see it.\u201d\n\nHe said the House impeachment inquiry will result in Republicans winning back the House majority. And he warned that Republicans \u201ccan do the same thing in reverse\u201d if there is ever a Democratic president, referring to an impeachment that he calls illegitimate.\n\nThe president told reporters that former National Security Adviser John R. Bolton is \u201ca good man\u201d whose tenure there \u201cjust didn\u2019t work out.\u201d Some House Democrats say they want to subpoena Mr. Bolton in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nA former NSC official, Fiona Hill, has told House Democrats in private testimony that Mr. Bolton considered Mr. Giuliani \u201ca hand grenade\u201d who would blow up the rest of them with his back-channel investigation in Ukraine.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
