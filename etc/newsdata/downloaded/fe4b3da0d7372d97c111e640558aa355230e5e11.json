(Phil Noble/Reuters)\n\nLiverpool continued its perfect start to the Premier League season by beating Sheffield United 1-0 on Saturday, earning its seventh consecutive win despite being outplayed for much of the match by the newly promoted side.\n\nHad it not been for a mistake by Blades goalkeeper Dean Henderson with just over 20 minutes remaining \u2014 on the Reds\u2019 first very shot on target \u2014 Liverpool would\u2019ve dropped its first points of 2019-20.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nInstead, Georginio Wijnaldum was credited with the decisive strike after Henderson let the Dutch midfielder\u2019s powerful drive slip underneath his torso and bounce over the line:\n\nLiverpool\u2019s latest victory sent last season\u2019s runner-up eight points clear of defending champion Manchester City atop the Prem table. City takes on Everton later Saturday.\n\nSheffield United was fortunate when the visitors misfired on a pair of first-half opportunities. But they had the better of Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side for most of the second half of the contest. The hosts could have even taken the lead, but Reds captain Jordan Henderson blocked a goal-bound attempt with his body.\n\nAfterward, Klopp didn\u2019t necessarily agree that his team was lucky to escape with three points. But he admitted that getting them was crucial.\n\n\u201cFor us, it was important to win,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWhen you win a lot of games, they are not all beauties. Thats\u2019s how it is. We had work really hard, and the boys did. We could\u2019ve done better but you have to respect the opponent. They defend in a way that is really difficult.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bramall Lane crowd came alive after Dean Henderson\u2019s howler. The match opened up as the Blades pressed for the point they deserved, but although Liverpool\u2019s front three of Sadio Mane, Bobby Firmino and Mohamed Salah couldn\u2019t put the game away with a second goal off the counterattack, the Reds held on defensively.\n\nIn the end, it was Liverpool\u2019s least convincing win so far. On the other hand, it was precisely the sort of match that trophy-winning teams manage to eke out the road to glory. If Liverpool winds up atop the podium in May at the conclusion of another another tight title race, the good fortune they found against unfortunate Sheffield United could well be the reason why.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Premier League-leading Liverpool continued its perfect start to the season by winning its seventh consecutive game on Saturday, despite being outplayed for much of the match by promoted Sheffield United.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mvgsDsFL9QkL6z8.x.KhaA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODMuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0i17Uq0s0AQeo65o1gY4jA--~B/aD0yMjk4O3c9MzMzMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/dce12a70-e1f2-11e9-aaff-a567c2f953af", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
