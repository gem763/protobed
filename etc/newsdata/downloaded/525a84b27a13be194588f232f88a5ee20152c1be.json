I did not buy a sodding Fitbit in order to give Google the entire motherlode of my intimate biological data. I did not consent to this.\u2019\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai (Image: AP)\n\nFitbit shares rose 27% on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.4 billion. Alphabet shares rose 2% to $1,293.49.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA deal for Fitbit would come as its dominant share of the fitness tracking sector continues to be chipped away by cheaper offerings from companies such as China\u2019s Huawei and Xiaomi.\n\nFitbit\u2019s fitness trackers monitor users\u2019 daily steps, calories burned and distance traveled. They also measure floors climbed, sleep duration and quality, and heart rate.\n\nFitbit, which helped pioneer the wearable devices craze, has been partnering with health insurers and has been making tuck-in acquisitions in the healthcare market, as part of efforts to diversify its revenue stream.\n\nAnalysts have said that much of the company\u2019s value may now lie in its health data.\n\nFitbit cut its 2019 revenue forecast in July, blaming disappointing sales of its newly launched cheapest smartwatch Versa Lite. The watch is priced at $160, compared with $200 for the full version. It can track workouts and heart rate but lacks features such as the ability to store music directly.\n\nIn August, Fitbit said it had signed a contract with the Singapore government to provide fitness trackers and services in a health program it said could reach up to 1 million users.\n\nFitbit in August also launched its latest smartwatch, Versa 2, adding Amazon.com Inc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice assistant Alexa, online payments and music storage to the device\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities. Fitbit is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 6. Alphabet is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings later on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFitbit would not be the first deal that Google would be carrying out in the wearables space. Fossil Group Inc said in January it would sell its intellectual property related to smartwatch technology under development to Google for $40 million. Google\u2019s plans for these assets are not clear.\n\nReuters had reported last month that Fitbit was speaking to investment bank Qatalyst Partners about exploring a sale.", "description": "Smartwatches are a great way of gathering huge amounts of data about people who wear them.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fitbbi-f143_1572348185.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
