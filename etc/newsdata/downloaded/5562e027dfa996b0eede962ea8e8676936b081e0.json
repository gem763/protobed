And that\u2019s all thanks to one pop-cultural phenomenon.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- How Judy Garland became the ultimate gay icon\n\n- Why Tales of the City is the ultimate LGBTQ+ fantasy\n\n- The new frontier of sexuality without labels\n\nBack in 2009, TV show RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, in which iconic 1990s queen RuPaul searched for \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Drag Superstar\u201d, began on the small, LGBTQ+-aimed cable channel Logo. Ten years on, and it has grown to become one of the defining series of our age, helping to make drag a mainstream artform like never before. In the US, there have been 11 regular series, as well as four All Stars series, which now fill the gaps between the regular seasons, and feature the return of popular ex-contestants for another shot at a title.\n\nLast month, RuPaul picked up his fourth Emmy for outstanding host, and the show also won Best Reality/Competition Program, bringing its Emmy total to 13 awards and 29 nominations. The show now airs on the bigger VH1 channel in the US, while it has gained a large global following on Netflix, anecdotally breaking out far beyond LGBTQ+ viewers to be watched by all ages and sexualities. Now, RuPaul is making the franchise truly international by rolling out a series of spin-offs \u2013 there have been two series of Drag Race Thailand, while this week comes the launch of Drag Race UK; Drag Race Canada and Australia are set to follow.\n\nAn explosive new age\n\nBut, of course, there is far more to the drag scene than a television show. In his new book Drag: The Complete Story, New York-based fashion writer Simon Doonan offers both a vibrant history of drag \u2013 from Ancient Egypt onwards \u2013 and a celebration of what he sees as its reinvigoration over the past decade.\n\nHe ascribes its \u201cexplosive\u201d new energy in part to the \u2018RuPaul effect\u2019, but also to other factors. There is the rise of social media: \u201cDrag lends itself very much to [the form] \u2013 because it\u2019s visual and it\u2019s very humour-based and cheeky\u201d. And there is the \u201cunbelievably new and exciting gender revolution,\u201d whereby trans and non-binary performers are shaking up the old drag template of a cisgender man wearing a dress.\n\nSome forms of drag have been rejuvenated and revived and there are [people] developing whole new lines of performance practice \u2013 Mark Edward, drag academic and artist\n\nDr Mark Edward, reader in dance and performance at Lancashire\u2019s Edge Hill University, agrees that these are particularly exciting times for the artform. He has long been a drag artist himself, and drag is one of his specialist areas of academic research; he is currently co-editing two essay collections on the subject, due for publication in 2020, one of which will delve into contemporary practices across the globe. \u201cThere\u2019s been a resurgence over the last few years,\u201d he says. \u201cSome forms of drag have been rejuvenated and revived, new forms are coming on board, and there are [people] developing whole new lines of performance practice.\u201d\n\nThere is a question that nags though: has Drag Race really been a boon to the drag world\u2019s creative surge \u2013 or has it been working in opposition to it? Doonan sees the show\u2019s influence as altogether positive, with its range of queens and looks providing a \u201chandbook\u201d for a new generation of performers who can see the \u201cgenres that are possible, and be inspired by that\u201d. He points out that an aspiring queen may take inspiration, say, from the \u201csuper-arty and sensual\u201d style of season 9 winner Sasha Velour, or by contrast, the \u201cglamazon\u201d supermodel look of season 7 victor Violet Chachki.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Doonan points to the associated DragCon conventions as a showcase for the full spectrum of performers: \u201cthere\u2019s young kids who identify as drag queens, straight women who identify as drag queens ... there\u2019s a huge emphasis on diversity.\u201d\n\nA question of diversity\n\nHowever critics of the television show itself \u2013 which constitutes many people\u2019s primary or sole experience of drag \u2013 have argued that its diversity is no more than skin deep, if indeed it can be credited with diversity at all. Firstly, there are the looks it favours. Every episode builds to a climactic fashion runway round, which inevitably, perhaps, puts an emphasis on conventional physical attractiveness and glossy styling \u2013 an overall \u2018fabulousness\u2019, you might say. Today\u2019s preponderance of so-called \u2018look queens\u2019 on the show and otherwise has also been fuelled by the rise of Instagram, with many young drag artists driven first and foremost to express themselves through photographic images over live performance.\n\nMark Edward says the show has \u201cdone a great job in terms of platforming drag, and giving it a big broad media presence\u201d. But he also worries about it creating a production-line drag aesthetic, \u201cwhere [a drag performer] isn\u2019t validated because they\u2019re not seen to be contouring the way they should be on the nose, or their make-up does not have the right aesthetic or they are deemed drag \u2018old school\u2019.\u201d Certainly, whether lightly ironic or not, there are many more queens who seek to conform to the very beauty ideals that many others have sought to subvert or disrupt, from past provocateurs like Leigh Bowery and Divine to modern-day mavericks like, for example, the demonic-looking self-styled \u2018drag terrorist\u2019 Christeene.\n\nWe do get a lot of straight audiences at our show who expect the one thing and actually get something quite different \u2013 Amrou Al-Kadhi, aka Glamrou\n\nThen there are the specific types of performance it platforms. Amrou Al-Kadhi, aka Glamrou, is a drag queen who founded and performs with drag troupe Denim, one of the most acclaimed UK acts of the moment. In their witty and powerful new autobiography Unicorn: The Memoir of a Muslim Drag Queen, they trace their drag journey, among other things \u2013 from seeing drag intitially as a means \u201cto express myself and find confidence that I wasn't having in my actual life,\u201d to using it as a more political tool \u201cwith which to explore gender and cultural identity\u201d.\n\nAl-Kadhi appreciates the fact that Drag Race \u201cshows the amount of talent you need and just what you have to go through in your life\u201d to be a queen \u2013 but it has also left mainstream audiences with narrow expectations of what a drag queen should do, they say. Denim are a musical comedy group who sing live, and yet, they say, there is now a presumption that drag queens will lip-sync and do celebrity impersonations \u2013 both skills which Drag Race queens are tested on. \u201cWe do get a lot of straight audiences at our show who expect the one thing because of [the show] and actually get something quite different,\u201d they say. \u201c... [because it] isn\u2019t fully representative of the more countercultural stuff that\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nAs well as the paradigm of drag that Drag Race promotes, there has long been debate about who gets to take part in its glitzy parade in the first place. The aforementioned gender revolution is not something that the show has really accounted for: the vast majority of the contestants remain cisgender men who are performing as female characters, as affirmed by the fact its famous imperative, \u201cGentlemen start your engines and may the best woman win!\u201d remains unchanged. There have certainly not been any drag kings, or performers with masculine personas, on the show as yet.\n\nIn 2018, RuPaul said in an interview with the Guardian that he would probably not allow a trans female contestant on the show, if they had started a medical transition; he subsequently apologised for his comment. Recently, in another interview promoting Drag Race UK, he said that he didn\u2019t rule out any women appearing on his shows, though none have made the cut for the spin-off\u2019s launch series.\n\nAdding a British flavour\n\nWhen it comes to Drag Race UK, it\u2019s clear that the producers, rather than try to create a facsimile of the US series, have made sure it possesses a British flavour. That\u2019s evident in everything, from contestants\u2019 names (Baga Chipz, Cheryl Hole) and outfits (in the first episode, they serve looks inspired by Queen Elizabeth II herself) to their niche local references. Look out for an impersonation of Kim Woodburn, a formidable cleaning guru from the now-defunct UK television show How Clean is Your House?, who furthered her camp appeal during an erratic stint on the UK\u2019s Celebrity Big Brother \u2013 and, it is fair to say,will mean little to international viewers.\n\nMore generally, some of the high-gloss varnish of the original has been chipped off. While preparing for the catwalk challenge, the queens pointedly discuss how in Britain, a queen can 'get away' with no brows and hairy chests \u2013 and it is imbued with a sense of what Doonan describes as the \u201cbawdy, end-of-the pier comedic sensibility\u201d, that some would say is a traditional characteristic of British drag.\n\nWhen I think about the drag performers that are the best that I know, they're not on the show \u2013 Amrou Al-Kadhi, aka Glamrou\n\nBut, distinctly British though it may be, whether it really reflects the creativity of the UK scene is another matter. Al-Kadhi does not want to pre-judge the show, but notes that the line-up is majority white - with just two non-white queens from the line up of ten - \u201c[and] when I think about the drag performers that are the best that I know, they're not on the show.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Al-Kadhi says that the acts they find most exciting on the London scene at the moment are invariably non-binary people of colour (as Al-Kadhi also is). Those they namecheck include art-world star Victoria Sin; Afro-Latinx drag king Chiyo Gomes; and ShayShay, who \u201ccreates amazing spaces for people of colour\u2026 These are people who are exploring race and gender at the same time in new ways. They feel over 50 years ahead of Drag Race to be honest\u201d.\n\nWe need community between queer people, not competition so that straight people can have a good time watching us be bitchy \u2013 Amrou Al-Kadhi, aka Glamrou\n\nAnd while Drag Race may not be representing the future of drag, the extent to which it acknowledges drag history \u2013 or \u2018herstory\u2019 \u2013 is another point of contention. Among the queens who get selected, there is, perhaps, an emphasis on youth over experience: one contestant in the new UK line-up, 20-year-old Scaredy Kat, early on declares she has never performed before, while the oldest queens are 35.\n\nThen there\u2019s the format of the thing. The show, like many a reality TV programme, is founded on competition \u2013 and that's compounded by the fact the contestants have appropriated the ideology of insulting each other by \u2018throwing shade\u2019 and \u2018reading\u2019 (more and less veiled forms of mocking a rival, respectively) from 1980s drag ball culture.\n\nThis competitive element can be disconcerting to those who would rather emphasise drag\u2019s spirit of community and collaboration. That, certainly, is Al-Kadhi\u2019s experience of drag culture - beyond the fact that their fellow Denim members are their \u201cdrag sisters\u201d, in the wider community \u201cwe all support each other and help each other,\u201d they say. \u201cEspecially in this toxic time, I think we need community and safety between queer people, not competition so that straight people can have a good time watching us be bitchy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Edward warmly recalls the kind of mentorship that helped him starting out as a drag queen in the late-1980s. \u201cWe had drag mothers, mine was Chris D\u2019Bray in Wigan, and she did a very good job\u201d \u2013 and that he thinks may, to some degree, have been lost in an age where you \u201ccan click a button and say you\u2019re a drag queen overnight\u201d.\n\nThe drag economy\n\nTo look beyond the specific criticisms that can be levelled at Drag Race, the bigger question is: does it really matter if it is a poor representation of the drag scene? In the same way that American Idol or The Voice may not provide an accurate or particularly edifying guide to modern pop music, expecting a mass-market reality TV show of any kind to be enlightening about their chosen field may be wishful. Yet, when it comes to Drag Race, there is more at stake for the drag world as a whole, given how relatively few other major platforms it has \u2013 and therefore its influence is potentially more pernicious.\n\nIt used to be that a local drag celebrity could sell out a venue, but now if you aren\u2019t on the show, you might as well be brand new \u2013 Vivvyanne ForeverMORE\n\nAlongside the annoyance of audiences expecting to see Drag Race-esque performances, Al-Kadhi's fear, which they wrote about in the Guardian last year, is that Drag Race UK could create a two-tier economy. \u201cThere are a lot of people who make their money through doing drag, and unfortunately, the queens who [may] get all the jobs are the ones who\u2019ve been on the show. And what does that do to all the other drag queens?\u201d\n\nUS drag queens, certainly, have reported such an effect: season-7 contestant Jasmine Masters notoriously released a video, following her appearance on the show, in which she described how she went on the show in order to get a pay rise after she found her stock falling. In 2017, meanwhile, the San Franciscan drag queen Vivvyanne ForeverMORE told Billboard: \u201cIt used to be that a local drag celebrity could sell out a venue, but now if you aren\u2019t on the show, you might as well be brand new. That type of thing bums me out, because there are so many legends here in San Francisco.\u201d\n\nFundamentally, also, drag could be seen as an artform that has thrived off being outside the mainstream \u2013 so where does that leave it when it seemingly loses its transgressive status?\n\nMark Edward has always understood drag as inherently disruptive and counter-cultural. As a young man, he also immersed himself in the blooming acid house movement and its illegal raves \u2013 and he says that, from the very beginning, its anarchic spirit influenced his performance work.\n\nSome years ago, he created the drag persona of Gale Force, a formidable, ageing, working-class queen, with whom he has \u201cdisplaced\u201d drag by appearing in public spaces such as supermarkets and shopping centres rather than on stage. In 2012, he lived as Gale Force in a run-down council house installation as part of the Homotopia festival in Liverpool. He says he is ambivalent about the extent of drag\u2019s popularity in 2019: \u201con one level, I love the way it\u2019s going and on the other I wonder \u2018are we losing something?\u2019\u2026 we have drag brunches now, and drag hen parties, and drag queens reading children\u2019s stories in libraries \u2013 which I absolutely love, may I add \u2013 but I wonder: is drag losing something by becoming mainstream?\u201d\n\nIn the past, by doing drag, you would be breaking taboos \u2013 but now you're making sure those taboos don\u2019t get reinstated \u2013 Simon Doonan, fashion writer\n\nDoonan, however, is not worried about drag\u2019s de-fanging because he believes it remains a fundamentally political act. \u201cProhibition of drag goes back centuries. So just by virtue of doing it, in the past, you would be breaking taboos, but now you're making sure those taboos don\u2019t get reinstated. Yes, it's [political] putting on a frock and walking down the street, just as it\u2019s political for women to put on a suit and dress as a man.\u201d\n\nIt is also undeniably true that for some LGBTQ+ viewers, having such a strongly LGBTQ+-centred show being given such a mainstream cultural platform has been monumental in making them feel \u2018seen\u2019 \u2013 and still feels revolutionary. By the same token, Doonan believes the social impact that Drag Race has had in educating non-LGBTQ+ audiences about the community is profound \u2013 highlighting, through the contestants and their backstories, issues from body image to the battle for civil rights and homophobic violence. \u201cIt\u2019s reaching and preaching to a wide audience of people who are inevitably becoming more accepting.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while its value on that front may seem self-evident, it is also arguable that the visibility it offers to LGBTQ+ artists, and by extension, the community, may, in some ways, be counter-productive. Al-Kadhi wonders whether the show has in fact \u201cled a little bit to straight people tokenising [us] and then coming to a drag show and wanting to [just] watch someone do the splits.\u201d They add that they don\u2019t see the idea of drag going mainstream as a worry \u2013 they are only concerned about it being watered down in the process. \u201cIf it\u2019s mainstream, but it still has political bite, then that\u2019s great, but if it\u2019s just drag queens standing on a Pride float for decoration, then I just think that\u2019s emptying it out of its politics. I want a drag queen to go on TV and say something that will humiliate that TV company and reveal something \u2026 not just go on and look pretty and be fabulous \u2026 I think my feeling is that [drag performers] should always be political and if they\u2019re not, then I\u2019m not really that interested.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe future of drag\n\nIn any case, like all pop-cultural phenomena, Drag Race will undoubtedly have a shelf life. There has been a degree of jokey exasperation among fans that, with its two US series a year, as well as all the spin-offs now to come, it has already reached overkill \u2013 though, conversely, the amount of conversation it still generates suggests interest isn\u2019t about to slope off anytime soon. It may have to shake up the formula in order to stay fresh, though, and that could be why in the end, cynics might suggest, doing better on diversity will simply become good business sense. That\u2019s to say, as the selection of queens becomes ever more wearily familiar, the show may come to realise that widening its talent pool is key to its survival.\n\nWhatever the fate of Drag Race though, and whether drag\u2019s mainstream currency continues to rise or not, one thing seems sure: an artform that has always been predicated on notions of fluidity will continue to evolve. \u201cThere are always new forms coming up,\u201d says Edward, \u201cand whenever you think, what else can come [along], something else comes up and you go \u2018oh wow, oh god, yes of course\u2019. And while we\u2019re looking at this from a Western lens, in the next 10 years there are people in other countries who have not even got on the ladder of drag yet [who will come through].\u201d\n\nDrag Race UK begins on 3 October at 8pm on BBC iPlayer in the UK and on 11 October on Logo in the US.
