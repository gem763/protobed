Yep, it seems like soap bosses will be keeping us on tenterhooks over the festive period and we have zero complaints.\n\nHaiesha Mistry, who plays Yasmine Maalik in the Channel 4 soap, caught up with Metro.co.uk on the red carpet at Monday\u2019s Inside Soap Awards to give us the lowdown.\n\n\u2018Christmas is going to go off with a bang,\u2019 Haiesha began, before clearing up that the bang won\u2019t be a literal explosion because literally none of us would be able to cope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe continued to tease: \u2018There\u2019s going to be some excitement as the Hollyoaks fans love completely, but there\u2019s going to be something that will shock them.\n\n\u2018It shocked me \u2013 and I\u2019m still adjusting to it.\u2019\n\nHaiesha Mistry teased a dramatic Hollyoaks Christmas is on its way (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nBefore Christmas gets underway though, Haiesha explained that things are going to continue being tough for Yasmine after she was left deaf in last month\u2019s terrorist attack.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be really, really difficult,\u2019 she revealed. \u2018As we\u2019ve seen on-screen, they\u2019ve released an app and that\u2019s her use of communication.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s going to feel really isolated in the beginning. She can\u2019t instinctively connect with people.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m proud that we\u2019re raising the awareness that this is the reality for a lot of people,\u2019 Haeisha added.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
