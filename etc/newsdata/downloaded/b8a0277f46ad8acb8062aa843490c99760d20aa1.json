At some point, they will have to mount a legal defense.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat legal strategy?\u201d said a third Republican close to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s a delay strategy to force the Democrats to impeach on procedural grounds of obstructing the investigation. There won\u2019t be a court battle because the Democrats have no need to go to court, they will impeach for failing to provide documents.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
