As of last week, Hillary Clinton still thinks she won the 2016 election. She and her supporters believe the presidency was stolen from her by a corrupted electoral college which was manipulated by phantom Russian agents. That and sexism. Nary a mention of her conspicuous absence from the swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Stacey Abrams cannot concede last year\u2019s Georgia gubernatorial race because she cannot accept that she lost. She can\u2019t accept that a dysfunctional campaign headed by an unqualified candidate was to blame. It was voter purges and a corrupt system. That and sexism plus racism. Victimhood is the religion of the left, which is why Elizabeth Warren is trying so very hard to be the eternal victim.\n\nSince at least the mid-1980s Warren has been desperately trying to anoint herself a member of the Cherokee Nation. And it has certainly paid off for her. From 1986 until her fraud was discovered in 2012, she steadily rose through the ranks as the first Native American woman at multiple law schools. Of course, the schools in question deny that her race, misrepresented as it may be, had anything at all to do with her hiring, even though she was constantly touted as the first Native American woman. Her \u201cminority status\u201d paid off. She exploited systems designed to help victims of past discriminations, and she liked it. Until of course she felt so empowered by the media\u2019s undying defense of her distortion that she took her now famous, or infamous, DNA test.\n\nGiven her history of blatant misrepresentation, it comes as no special surprise that Senator Warren has found herself embroiled in yet another case of falsely claiming to be the victim of discrimination. For nearly a year now, at every campaign stop, she has loudly, yet erroneously, recalled the tale of her being fired from a Riverdale, NJ teaching position for being \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d in 1971. It is true that these things did happen to women in 1971. It is simply not true that it happened to Warren.\n\nUnfortunately for Warren\u2019s fantasy, the Washington Free Beacon was able to locate the actual minutes of the school board meeting where she was in fact given her job. Further frustrating her efforts for Victim of the Year, Warren sat down for an interview with UC Berkeley in 2007, stating of her past \u201cMy first-year post-graduation I worked in a public-school system with the children with disabilities. I did that for a year, and then that summer I didn\u2019t have the education courses, so I was on an \u201cemergency certificate,\u201d it was called. I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u201d I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years.\u201d Was she lying in 2007 to the liberal friendly Berkeley crowd, or has she been lying in 2019 to recoup some lost victim status from her DNA test?\n\nWarren is stuck in a seemingly never-ending cycle of victimhood. Every single action, every perceived slight is some sort of microaggression in her mind and the minds of her supporters. In February 2017, when she was on the Senate floor denouncing then Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, she chose, repeatedly, to violate Senate rules. When admonished for her overt wrongs, \u201cshe persisted\u201d became a rallying cry of the hypersensitive. The explicit implication being that Warren was only called out due to her gender, not for repeatedly and deliberately violating two-hundred years of Senate procedure. Whether it is right or wrong to chastise a Senator for misconduct is immaterial. The fact that she immediately hopped on her victimhood train is not. Warren needs to play the victim; she needs the currency within a party that values victimhood over substance.\n\nElizabeth Warren can very easily recount the past discriminations others have faced without falsely placing herself into the same category. Yet this would deprive her of that most cherished commodity, victimhood. Sure, the media will continue to carry her water and jump to her defense faster than Hillary Clinton can scream something about Russia, but that will be of little help to her come the general election. The left is quick to champion anybody who claims to be a victim, yet the public in general is not so forgiving when they find out they\u2019ve been lied to. Remember Jussie Smollett?
