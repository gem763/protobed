You made me feel like I was worth something.\"\n\nDaniel broke down in Bethany's arms and the pair embraced, leading Daniel to snog Bethany, who kissed him back.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nEventually Bethany realised the error of her ways and said \"no\", pulling away from Daniel as they gazed into each other's eyes.\n\nHowever, the pair were spotted by Ken Barlow, who scolded his son for cheating on his terminally ill wife.\n\nKen refused to listen to his son's excuses and angrily ordered Daniel to go home, while Bethany ran off in tears.\n\nWill Sinead discover her husband cheated on her?\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nCorrie viewers flocked to Twitter after watching Daniel and Bethany snog.\n\nOne viewer said: \"Bethany & Daniel seriously?

Poor Sinead\"\n\n\"I absolutely hate that corrie felt the need to have this Daniel and Bethany thing when Sinead is dying. It\u2019s so wrong.
