Also, I heard that the Nats, for the first time in 86 years, won a World Series game. A sincere congrats from this Yankees fan! We're halfway there \u2026 Thanks for waking up with us.\n\nAn old Polaroid of the O'Rourke siblings: (L-R) Erin, Charlotte and Beto O'Rourke. (Courtesy of Beto O'Rourke)\n\nThe Campaign\n\nCONNECTING THE POLICY TO THE PERSONAL: In between the campaign events, town halls, television hits, and flights across America aimed at winning the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, there\u2019s one person that Beto O\u2019Rourke always makes time to catch up with: his 39-year-old sister, Erin, who was born with intellectual disabilities.\n\nThe former Texas congressman, who once served as his younger sister\u2019s legal guardian, hops on the phone with Erin at the end of many of her workdays at CARC, Inc., a residential facility for adults and children in Carlsbad, N.M., where she lives and works. Erin watched the Democratic debate last Tuesday in which her big brother became the first 2020 contender to discuss people with disabilities on the big stage.\n\nThat time, the siblings talked the next morning.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018You did so great on the debate stage,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Rourke, 47, recalled in an interview with Power Up, the first in which he has talked in detail about his sister. \u201cAnd Erin is not shy and has no filter and will tell you exactly how it is \u2014 if I screw something up, she\u2019ll be the first to let me know. But if I do well, and make her proud, there is no greater advocate I have in my life than my sister.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke, 47, recalled in an interview with Power Up, the first in which he has talked in detail about his sister. Read the full piece here.\n\nThe proposal: So when O\u2019Rourke rolled out a portion of his disability proposal last week \u2014 a plan to expand health-care coverage of medical equipment, inspired after meeting a woman who has struggled to find a way to pay to fix her power wheelchair \u2014 it didn\u2019t just grow out of the countless meetings he\u2019s had with families, caretakers and individuals in the U.S. disability community. It was also because of Erin.\n\nThe former Texas congressman's complete disability plan is expected to be rolled out by his campaign soon: It focuses on addressing what O\u2019Rourke calls an \u201cinstitutional bias that exists in federal funding and priorities right now\u201d against those with disabilities.\n\nIt focuses on addressing what O\u2019Rourke calls an \u201cinstitutional bias that exists in federal funding and priorities right now\u201d against those with disabilities. What it does: O\u2019Rourke wants to ensure disabled individuals receive long-term home and community-based services and that the federal government provide states with additional funding for the disabled community.\n\nO\u2019Rourke wants to ensure disabled individuals receive long-term home and community-based services and that the federal government provide states with additional funding for the disabled community. The proposal will also bolster existing protections designed to support the disabled \u2014 such as funding the federal enforcement of the Supreme Court\u2019s Olmstead v. L.C. decision ruling that under the Americans With Disabilities Act, appropriate individuals with disabilities should be integrated into the community instead of being forced to live in nursing homes or institutions.\n\nO Rourke's proposal aims to \u201cstrengthen enforcement of existing civil rights laws, including the Americans With Disabilities Act,\u201d according to his campaign.\n\nPhoto of Erin and Beto O'Rourke in Austin, Texas last year. (Courtesy of Beto O'Rourke)\n\nLeading the 2020 Democrats: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s focus on increasing resources for the disabled is a bid to lay down a marker in the presidential race in which the issue has received scant attention as Democrats debate issues like health care, gun control, immigration and who is best fit to oust President Trump.\n\nO\u2019Rourke was the first of the Democratic candidates to specifically mention those with disabilities on the debate stage last week by recounting the story of meeting a woman named Gina who works four jobs and is raising a disabled child named Summer.\n\nHe has vowed that people with disabilities will serve in leadership positions in his campaign \u2014 and in a potential O\u2019Rourke administration \u2014 to mirror the fact that 1 in 4 Americans live with a disability, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u2026 especially as critics of the Trump administration say it has uniformly worked to roll back spending and programs for the disabled community:\n\nRebecca Cokley, the director of the liberal Center For American Progress\u2019s disability justice initiative, pointed to the Education Department rescinding 72 guidance documents outlining the rights of students with disabilities to the administration\u2019s attempts to slash Obamacare and Social Security disability insurance and allow states to implement eligibility requirements on Medicaid recipients.\n\nTrump\u2019s desire to dismantle the Affordable Care Act has sparked a particular urgency among disability-rights activists in Washington.\n\nHow far we've come: That O\u2019Rourke is willing to share his personal connection to the issue highlights an important evolution in the role disabled individuals play in society \u2014 and signals they are a constituency to be reckoned with, according to Cokley.\n\nEven if O'Rourke, doesn't win the 2020 nomination, he hopes Erin and the disabled community will feel they got a say in the process:\n\n\u201cErin loves that I\u2019m running for president and she\u2019s been involved in every campaign I\u2019ve run \u2014 whether it\u2019s taking the time to knock on doors with me or providing the moral support because we talk so often,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cNo matter what my day was like, I\u2019m able to talk to Erin, put things in perspective, and realize how lucky I am to be her brother.\u201d\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter. Not a regular subscriber?\n\nActing ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nThe Investigations\n\nTAYLOR DRAWS THE LINE TO TRUMP: This was far more than just that July 25 phone call, Bill Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine, told lawmakers in explosive 10-hour testimony yesterday that seems like a big pivot point in the impeachment investigation.\n\nA career civil servant, Taylor patiently recreated a timeline ripe with repeated actions by Trump's political allies and later the president himself to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his new administration to intervene in U.S. politics, our colleagues Greg Jaffe and Greg Miller report.\n\nYou can read Taylor's entire 15-page opening statement, first obtained by our colleagues, here.\n\nWithin days of being on the job in Kyiv, Taylor \u201cbegan to detect signs of an 'irregular, informal' diplomatic channel competing with his own, and a secret agenda seeping into U.S. policy. Upon arrival, he wrote, he faced 'a weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances.'\n\nIn Taylor's telling, \u201c the squeeze on Ukraine, and Trump\u2019s role in it, goes well beyond a single phone call July 25 between the U.S. president and Zelensky,\u201d our colleague Dan Balz reports .\n\nthe squeeze on Ukraine, and Trump\u2019s role in it, goes well beyond a single phone call July 25 between the U.S. president and Zelensky,\u201d our colleague Dan Balz reports \u201cTrump\u2019s long-standing characterization that there was no quid pro quo runs smack into evidence to the contrary,\u201d Balz writes.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nTaylor says Trump gave the order to halt U.S. aid to Ukraine: \u201cI and others sat in astonishment-the Ukrainians were fighting the Russians and counted on not only the training and weapons, but also the assurance of U.S. support,\u201d Taylor said in his opening statement, referring to another July call in which an Office of Management and Budget staffer notes that $391 million in U.S. aid was being withheld. \u201cAll that the OMB staff person said was that the directive had come from the President to the Chief of Staff to OMB.\u201d Taylor testified Trump wanted Zelensky to make a public statement about political investigations: Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who has also testified in the impeachment probe, \u201csaid he had talked to President Trump as I had suggested a week earlier, but that [Trump] was adamant that [Zelensky], himself, had to 'clear things up and do it in public,'\" Taylor says of a said.\"[Trump] said it was not a 'quid pro quo.'\" But Taylor described a quid pro quo: \u201cBy mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting [Zelensky] wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by [Trump personal attorney Rudy] Giuliani.\" A 'stalemate': \u201cAmbassador Sondland said that he had talked to [Zelensky] and [Andre Yermak, a top Zelensky aide] and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if [Zelensky] did not 'clear things up' in public, we would be at a we would be at a 'stalemate.' I understood a 'stalemate' to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance.\u201d The White House response: \"[Trump] has done nothing wrong \u2014 this is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution,\u201d press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. \u201cThere was no quid pro quo. Today was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats\u2019 politically-motivated, closed door, secretive hearings.\u201d\n\nOther key quotes from Taylor's opening statement:\n\nThe reaction:\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch, leaving Taylor deposition: \u201cThis testimony is a sea change. I think it could accelerate matters... This will, I think, answer more questions than it raises. Let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d \u2014 Haley Byrd (@byrdinator) October 22, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Trump compared the impeachment probe to a lynching, sparking outrage: \u201cIn describing his impeachment as a 'lynching,' Trump managed to again prompt a political firestorm around race while frustrating members of his party and drawing condemnation from lawmakers who hold his political fate in their hands,\u201d our colleagues Colby Itkowitz and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \u201cIt was the latest example of Trump\u2019s erratic and impromptu impeachment response, which has unnerved and hamstrung Republicans tasked with trying to defend him.\u201d\n\nSome lawmakers defended the inflammatory word , most notably Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.): \u201cThis is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American,\u201d he told reporters, later clarifying that he was using the term in a political context rather than a \u201cracial\u201d one.\n\n, \u201cThis is a lynching in every sense.

Joe Biden blasted it: But the former vice president said during a 1998 CNN interview that if Republicans were not careful, the impeachment of Clinton could be viewed by history as a 'partisan lynching,'\" CNN's Nathan McDermott and Andrew Kaczynski report. Biden apologized for those comments, but argued Trump's new statement was worse.\n\nBut the former vice president said during a 1998 CNN interview that if Republicans were not careful, the impeachment of Clinton could be viewed by history as a 'partisan lynching,'\" CNN's Nathan McDermott and Andrew Kaczynski report.

The context: \u201cLynching, the extrajudicial murder of an untried suspect, usually by a mob and often by hanging, has a unique history in the United States because of its direct link to slavery and racism,\u201d our colleagues Colby Itkowitz and Toluse write. \u201cIn the United States, more than 4,700 lynchings were recorded between 1882 and 1968, according to the NAACP.\u201d\n\nMitch McConnell weighed in, denying that he told Trump the July call was perfect: \u201cWe have not had any conversations on that subject,\u201d McConnell told CBS News's Nancy Cordes. When asked if Trump was lying, McConnell added \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him, I don\u2019t recall any conversations with the president about that phone call.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the day, the White House had \"signed off on regular conference calls between senior White House aides and select Republican lawmakers to coordinate messaging and legal strategies on the House impeachment probe, one of the few proactive measures undertaken so far by West Wing officials who have been unwilling to cooperate in the investigation,\" according to the Wall Street Journal's Michael Bender and Natalie Andrews.\n\n\"The push for the calls was initiated by conservative House Freedom Caucus members, unhappy they weren\u2019t clued in to the White House thinking and concerned there wasn\u2019t a strategy for how Republican lawmakers should approach depositions during the investigation, said a House Republican aide.\"\n\nTrump's small impeachment crew: \"Trump met at the White House on Tuesday with his legal team to discuss the 'state of play' regarding the impeachment inquiry, according to a person familiar with the matter. The brief meeting included Trump personal lawyers Jay Sekulow and Marty and Jane Raskin. Rudy Giuliani, another Trump lawyer whose interactions with Ukraine have put him in the sights of congressional investigators, wasn\u2019t present, this person said.\"\n\nMitch McConnell tells @nancycordes that he did not talk to President Trump about the infamous call with Ukraine's president \u2014 contradicting Trump's claim that McConnell said the call was \"perfect\" and \"innocent\" https://t.co/H9n7JKbYS7 pic.twitter.com/6JLVkMrR8A \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) October 22, 2019\n\nImpeachment by the numbers, per CNN's Harry Enten: \"Our latest CNN poll conducted by SSRS shows that 50% of Americans and 51% of voters want [Trump t]o be impeached and removed from office. This is the highest level of support for impeaching and removing Trump from office ever recorded by CNN. Only 43% of Americans and 44% of voters are against impeaching and removing him.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s also the first time that the percentage who want to impeach and remove Trump significantly outnumbers the percentage who don\u2019t want him impeached removed.\"\n\nSome history: \"More Americans want to impeach and remove Trump from office now than Americans did at this point of the impeachment sagas of Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon.\"\n\n\"More Americans want to impeach and remove Trump from office now than Americans did at this point of the impeachment sagas of Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon.\" Also from the poll: \"Giuliani\u2019s favorable rating is lower than ever, while Nancy Pelosi\u2019s is the highest in over a decade.\"\n\nA U.S. military vehicle, part of a convoy, arrives near Dahuk, Iraqi.
