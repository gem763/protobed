Nita M. Lowey (D-NY) unexpectedly announced that she was not going to seek reelection in 2020. Lowey, 82, had represented the Westchester suburbs of New York City since 1989 and was the first woman in history to chair the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n\u201cWe have to start by asking because apparently there are rumors that you are considering running for Congress,\u201d host Whoopi Goldberg asked the Gutsy Women author at the top of the broadcast.\n\n\u201cOh, my,\u201d Clinton reacted as many in the audience cheered.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman Nita Lowey is not seeking re-election,\u201d Goldberg continued. \u201cIs that rumor? Are you thinking about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not considering running for Congress,\u201d Clinton responded to groans from the crowd.\n\nAsked why she wasn\u2019t jumping in the race, Clinton said that she\u2019s been asked a version of that question for as long as she could remember.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a question that shouldn\u2019t just be asked of someone whose last name is Clinton or Huntsman,\u201d she added, nodding to co-host Abby Huntsman, daughter of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. \u201cIt\u2019s a question we should be asking kids\u2014like, do you think about running for office one day\u2014young people, women, and I hope that if the answer to that question is, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m considering it,\u2019 that you\u2019ll really think about doing it and go to run for something and other resources that will help you do that.\u201d\n\nHuntsman went on to ask Clinton\u2014who serves on the board of directors at IAC, the parent company of The Daily Beast\u2014if she will ever run for office, prompting the presidential daughter to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but right now the answer is no.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI think it\u2019s a question that shouldn\u2019t just be asked of someone whose last name is Clinton or Huntsman,\u201d Chelsea added.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_331,w_589,x_34,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571240603/view_81_rx5a9x", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
