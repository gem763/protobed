I have my Glocks,\u201d Ms. Boebert told the man. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sir, I have your back.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke had to repeatedly ask the crowd to be respectful and let the woman finish her point.\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d she said, turning back to Mr. O\u2019Rourke. \u201cI want to know how you\u2019re going to legislate that because a criminal breaks the law, so all you\u2019re going to do is restrict law-abiding citizens, like myself. \u2026 Self-defense is a right that we have that shall not be infringed in America.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke responded by saying, \u201cI refuse to accept\u201d that people are inherently evil, The Denver Post reported.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen in any other country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 329 million of us. There are 390 million guns. No other country has this kind of ratio. No other country allows its citizens to buy weapons that were designed for war. \u2026 The logic of your argument is, Why shouldn\u2019t we allow you to have a bazooka or drive a tank down the street?\u201d\n\nThe former Texas congressman hesitated when pressed on how the buyback would work, a local CBS affiliate reported.\n\n\u201cI would expect our fellow Americans to follow the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t and they flagrantly abuse that law, yes, that weapon would be taken from them.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
