Cuts of the magnitude they\u2019re considering would undermine that foundation and throw out economy into a tailspin. So, they have an obligation to demonstrate that there is truly no other alternative.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut so far, the Kenney government is failing in this obligation. They\u2019re basing their fiscal roadmap on the MacKinnon report, which is NOT really an objective assessment of Alberta\u2019s public-sector finances. Instead, it\u2019s a thinly-veiled ideological screed, aimed at providing political cover for a government that\u2019s already made up its mind to cut regardless of the need or the consequences.\u201d\n\nMcGowan says that while Janice MacKinnon may be a darling of the political right in Canada, her report is filled with distortions and outright lies about public services, public-sector spending and public-sector wages.\n\n\u201cIf you have bad information, you\u2019re going to end up making bad decisions. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with the UCP and the MacKinnon report, right now,\u201d says McGowan.\n\n\u201cThis is most certainly NOT the way we should be making critical decisions about the public services and public-sector infrastructure that form such an important part of the foundation of our economy.\u201d\n\nAs a service to Albertans, McGowan says the AFL has prepared a list of the top 10 lies and distortions being used by the UCP to support their political narrative that there is no alternative to deep cuts. Here is the list.\n\n\u201cBoth citizens and members of the media should carry this list around with them over the next month or two to act as a shield and antidote against the avalanche of b***s*** that\u2019s about to be dumped on them,\u201d concludes McGowan.\n\nMEDIA CONTACT:\n\nRamona Franson\n\nDirector of Communications\n\nrfranson@afl.org\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Alberta Federation Of Labour"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/480813?filename=480813.png&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
