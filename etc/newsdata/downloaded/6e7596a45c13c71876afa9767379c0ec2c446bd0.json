Is the number of people at work today the same as yesterday? Probably not. Across the world, standard workweeks are already taking new shape and the United States is jumping on the bandwagon with Summer Friday initiatives and flexible hour scheduling.\n\nIt won\u2019t be long before all of corporate America adopts four-day workweeks to increase productivity and boost company morale, while minimizing the risk of burnout and business profit loss.\n\nSetting up shorter workweeks was a hot topic turned dream pursuit and now, it\u2019s steadily becoming a reality. It appears to be the solution to perfecting work/life harmony in a labor market where modern employees crave ownership over their schedules and greater social freedom to experience, you know \u2026life.\n\nThe new workplace has already edged itself into a state of flexibility that gifts employees the opportunity to work remotely, use paid time off guilt-free, and come early or late depending on the time of day their brain functions best.\n\nFour-day workweeks are the natural next step and just may be the solution to both depleted productivity levels and the onset of burnout. Oh, and trust me: no one is disputing that the hourly adjustment wouldn\u2019t come with some kinks to work out. The benefits of the four-day workweek far surpass that short, uncomfortable time period of transition and it\u2019s undeniably favorable to all incoming work generations.\n\nIs a shorter workweek the key to happiness?\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: if we give employees an inch, they\u2019ll eventually take a mile. It starts with a four-day workweek that turns into three, and then two, then maybe even none.\n\nA study published in the Social Science and Medicine Journal by researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of Salford that shows that a one-day workweek reduces mental health issues by 30 percent. To be perfectly frank, a one-day workweek isn\u2019t sustainable or practical for any company, especially not a high-growth startup with the relative competition. Although, the cutback on standard work hours and its effect on employee happiness shouldn\u2019t be discounted.\n\nCompanies should keep in mind that a four-day workweek implies their commitment to mental wellbeing in the workplace, allowing employees to dial back external stress or pressure they would now be able to manage on a Friday or another day of the week.\n\nIn 2000, the BLS began recording what\u2019s known as the quits rate, and the number of employee quits has increased for nine consecutive years. This year, an estimated 40 percent of people will quit their job. It pays to keep your people happy and let\u2019s be honest; a thriving state of mental health is invaluable. Companies need to prioritize their employees\u2019 happiness and the numbers make a convincing case for shorter workweeks as the antidote to burnout and a cyclical quitting economy.\n\nHow can companies switch to four-day workweeks?\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the stats, and now you\u2019re convinced! It\u2019s time for a four-day workweek to get your people pumped and productive. The transition process might be a bit bumpy, so you need to formulate a plan of action that effectively changes your employees\u2019 schedule without upsetting or inconveniencing them.\n\nScaling up can be done smoothly. For companies looking to adopt a four-day workweek policy, it\u2019s best to initiate the new schedule by shortening weeks in the summer. Those companies who still operate at full capacity can integrate more remote or part-time employees if there are excessive or unexpected quarterly goals to be met.\n\nRegardless of the tight labor market, vacancies will be easier to fill, as most people see shorter workweeks as an unbeatable perk. By starting out with shorter summer workweeks, you\u2019re given the chance to acclimate your staff to a new way of living, which will also prove to be beneficial when the holiday season comes around; they\u2019ll want to spend the extra day off with their loved ones.\n\nA four-day workweek that dials down burnout is bound to ignite productivity. Along with those higher levels of productivity, comes a stronger company culture, positive employee relationships, and an elevated understanding of certain tools that make the five-day workweek unnecessary and eventually obsolete; even England is on track to instate a national four-day week by 2050.\n\nBut, will the same amount of work get done?\n\nProductivity and communication tools are also available so employees can stay connected to coworkers and clients even while out of the office. This is changing corporate culture and its established structure, but that\u2019s a good thing. The traditional 9-to-5 mentality that once sucked employees dry of their energy, drive, and creativity, is bouncing back with a vengeance, and the four-day workweek makes ample legroom for these to take precedent over time.\n\nWorking from home is pretty much becoming the norm these days, for reasons that include \u2014 well, managers and HR don\u2019t actually feel they need to stick their nose in people\u2019s business anymore. So, that\u2019s a moot explanation.\n\nThe point is that working from home as a best office practice hasn\u2019t just increased work quality, but introduced the modern workplace to any productivity and communication tools needed for collaboration, growth, and overall company success.\n\nKeeping your teams connected and prioritizing time management those four \u201con\u201d days via project and time management tools will prove just irrelevant that new \u201coff\u201d day is. Digital tools that streamline workflow make four-day workweeks seem less criminal and hopefully, with time, will prove to skeptics that it\u2019s really the only way to work effectively in the long term sense.\n\nWhat do four-day workweeks mean for the future of work?\n\nCompanies are finally focusing more on employee happiness and wellbeing. Wellness isn\u2019t just a top perk that attracts the best talent, it\u2019s becoming a staple in people retention. Four-day workweeks are the gateway to wellness goals that companies are trying to reach.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to just offer a yoga program or keep fruits in the fridge (which you should definitely still be doing); employees appreciate a gesture that allows them to be present in their lives outside of work, and the four-day workweek is a cure for that FOMO illness we get when stuck inside the office.\n\nInstating four-day workweeks worldwide can bring added value to younger generations who are renovating the workforce structure with their expectations and preferences for meaningful experiences that make an impact, both in their job and at home. With the quitting economy hosting a two-year employment rate for the average millennial, four-day workweeks could alter that stat.\n\nWhy? Because we now have proof that confirms that the happiness quotient can excel with one extra day per week to recharge. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to stand out by putting employees and their needs first? Plus, you might save a bit of money on the bills by turning those office lights off on Thursday nights instead of Friday.", "description": "The transition process might be a bit bumpy, but scaling up can be done smoothly.
