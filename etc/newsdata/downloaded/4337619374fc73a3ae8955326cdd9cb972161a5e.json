The whistle-blower is a C.I.A. officer, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nCorrection: September 26, 2019\n\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the C.I.A. general counsel. She is Courtney Simmons Elwood, not Ellwood.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House learned that a C.I.A. officer had lodged allegations against President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine even as the officer\u2019s whistle-blower complaint was moving through a process meant to protect him against reprisals, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.\n\nThe officer first shared information about potential abuse of power and a White House cover-up with the C.I.A.\u2019s top lawyer through an anonymous process, some of the people said. The lawyer shared the officer\u2019s concerns with White House and Justice Department officials, following policy. Around the same time, the officer separately filed the whistle-blower complaint.\n\nThe revelations provide new insight about how the officer\u2019s allegations moved through the bureaucracy of government. The Trump administration\u2019s handling of the accusations is certain to be scrutinized, particularly by lawmakers weighing the impeachment of the president.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nLawyers for the whistle-blower refused to confirm that he worked for the C.I.A. and said that publishing information about him was dangerous.\n\n\u201cAny decision to report any perceived identifying information of the whistle-blower is deeply concerning and reckless, as it can place the individual in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Andrew Bakaj, his lead counsel. \u201cThe whistle-blower has a right to anonymity.\u201d\n\nNeither the White House nor the National Security Council, its foreign policy arm, responded to requests for comment. The C.I.A. referred questions to the inspector general for the intelligence agencies, Michael Atkinson, who declined to comment.\n\nA spokeswoman for the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, said that protecting the whistle-blower was his office\u2019s highest priority. \u201cWe must protect those who demonstrate the courage to report alleged wrongdoing, whether on the battlefield or in the workplace,\u201d Mr. Maguire said at a hearing on Thursday, adding that he did not know the whistle-blower\u2019s identity.\n\nDean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, said The Times was right to publish information about the whistle-blower. \u201cThe president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding,\u201d Mr. Baquet said. \u201cThe president himself has called the whistle-blower\u2019s account a \u2018political hack job.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Baquet added, \u201cWe decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower \u2014 including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House \u2014 because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible. We also understand that the White House already knew he was a C.I.A. officer.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Brittainy Newman/The New York Times President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.\n\nDuring his time at the White House, the whistle-blower became deeply unnerved about how he believed Mr. Trump was broadly seeking to pressure the Ukrainian government to conduct investigations that could benefit him politically. \u201cNamely, he sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the president\u2019s 2020 re-election bid,\u201d said the complaint, which was released on Thursday .\n\nDuring a July 25 call, Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his younger son and other matters that the president saw as potentially beneficial to him politically, according to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House on Wednesday.\n\nThe whistle-blower was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity, and has since returned to the C.I.A.\n\nHis complaint suggested he was an analyst by training and made clear he was steeped in details of American foreign policy toward Europe, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics and at least some knowledge of the law.\n\nThe whistle-blower\u2019s expertise will most likely add to lawmakers\u2019 confidence about the merits of his complaint and tamp down allegations that he might have misunderstood what he learned about Mr. Trump. He did not listen directly to the July call, but some White House colleagues told him that they were concerned they had witnessed \u201cthe president abuse his office for personal gain,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nThe week after the call, the officer delivered a somewhat broad accusation anonymously to the C.I.A.\u2019s general counsel, Courtney Simmons Elwood , according to multiple people familiar with the events. The initial allegations reported only that serious questions existed about a phone call between Mr. Trump and a foreign leader.\n\nAs required by government policy, Ms. Elwood had to assess whether a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for the accusation existed. During the preliminary inquiry, Ms. Elwood and a career C.I.A. lawyer learned that multiple people had raised concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s call.\n\nMs. Elwood also called John A. Eisenberg, a deputy White House counsel and her counterpart at the National Security Council, according to three people familiar with the matter. He was already aware of vague concerns about the call.\n\nMs. Elwood, Mr. Eisenberg and their deputies spoke multiple times the following week. They decided that the accusations had a reasonable basis.\n\nMr. Eisenberg and Ms. Elwood both spoke on Aug. 14 to John Demers, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, according to three people familiar with the discussion. Ms. Elwood did not pass on the name of the C.I.A. officer, which she did not know because his concerns were submitted anonymously.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Demers went to the White House to read the transcript of the call and assess whether to alert other senior law enforcement officials. The deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, and Brian A. Benczkowski, the head of the department\u2019s criminal division, were soon looped in, according to two administration officials.\n\nDepartment officials began to discuss the accusations and whether and how to follow up, and Attorney General William P. Barr learned of the allegations around that time, according to a person familiar with the matter. Although Mr. Barr was briefed, he did not oversee the discussions about how to proceed, the person said.\n\nBut as White House, C.I.A. and Justice Department officials were examining the accusations, the C.I.A. officer who had lodged them anonymously grew concerned after learning that Ms. Elwood had contacted the White House, according to two people familiar with the matter. While it is not clear how the officer became aware that Ms. Elwood had shared the information, he concluded that the C.I.A. was not taking his allegations seriously.\n\nThat played a factor in his decision to become a whistle-blower, they said. And about two weeks after first submitting his anonymous accusations, he decided to file a whistle-blower complaint to Mr. Atkinson, a step that offers special legal protections , unlike going to a general counsel.\n\nMs. Elwood and Mr. Eisenberg learned only later about the complaint, filed on Aug. 12 , and did not know it was sent by the same officer who had sent the information anonymously to her.\n\nAt the end of August, the office of the director of national intelligence referred the allegations to the Justice Department as a possible criminal matter. Law enforcement officials ultimately declined to open an investigation.\n\nThe revelation that the White House knew that a C.I.A. officer was expressing concerns before he filed a whistle-blower complaint demonstrates a weakness in a law meant to protect him from reprisals and shows that he was at risk of retaliation.\n\n\u201cI always advise whistle-blowers against going to general counsels because the general counsels have to report the matter,\u201d said Dan Meyer, the former executive director of the intelligence community whistle-blowing program and managing partner at the law firm Tully Rinckey\u2019s Washington office. \u201cThey are like tuna in a shark tank.\u201d\n\nMr. Maguire defended the government\u2019s handling of the complaint, noting the whistle-blower\u2019s accusations had been delivered to Congress and the reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s call had been released. \u201cEverything here in this matter is totally unprecedented,\u201d he said at the hearing.\n\nSpeaking to State Department employees at a closed-door meeting, Mr. Trump said the whistle-blower was \u201calmost a spy,\u201d according to a person briefed on what took place, and said he wanted to identify his sources, suggesting that punishment awaited them.\n\nThe whistle-blower has identified at least a half-dozen government officials \u2014 including several who work for the White House \u2014 who he believes can substantiate his claims. The inspector general has interviewed some of the people and found the whistle-blower\u2019s claims credible.\n\nAgents, officers and analysts from the military, intelligence and law enforcement communities routinely work at the White House. Often, they work on the National Security Council or help manage secure communications, like calls between the president and foreign leaders.\n\nThe C.I.A. officer did not work on the communications team that handles calls with foreign leaders, according to the people familiar with his identity. He learned about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct \u201cin the course of official interagency business,\u201d according to the complaint, which was dotted with footnotes about machinations in Kiev and reinforced with public comments by senior Ukrainian officials.\n\nOfficials regularly shared information to \u201cinform policymaking and analysis,\u201d the complaint said. It raises the prospect that the whistle-blower was not detailed to the White House either during the events in question or when he learned about them.\n\nAfter the call, multiple officials told the whistle-blower that future talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky would depend on whether the Ukranians would \u201cplay ball\u201d on the investigations.", "description": "The White House learned that a C.I.A. officer had lodged allegations against President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine even as the officer\u2019s whistle-blower complaint was moving through a process meant to protect him against reprisals, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHTu8P.img?h=169&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=842&y=338"}
