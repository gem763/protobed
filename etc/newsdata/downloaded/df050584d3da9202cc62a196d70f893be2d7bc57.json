Police are searching for a 16- to 20-year old man in a black hooded top who fled the scene on foot.\n\nWiersum, 44, was acting for Nabil Bakkali, a crown witness in a case against 16 men accused of five murders between 2015 and 2017, whose brother was also shot dead last year shortly after authorities named Bakkali as a witness.\n\nDutch media compared Wiersum\u2019s killing to the targeted Mafia assassinations of investigating magistrates in Italy in the 1990s or the lawless Colombia under the drugs baron Pablo Escobar.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman lays flowers near the home of the murdered lawyer Derk Wiersum in Amsterdam on Thursday.

Calling for a new approach to organised crime, the national police chief, Erik Akerboom, said Dutch society \u201ccannot accept this. A line has been crossed.\u201d\n\nThe mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, described the murder as \u201ca shock for our society, because the victim was doing his job and it\u2019s a very important job in our constitutional state\u201d, while the prime minister, Mark Rutte, called the shooting \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d.\n\nThe Dutch counter-terrorism agency, NCTV, has been put in charge of the investigation into Wiersum\u2019s murder.\n\nConcern has been growing over increased violent crime levels in Amsterdam, where recreational drug use has long been tolerated, creating a flourishing underworld of dealers and suppliers. A leading police union said the situation was out of control.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amsterdam\u2019s red-light district at night.

Eleven men, all alleged members of a cocaine-smuggling gang, are in custody, including Bakkali, who has provided police with more than 1,500 pages of statements against the group in exchange for a more lenient sentence.\n\nThe AD newspaper said the murder marked the beginning of a \u201cnew, dark phase\u201d for the country, adding that although in the Netherlands \u201cthe prime minister still cycles to work\u201d and lawyers, judges and prosecutors \u201cmove unguarded through life \u2026 the underworld has just strengthened its hold on the upper world\u201d.\n\nDark web blamed for rise in drugs sent by post from Netherlands Read more\n\nThe paper said that despite plenty of government money and declarations of good intent, authorities \u201cdo not yet have a grip on the threat\u201d, leaving police and justice officials \u201cat the mercy of a narco-state over which the government has no control\u201d.\n\nThe NRC Handelsblad newspaper said the Netherlands was \u201cnaive\u201d in its approach to drugs, citing EU policing officials and unnamed sources in the drugs world, particularly Colombia, who allege the country is \u201cthe logistical centre for the cocaine trade in western Europe\u201d.\n\nThe paper said that based on the 70,000kg cocaine seized in the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam in 2018, at least 200,000kg must have been brought successfully into the Netherlands, worth an estimated \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.4bn).\n\nNRC said it was doubtful whether authorities had yet fully grasped the extent of the impact of such sums on Dutch society. \u201cPut simply,\u201d the paper said, \u201cthat kind of money buys anything \u2013 cars and nice houses, but also contract killers and corrupt officials.\u201d.\n\nJohn van den Heuvel, a crime correspondent who has been given police protection when reporting on Dutch gangs, told state radio he was \u201cextremely concerned, again, at the way in which organised crime is underestimated in the Netherlands. Of everything I\u2019ve experienced, this is an absolute low.\u201d", "description": "Lawyers in gangland cases given emergency protection after unprecedented killing", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/297399d89e73eb162d05288988d5888130341dea/0_357_6291_3777/master/6291.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0088a4d6361fcd11e05b99a9f6167e08", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
