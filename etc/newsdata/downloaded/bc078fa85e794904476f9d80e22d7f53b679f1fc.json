Superstardom saw him transform from a poor 12-year-old who busked singing hymns in his hometown of Stratford, Ontario, to a wealthy but troubled young man who has had multiple run-ins with the law . He is still just 25. Had he attended, Bieber would not long be out of college. Now, four years since he first toyed with the idea of saying sorry in time to a preposterously catchy beat , Justin Bieber is doing it for real.\n\nHolly Thomas\n\nThe boyish superstar posted a raw essay on his Instagram page on Monday, amounting to a catalog of his past wrongdoings. These included \"heavy\" drug use, disrespecting women, abusing his relationships, and letting his extraordinary fame and wealth at a very young age go to his head. It was an emotive and sincere outpouring of remorse, a sentiment too often left unexpressed.\n\nBy facing up to his faults -- and correctly identifying their genesis, he has shown more humility than men of twice his years. In fact, he's demonstrating more personal responsibility than two of the most powerful people on the planet.\n\nIt may seem extreme to compare a pop superstar like Justin Bieber to prime ministers and presidents -- that's because it is. To do so also makes a necessary and warranted point about what so many of us have grown numb to -- the lack of accountability for those in power. Bieber lives in the world of entertainment, but his willingness to apologize for his actions in a highly public way shines a spotlight on the fact that too often, in the world of politics, a refusal to say sorry is admired, even rewarded, in those who hold high office.", "description": "While it may seem extreme to compare Justin Bieber's public apology to Boris Johnson's and Donald Trump's total lack thereof, that's the point, says Holly Thomas. We've grown numb to people in power not taking responsibility, and Bieber's raw essay is an important reminder that in the world of politics, being unapologetic isn't an asset we should reward.", "authors": ["Opinion Holly Thomas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190905130046-bieber-trump-johnson-split-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
