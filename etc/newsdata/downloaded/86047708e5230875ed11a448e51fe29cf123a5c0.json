Disney considered mutual business and advertising opportunities with other companies when making decisions about allowing them to show ads on Disney networks, a source with knowledge of the situation said to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nNetflix declined to comment to The Wall Street Journal, and Disney said it went back on its original plan to prohibit ads from rival streaming services \"to reflect the comprehensive business relationships we have with many of these companies.\" (Neither company responded immediately to a request for further comment from Business Insider.)\n\nThe streaming wars are growing fierce, with Disney and other legacy media brands launching their own services in the coming months.\n\nFollowing the Disney Plus launch in November, HBO and NBCUniversal plan to have HBO Max and Peacock respectively up and running in early 2020.\n\nSome of the most popular shows that have found their home on Netflix for years \u2014 from \"Friends\" to \"The Office\" to \"Parks and Recreation\" \u2014 are now changing hands between streaming services.\n\nIn addition to spending billions on licensing for these shows as well developing original content, media companies are also reserving large chunks of their budgets \u2014 stretching into the hundreds of millions \u2014 for advertising.", "description": "Media brands have been battling for content licenses as new streaming services launch, and now ad deals are part of the streaming wars, too.", "authors": ["Alyssa Meyers"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d13c637e3ecba0e4b7d6e65?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
