He should be impeached Jul\u00edan Castro\n\nPogrebin and Kelly wrote: \u201cWhile we found Dr Ford\u2019s allegations credible during a 10-month investigation, Ms Ramirez\u2019s story could be more fully corroborated. During his Senate testimony, Mr Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been \u2018the talk of campus\u2019. Our reporting suggests that it was.\u201d\n\nThe reporters also said they had \u201cuncovered a previously unreported story about Mr Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms Ramirez\u2019s allegation\u201d.\n\nA classmate, they wrote, \u201csaw Mr Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student\u201d.\n\nThe Times said senators and the FBI were notified about that claim but it was not investigated.\n\nKavanaugh vehemently denied all allegations against him. He was confirmed on a 50-48 vote, the narrowest for a supreme court pick in more than a century. As Trump\u2019s second pick, he has tilted the court firmly to the right.\n\nPogrebin and Kelly\u2019s book comes on the heels of another book by Times reporters, She Said by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, about the investigation and downfall of Harvey Weinstein, which triggered the #MeToo movement.\n\nNews of the new claim against Kavanaugh and the investigation of the known one touched off a social media firestorm. On Sunday morning, Trump duly fired back.\n\nDemocrats and the media, he said, were \u201ctalking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!\u201d\n\nCalls for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment have surfaced periodically since his confirmation.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for liable [sic], or the justice department should come to his rescue Donald Trump\n\nOn Saturday, former Obama housing secretary and Democratic presidential candidate Jul\u00edan Castro tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\u201d\n\nAnother candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, was asked on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday if she thought Kavanaugh should be impeached.\n\n\u201cI strongly oppose him,\u201d she said, \u201cbased on his views on the executive power which will continue to haunt our country, as well as how he behaved, including the allegations that we are hearing more about today. My concern here is that the process was a sham.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Trump appeared to suggest the justice department should act at his behest to aid a political ally, a highly irregular if familiar stance.\n\nShe Said: an inside look at the story that brought down Harvey Weinstein Read more\n\n\u201cBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for liable [sic], or the justice department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\u201d\n\nIt seems doubtful that Kavanaugh, a strict conservative who served in the George W Bush administration, will change his views any time soon. Nor is his removal likely \u2013 Republicans have a strong hold on the Senate, which would have to convict him in any impeachment process.\n\nThe impeachment of supreme court justices works in the same way as that of a president: a majority of the House must approve and a two-thirds majority of the Senate must convict.\n\nLower judges have been removed but only one impeachment of a supreme court justice been attempted. It was of Samuel Chase, appointed by George Washington, in 1804. He survived.", "description": "New York Times details known and new claims against judge, leading Jul\u00edan Castro to say: \u2018Kavanaugh lied under oath.
