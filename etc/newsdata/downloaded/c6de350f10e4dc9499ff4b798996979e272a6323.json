USA TODAY\n\nIt\u2019s Week 7 of the fantasy football season. If you are looking for an unexpected roster replacement or an inexpensive starter for your daily fantasy lineup, here are players who could help.\n\nThese deep sleepers are players flying under the radar whose matchups suggest they could have a big game in Week 7. Just remember, they are risky fantasy plays given the other options likely available.\n\nQB Jimmy Garoppolo, San Francisco 49ers\n\nIt hasn't been the best of starts for Garoppolo, who's thrown for over 200 yards in a game three times and thrown for multiple touchdowns twice in five games. This week, Garoppolo plays a Washington Redskins defense allowing 267 passing yards and over two touchdowns per game.\n\nWEEK 7 FANTASY RANKINGS:How players stack up at each position\n\nSan Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has completed 70% of his passes this season with seven TDs and five interceptions. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWhile the 49ers are expected to run the football a lot this week, they won\u2019t run the football the entire game. Garoppolo should throw for over 200 yards and record his third multi-touchdown game for a top-10 fantasy finish.\n\nRB Latavius Murray, New Orleans Saints\n\nMurray had 11 touches last week, his most this season. Starter Alvin Kamara might not play this week, but even if he does, Murray should get the lion\u2019s share of the rushing work with the Chicago Bears defense missing run-stuffer Akeem Hicks.\n\nMurray could top 20 touches and looks good for 100-plus all-purpose yards and a touchdown, making him as solid RB2 who could dance with RB1 fantasy points this week.\n\nWR Cole Beasley, Buffalo Bills\n\nBeasley has posted double-digit fantasy points in point-per-reception leagues in three of five weeks. Yet, he\u2019s barely owned in most fantasy formats. This week, Beasley and the entire Bills passing offense should thrive against a Miami Dolphins defense allowing 161 yards and nearly two touchdowns per game to wide receivers. Beasley should easily post double-digit points in PPR leagues. Expect Beasley to total 60 to 100 yards and score his first touchdown of the season.\n\nTE Darren Fells, Houston Texans\n\nIt\u2019s a tough week to select a tight end not among the top six or seven in fantasy football and still feel confident in your choice. Over the past two weeks, Fells has two touchdowns in one and six catches for 69 yards in the other.\n\nFells plays against an Indianapolis Colts defense that hardly defends the tight end. Expect the Texans to game plan Fells into the offense, giving him a shot at six receptions for 60 yards and another touchdown.\n\nNew York Giants defense/special teams\n\nBefore their bye week, the Giants totaled nine sacks, two touchdowns, five interceptions and two fumble recoveries \u2014 making them one of the better defenses over that time frame.\n\nAt home this week, the Giants play an Arizona Cardinals offense which, while good, has struggled on the road. In two away games, Kyler Murray has thrown for 301 yards, but with zero touchdowns. With an extra week to get ready for this game, the Giants defense is in line for another great week including a top-10 fantasy finish.\n\nJim Saranteas, aka \"The Fantasy Greek,\" is a contributing writer for Ourlads.com, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
