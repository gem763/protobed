In the past eight years I have had six general anaesthetics and my memory is not as good as it once was. Or is my memory loss down to old age? I am 72.\n\nStuart Ballard, by email.\n\nYou and many others will be reassured to hear that general anaesthetics are not a proven cause of long-term memory loss.\n\nAlthough there is much debate on the subject, there is no evidence that the drugs used in anaesthesia cause damage to the tissue of the brain.\n\nYour concern is not unusual, however. It is a universal experience that after the age of about 50, people find their memory is not as sharp as it used to be. They tend to have particular trouble remembering names and recent events, such as what they had for lunch yesterday.\n\nThere is no evidence that drugs used in anaesthesia cause damage to the tissue of the brain\n\nIt\u2019s a common issue that people see their GP about. Like you, they often voice anxieties about anaesthetic \u2014 after all, so many people in this age group will have had surgery or will be scheduled to have an operation \u2014 or they\u2019re worried their memory has been affected by prescribed medication.\n\nIn the background, there is the fear that dementia is on the horizon. Yet these sorts of memory difficulties can be a normal part of the ageing process: brain scans of elderly people suggest the brain shrinks with age.\n\nIt is a matter of judgment and considerable expertise for doctors to differentiate between normal ageing and a condition known as mild cognitive impairment, an intermediate state between normal function and early dementia.\n\nThe cornerstone of the evaluation is the medical consultation. This face-to-face examination gives the patient\u2019s GP a sense of the extent of the problem and enables them to make comparisons with others of the same age.\n\nMany people voice their anxieties about anaesthetic to their GPs\n\nIt is one reason why it is so important to be seen by a doctor who knows you and has followed you over the years.\n\nThere are also screening tests available that GPs, neurologists and psychiatrists use, for instance a questionnaire called the mini-mental state examination. This includes questions about the date and time; it also tests the patient\u2019s ability to recall a list of words, to do mental arithmetic and to spell a word backwards.\n\nWhen the result of this test is abnormal it will be followed by more detailed neuro- psychological testing. This usually involves longer tests under the care of a clinical psychologist, who will use questionnaires to determine which areas of cognitive function are affected.\n\nThe patient may also undergo a CT or magnetic resonance brain imaging scan to check for cerebrovascular disease (where there are problems with blood supply to the brain \u2014 a possible cause of dementia) and other issues.\n\nIt would be unwise of me to venture an opinion about your own situation, but from what you have told me it is worth having a conversation with your GP.\n\nI must stress again, however, that general anaesthetic is unlikely to have been the cause.\n\nI had my gallbladder removed a year ago and now my wife needs hers removed. Is this normal? Or could there be something else going on in both of us that we should be tested for?\n\nAlan Daly, by email.\n\nThe gallbladder is a reservoir for storing bile \u2014 a fluid that helps with digestion \u2014 that has formed in the liver.\n\nIf it starts to malfunction (for reasons that are not fully understood), then small stones \u2014 usually made of cholesterol \u2014 can form inside it, potentially triggering symptoms such as pain in the abdomen and vague sensations such as bloating, heartburn, acidity and belching.\n\nThe diseased gallbladder can also become infected \u2014 known as acute cholecystitis.\n\nIf the gall bladder starts to malfunction then small stones can start to appear inside it\n\nSymptoms and infection are not inevitable, but once they do start to occur then the recommended treatment is to remove the gallbladder (known as cholecystectomy).\n\nYour body does not actually need a gallbladder, and after the operation the digestive system will adapt and function normally.Gallstone disease is common. Around 6 per cent of men and 9 per cent of women are thought to have gallstones, though only about 20 per cent of those with stones will develop symptoms.\n\nTo answer your question we need to look at the risk factors for developing gallstone disease, and there are many of these.\n\nAge is the major risk factor (stones usually develop in middle age). Being female is a risk factor, as is being pregnant or having been pregnant in the past, because oestrogen, the female sex hormone, alters the chemistry of the bile. For the same reason, taking oral contraceptives or HRT also increases the risk.\n\nFamily history is a risk factor along with obesity, diabetes and cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and having a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nGiven the frequency of this condition, and the numerous risk factors, the fact that both you and your wife have developed gallstones does not suggest either of you has a sinister underlying condition. Although you may lead similar lifestyles, it is basically a coincidence, and your respective risk factors will be somewhere in that long list. There is no reason to undergo any other investigations.\n\nBy the way... The men who MUST have cancer tests\n\nWhen prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing was introduced some 30 years ago, doctors were pleased at last to have a means of screening men for prostate cancer.\n\nMost don\u2019t have symptoms until the cancer has spread, so being able to identify \u2014 and therefore treat \u2014 it early seemed like the Holy Grail had been found.\n\nBut it soon transpired that this test (which measures levels of a protein produced by the gland) was a false dawn.\n\nIt transpired that the tests for prostate cancer introduced 30 years ago were a false dawn\n\nStudies in subsequent years have cast a shadow over it, on account of the high false positive rate \u2014 more than 20 per cent of men with a raised PSA do not have prostate cancer at all (raised levels can also be a sign of an enlarged prostate, for example).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, although a positive test in some men does indicate cancer, a proportion of those tumours are so slow growing as to never be life-threatening. This can lead to a situation in which treatment is more disabling than the cancer itself \u2014 in other words, the test has led to over-diagnosis.\n\nMedical professionals are still divided about the effectiveness of PSA testing and the ratio of benefits versus harm.\n\nThe best summary of the evidence is that for every 1,000 men who undergo screening several times each over ten or more years, one death from prostate cancer will be avoided.\n\nScreening must be structured to the risks of the individual and not simply a blanket edict\n\nBut that is set against the many men who will be damaged by radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy and other cancer treatments, which carry the risk of urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel problems.\n\nHowever, it now seems that the pendulum has swung too far the other way.\n\nAs many as one in ten men who request PSA screening are turned down by their GPs, the charity Prostate Cancer UK reported last week. Yet we know that about one in eight men will get prostate cancer, rising to one in four men who have a family history of the disease (such as a brother or father who had it).\n\nThese are the very men who should be screened, along with those with family history of the faulty BRCA gene and black men (all these groups have a significantly higher risk).\n\nWhat all this means is that doctors and patients must bear in mind what I so often bang on about on these pages: screening must be structured to the risks of the individual and not simply a blanket edict.\n\nCare must be taken to go through the patient\u2019s history so that doctor and patient can decide, together, whether to screen or not. And that takes time.\n\nWRITE TO DR SCURR\n\nTo contact Dr Scurr with a health query, write to him at Good Health, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London, W8 5TT or email drmartin@dailymail.co.uk - including contact details.
