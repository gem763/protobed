The suit was filed in federal court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nThe suit doesn\u2019t seek to prevent the distribution or sale of the book \u2014 which could run afoul of First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech. Rather, the government is asking a court to seize the financial proceeds from the sale of \u201dPermanent Record\u201d as well as to enjoin Snowden, who has lived in Russia since 2013, from giving speeches related to the book.\n\nRead: This is what Edward Snowden says it will take for him to return to the U.S.\n\n\u201cIntelligence information should protect our nation, not provide personal profit,\u201d said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cThis lawsuit will ensure that Edward Snowden receives no monetary benefits from breaching the trust placed in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis book contains no government secrets that have not been previously published by respected news organizations,\u201d said Ben Wizner, an attorney for Snowden who runs the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s speech, privacy and technology project. \u201cHad Mr. Snowden believed that the government would review his book in good faith, he would have submitted it for review. But the government continues to insist that facts that are known and discussed throughout the world are still somehow classified.\u201d\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nMost popular at WSJ.com:\n\nU.S. tells Saudi Arabia oil attacks were launched from Iran.\n\nAmazon search change boosts its own products.", "description": "The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday filed a civil lawsuit against Edward Snowden, arguing the former intelligence contractor violated government...", "authors": ["Dustin Volz", "Byron Tau"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD731_snowde_ZG_20190211133058.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
