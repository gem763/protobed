He had been commissioned to design a symbol for the LGBTQ community by his friend Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California.\n\nBaker drew inspiration from the US national flag, which had celebrated its bicentennial in 1976, and an actual rainbow, which displays the colors of the light spectrum in roughly the same sequence as the flag. He assigned a meaning to each of the colors: hot pink for sex, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for magic, blue for harmony and violet for spirit.\n\nThe first flag measured 30 by 60 feet and Baker, who was then 27 years old, had sewn it by hand. \"When it went up and the wind finally took it out of my hands, it blew my mind,\" he told CNN in a 2015 interview . \"I saw immediately how everyone around me owned that flag. I thought: It's better than I ever dreamed.\"\n\nGilbert Baker in 2003. Credit: AFP/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn 2003 a record-setting 8,000 feet long by 16 feet wide rainbow flag flew in Florida.

In the same 2015 CNN interview, he revealed the rationale behind the design of the flag. \"We needed something to express our joy, our beauty, our power. And the rainbow did that,\" he said.\n\n\"We're an ancient, wonderful tribe of people. We picked something from nature. We picked something beautiful.\"", "description": "The original rainbow flag, with eight colors instead of today's six, was designed by American artist Gilbert Baker and first flew in San Francisco in 1978.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190606171127-pride-flag-style-animation-1-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-07"}
