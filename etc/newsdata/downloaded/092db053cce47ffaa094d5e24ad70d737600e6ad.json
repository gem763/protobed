'These ideas were too ridiculous, they were dumb or illegal.'\n\nThe segment that was too shocking for The Kyle and Jackie O Show: The KIIS FM radio hosts (pictured) have revealed the 'dumb and illegal' prank they once tried to pull on their staff\n\nPerhaps the most shocking segment involved Jackie testing the loyalty of KIIS FM staff members by calling them up at 1am and asking for their help getting rid of a dead body.\n\nIf they agreed to help, no questions asked, then they would pass the 'loyalty test'.\n\nAnother segment that didn't make the cut involved listeners coming into the studio to see who could fart the loudest using a sound level meter.\n\nApparently, Kyle didn't want to do the segment because it was 'too childish'.\n\nToo extreme? Perhaps the most tasteless segment that didn't make it to air involved Jackie (pictured) testing the loyalty of KIIS FM staff members by calling them up at 1am and asking for their help getting rid of a dead body\n\nAnother axed segment, called 'The Poo-jitive', involved listeners running around Sydney looking for mystery 'poopers' hiding in bathroom stalls across the city.\n\nContestants would have to knock on the right door and ask, 'Are you the poo-jitive?'\n\nKyle revealed they also had the idea of recording an entire episode of The Kyle and Jackie O Show using sign language for deaf listeners.\n\nTone dead? Kyle (pictured) revealed they also had the idea of recording an entire episode of The Kyle and Jackie O Show using sign language for deaf listeners\n\nThe broadcast would have been streamed online for people to watch.\n\nThe plan didn't work out, however, because neither Kyle nor Jackie knows sign language.\n\n'Our entire radio show would be performed in silence. Yeah, we can\u2019t see that working too well...'
