While the Trump campaign has put its digital operation firmly at the center of the president\u2019s re-election effort, Democrats are struggling to internalize the lessons of the 2016 race and adapt to a political landscape shaped by social media.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s first campaign took far better advantage of Facebook and other platforms that reward narrowly targeted \u2014 and, arguably, nastier \u2014 messages. And while the president is now embattled on multiple fronts and disfavored by a majority of Americans in most polls, he has one big advantage: His 2020 campaign, flush with cash, is poised to dominate online again, according to experts on both ends of the political spectrum, independent researchers and tech executives. The difference between the parties\u2019 digital efforts, they said, runs far deeper than the distinction between an incumbent\u2019s general-election operation and challengers\u2019 primary campaigns.\n\nThe Trump team has spent the past three years building out its web operation. As a sign of its priorities, the 2016 digital director, Brad Parscale, is now leading the entire campaign. He is at the helm of what experts described as a sophisticated digital marketing effort, one that befits a relentlessly self-promoting candidate who honed his image, and broadcast it into national consciousness, on reality television.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Elections Trump-Campaign-Ads-Democrats.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
