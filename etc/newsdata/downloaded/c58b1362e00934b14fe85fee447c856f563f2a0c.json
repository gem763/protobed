Yet approximately 228,000 employees, more than half of all federal civil servants, still have pay problems to this day.\n\nSome people have taken to social media to say Phoenix is one of their top election issues, asking why party leaders aren't talking about it.\n\n21 days until the election and not once has any federal leader mention PHOENIX, nor have any of you reported on it??? \u2014@CBurnsy79 Straw poll. Will <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Phoenix?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Phoenix</a> and other pay admin. failures impact your vote this election? \u2014@CAPE_Local_506\n\nAnother Twitter user compared Phoenix to Ottawa's problem-plagued $2.1-billion light rail line.\n\nWow. Another day of 0-train LOL<br>Every day door issues bring the line to a stop. Its great to know that testing it with 5 people is great. But need to adjust when moving 50000 people!! <br>Was this train system build by the same group that made the PHOENIX PAY SYSTEM!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/phoenixtrain?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#phoenixtrain</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/efWCPjnUBE\">pic.twitter.com/efWCPjnUBE</a> \u2014@JoeR2d2\n\nThe Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), which represents about 140,000 of those public servants, has said in recent months it wants to play an active role in this election campaign.\n\n\"We always talk about Phoenix. We raise the issue in all the spheres of communication that exist in Canada, but you will understand that we are not being listened to,\" PSAC vice-president Magali Picard said in a French-language interview.\n\nMagali Picard, national executive vice-president of PSAC, said she's disappointed that the Phoenix pay system isn't being discussed more in the election campaign. (CBC)\n\n'Really discouraging'\n\nRuby Couture has been working at Place du Portage in Gatineau for almost 10 years, and considers joining the public service a real accomplishment.\n\nBut when Phoenix was launched, she encountered problems immediately. At the beginning, Couture received incomplete pay. Then the government gave her too much money.\n\nFour years later, she owes her employer $30,000.\n\nCouture said it's hard to believe political parties aren't discussing Phoenix more, especially since calculations have shown it will cost close to $3 billion to stabilize the system before replacing it.\n\n\"It's really, really discouraging, and I have lost confidence in my employer,\" she said in French.\n\n\"I do not want to go to work in the private sector, but at the same time, I want to because I am really losing confidence.\"\n\nFederal government workers across the country have dealt with Phoenix pay problems since early 2016. (Public Service Alliance of Canada, BC Region)\n\nBefore the election, Justin Trudeau's Liberal government announced its intention to close the book on Phoenix and introduce a brand new payroll and human resources system for the public service.\n\nThis summer, the federal government made a deal with 15 public service unions that would allow 146,000 public servants to be compensated for problems caused by Phoenix. That agreement does not include the PSAC, which alone has about 140,000 members across the country.\n\nThe government also hired 300 additional compensation advisors to increase the capacity of the pay centre. As of April 2018, some 1,500 employees were working on pay issues.\n\nSahir Khan, executive vice-president of the University of Ottawa's Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy, says he believes political parties won't want to discuss a hot issue like the Phoenix pay system. (CBC)\n\nParty promises\n\nThe Liberal party mentions Phoenix once in its platform, vowing to entirely eliminate \"the backlog of outstanding pay issues for public servants\" so that those employees \"can focus on their work and not on resolving long-standing payroll problems.\"\n\nOn Oct. 8, Ottawa NDP candidates promised they would not only replace the pay system but also hire even more compensation advisers and provide fair compensation for affected employees.\n\nThere was no mention of Phoenix in the Green Party of Canada's platform. The Conservative Party's platform released on Friday made no mention of Phoenix.\n\nTalking about Phoenix doesn't provide federal parties with any real benefit, said Sahir Khan, executive vice-president of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa.\n\nIf you're a voter, how do you exercise your anger on the issue? - Sahir Khan\n\n\"For the Conservatives and the Liberals, they have ownership over it. And for the NDP, the Bloc and the Greens, without a solution to it ... I don't know how you go after it,\" he said.\n\nWhen that reticence is coupled with the perception Phoenix is a local issue, the pay system becomes the elephant in the room no party wants to acknowledge, said Khan.\n\nThat means those who feel burned by Phoenix have no obvious party to reward or punish at the ballot box.\n\n\"If you're a voter, how do you exercise your anger on the issue? Where would you put your vote?\" Khan said. \"I don't think that's clear.\"", "description": "Around 228,000 government employees \u2014 more than half of the federal public service \u2014 continue to have problems with the Phoenix pay system.
