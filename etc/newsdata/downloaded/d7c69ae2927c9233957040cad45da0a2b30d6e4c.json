A clothing shop was set on fire and a bank vandalised.\n\nOne pro-independence protester was badly beaten by a group of rightwing supporters while once again the streets were acrid with the smell of bonfires of burning rubbish. Numerous injuries were reported.\n\nAs the unrest continued, Catalan TV and the main Barcelona TV channel ceased broadcasting news, as did at least one of the online dailies, in support of Friday\u2019s general strike.\n\nNinety-seven people have been arrested across Catalonia since the protests began, and dozens injured.\n\nThe supreme court\u2019s decision to jail the nine leaders for secession and misuse of public funds over their roles in the failed push for independence has provoked uproar among many Catalans.\n\nSpain\u2019s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, has said no criminal activity would go unpunished, adding that Catalonia had experienced widespread \u201cmaterial and reputational damage\u201d caused by \u201cminority groups who are perfectly organised\u201d.\n\nCatalonia\u2019s pro-independence regional president, Quim Torra, has been criticised for being slow to condemn the violence \u2013 and for calling for civil disobedience while sending in Catalan riot police to restore order.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Torra said the violence had to stop, but blamed it on \u201cinfiltrators\u201d who wanted to sully the good name of the pro-independence movement.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow such groups who infiltrate and provoke to harm the image of a movement which counts millions of Catalans,\u201d he said.\n\nTorra has described the supreme court\u2019s decision to jail the nine leaders as \u201cignominious\u201d and suggested that another unilateral referendum on Catalan independence should be held.\n\n\u201cIf we have been sentenced to 100 years in prison for putting out the ballot boxes, the response is clear: we\u2019ll have to put them out again for self-determination,\u201d he told the regional parliament on Thursday.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Spain seeks to extradite Carles Puigdemont as Catalonia braces for general strike", "authors": ["Sam Jones", "Carles Puigdemont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67e40702de30b955f45312b2b3b142a8f0ea908/0_52_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=08b5d24fedd299915753fea89aecc7bc", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
