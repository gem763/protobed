The formats are ready by the date the winner is announced.\n\nA Booker spokeswoman said: \"People with sight loss have a limited choice of books in accessible formats and often have to wait much longer than their sighted peers for titles to be made available to them - and there are many more books that they will never have the chance to read. The Foundation is working with RNIB to change this story.\"", "description": "Publishers say VAT charged on e-books and audiobooks unfairly pushes up prices for the partially sighted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14739/production/_108596738_bookstack1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
