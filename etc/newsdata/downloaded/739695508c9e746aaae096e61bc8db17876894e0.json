Here is this week\u2019s question.\n\n\n\nQ. Do all property taxes in the U.S. go to supporting the local public school system?\n\n\n\nA. Revenue from property taxes pays for a lot more than schools in many places. These funds support the local community and county, and can be used to pay for everything from safety and sanitation to parks and transportation.\n\n\n\nTake New Jersey, which had the country\u2019s highest effective tax rate in 2018, according to ATTOM Data Solutions, a California-based data company.\n\nMore: Will Bitcoin Be Accepted for Property Tax Payments in Toronto?\n\nProperty taxes in the Garden State pay for schools, but also government administration, public safety and law enforcement, emergency services, road maintenance and myriad other services, according to Marc Pfeiffer, senior policy fellow and assistant director at the Bloustein Local Government Research Center at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\u201cProperty tax in New Jersey is strictly local. It does not affect the state government,\u201d he said. \u201cDecisions on how to spend it are made by local decision makers.\u201d\n\n\n\nA New Jersey homeowner pays property tax to their school district, the county government and local municipality, Mr. Pfeiffer said. Some areas may have additional levies to fund green spaces, libraries and fire departments, he added.\n\nFrom Penta: Future Returns: Investing in the \u2018Food Revolution\u2019\n\nTexas, which had the third-highest effective tax rate in the U.S., according to ATTOM, has a similar structure. For example, in Austin, homeowners also pay city, county and school taxes, said Jim Popp, a partner of the Austin-based law firm Popp Hutcheson.\n\n\n\nThere, \u201clocal property taxes help to pay for public schools, city streets, county roads, police departments, fire protection and many other vital programs,\u201d according to the Travis County Central Appraisal District\u2019s website. Hospitals, emergency services, utilities and water-control districts are among the agencies supported by the county.\n\n\n\nEmail your questions to editors@mansionglobal.com.
