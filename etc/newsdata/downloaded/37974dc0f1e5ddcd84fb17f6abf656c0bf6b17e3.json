A casual trip to Nike\u2019s website or app reinforce that message \u2014 the footwear, apparel and accessories style convey a sense of fashion and technical leadership that had gone missing at Nike two years ago.\n\nNo more is Nike playing second fiddle to Adidas. Sorry Kanye.\n\nMeanwhile, others point to Nike\u2019s significant size giving it the leadership position in negotiating very fair costs with suppliers, even as those costs for suppliers rise due to tariffs. Also aiding Nike\u2019s financial cause pros say: growing success with selling wares on its app at full price instead of the always on sale racks at department stores and factory outlets.\n\nNike\u2019s latest earnings \u201cwere simply incredible for a brand in this environment,\u201d said SW Retail Advisors chief and long-time retail analyst Stacey Widlitz on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. \u201cThe product in the last 18 months has done a total 180. We were in an environment that was all about Adidas, particular in Europe, and now Nike is back in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nDriver\u2019s seat indeed.\n\nNike \u2019is a brand of China for China\u2019\n\nNike\u2019s fiscal first quarter sales grew in every single product category, in each geographic region. Surprisingly, the sales gains were paced by Greater China, where sales grew 27% from the prior year. Where Apple iPhones are being shunned for Huawei offerings in a show of nationalism amidst the trade battle, Nike is being embraced.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan (10) wears Nike Kobe Bryant shoes bearing a tribute to slain rapper Nipsey Hussle in the second half of an NBA basketball game Wednesday, April 3, 2019, in Denver.

In China, specifically, we continue to extend NIKE\u2019s lead. In our key cities of Beijing and Shanghai, we serve a generation of digital-first consumers and we support their love of sport by helping to grow participation through grassroots programs. As I\u2019ve said before, NIKE is a brand of China for China and the results continue to prove it out,\u201d highlighted Nike Chairman and CEO Mark Parker on a conference call with analysts.\n\nWhat\u2019s somewhat more shocking is that Nike\u2019s gross profit margins in the quarter gained 150 basis points from the prior year in spite of U.S. tariffs on China and rising costs in places like Vietnam and Indonesia as other industries uproot supply chains to these traditional retail production havens.\n\nDigital sales surged 42%. Nike reiterated its fiscal year 2020 sales growth guidance as well.\n\n\u201cThe athletic footwear cycle and brand power are solid,\u201d said Jefferies retail analyst Randal Konik. \u201cNike\u2019s business is strengthening in NA, and we expect the company to continue to recapture the share it has lost to Adidas.\u201d\n\nNike\u2019s stock is now trading at a record high. And it deserves to be.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
