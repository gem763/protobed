Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington. She ruled that the House Judiciary Committee is entitled to view secret grand jury evidence gathered by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nTypically, Congress has no right to view such evidence. But in 1974, the courts permitted lawmakers to see such materials as they weighed whether to impeach President Richard M. Nixon. The House is now immersed in the same process focused on Mr. Trump, Judge Howell ruled, and that easily outweighs any need to keep the information secret from lawmakers.\n\n\n\nAnd in a rebuke to the Trump administration, she wrote that the White House strategy to stonewall the House had actually strengthened lawmakers\u2019 case. She cited Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to fight \u201call\u201d congressional subpoenas and an extraordinary directive by his White House Counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, that executive branch officials should not provide testimony or documents to impeachment investigators.\n\n\u201cThe White House\u2019s stated policy of noncooperation with the impeachment inquiry weighs heavily in favor of disclosure,\u201d Judge Howell wrote. \"Congress\u2019s need to access grand jury material relevant to potential impeachable conduct by a president is heightened when the executive branch willfully obstructs channels for accessing other relevant evidence.\u201d\n\nThe administration is likely to appeal the ruling; the Justice Department was reviewing it, a spokeswoman said. It came on a day when House investigators unleashed another round of subpoenas. They demanded that the acting head of the White House budget office and two other administration officials testify next month in their inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit him politically.\n\nSlideshow by photo services\n\nDemocrats praised Judge Howell\u2019s decision. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, applauded the \u201cthoughtful ruling\u201d and its recognition that \u201cour impeachment inquiry fully comports with the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis grand jury information that the administration has tried to block the House from seeing will be critical to our work,\u201d Mr. Nadler said in a statement.\n\nIn arguing that the impeachment inquiry is a sham, Republicans have noted that the full House has not voted for a resolution to authorize one, as it did in 1974 and 1998 at the start of impeachment proceedings targeting Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nDemocrats have countered that no resolution is required under the Constitution or House rules and pointed out that impeachment efforts to remove other officials, like judges, started without such a vote.\n\nJudge Howell agreed with the Democrats, calling the Republican arguments \u201ccherry-picked and incomplete\u201d and lacking support from the Constitution, House rules or court precedents.\n\n\u201cEven in cases of presidential impeachment, a House resolution has never, in fact, been required to begin an impeachment inquiry,\u201d wrote Judge Howell, an appointee of President Barack Obama.\n\nThough the impeachment inquiry has broadened to focus on investigating the Ukraine scandal that erupted last month, the dispute before Judge Howell arose from an earlier stage: the aftermath of the Mueller investigation.\n\nAfter Mr. Mueller completed his report about the Russia investigation and Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts as president to obstruct it, Attorney General William P. Barr turned over most of the report to Congress. But he censored portions that contained material that is secret under grand-jury rules.\n\nLawmakers demanded to see that text, as well as underlying documents and transcripts of testimony by witnesses who appeared before a grand jury. In July, they filed a petition asking Judge Howell to order the Justice Department to provide that information under the Watergate precedent.\n\nIn its legal filings, the House Judiciary Committee asserted that it was already conducting an inquiry into whether Mr. Trump should be impeached. At the time, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was seen as reluctant to put forward a resolution formally authorizing such an inquiry, to avoid jeopardizing newly elected Democrats who won seats in moderate districts in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\u00a9 Doug Mills/The New York Times Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, at the White House.\n\nBut in September, as revelations about Mr. Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings fueled support for an impeachment inquiry, Ms. Pelosi announced that one was underway \u2014 but stopped short of bringing a resolution to the floor. Republicans in Congress have seized upon the lack of a formal vote as the foundation for their opposition to the inquiry, focusing on process instead of the substance of the allegations against Mr. Trump.\n\nAs of Friday, all but three Senate Republicans \u2014 Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine \u2014 had signed onto a resolution that accuses Democrats of conducting an unfair inquiry and calls on the House to vote for a formal impeachment investigation.\n\nAlso on Friday, the Republican National Committee\u2019s governing body made the unusual gesture of declaring in a symbolic resolution that it \u201cnow more than ever wholeheartedly supports\u201d Mr. Trump in the midst of \u201ca nakedly partisan impeachment investigation.\u201d\n\nBoth the Trump legal team and Republicans have adopted the lack of a formal impeachment vote as a basis for their arguments that the inquiry is illegitimate \u2014 stressing it both publicly and in letters warning executive branch officials not to cooperate when Congress asks them to testify or provide documents, including Mr. Cipollone\u2019s documents.\n\nSome administration officials have defied that warning and testified anyway, while others have invoked the White House\u2019s directions to refuse to cooperate with impeachment investigators.\n\nOne of the officials subpoenaed on Friday for testimony, Russell T. Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, had cited Mr. Cipollone\u2019s letter when he announced this week that he and another top Trump appointee there, Michael Duffey, would not appear before Congress. Mr. Cipollone denounced the inquiry as \u201cconstitutionally illegitimate.\u201d\n\nMr. Duffey was one of the other officials who received a subpoena on Friday to submit to depositions about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine was part of a quid-pro-quo effort. The third was T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a counselor at the State Department.\n\nThe new subpoenas \u2014 issued jointly by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform committees, which are leading the investigation \u2014 suggested that Democrats intend to continue the private phase of their investigation for several more weeks before convening public hearings.\n\nThe subpoenas will also further challenge the administration\u2019s reluctance to cooperate with the inquiry. Mr. Brechbuhl is a close ally of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and it is unclear whether he follow the White House directive or defy it to join other State Department officials who testified before impeachment investigators.\n\n\u201cWe will not be participating in a sham process designed to re-litigate the last election,\u201d Mr. Vought, one of the other officials who received a subpoena on Friday, said on Fox News this month.\n\nThe budget office, under Mr. Vought\u2019s leadership, has also refused to provide communications and other records to the three panels that could potentially reveal more about the handling of the aid package for Ukraine.\n\nThe committees were also scheduled to hear in closed session on Saturday from Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of European and Eurasian affairs at the State Department.\n\nNicholas Fandos and Edward Wong contributed reporting.", "description": "A federal judge handed a victory to House Democrats on Friday when she ruled that they are legally engaged in an impeachment inquiry, a decision that undercut President Trump\u2019s arguments that the investigation is a sham.
