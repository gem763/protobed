The municipality, which owes Rand Water R100m, had agreed to pay back R87m but it failed to do so.\n\nRand Water plans to cut the municipality's water supply to only 20%.\n\nIn a letter to the municipalities, which News24 has seen, Rand Water indicated that it was disappointed about their lack of cooperation.\n\nThe company\u2019s spokesperson, Justice Mohale, was approached for comment but he could not respond immediately.\n\nNeither Benzi Soko from the Govan Mbeki municipality nor Sentebalent Masimola from the Victor Khanye municipality responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe DA\u2019s Bosman Grobler said the first thing that newly appointed Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Mandla Msibi should tackle was to stabilise the delivery of basic services in the municipalities, particularly those who were unable to manage the debt they owed to Rand Water and Eskom.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Two municipalities in Mpumalanga that breached their contracts to pay bills owing to Rand Water will have their water cut down to a trickle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2874/2f8b6677f21b47bf92bedbb77ff0e353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-31"}
