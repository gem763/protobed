Schiff (D-Calif.) is interviewed at the Capitol on Thursday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nIt was a low point for House Democrats hoping to build a case to remove President Trump from office \u2014 a committee hearing in which former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski made his questioners look hapless with a flurry of deflections and delays.\n\n\u201cI heard it did not go well,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told one of her fellow leaders, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), hours after he had participated in the Sept. 17 hearing \u2014 an observation she and other leaders would hear from several Democrats, according to officials familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Another top Democrat, Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (Ky.), had a more blunt assessment: \u201cA fiasco.\u201d\n\nThe confrontation served as a reminder of how the Democrats, through years of speeches, lawsuits and subpoenas \u2014 even after taking the House majority this year \u2014 have thus far failed to figure out how to hold a norm-busting president and his lieutenants in check.\n\nIt also laid the groundwork for a critical shift in the Democrats\u2019 strategy that has emerged in recent days in the wake of the revelation about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president and Trump\u2019s alleged abuse of power in asking a foreign government to provide dirt on a political rival.\n\nThe confluence of two otherwise coincidental events \u2014 the embarrassing Lewandowski hearing followed in quick succession by the explosion of the Ukraine story \u2014 handed Pelosi an opening to sideline Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) in favor of the more widely trusted head of the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), as Democrats launch the formal impeachment inquiry. And Pelosi has made clear that the investigation will focus narrowly on the Ukraine matter, a scandal she says can be easily understood by the public.\n\nSchiff, in concert with other chairmen, moved swiftly Friday to issue subpoenas for documents from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and set up depositions next week with State Department officials who would have knowledge of Trump\u2019s engagements with Ukraine. One official, Kurt Volker, suddenly resigned Friday as Trump\u2019s special envoy on Ukraine, the first casualty of the burgeoning scandal.\n\nThe panel also scheduled a closed briefing for Friday with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, whose preliminary investigation of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s call found it a matter of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to flesh out all of the facts for the American people,\u201d Schiff said in a letter to colleagues last week. \u201cThe seriousness of the matter and the danger to our country demands nothing less.\u201d\n\n\n\nSchiff speaks as acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testifies on Capitol Hill on Thursday. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nPelosi repeatedly has expressed sadness about embarking on the consequential step of impeaching a president, a politically divisive move that could boost Trump\u2019s reelection bid and imperil her majority. Even if the House votes to impeach Trump, ousting the president is a long shot in the Republican-controlled Senate. Democrats owe House control to dozens of moderates who won in Republican districts last fall and, like Pelosi, dropped their resistance to an impeachment inquiry in the days after the Ukraine revelation. Of the 235 Democrats in the House, 224 back an impeachment inquiry \u2014 86 rushing to support it over a five-day period, according to a Washington Post analysis.\n\n[Where House Democrats stand on impeaching Trump]\n\n\u201cWe must be somber, we must be prayerful, and we must pursue the facts further to make a decision as to, did this violate the Constitution of the United States, which I believe it did,\u201d Pelosi said Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.\n\nFacing a skeptical public, House Democrats are overwhelmingly backing Schiff \u2014 none more so than endangered incumbents who privately pushed Pelosi to at least temporarily muzzle the House Judiciary Committee, which traditionally takes the lead in impeachment. Those lawmakers, mostly moderates in GOP-leaning districts, argued that the panel, which is packed with some of the caucus\u2019s most liberal members, had bungled its investigations and appeared too partisan and eager to oust Trump to carry their message to the broader public.\n\n\u201cI have an issue with people bringing a bucket of chicken into a hearing room,\u201d said centrist Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), who has not backed impeachment and has been frustrated with the Judiciary theatrics. He was referring to Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), who used fried chicken to mock Attorney General William P. Barr for his refusal to testify at a hearing in May.\n\nIn a private meeting Thursday night, several moderates told Pelosi that Schiff needed to be the face of their impeachment inquiry and said they didn\u2019t want other, more liberal voices to continue making the case on television.\n\n\n\nSchiff emerges from a meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nRep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.), who represents an Orlando-area district, had pressed House leaders to appoint a special committee to probe the Ukraine allegations. Soto called the Judiciary hearing with Lewandowski \u201crudderless.\u201d\n\nAfter watching Schiff and colleagues question acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire on Thursday, Soto said he was satisfied with the selection of the Intelligence panel.\n\n\u201cThis investigation has found the proper home to be conducted seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nMost Democrats, including many Judiciary members, see the Intelligence panel as the more appropriate venue for investigating Trump\u2019s July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he asked the foreign leader to help dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cWe need to be aware of the gravity of this moment,\u201d said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), a centrist who worked in the Clinton White House during the last impeachment proceedings and saw firsthand the political blowback against the GOP.\n\nNadler has accepted the change in leadership, according to lawmakers and aides. In a show of unity, the two men appeared side by side at a Congressional Progressive Caucus meeting Thursday, promising a swift and thorough investigation. Through a spokesman, Nadler declined to comment.\n\nWith a seemingly endless string of TV appearances, Schiff earned his Democratic colleagues\u2019 trust as a public messenger early in the Trump administration, leading the party\u2019s response to allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nSchiff, 59, was a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles from 1987 to 1993, served in the California Senate and defeated a Republican who had pushed for President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment to secure a House seat in 2000.\n\nAs former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference unfolded, Republicans leveled withering attacks on Schiff for pushing a collusion narrative that Mueller\u2019s report, they said, ultimately did not support. But inside the secretive confines of the Intelligence Committee, he has won universal praise from Democrats for his tone and professionalism.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no better guy on the face of the planet to undertake this in an adultlike, intelligent, integrity-filled manner than Adam B. Schiff. Period, full stop,\u201d said Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.), a committee member.\n\n\n\nSchiff is interviewed for PBS NewsHour on Capitol Hill on Thursday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nBut perils abound, as Schiff learned Thursday during the Maguire hearing. While many Democrats praised the solemn nature of the proceedings, his decision to dramatize and embellish the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president drew criticism from potentially persuadable Republicans on his panel, not to mention Trump loyalists.\n\nSchiff defended his words as a \u201cparody,\u201d but Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Trump-friendly House Freedom Caucus, introduced a motion to condemn and censure him Friday, shortly after Trump tweeted that Schiff \u201ctotally made up my conversation\u201d and demanded his resignation.\n\n[Acting intelligence chief Maguire defends his handling of whistleblower complaint in testimony before Congress]\n\nThe greater concern, however, was rebukes from Intelligence Committee Reps. Michael R. Turner (Ohio) and Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) \u2014 moderate Republicans who some Democrats say could eventually endorse investigative findings condemning Trump. \u201cWe should focus on the facts,\u201d Stefanik said, calling Schiff\u2019s words \u201cdisturbing and outrageous.\u201d\n\nSo far, the GOP has remained unified behind Trump, but that support has shown some cracks. In the Senate last week, Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said it was inappropriate for Trump to ask Ukraine to investigate a political adversary. And moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) declined to comment on the controversy because she might someday be a juror in a trial to remove Trump from office.\n\nIn Texas on Saturday, Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was asked whether impeachment would galvanize Republican voters. She held up copies of the whistleblower complaint and the memo of the president\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cThese are his words, for God\u2019s sake, and you\u2019ve got Republicans who are silent,\u201d Bustos said at the Texas Tribune Festival.\n\nSchiff\u2019s preeminent role means Nadler and the Judiciary Committee have been at least temporarily relegated to the wings, with their investigative work largely put on hold as Nadler awaits direction on how to write articles of impeachment.\n\nFor months, Nadler was the face of the left\u2019s push to impeach Trump \u2014 much to the chagrin of Pelosi and moderate Democrats who thought he was too aggressive. The Judiciary panel hoped to investigate a list of Trump controversies, from hush payments made to women alleging sexual encounters with Trump to obstructions laid out in Mueller\u2019s report \u2014 charges that many moderate Democrats worried wouldn\u2019t resonate with the public.\n\nAt the same time, the tensions between Pelosi and Nadler were starting to spill out into the open. The two had never seen eye-to-eye on the pace or the substance of an impeachment inquiry, with Nadler pushing a reluctant Pelosi privately to embrace Trump\u2019s ousting, while the speaker maintained that the panel didn\u2019t yet have the goods to sway the public.\n\nRep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.), the Judiciary vice chair, credited Nadler for making the best of a difficult situation \u201cgiven the unprecedented executive branch noncompliance with the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAnd, Judiciary members were quick to point out, they will get to add the final flourish of impeachment. Lawmakers and aides said there is a growing desire, for instance, to include an article condemning Trump\u2019s obstruction of Congress to the bill of offenses to be prepared by the panel.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s time to score the touchdown,\u201d said Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), a Judiciary panel member, \u201cthey\u2019ll give us the ball.\u201d\n\nKaroun Demirjian and Paul Kane in Washington and Dave Weigel in Austin contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Several moderate Democrats facing tough reelection bids privately told the speaker that the Intelligence Committee chairman needed to be the face of the investigation.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xJCc1UjPh7GJBZrvEqQZBN0kjYc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BV3B3VHBLYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
