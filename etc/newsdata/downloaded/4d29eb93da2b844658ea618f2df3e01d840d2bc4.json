His 30-month road ban remains.\n\nJudge Everett said he believed Saunders had 'had a lot to drink' when stopped by police and 'prevaricated' over taking a breath test before his solicitor arrived so the reading would be lower.\n\nHis 'unsatisfactory behaviour' continued, the judge said, and he had taken the 'entirely wrong approach' at the magistrates' court in telling probation officers that he could not do work in the community because of his job as a TV pundit travelling the country watching football matches.\n\nJudge Everett said the district judge had been right to jail Saunders but, because of his previous good character and the prospect of rehabilitation, meant he could suspend the jail sentence for 18 months.\n\nIn footage released by the Crown Prosecution Service, which shows the time as 00.50am in the morning, an officer can be heard saying: 'Come and get out of the car. You driving is atrocious, have you had any alcohol?'\n\nAfter returning the police station, Saunders refused to provide a breath sample, asking for his solicitor. 'Am I doing the right thing or am I getting myself in more trouble by not doing it?' he asked an officer on reception\n\nSaunders spent just one day in custody and was given bail after his lawyers launched an appeal against his jail sentence. He is pictured arriving for his appeal hearing at Chester Crown Court this morning\n\nPassing sentence, he added: 'The sheer shame is going to live with you for the rest of your life.\n\n'You should literally hang your head in shame by what you did. You have had your chance, I suggest you take it.\n\n'I suggest you take the opportunity to tell others that it really isn't worth it. Drink-driving is a terrible thing. Don't.'\n\nFootage was earlier released by the Crown Prosecution Service showing his drink-driving arrest - which the judge referred to in today's decision.\n\nHe said: 'The amount you drank undoubtedly affected your judgement and you decided to drive home. It's really important to stress the seriousness of that offence - the motor vehicle is a potentially lethal weapon.\n\n'We had the opportunity of seeing your behaviour in the police station, there was an element of slurring in your speech, and swaying in front of the police officers - you clearly yawned at one stage.\n\n'If you drink and drive your put yourself behind that potentially lethal weapon.'\n\nThe talkSPORT radio football pundit had pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing. But he later admitted a charge of failing to comply with a roadside breath test and failing to provide a breath sample for analysis\n\nSaunders was capped 75 times at senior level for Wales between 1986 and 2001, scoring 22 times. He also played for Liverpool (pictured in 1992 with Dalian Atkinson and Ray Houghton), Aston Villa and Derby County\n\nThe judge told the court that he often sees the devastating impact of fatal drink and drive offences and told Mr Saunders that had this been a fatal incident he would have gone to prison for years.\n\nHe told Saunders he had seen him hang his head in shame when the CCTV footage of his behaviour was shown in court and added that he hoped he would use his 200 hours of unpaid community work to explain what he did and the consequences of his actions.\n\nHe said: 'It's going to live with you for the rest of your life and follow you around. Any breaches of your sentence will come back to me, and I will send you to prison.\n\n'Don't even think about getting behind the wheel of a motor vehicle.\n\n'You will do those 200 hours promptly and cheerfully, if you don't you will come back to me and you will not have a second chance.'\n\nAlistair Webster QC, representing Saunders, said this was a 'paradigm case' for suspending a prison sentence and the defendant had been unable to watch the footage of his arrest.\n\nThe barrister said: 'It feels, when one looks at the man and his life, past this one evening, disproportionate and unnecessary.\n\nThe father-of-three (pictured arriving at Chester Crown Court when he was jailed in August) had been pulled over in his Audi A8 for his 'atrocious' driving - speeding, swerving over the white line and causing other vehicles to brake - in the early hours of May 10 in Chester city centre\n\n'He has had the experience of going into prison.\n\n'As he was walking into prison, people were shouting threats from the windows.\n\n'He found conditions extremely unpleasant, in terms of a dirty mattress, but the prison staff were good to him.\n\n'Happily he was granted bail but it has been a very salutary lesson.\n\n'He feels he's let everyone down badly and wants to offer a public apology.'\n\nMr Webster said Saunders is 'not a man who plays the law' and it was a 'serious misjudgment' not to provide a specimen rather than an attempt to flout the law.\n\nHe said Saunders had been capped 75 times by Wales - a record number of times - scored 22 goals for his country, was at one time the record-holder for the highest transfer fee paid for a British player, and was an 'icon' in the game.\n\nHe added: 'He's really become a laughing stock and feels it acutely.\n\n'He's not been able to watch (the footage) before because he feels overwhelming humiliation by everything that happened.'\n\nReferences for Saunders, speaking of the charity work he does, were supplied, including letters from his former manager at Liverpool, Graeme Souness, and Richard Bevan, chairman of the League Managers Association (LMA).\n\nThe reference from Mr Souness stated that Saunders was 'not in any way a drinker or a gambler, he was thoroughly dedicated', said Mr Webster.\n\nAnd the LMA is to use Saunders in a project so that 'lessons can be learned' from his experience, the court was told.\n\nIn a statement released by the League Managers Association, Saunders said: 'I want to apologise to the court, my family and all of the people I have let down as a result of my actions.\n\n'I made a terrible error of judgment for which I have been rightly punished, and I wholeheartedly regret that it happened. I accept that I have been given an opportunity by the court and I hope that people can learn from my experience. The message is a simple one - don't ever drink and drive.\n\n'I will learn from this and become a better person.\n\n'I would like to thank everyone who has given me support and guidance throughout this time.'\n\nThe footballer, pictured here with his family, was branded 'arrogant' by a judge at an earlier hearing\n\nSaunders was capped 75 times at senior level for Wales between 1986 and 2001, scoring 22 times. He also played for Liverpool, Aston Villa and Derby County\n\nIn the footage of his drink-driving arrest, which shows the time as 00.50am in the morning, an officer can be heard saying to Saunders: 'Come and get out of the car. You driving is atrocious, have you had any alcohol?'\n\n'I've only had one pint,' Saunders replies.\n\nTwo officers walk him over to sit in the back seat of their vehicle, with one saying 'You can't even stand up'.\n\nAfter returning the police station, Saunders refused to provide a breath sample, asking for his solicitor.\n\n'Am I doing the right thing or am I getting myself in more trouble by not doing it?' he asked another officer on reception.\n\n'You've got the opportunity right now in the room to provide [a sample]... and if not, then you will be prosecuted for failing to provide,' they reply.\n\n'If I don't do it right now... am I going to get in more s***?'\n\nA female officer can only respond: 'You will be charged with an offence.'\n\nThe 55-year-old had looked crestfallen when he realised he was going to jail, and was branded 'arrogant' by District Judge Nicholas Sanders.\n\nThe judge told Saunders he had shown no remorse and considered himself 'above the law'.\n\nBut he was granted bail until his appeal against the jail sentence today - where he was successful.\n\nAt an earlier hearing, Saunders said he had been out at Chester Races and had drunk three pints over the day before getting in his Audi A8 and deciding to drive.\n\nHe was seen shortly before 1am by a police patrol weaving across the road, swerving to avoid other vehicles and almost causing an accident.\n\nOfficers who arrested him said there was a smell of 'intoxicants' and Saunders was slurring his speech and had to steady himself against his car when he was asked to get out of the vehicle.\n\nHe refused three times to give a roadside breath test and was arrested. He again failed to provide a specimen at the police station.\n\nThe 55-year-old said he had been out at the Chester Races and had 'drunk two pints' but claimed his asthma prevented him from giving a breath sample. However he failed to tell officers about his condition when he was arrested.\n\nThe talkSPORT radio football pundit had pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing.\n\nBut he later admitted a charge of failing to comply with a roadside breath test and failing to provide a breath sample for analysis in Boughton, Chester, in the early hours of May 10 this year.\n\nHe was also banned from driving for 30 months and ordered to pay court costs of \u00a3620.\n\nIn an illustrious playing career, Saunders was capped 75 times at senior level for Wales between 1986 and 2001, scoring 22 times.\n\nHe finished his playing career at Bradford City in 2001 before moving into management.\n\nHe had spells in charge of Wrexham and Doncaster Rovers and is a regular pundit on televised matches.", "description": "Saunders was jailed in August after refusing to take a breathalyser when he was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving in his \u00a370,000 Audi A8 in Boughton, Chester, on May 10.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19292800-0-image-a-20_1570184935101.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
