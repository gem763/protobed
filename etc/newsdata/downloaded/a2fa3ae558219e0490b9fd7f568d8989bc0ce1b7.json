It doesn\u2019t, no matter how many progressive women share it triumphantly on social media as a symbol of female empowerment. It\u2019s more a symbol of female entitlement.\n\nIt\u2019s an embarrassment to women who want to be judged on their merits, not given special treatment by men through melodrama and flouncing hysterics.\n\nBut the scene is bad for the president, too.\n\nThe photograph was taken in the Cabinet Room by a White House photographer Wednesday, during a meeting with Democratic lawmakers on a serious topic which has been lost in all the fangirl, \u201cboss move\u201d eulogizing in the media about Pelosi.\n\nThe meeting was supposed to be about national security and Syria. But instead of trying to find a constructive middle ground, Pelosi took the opportunity to stage another petulant outburst and storm out to the waiting media for whom she can do no wrong because she dresses stylishly, adjusts her sunglasses just so, and is a progressive 79-year-old woman who persists.\n\nTrump tweeted out the photo of \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d having an \u201cunhinged meltdown\u201d Wednesday night to illustrate her destructive tactics, and it quickly went viral as she and her supporters facilely appropriated it as evidence that \u201c#PelosiOwns-Trump.\u201d\n\nShe is the first woman speaker of the House, and the most powerful woman in Washington, yet she brings disgrace on our sex.\n\nBecause of the needlessly secretive impeachment proceedings she has instigated, it was incumbent on Pelosi to pour oil on troubled waters and show that her team is capable of working with the president on pressing issues.\n\nInstead, she did what she does best, taunting Trump: \u201cAll roads with you lead to Putin,\u201d she snarked, rising to her feet.\n\nIn her electric blue jacket, the diminutive 79-year-old lecturing the seated 73-year-old president under the watch of a bust of Benjamin Franklin is a striking figure.\n\nCapturing the moment, the image shows the president with an exasperated frown on his face, lips curled, spitting unknown words at her as she points at him. His hands are in his lap, and body language is neutral, as any man\u2019s would have to be lest he be accused of \u201cviolence\u201d or aggressive gesticulation or patriarchal \u201clooming.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s never a level playing field in the #MeToo era and, unfortunately, women like Pelosi, butter never melting in her mouth, take unfair advantage.\n\nSitting next to Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer peers intently over his glasses at Trump like a scientist inspecting the entrails of a rat. Next to him, Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), leaning forward, also is studying Trump\u2019s reaction to Pelosi\u2019s harangue.\n\nThey\u2019re working on cracking the president and the pressure is unrelenting, day after day. That\u2019s their only plan to win the 2020 election.\n\nTrump says he thrives on the pressure but, honestly, no one can withstand such a barrage indefinitely. It\u2019s forcing him to make errors that slowly but surely are alienating those around him.\n\nOn Trump\u2019s side of the table, the other seven men visible look either mortified or resigned. They are like naughty boys held back in a classroom as the bossy mean girl lectures them.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is gripping the table\u2019s edge with both thumbs, eyes downcast.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise, who literally was almost murdered by the Resistance, has his head bowed at 45 degrees, eyes fixed on his firmly clasped hands.\n\nTo President Trump\u2019s right is Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, a bear of a man, resplendent in uniform, a look of utter chagrin on his face. There is no mistaking the emotion.\n\nAnd this is where Trump does the people who serve his administration a disservice.\n\nThe image was taken only minutes into the meeting, during which various Democrats present say the president insulted former Defense Secretary Gen. James Mattis as \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general \u2026 He wasn\u2019t tough enough.\u201d\n\nMattis, who quit last year, honorably had never criticized the president, other than to say he disagreed with the decision to pull out of Syria.\n\nBut the following night, at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York, Mattis felt provoked enough to hit back: \u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield \u2026 Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,\u201d he said, referring to bone spurs Trump used to avoid the Vietnam War.\n\nIt was an understandable get-square, but it did not reflect well on either man.\n\nThis is the problem. Trump\u2019s paranoid street-fighter instinct might be effective in the short term, but it ends up sullying the people he needs to help defend his presidency. He can\u2019t win the next election alone and he\u2019s running out of people to burn.\n\nYes, Pelosi is a disgrace, as are her gormless sidekicks Schumer and Adam Schiff.\n\nBut there is a classy way of rising above their taunts to underline their disrespect and enhance his office that the president never seems to grasp.\n\nGift of Gabbard vs. Hillary\n\nTulsi Gabbard defended herself masterfully against Hillary Clinton\u2019s smear that she is a Russian \u201casset.\u201d\n\nShe branded Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the least of it. Clinton has never been held to account for her venal, tragic incompetence as secretary of state.\n\nWho could forget her lack of empathy when Libyan President Moammar Khadafy was murdered live on camera in 2011 after an American drone attacked his convoy. Dragged out of a truck, half dead, he was sodomized with a knife by rebels yelling \u201cAllahu Akbar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe came, we saw, he died,\u201d Clinton cackled after watching the horror.\n\nIt was the Obama administration\u2019s worst foreign policy fiasco, turning Libya into a failed state overrun by ISIS and helping set in motion the Syrian catastrophe.\n\nWikiLeaks emails showed Clinton had relied on flawed foreign policy advice from her friend, dirty-tricks operative Sidney Blumenthal. In one leaked email, he tells her overthrowing Khadafy will expedite regime change in Syria.\n\n\u201cThe best way to help Israel deal with Iran\u2019s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad \u2026 The resulting regime in Syria will see the US as a friend, not an enemy.\u201d\n\nSure. If anyone has been an asset to America\u2019s enemies, it\u2019s Clinton.\n\nNBA\u2019s Silver tops China gold\n\nCredit to NBA boss Adam Silver for defying China\u2019s demand he fire Daryl Morey after the Houston Rockets executive expressed support for Hong Kong\u2019s democracy protests. China is vowing \u201cretribution\u201d but Silver has found his backbone.
