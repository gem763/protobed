Falk went 47 of 73 for 416 yards with no touchdowns and three interceptions in three games with a 62.4 quarterback rating.\n\nThe Jets (0-4) have struggled in Darnold\u2019s absence, ranking last in the NFL in total offense.\n\nDavid Fales will serve as Darnold\u2019s backup this week. The Jets also have Mike White on the practice squad.\n\nFalk made his Jets debut in Week 2, when he entered the game against Cleveland for an injured Trevor Siemian - who suffered a season-ending ankle injury. Falk then started the next two games - losses at New England and Philadelphia.\n\nCopeland was suspended the first four games of the season for violating the NFL\u2019s policy on performance enhancers. He has denied knowingly using a banned substance and said this week he will sue the supplement company for selling a product that was \u201ccontaminated\u201d with an ingredient that wasn\u2019t listed on the label. Copeland should boost the Jets\u2019 pass rush after a career-high five sacks last season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Jets have waived quarterback Luke Falk to make room on the roster for newly reinstated linebacker Brandon Copeland.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/jets_eagles_football_64445_c0-92-2199-1374_s1200x700.jpg?04775e69c8e588d22a614c7449d900a1eb1b6699", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
