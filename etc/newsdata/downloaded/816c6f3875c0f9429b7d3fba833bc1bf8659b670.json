Net investment income rose to 2.3 billion pounds from 0.2 billion a year earlier, helped by strong equity returns.\n\nGross written premiums rose 1.7% to 19.7 billion pounds but the company's combined ratio, a measure of underwriting performance in which a level below 100% indicates a profit, weakened to 98.8% from 95.5%.\n\nThe results compare with a profit of 0.6 billion pounds a year ago.\n\nPremium rates rose by an average of 3.9%, Lloyd's said. Lloyd's in May asked the Banking Standards Board to conduct a survey of the insurance market's 45,000 participants on issues such as honesty and respect to help to improve its working environment, following allegations of sexual harassment at member firms.", "description": "Lloyd's of London reported a pre-tax profit of 2.3 billion pounds ($2.87 billion) in the first half of 2019.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101037581-179559041r.jpg?v=1532564630"}
