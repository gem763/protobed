The musicians? John Coltrane, playing with pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones.\n\nThe only known soundtrack to be recorded by the legendary saxophonist, Blue World features eight versions of Coltrane's compositions recorded specifically for Groulx's film. And while Le chat dans le sac has been influential in Quebec cinema for the last half-century \u2014 due to Groulx's filmmaking techniques as well as his politically-charged subject matter, exploring the province's Quiet Revolution through the lens of a young couple's personal conflict \u2014 Coltrane's contribution has gone mostly unnoticed.\n\nAccording to NPR, because Coltrane's recording date for this project had \"gone unnoted in session recording logs, this music has occupied a blind spot for Trane-ologists, archivists and historians.\"\n\nBlue World has been technically available for the last 55 years via a viewing of Le chat dans le sac, which is hosted on the National Film Board's site, but this fall marks the first time it will be widely available on its own thanks to a partnership between the film board and Impulse! Records.\n\nListen to the soundtrack's title track below, and get the full soundtrack as of Sept. 27.", "description": "The legendary saxophonist recorded the music for filmmaker Gilles Groulx's Le chat dans le sac 55 years ago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5249791.1565970992!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/3162943.jpg"}
