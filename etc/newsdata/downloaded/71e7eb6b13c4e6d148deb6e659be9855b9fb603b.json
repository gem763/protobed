They believe he could face prison time on charges of extremism, which have sometimes been levelled against Kremlin critics.\n\n\u201cIt was a silent special operation,\u201d fellow traveler Viktor Yegorov said in a video. \u201cThis is how operations to seize terrorists, criminals or other people who pose a danger to the state are done.\u201d\n\nThe interior ministry in Ulan-Ude said in a statement a man born in 1958 had been arrested and would be sent by plane to Yakutia, where he was \u201cwanted for committing a crime\u201d.\n\nNo one with Mr Gabyshev's name and birth year is included on the Yakutia or nationwide wanted lists, however.\n\nViktor Yegorov and Mr Gabyshev rest at a camp near Lake Baikal this week Credit: YouTube More\n\nThe traveller, who said he became a shaman while \u201cliving in the woods\u201d after his wife's death from cancer, in March began a 4,500-mile walk from Yakutia to Moscow, where he claims Mr Putin is a \u201cdemon\u201d ruling in the name of dark forces.\n\n\u201cDemocracy should be without fear,\u201d he said in one interview. \u201cA sorcerer has imposed an illusion of fear and a depression on the whole country, but a sorcerer of light like myself can clear up this apparition.\u201d\n\nHis power-to-the-people message has been quick to win admirers in towns across Siberia, where living standards are low and many still turn to shamans for help with problems. Like a Russian Forest Gump, he has attracted dozens of followers to walk with him part of the way.\n\nA viral video of him at a \u201cRussia without Putin\u201d rally in Chita calling for \u201cpeople's gatherings\u201d to approve laws brought him national attention.\n\nLate last month, a group of shamans from Ulan-Ude tried to stop Mr Gabyshev, arguing that spiritual leaders shouldn't get involved in politics. Police also confiscated two supply vehicles accompanying the Yakut shaman's party.\n\nA gathering of Mr Gabyshev's supporters in Ulan-Ude on September 9 to complain about the seizures turned into a mass protest against the results of elections the day before.\n\nWhile the ruling United Russia party received fewer votes in almost all regions thanks in part to a tactical voting campaign by the liberal opposition, its candidates nonetheless kept control of regional parliaments and posts, including in Ulan-Ude, amid complaints of violations.\n\nAfter three days, the protest was broken up and 17 were detained. Mr Gabyshev did not enter the city.\n\nMr Gabyshev carries a yurt and stove in his pull-cart Credit: VK More", "description": "A popular Siberian shaman walking to Moscow to \u201ccast out\u201d Vladimir Putin and sparking protests along the way has been arrested in an early morning raid on his camp on Lake Baikal.\u00a0 Around 6am, dozens of masked men with batons and assault rifles suddenly seized Alexander Gabyshev, a shaman who has already", "authors": ["Alec Luhn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xVYubIITYMKrW3fG2R0w5g--~B/aD03MjA7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/84c81dd89464fa0dac2c002b29ea75f2", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
