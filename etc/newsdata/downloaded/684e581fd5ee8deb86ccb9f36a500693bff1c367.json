It went viral, garnering 20,000 shares and 32,000 reactions.\n\nRead more\n\nHow to get the best Black Friday deals this year", "description": "A budget airline passenger stuffed her belongings down the front of her jumpsuit to form a pregnancy \u201cbump\u201d in a bid to avoid paying the excess baggage fee.Travel writer Rebecca Andrews almost pulled off the innovative stunt while flying from Melbourne to Sydney with Jetstar, before being found out at", "authors": ["Helen Coffey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G95g0PyAfyV5WN5AQc9TBg--~B/aD0zNTA7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/5329daee5f18e1680b25e8bd93b57e3b", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
