There\u2019s a conspicuous lack of paint spatters, but Qureshi has been working in the newly built studio for only a month. On her painting desk are hundreds of fine brushes and a tiffin carrier full of the seashells she uses as watercolour palettes.\n\nWhen she chose to major in traditional miniature Mughal painting, her art school professor in Lahore told her it was career suicide, but Qureshi doesn\u2019t seem the type to be swayed by popular opinion or to take the easy path; the very reason she trained in miniature painting was the painstaking precision required to master it.\n\nOn the edge of darkness II (2016), acrylic, gouache, gold leaf and ink on illustration board. Nusra Latif Qureshi\n\nUsing both her traditional training and a contemporary visual language, she mixes motifs from the past \u2013 a textile pattern or historical photograph perhaps \u2013 with ideas from the present. According to AGNSW\u2019s head curator of Australian art, Wayne Tunnicliffe, it\u2019s that combination that sets her work apart.\n\n\u201cShe quotes from quite traditional imagery but recontextualises it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that sense of history which gives her work a real richness \u2026 She looks at culture and thinks about how it\u2019s still shaped by the past.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m honing my anger \u2026 trying to make it into a sharp point. \u2014 Nusra Latif Qureshi\n\nOne of the works acquired by the gallery, Descriptions from the past II \u2013 a miniature self-portrait painted in traditional Mughal style \u2013 recalls the cultural dislocation Qureshi felt in 2001. In it, the female figure is placed between two golden orbs, symbolising her two worlds. It\u2019s rare to find women represented in historical Mughal paintings, but Qureshi\u2019s figures are almost always female. \u201cIt\u2019s to assert my dissent,\u201d she says. If men are in her works, they are \u201ctokens of this or that \u2013 usually a negative presence\u201d.\n\nDescriptions from the past II (2001), gouache and gold leaf on wash. Nusra Latif Qureshi\n\nForever and ever I, another of the gallery\u2019s acquisitions, is about \u201cbeing absolutely tired of being used as a woman\u201d. The work features a female outline and five female arms wrapped in threads emerging out of a vibrant red orb. \u201cThis whole series is about this person wanting her own space,\u201d she says, \u201cwanting to be acknowledged just as herself, not [for] baking a cake or raising a child who can speak three languages.\u201d\n\nThe recurring feminist theme is no accident. \u201cI\u2019m honing my anger \u2026 trying to make it into a sharp point,\u201d she says. The catalysts for her rage are \u201ctoo numerous to mention \u2013 from big historical injustices to \u2018why do I have to pick up the kids today?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Qureshi, the fourth of six children, the defining moment of her childhood came when she was five, when her father, a government engineer, died of a heart attack. Her grief-stricken mother, a teacher, had to work harder and never talked about the family\u2019s loss. Left to deal with it alone, Qureshi sought solace in art. \u201cIt can give you relief,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can find a language that expresses that trauma without spelling everything out.\u201d\n\nQureshi in her Melbourne studio. Eamon Gallagher\n\nShe doesn\u2019t remember her father, but the pain lingers \u2013 and seems to surface in her art. \u201cA lot of my work is about things not being there any more,\u201d she says. \u201cEmotional deprivation, emotional poverty.\u201d\n\nIf that makes the viewer uncomfortable, then her job is done; Qureshi aims to create intense works that make the viewer question themselves and the world. \u201cBut I\u2019m sensible not to make it ugly,\u201d she says. Using brilliant colours and appealing aesthetics, she draws the viewer in by stealth before packing an emotional punch.\n\n\u201cIt has to give you an experience of beauty, of pleasant pain, of something you can think about months later,\u201d she says. \u201cBeauty is an interesting trapping device.\u201d\n\nAlso destined for AGNSW: Distant plains of gold (2019) and Knotting the waves (2019). Nusra Latif Qureshi\n\nThe gallery and the jeweller\n\nThe Bulgari Art Award was established in 2012 in partnership with the Art Gallery of NSW to support mid-career Australian contemporary artists. Previous winners are Michael Zavros (2012); Jon Cattapan (2013); Daniel Boyd (2014); Ildiko Kovacs (2015); Jude Rae (2016); and Tomislav Nikolic (2017).\n\n\u201cIt is a very natural collaboration as historically Bulgari\u2019s support for the arts and contemporary design has been an integral part of the brand\u2019s DNA,\u201d says Australia managing director Brad Harvey.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled with this year\u2019s choice. Adding Nusra Latif Qureshi\u2019s work to the amazing alumni of celebrated Bulgari Art Award winners shows the diversity, depth and extraordinary creativity of contemporary art in Australia.\u201d", "description": "For Nusra Latif Qureshi, painting is an outlet for her rage over all manner of injustices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3118%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_312%2C$y_279/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a37f35ec0ea69d5573fc0d24fa63e835ac352130", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
