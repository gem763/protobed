Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is feeling the heat from her rise in the polls: She parried attacks in last night's debate from across the field on her go-big policy plans \u2014 including a soak-the-rich wealth tax that's been central to her campaign.\n\nWarren took incoming on a number of fronts, including her support for Medicare for all, her call for breaking up tech giants, and her foreign policy credentials. (See the full debate transcript here.) But it was her call for a 2 percent tax on households with assets worth more than $50 million that brought some of the sharpest jabs.\n\nThe proposal \u2014 which would add another 1 percent levy for net worths greater than $1 billion \u2014 has set off alarms among the Democratic donor class. On the debate stage, some of Warren\u2019s competitors took aim at it as practically unworkable or too politically polarizing.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions,\u201d former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.) said.\n\nThe accusation highlights the animating tension in the field between more populist candidates and moderates: Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are pushing for a structural overhaul of the economy while many of the others are focused on more incremental change. (O'Rourke, for his part, said a wealth tax would be part of a solution before going on offense.)\n\nWarren sought to change the tenor of the debate over the wealth tax: \u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax,\u201d Warren said, nodding to the fact that Sanders has introduced a wealth tax of his own. \u201cIt's why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d\n\nThe comment elicited some protest from her fellow contenders. \u201cNo one is supporting billionaires,\u201d former vice president Joe Biden said. And Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) fired back that Warren needed a \u201creality check\u201d because \u201cno one on this stage wants to protect billionaires.\u201d\n\nWarren on the campaign trail has emphasized that her levy would raise an estimated $2.75 trillion from roughly 75,000 families. When she rolled it out, she pitched it as a means of rebalancing the concentration of wealth, which she framed as a threat to our democracy itself. Crowds at her rallies now chant \u201cTwo cents!\u201d to voice their support for it.\n\nBut on the debate stage, Warren said she was \u201creally shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I don't have a beef with billionaires,\u201d said Warren, who describes herself as a \u201ccapitalist to my bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy problem is you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut you built that fortune in America. I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to markets on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for. And all I'm saying is, you make it to the top, the top 0.1 percent, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang, the political newcomer who has elbowed his way into contention by touting his pitch for a universal basic income, criticized Warren\u2019s plan as unworkable. \u201cThe problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from?\u201d\n\nWarren, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg talk during break in the debate. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nWarren and Yang also clashed over their theories of the culprit behind growing income inequality. Yang\u2019s campaign is staked on the idea that automation has displaced millions of American jobs, especially for blue-collar and middle class workers, and will only get worse. Warren laid the blame at free trade deals that benefited multinational corporations at the expense of workers.\n\nBut the candidates didn\u2019t dig into the essence of the divide between Warren and her moderate rivals until the end of the debate. The attacks on the Massachusetts liberal shared a theme that Biden distilled: That Warren's plans are too ambitious to stand a chance of becoming law. \u201cI'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done?\u201d\n\nWarren responded by pointing to her role in establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Agency in the wake of the financial crisis. \u201cAll of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try, because you will never get it passed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law.\u201d\n\nBiden countered he had played a role, too, since he \u201cwent on the floor and got you votes.\u201d\n\nWarren offered him no thanks. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople told me, 'Go for something little; go for something small; go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept.' I said, 'No, let's go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.' And President Obama said, 'I will fight for that,' and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

(Olivier Douliery / AFP)\n\n\u2014 Global economy on track for weakest growth since crisis. WSJ's Josh Zumbrun: \"Global growth is expected to slow to 3% this year, according to new estimates from the International Monetary Fund, down from an estimate of 3.2% in July. As recently as 2017, the global economy was growing at a 3.8% pace. The IMF attributed the sharp slowdown over the past two years primarily to rising trade barriers that have stunted manufacturing and investment around the world...\n\n\"As the year has progressed, trade has slowed more sharply than forecasters had expected earlier in the year... Mounting signs of a slowdown have alarmed global economic policy makers, many of whom are traveling to Washington this week for the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. At the top of their agenda is what can be done about a global-growth slowdown.\"\n\nU.S. forecast is cut, too: \"Forecasts for the U.S. were cut by 0.2 percentage point to 2.4% annual growth in 2019.\"\n\n\u2014 Brexit talks stall. Bloomberg's Ian Wishart and co.: \"British and European Union officials are growing increasingly pessimistic about the chances of securing a Brexit deal in time for this week\u2019s summit amid growing resistance from Boris Johnson\u2019s Northern Irish allies. Johnson is struggling to win the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose votes will be crucial if Johnson is to get his agreement through parliament. The DUP is objecting to concessions Johnson has offered to secure a deal with the EU, among them putting a customs border in the Irish sea...\n\n\"If a deal isn\u2019t sealed and approved by the British Parliament by Saturday, then Britain will once again be pitched into a constitutional crisis that could result in a chaotic no-deal exit. Johnson will be told to seek an extension to EU membership, but he has sworn not to delay Brexit further and a legal battle will probably follow.\"\n\n\u2014 \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bEarnings season is off to a great start: \"The unofficial start to earnings season is off to a bullish beginning with companies like UnitedHealth, Johnson & Johnson and J.P.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 Is China really going to follow through with ag purchases? WSJ's Chao Deng and Lingling Wei: \"Despite a Chinese promise to buy more U.S. farm products, questions remain over how much, the time frame for purchases, and what the U.S. might have to give in return. Beijing is pushing the U.S. to drop plans to impose new 15% tariffs on $156 billion in consumer goods starting Dec. 15 and could use the farm purchases as leverage.\n\n\"Chinese negotiators continue to say purchases must be based on actual demand and at fair-market prices, according to people briefed by the matter. The roughly $50 billion in farm products touted by President Trump is far beyond what China has historically spent and would likely require Beijing to lean heavily on its state-owned firms to accomplish.\"\n\nChina threatens retaliation over Hong Kong bill. Bloomberg's Iain Marlow and co.: \"China threatened unspecified 'strong countermeasures' if the U.S. Congress enacts legislation supporting Hong Kong protesters, in a sign of the deepening strain between the world\u2019s two largest economies as they attempt to seal a trade deal.

(Andrew Harrer / Bloomberg)\n\n\u2014 Nellie Liang: Deregulation threatens to exacerbate financial instability. The former top Fed official warns in a Brookings Institution piece that systemic risks are rising: \"The reason: financial regulations are being relaxed at the same time as the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates to offset risks from heightened trade tensions. This is not a good combination at this point in the business cycle. It greatly increases the risk that the next recession, whenever it occurs, will be severe because it will be amplified by elevated financial imbalances...\n\n\"Given current conditions, regulators should be ensuring the strength of the financial sector to withstand future risks, not weaken it, but that is not what is happening in the U.S. Recent moves to ease regulations suggest financial stability risks are at an inflection point. Incentives to leverage will continue to rise as interest rates remain low amid a global search for yield.
