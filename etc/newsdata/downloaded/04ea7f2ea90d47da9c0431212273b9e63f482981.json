You are perfectly capable of ignoring this tweet if you disagree with it\u2019s purpose. Thank you.\u2019\n\nMs Gilson\u2019s LinkedIn profile states that she worked at the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs a number of high profile London hospitals, for 11 years.\n\nWriting online, the mum-of-one said her take home pay is \u00a32,000 a month, of which she spends \u00a3670 on rent, around \u00a3600 on childcare and \u00a3579 on travel.\n\nShe went on: \u2018My basic outgoings (rent, travel to work and childcare) are equal to my monthly wages.\n\nThe tweet provoked some trolling but also sympathy from other Twitter users (Picture: @Lillred/Twitter)\n\nTwitter user Colin said others were in a similar position (Picture: @Lillred/Twitter)\n\n\u2018There is nothing left for bills and groceries, I have to work extra shifts to pay for these (if they\u2019re available).\u2019\n\nMs Gilson has more than 1,500 followers on Twitter and was trolled for asking for cash to be sent to her on PayPal.\n\nApologising for ranting online, she said: \u2018Everyday I live with the fact that I can\u2019t support my child. I should be able to, I work my ass off and I fail.\u2019\n\nDrug that can slow Alzheimer's disease could soon be available to millions\n\nOne Twitter user replied: \u2018Many of us lower income earners, many of us in healthcare can\u2019t afford to be two grand worse off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It will be the difference between just managing as we are right now and actual being in poverty. Having to decide whether to eat or heat etc.\u2019\n\nMs Gilson responded: \u2018I made this point today and was trolled like crazy for it. I\u2019m a nurse and single mum.\n\n\u2018I already have to work overtime to pay my bills/afford groceries because my wages cover rent/childcare/travel and that\u2019s it. I can\u2019t afford to be worse off!\u2019\n\nThe nurse added that the extra shifts she is reliant on are \u2018sporadic and can be cancelled at any time\u2019.\n\nIn June, Ms Gilson started a GoFundMe page in the hope of taking Beth on holiday after her exams next year.\n\nOn that page she wrote: \u2018At first I was reluctant because I HATE asking for help but I now realise that asking for help when the reason is not about you is okay.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
