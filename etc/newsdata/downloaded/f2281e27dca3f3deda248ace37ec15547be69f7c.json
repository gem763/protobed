Cal is off to its best start since 2015 and is ranked in the top 15 for the first time since 2009. The Golden Bears are looking to avoid any letdown before next week\u2019s showdown at No. 13 Oregon.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nArizona State RB Eno Benjamin vs. Cal LB Evan Weaver. Benjamin is one of the most dynamic backs in the conference after rushing for 1,642 yards last season. He hasn\u2019t been as effective this season with just 292 yards through four games but did rush for two TDs last week against Colorado. Weaver has been the leader of the Cal defense, tying a school record with 22 tackles last week, including a stop at the 1-yard line on the final play to seal a win at Mississippi. Weaver leads the nation with 10 solo tackles and 15.8 total tackles per game.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nArizona State: QB Jayden Daniels. He threw for a career-high 345 yards last week, the third most for a freshman in school history. He was 5 for 8 for 112 yards and a TD on third down. He also threw an interception for his first turnover of the season.\n\nCalifornia: QB Chase Garbers. He is coming off perhaps his best game at Cal. He set career highs with 357 yards passing and four TD passes in last week\u2019s win at Ole Miss. He has 13 passes this season that have gained at least 20 yards and is averaging 14.2 yards per completion.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nCal has won nine of the last 12 in the series. \u2026 The Sun Devils have scored double-digit points in 123 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the FBS and two shy of tying Louisiana Tech\u2019s modern FBS record. \u2026 Arizona State WR Brandon Aiyuk has 44 catches for 720 yards and four TDs in his past nine games. \u2026 The Sun Devils have allowed only five plays of at least 30 yards this season. \u2026 The Bears are one of 12 FBS teams to score on every red zone trip, scoring seven TDs and kicking four FGs in the 11 trips.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arizona State (3-1, 0-1 Pac-12) at No. 15 California (4-0, 1-0), Friday at 10:30 p.m. EDT (ESPN).", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/colorado_arizona_st_football_49290_c0-76-1813-1133_s1770x1032.jpg?8679ce9124545a445fa206da7f0f08a679643245", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
