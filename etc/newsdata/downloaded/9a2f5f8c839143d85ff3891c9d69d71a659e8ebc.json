For a sauce, I drizzle a bit of sesame oil over it.\"\n\nKitade described how the rest of the Japan team had looked on in astonishment as he created his protein-rich snack.\n\n\"I was just feeling a bit peckish after the Samoa game so threw it all in the mix,\" he added.\n\n\"The other players were all asking 'what on earth is that?' - but 70 percent of them are eating it now!\"\n\nKitade was asked what Leitch had meant when he said Japan were learning to use the dark side during their Pool A wins over Russia, Ireland, Samoa and Scotland.\n\n\"Leitch was referring to the darker side of human nature,\" he smiled.\n\n\"We've got to be prepared to tough it out with opponents and get a little nasty from time to time.\"\n\nIf Japan have discovered a mean streak, it is their togetherness and free-flowing rugby, rather than their deployment of the game's dark arts, which has earned the history-makers the biggest plaudits on their way to the last eight.\n\n\"We've achieved our target as one team,\" said replacement scrum-half Kaito Shigeno, warning the Springboks that their 41-7 thrashing of Japan in a World Cup warm-up last month would mean nothing in Tokyo on Sunday.\n\n\"South Africa took us out of our game plan last time. But if we stick to it, we can produce another shock.\"", "description": "For all the talk of samurai spirit, Japan have revealed an unusual recipe for their World Cup success...", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7920/0a868498f2bc44d0a1e3f86a13477a0f.png", "published_at": "2019-05-15"}
