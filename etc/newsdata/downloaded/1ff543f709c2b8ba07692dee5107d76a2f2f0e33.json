The second intelligence official is said to have more direct knowledge of the call, The Times reported.\n\nThe first complaint was released to the public last week and centers around a now infamous July 25 phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During their conversation, Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for corruption. He also asked Zelensky to look into an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that meddled in the 2016 election and that it did so to help Hillary Clinton's campaign. This complaint has now become the center of an impeachment inquiry announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week.\n\nTrump also told Zelensky to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in the matter as well as US Attorney General William Barr. Giuliani is mentioned 31 times in the whistleblower's complaint and is described as a \"central figure\" in Trump's efforts. Barr \"appears to be involved as well,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe White House released a summary of the phone call last week that largely corroborates the main details of the complaint. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, also testified to Congress that the memo is \"in alignment\" with the complaint.\n\nThe official who filed the complaint did not directly witness the conversation but heard about it from multiple US officials with knowledge of the phone call and who raised concerns that the president was using the power of his office to urge a foreign country to manufacture dirt on a political rival ahead of an election.", "description": "The official reportedly has more direct knowledge of a July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth", "Sarah Gray"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d97eadb707bdf1b26791c01?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
