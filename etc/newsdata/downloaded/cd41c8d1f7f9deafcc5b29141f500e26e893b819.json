(See the clip below.)\n\nHost Stephen Colbert showed the Beatles legend a photo of him and bandmate John Lennon collaborating on a song. The image inspired McCartney to revisit a period of time when observers had cast him as the bad guy in the breakup of the band.\n\n\u201cA lot of the talk was that I was the villain and that John and I didn\u2019t really get on well ... and I kind of bought into it,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re called it enough, you start thinking, \u2018Well, maybe I was.\u2019\u201d\n\nMcCartney said the picture reminded him that they were indeed friends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful photo for me because it just reminds me of us working together and how cool it was,\u201d he said.\n\nThe music legend, 77, said he thought of his late pal Lennon a lot.\n\n\u201cI dream about him,\u201d McCartney said. When Colbert asked him to share a specific dream, McCartney jokingly retorted, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve had a relationship like that for so long, such a deep relationship, I love when people revisit you in your dreams,\u201d the icon continued. \u201cI often have band dreams. And they\u2019re crazy, and I\u2019m often with John and just talking about doing something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a lot of dreams about John, and they\u2019re always good,\u201d he added.\n\nSome of the dreams involved his \u201cbass covered in sticky tape,\u201d said McCartney, who was on the show to promote his children\u2019s book, \u201cHey Grandude!\u201d We\u2019ll let him explain below.", "description": "The Beatles legend revisited his relationship with John Lennon on \"The Late Show.\"", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a036924000032007c46a9.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
