It's lost its focus,'' he said.\n\nMr Sexton was a pioneer in the craft beer industry in Australia after first establishing Matilda Bay in Western Australia in 1983, before it was later fully acquired by CUB in 1990 for $23 million.\n\nCUB itself is in the throes of being acquired by Japanese brewing giant Asahi in a $16 billion buyout, provided the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission gives approval to the deal. Both CUB and major rival Lion have both been battling a decline in mainstream beer sales in Australia, and putting more emphasis on the faster-growing craft beer segment.\n\nMr Sexton was also an integral player in the establishment of the Little Creatures craft beer brand, which was subsequently acquired by Lion.\n\nMr Sexton has also been a serious player in the wine industry in Victoria's Yarra Valley, with the Innocent Bystander and Giant Steps labels.\n\nThe new Matilda Bay boutique brewery is being built on a site which is the current location of the Giant Steps winery and restaurant, still owned by Mr Sexton.\n\nThe new Matilda Bay brewery will incorporate a pub at the Healesville site and have a capacity of 6,000 kegs annually first up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Sexton said he would be making a new range range of Matilda Bay products along with traditional offerings including the Redback and Dogbolter which were at the forefront of the original craft beer wave in the 1980s.\n\nHe said there would be a big focus on sustainability, with solar panels providing power and waste to be recycled.\n\nCUB acquired two craft beer brands in late 2017, 4 Pines based in Sydney, and Adelaide's Pirate Life as it expanded further into craft beer.\n\nCUB, which makes Victoria Bitter, Carlton Draught, Great Northern and Pure Blonde, already holds a 48.8 per cent market share in the Australian beer industry.\n\nCUB chief executive Peter Filipovic said Mr Sexton would be central to the entire Matilda Bay project.\n\n\"Phil will oversee everything from brewery construction to brewing and marketing,'' Mr Filipovic said.\n\nHe described Mr Sexton as a ''craft beer visionary'' who revolutionised the Australian beer industry.\n\nConstruction of the boutique brewery is scheduled to be finished by the end of 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Giant Steps winery will shift to a new site.\n\nAsahi in August expanded its own craft beer operations in Australia with the acquisition of Green Beacon Brewing in Queensland.\n\nIt already owns Mountain Goat and Cricketers Arms in craft beer, while the bigger beer brands in its stable include Asahi Super Dry, Peroni and Grolsch.", "description": "Phil Sexton was a pioneer in craft beer with Matilda Bay in 1983 and hopes to give it some modern-day sizzle with a new boutique brewery at Healesville", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3321%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_15%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2cbd7d329470f6f6eb69cfddd457d0ef7b97c154", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
