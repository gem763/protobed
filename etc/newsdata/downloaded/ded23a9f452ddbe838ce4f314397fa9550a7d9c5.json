His body was found in a river days later. An all-white jury in Mississippi acquitted two white men of murder charges.\n\nPatrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, said the new marker was dedicated Saturday.\n\nMembers of Till's family, including two of Till's cousins, attended the ceremony at the site where the teen's body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River.\n\nThis is the fourth historical marker at the site. Previous ones became a target for vandals.\n\nThe first historical marker was placed in 2008. Someone tossed it in the river. The second and third signs were shot at and left riddled with bullet holes.\n\nThe new 500-pound (225-kilogram) steel sign has a glass bulletproof front, Weems said.\n\nWeems said the markers were placed as an attempt to acknowledge the truth of what happened there and hopefully spark \"new conversations.\"\n\n\"For 50 years nobody talked about Emmett Till,\" Weems said.\n\n\"I think we just have to be resilient and know there are folks out there that don't want to know this history or who want to erase the history. We are just going to be resilient in continuing to put them back up and be truthful in making make sure that Emmett didn't die in vain.\"\n\nTwo of Till's cousins, the Rev. Wheeler Parker and Ollie Gordon, attended Saturday's ceremony, Weems said.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
