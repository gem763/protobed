You know they\u2019re tired (they swear they\u2019re not), you most certainly are tired (they sense your weakness), and you don\u2019t want to fight this same battle yet again.\n\nIf your kids are old enough to read on their own, you might let them stay up past their regular bedtime to wind down by reading (I\u2019ve done this with my eight-year-old son to great success). But it\u2019s trickier with littler kids; little-kid energy is harder to drain.\n\nOne parent on Reddit may have come up with the perfect solution. User u/Say_Meow commented on this post about bedtime routines to detail how they\u2019ve incorporated a little wind-down time into their daughter\u2019s bedtime routine:\n\nBedtime was a major battle for us. So we started letting our daughter (4yr) have \u2018quiet play\u2019 in her room. Lights are kept low and she\u2019s allowed to play quietly in her room after her bedtime routine if she\u2019s not tired. She\u2019s not supposed to call us over unless she wants to be tucked in. About half the time now she just puts herself to bed. Now that she\u2019s started school, I think we\u2019ll put a more firm lights out time in place, but so far we haven\u2019t had to enforce it.\n\nIt may seem counter-intuitive. We want them to have more sleep, not less. We want them to go to bed, not continue to play until all hours of the night. But the combination of the low lights, the quiet and the solitude seems to work for lots of kids\u2014other parents began responding, saying they\u2019d had success with a \u201cquiet time\u201d or \u201cwind-down time\u201d with their toddlers and preschool-age kids.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had this policy and my 5-year-old is now awesome at self regulating his sleep,\u201d u/JaneJS writes. \u201cWhen he\u2019s tired, he\u2019ll turn off his lights super early and his first week of kindergarten, he didn\u2019t even get out of bed after bedtime.\u201d\n\nI should note that the original poster in that Reddit thread also implemented a shift to their bedtime/morning routine that may work for some parents. Mornings in their home had become a real struggle. Their 6-year-old son did not want to get up, eat breakfast and go to school. Here\u2019s what u/burnt_soul tried in response:\n\nSo last night I wanted to switch things up. He skipped the shower and just washed his face and hands. But this morning I got up early with my son and had him take his shower. All it took was 5 minutes in there and he came out awake, alert and ready to eat.\n\nSometimes the answer to a bedtime or morning struggle is a simple routine switch-up.", "description": "Sometimes, kids just aren\u2019t interested in going to bed.
