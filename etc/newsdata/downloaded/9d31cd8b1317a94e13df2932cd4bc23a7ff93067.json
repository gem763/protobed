But what about an adult in the midst of a total public breakdown? It happens (and not just on televised press conferences).\n\nThink of those angry customers at restaurants who demand to speak to a manager or that viral video of a woman having a breakdown at an Apple store because she didn\u2019t make an appointment. What should you do if you\u2019re witnessing an adult unleashing a temper tantrum in real-time?\n\nYour first tactic is simple: Just listen and stay calm, despite what you might want to say. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll have a constructive conversation when someone is in the red zone,\u201d psychologist Susan Orenstein told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to say something like, \u2018I can\u2019t really listen to you when you are throwing things. But I would be glad to listen when you calm down.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the time being, you don\u2019t have to validate their thoughts or feelings, particularly if you disagree with either; just assure them that they\u2019re being heard. (Joel, our senior video producer, witnessed a temper tantrum from a family member once over a small misunderstanding. His strategy? Let them be angry, at least for the moment.)\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nOnce the meltdown is over and the anger has subsided, Orenstein recommends getting to the root of the problem by finding out what may have sparked their anger. Avoid attacks, and instead, defer to open-ended questions. Maybe it\u2019s about work or a simple misunderstanding?\n\nObviously, this also depends on your connection. If a total stranger is having a meltdown in front of you, you don\u2019t know what might trigger them and asking questions might only worsen the situation. If it\u2019s a friend, then maybe it\u2019s worth getting to the source of the issue, so you can avoid similar meltdowns in the future.\n\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t work, in a post for Psychology Today, psychoanalyst Roberta Satow recommends assessing the potential danger; if you feel uncomfortable at any point, Satow recommends establishing boundaries. Immediately express why you\u2019re uncomfortable and set your limits with this person. If they neglect to respect your feelings, then your next tactic is to allow them space.\n\nWalk away, let them cool off, and assess whether you\u2019re willing to put up with another tantrum. \u201cConsider an ultimatum \u2014 but only if you mean it,\u201d WSJ writes. And if things don\u2019t change, hell, you should absolutely consider cutting them off altogether; here\u2019s how to do just that.", "description": "When you\u2019re dealing with a five-year-old, sometimes, the best way to deal with their temper tantrum is to ignore them altogether.
