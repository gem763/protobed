It is larger than normal at 26sqm but only enough to fit one car.\n\nThe spot is already the most expensive parking spot ever sold in the country, changing hands at auction in 2015 for $264,000.\n\nTwo spots in a building further down Macleay St have been listed at $220,000. Another parking spot in the Chimes building was listed for about $210,000.\n\nLaing and Simmons-Potts Point director Nuri Shik has sold multiple parking spots for over $200,000 and said the $475,000 listing was not indicative of prices. \u201cThat\u2019s not priced to sell,\u201d he said.\n\nThe parking spot has been up for sale for more than five years.\n\nRay White agent Nick Thompson sold four car spots in Elizabeth Bay earlier this year for about $250,000 each \u2014 all in the same building on Onslow Ave \u2014 and said he was inundated with inquiries when the spots went up for sale.\n\n\u201cMost of the old Art Deco buildings in the area don\u2019t have parking,\u201d he said, adding that parking spots in the area could typically be rented out for about $60 per week.\n\n\u201cSome residents don\u2019t want to rent,\u201d Mr Thompson said. \u201cThey want the security of owning the parking and they know the prices will go up. What\u2019s $250,000 today will be $350,000 in a few years.\u201d", "description": "Sydney\u2019s notoriously short supply of parking has become so dire in some areas that single car spaces have come up for sale at over $300,000, while rents are as high as $400 per week.", "authors": ["Aidan Devine"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/25103041/capi_b5de0c0ce9bb630fc01950caa3ccff8b_0856c786867d99a3861af8a1c4089c60.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
