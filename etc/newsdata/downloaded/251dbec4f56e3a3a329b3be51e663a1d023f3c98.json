It\u2019s a story of utter unbe-frickin\u2019-lievable obliviousness by the media. CNN doesn\u2019t bother putting a fig leaf on anything anymore: A glance at CNN\u2019s homepage on any given day is like looking at an assortment of Democratic Party press releases.\n\nAny news that might be happening that can\u2019t be weaponized against Trump is of little interest. Any news that might make Trump or anyone on the right look bad is eagerly pushed through, ordinary standards of fairness and checking be damned.\n\nThe media think Trump\u2019s sometimes overblown attacks on them are making it more vital than ever. But what\u2019s really happening is that the media is beclowning itself trying to end Trump. One recent survey found 95 percent of Americans saying they were troubled by the current state of the media, and two-thirds think journalistic ethics will get worse during the election season.
