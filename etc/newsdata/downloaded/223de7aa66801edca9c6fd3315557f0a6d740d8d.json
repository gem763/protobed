One doesn\u2019t want to denigrate that \u2013 the shift from having no light to some light is major \u2013 but our ambition is more than that. We want energy access that allows for credible family, community and regional economic development. Frankly, we\u2019d like it to allow for entrepreneurial activity too,\u201d he said.\n\nMoniz said that by relying on renewable energy, particularly solar power alongside batteries, developing nations should be able to attract investment in clean energy and rule out the need for future investments in coal-fired power plants. Adopting such methods could also halt the wood-burning that has led to mass deforestation in some countries, he said.\n\nLights out: the price hikes leaving millions of South Africans in the dark | Kimon de Greef Read more\n\n\u201cSpeaking personally, there is a lot of concern about a new round of investments in coal funded by Chinese development banks. There could be a lock-in of emissions for the future. We would rather see distributed [energy grid] architecture, including renewables, and potentially with a role for gas,\u201d he said.\n\nShah added that economic development and the empowerment of women offered the best chance for a low-emissions future.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a woman in rural Bihar and you\u2019re able to all of a sudden access electricity, get a sewing machine, create an income, provide light for your daughter to study at night, it\u2019s just transformational,\u201d said Shah.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the same thing in India and Myanmar and throughout Africa. This commission embarks upon this task with a huge amount of optimism and a real understanding of how important it is in the lives of so many people around the world.\u201d", "description": "Worldwide commission aims to end energy poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia by driving investment in new technology", "authors": ["Jillian Ambrose"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69311ee42becf4517b000eeb22c8b11abc384d5d/0_345_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3ed39540821a829de4d8c10e18041941", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
