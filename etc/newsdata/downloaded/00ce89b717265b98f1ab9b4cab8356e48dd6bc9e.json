It does not apply to those seeking asylum seekers, refugees or children.\n\nBut it would apply to the spouses and parents of US citizens. That could have an impact on families who are trying to bring their parents to the US.\n\nThe proclamation said immigrants will be barred from entering the country unless they are to be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have enough financial resources to pay for any medical costs.\n\nThe Trump administration is trying to move away from a family-based immigration system and into a merit-based system, and Friday\u2019s proclamation is another effort to limit immigrant access to public programs.\n\n'These people aren't just statistics': behind the year's most personal look at immigration Read more\n\nThe Trump administration earlier this year made sweeping changes to regulations that would deny green cards to immigrants who use some forms of public assistance. The White House also directed officials to recover income-based welfare payments from sponsors, and proposed a rule requiring verification of immigration status for anyone seeking access to public housing benefits.\n\nThe required insurance can be purchased individually or provided by an employer, and it can be short-term coverage or catastrophic.\n\nMedicaid for the poor doesn\u2019t apply and an immigrant will not be able to obtain a visa if using the Affordable Care Act\u2019s subsidies when buying insurance. Those subsidies are paid for by the federal government.\n\n\u201cWhile lawful immigrants qualify for ACA subsidies, they\u2019ll be stuck in a catch-22 because subsidized coverage does not qualify as insurance under the proclamation,\u201d tweeted Larry Leavitt, executive vice president for health policy at Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care policy thinktank.\n\nLarry Levitt (@larry_levitt) Qualifying insurance that immigrants can have includes unsubsidized individual insurance, employer coverage, or short-term insurance (which generally excludes people with pre-existing conditions).\n\nTrump has made cutting legal and illegal immigration a centerpiece of his presidency. The Trump administration said last month that it planned to allow only 18,000 refugees to resettle in the United States in the 2020 fiscal year, the lowest number in the history of the modern refugee program.\n\nThe White House said in a statement that too many non-citizens were taking advantage of the country\u2019s \u201cgenerous public health programs\u201d, and that immigrants contribute to the problem of \u201cuncompensated health care costs\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration thinktank, 57% of US immigrants had private health insurance in 2017, compared with 69% of US-born, and 30% had public health insurance coverage, compared with 36% of US-born.\n\nThe uninsured rate for immigrants dropped from 32%t to 20% from 2013 to 2017, since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, according to Migration Policy Institute.\n\nThere are about 1.1 million people who obtain green cards each year.\n\n\u201cThis new attempt at an immigration ban is as shameless as it is stunning,\u201d tweeted Doug Rand, a former Obama administration official who is the co-founder of Boundless Immigration. \u201cIt will be chaotic to implement and guaranteed to separate US citizens from their legal immigrant spouses and other close relatives.\u201d\n\nReuters and Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "White House says too many non-citizens taking advantage of the country\u2019s \u2018generous public health programs\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e72cc8de5218c1e6258374e3c64ea43ff8b20e90/124_91_5647_3389/master/5647.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3dc84e285337198e63234138a99c4cc9", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
