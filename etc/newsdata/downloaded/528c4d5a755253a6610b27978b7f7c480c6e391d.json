Is It Okay That I Started Dating Again?", "language": "en", "text": "Now, is your decision understandable? Absolutely. Your life has been turned upside down emotionally, logistically, and financially\u2014all while the one person who would normally be there for you (your partner) is unable to help. The caregiving is physically exhausting (especially if you\u2019re also working full-time), the finances stressful, and the grief\u2014of watching your partner\u2019s very essence disappear\u2014harrowing. There are other losses, too\u2014of friendships, social activities, someone to watch Netflix or eat dinner with, someone to be intimate with.\n\nWhat you\u2019re experiencing is a disorienting kind of limbo\u2014your partner is there but not \u201cthere.\u201d She\u2019s alive, but lives in a care facility and may not even know who you are. People who judge you may say to you, \u201cWhat about your wedding vows?\u201d and cite the concept of \u201c\u2019til death do us part.\u201d But the thing about insidious diseases like your ex-wife\u2019s is that they rob you of your partner while she\u2019s still alive.\n\nFew people can handle this alone. Some caregiver-partners find support groups helpful because they can talk to others who are going through a similar ordeal and are more likely to understand their feelings and experiences. Some choose not to date, while others realize that not only do they deeply crave a \u201cpresent\u201d partner, but also that having one provides emotional and practical support, making them much better caregivers to their spouses. Even those who are sick and in care facilities sometimes start relationships of their own too\u2014perhaps they don\u2019t remember that they\u2019re married, or perhaps they\u2019re simply lonely and want companionship and connection\u2014just like their partners at home do.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the couple has stopped loving each other. In fact, you\u2019re very lovingly seeing your ex-wife daily and taking care of her needs. And just as you\u2019re dealing with your losses, your son is dealing with his, and your ex-wife\u2019s family are dealing with theirs\u2014all in their own ways. They may not be able to understand your choices, but all you can do is explain to them that in order to survive this tragic circumstance and also be the best possible partner to your ex-wife, this is the choice you\u2019ve made. And when you do talk to your son\u2014with curiosity and compassion\u2014you\u2019ll also be there to hear from him what it\u2019s like for him to lose his mother in this way, and what his needs are.\n\nPerhaps what you\u2019ll find in these conversations is that they are convinced that they would have made a different decision, but the truth is they can\u2019t really know unless they\u2019ve been there themselves. And even if that were the case, what feels right for one person in this sort of situation doesn\u2019t have to be what feels right for you. You might face some people\u2019s disapproval, but you deserve to care for yourself\u2014in whatever form works best for you\u2014as you care for your ex-wife.", "description": "After five years of being her caregiver, I couldn\u2019t bear the emotional or financial costs alone any longer.", "authors": ["Lori Gottlieb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/moving_on_final_high_res/facebook.jpg?1568003759", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
