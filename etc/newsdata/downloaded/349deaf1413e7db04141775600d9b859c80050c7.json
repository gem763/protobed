Since the first qualification campaign in 1934, when only one Asian team, Palestine, entered the qualification phase, the format and number of qualifiers from Asia has fluctuated.\n\nBack in 1934, after Turkey withdrew from the three-team group, Palestine competed against Egypt in a one-off two-leg tie for direct qualification to the tournament in Italy. They were thrashed 11-2.\n\nHong Kong first entered World Cup qualifiers as an independent national team in 1974 when one place at the tournament was on offer to the 18 teams from Asia and Oceania who came through an initial round of classification matches in two \u201czones\u201d (India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines withdrew before the matches were played). They then competed in a group stage to progress to a semi-final before a final match to decide the region's only qualifier.\n\nThis year, in addition to Qatar, who will qualify automatically as hosts, 46 AFC teams will compete for four direct qualification spots, and one extra place in a two-leg inter-confederation play-off match.\n\nThe 12 lowest-ranked teams have already fought out a two-leg first round knockout tie to determine the final 40 teams for this, the second round group stage. The eight group winners and the four best runners-up will advance to the third round of qualifying.\n\nIn the third round, the 12 teams will be divided into two groups of six to play home and away round-robin matches. The top two teams in each group will qualify for the World Cup, and the third-placed teams will advance to the fourth round.\n\nIn the fourth round, the two third-placed teams from the third round will play home and away over two legs. The winner will advance to the inter-confederation play-offs, where they will play a two-leg match against a team from either the CONCACAF, CONMEBOL or OFC confederation with World Cup qualification on the line.\n\nGroup C matches schedule (venue, local time)", "description": "", "authors": ["Https", "Www.Facebook.Com Southchinamorningpost", "Dennis Wong"], "top_image": "http://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/sport/article/3025681/hong-kong-fifa-world-cup-qualy/img/cover.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
