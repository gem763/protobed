The women-led \u201cGhostbusters\u201d remake in 2016 tried to slip past the ban on films that promote superstitions or cults by changing its translated title \u2014 and may have walked back the LGBT identity of Kate McKinnon\u2019s character, Vanity Fair reported \u2014 but Chinese officials blocked the film\u2019s release anyway. That same year, \u201cZootopia\u201d replaced a moose with a panda just for the film\u2019s Chinese launch. Earlier this year, filmmakers clipped nearly three minutes of footage from the Queen biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d to remove all references to Freddie Mercury\u2019s sexuality.\n\nThe controversy over a since-deleted tweet from Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey has brought criticism of Chinese censorship to the forefront yet again.\n\nAD\n\nNBA under fire from all directions after response to Rockets-China incident\n\nOn Wednesday, \u201cSouth Park\u201d released an episode called \u201cBand in China,\u201d which featured the clueless Randy Marsh, the most prominently featured parent in the show, detained in a Chinese prison and labor camp for trying to sell the marijuana he grows on his Colorado farm to what he thinks will be a large, untapped market in China. Meanwhile, his son, Stan, battles with a film producer over the script for a biopic about his death metal band as Chinese advisers request rewrite after rewrite to appease the government\u2019s strict content standards.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor this movie to really make money, we need to clear the Chinese censors,\u201d the producer tells Stan. \u201cYou gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna\u201d do business in China, he adds, punctuating the joke with an obscene metaphor.\n\nIn a scene at the beginning of the episode, several NBA players, including one wearing a Houston Rockets jersey, and recognizable Disney characters \u2014 from Elsa of \u201cFrozen\u201d to Thor of \u201cThe Avengers\u201d \u2014 fly to China as brand ambassadors to entice Chinese viewers to tune in to their American programming. Randy goes to extreme lengths to satisfy the Chinese officials and regain his freedom, eventually strangling Winnie the Pooh, another victim of the country\u2019s suppression of speech. His son rejects the censors\u2019 demands, boldly proclaiming that he cannot sell his soul to make money in the Chinese film market.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not worth living in a world where China controls my country\u2019s art,\u201d Stan eventually tells the producer as he abandons the biopic.\n\nAD\n\nJust two days after the episode aired, the NBA scrambled to respond after Morey tweeted support for protesters in Hong Kong, where millions of pro-democracy demonstrators have been clashing with police over Chinese interference in the semiautonomous territory.\n\n\u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d he wrote in a now-deleted tweet on Friday. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta rushed to clarify that Morey \u201cdoes NOT speak for\u201d the Rockets. Rockets star James Harden apologized and told reporters, \u201cWe love China,\u201d while standing with teammate Russell Westbrook during a practice in Tokyo on Monday, ESPN reported.\n\nAD\n\nThe NBA issued a statement defending Morey\u2019s right to share his views, but also said it was \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d that those views \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.\u201d\n\nThe league\u2019s response led to swift criticism from U.S. politicians on both sides of the aisle.\n\nAD\n\nFormer Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democratic presidential candidate, suggested the NBA was more concerned with money than protecting its people.\n\n\u201cThe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cWhat an embarrassment.\u201d\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet, though, wasn\u2019t the only sentiment that ran afoul of Chinese censors this weekend.\n\nAD\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter searched Monday for the show on several Internet platforms subject to Chinese censorship standards and could not find large swaths of \u201cSouth Park\u201d content. The outlet could not find the show mentioned on the country\u2019s Twitter-like social networking site Weibo and found discussion threads about the show had been killed on China\u2019s largest discussion platform, Tieba.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, the show was removed from China\u2019s most popular streaming services like Youku and Bilibili.com. When users search for the offending episode using its season and episode code, \u201cs23e02,\u201d the services returned the message: \u201cDue to relevant policies\u2019 laws and regulations, some search results cannot be shown.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSouth Park\u201d creators have issued snarky statements in the past, notably telling the Church of Scientology \u201cyou may have won THIS battle, but the million-year war for Earth has just begun!\u201d after Comedy Central yanked a rerun off the air, reportedly under pressure from actor Tom Cruise.\n\nSome politicians agreed with Stone and Parker that Chinese censorship has had too much sway in the United States.\n\n\u201cAnnoy a communist. Watch South Park,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) wrote on Twitter on Monday afternoon. Cruz, who says he\u2019s a lifelong Rockets fan, has vocally criticized the NBA for its response to Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nAnnoy a communist. Watch South Park.\n\n\n\n(Note to @NBA: this is how it\u2019s done.) https://t.co/WByDpKyBtm \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\nGerry Shih in Beijing contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cIt's not worth living in a world where China controls my country's art,\u201d Stan Marsh, one of the main characters in the animated show, said in the episode.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Fn2UF5x4thD0EuoHsaAuSl3p82c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VRCMMPOTJNCC5HPYK53P4NLHMY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
