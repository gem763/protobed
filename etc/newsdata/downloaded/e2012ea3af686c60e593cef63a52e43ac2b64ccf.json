San Francisco's move to break from PG&E is a public vote of no confidence in the company, which has struggled to prevent its equipment from igniting fires amid a sharp increase in wildfire risk in Northern California. It is is now looking for ways to pay mounting liability costs.\n\nThe removal of San Francisco from PG&E's service territory would likely affect rates and service for those in rural and suburban areas outside of the city.\n\nA fuller story is available on WSJ.com\n\nWSJ City: The news, the key facts and why it matters.
