In some parts, authorities deployed boats to rescue residents.\n\n\"The rains have stopped but there is waterlogging in many areas,\" Bihar's Additional Secretary in the Disaster Relief Department Amod Kumar Sharan said.\n\nIn its bulletin on Monday, India's Meteorological Department said the intensity of rainfall over Bihar was very likely to reduce. Showers in Uttar Pradesh are also expected to abate this week.\n\nWeather department officials said this month that monsoon rains were likely to be above average for the first time in six years.", "description": "Floods kill 113 in north India in late monsoon burst, jail, hospital submerged", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_3_800x533_L_1412601605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
