'I don't know if he even knew football because he only spent five minutes on the pitch in training. Nobody knows this, but it's true. That's difficult. You have to pick players at the weekend but you don't watch training.\n\n'I only stayed for one month while he was there but I spoke to some players and they told me it was very difficult. It's true he won a lot of games, but they didn't enjoy it.'\n\nAllardyce responded to Mirallas's claims by telling The Athletic that training sessions would have been shared between himself and fellow coaches Sammy Lee, Duncan Ferguson and Craig Shakespeare.\n\nMirallas only spent one month at Everton during Allardyce's reign that saw him loaned out to his former club Olympiacos.\n\nMirallas sensationally claimed Sam Allardyce spent hardly any time with players in training\n\nThe Belgium international struggled towards the end of his time at Everton as he saw opportunities dry up following a blistering start to life on Merseyside.\n\nAfter scoring a load of goals for the Toffees during the first part of the 2014-15 season, Mirallas reveals how Tottenham began pursuing him and were looking to make a move in the January transfer window.\n\nAfter speaking to Spurs chairman Daniel Levy and Mauricio Pochettino, Mirallas couldn't resist the chance of playing Champions League football so he 'pushed to leave'.\n\nIn order to tempt Everton into giving up one of their prized assets at the time, Spurs offered cash plus Aaron Lennon \u2013 which was rejected.\n\nWith a move dead in the water, Mirallas was told the move fell through because Lennon was a different type of player to him.\n\nMirallas recalls his awkward meeting with Aaron Lennon after his move to Spurs fell through\n\nHowever, Mirallas recalls an awkward meeting with the Englishman following his loan move from White Hart Lane.\n\n'Finally, on the last day (of the transfer window), they brought in Lennon (on loan)', Mirallas recalls. 'I remember being shocked when I got to the training ground and saw Aaron. I said, \"Aaron, I didn't have a problem with you because you are a good guy, but what the f*** is that?\" I was very shocked.'\n\nMirallas finally brought an end to his time at Everton earlier this summer when he left on a free to join Royal Antwerp.\n\nHe made 186 appearances for Everton, scoring 38 goals and notching 34 assists.", "description": "Former Everton star Kevin Mirallas has opened up on his turbulent time with the Toffees, which included an awkward meeting with Aaron Lennon after a move to Tottenham fell through.", "authors": ["Sam Mcevoy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/11/19782842-0-image-a-14_1571221597190.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
