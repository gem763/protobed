Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIt came right before the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets arrived in China for what proved to be a tense two-game exhibition tour, with broadcasters refusing to air the games, public anger raging, and local sponsors cutting ties with the NBA.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by months of demonstrations by citizens who accuse Beijing of chipping away at its freedoms. China has portrayed the protesters as violent separatists and bristled at what it calls \u201cforeign interference\u201d in the matter.\n\nThe backlash in China against Morey\u2019s comments has cast a cloud over the NBA\u2019s lucrative broadcasting, merchandising and sponsorship interests in the country, where it has legions of fans.\n\n\u201cWe were being asked to fire him by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\u201d Silver said during a panel discussion in New York on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe said there\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nBeijing on Friday issued a flat denial.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government has never raised these kinds of demands,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters.\n\nSilver said the dispute over Morey\u2019s actions had taken a big toll on the league\u2019s bottom line.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where we go from here,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThe financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\n\n\u201cThe losses have already been substantial,\u201d he added. \u201cOur games are not back on the air in China as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\u201d\n\nSilver hit back at criticism of the NBA\u2019s early statements on the crisis, which many saw as overly deferential to authoritarian Beijing.\n\n\u201cWe were saying we regretted upsetting our fans (but) also at the same time supporting Daryl Morey\u2019s right to express himself, right to tweet\u2026 Maybe I was trying too hard to be a diplomat.\n\n\u201cThere was no regret directed to the government (but instead) to our fans, hundreds of millions of them in China.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018American values\u2019 \u2013\n\nBeijing\u2019s response to Morey\u2019s comments sparked US accusations that Beijing was using access to its vast market as leverage to dictate public dialogue in other countries.\n\nBasketball superstar LeBron James, who travelled to China with the Lakers for the exhibition games, this week said Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated\u201d on the situation and suggested the Rockets executive should have kept his mouth shut.\n\nBut Silver said Thursday that the league had a responsibility to defend freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cThe values of the NBA \u2014 the American values, we are an American business \u2014 travel with us wherever we go,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of those values is free expression.\u201d\n\n\u2013 15-year effort \u2013\n\nSince the row began, the NBA has found itself under pressure from US politicians and media outlets who have urged the league not to buckle under Chinese criticism, or even to withdraw from the Chinese market completely.\n\n\u201cI understand there\u2019s a point of view from some that we shouldn\u2019t be in business at all in China and I\u2019d say from an intellectual standpoint that\u2019s fair,\u201d Silver said.\n\n\u201cBut if people believe we shouldn\u2019t be engaged in commerce in China\u2026 I look to the American government.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany multi-national corporations trade extensively with China and if that\u2019s ultimately how our government feels we should be dealing with China, again, we\u2019re a US company.\u201d\n\nBut Silver said he feared the NBA\u2019s 15-year effort to build cultural ties with China and expand the game\u2019s reach there had been undermined by the Morey dispute.\n\n\u201cI felt we had made enormous progress in terms of building cultural exchanges with the Chinese people,\u201d Silver said.\n\n\u201cI have regret that much of that was lost.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 China demanded that a Houston Rockets executive be sacked for supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, NBA commissioner", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/646d10_adam-silver-nba-refused-sack-or-discipline-houston-rockets-executive-daryl-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
