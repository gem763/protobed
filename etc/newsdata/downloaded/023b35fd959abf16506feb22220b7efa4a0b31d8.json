We haven\u2019t performed to the best of our ability in \u201813 and \u201815 but it was always one I wanted to tick off my bucket list to get the urn over here.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s attack toiled long and hard all day after England had begun the day 18-2 chasing an unlikely 383 to win.\n\nA stubborn ninth-wicket stand between Jack Leach and Craig Overton offered England faint hopes of surviving but part-time spinner Marnus Labuschagne removed Leach before Overton was trapped lbw by Josh Hazlewood.\n\n\u201cThe boys were getting a bit tired out there but at the start of the day we thought we would have our eight chances and it proved to be the way. England fought incredibly hard and Overton was exceptional and showed great courage,\u201d Smith said.\n\nHazlewood said there had been some anxious moments as England dug in.\n\n\u201cThe heart was definitely beating fast in that last couple of hours,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we got Jos (Buttler) I think we felt we had the time but it was a hell of a last couple of hours.\u201d\n\nAustralia captain Tim Paine said it had been an emotional triumph, especially after England had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat in the third test at Headingley.\n\n\u201cThe amount of work to retain the Ashes has been enormous and I\u2019m really proud of this group and how we bounced back from Headingley,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere at every ground has been unbelievable. The noise they make here and the passion they have for cricket makes this moment all the more special. We\u2019re thrilled. This is what we came here to do.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a bloody good night tonight together and celebrate but we\u2019ll be back on deck next week. We want to win the Ashes 3-1.\u201d\n\nEngland skipper Joe Root said he was proud of his team despite now not being unable to win back the Ashes.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cAnother great Test match, but it\u2019s bitterly disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom today\u2019s point of view, I am really proud.\n\n\u201cYou learn a lot about your team. Everyone stood up and played bravely. We have seen some wonderful Test cricket and I expect the same at The Oval.\n\n\u201cWe want to level the series. We have to pick ourselves up and turn up at The Oval.\u201d", "description": "Batsman Steve Smith said retaining the Ashes in England was one to tick off his bucket list after Australia beat their tradtional rivals by 185 runs to win the fourth test at Old Trafford on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427676322&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870WM", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
