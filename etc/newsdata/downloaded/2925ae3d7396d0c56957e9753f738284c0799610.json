Maas added: \u201cGermany wants to launch a consultation process with all relevant actors. There is still a lot of work before we can have such a conference. But we have started working on a process.\u201d\n\nLibya drone strike heightens fears of air war and risk of civilian deaths Read more\n\nTwo previous conferences in the last year, one in Palermo and another in Paris, failed to bring about any breakthrough before Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the military commander in the east of Libya, tried to capture the capital, Tripoli, the seat of the UN-recognised government.\n\nSalam\u00e9 has been touting the idea of a conference for more than two months and in an address to the UN security council called for a three-stage process, including local ceasefires, a national conference and then a national meeting inside Libya.\n\nMaas stressed his work was in support of Salam\u00e9, who has been touring European and Middle East capitals in support of his conference plan. Salam\u00e9 told the security council: \u201cIt remains abundantly clear that without the commitment of key external actors engaged in Libya, the conflict will continue.\u201d\n\nUnderlining the scale of the breach of the UN\u2019s authority, he told the UN: \u201cThe violence in Libya is exacerbated by the supply of additional arms, ammunition and war materiel into the country. Violations of the arms embargo have been both routine and often blatant by both of the main parties to the conflict and their respective sponsor member states.\u201d\n\nHe revealed the UN panel of experts was investigating over 40 cases of arms embargo breaches of varying magnitude, despite non-cooperation by most of the perpetrator member states. \u201cIt is sadly true to say that the arms embargo has been ineffective since 4 April 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere have been no interdictions or searches conducted at sea, despite such activities being authorised by UN resolutions The reported recent arrival of thousands of mercenaries into the country risks the further extension and escalation of the conflict.\u201d\n\nHe said the purpose of the conference was to \u201csend a strong message on the need for respect of the arms embargo, to commit to non-interference in Libyan affairs and to address the main causes of conflict as formulated by the Libyans themselves and to emphasise its clear and active support for whatever political formula the Libyans agree to.\u201d\n\nWith the French president, Emmanuel Macron, focused on brokering peace in Iran, the Italians busy bedding down a new coalition government and Britain preoccupied by Brexit, Germany became the natural European hosts for the conference, and is seen as largely neutral in the conflict between Tripoli and Haftar. Macron, the UAE, and Egypt are normally cited as the strongest external backers of Haftar.\n\nThe clashes between the two sides have left more than 1,000 people dead and about 5,500 wounded, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).", "description": "Violations of embargo have been both routine and often blatant, says UN special envoy", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc04b80c572d3ac39f5f12a9f01d298e489d0c5/988_489_3356_2014/master/3356.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9a96c0dcb1de80d89c616098ac6abd21", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
