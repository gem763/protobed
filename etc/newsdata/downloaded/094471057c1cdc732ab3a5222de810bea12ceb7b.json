One of the people had vaped a variety of products, including bootleg THC e-cigarettes products.\n\nThe other person could only confirm vaping nicotine but said the contents of other products they had used were 'unknown.' That person also suffered an underlying health condition, though it's not clear what kind.\n\nEchoing the CDC's own warning, Dr Lynfield warned all Minnesotans against buying any vaping products off the street, precisely because the chemicals used in them are not known.\n\nLast week, the CDC went a step further, recommending that 'people refrain from using e-cigarettes, or vaping, products that contain nicotine.'\n\nIt's also urged that no one should use vaping products that contain THC, which were used by 76 percent of those who developed lung illnesses.\n\nInvestigators continue to search for an explanation of what about and how e-cigarettes are triggering life-threatening lung damage.\n\nRecent analysis of the lung tissue of people with EVALI suggested that toxic chemicals released when e-liquids are heated may be damaging lungs.\n\nOthers have theorized that oils, including the glycerin base used in many vaping products or vitamin E acetate may be triggering inflammation and injury.\n\nIn the meantime, officials say that people using nicotine e-cigarettes as quit aids should not go back to smoking combustible cigarette, but are particularly warning young people and pregnant women against vaping.\n\nIn an effort to stem illnesses and deaths, states including Washington, Rhode Island and New York are implementing bans on flavored e-cigarettes thought to entice youth and teenagers.\n\nMassachusetts has gone a step further and banned the sale of all e-cigarettes.\n\nA judge overturned Michigan's attempt to ban flavored e-cigarettes on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, a Florida woman filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Juul, claiming that her son, Daniel Wakefield, had died at age 18 after using the companies popular products.\n\nA number of other individuals, cities and states have sued the company for deceptive marketing that they claim got teens and youth hooked on Juuling.\n\n\n\n", "description": "With the addition of two confirmed deaths in Minnesota this week, the state's vaping death toll has hit three.
