He repeatedly implored Americans to vote for his former press secretary on \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d mistakenly called his current defense secretary \u201cMark Esperanto,\u201d instead of Esper, and threatened to get involved with a murder trial in Anguilla.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA lynching,\u201d \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d and \u201cscam,\u201d he called the impeachment investigation that began on Sept. 24. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool!\u201d he wrote to the Turkish president in a formal letter that threatened to destroy the nation\u2019s economy with sanctions, weeks before announcing that he was dropping all sanctions. \u201cI want to see the server,\u201d he said in the Oval Office, reviving a conspiracy theory that could exonerate Russia for hacking Democratic emails in 2016. He even accused former vice president Joe Biden of raping and pillaging the nation, though instead of saying \u201crape,\u201d Trump said \u201cthe R-word.\u201d\n\nWithout the luxury of undivided attention, anyone who tried to follow the bouncing ball of Trump\u2019s hourly utterances and tweets was doomed to fail, and there is no relief on the horizon. Simply tracking the provocations, contradictions and exhortations that fill the average day of this president can be an overwhelming task.\n\nBut it has also become an increasingly consequential one as the impeachment case against Trump unfolds and his foreign policy decisions come under greater scrutiny both in the United States and abroad. He ordered a surprise withdrawal of troops from Syria, prompting immediate fighting, loss of life and a shift in the balance of power in the Middle East. He also announced his intent to award his own golf course a major federal contract for an international summit, and then reversed that decision days later amid criticism he was using the power of his office to help his struggling business.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe resulting controversies have only amped up Trump\u2019s response. Over a sample of seven days between Oct. 14 and 20, he sent a blur of 206 tweets and spent hours talking in front of news cameras, always seeking to monopolize attention, for good or ill. The defense of his actions is dependent less on the merit of his words than the sheer number of them. He dazzles and misdirects, prods and pokes, changes topics midsentence, and frequently offers claims that are on their face so bizarre that they demand repetition by the media, if only to be discounted.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in a fight, there are only two ways to win: You can bring your opponent to submission or you can break their will to fight,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, a Trump critic who managed Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cThere is no doubt that the effect of the great Trump fog machine is a type of exhaustion that has disengaged millions of Americans from politics.\u201d\n\nAt a Cabinet meeting Monday, Trump spent the better part of an hour talking, making claims at odds with reality.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe took personal credit for defeating the Islamic State \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m the one that did the capturing\u201d \u2014 despite a summer report from the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general that the insurgent group has \u201csolidified\u201d its capabilities in Iraq and was \u201cresurging\u201d in Syria. Out of nowhere and with no evidence, he accused Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) of being the whistleblower that launched the impeachment inquiry over his actions toward Ukraine. He suggested former president Barack Obama was guilty of corruption for signing a production deal with Netflix 16 months after leaving office.\n\nDemocrats, who lost the 2016 election amid similar attempts by Trump to dominate public attention, have made no secret of their concern over his approach, both for the impeachment investigation and next year\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWe are in such an information-overload world people can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s important, what\u2019s more important than something else, how do you make sense of this,\u201d former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who lost the presidential contest to Trump in 2016, said in a podcast interview last week. \u201cWe have a really difficult environment to do politics in, to govern in, legislate in and certainly conduct an impeachment inquiry in.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor his part, Trump seems quite clear about the effect he hopes to have on the overwhelmed American public. He shared a video three times over the weekend that asked Americans to just turn off the news.\n\n\u201cThis is just noise. Tune it out,\u201d advised a Fox News pundit in the clip. \u201cYou know how you feel.\u201d\n\nOf course, the consequences of Trump\u2019s words and actions reach beyond feelings, or even voter sentiment. And the tendency of Trump and his advisers to reverse themselves \u2014 doubling the number of headlines they can notch \u2014 has made matters only more confusing.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision Oct. 17 to force foreign nations to pay his own resort for the 2020 Group of Seven Summit appeared to contradict the plain language of the U.S. Constitution, until he reversed it two days later under Republican pressure.\n\nAD\n\nThe admission by his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, that Trump held up aid to Ukraine to force an investigation of the country\u2019s role in the 2016 election seemed to confirm the quid pro quo allegation at the heart of the Democratic impeachment inquiry, until Mulvaney reversed himself hours later in a written statement.\n\nAD\n\nThat reversal did not prevent the president from sharing a video the next day featuring a sympathetic columnist who argued that it was perfectly proper for Trump to hold up aid to force an investigation of the 2016 election.\n\nIn Syria, the president\u2019s confusing and controversial statements have carried the gravest consequences. On Oct. 7, he released a statement announcing that U.S. troops would withdraw from the border region with Turkey before a \u201clong-planned\u201d Turkish military operation in the area. He spent the following weeks denying that this amounted to a \u201cgreen light,\u201d even as his decision led to the displacement of at least 100,000 people and led to fighting that has killed dozens of civilians.\n\nAD\n\nHe seemed to encourage international conflict in Syria on Oct. 16 \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with\u201d \u2014 and then announced on Oct. 17 that he had let the Turks and the Kurds \u201cfight like two kids in a lot\u201d and decided to pull them apart by brokering a fragile cease-fire.\n\nAD\n\nThen on Wednesday, he announced the cease-fire would be permanent, a proposition he also called \u201cquestionable\u201d but something \u201cI do believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cA small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area where they have the oil,\u201d he said, though he has offered no plans for extracting or profiting off the resource.\n\nAt one point, he called his plan to withdraw forces from Syria \u201cstrategically brilliant.\u201d Two days later, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wrote that the same decision was \u201ca grave strategic mistake.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe clearest demonstration of Trump\u2019s tendency to overload communication circuits came on Oct. 16, when he met in the Oval Office with the president of Italy. A reporter asked him to react to criticism of his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine.\n\nThe president responded with more than 1,000 words, a monologue that lasted five minutes and 41 seconds, including an interruption for a follow-up question about Giuliani.\n\nAD\n\nTrump answered neither question directly. Instead, the president alleged corruption in the 2016 election without offering specifics or evidence. He promoted an unreleased Justice Department inspector general report on the use of secret warrants to investigate foreign interference in the 2016 election, speculating that it would impugn several former FBI officials.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see whether it\u2019s President Obama,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also criticized former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) for not using subpoenas more, saying the current speaker, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), hands them out \u201clike cookies.\u201d He denounced leaks of impeachment testimony in the House, called the Democrats \u201ca disgrace,\u201d defended his phone call with the Ukrainian president as \u201cperfect,\u201d spoke about how many people listen when he makes diplomatic phone calls, falsely claimed that the whistleblower report on his call was \u201ctotally wrong,\u201d and denied, once again, any quid pro quo.\n\nAD\n\nHe predicted the Democrats would lose control of the House in 2020. Then he demanded that the FBI acquire and let him see the Democratic National Committee email server that the U.S. intelligence community said was hacked by Russia. He said he rebuilt the military, boasted of a $5,000 increase in median household income, and falsely stated that the economy is \u201cthe best it\u2019s ever been.\u201d (The rates of wages and GDP growth have been higher in the past, and the unemployment rate has been lower.)", "description": "Anyone who tried to follow the bouncing ball of Trump\u2019s hourly utterances and tweets was doomed to fail.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/87HUWPKm_qUHnwyj8rqFuqdvGUo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C2JDCZXVYAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
