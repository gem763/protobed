Bernie Sanders of Vermont proudly calls himself a democratic socialist. But fellow Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2013 who holds many similar extreme-leftist positions \u2013 claims she\u2019s really a capitalist.\n\nThat\u2019s a claim that would add a few feet to Pinocchio\u2019s nose.\n\nWarren can call herself anything she wants. She falsely called herself a Native American for years and finally had to apologize for that instance of mislabeling. But if truth in packaging laws applied to politicians, Warren would have to admit she\u2019s no more a capitalist than she is a Native American.\n\nCHARLES PAYNE: ELIZABETH WARREN WANTS TO BREAK APART AN ECONOMY THAT'S WORKING\n\nWith her long record of promoting socialist causes and her calls for massive new job-killing government regulations and huge tax increases \u2013 on income, wealth, and whatever she can think of to take money from hard-working individuals and businesses \u2013 Warren is as much of a socialist as Sanders.\n\nWhile their views aren\u2019t are identical, the true ideological colors of Comrade Bernie and Comrade Elizabeth are both shades of red.\n\nIn the wake of Sanders\u2019 recent heart attack, Warren appears better positioned than ever to become the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nominee.\n\nReal Clear Politics\u2019 average of recent presidential surveys shows Warren is now polling eight percentage points higher than Sanders. And in two national surveys \u2013 one by The Economist and another by Quinnipiac \u2013 Warren is polling higher than the longstanding front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAlthough Biden has been considered a lock to win the nomination by some analysts for months, it seems unlikely he will be able to compete with a far-left challenger like Warren or Sanders once the race inevitably narrows.\n\nAlthough Biden is unquestionably a progressive whose policies would cause substantial damage to the U.S., he\u2019s not a radical who wants to dynamite the capitalist system that has made America the most prosperous and powerful nation on the planet. But that\u2019s exactly what Warren and Sanders want to do.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Biden\u2019s TV debate performances have made the former vice president look more than a little confused. At times, it appears Biden isn\u2019t sure where he is or what year it is \u2013 never mind what the candidates are debating.\n\nWarren is a different story entirely. Her debate performances have been sharp and, at times, impressive \u2013 though she sometimes sounds like a nagging schoolteacher berating her young students.\n\nWhy, exactly, hasn\u2019t Warren been labeled a \u201csocialist\u201d? The biggest \u2013 and perhaps the only \u2013 reason is that she and others in her party and the left-leaning media continue to insist she isn\u2019t one, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary.\n\nFor example, in an Oct. 13 interview with ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Sanders said: \u201cThere are differences between Elizabeth and myself. Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nLike many of the things oozing from Comrade Bernie\u2019s mouth, this, too, is false. Warren is a socialist through and through and her dangerous, destructive policy plans would \u2013 like all socialist proposals \u2013 cause substantial harm to America\u2019s economy and society, hurting everyone, including the most impoverished.\n\nWarren understands that if she says she\u2019s a socialist, she\u2019ll lose support from moderate voters whose support she would need in the general election to defeat President Trump. So she pretends she\u2019s not what she really is.\n\nHere are just some of Warren\u2019s many frightening socialist plans for the United States:\n\nWarren has endorsed the \u201cJust Society\u201d proposal of socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. This radical idea would \u2013 among other things \u2013 redefine poverty in the United States so that potentially tens of millions of additional Americans will be pushed onto social welfare programs like Medicaid. A \u201cJust Society\u201d would also make it illegal to deny illegal immigrants and those who have been convicted of crimes access to welfare programs.\n\nWarren has proposed what she calls The Accountable Capitalism Act. This would force every corporation in America with $1 billion or more in annual revenue to obtain a federal charter from a new regulatory agency. The legislation would require that at least 40 percent of corporate board member be elected by workers, and impose costly new bureaucratic regulations on companies. This would likely cause a mass exodus of the most important businesses from the U.S. \u2013 stunting economic growth, sending unemployment skyrocketing, and increasing the national debt\n\nWarren has also proposed imposing a single-payer health care system. This would outlaw most forms of private health insurance and force the more than 140 million Americans now enrolled in private insurance plans onto government-managed health plans \u2013 all at a cost of $32 trillion over 10 years. Single-payer models elsewhere in the world require very high taxes and have led to rationing of health care and long wait times. This rationing increases unnecessary pain and suffering for millions of people and in the most extreme cases can lead to some patient deaths.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWarren also wants to spend $500 billion over 10 years to build millions of new housing units, and trillions of dollars to cancel college student loan debt for 42 million Americans. She would also \u201cgive every American the opportunity to attend a two-year or four-year public college without paying a dime in tuition or fees.\u201d\n\nWarren, like Sanders, was one of the original cosponsors of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal. This is the most radical, dangerous, environmentally destructive proposal in modern American history. The Green New Deal would destroy millions of jobs by eliminating most forms of fossil fuel generation and use, including that gasoline-powered vehicle you drive to work every day. It would also create a new system of publicly-owned banks, basic income programs, a federal jobs guarantee, massive new green housing mandates, a universal health food program, and countless new \u201csocial justice\u201d programs.\n\nThese proposals \u2013 and the incredibly high tax increases needed to fund them \u2013 would push the U.S. closer than ever to full-blown Marxism, and they are without any doubt in line with socialist principles. This is why self-described socialists like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have embraced or even proposed the vast majority of them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWith Halloween just around the corner, millions of children will be dressing up for one night pretending to be all sorts of characters. Warren has stopped pretending to be a Native American, but pretends every day to be a capitalist \u2013 while she knows very well that she\u2019s a socialist through and through.\n\nFor the sake of our country and the American people, let\u2019s hope voters see through Warren\u2019s masquerade.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JUSTIN HASKINS", "description": "With her long record of promoting socialist causes and her calls for massive new job-killing government regulations and huge tax increases \u2013 on income, wealth, and whatever she can think of to take money from hard-working individuals and businesses \u2013 Elizabeth Warren is as much of a socialist as Bernie Sanders.", "authors": ["Justin Haskins"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/18/694940094001_6095977512001_6095975790001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
