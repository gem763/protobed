The right-hander also earned his first victory over the White Sox in three outings this season.\n\nThe Indians are in a tight race with Oakland and Tampa Bay for the second wild card spot in the AL.\n\nReyes belted his 34th home run - his seventh since being acquired from San Diego - to extend Cleveland\u2019s lead to 6-2 in the fifth. He is batting .400 with five homers and 15 RBIs over his last 12 contests.\n\nThe Indians held an 8-2 advantage in the eighth before Jos\u00e9 Abreu and Tim Anderson each hit two-run homers for Chicago, the latter off closer Brad Hand.\n\nNick Wittgren replaced Hand with the bases loaded and one out in the ninth, retiring Eloy Jim\u00e9nez when Oscar Mercado made a spectacular leaping catch in center field, then struck out Ryan Goins for his fourth save.\n\nMercado had three hits and fellow rookie Yu Chang singled twice and drove in two runs for Cleveland, which has lost four of six. Reyes scored three times and Yasiel Puig went 2-for-5 with an RBI.\n\nChicago starter Iv\u00e1n Nova (9-12) gave up six runs and 11 hits in 4 1/3 innings. The right-hander entered the day with the highest opponent batting average in the majors at .294 and ranks second with 198 hits allowed.\n\nAnderson had three hits and two runs. Daniel Palka went hitless in four at-bats, making him 1-for-53 on the season.\n\nDIFFICULT DECISION\n\nIndians manager Terry Francona admitted having second thoughts about using RHP Carlos Carrasco in the eighth inning Tuesday. He gave up a three-run homer to James McCann and a solo shot to Jim\u00e9nez that gave the White Sox a 6-5 win.\n\nCarrasco, who was diagnosed with a treatable form of leukemia in June, had only made one appearance since being activated two days earlier.\n\n\u201cMaybe I rushed into it a little bit,\u201d Francona said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking about after the game.\u201d\n\nTAKING A LOOK\n\nWhite Sox 2B Danny Mendick was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte after finishing among the International League leaders with 133 hits, 66 walks and 19 stolen bases. \u201cI\u2019m certainly going to give Danny some starts,\u201d manager Rick Renteria said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy he\u2019s here and we\u2019re going to give him an opportunity to enjoy being in the big leagues.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nWhite Sox: OF Jon Jay (right hip strain) was transferred from the 10-day injured list to the 60-day IL, officially ending his season. The 34-year-old batted .267 with zero homers and nine RBIs in 47 games. He will be a free agent in November.\n\nIndians: RHP Corey Kluber (left oblique strain) has \u201cgot a ways to go\u201d in his recovery, according to Francona. The two-time AL Cy Young Award winner was injured in the first inning of a rehab assignment at Triple-A Columbus on Aug. 18.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWhite Sox: RHP Reynaldo L\u00f3pez (8-12, 5.41 ERA) allowed six runs in a career-low 2/3 innings in his last start Aug. 31 at Atlanta. It was the eighth time he has given up at least six runs in 28 appearances this year.\n\nIndians: RHP Zach Plesac (7-5, 3.61 ERA) struck out seven over seven innings and allowed one run in a 2-0 loss at the White Sox on June 2. The rookie is 5-1 with a 3.06 ERA in nine starts at Progressive Field.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Shane Bieber struck out nine over seven innings to snap a three-game losing streak and Franmil Reyes hit a two-run homer as the Cleveland Indians beat the Chicago White Sox 8-6 on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Dulik"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/white_sox_indians_baseball_64251_c147-0-3386-1889_s1770x1032.jpg?b861ee53e7cb2b9d75452567332f8073dde4ae46"}
