If you\u2019re going to be busy this year but still want to get in the holiday spirit, here\u2019s our pick of eight of the most interesting konbini Halloween treats for 2019.\n\n1. Chocolate Cream Daifuku\n\nThe chocolate cream inside has a nice marshmallow-like texture.\n\nThere\u2019s no tricks when it comes to this treat. Something sweet and chocolatey really is the best way to treat yo\u2019 self. This powdery glutinous rice cake is filled with decadent chocolate-flavored cream fluff. That\u2019s right\u2014you won\u2019t find any of that surprise red bean paste in here; it\u2019s honest-to-goodness cacao all the way.\n\nStore: 7-Eleven\n\nPrice: \u00a5127\n\nRanking: 4/5 (This is a classic Japanese sweet filled with chocolatey goodness instead of beans. Hooray!)\n\n2. Sausage and Black Bolognese Burrito\n\nBlack is the new orange? IMO Italy and Mexico should really only meet in sports tournaments that no one watches. Whoever gave birth to this culinary abomination please tell me what possible connection could exist between bolognese, burritos, and Halloween. If you couldn\u2019t tell from the offending Insta pic, this strange burrito has two sausages, cheese and a black tomato-based bolognese meat sauce stuffed into an orange tortilla. But why tho?\n\nStore: 7-Eleven\n\nPrice: \u00a5257\n\nRanking: 1/5 (Nice try 7-Eleven, but that\u2019s a big \u2018ole NOPE from us)\n\n3. Black Cat Sachertorte\n\nLegends say the devil gifted black cats to witches to act as their servants. This adorable sachertorte is made with a moist chocolate sponge and apricot jam, then coated in crispy chocolate styled to look like the feline sidekick. Yes, that\u2019s supposed to be a cat.\n\nEven though it kind of looks more like a drunk rock with two balls of turd plopped on its head\u2026 I give it an A for effort.\n\nStore:7-Eleven\n\nPrice: \u00a5332\n\nRanking: 3/5 (Nice for fans of apricot, cat lovers or drunken rocks)\n\n4. Pumpkin Creme Brulee Rilakkuma Wagashi\n\nDefinitely the cutest item on the list! Get your hands on this adorable Rilakkuma wagashi (Japanese traditional confection) called nerikiri at Lawson. Nerikiri is typically made with an outer layer of white bean paste and mochi mixed together and filled with smooth red bean paste. Again the beans have been replaced with something infinitely better (if only for the fact that it is not anything to do with beans). This Halloween version is stuffed with a pumpkin creme brulee flavored filling and is shaped like the beloved lazy bear when he could finally be bothered to get his act together and put on a pumpkin costume. So meta.\n\nStore: Lawson\n\nPrice: \u00a5280\n\nRanking: 5/5 (This pumpkin Rilakkuma is so cute who wouldn\u2019t want to take him home and bite off his head?)\n\n5. Pumpkin Pie\n\nTopped with a whopping six pumpkin seeds.\n\nNot the well-known Thanksgiving dessert but instead a petrifying pastry! This delicious cream-filled pie from Family Mart is made with Hokkaido pumpkin (fancy!), pumpkin cream, and topped with a frugal amount of pumpkin seeds. It\u2019s like the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice latte of convenience store treats. Also, it\u2019s not really that petrifying, it\u2019s quite homely actually. Put it in the microwave and it\u2019s like eating an actual pie from the oven.\n\nStore: Family Mart\n\nPrice: \u00a5138\n\nRanking: 3/5 (How much do you like pumpkin?)\n\n6. Baked Cheese Tart\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love cheesecake?\n\nIf you\u2019re anti-pumpkin or are simply looking for an excuse to eat cheesecake, this baked tart is for you. Although this really is just a classic baked cheesecake tart packaged in a fun Halloween wrapper, it\u2019s a great option for those who are really not interested in the weird \u201clet\u2019s make everything orange and black\u201d konbini concoctions.\n\nStore: Family Mart\n\nPrice: \u00a5138\n\nRanking: 4/5 (Come on, it\u2019s cheesecake!)\n\n7. Devil\u2019s Chocolate Cake\n\nDevour the devil.\n\nThe ultimate chocolate indulgence. Between the three layers of chocolate pudding is a rich chocolate mousse topped with chocolate cookies. A real devils treat because you\u2019ll want to eat more and more (one isn\u2019t nearly enough) until you\u2019ve been diagnosed with type two diabetes and have had to sell your grandma to pay for the healthcare. It\u2019s dangerously good. At least, for your grandma anyway.\n\nStore: Family Mart\n\nPrice: \u00a5258\n\nRanking: 5/5 (Chocolate heaven\u2026 or in this case, hell.)\n\n8. Pumpkin Danish\n\nLight and fluffy.\n\nAre you tired of pumpkin-flavored sweets? Well too bad because there\u2019s no shortage of them this time of year. This pumpkin danish is filled with smooth pumpkin cream and topped with sesame seeds. It\u2019s super filling and makes for a fun Halloweeny breakfast on the go. Also, look at that pastry work. Bravo, Family Mart. Bravo.\n\nStore: Family Mart\n\nPrice: \u00a5128\n\nRanking: 4/5 (Pumpkin, pumpkin, pumpkin. Goes well with morning coffee and a lack of sunshine.)\n\nTrick or treat, (don\u2019t) smell my feet, give me something good to eat!\n\nPlanning on going all out for Halloween this year?
