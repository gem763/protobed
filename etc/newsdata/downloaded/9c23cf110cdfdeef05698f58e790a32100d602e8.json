It was only running full pelt that saved him then.\n\nThe time another rival smashed a mirror over his head. The time guys from his own gang turned on him with a metal bar during a dispute.\n\nAnd the time during a fight he was passed a knife to protect himself, only to then be battered into the side of a car, crushing his hand and pushing the weapon clean through it.\n\n(Image: Hezron Brown/BPM Media)\n\nThese are the stories he now tells young teens who find themselves, like he was, drawn to gang culture, often due to a sense of not belonging, little hope for their futures, or because their own families have broken down.\n\nAnd it is Hezron\u2019s achievement in turning his own life around, and his dedication to helping others do the same, which has seen him crowned Prince\u2019s Trust Young Achiever at the Mirror\u2019s Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB.\n\n\u201cI show the young people the scars on my face, my hands, and I tell them what happened with each one,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cI see how it opens up their eyes. They have been in those situations, they know it could have gone wrong.\n\n\"I say 'Any of those times I could have lost my life.' I make them concentrate on their lives. I tell them the gang does not love them and there is another life.\u201d\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror/Andy Stenning)\n\nHe adds: \u201cI never thought someone like myself would be put forward for something like this. At one point, I didn\u2019t even know if I would be alive today.\n\n\u201cIt has made me realise anything is possible, but you have to believe in yourself, and you can achieve. That\u2019s what I try and do for the young people. I want to be the person I didn\u2019t have when I was younger, who they can ask for advice. I needed that person, but I felt alone.\u201d\n\nToday, Hezron runs his own business, More Talk More Action, which aims to reach more young people in this position. He is also a Prince\u2019s Trust Young Ambassador after being signposted as a young man to a theatre scheme run by The Prince\u2019s Trust, which enabled him to first find employment.\n\nIt is a life far from his experiences as a child and teenager.\n\nAged five, a terrible accident saw Hezron fall into a bath of boiling water at home and suffer debilitating burns across his body.\n\nBut it was the bullying he suffered when he came out of hospitaland started school which was to have the most damaging effect.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror/Andy Stenning)\n\nHezron\u2019s method for coping with the bullies became to fight back, and soon he developed anger issues which spiralled and affected both his school and home life.\n\nHe was excluded from both primary and secondary schools, and admits his own mum became frightened by his outbursts and their relationship eventually broke down.\n\n\u201cIt was a cycle, I became so angry I wouldn\u2019t know what I was doing. I was violent towards my mum, my whole family. She was scared of me,\u201d he admits.\n\nFrom a young age he sofa-surfed with friends and family, and even found himself sleeping rough as young as 12.\n\nBy 15 he was housed in emergency accommodation, then a B&B and finally given a council flat, but he felt completely alone, frightened, and struggled to cope with the pressures of adult life.\n\nBy 17, kicked out of college after a row with a tutor, he was drawn into the gang.\n\n\u201cIt offered me a family, to me it was a bunch of brothers who would support each other, it made me feel safer\u201d he explains.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\u201cA lot of them were in similar positions to myself. It was just good to be part of something \u2013 I wasn\u2019t doing anything else.\u201d\n\nHezron began selling drugs, and although he didn\u2019t carry a knife for fear of being stopped and searched by the police, he opted instead for a sharp pair of scissors as a \u201cdeterrent\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cA lot of young people I speak today carry a knife,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they do it out of fear. They don\u2019t want to be a victim, they tell me they wouldn\u2019t leave their house without a knife.\u201d\n\nHezron remained with the gang for around two years. In the end, it took just one supportive comment from one empathetic person to help him decide to leave. It was what he had been waiting for.\n\nFinding himself convicted for robbery aged 19, he went to his pre-sentencing report appointment, and the woman writing it greeted him sadly.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nHe recalls: \u201cShe said \u2018Not another black man\u2019. She asked me what had happened and she told me \u2018You don\u2019t deserve to go to prison. She seem like a nice guy, hanging around with the wrong crowd.\u201d She told me things would only get worse if I went to prison.\n\n\u201cShe wrote my report, and I didn\u2019t go to prison. It made me realise that everything I was doing was pointless.\u201d\n\nHezron says he immediately stopped hanging out with the guys in the gang.\n\nDetermined to change completely he went shopping and ditched his black hoodie and balaclava for a white top and new jeans.\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn)\n\nOf course, finding a new way of life wasn\u2019t as easy as that, but with a new determination he sought out education, re-took some exams and learnt new skills.\n\nSignposted to The Prince\u2019s Trust Get Started with Theatre, a week-long programme, he then secured a job at the Birmingham Rep Theatre.\n\n\u201cI found self-respect and self-belief,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI realised I was not a bad person, I was getting caught up in bad things.\u201d", "description": "Hezron Brown, from Birmingham, will be given his Pride of Britain award tonight after turning his life around", "authors": ["Emily Retter", "Image", "Hezron Brown Bpm Media", "Daily Mirror Andy Stenning", "Daily Record", "Philip Coburn"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741349.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PRIDEOFBRITAIN2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
