Mandatory Credit: Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLately, Bosa also has been chasing the pulse of his defensive unit \u2014 or at least working to find what\u2019s ailing it.\n\nThe Chargers enter their Sunday visit to the Chicago Bears struggling on defense, namely in allowing big plays. Although Los Angeles sits in sound positioning in several league defensive rankings \u2014 including passing yards allowed (fifth), points allowed (10th) and total yards allowed (11th) \u2014 the team still has proven susceptible to breakdowns in key moments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s hits and misses,\u201d Bosa said. \u201cI think the pieces are there. We just have to tackle a little better, and I think it\u2019s a totally different ballgame.\u201d\n\nChargers coach Anthony Lynn and defensive coordinator Gus Bradley maintain that improved gang tackling, getting as many defenders to the ball as soon as possible, will boost Los Angeles (2-5) and help provide a difference down the stretch.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 five losses have come by a combined 27 points. Free safety Rayshawn Jenkins, whom Lynn called the \u201ceraser tackler\u201d this week, plays a prominent role as the last line of defense.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s missed a couple (tackles), and I think the ones that he\u2019s missed have been big, so it seems like he\u2019s missed a decent amount of tackles,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cBut he really hasn\u2019t. ... If he misses, a lot of times it\u2019s going to be a big play. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to have a guy back there that can tackle and that\u2019s aggressive, like Rayshawn.\n\n\u201cOverall, Rayshawn is one of my better tacklers in the secondary. We have had some tackling issues, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I don\u2019t think Rayshawn is one of them.\u201d\n\nInjuries have wrecked the Chargers up front, and top receiver Keenan Allen (hamstring) was added to the training room log this week. He was unable to practice Thursday and Friday and his availability at Chicago is in serious doubt.\n\nChicago (3-3) has lost two straight as it searches for an offensive identity. The Bears are averaging 263.7 yards per game, ranked 30th in the NFL, while their average of 70.0 rushing yards per game ranks 28th, one spot and 4.3 yards per game fewer than the Chargers.\n\nComing off their bye week, the Bears had a franchise-low seven carries during their 36-25 home loss to the New Orleans Saints in Week 7. Although the team struggled to establish a rhythm in any facet of its attack with quarterback Mitch Trubisky returning from a shoulder injury sustained in Week 4, Bears coach Matt Nagy has aimed to rejuvenate the ground game going forward.\n\n\u201cI know we need to run the ball more. I\u2019m not an idiot. I realize that,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cSeven rushes and the minimum amount of times, I totally understand that. You need to do it. I never go into a game saying I want to throw the ball 54 times (as Trubisky did against the Saints).\n\n\u201cI would love to go into a game and say I want to run the ball 54 times. But that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nBears defensive back Sherrick McManis, who sustained a concussion against the Saints, didn\u2019t practice Wednesday, but all others on the active roster are healthy.\n\nLynn said Wednesday that left tackle Russell Okung would make his season debut in Chicago after suffering a pulmonary embolism in June. However, Lynn said Trent Scott would take a majority of snaps as Okung works himself back into shape.\n\nChargers defensive end Melvin Ingram returned to a limited practice Wednesday after missing the last three games with a hamstring issue. He\u2019s likely to play for the first time since Week 4.\n\nChicago leads the all-time series 7-5, including victories in the past two meetings between the teams, in 2011 and 2015.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa is accustomed to corralling opposing quarterbacks and ball carriers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444980356&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1PP-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
