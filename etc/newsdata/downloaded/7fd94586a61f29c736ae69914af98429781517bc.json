USA TODAY\n\nShopping at Target is now more rewarding \u2013 for all shoppers.\n\nDays after shopping at Target.com and some locations became more magical because of new Disney stores opening, the retailer expanded its loyalty program, Target Circle, nationwide.\n\nWith the free program, shoppers will earn 1% on every purchase to redeem on a future Target trip. They\u2019ll also get personalized offers like a birthday discount of 5% and can cast votes to help direct Target\u2019s giving to approximately 800 nonprofit organizations.\n\nHowever, shoppers with a Target RedCard aren\u2019t eligible to earn 1% when they pay with the store-branded card but will continue to get 5% off purchases and can take advantage of the other Target Circle perks.\n\nA new magical experience: New Disney stores at Target now open, featuring 'Frozen 2' and Star Wars merchandise\n\nBed Bath & Beyond closings: What you need to know about coupons, returns and gift cards\n\nTarget Circle is now available nationwide. (Photo: TARGET)\n\nTarget's longtime savings tool, Cartwheel, is now built into Circle and still has hundreds of discounts daily.\n\nSara Skirboll, the shopping and trends expert at RetailMeNot, said the program is a great way for Target to compete with Amazon Prime.\n\n\"With no membership fee required, Target shoppers can access these new benefits, like early access to special sales and personalized savings, without any pressure on their wallet,\" Skirboll said.\n\nLike the new Disney stores and the new Good & Gather food line, the loyalty program is another way Target is trying to connect with shoppers.\n\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer worked with actor Will Smith to surprise shoppers using self-checkout with jokes, pranks and free gift cards. Smith posted the YouTube video Oct. 3 and it had more than 2.1 million views Monday.\n\nHow Target Circle works\n\nSigning up: All shoppers nationwide with an existing Target.com, Cartwheel or RedCard credit or debit card were automatically enrolled in Target Circle. Shoppers also can join by making a Target.com account or by giving their phone numbers in a Target store.\n\nNon-RedCard loyalty members earn 1% on every Target run to redeem later. RedCard holders still save 5% off purchases made with their Target credit or debit cards.\n\nEarning rewards: To start accruing earnings and votes, scan the Wallet barcode in the Target app or use your phone number at checkout in stores, or log in to their Target.com account when shopping online.\n\nGiving back: All members earn a vote per transaction and cast votes to direct Target\u2019s community giving initiatives using the Target app or Target.com.\n\nRedeeming rewards: To redeem the 1%, scan the Wallet barcode in the Target app, give your phone number or log into your account when shopping online. Earnings cannot be redeemed on some items including, adult beverage purchases, dairy product purchases, prescriptions, Same Day Delivery purchases and gift cards.\n\nBirthday reward: With a Target Circle account, you\u2019ll get a reward for 5% off a shopping trip on or near your birthday. Learn more at Target.com/Circle.\n\nSaving with Circle offers\n\nThe Target app, available for Apple and Android, has hundreds of Circle offers, formerly known as Cartwheel offers, ranging from 5% to 50% off in categories such as groceries, clothes, furniture, baby products, health, seasonal and more.\n\nDownload the app at Target.com or directly at the Apple or Google Play app stores. Either create a Target.com account or log in with an existing account.\n\nEveryone can add up to 50 offers on their Circle account whether they are a newbie or super saver.\n\nSearch or browse for deals by categories or scan item bar codes with the app. The app also curates personalized offers based on past purchases. Offers can be sorted by newest, highest discount, trending deals or by expiring.\n\nSave offers to your wallet by clicking the plus sign. To delete offers, click on the green check mark.\n\nMany Circle offers can be redeemed on Target Drive Up and in-store pickup purchases. The offers note how the offers can be used.\n\nScanning the main Wallet barcode combines Circle offers, store ad coupons and Target payment options. RedCard shoppers may have additional coupons in the app and those need to be scanned before the Wallet.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/08/how-target-circle-savings-program-works/3900265002/", "description": "Target Circle is now available at all stores nationwide and replaces Cartwheel with additional perks.
