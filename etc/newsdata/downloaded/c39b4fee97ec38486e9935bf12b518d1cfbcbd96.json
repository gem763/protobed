However, it occurs in smaller volumes and does not remain in the atmosphere as long.\n\nA major study by Cornell University released earlier this month suggested the boom in fracking for shale gas and renewed oil extraction in the US has already led to a global spike in methane emissions blamed for accelerating a rise in average temperatures around the world.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

On the eve of this year's World Economic Forum, the renowned naturalist told the audience that the worlds of business and politics should \"get on with the practical solutions\" needed to prevent environmental damage. \"As a species we are expert problem solvers. But we've not yet applied ourselves to this problem with the focus it requires. \"We can create a world with clean air and water, unlimited energy, and fish stocks that will sustain us well into the future. But to do that, we need a plan,\" he said. The broadcaster made his speech after receiving a Crystal Award, which is awarded by the forum to \"exceptional cultural leaders\". AFP/Getty 2/8 At least 60% of wild coffee species face extinction triggered by climate change and disease Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world\u2019s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change. The wild strain of arabica, the most widely consumed coffee on the planet, is among those now recognised as endangered, raising concerns about its long-term survival. These results are worrying for the millions of farmers around the world who depend on the continued survival of coffee for their livelihoods. As conditions for coffee farming become tougher, scientists predict the industry will need to rely on wild varieties to develop more resilient strains Alan Schaller 3/8 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are melting The Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown. More than half an inch has been added to global sea levels since 1979, but if current trends continue it will be responsible for metres more in future, the Nasa-funded study found. The international effort used aerial photos, satellite data and climate models dating back to the 1970s across18 Antarctic regions to get the most complete picture to date on the impacts of the changing climate. It found that between 1979 and 1990 Antarctica lost an average of 40 gigatonnes (40 billion tonnes) of its mass each year. Between 2009 and 2017 it lost an average 252 gigatonnes a year. This has added 3.6mm per decade to sea levels, or around 14mm since 1979, the study shows Nasa/Getty 4/8 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industry Greater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry. All of the region\u2019s 10 councils are to implement planning policies which create a \u201cpresumption\u201d against drilling for shale gas in their areas, Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has announced. Campaigners said the move was the latest sign that the tide was turning against fracking, which has been the subject of multiple legal battles across the country. Critics of fracking say it poses environmental and health risks. Drilling at the UK\u2019s only operational fracking site, run by Cuadrilla in Lancashire, has repeatedly been halted due to earth tremors. But ministers support the industry and last year unveiled plans to accelerate the development of new drilling sites Ross Wills 5/8 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next year Japan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community. Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said his nation would leave the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to resume hunting the marine mammals in Japanese waters. However, he stated the activity would be limited to Japan\u2019s territory and the 200 mile exclusive economic zone along its coasts.

Activists cautiously welcomed elements of the plan, saying \u201cimportant progress\u201d had been made on ensuring that efforts to tackle climate change by individual nations can be measured and compared. But environmental groups were also highly critical of the agreement, warning it lacked ambition and clarity on key issues, including financing for climate projects for developing countries.

Drawing on more than 6,000 scientific studies and compiled over two years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) findings, released this morning, warn enormous and rapid changes to the way everyone on Earth eats, travels and produces energy need to be brought in immediately.

It\u2019s contributed to some of the increase in global warming we\u2019ve seen and shale gas is a major player.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental advocates and former EPA officials had already said they expected the new methane plan to go further than previous proposals, with a goal of exempting companies from requirements to detect and stop methane leaks at existing oil and gas sites.\n\n\u201cEssentially, this is the umpteenth iteration of the EPA\u2019s exercise to define away its Clean Air Act authority ... to address air pollution and greenhouse gases,\u201d said Joseph Goffman, an EPA air official under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is the US\u2019s primary source of methane emissions, according to the EPA, accounting for nearly one-third in 2016.\n\nSome figures in the oil industry have dismissed concerns about the impact of the rule change, saying the direct immediate effect on methane emissions would be negligible. Controls on other, regulated pollutants would also capture methane in the pipeline, said Erik Milito of the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nThe Obama-era methane limits had \u201ca disproportionate effect on small businesses\u201d in the oil industry, Mr Milito added.\n\nBut the rollbacks on regulations on emissions from oilfields, storage sites and pipelines have split the oil industry, with some companies concerned about growing backlash to the policy in a world increasingly aware of the climate change crisis.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell this year urged the administration to crack down \u2013 not ease up \u2013 on emissions. Nonetheless, many others in the oil and gas industry have welcomed Mr Trump\u2019s approach.\n\nThe latest rollback \u201chighlights the Trump administration\u2019s complete contempt for our climate\u201d, said Kassie Siegel of the Centre for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe EPA is now so determined to actually increase greenhouse pollution that it\u2019s even shrugging off concerns from oil and gas companies about gutting these protections.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration plans to revoke Obama-era regulations designed to prevent hazardous methane leaks from oil and gas drilling operations, in a move which has even surprised those in fossil fuel industries.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/29/19/fracking-usa.jpg"}
