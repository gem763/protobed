Without the credit payouts, it would have increased by 66%, Shim said. Coupled with soaring research and marketing costs and a sharp increase in overheads, Slack's pre-tax losses mushroomed more than 10-fold to about $364 million.\n\nThe group proactively awarded credits to all customers, regardless of whether they requested them or were affected by the outages, CEO Stewart Butterfield said on the call. \"Those policies are outrageously customer-centric,\" he added.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Slack has now tempered the \"exceptionally generous\" policy to reduce the risk of large hits to revenue in the future, Shim said.", "description": "Slack missed out on $8 million in revenue last quarter after its work communications platform went down for about two hours over the course of 92 days.&nb...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d70d5b12e22af4dd75b2103-2400/5d0b8dfae3ecba467d4ada33.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
