It\u2019s simple, but it beats sitting around.\n\nAs captured by Fortnite News, entering the Konami code brings up an old school shooter minigame where a slice of pizza and a pineapple-shooting burger face off. It\u2019s a reference to the game\u2019s fast food rivals, Pizza Pit and Durr Burger. On my PC, this worked for me when I used my arrow and letter keys and the enter button. The Konami code, if you don\u2019t know, is up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start (or enter, on your PC). I was able to control the minigame with my mouse. The buttons, of course, depend on your platform.\n\nIf you do the Konami code, you can play a minigame while you wait.
