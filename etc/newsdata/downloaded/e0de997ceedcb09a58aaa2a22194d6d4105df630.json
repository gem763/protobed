Some 250,000 workers have been on strike for nearly a month and the prolonged standoff has forced parts suppliers to idle workers as well.\n\nOnce workers return to work and get back pay, they have to return any government benefits they received to tide them over.\n\nThe more stable monthly average of new claims, meanwhile, edged up by 1,000 to 213,750 nationwide. The four-week average usually gives a more accurate read into labor-market conditions than the more volatile weekly number.\n\nThe number of people already collecting unemployment benefits, known as continuing claims, increased by 29,000 to 1.68 million. These claims have been below 2 million since early 2017.\n\nRead: U.S. adds 136,000 jobs in September, unemployment rate hits 50-year low\n\nBig picture: The U.S. labor market has cooled off along with the economy. The number of job openings have fallen 8% since January and hiring has also slowed sharply.\n\nEconomists blame the ongoing trade war with China and the waning effects of the Trump tax cuts of 2017, among other things. The U.S. can avoid recession, however, if layoffs and unemployment remain low and consumers remain fairly confident in the economy, they say.\n\nRead: Consumer inflation flat in September, CPI shows, giving Fed room to cut rates\n\nWhat they are saying? \u201cFirms have sharply cut back hiring plans, without increasing the pace of layoffs,\u201d said chief economist Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201c That\u2019s normal in the early stages of a downturn. If growth slows further, as we expect, layoffs will rise in due course.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.98% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.99% rose in Thursday trades for the second straight day. Stocks broke a recent slide the day before on renewed hopes that U.S.-China trade tensions will ease as both countries resume talks.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +4.02% jumped to 1.65%.\n\n", "description": "Applications for unemployment benefits fell in the first week of October and clung near a 50-year low, suggesting that layoffs in the U.S. still haven\u2019t...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT002_jobs_h_ZG_20191009160712.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
