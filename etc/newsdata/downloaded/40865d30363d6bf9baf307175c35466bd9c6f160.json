More\n\nSource: Carsten Reisinger / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince then though, GE stock has been consolidating in a mostly sideways pattern. However, that sideways pattern is starting to develop into a rather negative look. That\u2019s even as General Electric stock has remained well-above its December lows.\n\nIt has got investors wondering if there\u2019s been a \u201cchange in tune\u201d with GE stock and if the sideways action will result in dead money \u2014 or worse, losses \u2014 rather than resolve higher. Before diving into the company, let\u2019s look at the technicals.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrading General Electric Stock\n\nWe have been covering General Electric stock here on InvestorPlace for quite some time. It\u2019s no wonder, given its former place among America\u2019s blue-chip companies. That\u2019s no longer the case, even among its own industry. Names like Honeywell (NYSE:HON), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) are all considered superior entities.\n\nIn any regard, we kept such a close eye on GE stock because of its tight trading range. Specifically, we continued to highlight range support at $9 and range resistance near $10.50. The latter elevated itself to around $10.70 in June and July, but we\u2019ve seen a drastic shift in sentiment since.\n\nchart of General Electric stock More\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nInterestingly enough, those range levels have now doubled in significance, as it highlights two key Fibonacci retracements. The 38.2% retracement sits up at $10.60, while the 61.8% rests at $8.99.\n\nThe question now is, can GE stock reclaim former range support and the 61.8% near $9?\n\nLast month, General Electric stock traded down to support and gapped below it, plunging to $7.65. On the subsequent retest though, this former support level acted as resistance, as GE again pulled back to sub-$8 levels. That\u2019s where the \u201cchange in tune\u201d reference comes in.\n\nNow just under $9 again, bulls need to make a strong showing. If General Electric stock can reclaim the $9 level, it puts the 200-day moving average at $9.25 and the 50-day moving average at about $9.50 on the table.\n\nGE stock will need to reclaim those two key moving averages in order to get back to range resistance near $10.60.\n\nIf $9 acts as resistance, August support at $8 is a possibility. Below that and the August lows, and sub-$7 is on the table.\n\nKey Analyst Will Move GE Stock\n\nA key catalyst for General Electric stock has been JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa.\n\nTusa upgraded GE from underweight to neutral in December, sparking an enormous rally. To be clear, he wasn\u2019t bullish, just less bearish given that the stock had gone from $30 to $7 in a relatively short period of time.\n\nThroughout the past few quarters \u2014 through earnings and investor presentations \u2014 Tusa has been critical of the company and of management\u2019s outlook. He has since gone back to his underweight rating. About a month ago, he wrote that the company\u2019s fundamentals \u201ccontinue to look negative.\u201d\n\nHe still maintains an underweight rating and $5 price target on the stock, implying more than 45% downside.\n\nGE Stock Growth\n\nFor the most recent quarter, General Electric stock beat on earnings and revenue expectations. It also provided better-than-expected guidance. But not everything was perfect in the quarter.\n\nFor one, GE warned about headaches stemming from the grounding of Boeing\u2019s (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes. Specifically, GE\u2019s cash flow could take a $1.4 billion hit if the planes remain grounded all year. It could also impact guidance.", "description": "Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) had enjoyed a strong 2019.
