Asked if he considered Mr Trump to be illegitimate, he said: \"Based on what I just said, which I can't retract.\"\n\nThe investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller concluded that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election \"in sweeping and systematic fashion\" with the goal of helping Mr Trump and harming Ms Clinton.\n\nBut the report drew no conclusion about whether the interference changed the result, and did not establish a criminal conspiracy by the Trump campaign.\n\nEPA/MATTEO BAZZI More\n\nMs Clinton compared her election loss to \"applying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado. And so I know that he knows that this wasn't on the level. I don't know that we'll ever know what happened.\"\n\nMs Clinton, who was joined by her daughter, Chelsea, for the interview to promote their new book about women in history, also discussed her support for an impeachment inquiry into Mr Trump.\n\nShe said there are \"a number of grounds\" for it but that the latest news about his phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukranian president, when the US president asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Mr Biden's son, is \"incredibly troubling\".\n\nShe compared Mr Trump's latest effort to spread negative stories about Mr Biden, who is leading in most polls to be the 2020 Democratic nominee, to what he did to her during their campaign.\n\n\"The most outrageously false things were said about me,\" Ms Clinton said. \"And unfortunately, enough people believed them. So this is an effort to sow these falsehoods against Biden.\n\n\"And I don't care if you're for the [Democrats] or you're a Republican, when the president of the United States, who has taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, uses his position to in effect extort a foreign government for his political purposes, I think that is very much what the founders worried about in high crimes and misdemeanours.\"", "description": "Hillary Clinton dismissed Donald Trump as an \"illegitimate president\" and suggested that \"he knows\" that he stole the 2016 presidential election in a CBS News interview to be aired on Sunday.The former secretary of state, who lost the presidency to Mr Trump, offered a scathing assessment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yzDsM5_TsOMzULrnp0gHvQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/5bc8f596fabf062aaa86cef6590cdd70", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
