From the aeroplane window it\u2019s more of the same: flat, empty and endlessly vast. At 30,000 feet, a few lonely lakes polka-dot the landscape. There is no evidence of human activity. There are scarcely any trees and few distinguishing landmarks. On and on it goes \u2013 Kazakhstan is the size of western Europe, and so unremittingly flat, it\u2019s as if some gigantic plasterer has skimmed the land. Here wolves outnumber people. Little wonder the Soviets chose this vast emptiness to hide their Gulags and their space programme, and to test their nuclear weapons. Much of it radioactive, it\u2019s an agoraphobic\u2019s vision of hell.\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, Astana comes glistening into view, all shiny metal and glass, implausibly rising up from the Kazakh steppe like some post-modern lego set that has stumbled into the opening sequence of Dallas. Welcome to Astana, one of the strangest capital cities on earth.\n\nThere was some early talk of Astana \u2013 which means \u201ccapital\u201d in Kazakh \u2013 being named after the president, Nursultan Nazarbayev. After all, his name and vision are omnipresent. Since independence from the USSR in 1991, he was the first \u2013 and has been the only \u2013 president of the Republic of Kazakhstan, with an electoral victory earlier this year in which he received a comedy 97.7% of the vote.\n\n\n\nThere was some talk of Astana being named after President Nazarbayev. After all, his name and vision are omnipresent\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Astana\u2019s Presidential Palace \u2013 like a Disney version of the White House.

Many Kazakh officials are quite open about it: they have chosen to do economic development first, and proper democracy (they hope) will come at some point later.\n\nGiven the billions of barrels of oil and gas that have been discovered in the country, and its very low population of only 16 million, every Kazakhstani should be a millionaire by now. One look at Astana and you can see where much of the money has gone: everywhere it\u2019s big, flashy signature buildings, all wearing their architects\u2019 names like fashion labels, all competing for attention like a collection of spoiled teenagers insecurely shouting: \u201cLook at me!\u201d\n\nTake the Norman Foster-designed Khan Shatyr shopping centre, on the road into town from the airport. It\u2019s the world\u2019s largest marquee with total area of 127,000 sq metres and a height along the spire of 150 metres. A special chemical lining protects those inside from the brutal icy winter and helps it maintain its special microclimate. The artificial beach, with sand specially imported from the Maldives, requires a constant 35C. All shopping centres need a beach, of course.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Norman Foster\u2019s Khan Shatyr shopping centre is the world\u2019s largest marquee.

A towering set of apartments built to match Moscow University in the Stalinist empire style. A Disney version of the White House. A vase-like tower with a ball on top that the president apparently designed on the back of a napkin during a state dinner. A finance ministry shaped as a dollar bill.\n\nFew of these buildings seem to have been designed with practicality in mind. The lifts in the pyramid go up, then left, then up, then left \u2013 it must have been incredibly expensive to get them to waltz like that. My hotel has an impressive light show on the outside of the building \u2026 and terrible Wi-Fi.\n\nWhen the capital was moved here from Almaty in 1997, there was little enthusiasm among government officials who were forced to relocate. Almaty \u2013 which finds out this week if it has been successful in its bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics \u2013 is more than a thousand kilometres further south, and is a much older and considerably classier affair. This is where Prince Harry enjoyed his winter holiday with Cressida Bonas in 2014, and where government officials spent long weekends cooking plov at their luxury dachas styled on English country houses.\n\nGiven the billions of barrels of oil and gas, and the low population, every Kazakhstani should \u200bbe a millionaire by now\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Few of Astana\u2019s buildings seem to have been designed with practicality in mind. Photograph: Jose Fuste Raga/Corbis\n\nThe official reason for relocating to Astana \u2013 previously the provincial settlement of Tselinograd, with a crumbling Soviet housing stock \u2013 was Almaty\u2019s location in an earthquake-prone region. But its close proximity to the Chinese border and Kazakhstan\u2019s need to strengthen its hold on the north of the country with its large number of ethnic Russians made it logical from a strategic point of view. In this regard, the comparison with Ukraine is instructive: both have high Russian populations.\n\n\n\nHowever, Nazarbayev is playing wise, carefully manoeuvring between Russia, China and the US, and is duly credited for encouraging intra-ethnic \u2013 and indeed, intra-religious \u2013 harmony. There are several large mosques in Astana, but also churches and synagogues. The baby-blue Beit Rachel synagogue is the largest in central Asia. With the threat of militant Islam on its southern border, healthy ecumenical relations are not just a communal nicety; they are a strategic necessity.\n\nBurma's bizarre capital: a super-sized slice of post-apocalypse suburbia Read more\n\nOther positives include Astana\u2019s new university. Opened in 2010, and named after Nazarbayev (who else?), it is a point of pride for many that foreign academics staff many of the departments. Indeed, education has become a legacy issue for the 75-year-old so-called \u201cfather of the nation\u201d. Nazarbayev has made it possible for school graduates to study overseas, all expenses paid, provided they return to Kazakhstan to work for at least five years after graduation.\n\nMany of this new breed of foreign-educated Kazakhstanis now make their careers in Astana. Nothing whatsoever like that famous anti-hero of Kazakhstan, Borat, these new go-getting graduates increasingly dominate what is a young city both in terms of its age \u2013 Astana celebrated its 17th birthday on 6 July this year (the same day as the president\u2019s) \u2013 and overall demographic. You don\u2019t see many over-50s out on the streets.\n\nThis flashy toy-city is locked in a fascinating negotiation between a Soviet command-and-control past and an aspirational, market-savvy present. But out on the edge of town, all the architecture stops abruptly. All the frantic energy comes to a halt, and the vast unremitting steppe suddenly begins. Which is why Astana feels like some great existentialist parable, an attempt to overcome the terror of endless emptiness with the frantic distraction of human endeavour.\n\nFrom 30,000 feet, let alone sub specie aeternitatis, it seems that Norman Foster doesn\u2019t really stand a chance. But who knows?\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion", "description": "In a country rich with oil money, the flashy buildings of Astana rise up implausibly from the flat Kazakh plains to form a city stuck between a Soviet past and an aspirational present", "authors": ["Giles Fraser"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/23/1437647965328/aedaf4d0-d6b7-467e-b180-65bf1b419c97-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a37a1024dd77b93c962bc2137b50bc5", "published_at": "2015-07-28"}
