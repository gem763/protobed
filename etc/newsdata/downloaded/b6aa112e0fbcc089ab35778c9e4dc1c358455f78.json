REUTERS/James Akena\n\n(Reuters) - Fashion chain Boohoo (BOOH.L) defied weak consumer confidence and reported a jump in its first-half pretax profit on Wednesday because of strong demand for brands such as PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, and helped by celebrity campaigns.\n\nManchester-based Boohoo has been an online success story with millions of active customer accounts across brands, drawing in more younger consumers who shop on their mobile phones and share fashion tips through social media.\n\nThe social-media friendly company, which has teamed up with television celebrities and models, said it has 6 million followers on Instagram and 3 million Facebook likes.\n\nThe online retailer, which raised its full-year revenue forecast earlier this month, said pretax profit rose 83% to 45.2 million pounds for the six months ended Aug. 31.\n\n\u201cOther retailers may suffer from weak consumer confidence and hot weather, but Boohoo has posted an acceleration in total sales growth ... but the surprise came from UK multi-brand sales growth,\u201d Jefferies analysts said of the first-half, which beat the brokerage\u2019s expectations.\n\nRevenue rose 43% to 564.9 million pounds, with PrettyLittleThing growing in France and the United States while Nasty Gal, whose revenue more than doubled, performed well in the U.S.\n\nAIM-listed Boohoo\u2019s shares, which are up nearly 60% for the year, were down 1.9% at 0803 GMT, in what one trader said was due to profit-taking.", "description": "Fashion chain Boohoo defied weak consumer confidence and reported a jump in its first-half pretax profit on Wednesday because of strong demand for brands such as PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, and helped by celebrity campaigns.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433670140&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0EB", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
