"Tutankhamun collection heads to London before last ever UK exhibit", "language": "en", "text": "A treasure trove of Egyptian artefacts found in Tutankhamun's tomb is being shipped to London where it will be showcased in the UK for the last time.\n\nJewellery, weapons and statues belonging to the boy king comprise the largest collection of his treasures to ever go on display, in celebration of the 100-year anniversary since the ancient ruler's burial site was discovered.\n\nSome 160 artefacts will form the Treasures Of The Golden Pharaoh exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery from November 2, 2019 to May 3, 2020.\n\nThe British capital is the third of 10 cities on the worldwide tour which will conclude at the Grand Egyptian Museum near the pyramids of Giza where the collection will remain forever.\n\nThe items have been uninstalled from Paris's Grande Halle de la Villette, where they were on display from March to September and drew more than 1.4million visitors, making it France's most-visited exhibition of all time.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nTechnicians at the Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris pack the Colossal, the largest artefact in the exhibition\n\nA gilded wooden

UK, the third city on the worldwide tour\n\nWeighing a total of 15.6 tonnes, the artefacts have travelled in custom-built inner crates and outer crates to ensure there is no movement while in transit.\n\nThe items require 48 hours to acclimatise after being transported before the crates are opened, and there are specific controls for temperature and light inside the exhibition cases to keep them in top condition.\n\nEgyptian restorers have been embedded with the team throughout the tour, and one has remained with the artefacts in all locations and while they are travelling.\n\nMuseums consultant and collections manager Jackie Hoff said: 'I've got 25-plus years' experience doing this, and this is the most complex show I've ever dealt with.\n\n'The size of the material, the status and preciousness of everything, the fragility of every single piece, it really takes a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of communication and co-ordination to pull it all off.'\n\nEgyptologist Dr Chris Naunton said: 'Visitors to the exhibition, when it arrives in London, are going to see a cleverly-selected series of items relating to Tutankhamun's life.\n\n'[They will also relate to] the moment of his death and what happens to the burial, the body and the tomb, and ultimately what happens to Tutankhamun \u2013 in the Egyptian mindset \u2013 in the afterlife as well.\n\nA wooden guardian statue of the Ka of the King wearing the Nemes headcloth, shown in Paris's Grande Halle de la Villette\n\nTechnicians pack the Colossal, which is among the 160-piece treasure collection that attracted over 1.4million visitors in Paris\n\n'Visitors will see everything from trappings that were placed on the mummy, jewellery that was placed on the body, items that might have been associated with activities he was involved in had he gone into battle \u2013 daggers, arrows, shields, boxes for furniture, clothing.\n\n'It's the full range of things that somebody of his status would have had in life and taken with him to the afterlife.'\n\nAmong the items display are a life-sized wooden guardian statue of the king and a miniature canopic coffin that formed part of the mummification process.\n\nThere is also a gilded wooden bed, a ceremonial item which is believed to have been created for Tutankhamun's funeral to keep evil forces at bay.\n\nTutankhamun, who ascended to the throne as a child in 1333BC, frail and with numerous health complaints, was buried in the Valley of the Kings.\n\nEgyptian restorers have been embedded with the team throughout the tour, and one has remained with the artefacts in all locations and while they are travelling\n\nA gold inlaid pectoral chain, and counterpoise with Lapis scarab flanked by Uraei is removed from its

landmark discovery of the tomb filled with royal treasures brought to light almost perfectly-preserved artefacts from a vanished civilisation, and it has captivated the world ever since.\n\nFollowing the tour, produced by the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and IMG, the funerary objects will return to the land where the pharaoh was laid to rest.\n\nPrevious London-based exhibitions of objects from Tutankhamun's tomb in 1972 and 2007 drew huge crowds and, due to high demand for the forthcoming show, the organisers have announced extended morning and evening session tickets for the opening weeks of the exhibit.\n\nIn addition to the extended hours, there will be a programme of 'lates', which will take place on the penultimate Friday of November and December and will include drinks and music.\n\nTutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh presented by Viking Cruises opens at the Saatchi Gallery on November 2.
