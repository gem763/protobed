Ellen DeGeneres responds to people angered by video of her laughing with George W. Bush at the Cowboys\u2019 game", "language": "en", "text": "As Twitchy told you Sunday night, Ellen DeGeneres was spotted sitting in a suite at Cowboys Stadium with former President George W. Bush. As you might imagine, video of the two sharing a laugh at the game angered a lot of people, and DeGeneres has responded to the criticism perfectly:\n\nYes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend. Here\u2019s the whole story. pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 8, 2019\n\nThat was great!\n\nI \u2764\ufe0f @TheEllenShow and I don't care who knows it. https://t.co/sufHNDunBk \u2014 Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) October 8, 2019\n\nTHIS is what America needs more of. https://t.co/ojbGJHSJUK \u2014 Beth Baumann (@eb454) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cJust because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them.\u201d https://t.co/FeQcHozVEm \u2014 James Hasson (@JamesHasson20) October 8, 2019\n\nBeautifully said \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc4f \u2014 Trevor Donovan \ud83d\udc36 (@TrevDon) October 8, 2019\n\nPeople need to be more like Ellen. https://t.co/II8hRy3KyC \u2014 Ken Gardner (@KenGardner11) October 8, 2019\n\nJust wonderful.\n\nIf only our public discourse had a lot more of this, and a lot less of the poisonous political stuff. https://t.co/8x4XDIbUnL \u2014 Jeff Jacoby (@Jeff_Jacoby) October 8, 2019\n\nAmerica might have a few years left after all. https://t.co/j1tw4vpk3Z \u2014 Jeryl Bier (@JerylBier) October 8, 2019\n\nThis is fantastic https://t.co/K0QS5lrDjp \u2014 Ben McDonald (@Bmac0507) October 8, 2019\n\nWe are now at the point where Ellen has to publicly explain why she \u2013 \"gay Hollywood liberal\" \u2013 was sitting next to George W. Bush \u2013 \"conservative Republican president\" \u2013 at the Cowboys game. And she handles it so beautifully. https://t.co/9luG06HeFN \u2014 Caroline Overington (@overingtonc) October 8, 2019\n\nWell done indeed. Suffice to say not everyone agreed, which makes Ellen\u2019s point even more effective.", "description": "\"Here's the whole story...\"", "authors": ["Doug P.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bushellen.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
