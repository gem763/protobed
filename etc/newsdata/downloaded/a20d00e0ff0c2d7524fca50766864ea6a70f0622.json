They are most often praised by pros who have played them, with Royal Melbourne and Metropolitan, where Clayton is a member, generally regarded as the pick of the bunch.\n\nRoyal Melbourne will host the Presidents Cup in December for the third time - it\u2019s where the International Team won its only previous tournament against the United States in 1998.\n\n\u201cThe sandbelt courses in Australia are among the best in the world and some of my favorites to play,\u201d Tiger Woods, who will captain the U.S. team and could play as well, said during a promotional visit to Melbourne.\n\nHere are some other things to know about the sandbelt courses, and Royal Melbourne in particular.\n\n\u2018CLAYTS\u2019 PATCH\n\n\u201cThe bunkers, as much as anyone tries to copy, they never work,\u201d Clayton, known as \u2018Clayts\u2019 among his fellow pros and friends, said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nThe sandbelt courses are considered to be Royal Melbourne, Victoria, Metropolitan, Huntingdale, Commonwealth, Yarra Yarra, Kingston Heath and Peninsula. They are all close to one another - Victoria is across the road from Royal Melbourne - making it popular with tourists lucky enough to garner an invitation to even a few of the prized clubs. In this case, who you know means everything.\n\n\u201cAlister MacKenzie came down and built those shapes, the sand-faced bunker, and it worked so well,\u201d the Melbourne-born Clayton said. \u201cThey have a great bunch of difficult par-4s, a great group of mid-length par-3s from 140 and 170 yards. At least 20 world-class holes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are the best group of courses in the world with New York and London. But if you were to pick out one thing, you would talk about those par-3s.\u201d\n\nIn 1931, two years before MacKenzie designed Augusta National in Georgia, home of the Masters, the British golf course architect designed the West Course at Royal Melbourne.\n\nCOURSE MANAGEMENT\n\nRichard Forsyth has been golf course superintendent at Royal Melbourne for 10 years. Before that, he spent 15 years at Metropolitan, where golfers who showed up for the 2001 World Match-Play Championship won by Steve Stricker said they often mistook the fairways for greens because of the immaculate growth from the sandy loam soil.\n\nAsked if he pinches himself with his good fortune to have been in charge of two of the best sandbelt courses for so long, Forsyth says: \u201cI often certainly believe that.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoyal Melbourne is the most dramatic of the sandbelt courses with the sand dunes, the closest sand belt course to the bay and the beach, and the most rolling terrain,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cIt also has the most dramatic elevation change.\u201d\n\nForsyth says the weather has been cooperating in the lead-up to the Presidents Cup, with above-average rainfall over recent months.\n\nTHE COURSE\n\nThe Presidents Cup will feature a composite course at Royal Melbourne, which was first used 60 years ago to host the World Cup, then known as the Canada Cup.\n\nIt contains 12 holes from the West Course and six from the Alex Russell-designed East course. The composite course, which is the norm for major tournaments, includes what many believe to be the best of both courses. But logistically, it means golfers don\u2019t have to cross a busy road during their rounds.\n\nForsyth says they\u2019ll start paying extra attention to the holes on the composite course in mid-November.\n\n\u201cWe try to consistently manage both courses, at same time, same level,\u201d he said. \u201cTo bring the two together is not a big shift.\u201d\n\nThe first 10 holes of the composite course are from the West course, followed by the six from the East, and closing with usual first and second holes from the West.\n\nEARLY CHRISTMAS\n\nThe Presidents Cup is set for Dec. 12-15. After its only loss in 1998, the American team won in a return to Royal Melbourne in 2011.\n\nThe eight qualifiers for the Americans are Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, Matt Kuchar and Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nThe International team will be led by Marc Leishman, Louis Oosthuizen, Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama, who have a combined 17 Presidents Cup appearances. The four newcomers to the event will be Abraham Ancer, Haotong Li, Cameron Smith and C.T. Pan.\n\nFour captains\u2019 picks will be added. For the International team that will likely include Australian favorite Jason Day.\n\nInternational captain Ernie Els said his team will try to overcome the odds to beat the Americans for only the second time in 21 years.\n\n\u201cPeople are not giving us much of a chance. I mean, the whole of the U.S. team is in the top 20,\u201d Els said. \u201cWe have one player in the top 20, and that\u2019s just the way it is. But somebody is going to win 15\u00bd points, and at the end of the day, that\u2019s our aim.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former Australian and European Tour professional Michael Clayton reckons he's played Melbourne's so-called sandbelt courses about 1,000 times.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Passa"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/australia_golf_swinging_through_the_sandbelt_74355_c0-125-2994-1870_s1770x1032.jpg?c976383d1fbe9e61f4351ea5111f30a35f6f5a92", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
