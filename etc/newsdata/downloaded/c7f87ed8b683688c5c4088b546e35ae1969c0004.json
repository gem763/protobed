Researchers also say the presence of city planners, in addition to perceptions of climate risk and political will, may also play a role.\n\nThat could mean, however, people who need assistance the most are not receiving it.\n\nThe benefits that result from buyouts are not necessarily monetary. In fact, the resulting open space may provide even greater benefits to urban areas for use in recreation or community revitalization, researchers said.\n\nGrant applications to FEMA are submitted via states, territories, or federally recognized tribes and buyouts are typically administered by local governments.\n\nWithin the counties receiving buyouts, they tended to be used in poorer, less-densely populated areas. It was not clear exactly why this was the case.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe six states with the most bought-out properties were in the top 10 states for cumulative flood-related property damage: Missouri, Texas, Illinois, North Carolina, Iowa and New Jersey.\n\nThe study analyzed about 40,000 voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties from 1989 to 2017. The average time it took to complete a buyout was more than five years.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "These counties typically had higher income, education and population density.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/Oklahoma-Floods.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
