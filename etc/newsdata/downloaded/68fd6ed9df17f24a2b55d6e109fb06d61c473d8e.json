She takes accountability. She takes responsibility, and mind you, this is her perspective, her story, and she's the first one to say that.\n\nCandid book: The 56-year-old actress, shown last month in New York City, has been promoting her new memoir Inside Out\n\n'She's allowing herself to show everyone that you can go through some really difficult, hard things, and you can still be someone who is thriving and taking accountability and just being a strong survivor without being, 'Oh, I survived this and this is who I am because of this story'',' Rumer added.\n\nDemi also has a third 28-year-old daughter, Scout, with Bruce.\n\nBruce, 64, and Demi were married from 1987 to 2000.\n\nDemi and Ashton Kutcher, 41, were married from 2005 until 2013.", "description": "The 56-year-old actress while being supported at a book event by daughters Rumer and Tallulah said she likes to 'celebrate' her losses.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/02/19865884-0-image-a-11_1571363796755.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
