She claimed her 25th medal less than two hours later.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know how I do it sometimes,\u201d Biles told reporters. \u201cSometimes I wonder how I do it. I feel like it\u2019s just like not me. I wish I could have an out-of-body experience to witness it because sometimes I think I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d\n\nBiles scored 15.066 on the beam after a spectacular routine, choosing a simpler dismount over the double-double she executed earlier in the World Championships. China won the silver and bronze medals with Liu Tingting scoring 14.433 and Li Shijia scoring 14.3, respectively.\n\nBiles won the floor exercise by a full point, earning a score of 15.133 despite stepping out of bounds on one pass. U.S. teammate Sunisa Lee earned the silver medal, her third medal of the championships, while Russia\u2019s Angelina Melnikova won bronze.\n\nIn all, Biles took home five of the six gold medals to be won at the World Championships after claiming team competition gold Tuesday, individual all-around gold Thursday and vault gold Saturday.\n\nOf Biles\u2019 25 career world medals, 19 are gold. Out of Scherbo\u2019s 23 medals, 12 were gold.", "description": "Oct. 13 (UPI) \u2014 American star Simone Biles shattered the record for medals by a gymnast at the 2019 World Championships by winning gold medals on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
