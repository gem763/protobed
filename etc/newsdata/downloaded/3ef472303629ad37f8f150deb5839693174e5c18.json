Briscoe Cain on Friday defended recently saying that his semiautomatic rifle was \u201cready\u201d for Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nMr. Cain denied he threatened Mr. O\u2019Rourke with his remark on Twitter late Thursday, arguing to the contrary that the White House hopeful had threatened him by promising to confiscate legally owned firearms from Americans if elected president.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s threatened to trespass on my property and the property of others or to kick down our door and take from us,\u201d Mr. Cain said on Fox News. \u201cWhat I wrote really is just another way of saying \u2018Come and take it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Cain\u2019s \u201cCome and take it\u201d remark about his fellow Texan was a nod to a seminal moment in state history, the Battle of Gonzales, the first armed engagement of the Texas Revolution in October 1835 where a defiant band of Texians defeated Mexican troops who had been sent to confiscate their cannon.\n\n\u201cReally he is the one making the threat, right?\u201d asked Mr. Cain.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke, a former U.S. congressman from El Paso, faced criticism from gun rights advocates after making it clear during Thursday\u2019s third Democratic presidential primary debate that his administration would outlaw and confiscate certain military-style weapons used in several recent mass shootings.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said during the debate. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against a fellow American anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy AR is ready for you,\u201d Mr. Cain said on Twitter to Mr. O\u2019Rourke moments later.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke later said he considered Mr. Cain\u2019s tweet to be a death threat and alerted the FBI. Twitter said it violated its rules against threatening violence and was accordingly deleted from the platform.\n\nAsked on Fox News whether he had threatened Mr. O\u2019Rourke, Mr. Cain said \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come and take it,\u201d said Mr. Cain. \u201cTheir threat was against Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo crime has been committed,\u201d Mr. Cain separately told ABC13, adding that the FBI \u201cwon\u2019t be calling.\u201d\n\nNeither Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign or the FBI immediately returned messages requesting comment.\n\nVirtually all Democratic presidential candidates have proposed enacting gun control measures if elected. Mr. O\u2019Rourke passionately discussed the issue during Thursday\u2019s debate, urging for reform following a mass shooting claiming 22 lives last month in his home city of El Paso.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
