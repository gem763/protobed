Still, bullish sentiment faded over the last week, and is now at its lowest since last December.\n\nLocally, there's the RBA's latest Financial Stability Review later this morning.\n\nHere what NAB expects regarding the FSR:\n\n\"Governor Lowe in his speech on Tuesday highlighted three aspects of the FSR of particular interest:\n\n\"(i) A risk event or shock could cause the sudden repricing of credit spreads, which are currently quite low;\n\n\"(ii) The banking system is well placed to withstand shocks, but Lowe warned that the tightening in lending standards may have, 'swung a bit too far' and caused a slowdown in lending to small businesses; And\n\n\"(iii) Housing arrears have risen, but many households have a large savings buffer in their offset accounts and that mortgagees on average are 2.5 years ahead on their capital repayments, equivalent to 16% of household mortgage debt.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there's August retail sales data late this morning too.\n\nHere's what NAB expects: \"After a poor July, when retail trade fell by 0.1%, we expect a modest rebound in August with the NAB cashless retail sales series pointing to a 0.3% gain (consensus: 0.5%). This is a small rise given that the tax office has said that an extra $3.2b worth of net refunds had been paid in the 9 weeks to 3 September, relative to the previous year.\n\n\"We are mindful of the uncertainty around our estimate, with the risk that sales could be stronger, although the Reserve Bank minutes reported that 'liaison with retailers suggested that [the tax cuts] had yet to lift spending noticeably'.\"\n\nToday's agenda\n\nLocal: RBA Financial Stability Review at 11.30am AEST, Retail sales August, RBA assistant governor Ellis speaks at noon\n\nNAB on its FSR expectations:\n\nOverseas data: US non-farm payrolls September, Trade balance August; Fed speakers: Clarida, Rosengren and Bostic\n\nTD Securities on the pending US jobs data: \"We expect payrolls to increase by 150k in September, following the below-consensus 130k August print. Reflecting the retrenchment in manufacturing, jobs in the goods sector should stay soft as we expect manufacturing employment to remain subdued in the single-digit thousands.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarket highlights\n\nASX futures up 35 points or 0.5% higher to 6498 near 7.30am AEST\n\nAUD +0.5% to 67.41 US cents\n\nOn Wall St: Dow +0.5% S &P 500 +0.8% Nasdaq +1.1%\n\nIn New York: BHP +0.6% Rio +0.2% Atlassian +3.5%\n\nIn Europe: Stoxx 50 +0.1% FTSE -0.6% CAC +0.3% DAX closed\n\nNikkei 225 futures +0.2%\n\nSpot gold +0.5% to $US1507.10 an ounce near 2pm New York time\n\nBrent crude +0.3% to $US57.85 a barrel\n\nUS oil -0.4% to $US52.44 a barrel\n\nIron ore flat at $US93.38 a tonne\n\nChinese markets closed for national holidays\n\nLME aluminium +0.8% to $US1718 a tonne\n\nLME copper -0.3% to $US5662 a tonne\n\n2-year yield: US 1.39% Australia 0.62%\n\n5-year yield: US 1.35% Australia 0.62%\n\n10-year yield: US 1.53% Australia 0.92% Germany -0.59%\n\n10-year US/Australia yield gap near 6.40am AEST: 61 basis points\n\nFrom today's Financial Review\n\nWhy Scott Morrison is on the rise: The Prime Minister shows no signs of throwing away what he has earned and those close to him are basking in his power.\n\nDisruption time for banks: The decline in official interest rates will put the spotlight on the strategy of the big four banks to charge loyal customers more for their mortgages.\n\nSqueeze on banks a risk to the economy: \"This notion that our banks are earning super-normal profits is a complete fallacy,\" says Unisuper's John Pearce.\n\nUnited States\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWall Street stocks climbed on Thursday after data showing US services-sector activity at a three-year low fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates to stem a wider economic downturn.\n\nTrump says China's Xi should investigate the Bidens: Trump's China remarks came after he reiterated his call for Ukraine to look into one of his Democratic presidential rivals.\n\nUS services gauge misses most pessimistic forecast: The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index dropped 3.8 points to 52.6 in September, the lowest since August 2016.\n\nBullish US equity sentiment at 10-month low: The bull market is running low on bullish sentiment, according to the latest survey by the American Association of Individual Investors.\n\nMicrosoft rose 1.2% and Facebook added 2.7%, with the two contributing more than any other companies to the S &P 500\u2019s gain.\n\nCorona maker Constellation Brands fell 6.1% after it took an $839 million markdown in the value of its investment in pot firm Canopy Growth during the quarter.\n\nEurope\n\nEuro zone shares made small gains on Thursday after their worst sell-off in two months a day earlier, as a rebound in Airbus and spirits makers outweighed the latest round of weak economic data from the euro zone and the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe blue-chip and wider STOXX 600 pan-European indexes sank almost 3% on Wednesday after the World Trade Organisation approved 10% US tariffs on European-made Airbus planes and 25% duties on goods ranging from French wine to Scotch whisky.\n\nAfter the initial shock of the decision, intended by the Trump administration as punishment for illegal EU aircraft subsidies, traders judged the detailed list of products affected showed the actual economic impact should be minimal.\n\nThe tariffs were not a game-changer for Europe, said Wouter Sturkenboom, chief investment strategist EMEA & APAC at Northern Trust Asset Management. \"However if Trump decides to go after the auto sector, we'd take that to heart.\"\n\nAirbus, luxury stocks like Louis Vuitton-owner LVMH , and spirits makers Remy Cointreau and Pernod gained between 0.8% and 6.4% as a list showed that Washington had exempted some products from tariffs.\n\nData on Thursday showed a bigger-than-expected fall in euro zone producer prices and stalling business activity.\n\nThe euro zone index closed 0.1% higher, while the broader pan-region index closed down 0.02%.\n\nLondon's FTSE dropped 0.6% to close at its lowest since late August, having hit a seven month low earlier in the session.

The Bank stated global risks are skewed to the downside, employment growth is strong but likely to weaken, inflation pressures remain subdued and the economy still has spare capacity. Further, the RBA strengthened its language around the labour market, shifting the focus from 'reducing unemployment' to 'full employment'. Accordingly we bring forward the May'20 cut to Feb'20.\"\n\nThe real reason the Reserve Bank is cutting rates? Housing: The myth that house prices were being driven by a lack of new housing supply was clearly exposed by the royal commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommodities\n\nCapital Economics' Kieran Clancy said he expects the current \"melancholy\" in the metals market to persist for the rest of the calendar year. \"We think that global economic growth will slow further over the coming months and this, coupled with ailing investor sentiment, will continue to keep a lid on industrial metals prices this year. In contrast, subdued risk appetite should ensure that the prices of precious metals remain elevated.\"\n\nIn terms of copper and aluminium: Mr Clancy said: \"The prices of copper and aluminium drifted lower in September. Ailing investor sentiment should keep a lid on copper prices this year, despite copper\u2019s strong fundamentals. Meanwhile, we think that aluminium\u2019s fundamentals are consistent with a further fall in prices by end-2019.\"\n\nAs for nickel, iron ore and steel: \"The price of nickel fell in September, but remains elevated amid fears of a supply shortage stemming from Indonesia\u2019s 2020 export ban. Meanwhile, despite the China survey data pointing to weakness in the key construction sector, both iron ore and Chinese steel prices rose. As a further slowdown in construction activity takes its toll, we expect both prices to fall by end-year.\"\n\nThe Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index, which tracks rates for ships carrying dry bulk commodities, slid to a near two-month low on Thursday, as weak demand for iron ore and lower industrial activity continued to weigh on the index.\n\nThe Baltic index, which reflects rates for capesize, panamax and supramax vessels, declined 46 points, or 2.6%, to 1757, recording its seventh consecutive decline.\n\nThe overall index was at its lowest level since August 9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe capesize index fell 218 points, or 6.75%, to 3013, its lowest in three months.\n\nChina's week-long national celebrations have drastically reduced steel activity, said Randy Giveans, vice president, equity research at Jefferies.\n\nAustralian sharemarket\n\nASX whacked amid global stock rout: Australian shares have taken a second battering in as many days, as trade war developments and weak US data hit fragile investor confidence\n\nThe S &P/ASX200 Index slumped 146.9 points, or 2.2 per cent, to 6493 points.\n\nStreet Talk\n\nAnacacia Capital plants Roots in infrastructure sector\n\nRich Lister-backed software company seeks fresh funds\n\nNew number crunchers hired to help with ECA accounts", "description": "Australian shares are poised to close the week on a positive note, amid a surge in bets for an October US interest rate cut.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1968%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2c1dd0aa2087f072e7042e9b7df4c6ef3ffb5ac5", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
