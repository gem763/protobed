Last week, a building on the outskirts of the city asked the truck to park outside around midday so its employees could have Mexican food for lunch. But the building in Batavia, N.Y., was a federal detention center run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the hungry workers were mostly ICE employees. Within hours, the small business, which serves \u201cTricked Out Nachos\u201d and an \u201cEl Camino Bowl,\u201d was plunged into the crosshairs of the rancorous national debate over immigration.\n\nThe Times reported that it was an \u201cadditional insult\u201d that the truck was serving Mexican food outside of a building where some Latinos were likely housed.\n\n\u201cThe company first apologized on Thursday for a \u2018lapse in judgment\u2019 in sending a truck to the detention center on the previous day and then promised to evaluate all future locations and events to ensure they aligned with its values,\u201d the Times said. \u201cLloyd also pledged to donate the lunch profits to a local immigration advocacy organization.\u201d\n\nBut the initial reaction sparked criticism from those who support law enforcement.\n\n\u201cIn what world does a company feel the need to apologize for serving food to federal law enforcement officers who work in dangerous conditions?\u201d Rob Ortt, a Republican state senator and congressional candidate, said on Twitter, according to the Times. \u201cThe men and women who work to enforce our immigration laws and protect us deserve better.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame when small entrepreneurs get embroiled in something they are not giving a lot of thought to, when the big companies \u2014 Google, Facebook, drug companies \u2014 are always involved in this stuff,\u201d Susan McCartney, director of the Small Business Development Center at SUNY Buffalo State, said in the Times report.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "A food truck that serves Mexican food became the target of both supporters and critics after it served ICE personnel working at a detention center.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Abolish-ICE-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
