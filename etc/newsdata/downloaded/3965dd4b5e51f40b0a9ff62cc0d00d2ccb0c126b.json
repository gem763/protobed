I went away, I told you guys I was going away, (and) I asked everybody not to bug me because I needed the time. I took the extra time and I went away and I did whatever I wanted to do. I came back and I started doing rehab. It\u2019s been over two months now treating these injuries, and my finger is fine now, but my ankle is just not getting better.\n\n\u201cI did everything I could to be 100 percent by Dec. 7. The UFC knows, the [UFC Performance Institute] knows because I\u2019ve been there this whole time treating my injuries. It\u2019s just not happening.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to Gadelha\u2019s explanation in the post below:\n\nUpdate: A person with knowledge of the situation informed MMA Junkie early Wednesday morning that as it currently stands, Cynthia Calvillo will remain on the Dec. 7 card.
