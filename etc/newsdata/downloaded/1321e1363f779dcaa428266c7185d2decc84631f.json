Anthony Joshua names his dream fight", "language": "en", "text": "AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnthony Joshua says his dream fight would be to face Tyson Fury at Wembley.\n\nWhen asked what his ideal fight would be following his immediate focus of avenging his shock defeat to Ruiz Jr, Joshua said: \u201cI always change it, but right now, I\u2019d say Fury at Wembley. The best of Britain. It is a massive fight.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJoshua went on to insist that he would eventually fight both Fury and Deontay Wilder.\n\n\u201cYes, 100 per cent. That\u2019s like asking if a certain football team will play another football team. Of course. We\u2019re in the same division, in the same era. We have to fight each other.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all big draws in the heavyweight division so it would be massive. I\u2019d love to fight Wilder, I\u2019d love to fight Fury. I\u2019m fighting Ruiz Jr next. The list goes on \u2013 there\u2019s so many out there that I\u2019d love to compete with.\u201d\n\nBut fight fans will have to wait for Joshua\u2019s meeting with Fury and Wilder as he will first attempt to regain his IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles from Ruiz in a December rematch in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe British heavyweight suffered a shock defeat in New York in June, when he abruptly lost his world title and unbeaten record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a journey,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of highs and a lot of lows, from the amateurs to the pros. Through the process you gain experience which has led me to this point in my life.\u201d\n\nIf Ruiz is able to defeat Joshua for a second time he will establish himself as an elite heavyweight, but promoter Eddie Hearn says that Joshua has revamped his training to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cI think movement and looseness in this fight is quite important for him,\u201d Hearn told Sky Sports. \u201cHe\u2019s got to have that movement with him as well.\n\n\u201cI think with AJ, it\u2019s never about the weight, it\u2019s more about how he feels, how he\u2019s training, what he\u2019s doing.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAgainst [original opponent for the fight against Ruiz Jr] Jarrell Miller, it was more about size, because he was going to get walked down. He wanted to be big, strong, solid. Obviously against Ruiz, someone that\u2019s faster, it\u2019s probably better to be a little bit lighter and more fluid.\n\n\u201cI think there will probably be a little bit of focus on being that way in this fight, rather than preparing for Jarrell Miller, like they did for 70 per cent of their camp last time.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nJoshua\u2019s rematch with Ruiz Jr to go ahead despite Middle East tensions", "description": "Anthony Joshua says his dream fight would be to face Tyson Fury at Wembley.When asked what his ideal fight would be following his immediate focus of avenging his shock defeat to Ruiz Jr, Joshua said: \u201cI always change it, but right now, I\u2019d say Fury at Wembley.
