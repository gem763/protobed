Bitcoin Treads Trading Range Bottom After Crash", "language": "en", "text": "Bitcoin price (BTC) hovered near widely-predicted support levels on Oct. 24 after a day of carnage sent markets tumbling to five-month lows.\n\nCryptocurrency market daily overview.

Source: Coin360\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the losses had long been anticipated, with analysts almost exactly predicting the floor lying at Bitcoin\u2019s 200-day moving average \u2014 approximately $7,400.\n\nThe bottom in fact came at $7,360, while attention now focuses on Bitcoin\u2019s next move. A major factor potentially exerting pressure on price is governmental scrutiny of Libra, Facebook\u2019s proposed digital currency.\n\nThis week, the United States Congress again grilled CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a public hearing, during which Bitcoin also came in for criticism.\n\nBeyond external factors, meanwhile, price decreases could test a technical theory focusing on Bitcoin miners. According to some calculations, current miner profitability demands a Bitcoin price of at least $6,500.\n\nParticipation could drop \u2014 though likely temporarily due to the self-adjusting difficulty algorithm \u2014 if BTC/USD falls lower, as it did during the pit of the bear market in December 2018. Nevertheless, investment in mining infrastructure suggests that regardless of price performance, miners are bullish about the future.\n\nAltcoin markets enter an uneasy pause\n\nAltcoins meanwhile continued to see red as Bitcoin showed little sign of recovery. Having fallen around 8% during the dip, the top ten cryptocurrencies then lingered at lower levels.\n\nEther (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, nonetheless staved off heavier losses, dropping 3.5% to trade at $161 on Thursday.\n\nEther seven-day price chart.
