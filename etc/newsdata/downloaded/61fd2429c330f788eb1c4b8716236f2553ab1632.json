It is being sponsored by Iran and was written by...Maduro.\n\nNo joke: the U.N. Human Rights Council soon votes on a resolution on Venezuela's human rights record that was drafted by Venezuela itself\u2014diplomat F\u00e9lix Pe\u00f1a Ramos\u2014and sponsored by Iran. The text praises the Maduro regime's efforts on human rights, and instead attacks the West. pic.twitter.com/NxMq2vtcSE \u2014 Hillel Neuer - watching #UNGA #UNGA74 (@HillelNeuer) September 21, 2019\n\nThe State Department is less than impressed.\n\nWhen @realDonaldTrump rightfully withdrew from the biased @UNHumanRights it was due to hypocrisy like this. Iran, the world\u2019s top sponsor or terror, sponsoring a resolution calling for \u201cnon-interference\u201d for human rights abuses in Venezuela, WRITTEN by the corrupt Maduro regime! https://t.co/GUbVWphwjY \u2014 Morgan Ortagus (@statedeptspox) September 23, 2019\n\nFor the record, Maduro has been starving Venezuelans and forcing them to pledge allegiance to his regime before receiving basic humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies. He's also blocked aid from coming into the country for months. Venezuelans are eating zoo animals, cats, dogs and rifling through the trash for anything they can find.\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro and his oppressive regime turn the arrival of life-saving aid for Venezuelans into a clash of violence.

Ambassador Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo officially announced the United States was leaving the Human Rights Council in June 2018, citing its inability to actually condemn abuses and instead continues to prop up the world's most brutal dictators. For example, current members include Cuba, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, Afghanistan, China, North Korea, Pakistan and others.\n\n\"We have no doubt that there was once a noble vision for this council. But today, we need to be honest \u2013 the Human Rights Council is a poor defender of human rights. Worse than that, the Human Rights Council has become an exercise in shameless hypocrisy \u2013 with many of the world\u2019s worst human rights abuses going ignored, and some of the world\u2019s most serious offenders sitting on the council itself,\" Pompeo said at the time. \"The only thing worse than a council that does almost nothing to protect human rights is a council that covers for human rights abuses and is therefore an obstacle to progress and an impediment to change. The Human Rights Council enables abuses by absolving wrongdoers through silence and falsely condemning those who have committed no offense. A mere look around the world today demonstrates that the council has failed in its stated objectives.\"\n\nThe Council also has a long, harmful and unfounded agenda against Israel.\n\n\"When a so-called Human Rights Council cannot bring itself to address the massive abuses in Venezuela and Iran, and it welcomes the Democratic Republic of Congo as a new member, the council ceases to be worthy of its name. Such a council, in fact, damages the cause of human rights,\" Haley added. \"And then, of course, there is the matter of the chronic bias against Israel. Last year, the United States made it clear that we would not accept the continued existence of agenda item seven, which singles out Israel in a way that no other country is singled out. Earlier this year, as it has in previous years, the Human Rights Council passed five resolutions against Israel \u2013 more than the number passed against North Korea, Iran, and Syria combined. This disproportionate focus and unending hostility towards Israel is clear proof that the council is motivated by political bias, not by human rights.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": ".09/23/2019 13:24:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/23/074a286c-0d29-48a7-9b99-32e8951a11e0.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
