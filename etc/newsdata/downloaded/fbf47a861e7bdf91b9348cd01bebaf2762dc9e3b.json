Lagarde Will Seek to Heal ECB Policy Split With Review Plan\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.

Estonian governor Madis Muller said the discussion needs to open \u201cwithin quarters.\u201d Dutch governor Klaas Knot endorsed the review last week by proposing a symmetric band around the ECB\u2019s inflation aim, currently set at just under 2%.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Bloomberg, his Belgian colleague Pierre Wunsch said the ECB may at one point have to consider an escape clause from its pledge to keep interest rates ultra-low if the negative effects of loose policy start to bite.\n\nWithout Bias\n\nLagarde said that the ECB \u201cwill examine the benefits and risks of the various options without bias,\u201d and her goal was to \u201cget the members of the central-bank council involved at an early stage.\u201d\n\nLagarde\u2019s outreach follows a public feud among officials that sparked allegations that outgoing President Mario Draghi steamrolled the decision in September to restart quantitative easing against the Governing Council\u2019s will. About a third of policy makers opposed the new round of bond-buying and some have since signaled they would be reluctant to cut rates further below zero.\n\nMuller, who was among the opponents of QE in September, signaled he was looking forward to the review. \u201cMadame Lagarde is well-placed to take this forward,\u201d he told a panel in Warsaw on Friday.\n\nImproving Relations\n\nAsked about the row at his last press conference, Draghi said Thursday he doubted it would affect how he will be remembered as president. Lithuanian governor Vitas Vasiliauskas said on Friday the divergence of views makes institutions stronger, but added that the communication since the September meeting wasn\u2019t \u201cperfect and it impacted the signaling effect of our policies.\u201d\n\nLagarde\u2019s comments suggest she\u2019ll also aim to improve relations with Europe\u2019s largest economy, where the ECB has been vilified for hurting savers and contributing to a rise of the far-right. Draghi has often sparred over policy with Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann.\n\n\u201cI consider it one of my urgent tasks to make the euro, the central bank and its monetary policy available to a wider public,\u201d said the future ECB president. \u201cMario Draghi had his own style, I\u2019ll have my style.\u201d", "description": "Lagarde Will Seek to Heal ECB Policy Split With Review Plan", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE3G12A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
