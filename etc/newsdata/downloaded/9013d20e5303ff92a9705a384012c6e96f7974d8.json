The short noodles, cut by hand, had a tender spring. They were bound in a light, melting cloud of Parmesan. The result was simple, built on the retro American dishes that the chef, Thomas Keller, once wittily reimagined as high culture and maxed out to total extravagance.\n\nThe meal was structured a little oddly, jumping from a dish of poached lobster directly to an English muffin with a pool of burrata, which seemed like a cheese course, then to the macaroni and cheese. But regardless of the sequence, the dishes, and the ways they were delivered, reminded me of what\u2019s possible when both the kitchen and the wait staff are operating at the highest level: sustained indulgence in an atmosphere of total comfort.\n\nThe servers brought the gold-rimmed dish sets out and placed them down in unison. After lifting the egg tops and revealing the macaroni, they rained down a messy shower of black truffles, half on the food and half on the table, filling the air with perfume.\n\nIt was a stunning production. But the oversize golden egg on a series of gold plates did seem archaic \u2014 and not just because the French Laundry has used this presentation, for various dishes, for years. In the Trump era, gold seems a bit too eager to assert its value.\n\nI found the most vivid moments at the French Laundry were more quiet and unexpected \u2014 a gleaming lump of sea urchin with a little spicy mango pur\u00e9e, served with no fanfare.\n\nAt the end of a meal, caught up in conversation with friends, I forgot about my espresso. A few minutes went by and maybe the coffee cooled, and the toffee-colored crema dissipated. Without asking or making a show of it, a server brought out a hot one to replace it. The staff exuded confidence and warmth, and their attentiveness was thorough ( even after the check was paid) but never intrusive.", "description": "The French Laundry, the Restaurant at Meadowood and SingleThread have much in common: amazing precision, sky-high prices and a sedating sort of predictability.", "authors": ["Tejal Rao"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/17Napa1/17Napa1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
