Organisers cancelled the England-France match planned in Yokohama, near Tokyo, and New Zealand-Italy game in Toyoda, in central Japan.\n\nOrganizers also cancelled a marathon in Sendai and other northern coastal towns, and Formula One auto racing in Suzuka in central Japan may also be affected.\n\nHagibis, which means speed in Filipino, had maximum sustained winds of up to 270 kilometres and stronger gusts at noon Thursday near Chichi island in the Pacific, about 1000 kilometres off Tokyo's southern coast. It was moving north at the speed of 20 kph and is expected to weaken over cooler waters as it nears Japan's main island.\n\nIt's the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency says the typhoon is forecast to hit ashore in the Tokyo area late on Saturday and urged people to take precautions to avoid potentially life-threatening danger. Japan's central Pacific coast may see torrential rains beginning on Friday while high waves and tides may cause flooding.", "description": "Japan is bracing for a super typhoon on track to hit central and eastern regions over the three-day weekend with potential damage from torrential rains and strong winds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2529%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_27%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/68dd2220ba50cc6deada18ab60627a2eaeadcf5c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
