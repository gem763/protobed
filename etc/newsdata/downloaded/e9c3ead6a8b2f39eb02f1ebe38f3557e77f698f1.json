To gasps, he claimed the best way to honour the memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.\n\nAnd he continued to deploy the \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d rhetoric that has become a signature of his premiership, claiming: \u201cThe people outside this house understand what is happening \u2026 The leader of the opposition and his party don\u2019t trust the people.\u201d\n\nAnd he added: \u201cInstead of facing the voters the opposition turned tail and fled from an election. Instead of deciding to let the voters decide, they ran for the courts \u2026 it is absolutely no disrespect to the judiciary to say I think the court was wrong.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s appearance led critics to accuse him of failing to show any humility over his supreme court defeat.\n\nResponding to the prime minister, Corbyn accused him of failing to take the supreme court defeat seriously, calling his statement, \u201c10 minutes of bluster from a dangerous prime minister who thinks he is above the law but in truth is not fit for the office he holds\u201d.\n\nLabour\u2019s Jess Phillips said: \u201cI know that the prime minister wants to appear as a strong man. But the strongest thing he could do that would look the best to this country at the moment would be to act with some humility and contrition.\u201d\n\nOther female MPs, including Paula Sherriff, attacked the prime minister for repeatedly calling the act put through parliament by Hilary Benn to take no-deal Brexit off the table the \u201csurrender bill\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe prime minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an act of parliament passed by this house. We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous, inflammatory language for legislation we do not like.\u201d\n\nRecalling the memory of her friend Cox, she said many MPs had received death threats.\n\n\u201cAnd let me tell the prime minister \u2013 they often quote his words, \u2018surrender act\u2019, \u2018betrayal,\u2019 \u2018traitor\u2019: we must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first.\u201d\n\nJohnson replied that he had never heard such \u201chumbug\u201d in all his life. He caused further outrage when telling Labour\u2019s Tracy Brabin, who was elected to Cox\u2019s seat following the MP\u2019s murder by a far-right extremist a week before the EU referendum, that \u201cthe best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to bring this country together is, I think, to get Brexit done\u201d.\n\nCox campaigned for remain. Her widower, Brendan, later wrote on Twitter: \u201cFeel a bit sick at Jo\u2019s name being used in this way. The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, later suggested all MPs, \u201chave a responsibility to be mild in our language when we\u2019re speaking in this house or outside\u201d.\n\nThe exchanges capped a day of dramatic and bad-tempered House of Commons business over Brexit, the likelihood of an election, and the prime minister\u2019s calamitous defeat in the supreme court.\n\nBut after scrambling to return early from the UN general assembly\u2019s meeting in the US, Johnson offered little indication of how the government now intends to proceed, instead challenging Labour or any other opposition party to table a motion of no confidence, and promising to set aside parliamentary time on Thursday for MPs to vote on it.\n\nLabour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats have all insisted they will not seek to bring down the government and trigger a general election until a delay to Brexit is secured. But Downing Street suggested that if Labour fails to table a vote of no confidence it will effectively indicate support for Johnson\u2019s strategy.\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s damning judgment, Corbyn said that Johnson \u201cshould have done the honourable thing and resigned. Yet here he is, forced back to this house to rightfully face scrutiny, without a shred of remorse or humility and no substance whatsoever.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHe says he wants an election. I want an election. If he wants an election, it\u2019s very simple. Get an extension and we\u2019ll have an election.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Gloria de Piero of the cross-party MPs for a deal group called for a compromise, urging the prime minister to publish the potential areas of agreement identified in cross-party talks earlier this year.\n\nJohnson responded sympathetically and said he would try to produce something in the coming days. He is likely to need the support of Labour MPs to have any chance of passing a Brexit deal in time for the 31 October deadline.\n\nDespite the supreme court verdict, the Conservatives intend to press ahead with their party conference in Manchester next week. They have tabled a motion, which will be voted on Thursday morning, asking MPs to support shutting down parliament for three days next week to accommodate it.\n\nA government source said: \u201cI cannot guarantee that there won\u2019t be an impact on the economy of Manchester. The Labour party if they are doing this \u2013 it will be a nakedly political act.\u201d\n\nManchester Central MP Lucy Powell had earlier warned that the cost to the city\u2019s economy if the conference was cancelled could be up to \u00a330m.\n\nLabour sources said they had proposed a compromise plan to the Conservatives of debating legislation on which both sides are in agreement next week, including the domestic abuse bill, allowing many Tory MPs to attend the conference.\n\nThe domestic abuse bill was dropped as a result of prorogation, along with several others. Labour initially believed the plan had been agreed but it was later rejected.\n\nThe Lib Dems have already said they will not support parliament being shut down again. A party source said, \u201cafter Boris Johnson unlawfully suspended parliament to stop us scrutinising, the last thing we\u2019re going to do is give them a three-day Tory jamboree\u201d.\n\nAfter Corbyn\u2019s stinging critique, Johnson hit back with an extended political attack on the leader of the opposition, accusing him of running scared \u2013 to which many Conservative MPs responded with rowdy cheers and an extended round of applause.\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t they allow him to unleash his charms on the electorate? Is it because they are not only terrified that he is going to lose but also even more terrified of the remote possibility that he might win.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t control his own party. He can\u2019t decide whether he is for leave or for remain. He\u2019s being held captive by his colleagues,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson was the fourth minister to address parliament on Wednesday, as MPs took the opportunity to press the government on a series of other issues, including the collapse of travel company Thomas Cook and the situation in Iran.\n\nEarlier, the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who advised the government that an extended suspension of parliament would be lawful according to advice leaked on Wednesday, launched an extraordinary attack on MPs.\n\n\u201cThis parliament is a dead parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on these green benches.\u201d", "description": "Facing MPs after supreme court defeat, Boris Johnson repeats criticism of judgment", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eab13d4d503d9eda02ed4a71a4a4a9b3b209242/0_4_1758_1055/master/1758.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8b850eefcf069815032266c6087426ad", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
