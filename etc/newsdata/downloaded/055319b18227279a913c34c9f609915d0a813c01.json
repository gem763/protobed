And they do it to cover up their own racism and the brutality of communism. These athletes \u2026 I don\u2019t think they fully understand how they\u2019re being manipulated by China and their addiction to that money over there. They\u2019re doing the bidding of the communist regime by constantly attacking and portraying America as unrecoverably racist.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Fox Sports 1 \u201cSpeak For Yourself\u201d co-host Jason Whitlock on Thursday ripped the NBA and Nike for bowing to China\u00a0after the Houston Rockets general manager expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and, as a result, China suspended ties with the league. | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/whitlock-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
