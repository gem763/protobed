Now they want to shut down the area for two years. It's just frustrating because I feel like it's kind of stigmatizing our group.\"\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Maui News, http://www.mauinews.com", "description": "Hawaii has closed access to a cliff face in a nature reserve over concerns that rock-climbing activities are threatening native plant species and modifying the rock face, officials said.
