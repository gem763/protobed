We Asked the Guy Who Photographed Him for Two Decades.", "language": "en", "text": "While they may not always be able recall their birthdate or the hospital where they were born, any Deadhead worth his or her pink Himalayan salt can tell you the exact date and location where they first saw the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia on guitar and vocals.\n\nFor San Francisco-based photographer and filmmaker Jay Blakesberg (who does know his birthday, and turns 58 in a couple of months), that date was September 3, 1977, and the location was Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey.\n\nIn the company of his older sister and 100,000 easygoing strangers, a then-15-year-old Blakesberg took in an epic show that was selected by Dead historian Dick Latvala for the 15th edition of his Dick\u2019s Picks series of archival releases, which also included performances from the New Riders of the Purple Sage and the Marshall Tucker Band.\n\nThe Grateful Dead at Giants Stadium on 09/02/1978 (Jay Blakesberg)\n\nNearly a year later, on September 2 of \u201978, a 16-year-old Blakesberg caught the Dead again, except this time the venue was Giants Stadium. And there was one other difference: he brought along his dad\u2019s camera.\n\nA shot Blakesberg captured at that show (seen above) is one of the images that lead off Jerry Garcia: Secret Space of Dreams, a new book featuring more than 140 color and black-and-white photographs the 57-year-old took from 1978-1995.\n\nThe book, which includes a foreword from John Mayer and quotes from musicians like Bob Dylan, Trey Anastasio, Carlos Santana, Jim James and Garcia\u2019s Grateful Dead bandmates, catches glimpses of Garcia both on- and offstage with members of his band, friends and other musical collaborators.\n\nThe Dead with Carlos Santana on 01/26/93 (Jay Blakesberg)\n\nThough Blakesberg wasn\u2019t a pro when he snapped that first photo of Garcia in \u201978, Dead shows were one of the places he began honing the chops that eventually enabled him to pay his rent taking photographs.\n\n\u201cIn the entire history of the Grateful Dead, everybody was allowed to bring a camera into the show. A professional camera \u2026 unlike every concert you go to today,\u201d Blakesberg tells InsideHook. \u201cAnybody could bring a camera. So for the longest time, I was just a fan with a camera. Then, when I started getting magazine assignments in the late \u201980s, I started shifting and being inside the pit instead of outside the pit. And there were a variety of these assignments that put me face to face with band members.\u201d\n\nThat gig led to more work around the band, to the point that Blakesberg could call up Weir\u2019s office and get on the Dead\u2019s guestlist with backstage passes and tickets whenever he wanted. For the last five years of the original Dead lineup, Garcia\u2019s last on earth, Blakesberg was there \u2014 and so was his camera.\n\nThe Grateful Dead at the UC Berkley Greek Theatre on 05/23/82. (Jay Blakesberg)\n\nAfter gaining some recognition within the scene, Blakesberg got his first job being paid to photograph a Grateful Dead band member in 1990 when he took publicity photos for guitarist Bob Weir for a project he was doing with bass player Rob Wasserman.\n\nRelated:\n\nMeet The NFL\u2019s Resident Deadhead, Romeo Okwara\n\nHow Taylor Welch Amassed the Greatest Collection of Grateful Dead Tees\n\n\u201cPeople think of the Grateful Dead as not having a lot of stage presence, right? Not being very flashy, but they kind of were,\u201d Blakesberg says. \u201cBut you just had to wait for it and know when to look for it. There were these sublime body language flourishes with their hands or their legs or the inflection in their mouths when they were singing intense vocals and stuff like that. Jerry\u2019s smile was a smile that could cut through anything. And so, on stage it was things like that, to me, that made Garcia interesting.\u201d\n\nThe Grateful Dead at the Sam Boyd Silver Bowl on 05/15/93. (Jay Blakesberg)\n\nAway from the bright lights, Garcia was almost a more intriguing subject.\n\n\u201cOffstage, Jerry was very funny and self-deprecating and clever and articulate and smart,\u201d Blakesberg says. \u201cBut Jerry was the unlikely rock star. He didn\u2019t want to be a rock star and he didn\u2019t want to be put on this pedestal. He wanted to be a regular guy. When you were doing photographs of him, it was sort of the same thing. He did not want to be the center of attention, so photoshoots always went very quickly with Jerry. I learned from photographing Jerry Garcia that he hated being photographed.\u201d\n\nThere were other issues that sometimes made taking Garcia\u2019s photo tricky.\n\nJerry Garcia with David Grisman at Grisman\u2019s home on 09/02/93 (Jay Blakesberg)\n\n\u201cOne of my greatest memories is photographing him and David Grisman in Grisman\u2019s living room for the cover of Acoustic Guitar Magazine,\u201d Blakesberg says. \u201cIt was me, the writer, my assistant, Jerry, Grisman, some guitars and a mandolin. They started playing music for us for 45 minutes, our own private concert. I\u2019m trying to shoot them for a magazine cover, so I have to tell Garcia to stop singing, because his mouth is going to be all wonky and he can\u2019t look like that for a magazine cover. So they\u2019re singing, and I\u2019m telling Garcia to hum the lyrics in his head. Who tells Jerry Garcia in a private concert to stop singing, you know? I\u2019m like the only weirdo in the world to have done that one. But that was a pretty special moment.\u201d\n\nIn other cases, the issues that made photographing Garcia a bit difficult weren\u2019t as amusing.\n\n\u201cOne of my last face-to-face shoots with Jerry was in April of \u201995, so just a few months before he died,\u201d Blakesberg says. \u201cThey were making a video for a Jerry Garcia Band song that was on a soundtrack for the movie Smoke with Ashley Judd and Harvey Keitel and William Hurt. It was in this little cafe in North Beach here in San Francisco. I could see Jerry was sweating profusely and his hair was sort of matted to his forehead. And no matter what, they had hair and makeup people like patting it down every minute, he\u2019d still \u2026 you could just tell he just was not looking healthy. But that\u2019s just what it was. It\u2019s not as if I could go out and be like, \u2018Man, I think Jerry needs to go see a doctor.\u2019 It just wasn\u2019t like that. We were just bystanders.\u201d\n\nThe Jerry Garcia Band with Ashley Judd at the making of the \u201cSmoke Gets in Your Eyes\u201d video in San Francisco on 04/17/95 (Jay Blakesberg)\n\nDespite Garcia\u2019s declining health during the mid-\u201990s there wasn\u2019t really a sense things were coming to an end, according to Blakesberg.\n\n\u201cBefore Jerry died in \u201995, shows were erratic and shows were not as great as they could have been or were just a few years earlier,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe we could see a decline in the quality of the musicianship, but we just attributed that to everything else in Grateful Deadland. They\u2019re not rehearsing enough or they\u2019re not playing enough, or who knows what? We were kids, you know? We were 25-to-30 years old when Jerry died. So we didn\u2019t have the same perspective that we might have now as 50-something-year-olds.\u201d\n\nDespite the way that particular chapter of the Grateful Dead story ended, Blakesberg is glad he helped document it and can share it in Secret Space of Dreams.\n\nRobert Hunter and Jerry Garcia at the Grateful Dead office on 01/31/91 (Jay Blakesberg)\n\n\u201cJerry Garcia once said following the Grateful Dead truly is the great American adventure,\u201d Blakesberg says. \u201cAnd we took that to heart and we did that. We went on the great American adventure with the American rock band that had a great American songbook. We lived by those words and traveled by those words and grew to that music and became a family of freaks and misfits. It was the greatest time of our lives. And so, zero regrets. Bittersweet? Sure. Sweet? Absolutely. Beautiful? For sure. Tragic? Absolutely. All of the above, because we watched Jerry decline in front of our eyes. Though we didn\u2019t realize that was happening at the time, it was. But at the same time, we were having a lot of fun and we were grooving to that music and that scene all the time, and we loved every minute of it.\u201d", "description": "San Francisco-based photographer and filmmaker Jay Blakesberg discusses the work and photos in his new book \"Jerry Garcia: Secret Space Of Dreams.\"", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-04-at-3.37.16-PM.png?fit=1200%2C729", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
