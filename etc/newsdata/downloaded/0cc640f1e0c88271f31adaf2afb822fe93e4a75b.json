REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger.\n\nThe Washington Post, which first reported the matter, said the country involved was Ukraine, citing unnamed sources.The House panel\u2019s Democratic chairman, Adam Schiff, charged the Trump administration with blocking a congressional inquiry after receiving a closed-door briefing from the inspector general for U.S. spy agencies.\n\nA source familiar with the matter told Reuters the whistleblower complaint at the center of the dispute alleged \u201cmultiple acts\u201d by Trump, not just a phone call with a foreign leader. The source requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nTrump on Thursday called the Washington Post report \u201cFake News.\u201d\n\nThe dispute is the latest chapter of a power struggle in which the Trump administration has been resisting efforts by Democratic lawmakers investigating the president\u2019s business dealings and actions to obtain documents, records and testimony from White House and senior agency officials.\n\nReuters has not been able to confirm details of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nThe Washington Post said Trump spoke by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a few weeks before the whistleblower complaint was filed.\n\nAsked about the Post report, Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN: \u201cIf what is reported is true, it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the president of the United States said to the president of Ukraine \u2018investigate the corruption in your country that has a bearing on our 2016 election\u2019, isn\u2019t that what he\u2019s supposed to do?\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nA congressional source said senators had not been briefed on the country involved in the whistleblower complaint.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the Washington Post report mentioning Ukraine. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether the White House is directly involved, because we can\u2019t get an answer to that question, but we do know that they are making some claim that a privilege may apply,\u201d Schiff told reporters.\n\nThe dispute erupted after Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson told the committee in a Sept. 9 letter that he had received an Aug. 9 whistleblower complaint that he deemed urgent and credible, the legal threshold requiring its transmission to Congress.\n\nRelated Coverage Schiff says DOJ involved in decision to block whistleblower complaint\n\nBut a Sept. 13 letter to the House panel and the Senate Intelligence Committee asserted that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire - after consulting with the Justice Department - found that the complaint did not meet the legal definition of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Jason Klitenic, general counsel in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, also said the complaint was not subject to disclosure because it did not concern conduct by an intelligence official or an intelligence activity overseen by the DNI, as required by the law.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBecause of the findings, Atkinson was unable to provide details on the complaint in speaking with the committee, lawmakers said.\n\nSchiff said the Justice Department had misinterpreted the law in blocking Maguire from disclosing the complaint.\n\nAnother Democratic member of the committee, Mike Quigley, was more direct, charging that Attorney General William Barr was seeking to protect the president.\n\n\u201cMr. Barr and the Department of Justice\u2019s job in their mind is to protect the president,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t matter if that violates the laws.\u201d\n\nCNN said on Thursday both the White House and Justice Department were involved in advising Maguire not to give Congress a copy of the complaint.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokeswoman for the Justice Department referred to the two letters Atkinson had sent the committee. Maguire\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cVirtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself,\u201d Trump said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cKnowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call,\u201d he said.\n\nSchiff had issued a subpoena to Maguire last week in an attempt to force him to turn over the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nHe said on Thursday the committee could be forced to go to court to seek an order compelling officials to disclose the complaint.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cI hope that the director of national intelligence will reconsider because it\u2019s my understanding that by law he can provide this to us and by law he\u2019s required to provide this to us,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nMaguire is scheduled to testify in public to the panel next week.\n\nA congressional source told Reuters the complaint was filed with the inspector general on Aug. 12.
