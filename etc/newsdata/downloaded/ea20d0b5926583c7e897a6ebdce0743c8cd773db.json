We see victims paying to their assigned wallets; from there it takes an average of two to three transactions before it goes to an \u2018affiliate\u2019 or \u2018distribution\u2019 wallet,\u201d the researchers explain.\n\n\u201cFrom that wallet we see the split happening as the moniker \u2018UNKN\u2019 mentioned in his forum post we started this article with. The 60 or 70 percent stays with the affiliate and the remaining 40/30 percent is forwarded in multiple transactions towards the actors behind Sodinokibi,\u201d they add.\n\nHow does Sodinokibi work?\n\nUnleashed in April this year, Sodinokibi, otherwise known as REvil, is a serious threat.\n\nInitially, the ransomware was seen propagating itself in the wild by exploiting a vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s WebLogic server.\n\nSimilarly to other strains of ransomware, Sodinokibi is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), which sees a group of people maintain the code and another group, known as affiliates, spread the ransomware.\n\nRansomware has increasingly made headlines in recent years after several high-profile attacks. Just last week, The Next Web reported on how healthcare providers were facing an unprecedented level of social engineering-driven malware threats.\n\nIn fact, several hospitals in the US recently gave in to attackers\u2019 demands and paid the requested ransom, most likely in cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not uncommon for organizations to cough up the funds in order to avoid prolonged disruption, sometimes attacks backfire.\n\nLast week we saw how a ransomware victim who paid Bitcoin to unlock his files took vengeance on his attackers, by hacking them right back.\n\n\u201cWe do understand that there are situations in which [company] executives decide to pay the ransom but, by doing that, we keep this business model alive and also fund other criminal markets,\u201d said McAfee\u2018s researchers.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
