Join the conversation below.\n\nThe moment was a tacit acknowledgement that the new NFL season will begin the way the last one ended: with Kraft as one of the most powerful men in football. Which is a turn because, not that long ago, the New England Patriots owner looked like he might be in trouble.\n\nKraft, 78 years old, has long been one of the NFL\u2019s pre-eminent power brokers. Since he bought the Patriots in 1994, the team has been the league\u2019s most successful franchise. Off the field, he has been a pivotal force negotiating major pacts, from the NFL\u2019s lucrative media rights deals to collective bargaining agreements with the players.\n\nBut in February, just weeks after the Patriots owner won the Super Bowl for the sixth time, Kraft\u2019s status was threatened. He was one of 25 men charged in Jupiter, Fla., with prostitution solicitation at Orchids of Asia Day Spa. The incident raised broad questions about his standing within the league.\n\nIn the months since, though, as the case against him has crumbled, those have been resoundingly answered and Kraft\u2019s influence appears undiminished. He has remained one of the leading figures involved in ongoing talks with the NFL Players Association for a new collective bargaining agreement.\n\nHe was also the driving force behind the NFL\u2019s wide-ranging partnership with Jay-Z, which effectively makes the rap icon the face of the league\u2019s social-justice efforts and includes entertainment offerings\u2014including Meek Mill, Kraft\u2019s friend, performing at Thursday\u2019s season-opening game.\n\nKraft preserved his clout by mounting an aggressive fight against the charges. The result: by scoring big wins in court, he maintained his public standing before it ever eroded.\n\nJay-Z, left, with Patriots owner Robert Kraft during a Reform Alliance event in January.

Kraft organized that meeting after he and Jay-Z worked together as founding members of the Reform Alliance, an organization that advocates for systematic reform of the prison system. The group was spurred by the imprisonment of Meek Mill, a rapper whose criminal case became a public rallying cry for needing to overhaul the system.\n\nThe same month Kraft organized that meeting, his personal trouble began. In January, authorities allege that they saw Kraft visit Orchids of Asia on two occasions and pay for sexual acts that were caught on camera. The charges were announced weeks later.\n\nKraft faced two misdemeanor counts, but the situation appeared even more disturbing because of a narrative espoused by authorities. Police and the state attorney described the probe as part of a broader sex trafficking case, and they repeatedly characterized the men who patronized the massage parlors as willing supporters of sex slavery.\n\nBut no one was charged with sex trafficking at Orchids of Asia Day Spa, and more than a month after the charges were announced in a string of high-profile press conferences, prosecutors eventually conceded that there was no human trafficking there.\n\nOver the course of the off-season, a legal firefight ensued and the key evidence against Kraft\u2014the video from inside the spa that allegedly showed him receiving the sex acts\u2014was suppressed, with a judge ruling that authorities illegally obtained the footage. The judge also threw out the traffic stop that identified Kraft, deeming it unlawful.\n\nIt added up to a series of major wins for Kraft, and a crippling blow to the case against him, after his high-powered legal team had argued for weeks that authorities had overstepped their bounds and unfairly tarnished his reputation by publicly associating him with sex trafficking, when it wasn\u2019t present in the case.\n\nStill, the scandal produced uncomfortable headlines for the league and questions about whether or not Goodell would punish the Patriots owner.\n\nMeek Mill, right, stands with Robert Kraft during a Celtics game.

In April, after weeks of keeping a low profile in the scandal\u2019s wake, he emerged as the Celtics took on the Pacers in the NBA playoffs\u2014where the Boston fans greeted him to raucous applause. In June, he took a group of more than a dozen current and former players to Israel, where he was awarded the Genesis Prize for his philanthropy to combat anti-Semitism. He traveled to France where he watched Rafael Nadal win the French Open and the U.S. women win the World Cup.\n\nThroughout the off-season he has also been one of a handful of owners directly involved in negotiations with players to reach a new collective bargaining agreement. Although the current deal has two more seasons on it, Kraft and other owners have hoped to secure a new deal as soon as possible to better position the league in negotiations with its outside partners. People familiar with the negotiations say Kraft is one of the players\u2019 preferred counterparts at the bargaining table.\n\nAny potential punishment from the league against Kraft wouldn\u2019t come until the legal proceedings have finished, the league has said. That could be a while: the state has appealed the ruling that suppressed the key evidence against him, paving the way for the misdemeanor case against him to continue for months more.\n\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "description": "Patriots owner Robert Kraft remains one of the NFL\u2019s pre-eminent power brokers as a case against him for prostitution solicitation crumbles.", "authors": ["Andrew Beaton", "Andrew.Beaton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103294/social"}
