The demand for meat from Asia might cause a ripple effect that could hit American shoppers at the food store.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAfrican swine fever hit China hard in recent months, causing the loss of more than 300 million pigs, representing roughly one-fourth of the world\u2019s pork supply. European and South American markets have stepped in and seen export prices tick up in light of China\u2019s demand as the world\u2019s largest population is desperately importing protein.\n\nAnd with the Wall Street Journal reporting on Monday that China\u2019s expected pork production expected to drop 35.7 billion pounds this year, the American market at some point might go from yelling \"sooie\" to \"owie\" in the supermarket.\n\nAs of now, things have remained relatively calm for most consumers. The cost of bacon is down the past two months and considerably lower than a spike seen at the end of 2017. Pork chops, both center cuts and boneless, are down from July\u2019s prices. There are indicators that this may not last long as the price of ham, however, is up 6.5 percent since last August.\n\nIt all spells something to watch for consumers and the effect of pork prices might also hit other meat products as well. Ground chuck is up 7.5 percent over last year, pointing toward greater demand at the meat aisle. Per the Journal, China\u2019s imports aren\u2019t just limited to pork. The country\u2019s import of \u201cchicken, beef and sheep meat jumped nearly 70%, totaling more than $5 billion in value\u201d from May through July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn search of alternatives, one area that could be poised to see growth at the supermarket is the plant-based meat market.
