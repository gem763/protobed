I have bitten back at a few people, when people say negative comments on my own stuff, I\u2019ll say something back and block them.

Other people judge people who they don\u2019t know, but I know who she is. Honestly you couldn\u2019t meet anyone nicer, you\u2019d walk away thinking \u201cshe\u2019s the nicest girl I\u2019ve ever met!\u201d She\u2019s got a heart of gold and she wouldn\u2019t say boo to a goose.\n\n'She\u2019s got time for everyone and that\u2019s the most frustrating thing.
