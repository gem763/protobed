Uber Wallet, which will reportedly roll out to the Uber Driver app in the next few weeks before becoming available on the Uber and Uber Eats apps in 2020, will allow users to see their earning and spending history, view Uber's financial products, and store and manage their money.\n\nUber is reintroducing the Uber Credit Card with new rewards centered around Uber Cash. The card, which consumers can apply for now, is offered in partnership with Barclays and provides 5% back in Uber Cash for purchases from Uber services, 3% back in Uber Cash for hotel, airfare, and restaurant purchases, and 1% Uber Cash back for all other purchases. For context, Uber Cash was launched in September 2018, can be used to pay for Uber services, and can be purchased directly or earned via rewards.\n\nIt's updating its Uber Debit Account for drivers, giving them real-time access to their earnings, and refreshing the Uber Debit Card as well. Uber is adding access to its Uber Debit Account to the Uber Driver app and offering drivers the ability to receive their earnings after each trip they make. And the Uber Visa Debit Card, which is targeted at drivers, now provides cash back for purchases from Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Jiffy Lube, and Advance Auto Parts, all of which may be relevant to purchases drivers are already making.\n\nDebuting Uber Money makes Uber the latest tech company to move into financial services. It joins the ranks of tech companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon and ride-hailing companies like Grab and Gojek that have made significant payment plays.\n\nThese companies' key advantages in financial services are their established user bases and variety of services, which they can leverage to convince consumers to use their payment options. So, Uber will need to effectively leverage its 99 million monthly active platform users, along with its ride-hailing and food-ordering services, to ensure the venture succeeds.\n\nBecause Uber records a huge amount of card volume, its financial services could both prove lucrative and help it cut costs. The company saw $43.5 billion in card volume in 2018, giving it a clear opportunity to capture new revenue from noncash payments through its financial services. Additionally, its high card volume likely means Uber faces significant credit card processing fees, so its new offerings could help limit those and improve the company's overall performance.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
