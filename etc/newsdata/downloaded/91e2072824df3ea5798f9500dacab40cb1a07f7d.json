(Mohamed Azakir/Reuters)\n\nLebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced on Tuesday that he would submit his resignation to the country\u2019s president after more than two weeks of anti-government protests engulfed the nation.\n\n\u201cWe have reached a deadlock and we need a shock in order to brave through the crisis,\u201d Hariri said in a televised statement. \u201cThis is in response to the will and demand of the thousands of Lebanese demanding change.\u201d\n\nThe protests were sparked after the government announced a tax on phone calls made via messaging app WhatsApp. Hundreds of thousands of citizens eventually took to the streets in Beirut, effectively placing the city on lockdown, to protest against government corruption.\n\nDemonstrators have called on government officials to step down, chanting \u201cAll of them means all of them!\u201d\n\n\u201cCorruption is everywhere and in everything,\u201d Paula Yacoubian, the only member of the Lebanese parliament who doesn\u2019t belong to a political party, told the New York Times. \u201cCorruption is when you look at the rivers, just a black smelly sewer. Corruption is 220 kilometers of shores where you cannot swim because of pollution.\u201d\n\nLebanon has been unable to provide basic services such as 24-hour electricity and garbage disposal because of the demonstrations.\n\nHassan Nasrallah, the leader of the terrorist group and Lebanese political party Hezbollah, warned last week that dissolving the government could plunge the country into another civil war. The Lebanese Civil War lasted from 1975 to 1990. Nasrallah also alleged on Saturday that foreign countries may be responsible for whipping up demonstrations.\n\nRiot police have had to keep supporters of Hezbollah from clashing with protesters. On Tuesday, Hezbollah supporters attacked a protest camp set up by anti-government demonstrators, burning or dismantling demonstrators\u2019 tents.", "description": "Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced on Tuesday that he would submit his resignation to the country's president.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
