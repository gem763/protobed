And experts say sports betting\u2019s impact would be minimal.\n\nState lawmakers are studying the potential for economic benefits with expanded gambling. Adding horse racing or casino gambling in the state would require Georgians to approve a constitutional amendment allowing the expansion.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp has said that he opposes casino gambling, but would not stand in the way of putting an amendment before voters as long as it guarantees the revenue will benefit the HOPE program.\n\nSupporters say an expansion of gambling would bring thousands of jobs and pump hundreds of millions of dollars into the Georgia Lottery-funded HOPE scholarship.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s relative isolation from other gambling and other factors make a valid case for expanding the industry, said Jennifer Roberts, associate director of the International Center for Gaming Regulation at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and a gaming law expert who has represented major hotel chains.\n\n\u201cIn general, gambling does bring economic benefit to states,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut any form of gambling is a policy decision for each state. Policymakers have to decide what the smartest approach is for their state.\u201d\n\nBut some conservative and religious groups oppose expanding gambling because they say it\u2019s an immoral and addictive habit that foments crime. Others have questioned the revenue predictions offered by proponents, especially as more states expand gambling and compete for customers.\n\nState Rep. Wes Cantrell, a Republican from Woodstock, is a pastor and has been an outspoken opponent of expanding gambling in Georgia. He said Georgia should require the Georgia Lottery Corp. to use 35% of its revenue for education. State law says education programs should get as close to \u201cas practical\u201d 35% of lottery ticket sale money.\n\n\u201cThe long-term stability of the HOPE scholarship would not be in question if the Georgia Lottery Corp. had not been allowed to break the law consistently since 1997,\u201d Cantrell said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, http://www.ajc.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Georgia state lawmakers again are exploring the idea of new legalized gambling to help fund the HOPE scholarship program.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
