He was living in the U.K. in 2012 when he entered the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested asylum rather than surrendering to authorities and risking extradition to the U.S., where his WikiLeaks website was under investigation for publishing classified military and diplomatic material.\n\nEcuador ejected Assange from the embassy in April, and he was promptly jailed in connection with a warrant issued by U.S. authorities. The Justice Department subsequently charged him with several counts related to running WikiLeaks, and a British judge recently ruled that he must remain incarcerated in the U.K. pending an extradition trial scheduled to start in London next year.\n\nMs. Anderson has been a vocal supporter of Assange for several years, and she previously asked Mr. Morrison to intervene in the situation last November.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of mates who have asked me if they can be my special envoy to sort the issue out with Pamela Anderson,\u201d Mr. Morrison responded later that month, prompting the former \u201cPlayboy\u201d model to condemn his comments at the time as \u201csmutty\u201d and \u201cunnecessary.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Ms. Anderson said last month that both the Australian and British governments are being \u201csubservient\u201d to the U.S. by keeping Assange in custody.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged Assange with conspiracy to commit computer hacking and multiple violations of the U.S. Espionage Act over his solicitation and publication of sensitive State and Defense Department material released online by WikiLeaks. He has asserted that he acted as a journalist and is fighting extradition.\n\nMr. Morrison\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
