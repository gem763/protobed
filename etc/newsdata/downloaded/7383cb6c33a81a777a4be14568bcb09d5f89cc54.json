As soon as we got the first one, I knew it was game on and thankfully we ended up at the end nicking a point.\n\n'I have been there myself in moments when things have not been going great. Big clubs' fans expect result after result and for us to come here, they started well and it settled the crowd down but then it was for us to react, turnaround and not accept that we are going to roll over.\n\n'We hit them on the break a few times and in the end we took a point which, given the tough run of games we've got, is a very good point.'", "description": "The winger was flying forward on the counter-attack in the closing stages of Sunday's 2-2 Premier League draw only to be taken out by Gunners midfielder Matteo Guendouzi.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20274212-0-image-a-50_1572257819030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
