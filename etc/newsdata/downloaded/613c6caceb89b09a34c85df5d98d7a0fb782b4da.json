I know I should have said no when Child A went to kiss me.\n\n'I did not know what to do as I had not been kissed before and it happened so quickly.'\n\nThe pupil had also sent Williams a picture of his genitals.\n\nIn a written statement, he said he was not forced by Williams into the inappropriate liaison and that he did not wish to take action against her, according to Wales News.\n\nThe boy said: 'I didn't speak to anyone about what happened.\n\n'I later received a messaged from Shelley Williams in which she said sorry and then she blocked me from social media.'\n\nPolice investigated but ruled out pursuing any criminal proceedings against Williams.\n\nWilliams' father said police brushed off the encounters, describing the teaching assistant as 'naive and vulnerable' and the juvenile as 'a randy teenage boy chancing his arm'.\n\nThe Education Workforce Council concluded that Williams' 'behaviour fell short of the standard expected of a registered person' and has suspended her from the register for six months.", "description": "Shelley Williams, 20, sent the pupil 'sexual' messages when working as a supply teacher in Gwent, South Wales, the Education Workforce Council (headquarters pictured) heard", "authors": ["Mailonline Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/15/20137678-0-image-a-8_1571928689992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
