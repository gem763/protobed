Indeed, maybe if the Russians \u2014 our geopolitical foes in the Middle East and elsewhere \u2014 are cheering on Gabbard\u2019s views, we should perhaps approach her stances with more skepticism. But behind Clinton\u2019s accusation, there is a dangerous conflation taking place between a candidate drawing support from bad actors and actually working with those bad actors. Using the term \u201casset\u201d is a way to seemingly criminalize the uncriminal, and it\u2019s wrong.\n\nI was heavily critical of President Obama\u2019s crowning foreign policy achievement, the Iran deal. Although the mullahs were quite pleased to have sanctions lifted and the Iranian economy grew by 10 percent in 2016 as a consequence, I never once accused Obama of being an \u201cIranian asset.\u201d I would have been laughed out of political circles and rightfully so.\n\nBaseless accusations such as these, designed to put candidates on the perpetual defensive, suck up political oxygen. They unapologetically distract a candidate from discussing policy issues as he or she scrambles to combat unfounded narratives.", "description": "", "authors": ["Erielle Davidson", "Thefederalist.Com If-Everyone-Is-A-Russian-Asset-No-One-Is-A-Russian-Asset"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
