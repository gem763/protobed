We think that for just the investment opportunity in Europe and Israel\u2026 these are good sized funds to raise and then return and make good multiples on,\u201d she tells TechCrunch. \u201cIf you go back in the history of our fundraising we\u2019re always somewhere between $200M-$300M. And that\u2019s the size we like to keep.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course we do think there\u2019s great opportunities in Europe and Israel but not significantly different than we\u2019ve thought over the last 15 years or so,\u201d she adds.\n\n83North has made around 70 investments to date \u2014 which means its five partners are usually making just one investment apiece per year.\n\nThe fund typically invests around $1M at the seed level; between $4M-$8M at the Series A level and up to $20M for Series B, with Bowden saying around a quarter of its investments go into seed (primarily into startups out of Israel); ~40% into Series A; and ~30% Series B.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat evenly mixed between seed, Series A, Series B \u2014 but Series A is probably bigger than everything,\u201d she adds.\n\nIt invests roughly half and half in its two regions of focus.\n\nThe firm has had 15 exits of portfolio companies (three of which it claims as unicorns). Recent multi-billion dollar exits for Bowden are: Just Eat, Hybris (acquired by SAP), iZettle (acquired by PayPal) and Qlik.\n\nWhile 83North has a pretty broad investment canvas, it\u2019s open to new areas \u2014 moving into IoT (with recent investments in Wiliot and VDOO), and also taking what it couches as a \u201cgrowing interest\u201d in healthtech and vertical SaaS.\n\n\u201cSome of my colleagues\u2026 are looking at areas like lidar, in-vehicle automation, looking at some of the drone technologies, looking at some even healthtech AI,\u201d says Bowden. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at a couple of those in Europe as well. I\u2019ve looked, actually, at some healthtech AI. I haven\u2019t done anything but looked.\n\n\u201cAnd also all things related to data. Of course the market evolves and the technology evolves but we\u2019ve done things related to BI to process automation through to just management of data ops, management of data. We always look at that area. And think we\u2019ll carry on for a number of years. \u201d\n\n\u201cIn venture you have to expand,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou can\u2019t just stay investing in exactly the same things but it\u2019s more small additional add-ons as the market evolves, as opposed to fundamental shifts of investment thesis.\u201d\n\nDiscussing startup valuations, Bowden says European startups are not insulated from wider investment dynamics that have been pushing startup valuations higher \u2014 and even, arguably, warping the market \u2014 as a consequence of more capital being raised generally (not only at the end of the pipe).\n\n\u201cDefinitely valuations are getting pushed up,\u201d she says. \u201cDefinitely things are getting more competitive but that comes back to exactly why we\u2019re focused on raising smaller funds. Because we just think then we have less pressure to invest if we feel that valuations have got too high or there\u2019s just a level\u2026 where startups just feel the inclination to raise way more money than they probably need \u2014 and that\u2019s a big reason why we like to keep our fund size relatively small.\u201d", "description": "83North has closed its fifth fund, completing an oversubscribed $300 million raise and bringing its total capital under management to $1.1BN+.
