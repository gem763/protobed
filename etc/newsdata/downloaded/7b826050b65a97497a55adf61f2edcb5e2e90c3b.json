Just 63 will be made and they've already got buyers who were contacted behind closed doors by Lamborghini before the vehicle was officially announced this week.\n\nWhile the extreme styling might make it appear like an all-new model, it is in fact a rebodied and re-tuned version of the existing Aventador.\n\nHowever, the name Sian, which translates to 'flash of lightning' in Italy's Bolognese dialect, indicates that the car has, for the first time, an electric power source.\n\nOfficially, it is being dubbed the Italian firm's first hybrid model.\n\nThat said, it's not like the system used in a Toyota Prius, for example, which has an electric motor that takes its charge from an onboard lithium-ion battery.\n\nInstead, the Sian uses a supercapacitor, which the brand claims is three times lighter and also thrice as powerful as a battery of the same weight.\n\nJust 63 Sians will be made and they've already got buyers who were contacted behind closed doors by Lamborghini before the vehicle was officially announced\n\nThe name Sian translates to 'flash of lightning' in Italy's Bolognese dialect, indicating the car's part-electrified heart\n\nIt uses a tuned version of the 6.5-litre V12 engine from the flagship Aventador producing 774bhp and adds a 48-volt electric motor for an additional 34bhp boost of grunt\n\nLike other 'mild hybrid' models you can already buy on the market from mainstream brands, the electric motor has been incorporated into the gearbox.\n\nHowever, it's the first example of a low-voltage hybrid system that directly connects the electric motor to the wheels - though it functions only during very low-speed manoeuvres.\n\nIt's not known what the eco benefits are of the system, as Lambo says 'fuel consumption and emissions data is in the type approval stage', though we don't imagine we'll see one being used as an Uber anytime soon.\n\nOther performance upgrades installed include a set of titanium intake valves for the V12 motor, a reconfigured ECU and new exhaust system.\n\nThe combined output of the two power sources of 808bhp makes this the most powerful road car Lamborghini has ever produced\n\nHitting 62mph from a standing start and being able to travel at speeds in excess of 217mph, it will also be the quickest Lambo ever made for the road\n\nWhile the extreme styling might make it appear like an all-new model, it is in fact a rebodied and re-tuned version of the existing Aventador\n\nAs a result, not only is it the most powerful Lamborghini ever produced - almost eight times as potent as a 118bhp Prius - but also, unsurprisingly, the quickest.\n\nThe startling specification claims it will hit 62mph from a standing start in a mere 2.8 seconds and the hyper-hybrid vehicle has a top speed that will be 'over 217mph', according to the company's official documentation.\n\nWhile the powertrain might look to the future, the styling is very much harking back to the past - and the glory days of Lamborghini's stardom.\n\nBosses say the design is inspired by the iconic Countach - arguably one of the brand's most recognised and appreciated models of all time.\n\nThe Y-shaped air inlets, glass engine cover and bonnet style have all be lifted from the classic, while the lights back and front closely replicate those of the all-electric Terzo Millenio concept we saw way back in November 2017.\n\nWhile the powertrain might look to the future, the Sian's styling is very much harking back to the past...\n\nThe Y-shaped air inlets, glass engine cover and bonnet style are all cues taken from the iconic Lamborghini Countach\n\nThe Y-shape headlights closely replicate those of the all-electric Terzo Millenio concept (pictured) we saw way back in November 2017\n\nStefano Domenicali, Lamborghini\u2019s chairman and chief executive, described the car as a 'masterpiece in possibilities'.\n\nHe added: 'Not only does the Si\u00e1n deliver a formidable hyper-car design and engineering tour de force today, it augments the potential for Lamborghini as a super sports car brand for tomorrow and for decades to come, even as hybridisation becomes more desirable and inevitably essential.\n\n'The Lamborghini Si\u00e1n represents the first step in Lamborghini\u2019s route to electrification, and expedites our next-generation V12 engine.\n\n'Its Si\u00e1n moniker, meaning \u2018flash or lightning\u2019 in Bolognese dialect, denotes the first electrification of a Lamborghini production car and confirms our strong connection to the territory in which we operate.\n\n'With the Si\u00e1n, Automobili Lamborghini demonstrates its dynastic strength as a legendary super sports car brand for the future.'\n\nLike other 'mild hybrid' models you can already buy on today's market, the electric motor has been fitted to the gearbox\n\nInside, it's a feast of carbon fibre and high-resolution TFT screens displaying all the necessary information. Lamborghini's famed fighter-jet-style ignition switch - which has a safety cover that needs to be lifted - has been retained\n\nThe electric motor can send power directly to the wheels but only functions during very low-speed manoeuvres\n\nEach of the 63 examples produced will be unique and customised by the well-heeled owners.\n\nIt will be pricier than the most expensive 'production' Lamborghini (meaning not a one-off creation) to date, the SVJ, demanding a fee of over \u00a33million per car.\n\nThis electric gold model used for the official reveal will also take centre stage at the Frankfurt Motor Show, which begins on 12 September.\n\nIt's not known what the eco benefits are of the system, as Lambo says 'fuel consumption and emissions data is in the type approval stage'. Don't expect to see one being used as an Uber anytime soon\n\nEach of the 63 examples produced will be unique and customised by the well-heeled owner", "description": "The limited edition Sian, estimated to cost in the region of \u00a33m, uses a 6.5-litre V12 engine and adds a 48-volt electric motor for an additional 34bhp of grunt to make it the most potent Lambo ever.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
