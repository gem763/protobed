In May, Trump told US diplomats to coordinate with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani says publicly that he is investigating whether Ukraine colluded with the Democrats in the 2016 election, and also is looking into Democrat Joe Biden \u2014 who could face Trump in the 2020 election \u2014 over Biden\u2019s son\u2019s ties to a Ukraine energy company Burisma.\n\nIn September, a whistleblower complaint came to light alleging that, in a July 25 phone call, Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate both cases. The whistleblower expressed concern that \u201cthe president had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a US person for the purposes of advancing his own reelection bid in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe White House-edited transcript of the call shows Trump responding to Zelensky\u2019s request for military aid \u2014 which Trump had frozen days earlier \u2014 by saying: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d\n\nTrump asks Zelensky to get information regarding the alleged help for the Democrats in 2016 and regarding the Bidens. \u201cA lot of people want to find out about that,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cSo if you can, look into it.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Text messages add evidence \u2013\n\nThe inquiry has found text messages between US diplomats showing awareness of what Trump and Giuliani sought.\n\nA week before the Zelensky call, Kurt Volker, the special representative on Ukraine, texted two other diplomats: \u201cMost impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation.\u201d\n\nHours before the call, Volker told Zelensky aide Andrey Yermak: \u201cHeard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate/\u2019get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck!\u201d\n\nOn August 13, Volker texted a draft of a Ukraine statement to his colleagues that said: \u201cWe intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 US elections.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Testimonies bare worries over Trump \u2013\n\nThe White House has refused House demands to provide documents related to the Ukraine dealings. But nine officials have testified to the inquiry behind closed doors.\n\nFormer White House Russia expert Fiona Hill told the inquiry that her boss, Trump\u2019s then-national security advisor John Bolton, was alarmed by the efforts to pressure Ukraine and branded it a surreptitious \u201cdrug deal.\u201d\n\nBolton also said that Giuliani is \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everyone up,\u201d she testified.\n\nOn Thursday, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told the inquiry in written testimony that Trump ordered diplomats in May to work with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani \u201cspecifically mentioned the 2016 election (including the DNC server) and Burisma as two anti-corruption investigatory topics of importance for the President,\u201d Sondland said.\n\n\u2013 Mulvaney admits quid pro quo \u2013\n\nOne Thursday, Trump\u2019s chief of staff Mick Mulvaney stunningly admitted that there was indeed a quid pro quo: that the White House held up aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate whether the country had helped Democrats in 2016.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nTwo hours later Mulvaney retracted his statement, but the damage was done.\n\n\u201cThings just went from very, very bad to much, much worse,\u201d said Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u2013 What next \u2013\n\nSchiff said this week there are \u201ca great many\u201d interviews to come, but they are aware of the need to move quickly. Once finished, they will release the interview transcripts and then draw up articles of impeachment \u2014 formal legal charges against the president.\n\nThat could happen as early as late November. The Democrat-controlled House is then expected to quickly vote to approve them. Then Trump would stand trial for removal in the Senate, which, according to one senator, could take place in December.\n\nBut convicting Trump could be difficult, because it would require two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 In just three weeks, the official impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump has accumulated significant testimony and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/e6251c_democrats-in-us-house-representatives-are-building-case-produce-multiple-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
