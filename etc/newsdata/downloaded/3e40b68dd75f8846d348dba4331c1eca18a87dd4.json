And the reality is that Brody\u2019s been talking about your sex life on his podcast for years.\u201d\n\nWhen cheating rumours started after their highly publicised divorce, Miley took to Twitter to allege that she never cheated on her Aussie boo.\n\n\u201cI can accept that the life I\u2019ve chosen means I must live completely open and transparent with my fans who I love, and the public, 100% of the time,\u201d she tweeted.\n\n\u201cWhat I cannot accept is being told I\u2019m lying to cover up a crime I haven\u2019t committed. I have nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nThough Cyrus acknowledged that she\u2019s cheated in previous relationships, she insisted that she has always been faithful to Hemsworth.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, once Liam & I reconciled, I meant it, & I was committed. There are NO secrets to uncover here,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating. Liam and I have been together for a decade. I\u2019ve said it before & it remains true, I love Liam and always will.\u201d\n\nSad times, mates.", "description": "The Hills: New Beginnings star Spencer Pratt just revealed some spicy details about Miley Cyrus cheating on Liam Hemsworth with Kaitlynn Carter.", "authors": ["Matt Galea"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/SOCIAL-Miley-Liam-VF.jpg"}
