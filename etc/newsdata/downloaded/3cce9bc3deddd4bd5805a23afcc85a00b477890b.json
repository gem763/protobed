(The band is responsible for one of NPR Music's best albums of 2018 and one of our favorite songs of 2015; we also included \"Tibetan Pop Stars\" on the 200 Greatest Songs By 21st Century Women.)\n\nYouTube\n\nToday, Quinlan announces her debut solo album, Likewise, recorded over the course of a year with Hop Along bandmate Joe Reinhart. While Hop Along started out as a solo project, Likewise \u2014 due out Jan. 31 \u2014 is Quinlan's first album under her own name.\n\n\"Rare Thing,\" the adventurous first single from Likewise, explores a dream Quinlan had about her niece, an infant at the time. \"My love, in the dream / you were already speaking,\" the song opens. Quinlan's songs often excel at encompassing multiple perspectives; in \"Rare Thing\" she quickly changes course: \"Come to think of it,\" she sings later, \"the dream / was a nightmare.\" But dream or nightmare, at the center of the song remains a complicated kind of tenderness: \"I know there is / love that doesn't have to do with / taking something / from somebody.\" She repeats the line throughout the song, winding her voice around the words a little differently each time, as if trying to unravel what it means to care for yourself and others with generosity.\n\nLikewise is out Jan. 31 via Saddle Creek.", "description": "Likewise comes out Jan. 31.
