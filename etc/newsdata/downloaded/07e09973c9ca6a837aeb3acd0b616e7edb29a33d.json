When it does, we need to demand a Green New Deal | Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler", "language": "en", "text": "American carnage and Brexit collapse, detention camps and environmental breakdown \u2013 the daily barrage of bad news makes it easy to forget that these are disparate symptoms of the same disease unleashed by the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nFacebook Libra must meet strict standards, warns Bank of England Read more\n\nBack then, activists in Europe and the US pushed for a holistic cure: a Green New Deal to deliver necessary investments in people and planet. But establishment economists waved them off, preferring a shot-in-the-arm of easy money. Now, all the grave symptoms of recession have returned \u2013 and the old drugs don\u2019t work any more, antibiotics to which the disease has already adapted.\n\nBut now is not the time for I-told-you-so. Never before has so much idle cash accumulated as in the past decade \u2013 and never before has circulating capital failed so miserably to invest in human health and habitat. We are long overdue for a Green New Deal.\n\nBack in 2008, commentators were quick to announce the death of financialized capitalism. Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, was trotted out in front of Congress to apologise for his faith in self-regulating financial markets. Activists occupied town squares from Oakland to Madrid. And even the CEO of Goldman Sachs admitted he had a \u201creason to regret\u201d. It seemed like radical change was around the corner.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t. Far from collapsing, banks like Goldman Sachs turned around to record profits, hand out record bonuses, and rehash the risky practices had produced the Great Recession.\n\nMortgage debt \u2013 the proximate cause of the Wall Street collapse \u2013 is now at levels higher than in the pre-crisis period. The stock of BBB-rated bonds in Europe and the United States has quadrupled since 2008. Public debt has ballooned. And collateralised loan obligations, or CLOs, have surged to $3tn, \u201creminiscent of the steep rise in collateralized debt obligations that amplified the sub-prime crisis\u201d, according to the Bank of International Settlements.\n\nHow did this happen? How did the financiers succeed in snatching such riches out of the jaws of their bankruptcy? How did the most severe economic downturn in a century result in a broad preservation of a broken status quo?\n\nBy a combination of carrots, sticks and tricks.\n\nThe first two ingredients are well known. The banks, of course, got their carrots. Governments in the US and the EU bailed out their bankrupt private lenders, shifting the mass of their debt on to the public balance sheets.\n\nThe public would then get the stick. Instead of punishing the irresponsible architects of the crash, our governments punished the pensioners, the poor and anyone who rose up to challenge the regressive cuts they imposed.\n\nLess well known are the tricks deployed by governments and their central banks to stabilize the financial system and stave off the growing demand for fiscal stimulus.\n\nAmong many \u2013 swaps, exchanges, special vehicles purposes \u2013 quantitative easing was the most impressive, and the most poisonous.\n\nTo understand how it worked, recall that banks hate one thing more than bank robbers: assets on their books that they cannot lend with interest. After the 2008 collapse, with investment dead in the water, the central banks had pushed interest rates to near, or sometimes below, zero \u2013 hoping to kickstart investment. But this drove bankers up the wall, since they could not charge interest to lend their assets.\n\nTo help them along, the central banks bought trillions of these assets from the banks, using freshly minted cash. One knew that things got silly when the Bank of England bought IOUs issued by McDonald\u2019s.\n\nOn the surface, the tricks worked. The influx of central bank money ended the recession, shrank unemployment, even revived the United States\u2019 gargantuan trade deficit to its pre-2008 levels. Business-as-usual regained its dominance, and banks were declared safe again.\n\nNations must unite to halt global economic slowdown, says new IMF head Read more\n\nUnder the surface, however, the crisis was deepening. The easy-lending environment created by quantitive easing and rate cuts \u2013 far from raising wages and sparking new startups \u2013 encouraged corporations to buy back their own shares, deliver more money to their wealthy shareholders, and load up on debts in the process. In 2018, buybacks soared to a record-high $806bn, a 55% increase from the year before. According to a recent study by the Bank of England, the overall effect of quantitive easing was to increase the wealth of the bottom 10% in the UK by roughly \u00a33,000, and that of the top 10% by \u00a3350,000.\n\nMeanwhile, investment in the real economy has plummeted. In the US, public investment dropped to 1.4% of GDP, its lowest level in 75 years. In the eurozone, net public investment has remained near zero for nearly a decade, with infrastructure investment in southern European countries over 30% lower than it was pre-crisis. And with the state on the sideline, the planet warmed, the environment collapsed, and species after species moved toward extinction.\n\nNow, we are heading back into recession \u2013 but the old tricks don\u2019t work any more. Rates have been cut, liquidity has been pumped, and the economy remains at a stall. Central banks are simply \u201cpushing on a string\u201d, as the former Fed governor Marriner Eccles once said.\n\nIf 2008 saw the original development of the Green New Deal proposal, then, 2019 is the time to deploy it: a moment when the architects of the old strategy, pockets empty, no longer seem able to defend it. \u201cThere was unanimity,\u201d said Mario Draghi, retiring president of the ECB, \u201cthat fiscal policy should become the main instrument.\u201d\n\nBut fool me twice, shame on me. Having squandered the last crisis, we cannot fall again for Draghi\u2019s promise of a mild Keynesian stimulus in the face of human extinction. Instead, we must mobilize behind the Green New Deal as the only reasonable response to the coming recession.\n\nIt is tempting to think of the present moment as a crossroads: we either get our Green New Deal, or we descend into eco-fascism. But the fallout from the last recession suggests that \u2013 if we do not articulate a shared demand \u2013 we might just as easily get a slightly reconfigured version of the status quo: a little more green around the edges, sure, but with roughly the same distribution of power and resources. Such a plan is already under way in Europe, where the European commission now calls for a \u201cgreen deal\u201d with none of the transformative content of the Green New Deal agenda.\n\nWith the climate strikers marching on their front feet \u2013 and the old guard caught retreating on its heels \u2013 we have a clear opportunity to achieve a true systems change. But it will require us to make clear to our governments: it is a Green New Deal or bust.", "description": "Having squandered the last financial crisis, we cannot make the same mistakes again.
