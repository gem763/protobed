It accuses the British government of investing vast sums in carbon-intensive projects that are inconsistent with its stated environmental aims.\n\nThe group says it wants non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to cut carbon emissions and avert a climate crisis it says will bring starvation and social collapse.\n\nThe group disrupted London with 11 days of protests in April that cast it as the biggest act of civil disobedience in recent British history.", "description": "The mural showed the group's logo surrounded by various animals, including several birds of paradise and a snake", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/15/06/1000x563_cmsv2_aba04fa3-4f13-52a5-8c72-65edef83e050-4211506.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
