Well, the couple established some solid couple goals by dating for six years and then finally taking the plunge and marrying in Italy last year.\n\nIn these six years of courtship, Ranveer and Deepika managed to strike correct work-life balance but never lived in together. Was their any specific reason that they didn't live together? Talking to Harper Bazaar, Deepika was asked about why the couple decided not to stay together before tying the knot.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere was a lot of temptation to move away from the traditional, especially for the two of us, who are constantly travelling, but it was important to me.\"\n\nShe further added that it wasn't just about them but their parents' happiness also mattered a lot to them. She said,\n\n\"Ranveer has always been okay with whatever. He\u2019s always said, \u2018Whatever makes you happy makes me happy.\u2019 But for me, it\u2019s about wanting to do everything at the right time. It\u2019s how I saw my parents do it, so I didn\u2019t know any other way.\"\n\nAn old-school by heart, Deepika also said that living together before marriage would have killed the excitement of it all. She said,\n\n\u201cIf we had started living together earlier, then what would we be discovering later on? That\u2019s what this year has been\u2014living together and discovering each other. I like to say we made the best decision of our lives. I know people are cynical about marriage, but that hasn\u2019t been our experience. We believe in the institution, and we\u2019re enjoying every bit of it.\"\n\nDon't Miss 144 SHARES 2.4 K SHARES 440 SHARES 893 SHARES 25.6 K SHARES\n\nRanveer Singh and Deepika Padukone will next be seen in Kabir Khan's 83.", "description": "Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh are just one month away from their first marriage anniversary and several speculations around their wedding has already began.
