Russell was a breakout star for the Brooklyn Nets last season, and with the team in the running for Kevin Durant, he apparently could feel a shift when a potential trade began to materialize.\n\nSpeaking this week, Russell said that he never knew for certain that Brooklyn was looking to send him to the West Coast, but that he had a feeling when interpersonal relationships started to change in tone as the season wound down.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nVia Twitter:\n\nAs the Warriors season gets started, D'Angelo Russell (@Dloading) looks back with @TermineRadio and @GregAnthony50 on how he ended up with Golden State#DubNation pic.twitter.com/bcxXauGt0L \u2014 SiriusXM NBA Radio (@SiriusXMNBA) October 28, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou see the same players, you see the same coaches, you see the same trainers every day, so when they start to act a little different, you\u2019ll recognize it. You know that. I could feel it, and I just kind of played the professional route. [I] came in, got my work in every day, and just controlled what I could control.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Warriors are going to struggle this season, but it won\u2019t be due to Russell. The team is exceptionally thin, and it doesn\u2019t look like they have the talent required to run the same kind of defensive schemes they have in the past when their stars are out of the game.\n\nSteve Kerr will try to stagger his lineups so he has some kind of organizational consistency, but Golden State will need all they can get from Russell. At this juncture, it\u2019s probably best for all parties that the split was made given that Russell has a chance to shine and the Nets got an all-time great in Durant.", "description": "Russell said that he never knew for certain that Brooklyn was looking to send him to the West Coast.", "authors": ["Dane Delgado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_vGOA0t_ISxDwRWdWCxNAw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7Dajv_cJo0qu22J.204Gew--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/9e11307c0d6c6ae702c0a237f8d557dd", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
