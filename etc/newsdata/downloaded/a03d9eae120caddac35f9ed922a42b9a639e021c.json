Snappy green beans, also readily available in late summer, round out this unassuming, but impressive pasta you\u2019ll want to make again and again no matter what the season.", "description": "Celery, an underappreciated vegetable relegated to making stocks and mirepoix, rarely gets the attention it deserves It\u2019s available in the grocery store year-round Come late summer, it starts popping up in farmers' markets everywhere, and it deserves to shine", "authors": ["Colu Henry", "Nancy Harmon Jenkins", "Pierre Franey", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Marian Burros", "Florence Fabricant", "Melissa Clark", "Regina Schrambling", "Sarah Digregorio", "Julia Moskin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/dining/CH-pasta-with-green-beans-horizontal/merlin_143375034_7e70da66-c904-430a-89c7-2d9dd42eee5d-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-11"}
