That breach was not revealed until March 2018.\n\nIn their 414-page complaint, users said Facebook misled them into thinking they could keep control over personal data, when in fact it let thousands of \"preferred\" outsiders such as Airbnb, Lyft (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) gain access.\n\nChhabria faulted Facebook for treating privacy as an \"all-or-nothing\" proposition, where users would forfeit their privacy by sharing data even in a \"limited\" fashion.\n\nHe said Facebook had taken different positions elsewhere, including in a California case where it likened information kept on social media accounts to information stored on smartphones, where privacy concerns might be greater.\n\nThat position is \"closer to the truth than the company's assertions in this case,\" Chhabria wrote. \"Sharing information with your social media friends does not categorically eliminate your privacy interest in that information.\"\n\nThe litigation covers Facebook users in the United States and United Kingdom whose information was shared with third parties without their consent since 2007.\n\nThe case is In re Facebook Inc Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-md-02843.", "description": "Judge lets Facebook privacy class action proceed, calls company's views 'so wrong'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF881WZ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
