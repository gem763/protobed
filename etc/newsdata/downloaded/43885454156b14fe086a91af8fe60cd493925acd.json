Basically I end up kicking off.\n\n\"Teachers don't notice you have it. They just think you're misbehaving and not concentrating in class and think you're naughty.\n\n\"I get told off a lot because I get anxious and don't do my work.\"\n\nImage caption Kai said he wanted to go to school and yearned to live an ordinary life\n\nHis mother said the family had been threatened with fines by the school and was even referred to social workers at one point.\n\nMs Bendall said there was no softening in the school's attitude, even after Kai had received his official diagnosis in early 2018.\n\n\"The whole process we've been through has been really traumatic for the last two to three years,\" she said.\n\n\"We were pressured by the school constantly - we're going to fine you if your child's attendance isn't 88% - and that put a lot of pressure on Kai.\n\nShe said she was working with Kai's teachers on a plan to get him into school more regularly as he prepared for his GCSEs but did not know how things would go.\n\n\"We talk about what he'd like to do in the future and how he can achieve [that] but at this point I don't know if he'll get any GCSEs,\" she said.\n\nMind has called for school refusal to be given more recognition to stop young sufferers being tagged as truants.\n\nVicki Nash, head of policy and campaigns, said: \"We really need to have a fundamental rethink about how we can make sure pupils with mental health problems can stay in school.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nCharacteristics of school refusal\n\nEmotional distress about attending school\n\nAnxiety, temper, depression or physical symptoms.
