It's a five roast potato minimum, with the option to have at least 2/3 more than the extras bowl.\n\n'And no one I know wants one whole parsnip to themselves.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'They need to double up everything on there for it to be truly a Christmas meal.'\n\nOne added: 'Is this from the days of rationing?'\n\nOthers agreed, with one commenting: 'So so sad about the parsnip, my one solitary parsnip in a tiny dribble of gravy.'\n\nSocial media users were outraged by the graphic, with some pointing out the quantities weren't enough, and others suggesting that vital elements were missing from the Christmas dinner\n\nOthers were shocked by the 100ml of gravy, with one posting: 'MORE GRAVY MORE GRAVY! Don't make me come up there now!'\n\nOthers pointed out that the graphic didn't include several essentials of a Christmas dinner, with one commenting: 'Pigs in blankets are unlimited.'\n\nMeanwhile another wrote: 'Oi! Stuffing! Bread sauce! Cranberry! Something green that isn't sprouts! Your XMAS dinner is rubbish.'\n\nBBC Good Food magazine went on to share an image to help explain their calculations, and suggested that one potato could actually create up to four roasties\n\n'What about the cauliflower cheese?' another wrote. 'Where's the Yorkshires? The cranberry jelly? The stuffing? The sweet potatoes? Dear god, it's like Cromwell is back.'\n\nBBC Good Food magazine went on to share a graphic which helped to explain their calculations.\n\nThey clarified that they had intended that one large potato or two small potatoes could be cut up into as many as four pieces to create four roast potatoes.", "description": "Alice Pope, from Southampton, sparked the debate after sharing the BBC Good Food magazine's portion-size guide to help cooks plan what to buy for the Christmas feast.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/12/20176544-0-image-a-35_1572001954999.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
