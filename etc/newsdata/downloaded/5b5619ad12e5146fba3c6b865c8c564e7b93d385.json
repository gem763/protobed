He said his administration \"will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately.\"\n\nThe president's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulavey, held a press conference Thursday announcing the choice of Doral for the summit. He insisted his staff had concluded it was \"far and away the best physical facility.\" Mulvaney said the White House reached that determination after visiting 10 sites across the country.\n\nTrump had been the first administration official to publicly float the selection of his property to host the summit when in August he mentioned it was on the short-list and praised its facilities and proximity to Miami's international airport. His comments, more than a month before the official announcement, drew instant criticism from good governance groups and Democrats, who said it raised concerns that Trump was using the White House to boost his personal finances\n\nThe vociferous criticism did not die down, even as Trump insisted he would host the summit at cost, though he refused to disclose financial details. The annual heads-of-state gathering would at minimum have provided good-will value to his property.\n\nAn hour before Trump's announcement, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden condemned the selection of Doral for the summit. \"Hosting the G7 at Trump's hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain,\" the former vice president.\n\nOn Thursday, Mulvaney had discounted Camp David, the government-owned presidential retreat, as the site for the summit, claiming, \"I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G7.\" He added that it was too small and remote for the international summit.\n\nMulvaney said then that unspecified sites in Hawaii and Utah had also been on the short list. It was unclear if they were still under consideration.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
