In August, BP said it had reached a deal that will see Hilcorp take over all its oil fields and operations in Alaska, a $7.2billion deal (\u00a356 billion).\n\nBut the sale also had a sting in the tail as the company was forced to write off $2.6billion (\u00a32billion) because of tax charges, swinging BP to a $749 million (\u00a3583million) loss for the quarter.\n\n'Today's third quarter numbers weren't expected to come in close to the levels seen in second quarter given the decline in oil prices seen since then, however they still show a company that is nimbler and more efficient than it was a decade ago,' said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\nThe oil major also entered troubled waters as the impact of Hurricane Barry, which ripped through the Gulf of Mexico in July, shutting down oil fields, helped push down oil and gas production by 2.5 per cent.\n\nProduction is expected to increase in the fourth quarter from the period before as the company completes maintenance on its sites.\n\nDavid Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, commented: 'Lower oil prices, maintenance and weather impacts have combined to swing BP to a loss \u2013 albeit, the results are ahead of expectations.\n\n'This quarter's performance could be seen as a reminder of just how much of a difference volatile oil prices can have on the majors' results. Despite the loss, there are positives to take from the expansion of the downstream business, the progress of BP's divestment programme, and greater cash flow.\n\n'However, the upstream division and gearing remaining beyond target are areas for concern, while investors will also take a short-term hit from the scrapping of the scrip dividend.'", "description": "Underlying replacement cost profit, the term BP uses for net income, fell to 2.3 billion dollars in the third quarter of the year.", "authors": ["Press Association", "This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
