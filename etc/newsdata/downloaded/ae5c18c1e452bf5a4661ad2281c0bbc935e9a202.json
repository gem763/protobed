Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersWarren to protest with striking Chicago teachers Sanders: 'Outrageous' to suggest Gabbard 'is a foreign asset' Democratic strategist: Sanders seeking distance from Warren could 'backfire' MORE (I-Vt.) in his improbable bid for the nomination against Clinton in the last cycle.\n\n\u201cAny time that Hillary Clinton dips her name into the 2020 election it is horrible for us,\u201d said one Democratic fundraiser. \u201cIt helps Trump when Democrats are fighting with one another and this controversy just reopens those old wounds.\u201d\n\nThe allegations have put the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in a tough spot as it seeks to balance concerns about foreign government interference while remaining neutral in the primary.\n\nGabbard has accused the DNC of \u201crigging\u201d the primary with fundraising and polling requirements that have made it difficult for her and other candidates to qualify for the debates.\n\nThe Hawaii Democrat has not yet qualified for the November debate, although on Monday she hit the threshold in the first of four qualifying polls she would need to make the stage next month.\n\nThe DNC declined to comment for this story, but it has stood by the qualifying requirements, noting it has been transparent about the thresholds while managing a massive field of contenders.\n\nAn official also said that the DNC has invested heavily to secure its networks and monitor online disinformation about the Democratic presidential contenders.\n\nHowever, Clinton\u2019s insinuation that Gabbard may be an unwitting Russian asset voiced a concern that some party insiders have been whispering about in private for some time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are still bitter feelings over the perception that Green Party candidate Jill Stein may have drawn votes away from Clinton in key battleground states in 2016.\n\nAnd there is genuine disgust among a subset of Democrats who view Gabbard as a fringe candidate with peculiar views running a quixotic campaign that has drawn supportive remarks from controversial figures on the right, such as pro-Trump commentator Mike Cernovich and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.\n\nGabbard has rejected the support of Duke, but she continues to annoy Democrats by sitting for interviews with Fox News Channel\u2019s Tucker Carlson Tucker CarlsonClinton attacks on Gabbard become flashpoint in presidential race Zuckerberg launches public defense of Facebook as attacks mount NBC-Universal rejects outside investigation of Matt Lauer MORE.\n\nOn Monday, Trump came to Gabbard\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201c[Clinton is] accusing everyone of being a Russian agent,\u201d the president said. \u201cThese people are sick. There\u2019s something wrong with them.\u201d\n\nGabbard\u2019s allies insist she is not running a campaign meant to appeal to the right, but that her attacks on the establishment and dissent from Democratic orthodoxy resonate with outsiders everywhere, including some Trump supporters.\n\nAnd they\u2019re furious at what they view as a smear campaign orchestrated by Clinton and underscored by a recent New York Times story that quoted Clinton allies highlighting Gabbard\u2019s support on the right and insinuating that the Russian government is tacitly aiding her campaign.\n\n\u201cPeople warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my political career,\u201d Gabbard said in a video released over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThey said Clinton will never forget, that she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and in the media, will make sure you are destroyed. Well there have been countless hit pieces full of smears against me from Day One of this campaign. They\u2019ve tried to destroy my reputation and my lifetime of service because I stood up to them.\u201d\n\nAllies of Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisClinton attacks on Gabbard become flashpoint in presidential race Poll: Biden holds 10-point lead nationally over Warren Trump declines to participate in Weather Channel 2020 climate change special MORE (D-Calif.) have joined the chorus of attacks against Gabbard, pointing to what they say is suspicious online activity that amplified Gabbard\u2019s attacks on Harris\u2019s record as a prosecutor.\n\nThere is no evidence that Gabbard\u2019s campaign is working with Russia, and experts note that online Russian bot activity is often aimed at sowing broad divisions across many different groups in the U.S.\n\nGabbard\u2019s defenders view the attacks from Harris as retribution from their debate clash, and they say the attacks from Clinton are retaliation against Gabbard for resigning as vice chairwoman of the DNC in 2016 to protest the national party\u2019s treatment of Sanders.\n\n\u201cEven for a Clinton, this is the worst kind of McCarthyite slander, perhaps conjured up with no evidence over too many glasses of Chardonnay with her best friends and masters of deception at Goldman Sachs,\u201d said Jonathan Tasini, a progressive strategist who supports Sanders.\n\n\u201cThe rich irony here is that if anyone is a paid asset of a foreign government, it\u2019s Hillary Clinton, whose foundation has happily pocketed millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia whose dictators oppress women and are carrying out a genocidal war against civilians in Yemen, none of which seems to bother her.\u201d\n\nSeveral 2020 presidential candidates, including tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang Andrew YangOn The Money: Trump dismisses 'phony Emoluments Clause' after Doral criticism | Senate Dems signal support for domestic spending package | House panel to consider vaping tax Sanders: 'Outrageous' to suggest Gabbard 'is a foreign asset' Clinton attacks on Gabbard become flashpoint in presidential race MORE, former Rep.

My much bigger disappointment is with the candidates who were given an opportunity to start calling out Russian interference and failed miserably.\u201d", "description": "Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gabbardtulsi_100519getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
