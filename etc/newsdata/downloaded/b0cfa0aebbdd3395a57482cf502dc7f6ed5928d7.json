Heritage senior policy analyst, Justin Bogie released the following response:\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve budgets that take the fiscal future of our country seriously. Congress has once again delivered a bloated spending bill that fails to reduce wasteful spending, even as our national debt has just crossed over the once-unthinkable $22 trillion mark.\n\n\u201cWith weeks to negotiate since the last shut down, it is unfortunate to see a last-minute rush to pass a bill that does nothing to curtail Congress\u2019 reckless spending habits. Lawmakers must get serious about following the budget process that\u2019s already in place and stop this dysfunction. American taxpayers cannot afford another year of irresponsible spending and budget uncertainty.\u201d", "description": "Tonight, less than 24 hours after legislative text was released, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a nearly 1,200 page omnibus spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.
