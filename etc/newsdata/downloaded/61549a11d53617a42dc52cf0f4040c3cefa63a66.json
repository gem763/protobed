In it, Malkin explains that a key problem with the United States' immigration system is what she describes as \"The Kiddie Catch, Release, and Cash In Scam.\" Who is making money in this phony endeavor and how does the United States government let it continue? Malkin gave Townhall some exclusive insight into Open Borders Inc.\n\nFirst, this scam began with Bill Clinton's 1997 Flores agreement, which stated the U.S. government would not detain unaccompanied illegal immigrant children unless these children were given certain standards of care. Illegal families would often be detained and released all together, as well. But iIn effect, smugglers took advantage of this agreement by charging foreign nationals thousands of dollars to take their children to the U.S. border. These children would be dumped off, taken in by the government, and given an education, housing, shelter and many more benefits. In the summer of 2019, the Trump administration announced the government would end Flores -- meaning children will now be held for more than 20 days and they would not be separated from their accompanying adults at the border. But, will this help stop the deluge of illegal immigrants at the border?\n\nTownhall asked Malkin what effect -- if any -- this decision will have on what she says is the \"true moral outrage\" of \"a transnational network of open-border opportunists\" who have \"created a de facto illegal alien child smuggling ring operating in plain sight under the guise of family reunification and phony 'refugee resettlement.'\"\n\n\"The Trump administration's move to terminate the Flores agreement is long overdue and will substantially reduce the catch-and-release scams exploiting illegal alien children,\" Malkin told Townhall. \"But it's just one step.\"\n\nAs Malkin details in her book, the giant racket was enabled by Republican and Democratic presidents alike. In 1997, Clinton's administration set the framework for a more than generous welfare state for arriving illegal immigrant minors.\n\nClinton immigration bureaucrats agreed to provide food, clothing, personal grooming items, medical and dental care, family planning services, academic classes, \u201cappropriate reading materials in languages other than English for use\u201d during the minor\u2019s recreational times, \u201cat least one hour a day of large muscle activity,\u201d \u201cstructured leisure time activities,\u201d social work, group counseling, \u201caccess to religious services of the minor\u2019s choice,\u201d \u201clegal services information regarding the availability of free legal assistance, the right to be represented by counsel,\u201d \u201cthe right to a deportation or exclusion hearing,\u201d and \u201cthe right to apply for political asylum.\u201d\n\nPresident Bush continued to harm America's immigration policy via misguided attempts to protect victims of sex trafficking.\n\nAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President Bush signed the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferring responsibility for unaccompanied alien children (UACs) from immigration enforcement agencies to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement (HHS/ORR). In 2008, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act was signed into law at the end of the Bush administration. Intended to stop child sex trafficking ....the act gave children from non-contiguous countries (countries other than Mexico and Canada) full immigration court hearing privileges instead of being summarily turned away....Word spread to Central America that if illegal alien parents in the U.S. could shell out for smugglers....to guide their unaccompanied children across the border, the kids would \u201cend up in immigration limbo with little threat of deportation\u2014all the while getting a decent education.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama only exacerbated the problem with his Deferred Action Childhood arrivals program.\n\nIn June 2012, President Obama announced his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive order granting amnesty to illegal alien youth who had arrived in the U.S. by 2007 before age sixteen. In November 2014, Obama expanded the mass deportation pardons to a wider group of illegal aliens who had been in the country since 2010, extended the work authorization grace period from two to three years, and created the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) for illegal alien parents of anchor babies and green card-holding children.\n\nDuring his administration, the government also determined that they would not hold children for more than 20 days. So what does President Trump need to do once and for all to stop illegal immigration?\n\n\"We need immediate expedited removals of everyone at the border, including minors. We need swift criminal prosecution of illegal alien parents paying coyotes to haul their children through the desert,\" Malkin suggested.\n\nWhat sort of legal action can Americans take to stop these smugglers and illegal immigrant children? Malkin says not much unless more law professionals find the courage to take on \"Open Borders Inc.\"\n\n\"And we need litigation by patriotic attorneys who will force the courts to grant legal standing to American citizens harmed when human traffickers and their illegal alien beneficiaries cost our nation untold billions of dollars in health, education, welfare, and public safety -- let alone the untold bloodshed spilled by illegal alien gangsters and drug cartels,\" the bestselling author explained.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about Open Borders Inc., Malkin may be traveling to a Sanctuary City near you sometime soon.", "description": ".09/09/2019 19:15:08PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/townhall/reu/o/2018/331/71e0a3f1-ba52-4e87-824a-e45d869ee12f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
