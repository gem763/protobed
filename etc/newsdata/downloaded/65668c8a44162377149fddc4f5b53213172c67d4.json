Of this, nearly \u00a35,000 is interest that has been incurred since I began receiving student finance in 2015 - still at least I've paid off \u00a326\n\nOver the same period, thanks to an interest rate charged on my borrowing of the Retail Prices Index rate of inflation plus 3 per cent, the sum that I owe grew by \u00a32,285.04.\n\nThat \u00a326 then probably just about covered the interest incurred over four days spent drinking cheap vodka and even cheaper rose wine in Croatia near the end of my time at university in April 2018.\n\nOf course, it's worth noting that this \u00a326 is not a wholly accurate representation of what I would repay in any given year, due to the fact I only graduated university in July 2018 and started full-time employment in January 2019, but it still makes for uncomfortable reading.\n\nMaking the matter even worse, that interest rate doesn't even seem right. You're supposed to be charged RPI plus 3 per cent for the time you're studying, at which point it falls to RPI plus a certain amount up to 3 per cent depending on how much you are earning.\n\nBut I graduated university in July 2018, and have still been charged that figure up until April 2019.\n\nI was told this is because of the way Student Finance England does its sums, and the downward revision of the interest rate occurs in the April after graduation, meaning you're basically being overcharged for eight months to make their life easier.\n\nMy story is probably identical to those of hundreds of thousands if not millions of young people across the UK.\n\nNot only have those of us who went to university from September 2012 faced tuition fees of at least \u00a39,000 a year, but former Chancellor George Osborne also decided to hike the interest rate.\n\nThe rate on what is essentially government-backed debt secured on decades of our future earnings went from being neutral in real terms - as it was previously in line with inflation - to more expensive than mortgages, personal loans and new car finance.\n\nThe current system also involves a measure of inflation (the retail prices index) that almost everyone in a position of authority thinks is nonsense, rather than the official consumer prices index measure.\n\nFurthermore, student loans begin to incur interest from the moment you take them out, despite being in full-time education and thus unlikely to be able to make any repayments.\n\nThat is how I ended up borrowing more than \u00a338,000, on top of which I then accumulated more than \u00a34,700 in interest charges after the first maintenance loan payment from Student Finance England hit my bank account in September 2015.\n\nHow to run up student debt: George Nixon's statement shows how in four years he went from owing nothing to \u00a343,160\n\nEven if you disregard the thorny issue of expensive tuition fees, it's astonishing that the British Government has, for the last six-and-a-bit years, thought this was a perfectly sensible way to run a student loan system.\n\nThe somewhat odd first line of defence is, 'Don't worry, you might not pay it all back'.\n\nThis came back to bite the Government somewhat when it was recently told that the outlay really ought to be classed as government spending, because not enough people are paying back their loans and there's an enormous hole in the Treasury's balance sheet.\n\nIt's long seemed to me that anyone with half a brain could see this and would say: 'Of course this is a problem, in most cases the repayments aren't even covering the cost of the interest being charged on the loans, which becomes meaningless when the annual repayments are often less than the interest being tacked on.'\n\nThe current system has thus spawned two things:\n\n1. A cottage industry in devising ways to beat the system and pay off the loan in bulk before the interest on it gets out of hand.\n\nOur sister titles the Mail on Sunday and Money Mail have both had a go at guides to do this over the past year, and they're both definitely worth reading if you've got the financial firepower.\n\nThe problem is that even doing that splits people into those who can afford to do so, and who can thus look forward to getting student-debt free, or those whose only hope would be to borrow from someone like their parents at a cheaper rate instead of the Government.\n\nPaying off your loan early should always carry the caveat that for some it doesn't make financial sense, however, even those who may end up with their debt wiped many years in the future may not fancy decades with owing tens of thousands of pounds hanging over them.\n\nTowards the end of her time in office, Prime Minister Theresa May ordered a review into the funding of higher education\n\n2. A long overdue government review into higher education funding, published at the end of May \u2013 both the month and the prime minister.\n\nIt proposed reducing the total cost of fees and the interest charged on them, but also extending the time period before debt is wiped out and reducing the earnings threshold at which you start making repayments.\n\nThe latter two proposals made it pretty clear to me that this report was designed with the benefit of the public finances in mind, rather than students, and the response therefore wasn't entirely positive - in many cases for valid reasons.\n\nWhat it's worth I'm not totally opposed to these potential proposals, even though such a shake-up would likely leave me paying more.\n\nWhile this probably paints me as the swottish kid in the class asking the teacher for more homework, ultimately if we perceive a university education to confer certain advantages that make it worth a premium, wouldn't you rather pay back that education's cost rather than making meaningless payments for 30 years that barely cover the interest only for the debt to eventually be wiped out?\n\nBecause right now, if my experience is any indication, the current system is the financial equivalent of trying to bail out the Titanic with a tea mug with a massive hole in the bottom of it.
