But If you\u2019re not ready for #hotgirlsummer to end, investing in a fake tan will help you stay golden all year long.\n\nOne of the more controversial beauty products, many of us steer clear of fake tanning through fear of looking like an oompa loompa, smelling like a biscuit or staining our bed sheets.\n\nBut fake tan formulas have moved on from the days of streakiness and startling shades. Traditional mousses are still a firm favourite, but brands are finding new ways to get us glowing, from tanning waters and gels to mists and serums.\n\nWe\u2019ve been on the hunt for the best instant tans on the market and as avid fake tanners ourselves, our criteria was strict. The bronzers that made the cut had to apply easily leaving no streaks.\n\nWe rejected any that had the biscuit-like, telltale scent and were looking for shades that produced an authentic looking tan, whether they were light or dark. We also considered how the tan lasted and didn\u2019t include any that went patchy after a couple of days, or irritated our skin.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a serial tanner or a complete novice, our top tip is to always use a mitt to apply the tan and to exfoliate and moisturise beforehand. Focus on drier areas such as elbows, ankles, hands and wrists as fake tan can stick to dry skin and become telltale signs of a bad job.\n\nTo make your tan last even longer, continue moisturising every night when wearing it. Invest in some exfoliating gloves and a good body scrub to remove your tan when it starts going patchy and to prepare your skin for the next layer.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

It glided on smoothly and didn\u2019t cling on to dry areas, this is thanks to the inclusion of coconut oil which acts as a moisturiser without compromising on the tan\u2019s colour.\n\nA lot of ultra-dark tanning shades can come up ashy so we were sceptical of the purple undertone in this formula, but it develops into the most natural-looking tan we tried; giving us a deep looking glow while still looking golden. This smells fresh and coconut-y and develops in 4-6 hours, but also stays perfect for around five days after applying.\n\nIt dried within minutes and left no sticky residue. Our only bugbear was that it was hard to tell what colour the tan would develop to after the initial application, it does go a lot darker so we wouldn\u2019t recommend a double layer. This also comes in light and medium shades, but the dark sells out fast so add this to your basket, quick.\n\nBuy now\n\nBondi Sands aero aerated tanning foam, 225ml: \u00a318.99, Look Fantastic\n\nTaking the mousse formula to new heights, tanning heavyweight Bondi Sands has recently launched this aerated tan that is designed to instantly absorb into the skin. It has a strong smell, but if you like pina coladas that shouldn\u2019t be a problem, and it does live up to its claims of drying instantly, with vitamin E and jojoba adding to the hydrating, effortless feel of the formula.\n\nWhat we liked most about this tan was that the colour was instant: a dark, deep brown that still had golden undertones which kept it looking natural. This gives one of the most authentic finishes we\u2019ve used; someone in the office asked if we\u2019d been on holiday when we wore it which is a testimony in itself. We also love how buildable this is as it doesn\u2019t go patchy, you can layer up.\n\nWe found the applicator quite hard to use, the nozzle breaks easily and it\u2019s hard to control how much product is dispersed, but with a bit of practice it was fine. This long-lasting formula is definitely one of our new favourites.\n\nBuy now\n\nDoll Beauty doll tan in medium, 200ml: \u00a318, Beauty Bay\n\nThis tan had one of our favourite scents out of every formula we tested. The brand calls it a \u201crose-marshmallow\u201d fragrance, but we thought it smelt more like caramel or chocolate; either way, it\u2019s divine and not too overpowering. Perhaps the most boujee ingredient to grace a fake tan formula, Doll Beauty infuses its tan with caviar extract which helps to nourish the skin.\n\nThe colour of this is on the warmer side than other tans we tried, but it isn\u2019t at all orange, leaving a golden brown finish reminiscent of a post-holiday glow. It took a bit more time to work into the skin than other mousses we tried, but the instant colour payoff and coverage was worth it, drying quickly with no streaks.\n\nWe preferred the colour of the light shade to the dark one and would suggest building this to achieve a darker tan. The colour lasts well for about a week, but does need scrubbing off after.\n\nBuy now\n\nCocoa Brown Marissa Carter 1hr instant tan extra dark, 150ml: \u00a37.99, Superdrug\n\nAs a firm favourite of Love Island contestant Olivia Buckland, you\u2019ve probably seen this tan all over Instagram. We were intrigued by its one hour develop time claim, especially given it\u2019s an extra dark shade, and felt it wasn\u2019t as dark as other formulas we tried upon application, but did develop after an hour into a deep shade that we loved. We kept it on overnight (brave, we know) and were happy with the results, it doesn\u2019t go ashy if you leave it on longer than advised.\n\nThe applicator was quite hard to control but we liked the fresh cucumber scent. The tan dries quickly too, but we wouldn\u2019t recommend this for drier skin types as it did begin to crack and go patchy after a few days on our tester who suffers with dry skin.\n\nBuy now\n\nUTAN & Tone cherry and almond turbo mousse, 150ml: \u00a324, Look Fantastic\n\nAnother tan with a strong smell, if you like cherry flavoured sweets then you\u2019ll love this; it doesn\u2019t smell chemically but fruity and fresh. UTAN offers one of the most technical tanning formulas we found, with organic tanning agents that develop at different times to help all skin tones achieve an even, streak-free tan. The brand advises when to wash off based on what colour you want to achieve.\n\nThis produced one of the most instant and darkest colour payoffs of all we tried, with a deep purple undertone that still left us feeling golden rather than ashy. It does feel stickier than other tans when you first apply, but it does dry within around ten minutes and develops really nicely.\n\nBuy now\n\nSt Tropez purity bronzing water gel, 200ml: \u00a319.95, Amzaon\n\nA household name in the tanning world, St Tropez products are hard to beat so we were excited to try its new water gel formula that promises extra hydration for a more long-lasting, even tan.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say we were impressed, this has fast become our go-to for an effortlessly fast glow that feels more like a moisturiser than a fake tan. We\u2019d especially recommend this for anyone with dry skin or for fake tan newbies, as its gel formula makes application totally fool-proof and instantly hydrating.\n\nIt feels soothing and cool on the skin, with the signature tropical scent that takes us straight to the beach. The colour is golden, natural and long-lasting and the formula makes this really easy to build. It does stay quite tacky on the skin for a while after applying but there was no colour transfer on our sheets and we love its hydrating properties.\n\nBuy now\n\nBali Body self tanning mousse in dark, 200ml: \u00a325.95, Bali Body\n\nThis is the closest we\u2019ve got to achieving a deep golden sun-kissed tan in minutes without hitting the beach. If you\u2019re looking for a dark tan that is more on the warm side than cool toned, we seriously recommend this. Bali Body\u2019s tan applies effortlessly, we barely had to concentrate when putting this on as it\u2019s easy to achieve an even, smooth coverage quickly.\n\nThere is no fake tan smell and no overpowering smell to mask it, just a fresh cucumber scent. Infused with chamomile, coffee seed and pomegranate, this formula is nourishing and brightening, feeling hydrating upon application.\n\nIt didn\u2019t irritate our tester\u2019s sensitive skin and we love the colour which lasts for a good five days or so. The only downside is that it does stay sticky for a while after applying but it\u2019s totally worth the wait.\n\nBuy now\n\nSt. Moriz advanced pro fast response tanning mist: \u00a37.99, Superdrug\n\nA budget-friendly favourite, St.Moriz has been one of our go-tos for years. We love the brand\u2019s mousse formula but were equally as impressed with this tanning mist which was easier to use than it may look.\n\nPerfect for a quick glow-up before a night out, the mist applicator makes it easy to control how much product you apply and where and the colour develops within an hour, just leave it on for longer to achieve a darker tan.\n\nWe\u2019d recommend this for paler skin tones as it is a golden colour that isn\u2019t very dark. We\u2019re pleased to find that St. Moriz has said goodbye to the biscuit scent and replaced it with a fresh smell that is non-offensive. This is a fast-drying, easy-to-use formula which is great for last minute tanners.\n\nBuy now\n\nFake Bake ultimate gel double shot espresso tan, 120ml: \u00a324.95, Look Fantastic\n\nIf you hate coffee, this might not be the tan for you with its rich, espresso martini-esque scent, but we really love it and there\u2019s no telltale fake tan smell in sight. Another gel formula similar to the St Tropez tan, you may panic at first when you apply to the skin as it looks like it could go streaky. But fear not, it buffs in beautifully and gives an even coverage which dries almost instantly.\n\nThe gel consistency is hydrating and gives a really natural finish without compromising on colour pay-off. It doesn\u2019t stick to dry patches and lasts really well (for about a week) while being buildable. The colour is dark but authentic, we love taking this on holiday with us to top up our tan. Our only complaint is that the bottle isn\u2019t as big as most other fake tans so it runs out quicker.\n\nBuy now\n\nJames Read coconut dry body tan oil, 100ml: \u00a325, Look Fantastic\n\nAnother recommendation for anyone with drier skin, this tanning oil is incredibly nourishing on the skin. It is lightweight and easier to apply than a mousse, but the transparent formula makes it hard to tell where you\u2019ve applied it which can take some practice. But we love the light golden glow that this gives, acting as a moisturiser as well as a tan with hints of coconut oil and vitamin E.\n\nThis has a slightly longer development time than other tans here at 3-5 hours, but if you\u2019re looking to build a natural-looking tan before you go on holiday to get your real one, this is great to use the week beforehand. The formula is non-greasy despite being an oil and it didn\u2019t leave us with any streaks. A must have for those who want an easy application and a subtle golden tan.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Fake tans\n\nFor a deep, long-lasting tan that is a dream to apply while feeling hydrating on the skin, our winner has to be Isle of Paradise. If you\u2019re looking for something ultra-moisturising and more natural, go for St Tropez\u2019 purity bronzing water gel.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
