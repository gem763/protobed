(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThe number of migrants taken into custody along the U.S. southern border fell 22 percent \u2014 to 64,006 \u2014 in August, acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said Monday, crediting President Trump\u2019s June 7 immigration enforcement agreement with Mexico for a sharp drop in unauthorized crossings this summer.\n\nBorder arrests peaked at more than 144,000 in May, an influx that prompted Trump to threaten Mexico with crippling tariffs unless the government of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took immediate steps to curb the flow.\n\nMexico responded by deploying thousands of national guard troops to ramp up arrests and intercept more Central American families heading north. Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, is scheduled to meet with Vice President Pence and other senior Trump administration officials Tuesday to take stock of the enforcement effort.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at The White House, Morgan said the administration was \u201cabsolutely encouraged,\u201d by the declining arrests, \u201cbut we know these numbers could always spike upwards.\u201d\n\n[Mexico\u2019s crackdown on migrants is stalling, U.S. officials say ahead of talks]\n\nMorgan also said the percentage of migrants who arrive as part of family groups fell from 70 percent to 55 percent last month. The change is significant, he said, because parents who arrive with children are much more likely to be released into the U.S. interior after they are processed, rather than detained and deported.\n\nOverall, border arrests are down 56 percent since the June 7 Mexico accord, Morgan said.\n\nDespite the steep decline in crossings this summer, arrests in August remained at their highest level in a decade, and the number of migrants taken into custody during the 2019 fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 will probably reach nearly 1 million, a level not seen since the George W. Bush administration.\n\nHomeland Security officials say illegal crossings typically increase during the autumn months as scorching temperatures ease, and they will urge Mexico this week to do more to avoid a rebound. Officials also have said that the percentage of northbound migrants arrested by Mexico is diminishing, in what they view as a sign of flagging efforts. \u201cWe need Mexico to do more,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nMorgan, the country\u2019s top border security official, also said the United States should not be so dependent on Mexico and other nations to compensate for a dysfunctional U.S. immigration system.\n\n\u201cWe cannot rely solely on the government of Mexico or our Central American partners,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cUnless the laws change, these numbers will rise again next year, just as we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d\n\nMexican officials say they have delivered on their promises to drive the numbers down, and they think Trump\u2019s tariff threat should be off the table. White House officials have not said that, and in recent days having been trying to credit the president for securing the Mexico deal while also signaling that they are still not satisfied.\n\n\u201cLooking forward to meeting with Mexican gov officials tomorrow to talk about their recent efforts & discuss ways we can continue to secure the border,\u201d Pence said Monday in a tweet. \u201cThere is still more work to do!\u201d\n\nThe monthly arrest totals reported by CBP are the most widely used yardstick for measuring fluctuations in unauthorized migration. The figures include adults and children taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol between official crossings, or ports of entry, as well as those deemed \u201cinadmissible\u201d and detained at those entry points.\n\nMorgan told reporters the United States has sent more than 42,000 asylum seekers back to Mexico to wait outside U.S. territory for their claims to be processed under an experimental program called the \u201cMigration Protections Protocols\u201d (MPP). He urged Mexican authorities to allow the Trump administration to send even more migrants out of the country, describing the program as a key deterrent.\n\nAsked whether the administration was tracking reports of asylum seekers being extorted and kidnapped after being turned back by the MPP program, Morgan said Mexico has provided \u201cnothing to the United States corroborating or verifying those allegations.\u201d\n\nMorgan, who was named acting commissioner by Trump in June but has not been nominated for the job permanently, also told reporters that he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d by a U.S. District Court judge\u2019s ruling in California on Tuesday reinstating a nationwide injunction blocking the administration\u2019s attempt to disqualify asylum seekers who decline to seek protection in other nations while traveling to the U.S. border.\n\nMorgan called Judge Jon S. Tigar\u2019s injunction an example of \u201cjudicial activism.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery single time this administration comes up with what we believe is a legal rule or policy that we believe that will address this crisis, we end up getting enjoined,\u201d he said.", "description": "Mexico\u2019s top diplomat will meet with senior U.S. officials Tuesday to discuss status of the migration accord.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security", "September At Pm", "Nick Miroff Covers Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security For The Washington Post.
