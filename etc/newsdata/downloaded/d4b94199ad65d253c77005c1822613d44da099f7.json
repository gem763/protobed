Hundreds of flights had to be cancelled.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters fill the arrival hall at Hong Kong International Airport on 12 August\n\nMr Chan said in some areas, hotel occupancy rates in August fell by more than half, and house prices sank by as much as 70%.\n\n\"The retail and even the catering industry are similar. The most worrying thing is that the road ahead does not seem to be easy to get better,\" he said in a translation of the blog posted on Sunday.\n\nThe finance chief said the demonstrations have \"severely damaged Hong Kong's international image\" as a safe city for trade, aviation and finance.\n\nSome economists forecast the hit from the protests, coupled with the impact of US-China trade war, will push Hong Kong's economy into a technical recession later this year.\n\nThe shifting political landscape has also complicated the environment for many businesses in Hong Kong.\n\nCathay Pacific became embroiled in controversy over its response to demonstrations, with two executives including former boss Rupert Hogg quitting over the affair.", "description": "The number of visitors to the city tumbled last month as anti-government protests gripped the city.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07kl98j.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
