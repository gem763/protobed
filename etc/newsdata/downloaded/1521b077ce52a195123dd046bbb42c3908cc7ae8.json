The government also pledged to lower tax on rail tickets, raise charges on air travel and reform car tax in an effort to encourage a switch to cleaner modes of transport. It also promised to raise public spending on mass transit systems to \u20ac1 billion annually from 2021.\n\nThe emissions trading scheme, starting in 2021, would see fuel companies buy emissions permits covering fuels such gasoline, diesel and heating fuels. The government plans to set prices initially at \u20ac10 per ton of carbon dioxide; rising to \u20ac20 per ton in 2022 with further yearly increases up to \u20ac35 per ton in 2025. It plans to set a cap on emissions from 2026.\n\nBoth environmental campaigners and industry were quick to hammer the plan, released as millions of people took part in protests around the world calling for stronger action against climate change.\n\nPatrick Graichen of think tank Agora Energiewende called the German climate package \u201cshockingly power- and brave-less,\u201d and criticized the proposed CO2 price \u201cas a bad joke: \u20ac10 per ton won\u2019t have an impact.\u201d\n\nAngela Merkel maintained the emissions trading system would be a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d\n\nPlans to promote wind power similarly fall short, he said: \u201cThe 2030 climate goals will definitely not be met like that.\u201d\n\nThe national energy industry lobby BDEW said the package was \u201cdisappointing,\u201d calling out the government for being \u201ctoo hesitant on CO2 pricing and the necessary power price easing.\u201d\n\nDieter Kempf, the boss of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said it posed a problem for companies that could now face booming electricity and gas prices.\n\nBut German Chancellor Angela Merkel maintained the emissions trading system would be a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d during her press conference at a recently opened museum in downtown Berlin.\n\nA new aviation tax will be introduced from January 2020 under the plan. VAT on train tickets will drop from 19 percent to 7 percent, a move the government estimated will make traveling by train 10 percent cheaper. National rail company Deutsche Bahn announced it would buy 30 new trains to carry an estimated 5 million extra passengers a year due to the tax cut.\n\nThe government is planning financing of over \u20ac54 billion until 2023 to fund the measures, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said, adding: \u201cThis is a huge amount of money and we can only mobilize this because we will ... have additional income possibilities.\u201d\n\nThat includes revenue from the new air and car levies, in addition to cash from the emissions trading system to help pay for the costs.\n\nThe country\u2019s powerful Association of the Automotive Industry lobby group, the VDA, welcomed pledges to push electric cars, which included plans to install 1 million charging points by 2030. At present, Germany has just over 20,000 charging points.\n\nHowever, the BDI\u2019s Kempf said the plan to boost electric vehicle uptake by a factor of 50 by 2030 was at the \u201climit\u201d of what was possible.\n\nFriday\u2019s measures also aim at promoting wider use of renewable energy, including by scrapping a cap on promoting solar power as well as boosting offshore wind power. That\u2019s despite the fact that Bavaria recently won a battle to keep tougher rules on onshore wind \u2014 something the state\u2019s premier Markus S\u00f6der was keen to repeatedly stress during the press conference on Friday in Berlin.\n\nThe package was agreed following overnight negotiations between the climate cabinet \u2014 a body headed by Merkel and including key ministers whose briefs overlap with climate.\n\nIt comes as the coalition government scrambles to respond to popular pressure to tackle climate change, and loses ground to the Greens. It has already acknowledged it won\u2019t meet national and EU climate goals by 2020.", "description": "Berlin to introduce a national emissions trading system for the transport and building sectors.", "authors": ["Kalina Oroschakoff", "Joshua Posaner", "Paola Tamma", "Eline Schaart"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_55482142-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
