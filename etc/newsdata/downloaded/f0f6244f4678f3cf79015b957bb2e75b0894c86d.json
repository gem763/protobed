Protesters largely avoided pitched battles with the authorities, however, retreating and moving around the city quickly.\n\nInside New Town Plaza, a shopping mall in the northern Hong Kong town on Sha Tin, protesters targeted Chinese-owned businesses and those owned by the food and beverage conglomerate Maxim's, including Starbucks and Simply Life. Earlier this month , Annie Wu Suk-ching, daughter of Maxim's founder James Tak Wu, infuriated protesters when she publicly criticized them and defended police handling of the unrest.\n\nWhile the mall protests were initially light-hearted, including a conga line, they soon became more serious, with stores graffitied and regular business disrupted, forcing many to close. Trash cans in the mall were overturned, water sprayed over the floor from a hose, and television screens smashed, according to the South China Morning Post . A connecting subway station was also heavily vandalized, forcing it to be closed. Outside New Town Plaza, protesters set fire to barricades and threw a Chinese flag into a nearby river\n\nThere were similar scenes of chaos in malls in three other districts, and multiple other subway stations closed after being targeted by protesters.\n\nIn a dramatic incident captured on camera, a police officer managed to detain a protester in Tuen Mun despite coming under severe attack https://t.co/bxbI6ys41I pic.twitter.com/rl9dBOcX0Z\n\nIn a sign of how the protests are growing more violent and out of control, there were also several attacks on apparent bystanders during demonstrations Sunday, and protesters were recorded beating a riot officer with his own weapon and attempting to grab his sidearm.\n\nOne of the ugliest scenes came in Yuen Long, where protesters staged a sit in to mark two months since an attack at a subway station in the northern town by alleged triad groups. Two men who had shouted at protesters and appeared to threaten them with a bottle were beaten by a crowd , hit with bamboo sticks, poles and a metal chair, leaving them bloodied and dazed.\n\nMob brawls continue for another weekend in #HongKong, this time in Yuen Long up in the New Territories.

Pro-democracy parties in the city are hoping the unrest can see them take overall control of multiple district councils, but radical protesters may resent any attempt to pivot the opposition movement to an election footing.\n\nPeaceful and moderate groups have been increasingly marginalized in recent weeks, and limited attempts to reign in the violence unsuccessful. While it appears that there is still a deal of support for the movement -- sparked months ago by a now withdrawn extradition bill with China but expanded to include longstanding demands for greater democracy -- it is unclear how long ordinary Hong Kongers will tolerate the disruption, particularly as it is increasingly spreading to civilian rather than government targets.", "description": "There were more scenes of violence and destruction across Hong Kong over the weekend as protesters targeted subway stations and shopping malls in an apparent escalation as the city enters its sixteenth consecutive week of unrest.", "authors": ["James Griffiths"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190923105804-hong-kong-protest-0922-01-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
