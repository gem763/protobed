He\u2019s looked overwhelmed. As if there were no answers as to why his dominance has disappeared after signing a three-year, $43 million contract with the Chicago Cubs back in May.\n\nKimbrel\u2019s last nightmare outing\n\nKimbrel\u2019s struggles were on full display again on Saturday, and the results couldn\u2019t have been worse for Chicago. Tasked with protecting a one-run, ninth-inning lead in a game the Cubs absolutely had to win against the St. Louis Cardinals, Kimbrel served up game-tying and go-ahead home runs before the announcers were finished reading his stats.\n\nTwo pitches. Two home runs. The Cardinals grabbed a 9-8 lead. And the Cubs fell short again, potentially driving a dagger through their playoff chances.\n\nIt was the same story for Kimbrel in his previous outing.\n\nAfter returning from a two-week absence brought on by knee discomfort, Kimbrel gave up a game-winning home run to the Cardinals\u2019 Matt Carpenter in Thursday\u2019s 5-4, 10-inning loss.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was the same story many times before that one. Kimbrel hasn\u2019t been able to get the key outs or keep the baseball in the ballpark. After not allowing more than seven home runs in any previous season, he\u2019s already allowed nine this season. In less than 20 innings.\n\nwith today's outing Craig Kimbrel's season ERA rose to 3.92, a career high\n\n\n\nwait\n\n\n\nthat's home runs per nine \u2014 joe (@coffey_wafer) September 21, 2019\n\nKimbrel\u2019s ERA is actually 6.53. The blown save was his third in 16 opportunities. The loss his fourth in just 23 appearances.\n\nHe\u2019s been anything but the lockdown closer the Cubs hoped they were getting.\n\nUncertain offseason behind Kimbrel\u2019s struggles?\n\nLike top starting pitching free agent Dallas Keuchel, Kimbrel went unsigned during the offseason despite playing a key role in the Red Sox World Series championship last season. Kimbrel\u2019s reported $100 million asking price was too hefty for even the richest and most desperate of teams to consider investing. When the price lowered in May, the Cubs thought they\u2019d gotten a bargain to help fill the ninth-inning void in their struggling bullpen.\n\nWhat they\u2019ve gotten so far is a shell of the pitcher who was arguably the best at his job over the last decade.\n\nMaybe the offseason of uncertainty is a contributing factor. Maybe not having a real spring training has played a role. Kimbrel spent most of June in the minor leagues building up strength, but it\u2019s a different ballgame starting then as opposed to February. Perhaps there\u2019s more to the knee issue he missed time with. Though Kimbrel attempted to dismiss the latter following Saturday\u2019s outing.\n\nFrom The Athletic\u2019s Patrick Mooney:\n\n\u201cI was pumped out there. I was excited. I felt like I had good stuff. And then right there off the bat, two home runs. Frustrating,\u201d Kimbrel said Saturday. \u201cI feel great right now. My last two outings, I felt great. I just didn\u2019t get the results I wanted, the results I need to have to do my job. Moving forward, I have a good feeling I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cCraig\u2019s a Hall of Fame closer,\u201d teammate Anthony Rizzo said in support of Kimbrel. \u201cHe\u2019s got a track record for a reason. He puts in the work. We all see it. He\u2019s an amazing guy in the clubhouse. We have his back. It\u2019s tough. I know he feels bad, but he\u2019s a competitor and he\u2019s a champion and he\u2019ll bounce back.\u201d\n\nThe positive reinforcement is all well and good. But something is off. There\u2019s no question about that. It\u2019s too late for the Cubs to fix it this season, but with two years left on their deal it\u2019s something they\u2019ll need to figure out this winter. Otherwise their big bargain will turn into an even bigger regret.\n\nCubs $43 million closer Craig Kimbrel is having a dreadful season.
