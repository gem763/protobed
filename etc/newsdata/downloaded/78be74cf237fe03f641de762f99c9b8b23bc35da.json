The feature is called Oculus Link, and it was announced today by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the Oculus Connect developer conference in San Jose, California. \u201cYour Quest is basically a Rift now, too,\u201d Zuckerberg told the crowd during the conference\u2019s keynote address.\n\nThe Quest launched back in May as a proper cordless VR headset, meaning it contains the lenses, sensors, processor, battery, and other components necessary for playing VR games and experiences without requiring any external hardware whatsoever. Zuckerberg says Oculus is selling Quest \u201cas fast as we can make them,\u201d and he also mentioned that Quest accounts for 20 percent of the $100 million in lifetime VR software sales the Oculus platform has generated since its 2016 launch.\n\nBut one big limitation of the Quest is that its lower-end processor and battery-dependent power source limit the types of VR experiences it can run. That should change with Oculus Link. Zuckerberg says the feature will support most USB-C cables, so you can use the cable that comes bundled with the Quest to charge it for instance. So long as you have a gaming PC with the minimum spec requirements, outlined here on Oculus\u2019 website, you\u2019ll then be able to access the most graphics-intensive VR titles.", "description": "Facebook-owned Oculus VR is launching an update in November for its standalone Quest headset that will allow it to be plugged into any virtual reality-ready gaming PC to access the entire Rift library.
