Yukie Nishizawa/Pool via REUTERS\n\nRio de Janeiro club Flamengo are scheduled to play Argentine side River Plate in the final at Santiago\u2019s National stadium on Nov. 23 and Bolsonaro\u2019s possible attendance has upset some of the Brazilian team\u2019s fans.\n\nThe stadium has a portion of the stands sealed off as a memorial to those who were detained there and died under the 1973-1990 military regime of General Augusto Pinochet.\n\nThe stadium was used as a detention and torture centre for opponents of the regime following the coup that overthrew the democratically elected Salvador Allende.\n\n\u201cI am studying the possibility, at the request of a large part of the Flamengo fans in my ministry, my government, my cabinet, to go to the final,\u201d Bolsonaro said while on a visit to China. \u201cI am absolutely certain we will all be Flamengo fans that day.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s appearance at the ground would be especially sensitive given his support for Pinochet and other far-right figures in the region.\n\nBolsonaro said last month that Chile \u201cwould now be a Cuba\u201d if not for Pinochet\u2019s intervention and he taunted Michelle Bachelet, the former president and now UN Commissioner for Human Rights, whose father was tortured by Pinochet\u2019s soldiers.\n\nCurrent Chilean president Sebastian Pinera criticised his counterpart\u2019s lack of respect and Bachelet said she \u201cfelt sorry for Brazil.\u201d\n\nThe idea Bolsonaro might go to Chile, which is in the midst of widespread popular protests over inequality, provoked anger amongst some Flamengo supporters.\n\n\u201cI lived in Chile,\u201d Flamengo fan Jorge Mutti wrote on twitter. \u201cFlamengo are popular there. My friends tell me an invite (to Bolsonaro) would lose them support.\u201d\n\nPopular columnist Mauro Cezar Pereira said if Flamengo invite Bolsonaro to the final it would show \u201ca lack of respect for the Chilean people.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro supports Palmeiras but the keen football fan has appeared at many Brazilian games wearing the shirts of other clubs, including Flamengo.\n\nHe gifted Chinese Premier Xi Jinping a Flamengo tracksuit on Friday, two days after they qualified for the final for the first time since 1981 by beating Gremio 5-0.", "description": "Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, an admirer of Latin America's military dictatorships, courted controversy on Friday when he said he might go to next month's Copa Libertadores final in the Chilean stadium once used as a detention centre.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444966790&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1NM", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
