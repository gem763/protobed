Not the idea of her vagina, but her actual vagina; its folds, curves, colors and depths. I\u2019ll wait.\n\nIn my view, the professional world is much better when genitalia are kept tucked out of sight, for the sake of efficiency, decency and those of us who simply want to get some work done. It\u2019s extremely unfortunate that we live in a world where you can be lingering over tea with a friend on a rainy day when \u2014 boom! \u2014 a famous man\u2019s penis pops up, so to speak, in conversation, and you realize that millions of people know something about what it looks like.\n\nThe descriptions never leave you. They fester in the mind like mold in typhoon season \u2014 especially if the mentions come from women who never wanted to see them in the first place. And especially when you live in a state, like New South Wales, Australia or a country, like the United States, where a recurrent theme in public debate is the control of female bodies, but not men\u2019s.\n\nSadly for me, this week I discovered, through no inquiry of my own, that the accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was asked during a deposition in 2009 if he had an egg-shaped penis. A friend casually brought it up while devouring a scone, squinting with the horror.", "description": "And sincerely wish I didn\u2019t.", "authors": ["Julia Baird"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/01/opinion/sunday/01baird/01baird-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
