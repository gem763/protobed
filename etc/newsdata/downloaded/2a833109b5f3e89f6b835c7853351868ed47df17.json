When Will Men Learn Consent?", "language": "en", "text": "Indian Idol season 11 is embroiled in a controversy with judge Neha Kakkar being forcibly kissed by a contestant on stage! Her fellow judges, Anu Malik and Vishal Dadlani, looked on in complete shock.\n\nVishal even went so far as wanting to call the police on the contestant, but Neha chose to let it go, even though she was visibly disturbed by what had happened. I mean, look at her expression.\n\nWhat had happened?\n\nThe contestant, who was dressed in traditional Gujarati attire, walked on to the stage with wrapped presents and a pink teddy bear in his hands. Neha Kakkar then goes on stage and the two exchange hugs. Then, in a moment that nobody anticipated, the contestant quickly turned his head and kissed Neha Kakkar on her cheek. She immediately recoils when this happens.\n\nAnu Malik and Vishal Dadlani seemed visibly disturbed by what had happened. Twitter was abuzz at this non-consensual kiss. Vishal tweeted that the contestant had some psychiatric issues and that it would be looked into. He had wanted tougher action against the rogue kisser but Neha decided not to pursue it.\n\nI suggested that the Police be called, but Neha decided to let the guy off the hook. He definitely needs psychiatric help, and we will try to help him get that, if we can. #IndianIdol11 https://t.co/CiCLy7u787 \u2014 VISHAL DADLANI (@VishalDadlani) October 20, 2019\n\nWhen will men learn consent?\n\nAditya Narayan, the host of the shot, went on to say that the contestant was a super fan of Neha\u2019s and that he even had a tattoo of Neha on his arms. In an interview, Aditya said that he was sure that the contestant didn\u2019t mean it in an inappropriate way, he just didn\u2019t know where to draw the line.\n\nBut, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s an excuse. Even if you are married to a woman, it does not give you the right to touch her without her consent. The fact that marital rape is not considered a crime in this country shows that Indian men--and some women--still don\u2019t understand the concept of consent.\n\nHere\u2019s a cartoon by popular cartoonist, Lunarbaboon, to make it easier to understand.\n\nKissing someone--man or woman--without their consent is sexual harassment. People\u2019s bodies should be respected. If someone does not want to be touched, kissed, or caressed, DON\u2019T do it.\n\nTeach your kids that as well. When they learn the concept of consent at a young age, they are less likely to cross the sexual harassment boundary. In turn, they will also make sure that nobody touches them without their consent either.\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to understand. There are no excuses for touching or kissing someone when they don\u2019t want it. Period.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A promo video of Indian Idol 11 shows Neha Kakkar being forcibly kissed by a contestant, while co-judges Vishal Dadlani and Anu Malik look on in shock.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_Neha-Kakkar-forcibly-kissed-on-Indian-Idol_Social_5db01b499f75d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
