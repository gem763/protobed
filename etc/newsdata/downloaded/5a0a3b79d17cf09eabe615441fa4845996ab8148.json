At his press conference last week after the central bank\u2019s rate decision, Powell said it\u2019s \u201ccertainly possible that we\u2019ll need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought.\u201d Among the most likely solutions to rein in short-term rates that briefly spiraled out of control is some sort of permanent open-market operations.\n\nNaturally, hearing \u201cgrowth of the balance sheet\u201d sounds to some like a return to quantitative easing \u2014 the post-crisis measure of purchasing Treasuries or other securities to inject liquidity into the financial system. The phrase \u201cQE-infinity\u201d is often tossed around as a swipe against meddling by central banks and their permanent role in propping up financial markets. Fed critics seized on Powell\u2019s words as confirmation that such infinite QE is around the corner.\n\nStrategists at Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks sought to head off that sort of framing almost immediately.\n\nThe key difference in \u201corganic growth\u201d of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet versus QE-style expansion, they say, is that the former comes about because of increased demand for the central bank\u2019s liabilities \u2014 mainly, those Federal Reserve Notes in your wallets. Feroli estimates that demand for U.S. currency has been growing by $100 billion a year recently. The Fed will most likely move to offset this heightened demand by adding assets, he said, but that\u2019s hardly QE. After all, the central bank did precisely the same thing for most years between 1914 and 2007.\n\nBank of America Corp. strategists predict the Fed will be even more aggressive. \u201cIt is important to make the distinction: this is not a return to quantitative easing,\u201d they said in prefacing their estimates. They say the central bank will need to purchase about $150 billion of assets a year because of the demand for its liabilities. On top of that, \u201cto avoid a repeat of recent funding pressures and a return to an \u2018abundant\u2019 reserve level plus a buffer, we think the Fed most likely will need to purchase an additional $250 billion.\u201d\n\nThis is not some Wall Street ploy to play down the significance of the Fed resuming balance-sheet growth. The Fed is clear on its website about how it needs to engage in open-market operations to counter the growth in its liabilities:\n\nThe quantity of Federal Reserve notes held by the public has grown over time. Absent any additional action by the Federal Reserve, the increase in Federal Reserve notes would reduce the quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions and push the federal funds rate above the target set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). To prevent that outcome, the Federal Reserve engages in open market operations to offset the reduction in reserve balances.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened last week, when the effective fed funds rate rose to 2.3%, higher than the stated 2.25% upper bound. The Fed\u2019s go-to preventive measure, as it always has been, is precisely the sort of asset purchases that Powell was describing.\n\nFormer New York Fed President Bill Dudley, writing for Bloomberg Opinion, said the Fed could focus on adding short-term obligations like Treasury bills to make abundantly clear that its plan is different from post-crisis QE. Joseph Abate at Barclays Plc sees similar benefits to buying bills \u2014 it would serve to \u201cavoid any confusion with QE and to emphasize that these purchases are \u2018reserve management operations,\u2019\u201d he wrote.\n\nAt NatWest Markets, strategists went even further, differentiating between buying assets to offset currency growth and a sort of \u201cQE-lite\u201d program. Organic growth \u201cseems to suggest offsetting currency growth, and not using the balance sheet to relieve stress in funding markets,\u201d they wrote in a Sept. 20 note. \u201cIt\u2019s possible a QE-lite style program could exist in the future, but we do not think the Fed is ready to commit to anything like that at this time. Given the recent funding pressures, we see the Fed as being content with coming in and conducting temporary repo operations.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- \u201cDon\u2019t Call It QE.\u201dWith that\u00a0four-word title, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s\u00a0chief U.S. economist, Michael Feroli, effectively summed up Wall Street\u2019s reaction to the weeklong stress in funding markets and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments about how he and other policy makers", "authors": ["Brian Chappatta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FWjpuKuoKJ1ySoXEscKjNw--~B/aD03MzY7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_opinion_268/19318b675174fa89fbfcab481c411c00", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
