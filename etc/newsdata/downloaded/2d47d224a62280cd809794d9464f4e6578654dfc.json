Consider, for example, Elon Musk\u2019s obsession with transporting humans to Mars. The astronaut Buzz Aldrin told CNBC this week that Musk\u2019s plan may be well-funded, but it\u2019s not very well thought out\u2014and that cheaper technology isn\u2019t necessarily better. \u201cWe went to the moon on government-designed rockets,\u201d Aldrin said.\n\nEven if Musk\u2019s investment in SpaceX does represent a world-changing scientific effort\u2014it\u2019s not enough by itself.\n\n\u201cFunding like the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative is fantastic and will be transformative for Bay Area Science,\u201d said Katherine Pollard, a professor at the UCSF School of Medicine and a Chan Zuckerberg Biohub researcher who studies the human microbiome. \u201cBut the scope and size of even a large gift like this one cannot come close to replacing publicly supported science.\u201d The unrestricted research funding she\u2019s getting as part of her work with the Chan Zuckerberg program is \u201cstill only 10 percent of what it costs to run my lab,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd what happens to all the crucial basic science without billionaire backing\u2014the kind of research with wide-ranging applications that can dramatically enhance human understanding of the world? NIH funding is spread across all disciplines, several scientists reminded me, whereas private funding tends to be driven by the personal preferences of investors.\n\nPlus, scientific work is rarely profitable on a timescale that delights investors. The tension between making money and making research strides can result in projects being abandoned altogether or pushed forward before they\u2019re ready. Just look at Theranos, the blood-testing company that was once a Silicon Valley darling. As The Wall Street Journal reported last year, even when the company\u2019s technology hadn\u2019t progressed beyond lab research, its CEO was downplaying the severity of her company\u2019s myriad problems\u2014both internally and to investors. Its fall from grace\u2014and from a $9 billion valuation\u2014is a stunning and instructive illustration of where private and public interests in scientific research can clash.\n\nBut also, in a privately-funded system, investor interest dictates the kind of science that\u2019s pursued in the first place.\n\n\u201cPut simply, privatization will mean that more \u2018sexy,\u2019 \u2018hot\u2019 science will be funded, and we will miss important discoveries since most breakthroughs are based on years and decades of baby steps,\u201d said Kelly Cosgrove, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University. \u201cThe hare will win, the tortoise will lose, and America will not be scientifically great.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s enduring scientific greatness rests largely on the scientists of the future. And relying on private funding poses an additional problem for supporting people early in their careers. The squeeze on public funding in recent years has posed a similar concern, as young scientists are getting a smaller share of key publicly-funded research grants, according to a 2014 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1983, about 18 percent of scientists who received the NIH\u2019s leading research grant were 36 years old or younger. In 2010, just 3 percent of them were. Today, more than twice as many such grants go to scientists who are over 65 years old compared with people under 36\u2014a reversal from just 15 years ago, according to the report.", "description": "Private funding isn't enough to offset the president's proposed budget cuts, they say.", "authors": ["Adrienne Lafrance"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/03/RTX1119Q/facebook.jpg?1522778022"}
