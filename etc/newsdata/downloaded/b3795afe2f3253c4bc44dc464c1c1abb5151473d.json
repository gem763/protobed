It depicts the biblical creation of Adam, the first man, from the book of Genesis\n\nJulia said: 'To me these photos are so human in their true love and care, multitasking and resourcefulness. They're not only beautiful, they are very true in the emotions they convey.\n\n'The moment I saw the orangutan stretching it's hand to reach the hand of a boat skipper it gave me chills since it looked like a mix of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel and an alien hand.\n\n'We stopped and after a while she came out to the river bank. She was first quite suspicious of us but little by little she came out and she started drinking.\n\nThe photographer, Julia Wimmerlin, 42, said that the series of snaps show a humanity through their 'love and care' and that they convey 'true emotion'\n\nWimmerlin added that the orangutan was quite suspicious of the party at first but eventually came out to the river bank and started drinking from the water\n\nIt was the remnants of the group's breakfast that caused her to reach towards the boat. Wimmerlin said that the orangutan began to consider getting in the vessel towards the end\n\n'Attracted by the remnants of our breakfast she decided to reach the boat.\n\n'We could observe the whole process from her not being sure to trying to get into the water into reaching to the boat. At this moment we started throwing some of this food into water.\n\n'At the end when she was considering getting into the boat the boat skipper put his hand with food into the opposite direction.\n\n'The photos with the hands are the result of that.'\n\nOrangutans are the most intelligent non-human primates, having the ability to use tools and problem solve. It is also believed that they can communicate with each other linguistically", "description": "These mesmerising pictures, taken by photographer Julia Wimmerlin, 42, in Indonesia show a majestic orangutan recreating one of the most famous scenes in world art.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/00/20353998-0-image-a-36_1572396843011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
