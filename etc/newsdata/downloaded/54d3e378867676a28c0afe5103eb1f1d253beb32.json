Prices had gained about 0.2% in the week.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 dropped 0.1% to $1,496.20 per ounce.\n\nThe European Union backed a new Brexit deal with Britain on Thursday. This prompted an uptick in Asian shares with MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS up 0.1%.\n\n\u201cThe Brexit deal did not have as much a negative impact on gold as expected. This means that there are still concerns that it might not get passed in the parliament,\u201d said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.\n\nWhile markets cheered progress in talks, doubts erupt if Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be able to secure the UK parliament\u2019s backing for the agreement if he is to take Britain out of Europe on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cGold will be range-bound until and unless we have some clarity on Brexit and other geo-political risks,\u201d Lan said adding that he expects gold to trade around $1,475 and $1,503 per ounce in the short term.\n\nWorries surrounding a trade war between the United States and China still lingered, with China\u2019s economic growth slowing more than expected to 6% year-on-year in the third quarter, the weakest pace in almost three decades.\n\nBeijing hopes to reach a phased agreement and cancel tariffs as soon as possible, the Commerce Ministry said on Thursday, adding that trade wars had no winners.\n\nThe world\u2019s two-largest economies have imposed tariffs on each other\u2019s goods in a dispute over China\u2019s trade and industrial policies that has slammed the brakes on global economic growth. Gold is often used at such times as a hedge against uncertainty.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY at a near eight-week low has also lent support to the metal.\n\nANZ Bank said in a note it expects gold to receive support from elevated macro and geopolitical risks, with under-supplied PGM (platinum group metal) prices likely to push higher.\n\n\u201cThe palladium market is still structurally tight, keeping prices resilient with intermittent volatility.\u201d\n\nAmongst other precious metals, palladium XPD= was muted at around $1,758.91, a day after hitting a record high of $1,783.21 an ounce.
