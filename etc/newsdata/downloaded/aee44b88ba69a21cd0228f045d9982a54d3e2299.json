But then we closed,\" cafe owner Chris Westerbeek told local news station RTV Drenthe, which first reported the story.\n\nIn a later conversation, when the man came back on Sunday, \"he admitted that he had run away and that he needed help,\" Westerbeek said. \"Then, we called in the police.\"\n\n\"He said he had not been outside for nine years. Later, he also said that he had four brothers and one sister who lived on the farm. He was the oldest and wanted to put an end to the way they lived,\" Westerbeek told RTV.\n\nLocal mechanic Jeffrey Scheper who owns J. Scheper Autos, also met the young man in the caf\u00e9. Reached for comment by ABC News, he referred to a television interview he gave to Dutch television host Beau van Erven Dorens.\n\n\u201cWe tried to ask questions, among other things, because he said he had not been outside for nine years: is it a religion? A cult? He said yes, nothing more,\" Scheper said in the interview.\n\nOn Monday, the police acted on his complaint that the young man was \u201cworried about the living conditions of his family\u201d and visited the house on the Buitenhuizerweg.\n\nThere, they found people living in a small room on the ground floor. The family told the police that they were all over 18 years old, although the police are verifying the people\u2019s ages and their relationship to each other. They were taken into police care and were all seen by a doctor, the police said in a statement shared with ABC News.\n\nThe police say that it is unclear whether the family was living in the house voluntarily and how they came to be there.\n\nPiroschka Van De Wouw/Reuters\n\n\u201cWe understand that everyone still has many questions. We have those too,\u201d police said.\n\nOn Tuesday police arrested a 58-year-old man who is the only tenant of the farm. His role in the case is still being investigated, according to police, but he is currently suspected of \u201cbeing involved in illegal deprivation of liberty and prejudicing the health of others,\u201d according to the North Netherlands Public Prosecutor.\n\nPolice said he was arrested because he did not want to \u201ccooperate with our investigation.\u201d\n\n1/2 De 58-jarige man die dinsdag in Ruinerwold is aangehouden, wordt donderdag voorgeleid bij de rechter-commissaris. De man wordt op dit moment in het onderzoek verdacht van betrokkenheid bij wederrechtelijke vrijheidsberoving en het benadelen van de gezondheid van anderen. \u2014 OM Noord-Nederland (@OM_NoordNL) October 16, 2019\n\nThe man, identified as Josef B by RTV Drenthe, appeared in front of the examining magistrate on Thursday. The justice commissioner of the North Netherlands Court ordered that he be detained for 14 days \u201con suspicion of unlawful deprivation of liberty\u201d.\n\nDe rechter-commissaris van de rechtbank Noord-Nederland heeft zojuist de bewaring bevolen voor de duur van 14 dagen van een 58-jarige man op verdenking van wederrechtelijke vrijheidsberoving. De verdachte \u2013 die dinsdag werd aangehouden in Ruinerwold - zit in beperkingen. \u2014 OM Noord-Nederland (@OM_NoordNL) October 17, 2019\n\n\"I have never come across anything like this before,\" said Roger de Groot the mayor of Ruinerwold at a press conference.\n\nOn Thursday, police said -- without any further explanation -- that they had expanded their investigation to other locations in northern Holland.\n\nLocal man Frank Wijers, who works at the garage just beside the caf\u00e9, told ABC News that the story was the talk of the town. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange story,\u201d he said, \u201cQuite a shock!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very pleasant community here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you participate in public life, it\u2019s alright. But if you don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s alright too. People leave you alone.\u201d", "description": "Man arrested in connection with family of seven living unknown in Dutch farmhouse now sentenced to 14-day detention", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/netherlands-family3-gty-ml-191017_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
