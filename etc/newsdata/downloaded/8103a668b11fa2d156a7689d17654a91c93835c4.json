And learn that Romanowski sympathizes with Burfict after he was suspended the rest of the season for assaulting Doyle. And OK, of course. That all makes sense.\n\nThat the dirtiest player of his generation feels a kindred spirit with the reigning champion of wanton, reckless, irresponsibly violent football should come as no surprise.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRomanowski: Burfict \u2018has cleaned up his act\u2019\n\nRomanowski delivered an impassioned defense of Burfict on Tuesday while explaining to TMZ that \u201cyou have no idea how many times I did that in my career.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou're in the heat of battle,\u201d Romanowski said. \u201cYour mindset is kill or be killed. Because the offensive linemen are still coming at you. You're in war. You're supposed to be able to be violent sometimes and other times you're supposed be able to just take your foot off the gas like that. That is hard, my friend. \u201cI feel for this guy. Do I think he should be fined? Yes. Do I think he should be kicked out of the league? No. I think it is absolutely dead wrong. This guy has handled himself like a pro. And yes, he is a violent mother f\u2019er, and I love the way he plays the game of football. I truly believe this guy has cleaned up his act.\u201d\n\nRomanowski went on to say that Burfict \u201cplays the game the way it\u2019s supposed to be played\u201d while calling his suspension \u201cbulls---.\u201d\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nHaving Bill Romanowski in his corner doesn't help Vontaze Burfict's case. (Getty)\n\nRomanowski\u2019s dirty, violent career\n\nIn case you\u2019ve forgotten or aren\u2019t familiar with Romanowski\u2019s credentials, here\u2019s a brief snippet.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nStory continues\n\nThe former Raiders, Broncos, Eagles and 49ers linebacker broke Kerry Collins\u2019 jaw with an illegal helmet-to-helmet hit in 1997. He spit in the face of 49ers receiver J.J. Stokes the same year. He ended the career of Raiders tight end and teammate Marcus Williams when he ripped his helmet off in practice and broke his eye socket with a punch to the face in 2003.\n\nThat\u2019s just a small sampling of Romanowski\u2019s greatest hits.\n\nThis is Burfict\u2019s ally.\n\nIn defending Burfict, Romanowski is only strengthening the case that the Raiders linebacker doesn\u2019t belong in the league.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJason Owens is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
