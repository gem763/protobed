We learned from this, we should have learned from that over the past week, with some of the people who have been cited.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to be better in that area.\u201d\n\nWorld Cup referees had come under intense scrutiny over the opening weekend with coaches, fans and pundits all complaining about the inconsistency of the decision making.\n\nThe most controversial involved Australia\u2019s Reece Hodge, who will face a judiciary hearing on Wednesday after he was cited for a dangerous tackle on Fiji loose forward Peceli Yato.\n\nHodge initially escaped any on-field sanction after the referee Ben O\u2019Keeffe and TMO Rowan Kitt reviewed the incident and ruled there was no foul play.\n\nThe winger, however, was cited on Sunday, which prompted a critical response from Australia coach Michael Cheika who argued the 25-year-old had been the victim of circumstance.\n\n\u201cI think if you see the conjecture around the place, the majority of footballers, former rugby players who have played the game, said it was not illegal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s really simple, show the vision, look at the conditions and the different mitigating circumstances across the whole incident and see what it is.\n\n\u201cAnd what it is, is a guy\u2019s trying to make a tackle, and it\u2019s pretty clear.\u201d", "description": "Samoa were lucky not to finish their World Cup Pool A opener with just 13 men on the field as Rey Lee-lo and Motu Matu'u deserved red cards, Russia coach Lyn Jones said.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433386035&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1DV", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
