Photo: The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nWe can now make an educated guess that President Trump probably knew the jig was up when he appeared on the White House lawn Thursday morning and announced that he wants Ukraine and China to investigate his leading political rival. This brazen presidential advertisement for more foreign interference took place as the House Intelligence Committee was receiving a batch of text messages recording for posterity that the administration\u2019s Ukraine policy was predicated on trading a presidential visit and military aid for the investigations Trump wanted.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t know by then, Trump almost certainly knew it at 9:00 p.m. that night, when he tweeted out his bottom-line position: He has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to push foreign countries to investigate anybody he desires, for any reason.\n\nAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nAfter a couple weeks of conservatives furiously throwing up every distraction they could imagine \u2014 insisting the issue was whistle-blower form had been changed, or that the House hadn\u2019t properly voted to begin impeachment proceedings, or that Adam Schiff had paraphrased Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 we have gotten down to the issue at hand. Either Trump has lost all patience for his allies\u2019 inscrutable evasions, or he has seen where the debate is going and is leading his party to the destination. Trump is claiming the absolute right to demand investigations of any American by any country.\n\nThe president exerts unilateral control over the most powerful government on Earth. He is announcing to every foreign state that American relations with his government \u2014 and, should he prevail, every future government \u2014 can and will be influenced by their willingness to put their judicial or quasi-judicial systems at the disposal of his reelection campaign.\n\nIt is almost impossible to imagine such a power could be used properly, even in a theoretical world in which the president was absolutely ethical and completely devoid of any political interest. Presidents don\u2019t get to decide which American citizens are subject to criminal investigations here \u2014 why can they make such determinations for other countries\u2019 legal systems?\n\nIn any case, even such an obviously problematic hypothetical has no bearing on the situation at hand. The pretext that somehow Trump is advancing the cause of good government by demanding international anti-corruption probes is a morbid joke. First, he is not making this demand of countries with open and fair legal systems that can be counted on to deliver reliable findings. He is not asking Canada or France. He is pressing notoriously corrupt states to deliver a predetermined outcome. For Ukraine or China to quietly investigate his charges and then announce Joe Biden did nothing wrong would be of zero or negative value to him. The favor he is bartering for is the insinuation of guilt.\n\nAnd Trump himself is obviously indulging in corruption on a scale unprecedented in presidential history. No modern president has ever refused to disclose his tax returns, and no president in history has operated a global business empire while running the presidency. The entire corruption narrative he is driving about Biden is upside down. For all of Hunter Biden\u2019s sleazy trading on his father\u2019s name, Joe Biden\u2019s intervention in Ukraine came down firmly on the side of reform. Trump and his camp allied themselves with the most corrupt elements of the Ukrainian polity, some of whom saw in Trump\u2019s mania as a chance to gain American favor that would enhance their own internal power.\n\nTrump is currently collecting payments at his properties from interested parties, domestically and internationally. His own children have struck business deals in China \u2014 a clear conflict of interest \u2014 even as Trump demands probes of Biden\u2019s son for the same alleged sin, with no evidence.\n\nHis demands are not intended to clamp down on corruption, but to cheapen the currency of the language, so that he can more easily dismiss his own gross behavior as standard procedure. Either consciously or by instinct, Trump is emulating the foreign despots he admires, like Mohammed bin Salman, who have used the pretext of anti-corruption to discredit their rivals and consolidate their own rackets.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to imagine the possibilities for abuse this power invites. Trump is already exploring something close to the worst-case scenario right now, out in the open. Trump has started a trade war costing China hundreds of billions of dollars, and he is telling his partners that they can bid down the cost of a settlement by coughing up some political dirt. \u201cOne Trump ally outside the White House described receiving a message from Chinese government officials asking if Trump was serious when he suggested China open an investigation into Biden,\u201d reports CNN, \u201cThe response: Investigating corruption is an easy way to earn goodwill with Trump.\u201d Of course, the unstated coda is that the \u201ccorruption\u201d needs to involve Trump\u2019s opponents, not his own family.\n\nTrump may be bearing a significant political price for his machinations, but they are already bearing fruit. He is being rewarded with headlines like this, from the New York Times \u2014 \u201cUkraine to Review Criminal Case of Firm Linked to Biden\u2019s Son\u201d \u2014 which deliciously combine terms like \u201cBiden,\u201d \u201ccriminal,\u201d and \u201clinked,\u201d and inject them into the political bloodstream. If he can bear the political cost of the backlash, he has 13 more months to reap the publicity benefits from any of the 193-odd U.N. member states that would like to seize the opportunity to gain Trump\u2019s favor.\n\nThis is an ongoing strategy Trump\u2019s partisans are already lining up to endorse. Asked if he approves of Trump\u2019s call for foreign investigations of Biden, Vice-President Mike Pence told reporters that he does. \u201cI think the American people have a right to know if the vice-president of the United States or his family profited from this position as vice-president during the last administration. That\u2019s about looking backwards and understanding what really happened,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd the president made it very clear that he believes \u2014 he believes our other nations around the world should look into it as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s potential criminal activity, the president of the United States is our chief law enforcement officer,\u201d says Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), assigning the president new powers to demand global investigations by whim. Conn Carroll, spokesman for Senator Mike Lee, asks, \u201cSo when did asking Ukraine to investigate Burisma for corruption become an impeachable offense exactly?\u201d \u2014 as if everybody has always accepted the president\u2019s right to tell foreign countries to investigate officials from the out-party. As the narrow legalistic defenses of Trump\u2019s behavior collapse one by one, and the mountain of proof grows higher that U.S.-Ukraine policy was built around conditioning the relationship on the investigations, Trump loyalists will find no other place to stand.\n\nThe clutter has been cleared away and everybody faces the brutally simple choice that Trump presents. Either they hand the president the absolute right, now and forever, to use American foreign policy as a lever to discredit their political rivals, or they vote to impeach.\n\nThis column has been updated.", "description": "President Trump probably suspected his \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d defense was collapsing when he announced he can and will ask foreign countries to investigate his rivals.
