Stride officials say she will start in February.\n\nMorris was fired from St. Anthony Hospital in August after she and a patient filed a legal case challenging Centura Health\u2019s policy against physician aid-in-dying. Centura was formed by Catholic and Seventh-day Adventist health care ministries.\n\nColorado voters legalized physician aid-in-dying in 2016. The law forbids limiting a physican\u2019s medical judgment on the issue, but the hospitals argue Colorado law can\u2019t interfere with a religious organization carrying out its mission.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Denver Post, http://www.denverpost.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Colorado doctor fired by a Christian hospital company after trying to help a terminally ill man obtain drugs to hasten his death has a new job with a community health center.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
