The new destination, called World\u2019s Edge, is \u201cwhere molten heat and chemical ice collide,\u201d indicating players will be facing off in an extreme temperature environment.\n\nIn a teaser trailer for the map, we can see both icy and lava-filled battlefields. In a twist on the existing drop ship, there is also a moving train, which should add a very interesting mobile element to World\u2019s Edge. Respawn says the location, alongside its new legend Crypto, will be arriving with season three next week on October 1st.\n\nBeyond the news of a new arena to compete in, the reveal of a secondary Apex Legends map also highlights a shift in strategy for Respawn. Although the studio may have been planning a second map for quite some time, it had never openly talked about whether Apex Legends would be modeled more like Playerunknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, which features multiple maps in rotation, or Epic\u2019s Fortnite, which has one constantly changing setting. (There are some rumors Fortnite may shake up that formula with its upcoming season 11.)\n\nNow, with the World\u2019s Edge reveal, it\u2019s pretty clear Respawn is taking the former approach. And that\u2019s probably a good thing. Apex Legends is at its core a competitive first-person shooter, and it relies less on the environmental storytelling that has made Fortnite so appealing to players both hardcore and casual. So it\u2019s less necessary for Respawn to build out a single, ever-evolving location and more imperative the studio give players dynamic arenas to fight in.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping Respawn comes up with clever ways to keep both maps fresh and popular simultaneously, which can be a struggle if World\u2019s Edge proves far more fun than the game\u2019s initial Kings Canyon location.", "description": "Respawn made a bombshell announcement for its Apex Legends battle royale shooter this morning, revealing a brand-new map for its upcoming third season.
