Other gifts totaled about $2.4m. Epstein did not attend Harvard.\n\nEpstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August after being arrested on sex trafficking charges of young women and girls. His arrest triggered a national examination of his position in an elite social circle of rich, powerful people across the arts, sciences and politics.\n\nIn a message to Harvard students and staff, Bacow, who took over as president in June, condemned Epstein crimes as \u201crepulsive and reprehensible\u201d and said he \u201cprofoundly regrets Harvard\u2019s past association with him\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cEpstein\u2019s behavior, not just at Harvard, but elsewhere, raises significant questions about how institutions like ours review and vet donors.\u201d\n\nAfter a review of Harvard\u2019s relationship with Epstein ordered two weeks ago, Bacow said the university still had $186,000 in funds from the earlier donations, which will now be given to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault.\n\nHarvard\u2019s disclosure comes a day after the university\u2019s newspaper, the Harvard Crimson, condemned the school for what it called a \u201cdeafening silence\u201d on the matter.\n\n\u201cHarvard must further recognize that accepting a donation at a given point in time not only legitimates the donor\u2019s reputation, but also implicitly condones what they stand for in perpetuity, unless the university takes clear, decisive action to demonstrate the contrary,\u201d the Crimson\u2019s editorial board wrote.\n\nThe disclosure that Harvard declined Epstein\u2019s contributions after he was convicted for soliciting a minor are in marked contrast to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and its Media Lab, which has been rocked by revelations that it accepted more than $7.5m in donations from Epstein or people connected to the university through him after his conviction.\n\nAmid a review of Epstein donations to MIT, the university\u2019s president, Rafael Reif, acknowledged Thursday he apparently thanked Epstein in a note in 2012 in response to one donation.\n\nBacow, in his message, also noted that Harvard had recently learned that Stephen Kosslyn, a former faculty member and a beneficiary of Epstein\u2019s philanthropy, had designated Epstein as a visiting fellow in the psychology department in 2005.\n\n\u201cWe are seeking to learn more about the nature of that appointment from Dr Kosslyn, who no longer works at the university,\u201d Bacow said.", "description": "University rejected proposed gift after his conviction, president says, while the largest was $6.5m for the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715bd29e54ad6b80708c51bf151c73aefc89b3d8/0_82_1167_699/master/1167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=664412cb5484556e759bd18f29732820", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
