Union members are calling for fair wages, saying for every $1 a GM employee made, CEO Mary Barra made $281.\n\nThe strike comes nearly a year after GM announced it was laying off 15 percent of its salaried workers and shuttering five plants in North America.\n\nBill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nLast week, Barra met with union negotiators for the first time. Shortly after the UAW put out a statement accusing GM of attempting to \"undermine the ongoing, good-faith efforts the UAW has made to end this strike.\"\n\nGM has argued that the offer it presented to UAW workers \"prioritizes employees, communities and builds a stronger future for all.\"\n\n\"It includes improved wages and health care benefits, over $7B in U.S. investments and 5,400 jobs,\" the company said in a tweet.", "description": "As the United Auto Workers strike at General Motors enters its fifth week, union leaders voted to increase striking workers pay and allow them to take part-time jobs.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/uaw-strike-02-gty-jt-191014_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
