She had been detained for dressing as a man to enter a soccer stadium in Tehran and faced six months in prison.\n\n\u201cThere is women\u2019s football in Iran but we need Iranian women as well to be able to attend the men\u2019s game,\u201d FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a speech at a conference on women\u2019s football on Sunday. \u201cAnd we need to push for that with respect but in a strong and forceful way. We cannot wait anymore.\n\n\u201cWe have been assured, that as of the next international game of Iran, women will be allowed to enter football stadiums. This is something very important, it is 40 years that this has not happened, with a couple of exceptions, but it is important to move to the next level and to the next stage.\u201d\n\nFIFA sent an inspection team to Iran this week to meet government and soccer officials ahead of Iran\u2019s match against Cambodia at the 78,000-capacity Azadi Stadium on Oct. 10 - its first home match of the 2022 qualifying competition.\n\nInfantino\u2019s comments drew praise from United States outgoing coach Jill Ellis, who was at the same FIFA conference in Milan, two months after leading the American women\u2019s team to a second successive World Cup title.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s huge,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cFIFA has enough of a pull and ability to influence change and I think it\u2019s absolutely the right thing. I mean I don\u2019t think there should be any discrimination period and to not allow women to go see football I think is, I just can\u2019t even wrap my brain around it in terms of it being something. I think if FIFA can influence that, I think it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "FIFA has been \"assured\" that Iran will lift its 40-year ban and allow women to attend a World Cup qualifying game next month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Daniella Matar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/fifa_iran_women_in_stadiums_69259_c0-98-2360-1474_s1770x1032.jpg?37dda99b9bad4e716311d3c9837b8d4608302cd8", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
