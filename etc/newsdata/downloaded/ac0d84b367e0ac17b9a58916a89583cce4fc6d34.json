There is a problem though: we have to make the film. We\u2019ve run out of room, in a sense; there was no room for us to make this picture, for many reasons. [But] having the backing of a company that says that you will have no interference, you can make the picture as you want \u2013 the trade-off being: it streams, with theatrical distribution prior to that. I figure, that\u2019s a chance we take, on this particular project.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Irishman. Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe Irishman, which tells the story of real-life mafia hitman Frank Sheeran (played by De Niro) who is suspected of befriending and killing celebrated union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) in 1975, was acquired by Netflix in 2017 after its previous backers Paramount and STX dropped out in 2017. It is thought the studios got cold feet after the cost of pioneering \u201cde-aging\u201d CGI, used to make the central characters appear younger in extensive flashback scenes, caused the budget to balloon to a rumoured $200m, as well as the disappointing returns for Scorsese\u2019s previous film, the martyrdom drama Silence.\n\nHowever, Netflix have incurred the wrath of other sectors of the film industry which are committed to defending the cinema experience. Several major US chains, including AMC and Regal, and two UK chains (Vue and Picturehouses) are likely to refuse to screen the film, as part of a long-running boycott of the streaming giant and its failure to respect the cinemas\u2019 traditional 90-day window of exclusivity. Netflix has also been excluded from the Cannes film festival for the last two years (due to France\u2019s even more stringent rules), while Scorsese\u2019s fellow director Steven Spielberg is recently thought to have suggested that their films should not be eligible for Oscars. Partly to compensate for its limited presence in cinemas, The Irishman will screen for a month at New York\u2019s historic Belasco theatre on Broadway.\n\nThe Irishman review: Martin Scorsese's finest film for 30 years Read more\n\nScorsese also renewed his criticism of \u201cMarvel-type pictures\u201d, repeating his assertion they were \u201cnot cinema\u201d. They are \u201ctheme-park films\u201d, he said, \u201cwhere theatres become amusement parks\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a different experience: it\u2019s not cinema, its something else, and whether you [like] them or not we shouldn\u2019t be invaded by it. That\u2019s a big issue and we need theatre owners to step up, to allow theatres to show films that are narrative films.\u201d Directors James Gunn and Joss Whedon, and actor Samuel L Jackson defended Marvel, after Scorsese first broached the subject in a magazine interview earlier in October.\n\nThe director also expressed doubts that longform TV would replace the filmgoing experience. \u201cI thought for a while that long form TV was going to be cinema, but it\u2019s not. It simply isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a different viewing experience: you can go to episode 3, 4, then 10; one one week, another the next \u2013 it\u2019s a different kind of thing. What\u2019s got to be protected is the singular experience, ideally with an audience.\u201d\n\nThe Irishman is released on 1 November in the US and 8 November in the UK, before being avaialble on Netflix on 27 November.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Director says no one else in Hollywood would back his new film The Irishman after costs soared due to pioneering \u2018de-aging\u2019 technology", "authors": ["Andrew Pulver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50496631db55ebb2924ddad1d143e66b1eb58bcb/0_37_3185_1912/master/3185.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=59f5903a30272570d754fb900d10072f", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
