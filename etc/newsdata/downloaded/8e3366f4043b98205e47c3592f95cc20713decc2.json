Claure, the new executive chairman at WeWork, defends giving large payouts to founder Adam Neumann\n\nAdam Neumann, founder of office-sharing company WeWork, is getting a large sum as part of SoftBank Group taking control\n\nThe layoffs will amount to just under one-third of their global workforce. The report adds that 1,000 of the cuts will impact janitorial staff, among other employees.\n\nWeWork is closing or selling a number of businesses outside of the main office-sharing operations. It recently announced it would close the WeGrow private school in New York City after the current school year.\n\nUntil Tuesday's takeover deal, Neumann remained WeWork's chairman and largest individual shareholder, with special voting rights that gave him total control over the company.\n\nSoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son on November 2018. His company injected $9.5billion into WeWork\n\nSoftBank's package to induce Neumann to cede control reportedly included a $1 billion stock buyout, $500 million line of credit, and $185 million 'consulting fee.'\n\nSoftBank will spend an additional $2 billion to cash out other WeWork investors and employees of their equity in the company \u2014 an amount that is far from the payday that staff had dreamed of when the company announced plans for its now-cancelled IPO in August.\n\nThe deal values the company at $8 billion, down from the $47 billion that SoftBank's January investment pegged the company at.\n\nNeumann and his wife, Rebekah, call Son 'Yoda,' a reference to the Star Wars character\n\nThe CEO of the Japanese tech conglomerate Masayoshi Son, 62, is the mastermind of SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund.\n\nThough he lost an estimated $70 billion in the dot-com crash, Son remains the second richest man in Japan, with an estimated net worth of $19 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n'Companies like WeWork and Uber are criticized for being in the red, but in 10 years they'll be making substantial profits,' Son said.\n\nClaure said that the new cash injection meant WeWork was not going to struggle to survive.\n\nHe told the employees in a meeting at the company's New York headquarters he did not know how many layoffs would take place as WeWork looks to 'go back to basics.'", "description": "WeWork defends payouts for founder Adam Neumann.
