Tens of thousands of people have been left homeless.\n\nThe tweet was just in the latest in Trump\u2019s relentless, weeklong Twitter broadsides against the media for its coverage of his false claims last Sunday that Alabama was in the storm\u2019s path.\n\nThat day, Trump claimed on Twitter that Alabama would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d despite official reports that stated otherwise. Trump then told reporters that it looked like Alabama would \u201cget a piece\u201d of the storm.\n\nAt the time, National Weather Service\u2019s (NWS) projections had Alabama in the clear as Dorian curved northward off the East Coast.\n\nBut even after the NWS station in Birmingham quickly refuted Trump\u2019s claim, the president refused to concede he was wrong about the forecast. (The NOAA, parent organization of the NWS, faced blowback from meteorologists when it later disavowed the Birmingham correction.)\n\nThe controversy reached new heights last Wednesday, when Trump displayed to reporters a map that appeared to have been altered with a black marker to include Alabama in the hurricane\u2019s path.\n\nPresident Trump references a map held by acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan while talking to reporters following a briefing from officials about Hurricane Dorian.
