The company also removed BackupHK, a separate app that served as a mirror of the HKmap.live app.\n\n\n\n\n\n'PRESSURE'\n\nMaya Wang, a senior China researcher with Human Rights Watch, said there could be legitimate concerns of misuse of apps but that the statement from Apple was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d because it did not make any reference to pressure from Beijing in the People's Daily commentary.\n\n\u201cGiven the context of how (Apple) has over the years removed apps and removed access to news particularly inside mainland China that the Chinese government doesn\u2019t want, I think that the removal of this particular app strikes me as another shameful incident in which a multinational company bends to Chinese government pressure,\" she said.\n\nRepublican U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn said, \"Apple and American companies should not fold to a communist regime\u2019s demands to shut down democracy activists.\"\n\nCook, in a letter to company workers, said it was a difficult decision.\n\n\"National and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts,\" he said. The app was being used maliciously to target individual police officers and to victimize individuals and property, and so was in violation of Hong Kong law, he said.\n\nOn Twitter, an account believed to be owned by the HKmap.live app's developer said it disagreed with Apple's decision and that there was no evidence to support the Hong Kong police's claims that the app had been used in ambushes.\n\n\"The majority of user review(s) in App Store ... suggest HKmap IMPROVED public safety, not the opposite,\" it said.\n\nThe app consolidates content from public posts on social networks and moderators delete content that solicits criminal activity and would ban repeated attempts to post such content in the app, it added.\n\nNeither China's foreign ministry nor the information office of the State Council had an immediate comment when asked about the HKmap.live app removal. Hong Kong police also had no immediate comment.\n\nSeparately, Apple removed the Quartz news app from its App Store in China because authorities said it violated local laws.\n\nQuartz Chief Executive Zach Seward told technology publication The Verge in a statement: \"We abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet, and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world.\"\n\nA Google spokesman said \"The Revolution Of Our Times\" app recently pulled from its app store, which lets users role play as Hong Kong protesters, violated a long-standing policy \"prohibiting developers from capitalizing on sensitive events, such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Apple Inc has removed an app that helped Hong Kong protesters track police movements, saying it was used to target officers, after a Chinese state newspaper sharply criticized the U.S. tech giant for allowing the software.
