Macy, was the first of more than 30 parents sentenced in an elaborate and wide-ranging scam to help children of the elite secure places in top US colleges.\n\nFelicity was also fined $30 000 and pleaded guilty in May during a tearful court appearance to paying $15 000 to boost her daughter's SAT college entrance exam score.\n\nCompiled by Herman Eloff.", "description": "Felicity Huffman was released from prison after spending 11 days behind bars for her role in a college admissions scam.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4701/8ebb4e91a748443a8f16ae24530a6f51.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
