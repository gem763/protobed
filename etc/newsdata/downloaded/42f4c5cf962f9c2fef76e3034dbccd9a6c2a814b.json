And I'm sure the longer it goes it will get better.\n\n'If you are going to wear the number 9 shirt he's got to chip in with a few goals. He can only improve.'", "description": "Newcastle are to 'encourage' Joelinton (left) to bring some of his family over to England to help him settle as Steve Bruce looks to find a solution to the striker's poor start to life in the north east.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/07/20314276-0-image-a-6_1572334500178.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
