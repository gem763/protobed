Biden; Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California; Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont; billionaire activist Tom Steyer; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nTwelve candidates are set to participate in next week\u2019s debate in Ohio. The four additional candidates are former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
