The August gain in was the smallest in six months.\n\nYesterday was one such day when the nation\u2019s two largest consumer companies released their earnings. Let\u2019s find out how they\u2019re performing in this uncertain economic environment.\n\nCostco \u2014 Losing Some Steam?\n\nCostco price chart\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ: ) reported its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter yesterday, publishing numbers that fell short of estimates as the U.S. sales slightly missed analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nSame-store sales in the U.S., excluding gas, still rose robust 5.2% in the quarter, falling just short of analysts\u2019 projections compiled by Consensus Metrix. Earnings per share were $2.47, below the average estimate of $2.54.\n\nCostco stock fell as much as 3.5% in after-hours trading before paring some of the losses. It stock had gained 42% through Thursday\u2019s close, compared to the 16% increase in the .\n\nAccording to the U.S.-based consulting firm, AlixPartners, holiday sales are expected to rise between 4.4% and 5.3% compared with last year.\n\n\u201cWhile our 2019 forecast is an upswing from last year, tariffs and the trade war are finally beginning to take a hit on consumer confidence, and the buzz of an oncoming recession is getting louder,\u201d the firm said in a research report.\n\nSo far, however, shares of Costco have remained an investor favorite. The stock closed at $289 on Thursday, up more than 40% thus far this year.\n\nPepsi Shows Growth Despite Rising Prices\n\nSnack and beverage giant PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ: ) continued its strong growth momentum as consumers didn\u2019t put a brake on their purchases despite the soda-maker raising prices for its products.\n\nPepsi it will meet or exceed its full-year revenue growth after sales and profit both topped Wall Street estimates for last quarter.\n\nThe group said organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions and currency impacts, rose 4.3% from a year earlier in its fiscal third quarter ending in early September. For the full fiscal year, the company now says it may exceed its earlier target of 4% organic growth.\n\nPepsi price chart\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, the company\u2019s chief financial officer Hugh Johnston said his company didn\u2019t see any sign that consumers curtailing their spending on their products.\n\nYesterday\u2019s report provided additional evidence that Pepsi\u2019s sales momentum is backed by a strong demand revival and the success of the company\u2019s product mix which includes such popular brands as Frito-Lay, Tostitos and Ruffles brand chips.\n\nThe positive earnings surprise pushed Pepsi shares up 3% to $137.93 yesterday, adding to 25% gains the cola giant posted this year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nConsumer spending remains one of the strongest pillars of the U.S. economic expansion.
