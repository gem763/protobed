During Andy Cohen\u2019s Watch What Happens Live, Ruffin was asked by a caller about the time she auditioned for the NBC sketch-comedy show \u2014 more specifically, what went wrong during her audition. \u201cHow did I mess up getting into SNL? Uh, I wasn\u2019t good enough?\u201d Ruffin jokes. \u201cNo, I did great. I was up against people who, in the time since our audition, have become legends. And I\u2019m lucky that they\u2019re all my li\u2019l buddies now.\u201d While Ruffin didn\u2019t land the job, she says she did learn a very important lesson from the whole experience: \u201cBut what went wrong? I was myself. And I think that\u2019s a good lesson: Never be yourself.\u201d Thankfully, things ended up working out just fine with her job on Late Night \u2014 in fact, things worked out so well that Ruffin now has her very own show coming to NBC\u2019s streaming platform called The Amber Ruffin Show.
