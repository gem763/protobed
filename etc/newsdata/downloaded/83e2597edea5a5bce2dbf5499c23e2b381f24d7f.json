In Friday\u2019s filing, the state claims members of the family have been siphoning off millions to their own bank accounts to lessen what the company could be required to pay out in a settlement.\n\n\u201cWhile the Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement, we refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.\n\n\u201cRecords from one financial institution alone have shown approximately $1 billion in wire transfers between the Sacklers, entities they control, and different financial institutions, including those that have funneled funds into Swiss bank accounts,\u201d she continued.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s filing, James\u2019 office asks the courts to subpoena documents from financial institutions that the Sackler family has done business with.\n\n\u201cIt is elementary, however, that how the Sacklers moved and tried to hide their money will be key evidence of the liability of all of the participants,\u201d the filing read.\n\nThe Sackler family has contested the thousands of legal actions against their company and continually denied any culpability for the opioid crisis, which claims more than 130 lives every day in the U.S., according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFriday\u2019s development comes just over a month before the massive case\u2019s federal trial is scheduled to begin in mid-October in Cleveland, Ohio.", "description": "The Sacklers, the family behind OxyContin, allegedly wired around a billion dollars to their own bank accounts while defending their role in the opioid c...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7c0ae82300001c05530c57.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
