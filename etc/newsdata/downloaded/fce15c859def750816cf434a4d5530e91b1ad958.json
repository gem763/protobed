Billboard ultimately pulled the hit from the country chart, claiming it didn't embody enough country music elements.\n\nOrville Peck is the stage name of an up-and-coming Canadian country star who wears a mask to hide his identity. He's been vocal in the press about his crossover from punk, and the desire for diversity within country music.\n\n\"There has always been people of color making country music, and there has always been queer cowboys and cowgirls, like K.D.
