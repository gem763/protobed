I don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Cavuto said on-air. \u201cShepard Smith, as I just said a few days ago on this very network, a decent human being, a heart as big as Texas.\u201d\n\n\u201cA better newsman you probably cannot find. Again, a bigger, more emotionally connected to humankind, you cannot find,\u201d Cavuto continued. \u201cSo Shepard, I don\u2019t know what the heck you\u2019re planning to do or where you go, but I just know you\u2019ll be great at doing it and you deserve the best that life has to offer. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m a little shell-shocked here, but I\u2019m gonna miss my buddy.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Shepard Smith, Fox News Anchor and Trump Critic, Steps Down\n\nAs he cut to John Roberts, Fox News\u2019 White House correspondent, for a segment on trade talks between the U.S. and China, Roberts, too, said he was surprised by Smith\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been trying to compile my thoughts too, Neil,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI walked out here to do the hit and suddenly got hit by a subway train. Holy mackerel.\u201d\n\nThroughout the day, Smith\u2019s colleagues wrote to commend the news anchor and send him well wishes.\n\n\u201cHard to imagine life here at 1211 [Avenue of the Americas] without Shep,\u201d Martha MacCallum, Fox News anchor, tweeted. \u201cHe is a friend to us all, a highly talented newsman, whose coverage all these years here is a great legacy. I\u2019ll miss you, Shep and wish you all the best.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Shepard Smith Praised by Sean Hannity, Al Roker and More on Surprise Fox News Exit: 'Best Anchor They Have'\n\nRoberts also tweeted shortly after, \u201cHe was part of the glue that held Fox together. He is a supreme pro who made us all better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said there is nobody better at breaking news than Shep Smith,\u201d Fox News host Sean Hannity, who has publicly clashed with Smith before, tweeted. \u201cHe has always done great things and I know he will continue to do so. Looking forward to seeing Shep crush it in whatever he does next.\u201d\n\nAdded Brit Hume, \u201cShep Smith has been there from the beginning and was the most talented breaking news anchor I ever saw. Fox News Channel will not be the same without him.\u201d\n\nRead original story Fox News On-Air Hosts at a Loss for Words Over Shepard Smith\u2019s Departure At TheWrap", "description": "Fox News hosts have been at a loss for words over their now former colleague Shepard Smith\u2019s departure from the network.In clips from various Fox News shows broadcast on Friday \u2014 the day Smith announced he was immediately stepping down as an anchor \u2014\u00a0on-air hosts and correspondents Neil Cavuto and John", "authors": ["J.
