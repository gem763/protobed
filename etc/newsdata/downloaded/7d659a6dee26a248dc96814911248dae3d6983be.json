However, opposition and rebel lawmakers have already been largely successful in their plans to frustrate Mr. Johnson\u2019s bid to get the U.K. to leave the EU by the end of next month come what may.\n\nLawmakers last week passed legislation that forces the government to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline if a deal isn\u2019t agreed with the EU by Oct. 19, Mr. Johnson has said he won\u2019t comply with that law. Parliament also rejected Mr. Johnson\u2019s bid to hold a general election in October.\n\nOn Wednesday, a panel of judges in Scotland\u2019s highest civil court ruled in favor of a group of 78 lawmakers and others who filed a complaint to block the suspension of Parliament after the move was announced in late August.\n\nWhile the suspending\u2014or \u201cproroguing\u201d\u2014of Parliament is a regular occurrence, a senior judge ruled that \u201cit would nevertheless be unlawful if its purpose was to stymie parliamentary scrutiny of the executive.\u201d\n\nThe ruling will now head to the U.K.\u2019s highest court, with a decision expected Tuesday. While awaiting the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Parliament\u2019s suspension until Oct. 14 stands.\n\nIn a statement, the government said the \u201cU.K. government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda. Proroguing Parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this.\u201d\n\nProrogation normally happens every year or so, when the government wants Parliament to start a new session so it can set out its legislative plans.\n\nThe prime minister must ask the monarch to prorogue Parliament, a request which is invariably granted prompting an ancient process that involves a clerk speaking Norman French and officials in pointy hats.\n\nUnlike the U.S., the U.K. doesn\u2019t have a codified constitution. It is extremely rare for a court to rule against the government on matters like prorogation that derive from the historical powers of the monarch. At the heart of the case in Scotland was whether the government had misdirected Queen Elizabeth II to suspend Parliament.\n\nThe Scottish judge, Lord Brodie, said that this particular suspension \u201cas a tactic to frustrate Parliament, could legitimately be established as unlawful.\u201d Last week, the High Court in London rejected a similar challenge by campaigners and an appeal in that case is also due to be heard on Tuesday by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson has placed her majesty in an awkward position by providing her with advice that proved to be unlawful,\u201d Joanna Cherry, a Scottish lawmaker who led the challenge, told the British Broadcasting Corp. Ms. Cherry called for the government to \u201crespect this ruling.\u201d\n\nWhen Parliament was suspended in the early hours of Tuesday morning, there were protests and scuffles among some lawmakers in the debating chamber. Lawmakers tried to hold the House of Commons Speaker down in his chair\u2014until the Speaker stands up, Parliament can\u2018t be suspended. Others waved signs displaying the word \u201cSilenced.\u201d\n\nThe complaint in the Scottish court was filed by lawmakers who largely back the U.K. remaining in the EU. While a majority of those who voted in the 2016 referendum on EU membership voted to quit the trade bloc, Scottish voters overwhelmingly opted to stay in.\n\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament for several weeks has been ruled unlawful by Scotland\u2019s highest civil court, a decision that shunts the issue to the U.K.\u2019s Supreme Court for a final ruling.", "authors": ["Max Colchester", "Max.Colchester Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106023/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
