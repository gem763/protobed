A Monday night party?\u201d\n\nYes, the Washington Redskins are back on primetime television as they continue to chase their first win of 2019. Here\u2019s everything you need to know before the game.\n\nOpponent: Chicago Bears (1-1)\n\nWhere: FedEx Field, Landover, Maryland\n\nWhen: Monday, Sept. 23, 8:20 p.m.\n\nTelevision: ESPN\n\nRadio: The Team 980, ESPN 630AM\n\nWhat to watch for:\n\n- The Redskins\u2019 defense wants to shore itself up after allowing more than 30 points to both the Eagles and the Cowboys. The answer could be Mitch Trubisky, Chicago\u2019s struggling quarterback who has only managed 4.8 yards per pass attempt through two games this year. Having defensive lineman Jonathan Allen back on the pass rush would make things easier for Washington to keep the Bears at bay. Allen is questionable with a knee injury, but he was a full participant in Saturday\u2019s practice and told reporters he will play.\n\n- Khalil Mack continues to live up to his reputation as one of the best defensive players in the NFL. Washington\u2019s whole offensive line must contend with him this week, not just right tackle Morgan Moses. \u201cThe good thing is he lines up on both sides, so we don\u2019t know which side he\u2019s going to be on, unfortunately,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cIf we did, we\u2019d put somebody over there and bang the heck out of him. We don\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\n- It\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d so the Redskins are likely to lose. Why? Since the 2008 season, Washington is 2-15 on Mondays, among the worst marks in the NFL. The Redskins last won one of these big primetime games in 2014 over the Dallas Cowboys. If they are embarrassed on ESPN again this week, the good news is they don\u2019t have another Monday night game the rest of the year.\n\n- Still no Jordan Reed: The tight end will miss his third straight game after suffering a concussion in the preseason. Vernon Davis and Jeremy Sprinkle again will be Washington\u2019s top tight ends.\n\nPre-game reading:\n\nIn theory, Mitch Trubisky is coming to town at exactly the right time for the #Redskins, @Matthew_Paras writes. https://t.co/hsx7HWPMFQ \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 20, 2019\n\n#Redskins safety Collins blasts his former GM https://t.co/7LOv5djYpf \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 19, 2019\n\n#Redskins QB Keenum trying to get eyes in the \u201cright place\u201d after missing receivers, by @Matthew_Paras https://t.co/jig2tpE1f1 \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 19, 2019\n\nAs the Daniel Jones era gets underway with the #Giants, Dwayne Haskins is still patiently waiting his turn with the #Redskins, by @Matthew_Paras https://t.co/EjLynKvgd2 \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 18, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
