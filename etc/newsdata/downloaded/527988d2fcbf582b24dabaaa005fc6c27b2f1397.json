Impeachment is devouring the news cycle like Gabriel Iglesias at an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet. So what did the Speaker have to say on the subject now that an \u201cofficial impeachment inquiry\u201d is moving forward in a \u201cjudicious but expeditious\u201d fashion?\n\nPelosi wants everyone to know that she takes no joy in this, you see. It makes her sad. But she\u2019s firm in her commitment to upholding her constitutional obligations. And what of suggestions that this could backfire in a big way and cost the Democrats their majority in the House next year. That\u2019s not even on her mind and it \u201cjust doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, in Texas to cap the most pivotal week in her tenure as the leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, said Saturday Democrats will push ahead with the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump regardless of any political consequences. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Pelosi said in the wrap-up event of a weekend festival for politicians and journalists. \u201cOur first responsibility is to the Constitution.\u201d Pelosi, a California Democrat who reclaimed the gavel in the House after her party captured the majority in the 2018 November elections, spoke just blocks away from the Texas Capitol at the festival put on by the Texas Tribune.\n\nThe Speaker is obviously saying what she knows she needs to say as an experienced politician. She realizes that her party has stepped out onto a tightrope now and the risks to their 2020 prospects are very real. While a couple of polls have shown a slim majority of voters may be open to considering impeachment, voters are still very cautious in general. If Democrats are viewed as doing this for partisan gamesmanship they will face a backlash. If the process effectively shuts the government down they will similarly face potential voter discontent.\n\nSo the Speaker is sad, eh? This is outside of politics? Pardon me if I scoff at your statements.\n\nThe Washington Post noted in January of 2017 that the first calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment came during his swearing-in ceremony. Of course, that was a group of Clinton supporters who were protesting. Fast forward to May of that year when Trump had been in office for less than five months. Texas Democratic Congressman Al Green made it official and called for impeachment from the floor of the House\n\nBy the time the Trump presidency had hit the six-month mark, CNN was already tracking the number of Democrats who had publicly discussed impeachment. They were up to 26 at that point and if you scroll down their list you\u2019ll see several of the same prominent Democratic names that are currently licking their chops at the prospect of finally getting their wish.\n\nSo do us all a favor and spare us your hand wringing and claims that there\u2019s \u201cno joy in this.\u201d This is indeed a \u201csad\u201d time for America, but not for Congressional Democrats. Granted, most of your caucus has managed to keep the champagne pouring away from the sight of cameras thus far, but it\u2019s party time at the DNC.\n\nI\u2019ll just close with a subtle reminder for the Speaker and her colleagues. You don\u2019t need a majority in the Senate to convict the President. You need two thirds. That will require more than a dozen Republicans. Be sure to let us know how that works out for you.", "description": "If you say so", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PelosiShrug.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
