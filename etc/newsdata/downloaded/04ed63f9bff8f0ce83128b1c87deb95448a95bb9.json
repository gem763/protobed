Out now.\u2019\n\nHazza, who exactly gave you permission?!\n\nUnderstandably, fans couldn\u2019t handle the news.\n\nWe weren\u2019t prepared (Picture: Twitter/Harry_Styles)\n\n\u2018YEEES, END US!!!\u2019 one tweeted.\n\n\u2018YOU REALLY PULLED A DRAG ME DOWN,\u2019 another pointed out.\n\nMeanwhile, one more excited fan summed up everyone\u2019s feelings by saying: \u2018IM SO PROUD OF YOU THE SINGLE IS INCREDIBLE THE MUSIC VIDEO IS INCREDIBLE IM SO INLOVE WITH EVERYTHING.\u2019\n\nNo lies detected.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been working on his new album for around a year, revealing in November last year that it was coming. The former One Direction star said: \u2018I\u2019m making my second album right now, so I\u2019m going to do that [make the right choices], read a lot and see what happens.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he\u2019s since been teasing it, with Stevie Nicks previously telling The Face magazine that the new record is \u2018not like his last album\u2019.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not like anything One Direction ever did. It\u2019s pure Harry, as Harry would say. He\u2019s made a very different record and it\u2019s spectacular,\u2019 she said.\n\nHarry\u2019s been working on his new album for about a year (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHarry added: \u2018I\u2019m not always super-outspoken. But I think it\u2019s very clear from choices that I make that I feel a certain way about lots of things.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how to describe it. I guess I\u2019m not\u2026 I want everyone to feel welcome at shows and online. They want to be loved and equal, you know?\n\n\u2018I\u2019m never unsupported, so it feels weird for me to overthink it for someone else.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, fans went into utter meltdown when the star tweeted a cryptic message after being away from social media for five months, simply telling us all \u2018Do.\u2019\n\nCome again?\n\nSafe to say, the world was more than ready for some more Styles.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
