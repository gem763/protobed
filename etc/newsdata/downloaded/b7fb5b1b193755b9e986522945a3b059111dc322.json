At the same time, we are urging U.S. politicians to end the stupid game of sanctions that brings zero results and come back to common sense.\"\n\nPrigozhin, who was already on the sanctions list for his alleged involvement in influencing the 2016 U.S. elections, uses a series of front companies to manage the yacht and planes that he and his family use to vacation around the world, Treasury said.\n\nThe U.S. accuses him of attempting to \"subvert American democratic processes,\" though there is no evidence that the efforts of the Internet Research Agency or other foreign actors managed to prevent anyone from voting, changed votes or disrupted the counting, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\n\nThe U.S. is also taking measures to protect the 2020 elections against adversaries that may be seeking to influence that vote as well, Treasury said, singling out Russia, Iran and China.\n\nIn the run-up to the November 2018 elections, the Internet Research Agency, based in St. Petersburg, Russia, used fake social media accounts to flood America with disinformation aimed to discredit candidates it deemed hostile to Russia. In 2016, the same organization sought to help Donald Trump by disparaging Hillary Clinton, according to the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the campaign.\n\nTreasury identified the six employees of the IRA facing sanctions as Dzheykhun Nasimi Ogly Aslanov; Mikhail Leonidovich Burchik; Vadim Vladimirovich Podkopaev; Vladimir Dmitriyevich Venkov; Igor Vladimirovich Nesterov; and Denis Igorevich Kuzmin.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
