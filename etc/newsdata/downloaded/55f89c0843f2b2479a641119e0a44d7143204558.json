The case achieved extraordinary dual outcomes: A white officer was convicted of killing an unarmed black man, but the process and its aftermath have further undermined faith in law enforcement for some.\n\n\u201cThe trust in the police department is not there at all,\u201d said Dominique Alexander, founder of the Next Generation Action Network, a local activist group. Like many black residents, he wants to see a federal investigation into Brown\u2019s death, unconvinced that the Dallas Police Department has fully examined what was behind the 28-year-old\u2019s killing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOf course, people are going to ask if Amber Guyger\u2019s people did this to him. Or if a police supporter did this,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, as a community leader, I can\u2019t say if they\u2019re right or wrong.\u201d\n\nThe department has insisted that Brown\u2019s death has nothing to do with his testimony against Guyger.\n\n\u201cI assure you that is simply not true,\u201d said Dallas Assistant Chief of Police Avery Moore during a news briefing Tuesday, criticizing officials and activists who have called for an independent investigation. \u201cAnd I encourage those leaders to be mindful of their actions moving forward, because their words have jeopardized the integrity of the city of Dallas as well as the Dallas Police Department.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the department\u2019s integrity has long been in question for Dallas\u2019s black residents, local leaders say, because of the history of police impunity.\n\nAD\n\nFor decades, Dallas\u2019s police department was considered among the most brutal in the country, particularly in the black and Hispanic neighborhoods of South Dallas. A local news outlet reported in the 1980s that the department was involved in more fatal shootings per capita than many other major departments.\n\nThose deaths included some particularly inflammatory cases: In 1973, an officer shot and killed a handcuffed 12-year-old Hispanic boy, Santos Rodriguez, who had been accused of stealing $8 from a vending machine; in 1986, an officer shot and killed Etta Collins, a black Sunday school teacher standing on her porch, who had called the police because she thought she heard a burglar.\n\nAD\n\nIn Rodriguez\u2019s case, the officer served just 2\u00bd years in prison. The officer who killed Collins was not indicted, according to the Associated Press.\n\nGuyger\u2019s \u201cwas the first trial since 1973 of a Dallas police officer in a fatal shooting,\u201d said John Fullinwider, a longtime community activist in Dallas. \u201cIt\u2019s been a period of almost complete unaccountability.\u201d\n\nThe department has also endured painful loss . Amid nationwide uprisings over police excessive force, a peaceful protest in Dallas turned tragic in 2016 when a gunman killed five officers.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the incident, the Dallas Police Department tweeted a photo of a black man openly carrying a rifle amid the protesters. \u201cThis is one of our suspects. Please help us find him!\u201d the department tweeted.\n\nAD\n\nThe man, Mark Hughes, turned himself in, saying he was innocent and a supporter of Second Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the system is trying to get me,\u201d Hughes said in an interview with CBS 11. The lone attacker had been killed at the scene after a standoff with police.\n\nThe department has been praised in recent years for taking some aggressive reform measures, but the checkered history has fueled questions about the fairness of Guyger\u2019s trial and the handling of Brown\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have a lack of trust, people would never assume the department would be involved,\u201d said Diane Ragsdale, a former Dallas council member who helped establish the local police review board. \u201cThere are consequences when you have a lack of trust. One of those consequences is: \u2018I don\u2019t believe what you say.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrom the beginning, Guyger\u2019s was an extraordinary case. The officer had been with the Dallas police for nearly five years, finished a shift and was still wearing her uniform when she opened the door to Jean\u2019s apartment, believing it was her own, on Sept. 6, 2018. Guyger said she mistook Jean, 26, for an intruder and shot him.\n\nGuyger\u2019s trial was punctuated with dramatic, emotional moments, including Brown\u2019s tearful testimony. Brown, who lived across the hall from Jean, said he heard Jean \u201csinging every morning,\u201d belting gospel music and Drake songs.\n\nThen, as he sat in the witness stand, Brown paused, hunched over and wiped at his eyes with his pale green T-shirt. He testified that when he got home that night, he heard people meeting with what sounded like some surprise. Then two gunshots.\n\nAD\n\nBrown said he saw Guyger come out and talk on the phone.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe was crying,\u201d he said. \u201cExplaining what happened. What she thought happened. Saying she came into the wrong apartment.\u201d\n\nThe testimony was key for the prosecution, said attorney Lee Merritt, who is representing Jean\u2019s and Brown\u2019s families.\n\n\u201cBy testifying that he could hear Botham singing in his apartment he undermines a key element of the defense,\u201d Merritt said in a Facebook post. \u201cAmber claimed she shouted commands to Botham before shooting him. . . . No one heard that. No neighbors. No passerby\u2019s. Not Joshua as he walked down the corridor. No one.\u201d\n\nGuyger was convicted and sentenced a week after Brown testified. Just days after that, Brown was fatally shot.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Guyger\u2019s trial was a welcome moment of accountability, Fullinwider said, it also exposed issues within the police department. Guyger\u2019s partner admitted under oath to deleting text messages that she had sent to him, Fullinwider said, and details disclosed during the trial showed how closely the local police union had advised Guyger, even as the scene of the shooting remained active.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the trial, an officer testified that he had tampered with police-car video after the shooting. There were questions about whether officers rendered adequate aid to Jean as he died.\n\n\u201cThe trial provides these two windows into the department: misconduct and corruption,\u201d Fullinwider said.\n\nDallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall called some of the revelations during the trial \u201cdisheartening\u201d but \u201cnot reflective of the men and women of the Dallas Police Department.\u201d During a news conference after the trial, Hall said the internal affairs division would investigate and pledged to make necessary changes.\n\nA police spokesman said Thursday that Hall was unavailable for an interview.\n\nSome residents say the skepticism about police involvement in Brown\u2019s death is overblown. As he stood outside of the Southside Flats where Jean was killed, resident Tristan Smith on Wednesday morning said that he understands how Guyger ended up in the wrong apartment.\n\nAD\n\nSmith lives down the hall from Jean\u2019s apartment, on the fourth floor of a dimly lit building full of mazelike hallways. Smith said he has almost walked into the wrong apartment before, and two weeks after the shooting, a white man accidentally wandered into Smith\u2019s apartment while he and some friends played dominoes, he said.\n\nWhile Smith didn\u2019t know Jean, he was an acquaintance of Brown, the murdered witness.\n\n\u201cHis death didn\u2019t have nothing to do with the case. People crying, \u2018Oh, the police,\u2019 that\u2019s the dumbest thing,\u201d said Smith, 30. \u201cIt\u2019s no conspiracy, man. That dude was doing his thing and got caught up.\u201d\n\nThe bizarre confluence of events involved in Guyger\u2019s case makes it difficult to draw broader conclusions about the state of police accountability from the trial\u2019s outcome, experts say.\n\nWhile the number of officers charged with fatally killing people while on duty has ticked up in recent years, the increases are statistically insignificant, said Philip Stinson, a Bowling Green State University professor. Since 2005, when Stinson began tracking, 106 officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter for an on-duty shooting. Of that number, 36 have been convicted of crimes so far, often for lesser charges, such as misconduct.\n\nPunishments for fatal shootings have ranged from no time in prison to four decades behind bars, according to Stinson.\n\nGuyger\u2019s shooting is not included in Stinson\u2019s figures because she was off-duty at the time.\n\nBut critics assailed her 10-year sentence as insufficient, comparing it with lengthier punishments handed out to people for lesser crimes than murder.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question in my view that that is an unfair sentence when you compare it to sentences meted out to people of color every day in this country,\u201d said Christy Lopez, who ran the Justice Department group investigating police departments under the Obama administration. Harsh sentences should be addressed across the justice system, she added. \u201cThere\u2019s a real need to recalibrate our sense of what a quote-unquote \u2018right sentence\u2019 is.\u201d\n\nRobert Rogers, an attorney for Guyger, said it\u2019s a mistake to lump the case in with other officer-involved shootings.\n\n\u201cThis was a 30-year-old woman who . . . shot what she thought was an intruder,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cShe actually shot a truly innocent man who was absolutely doing nothing. And it was a storm of circumstances that you\u2019ll never see again.\u201d", "description": "Days after Guyger\u2019s trial concluded, key witness Joshua Brown was killed in what police attribute to a drug deal gone bad.", "authors": ["Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter", "Mark Berman", "National Reporter Covering Law Enforcement", "Criminal Justice", "Wesley Lowery", "National Correspondent Covering Law Enforcement", "Justice", "Their Intersection With Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_DKQ2bJO0fg_lzutWkUGaGea4ZY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NH5OQEHLTEI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
