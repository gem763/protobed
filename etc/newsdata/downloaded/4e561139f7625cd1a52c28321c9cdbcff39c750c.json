Agents of the Saudi government killed Khashoggi inside the consulate and apparently dismembered his body, which has never been found. Saudi Arabia has charged 11 people in the slaying and put them on trial, which has been held in secret. As of yet, no one has been convicted.\n\nA U.N. report asserted that Saudi Arabia bore responsibility for the killing and said the crown prince\u2019s possible role in it should be investigated. In Washington, Congress has said it believes the crown prince is \u201cresponsible for the murder.\u201d Saudi Arabia has long insisted the crown prince had no involvement in an operation that included agents who reported directly to him.\n\n\u201cSome think that I should know what 3 million people working for the Saudi government do daily,\u201d the powerful heir told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019s impossible that the 3 million would send their daily reports to the leader or the second-highest person in the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nIn an interview Thursday in New York, Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, told The Associated Press that responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s slaying \u201cwas not limited to the perpetrators\u201d and said she wanted the crown prince to tell her: \u201cWhy was Jamal killed? Where is his body? What was the motive for this murder?\u201d\n\nThe crown prince also addressed the Sept. 14 missile and drone attack on Saudi oil facilities. While Yemen\u2019s Iranian-allied Houthi rebels claimed the assault, Saudi Arabia has said it was \u201cunquestionably sponsored by Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no strategic goal,\u201d the crown prince said of the attack. \u201cOnly a fool would attack 5% of global supplies. The only strategic goal is to prove that they are stupid and that is what they did.\u201d\n\nHe urged \u201cstrong and firm action to deter Iran.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in a television interview that he takes \"full responsibility\" for the grisly murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but denied allegations that he ordered it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/saudi_writer_killed_57725_c0-199-4762-2975_s1770x1032.jpg?207c7dde844e8427dfffc8387003ce2049401f6d", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
