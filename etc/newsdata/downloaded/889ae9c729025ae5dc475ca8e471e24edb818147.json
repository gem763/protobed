If you have both at the same time, there will be tension. Here\u2019s the situation in Denmark vis a vis immigration, according to Wikipedia, under the leadership of its new left-of-center prime minister Mette Frederiksen:\n\nUnder Frederiksen, the Social Democrats voted in favor of a law allowing Danish authorities to confiscate money, jewellery and other valuable items from refugees crossing the border, despite harsh condemnation from the United Nations Human Right Council and widespread comparisons between the plan and the treatment of Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. Similarly, [Frederiksen\u2019s] Social Democrats voted for a law banning wearing of burqas and niqabs while abstaining during a vote on a law on mandatory handshakes irrespective of religious sentiment at citizenship ceremonies and on a plan to house criminal asylum seekers on an island used for researching contagious animal diseases. Frederiksen also backed the right-wing populist Danish People\u2019s Party in their paradigm shift push to make repatriation rather than integration the goal of asylum policy. She has called for a cap on non-Western immigrants, expulsion of asylum seekers to a reception centre in North Africa and forced labour for immigrants in exchange for benefits . . . . Frederiksen has referred to Islam as a barrier to integration, arguing that some Muslims \u201cdo not respect the Danish judicial system\u201d, that some Muslim women refuse to work for religious reasons and that Muslim girls are subject to \u201cmassive social control\u201d. In an interview with Kristeligt Dagblad, Frederiksen called for the \u201cclosure of all immigrant centres\u201d and for the \u201cresettlement of immigrants in North Africa\u201d.\n\nPutting asylum seekers on \u201can island used for researching contagious animal diseases\u201d is, I\u2019m guessing, a policy that AOC would call the most savage and heartless idea she\u2019d ever heard if Donald Trump had proposed it.", "description": "Does AOC know what her favorite country thinks about immigration?", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Katherine Timpf", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
