Three thousand miles off the Eastern coast of New Zealand and more than 2 miles deep, it's the one place farthest from any land mass on Earth.\n\nThe perfect spot to land giant chunks of spacecraft that are traveling more than 180 mph upon impact. NASA predicts the chance of a spacecraft hitting someone out here to be around 1 in 10,000.\n\nSince 1971, over 263 spacecraft from four nations have crashed here. Only the largest spacecraft ever make it here. Smaller satellites burn up completely before reaching the surface.\n\nNext on NASA's list is the International Space Station. It's scheduled for decommission in 12 years to finally take its place among sunken space history.", "description": "Dead spacecraft tell many tales.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Lee", "Dave Mosher"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59f09ea88280a62c008b4b62-750-375.png"}
