I\u2019m practising and I\u2019ve got wires all around the table. There\u2019s no security, you\u2019ve got people running at you left, right and centre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not the fans\u2019 fault. They [World Snooker] obviously haven\u2019t got the budget to run it properly. I don\u2019t know where their budget is but they\u2019re cutting corners. I think they should invest in good venues. Players deserve better.\u2019\n\nIt was a harsh assessment of what, on assessment, is a perfectly nice leisure centre with no discernible smell of urine at all \u2013 a thorough walk around the building and not a single whiff of wee was detected.\n\nThe K2 Leisure Centre on the opening day of the English Open 2019 (Picture: Phil Haigh)\n\nThe busy nature of the place is a more understandable gripe from the five-time world champion as the K2 is very much open for business for its other clients while the snooker is going on.\n\nAs you enter the playing area you walk past a class of, mainly, middle-aged women doing yoga. By the practice room is a room for gymnastics that was also being used for some kind of parent-and-baby class. There are squash courts, martial arts classes and people milling about in the cafe. A dedicated cathedral of snooker like the Crucible, it is not.\n\nHowever, for a Monday morning in Crawley, the K2 was doing a roaring trade.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan said of the situation last year: \u2018As a player you don\u2019t want to be traipsing through families and kids, who are going swimming, got their flip-flops and snorkels, and you are about to play a match. You want to be in your bubble sometimes.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has a point, but options are limited for World Snooker when it comes to events such as the English Open, which sees 128 players competing in the first round across seven tables.\n\nThe main table on the opening morning of the English Open (Picture: Phil Haigh)\n\nThe number of venues willing and able to host such an event are not plentiful, especially when crowds will not exactly be stellar for all the sessions, some of which start at 10am on weekdays.\n\nThe outer tables do not get many eyes on them on a Monday morning (Picture: Phil Haigh)\n\nWorld Snooker chairman Barry Hearn explained the situation last year: \u2018The English Open is a great event but it\u2019s not the biggest on the calendar.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an event that serves 128 players and part of the home nations. We run a business. We don\u2019t go out to save money, but don\u2019t have unlimited budgets. We don\u2019t live on fantasy island, we live in the real world.\n\n\u2018Trust me, we would be in Wembley Arena every week if we could. But there\u2019s no point hiring Wembley and having 400 people.\u2019\n\nLike many of the sport\u2019s tournament venues, the K2 was only hired on a one-year deal in 2018, which has been renewed this year, so there were certainly no worries from the governing body\u2019s point of view. The tournament prize fund has also been upped to \u00a3405,000 from \u00a3366,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorld Snooker were dismissive of the criticism from the Rocket, releasing a statement which read: \u2018We are surprised to hear these comments from Ronnie given that he has made no formal complaint and the feedback from the other players has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\n\u2018And the partners we are working with on the event agree with our view that K2 Crawley is an excellent venue with very good facilities.\u2019\n\nO\u2019Sullivan received no punishment for slamming the K2 last year and he is back in Crawley and in first round action on Monday night when he takes on Jamie O\u2019Neill.\n\nWorld champion Judd Trump is also back in action at the event on the opening day, playing former world champ Peter Ebdon in the afternoon session.\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s English Open opponent Jamie O\u2019Neill is back on tour after a \u2018four or five year party\u2019\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan and Judd Trump complete cracking English Open line-up", "description": "Crawley plays host to snooker's English Open once again this week at the same venue described by Ronnie O'Sullivan as a 'hellhole' that 'smelled of urine'.
