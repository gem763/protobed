It is a dream as a referee,\" said Garces, who also took charge of the blockbuster South Africa v New Zealand pool match on the opening weekend.\n\nAt Japan 2019, he has also refereed Ireland v Russia and Wales v Fiji at the pool stage, as well as the quarter-final between England and Australia and the semi-final where South Africa narrowly beat Wales.\n\nGarces has enjoyed a glittering final year of his career after he refereed the European Champions Cup final between Leinster and Saracens in May, as well as the French Top 14 final between Toulouse and Clermont in June.\n\nDuring the World Cup, he has brandished a total of six yellow cards - two against Russia when they were playing Ireland, and two to each team in the physical Wales v Fiji pool match.\n\nDespite a number of red cards at this World Cup, mostly for high tackles, he has not sent anyone off.\n\nIn both of the Springbok games he has refereed, he has penalised the South Africans nine times. He blew up against England eight times in their match against Australia.\n\nSome Springbok fans will not cheer his appointment. A group of South Africa supporters set up an online petition to stop Garces officiating their semi-final, attracting more than 13 000 signatures.\n\nEnglishman Wayne Barnes, ineligible for the final after England qualified, will take charge of the third-place playoff in Tokyo on Friday between Wales and New Zealand - as he did in 2011.\n\nPeyper wasn't selected for the semis after a viral photo showed him posing with Wales fans holding out his right elbow - after sending off France's Sebastien Vahaamahina for elbowing Welsh flank Aaron Wainwright in the quarter-finals.\n\nPeyper released an apologetic statement in which he admitted the picture was \"inappropriate\". But he appears to have earned a reprieve after his selection as a touch judge for Friday's playoff.", "description": "French referee Jerome Garces will take charge of Saturday's Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa, his final match as a referee.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7844/4732f206c3de4f2eba1f2cf50f476be7.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
