The genocide measure officially recognizes the systematic killing of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923.\n\nFor years, Turkey\u2019s government had successfully lobbied to kill such congressional resolutions, pressuring presidents and lawmakers alike. The Turks have arguing the Armenians who died during that era were victims of civil war and unrest, not genocide. On Tuesday, it passed by an overwhelming vote of 405-to-11, with three lawmakers voting \"present.\"\n\nThe genocide and sanctions measures represent \u201ca double whammy\u201d for Turkey, said Bulent Aliriza, director of the Turkey Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington foreign policy institute.\n\nTurkey condemned the House vote, saying the sanctions bill is \"incompatible with the spirit of our allied relations under NATO.\"\n\n\" ... US officials, who have ignored the discourse and actions that ignore the difference between an Allied country and a terrorist organization in the last days, should see that they cannot reach a place with unilateral sanction threats,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nLawmakers in both parties barreled ahead with the two measures to make Erdogan pay for Turkey's assault on U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in Syria even though the fighting has now mostly stopped. Members of Congress say Erdogan's attack unleashed violence and chaos that continues to reverberate across the region.\n\n\"America is holding accountable top Turkish officials responsible for human rights abuses, including attacking our Kurdish partners,\" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"We're penalizing Turkish financial institutions who perpetuate President Erdogan's corruption and abuses.\"\n\nPelosi, D-Calif., fast-tracked the sanctions legislation, which goes well beyond President Donald Trump's temporary sanctions on Turkey. Although it passed the House by a vote of 403-to-16, its fate in the Senate is unclear.\n\nAmong other things, the legislation would:\n\n\u2022 Ban most U.S. arms sales to Turkey and sanction other countries' military transactions.\n\n\u2022 Sanctions senior Turkish officials involved in the Syria attack\n\n\u2022 Blacklist a state-owned bank that is central to Turkey's economy.\n\n\u2022 Require the State Department to provide a detailed account of Erdogan's net worth and income \u2013 along with that of his family members.\n\n\"The carnage that we have seen over the past week against our Kurdish partners and innocent civilians has been unbearable. There must be consequences,\" Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in unveiling the sanctions bill. He and the committee's chairman, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., are the chief sponsors.\n\nErdogan's press office in Ankara did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump imposed limited sanctions on Turkey on Oct. 14, about five days after Erdogan ordered the military assault on Syrian Kurdish forces, known as the SDF. The president lifted those sanctions nine days later after Turkey agreed to a cease-fire.\n\n\"The president\u2019s sanctions were little pinpricks,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who has sponsored a similar Turkey sanctions bill in the Senate, along with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nWhen he lifted the sanctions on Oct. 23, Trump said his policy had been a big success.\n\n\"By getting that cease-fire to stick, we\u2019ve done something that\u2019s very, very special,\" he said. \"We have avoided another costly military intervention that could\u2019ve led to disastrous, far-reaching consequences.\"\n\nBut Van Hollen and others said it's not clear what influence, if any, Trump's sanctions had on Turkey.\n\nThe House and Senate bills, by contrast, would almost certainly rock Turkey's already fragile economy. And the provisions targeting Erdogan's wealth are particularly provocative, experts say.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has fast-tracked a sanctions bill for Turkey that would require a detailed accounting of President Erdogan's net worth.", "authors": ["Deirdre Shesgreen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X9xLFvC79wSyRR5dZZ.4Zw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/1726d8fd-991e-4631-9a40-cf12eead1910/588312ff-2094-5fbe-8333-98e70f89b8d0/data_3_0.jpg?s=1e39f8ae86655c6e1f2c5648fe56b513&c=b04bd5e40c3925f28636f3c3bce92eb8&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
