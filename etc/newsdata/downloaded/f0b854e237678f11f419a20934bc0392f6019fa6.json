His prepared statement, first reported by the New York Times, bolsters previous testimony by Fiona Hill, his former boss at the National Security Council, and William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony follows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-Calif.) call for a vote later this week authorizing the impeachment inquiry. Pelosi\u2019s move came in response to Republican criticism that the Democrats\u2019 activities to date amount to a partisan hit job and have denied the president due process.\n\nIn his statement Vindman repeatedly insists he has no partisan bias and asserts that he is motivated by loyalty to the Constitution and the country. Vindman and his family fled the Soviet Union when he was 3, and he describes himself as both an immigrant and a patriot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d his prepared statement reads.\n\nVindman was assigned to the White House in July 2018 after a tour in the Pentagon, where he writes that he authored the U.S. military\u2019s principal strategy for managing competition with Russia.\n\nIn his statement Vindman states that he has never had direct contact or communication with the president. He also notes that he is not the whistleblower whose complaint helped spark the impeachment inquiry .\n\n\u201cI do not know who the whistleblower is and I would not feel comfortable to speculate,\u201d his statement reads.\n\nDespite his remove from the White House, Vindman became deeply concerned about the way the president and some of his top advisers were manipulating Ukraine policy to discredit Biden, a possible challenger in the 2020 election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVindman states that Trump\u2019s initial call with the new Ukrainian president, made after Zelensky\u2019s April election, was positive.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump expressed his desire to work with President Zelensky and extended an invitation to the White House,\u201d the statement reads. Vindman notes that the Ukrainians saw the meeting with Trump as \u201ccritical\u201d to solidifying American support in the face of Russian aggression.\n\nBut within weeks of that initial promise, he grew worried that the policy was being hijacked by partisan politics.\n\n\u201cIn the Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine,\u201d his statement reads. \u201cThis alternative narrative undermined U.S. efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVindman cites a July 10 meeting in which Gordon Sondland, a major Trump donor and ambassador to the European Union, emphasized that to secure a meeting with Trump, the Ukrainians would have to \u201cdeliver investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,\u201d a Ukrainian natural gas company that had controversially tapped Biden\u2019s son to serve on its board.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the National Security Council was going to get involved with or push,\u201d his statements reads.\n\nFollowing the briefing, Vindman reported his concerns to the National Security Council\u2019s top lawyer. Vindman\u2019s statement notes that an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma would likely inject Ukraine\u2019s new president into U.S. politics and cause the struggling democracy to lose bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis would undermine U.S. national security,\u201d Vindman writes.\n\nVindman\u2019s most direct contact with Trump came in the form of preparing documents for the president to sign regarding Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nAt the direction of his superiors at the NSC, including John Bolton, then the national security adviser, Vindman drafted a memorandum in mid-August that sought to restart $391 million in security aid that was being withheld from Ukraine, according to the Times report. But Trump refused to sign it. He also drafted a letter in May congratulating Zelensky on his inauguration that Trump declined to sign, according to the Times.\n\nIn his testimony Vindman, like others who have preceded him in the impeachment hearings, emphasizes the importance of Ukraine to the security of the United States. \u201cA strong and independent Ukraine is critical to U.S. national security interests because Ukraine is a front-line state and bulwark against Russian aggression,\u201d he writes.\n\nAD", "description": "Lt.
