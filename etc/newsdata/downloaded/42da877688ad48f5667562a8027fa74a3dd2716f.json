In the SEAL Teams, we use a gunfighting tactic called \u201cCover and Move.\u201d One shooter covers for another by laying down suppressive fire so the other shooter can move. Then, they swap roles and leapfrog to the objective.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nSometimes one covers, sometimes one moves. Both are crucial to mission success. The concept works for a single shooter pair of two SEALs or for large teams supporting other large teams.\n\nCover and Move is teamwork. A team working together, mutually supporting one another to accomplish the mission is far more powerful and far more likely to be successful.\n\nWhen Jocko Willink retired from the U.S. Navy and I left active duty, we launched a leadership consulting firm called Echelon Front to pass on the leadership lessons we learned in combat to leaders in business. Before we began working with companies, however, we wondered how this gunfighting tactic of Cover and Move would apply in the civilian sector.\n\nThere were silos in their organization, and some individuals were focused only on their specific department goals and not on the greater mission of the company. They needed Cover and Move.\n\nAs we sat down with business leaders, it became clear: departments weren\u2019t working together. There were silos in their organization, and some individuals were focused only on their specific department goals and not on the greater mission of the company. They needed Cover and Move.\n\nIn the seven years since we founded Echelon Front we\u2019ve worked with hundreds of companies across a broad array of industries and nearly everyone has this challenge. Frictions between different departments with different goals are problematic. They can even turn hostile.\n\nWhen this happens, it\u2019s destructive to the team and catastrophic to the mission. When the company fails, everybody fails \u2014 even if a few individuals or a single department or group within the team accomplished their specific tasks. If the overall team fails, none of it matters.\n\nThe key to teamwork: Relationships\n\nThese problems aren\u2019t hard to solve. The key to Cover and Move is simple: build relationships. That requires humility and ownership. Someone in one of the departments or teams in conflict must reach out to their counterpart in the other department or team and take ownership.\n\nThe most effective conversation sounds like this: \u201cWe haven\u2019t supported you the way we should have and that\u2019s my fault. I\u2019ve been so focused on my team\u2019s own goals that I haven\u2019t reached out to make sure you\u2019re getting what you need from us. Going forward, I\u2019m going to regularly check in with you and your team to understand what you need and when so that we can better support you.\u201d\n\nThe conversation is simple, not easy. It\u2019s hard to put your ego in check. But when you do so, it deescalates the situation and strengthens relationships.\n\nThe stronger the relationship between different individuals, departments or teams within the company, the better they can Cover and Move for each other. Through relationships, silos break down; teams mutually support one another and the probability of success increases radically.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nIt\u2019s human nature to focus on one\u2019s own immediate tasks, challenges and frustrations and sometimes lose sight of the greater strategic mission.\n\nBut to understand Cover and Move is to recognize that it\u2019s not about you, but about the mission. Every member of the team must work together, mutually supporting one another, in order to win.\n\nWhen the team wins, everybody wins. That\u2019s Cover and Move.\n\nLeif Babin is a former Navy SEAL Officer, co-author of the New York Times Best Sellers, Extreme Ownership and The Dichotomy of Leadership.
