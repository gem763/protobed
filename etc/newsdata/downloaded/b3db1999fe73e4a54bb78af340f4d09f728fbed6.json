Order!\u201d have made him one of British politics\u2019 most recognisable figures - inspiring viral video clips replayed on news bulletins around the world.\n\nThe three years since Britain voted to leave the European Union have tested the limits of the country\u2019s unwritten constitution as successive governments repeatedly clashed with rival lawmakers over the right way to leave the bloc.\n\nBercow, 56, has found himself, and sometimes put himself, at the centre of big moments in the Brexit tug-of-war between the legislature and the executive, habitually favouring scrutiny and debate over allowing the government control of the exit process.\n\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid tennis-lover Bercow a backhanded compliment, describing him not just as a \u201cruthless\u201d umpire of parliamentary procedure, but a sometimes cruel commentator and a partisan player in his own right:\n\n\u201cPeppering every part of the chamber with your own thoughts and opinions like some uncontrollable tennis-ball machine.\u201d\n\nSpeaker John Bercow is seen at the House of Commons in London, Britain, October 30, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video. Parliament TV via REUTERS\n\nBercow was elected as a member of the ruling Conservative Party in 1997, but gave up that affiliation when he was chosen to be Speaker by fellow lawmakers in 2009.\n\nCHECKS AND BALANCES\n\nFond of long, wordy statements - often incorporating obscure historical facts - he has been accused of overstepping the mark and abandoning the political neutrality of his office.\n\nNot least on Brexit when his rulings on complex procedural points have allowed those opposed to the government\u2019s plans to add extra checks and balances to the Brexit process.\n\n\u201cThe dilemmas you face mean that, on occasion, you will sometimes have to please some and not others, but it is becoming remarkable how often you please one lot and not the other lot,\u201d lawmaker Bernard Jenkin, chair of the committee that scrutinises the Speaker\u2019s work, told Bercow last week in a testy exchange.\n\nUnsurprisingly, in a deeply divided parliament, Bercow\u2019s approach earned him as much praise as it did rancour.\n\n\u201cYou have stood up for parliament when it has to be stood up for, and we thank you for that,\u201d Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn said.\n\nBritain's Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow speaks at the House of Commons in London, Britain October 30, 2019. \u00a9UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERS\n\nBeyond Brexit, Bercow has led major reform of the antiquated procedures and traditions inside parliament. He turned a popular bar into a nursery for the children of staff and ditched the Speaker\u2019s traditional court dress for a business suit worn under a gown.\n\nBut he has also courted controversy, surviving an outcry over expense claims - including costly use of official cars and overseas trips - and facing allegations of bullying from former members of staff, which he has denied.\n\nHe promised his family he would not contest another election and his replacement will be elected next week, with the favourite currently deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle - a 62 year-old member of the opposition Labour Party who says the Speaker must be independent and fair, and promises to work to unite parliament.", "description": "House of Commons Speaker John Bercow will step down on Thursday, ending a 10-year term in which he has become a central player in Britain's protracted Brexit debate - feted by the \"Remain\" side but reviled by many Brexiteers.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446654681&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1HW", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
