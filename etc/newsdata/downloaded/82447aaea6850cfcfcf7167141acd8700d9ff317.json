REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\nIt said in a statement on Thursday Ferrand, who denies any wrongdoing, would use the procedure to defend himself and was confident the case would be dropped.\n\nThe move, which comes after Ferrand was questioned at length earlier on Wednesday by investigating judges, is likely to be an embarrassment for Macron and could bring renewed scrutiny to his promise to clean up French politics.\n\nUnder French law, being put under formal investigation means there is \u201cserious or consistent evidence\u201d that points to probable involvement of a suspect in a crime.\n\nIt is a step towards a trial, but many investigations have been dropped without going to court.\n\nA previous investigation by French public prosecutors into Ferrand\u2019s financial dealings was dropped in late 2017. Ferrand resigned as a minister during that probe.\n\nAs a lawmaker, he now heads Macron\u2019s party in the lower house of parliament. The latest probe relates, like the previous one, to Ferrand\u2019s management of a health insurance company in Brittany.\n\nThe new investigation was launched after the anti-corruption group Anticor refiled its original complaint in a different jurisdiction, an aide to Ferrand said.\n\nHis office said Ferrand was confident the case would be closed because no new evidence had been put forward since it was dropped the first time.\n\nMacron\u2019s right-hand man during the 2017 presidential campaign, Ferrand became embroiled in allegations of financial impropriety within days of Macron\u2019s victory in May.\n\nThe allegations that Ferrand allegedly benefited improperly from property deals done eight years ago by a health insurance fund he managed tainted the early weeks of the Macron presidency.", "description": "French National Assembly President Richard Ferrand, a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, was put under formal investigation on Wednesday in a financial impropriety case, his office said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428869977&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B005", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
