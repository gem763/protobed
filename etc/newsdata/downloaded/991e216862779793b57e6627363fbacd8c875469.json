Nearly the whole state, which has an area more than three times the size of the United Kingdom, remains in some drought category.\n\nThe state also has been hit by spring fires, further straining the communities in the region. Two people were killed and more than 50 homes were destroyed in the latest bushfires, which are yet to be contained.\n\nAustralia's conservative government has been slow in addressing the country's increasing climate challenges, arguing often that stronger environmental action would cripple the economy.\n\nThe Nature Conservation Council, an environmental advocacy group in New South Wales, criticized the government's slow actions and the dam plans, saying they don't provide water security as they deprive people downstream of water.\n\n\"Building new dams is like paying off your house loan with a credit card, we're just getting deeper and deeper into water debt,\" Nature Conservation Council spokesman James Tremain told Reuters.\n\n\"It's not addressing the fundamental issue and that is that we extract too much water from our rivers and we have done nothing to acknowledge or address climate change, which is exacerbating the problem.\" ($1 = 1.4734 Australian dollars) (Writing by Lidia Kelly Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "description": "Australia will invest A$1 billion ($678.70 million) to revamp water infrastructure in rural and regional communities in the drought-stricken New South Wales.  \"Our response to the ongoing drought impacting rural and regional communities is comprehensive and committed,\" Prime Minister Scott", "authors": ["Lidia Kelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
