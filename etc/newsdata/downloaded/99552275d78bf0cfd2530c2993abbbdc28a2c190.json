The secret? The mysterious Top Happy Spa, nestled in a suburban strip mall, that promises rejuvenation by cloning a new, idealized version of its patrons.\n\nApprehensive in his first visit, Miles runs into the spa's No. 1 customer \u2013 the New England Patriots quarterback \u2013 who asks Miles if it's his \"first time\" there.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Miles responds. \"You?\"\n\n\"Six,\" says Brady (which just happens to be the number of his Super Bowl victories).\n\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has a pitch-perfect cameo in the first episode of Netflix's Paul Rudd comedy, \"Living With Yourself.\" (Photo: Netflix, Netflix)\n\n\"If the idea is you kind of fire on all cylinders after having this treatment done, who's the example of someone who might have done this?\" Rudd says.\n\n\"Living\" creator Tim Greenberg wrote Brady into his first script more than four years ago (when Brady had only four Super Bowl rings), and Rudd says he laughed when he first saw it. Neither thought they had a chance of snagging Brady for the brief gig, shot in a Boston-area hotel parking lot after last year's NFL season.\n\nPaul Rudd stars as Miles Elliott and his better half in Netflix comedy \"Living With Yourself.\" (Photo: Eric Liebowitz/Netflix)\n\n\"Nobody seemed to check every box like Tom Brady,\" Rudd says. \"He's kind of the epitome of excellence in just about every category.\"\n\n\"It was a bit of a dance,\" adds Greenberg. \"We had a giant list of backups, but he's just the perfect specimen. Everybody else would've been a big letdown. So the fact that we got him was great.\"\n\nPaul Rudd and Aisling Bea star in Netflix's \"Living With Yourself.\" (Photo: Chris Delmas, AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/19/paul-rudd-netflix-show-enlists-tom-brady-cameo/4003359002/", "description": "New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has a brief but memorable appearance in Paul Rudd's new Netflix comedy, 'Living With Yourself.'", "authors": ["Gary Levin", "Published A.M.
