It\u2019s time to tighten the purse strings.\n\nIn other words, rate cuts are having a perverse expectations effect on the economy.\n\nOf course, one area where lower rates have helped is in reigniting the Sydney and Melbourne property markets. This could ultimately contribute to higher consumer spending through the so-called \u201cwealth effect\u201d, but at the cost of keeping house prices reliant on super low interest rates and consumer spending reliant on super high debt levels.\n\nLower interest rates have also arguably helped keep the Australian dollar low, especially given the recent strength in iron ore export prices. But if this is what the RBA is aiming for, it\u2019s as guilty as other central banks in engaging in the zero-sum global currency war. In fact, given the current level of the terms of trade, the $A appears undervalued and we\u2019d better hope US President Trump does not notice.\n\nSo what to do? Every pet shop galah is now talking about infrastructure spending. More would be certainly handy, but such spending is already at a high level and it takes time for good projects to be developed and become \u201cshovel ready\u201d.\n\nA far more direct means would be for the government to directly boost household income by bringing forward personal income tax cuts. Indeed, it\u2019s especially galling \u2013 as pointed out by the RBA itself - that one of the major drags on household income growth in recent years has been a higher tax grab. Even more galling is that fact that the much heralded income tax cuts over the next few years will only partly hand back higher taxes collected through bracket creep.\n\nAnd if low wages are the main economic problem, why not review wages policy more directly? Are worker bargaining provisions strong enough given high immigration, new technologies and globalisation? Are too many workers, such as students and foreign workers, being unduly exploited? What can be done to ensure more casual part-time workers get the full-time positions they desire?\n\nSo far at least, RBA rate cuts don\u2019t appear to be working. The current strategy of pushing rates even lower \u2013 and hopefully household debt even higher \u2013 may indirectly boost wage growth some day, but it\u2019s a long and dangerous path for the economy.\n\nDavid Bassanese is the chief economist for BetaShares Capital.", "description": "The cash rate has already been cut too far, and even lower rates will likely hurt more than help meet our longer-term economic challenges.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4c622de1c8fa89f7ae03e3e74f43ccb1a6bf74a9", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
