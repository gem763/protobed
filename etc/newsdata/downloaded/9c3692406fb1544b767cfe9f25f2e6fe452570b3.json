While those islands lie in Karen's projected path for landfall on Tuesday, little change in the storm's strength was forecast for the next 48 hours, the NHC said.\n\nPuerto Rico, buffeted by political turmoil and bankruptcy, was spared a potential new disaster last month when Hurricane Dorian skirted past the U.S. island territory, only to subsequently lay waste to the northern Bahamas.\n\nTwo years ago, Puerto Rico was still getting back on its feet from Hurricane Irma when it took a direct hit from Hurricane Maria, which destroyed roads and bridges and left much of the island without electricity for months. Some 3,000 people perished in that storm, the deadliest in the island's history.\n\nA separate Atlantic tropical storm, Jerry, had higher sustained winds, clocked at 65 mph (100 kph), but remained farther from land on Sunday, the NHC said.\n\nForecasts called for Jerry to veer sharply to the northeast and pass Tuesday night near Bermuda, far off the South Carolina coast, although no watches or warnings were posted as yet.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "description": "Puerto Rico is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria, which killed over 3,000 people, the deadliest in the island's history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8814c02e22af1ad3592263-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
