HealthCare.gov, the website where people could sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, had been marred by major technical problems and there was concern in the White House that not enough people would be able to obtain health insurance ahead of the pending deadline.\n\nAround that time, President Obama\u2019s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett convened a meeting with entertainers to brainstorm ideas on how to get young people to buy insurance plans on the exchanges before it was too late. Among them was comedian Scott Aukerman, co-creator of Funny or Die\u2019s Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis and the writer-director of Netflix\u2019s new Between Two Ferns: The Movie.\n\n\u201cIt was a bunch of Hollywood players trying to come up with ideas for videos that would steer people to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Aukerman tells me on this week\u2019s episode of The Last Laugh podcast. \u201cAnd I think a lot of that stuff is really lame. The reason it can be really lame is everyone\u2019s so protective of what gets out there into the world. So if you see a politician on a late-night talk show, if they\u2019re reading jokes, all I can think about is the speechwriters that have gone through and red-lined jokes. They all seem so safe. They don\u2019t seem dangerous at all.\u201d\n\nWhen it was Aukerman\u2019s turn to speak, he suggested that Obama appear on Between Two Ferns, the web series in which the host Zach Galifianakis is known for insulting celebrities like Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Bieber to their faces. \u201cThat was my only idea,\u201d he admits.\n\nA few months passed and Aukerman\u2019s idea started to look like it might actually happen. \u201cWhen it finally became something that it seemed like he was going to do, you start having their people try to shape it and preemptively try to get in there and be like, \u2018Well let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going to happen,\u2019\u201d he says of the White House staff. He says they told him, \u201cObviously, you can\u2019t do it like a real Between Two Ferns.\u201d\n\nCody Keenan, who had recently taken over the job of Obama\u2019s head speechwriter from Jon Favreau, was tasked with making sure the president\u2019s message was represented in the video.\n\n\u201cThe final product had to balance a few things,\u201d Keenan tells me by email. \u201cIt had to remain true to what Between Two Ferns is, or why would Funny or Die do it? It had to plug the ACA as much as possible, or why would we do it? Simply put, it had to walk the line between remaining authentic for fans, and attractive to the people we were trying to reach. But it also had to protect the dignity of the office of the president of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t worried about President Obama\u2019s comic chops,\u201d Keenan adds, \u201cor the critics who\u2019d clutch their pearls no matter what\u2014but we wouldn\u2019t put him in a situation that was embarrassing or too off-color.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Aukerman says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s happened a few times in my life where the opportunity is great, but it\u2019s not worth it if they\u2019re going to make you compromise to that extent. So I just kind of had to lay down the law. This is the way we do it. We have to have final cut over it. Yes, we can talk about jokes that you don\u2019t want in there, but we have to be able to make hard jokes, otherwise this is pointless.\u201d\n\nInitially, Aukerman says Obama\u2019s communications staff \u201creally got behind that.\u201d He and Galifianakis put a loose script together for their approval. \u201cThere was one joke where Zach says, \u2018How does it feel to be the last black president?\u2019 which kind of seems prescient at this point,\u201d Aukerman says. \u201cObama\u2019s people were like, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s just not going to fly.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh man, that\u2019s the funniest joke.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter some back and forth, Obama\u2019s staff relented. According to Aukerman, Keenan said, \u201cYou know what? I spend all day cutting stuff out because of how people are going to react to it. I don\u2019t want you guys to go through that. Go ahead, do the joke.\u201d\n\nBut then, right before they were about to shoot the video in the White House, Galifianakis came up to Aukerman and said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m cutting this joke.\u201d Aukerman told him, \u201cNo, no, no, you have to do it!\u201d to which Galifanakis replied, \u201cNo, he\u2019s not going to like it if I say it.\u2019\u201d Aukerman had to convince Galifianakis that it was approved and Obama was \u201cexpecting\u201d him to ask it. \u201cIt will throw him if you don\u2019t,\u201d Aukerman told him. \u201cSo that\u2019s how we got it in.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Keenan says he doesn\u2019t remember \u201c balking\u201d at \u201cthe last black president\u201d joke, adding, \u201cI remember thinking it was funny. It\u2019s possible other people on staff had a different view.\u201d There was, however, one other joke about the president\u2019s \u201csex life\u201d that he dismissed outright. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I wouldn\u2019t budge on,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to Keenan, in between takes Galifianakis kept saying \u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys are letting us do this.\u201d\n\nWhen Galifianakis was on Conan in 2016, he revealed that he thought of another joke when he went to the White House mess hall and saw that there was a dessert called \u201cChocolate Freedom.\u201d He considered asking Obama if the dessert was named after him, but ultimately decided he couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cPresident Obama would have said yes,\u201d Keenan tells me.\n\nIn the final cut, Obama answered Galifianakis\u2019 \u201clast black president\u201d question by asking, \u201cSeriously? What\u2019s it like for this to be the last time you ever talk to a president?\u201d\n\nNeither Keenan nor Aukerman can remember if that retort was improvised or fed to the president. \u201cBut he knew what he was getting into,\u201d Keenan says, explaining that he showed Obama the Bradley Cooper and Ben Stiller episodes of Between Two Ferns right before they filmed with Galifianakis.\n\nThe president must have had the Hangover movies on his mind because he did ad lib the lines about Cooper \u201ccarrying\u201d those films and one making fun of the third sequel. \u201cIf I ran a third time, it would be sort of like doing a third Hangover movie,\u201d Obama joked. \u201cDidn\u2019t really work out very well, did it?\u201d\n\nAfter they finished shooting, a transcript circulated around the White House and Aukerman got word that people on Obama\u2019s staff thought it was really funny.\n\n\u201cBut even then, we were celebrating that night and some of Obama\u2019s people came up to me and said, \u2018So that was really funny, but obviously it can\u2019t be like that ,\u2019\u201d Aukerman recalls. \u201c\u2018Right now you have a six-minute video where you talk about the Affordable Care Act for the last 30 seconds. Obviously we have to make it like a three-minute video where most of it is talking about Affordable Care Act.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018No, that makes it not cool anymore.\u2019 It just makes it an ad and no one will share an ad,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one cares about an ad. So I kind of put my foot down and said, \u2018No it\u2019s got to be this ratio of jokes to Affordable Care Act. And I wish more people would learn that lesson when it comes to doing stuff in politics.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it worked. The episode premiered on Funny or Die on March 11, 2014, about three weeks before the extended deadline to sign up for insurance. Quickly, the video garnered tens of millions or views and Funny or Die became the top referrer to HealthCare.gov, which saw a 40 percent traffic increase the day it came out.\n\n\u201c The video certainly helped drive signups,\u201d Keenan acknowledges, adding, \u201cThe media environment had changed so much so quickly that people were no longer getting their trusted information solely from the legacy news outlets, but from all sorts of places. And so we were trying to go everywhere to reach people where they were.\u201d\n\nA few days later, Galifanakis sent Keenan a thank-you email followed up by a bucket of beers while Funny or Die gave the speechwriter a gold-painted fern statue that reads \u201cCody Keenan: Congratulations on 20 million views and 8 million signups!\u201d\n\nThe Obama video was such a success that two years later, Hillary Clinton specifically requested to make an appearance on Between Two Ferns.\n\nTo Clinton\u2019s \u201ccredit,\u201d Aukerman says that her campaign staff imposed no restrictions on them when she came in to do the show during her 2016 run. \u201cShe wanted to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had heard Barack Obama wanted to do it and found out later he had no idea what he was doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo yeah, they let us do what we wanted to do and just made it funny,\u201d Aukerman continues. \u201cNow did it work for them like it worked for the ACA? I guess not! We maybe even hurt her chances.\u201d\n\nNow that they\u2019ve turned the web series into a Netflix movie, Galifianakis has suggested to Aukerman that this could be \u201cthe end of Between Two Ferns.\u201d But they are not ruling out the possibility of hosting the Democratic presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nAukerman says they would only do it if they felt like there was enough material for Galifianakis to make fun of. \u201cIf they had a campaign that was like Justin Bieber\u2019s career then sure,\u201d he says. \u201cBut who knows?\u201d\n\nSubscribe to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts here.
