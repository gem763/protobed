We appreciate the support the public has given our UAW members and their families as they stand up for all of us.\u201d\n\nRebecca Cook/Reuters\n\nA spokesperson for GM said \"talks continue and our goal remains to reach an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our business.\"\n\nOn Sunday, striking workers at a GM plant in Detroit were visited by 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who joined the picket lines.\n\n\"When unions win, all workers win,\" Warren tweeted, adding that she was \"proud\" to stand alongside the UAW.\n\nThe workers of @UAW are fighting for fair wages and good benefits\u2014and I have their backs.

Despite the high-profile attention, the progress on the negotiations has been extremely slow.\n\nIn his most recent statement from last Thursday, UAW vice president Terry Dittes said \u201csome progress has been made\u201d but many issues \u201cremain unresolved.\u201d\n\nBryan Woolston/Reuters\n\nUnion leaders have argued that GM workers deserved a bigger slice of the company's profits, which they say have totaled $35 billion in North America over the last three years. Union members are calling for higher wages, retention of a health insurance plan in which workers pay about 4% of the costs, an improved pension and assurances that GM -- the maker of Buick, Cadillac, GMC and Chevrolet -- will not close four plants in Maryland, Ohio and Michigan.\n\nGM has argued that its offer to the union \"prioritizes employees, communities and builds a stronger future for all.\"\n\n\"It includes improved wages and health care benefits, over $7B in U.S. investments and 5,400 jobs,\" according to a post on GM's Twitter page.\n\nRebecca Cook/Reuters\n\nAs the strike continues, stakes are especially high as GM announced last week it was no longer covering striking workers' health insurance costs.\n\nAs workers were on the picket lines Monday night, GM decided to terminate insurance coverage for thousands of UAW members and their families.\n\n\n\nThe UAW activated the strike fund to help fill the gap and ensure that no one loses their care. pic.twitter.com/1aJPw7wAta \u2014 UAW (@UAW) September 18, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, the ripple effects of the strike in the U.S. are being felt by suppliers who have started eyeing layoffs and even in neighboring Canada where over a thousand workers have been temporarily laid off at a GM plant in Oshawa as a result of the strike.", "description": "Both the United Autoworkers Union and General Motors say negotiations continue, but there remains no clear end in sight.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/gm-strike-01-rt-jt-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
