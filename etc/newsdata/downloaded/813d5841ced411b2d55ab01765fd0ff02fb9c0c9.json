He was chief finance officer of Game Digital from 2015 to 2018 and held the same role at House of Fraser for the previous eight years.\n\nGifford is also currently chairman of accessories brand Radley and is a non-executive director of Ann Summers' owner GGI.\n\nHis appointment comes as Debenhams is going through a restructuring, having launched a Company's Voluntary Arrangement in spring and announced the planned closure of 50 of its 166 UK stores.\n\nLast month, it won a High Court challenge against landlords who tried to scupper its plans to close stores, reduce rents and cut jobs in a bid to revive its fortunes.\n\nBillionaire retail tycoon Mike Ashley, who runs Sports Direct, helped finance Debenhams' landlords' efforts to overturn the department store group's restructuring plan.\n\nThe first 22 stores are set to close down in January next year and 1,200 staff would be affected by the first phase.\n\nGifford said: 'I am excited about the opportunity to play a part in building a successful future for one of the UK's best-known retail businesses.\n\n'We are assembling a strong group of board members and I am looking forward to working with the team as we implement the necessary changes to deliver a sustainable and profitable future.'", "description": "Mark Gifford\u00a0will help to lead the turnaround of the department store chain, which fell into administration earlier this year.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Press Association", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
