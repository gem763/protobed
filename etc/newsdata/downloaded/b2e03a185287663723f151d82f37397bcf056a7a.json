(CBS4)\u2013 He\u2019s a llama that goes by a few different names, originally he was \u201cIke\u201d the Instagram star, but now he\u2019s \u201cLucky Louie.\u201d Louis used to be a pack llama in Yellowstone, but that wasn\u2019t going so well for him.\n\nHe had an abscessed tooth and didn\u2019t like being harnessed because it hurt him. So, he escaped!\n\n\u201cThey tried to recapture him but he didn\u2019t let them,\u201d said Susi Huelsmeyer-Sinay.\n\nTired of his llama drama, his old owners let him go and Ike began living his best life in Yellowstone, but between predators and the winter weather he was in a lot of danger.\n\n\u201cHe would not have survived the winter in Yellowstone,\u201d said Susi.\n\nThat\u2019s when Susi, a llama owner in Montana, decided she needed to do something. Others had attempted to wrangle and rope him but no harness would hold Ike. So, she took a gentler approach.\n\nSusi took two of her own llamas and hiked up to Louis Lake where he was last seen, \u201cWhen he saw my llamas, he came running.\u201d\n\nIke\u2019s owners let Susi adopt him and she named him Louis after Louis Lake where she found him. All she had to do was take care of his toothache.\n\n\u201cAnd I treated it with antibiotics hoping it would clear up,\u201d said Susi.\n\nThe injury was worse than she thought. Instead of one abscessed tooth it was three and Louis needed surgery. Susi turned to the experts at the Colorado State Veterinary Teaching Hospital who fixed Louis up, but it wasn\u2019t easy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty involved. I think it was a four or five-hour long procedure,\u201d said a representative from CSU.\n\nToday Louis is on his way to recovery and Susi hopes they can go back to Yellowstone soon.\n\n\u201cI hope that we will go packing in Yellowstone next year.\u201d", "description": "He's a llama that goes by a few different names, originally he was \u201cIke\u201d the Instagram star, but now he's \u201cLucky Louie.\u201d Louis used to be a pack llama in Yellowstone, but that wasn't going so well for him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://denver.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909806/2019/09/LEWIS-THE-LLAME-5PKG_frame_0.jpg?w=1440", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
