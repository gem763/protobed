The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued.\" She stressed that that the judgment was unanimous among the 11 judges.\n\nThe government has previously said it would \"abide by the ruling\" of the Supreme Court. Johnson is currently in New York for the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nAnnouncing the news to his party's annual conference in Brighton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the court had decided Johnson \"acted wrongly\" in suspending parliament. \"It demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him and the Supreme Court therefore passes the baton to the speaker to recall parliament,\" he said, adding he would be demanding an immediate recall.\n\nSpeaking outside the Supreme Court, Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry, who brought one of the cases that judges were ruling on, called the judgment, \"an absolutely momentous decision. The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that parliament has not been prorogued.\"\n\n\"This is a huge victory for the rule of law and for democracy,\" she added.\n\nThe ruling comes following a three-day hearing at which two appeals were heard \u2014 one from campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, the second from the government.\n\nMiller was appealing against the English High Court's decision that the prorogation was \"purely political\" and not a matter for the courts.\n\nThe government was appealing against the ruling by Scotland's Court of Session, its highest civil court, that the prorogation was \"unlawful\" and had been used to \"stymie\" parliament. The challenge in the Scottish court was brought by a cross-party group of MPs and peers.\n\nMiller called the result, \"a win for parliament sovereignty, the separation of power and the independence of our courts.\"\n\n\"MPs should turn up for work tomorrow and get on with scrutinizing this government,\" she said.", "description": "Judges ruled that as a result it was as if the decision to prorogue parliament had not happened.", "authors": ["Annabelle Dickson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169763971-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
