If anything, it\u2019s going to get harder before it gets easier.\u201d\n\nThe ambitious project stems from a white paper unveiled in June detailing plans to build a blockchain that will support a \u201clow-volatility\u201d cryptocurrency called Libra. The currency would be backed by short-term government securities and fiat currency, which users would deposit into the reserve when they exchange their money for units of Libra.\n\nMarcus said he \u201crespect[s]\u201d the seven companies\u2019 decisions to leave the project and thanked the companies for having \u201cthe courage to look at potentially disrupting themselves.\u201d\n\nFacebook's blockchain lead David Marcus. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier More\n\n\u201cBut I also understand that they also have a responsibility to their shareholders and to their stakeholders and they were under a lot of pressure,\u201d Marcus said, adding that companies outside of the formalized Libra Association council will still be able to offer services on the platform.\n\nOn Monday, the Libra Association was formally founded in Geneva, Switzerland with the 21 remaining initial members, including Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT), Coinbase, Spotify (SPOT), and Vodafone. Facebook (FB) is spearheading Libra\u2019s development (via its subsidiary, Calibra) but has said decisions regarding the blockchain will be made by the association at large.\n\nIn addition to announcing its board of directors (which includes Marcus, in addition to representatives from Andreessen Horowitz, Kiva Microfunds, PayU, and Xapo Holdings), the group on Monday announced that over 1,500 \u201centities\u201d have indicated interest in joining the group.\n\nThe association said 180 entities already met the preliminary membership criteria.\n\nMarcus said now that the association is formal, the next steps will be creating finding \u201cmore diversity\u201d in its membership. Per the white paper, the goal is to have about 100 members of the association by its target launch in the first half of 2020.\n\nMarcus said regulatory matters have not been behind the seven departures from the project, despite commentary from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin assuming that \u201csome of the partners got concerned and dropped out\u201d over rules like anti-money laundering standards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fleshing out all of the regulatory requirements and oversight required for this to operate but nothing has changed,\u201d Marcus said.\n\nMarcus said the target launch date in the first half of 2020 is \u201can ambitious timeline that becomes an external forcing function for everyone.\u201d But he reiterated, as he did to lawmakers in testimony earlier this year, that the project will take its time and wait until it gets regulatory approval before launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a great deal from this process,\u201d Marcus said.\n\nBrian Cheung is a reporter covering the banking industry and the intersection of finance and policy for Yahoo Finance.
