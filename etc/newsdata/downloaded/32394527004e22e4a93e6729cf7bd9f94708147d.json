He told Bild: 'For me, he is a stranger in the team.\n\n'I cannot remember a good situation [he's produced] in attack. If you have such a player in the team and he does not show any special moments, then, of course, you get problems because in the defence he only counts as half a player.\n\n'He has 30 or 35 games left so he has to start sometime [to show good performances]. He is still on loan from Barca until the end of the season.'\n\nCoutinho again failed to deliver the kind of cutting edge he's provided in the past during Bayern's 3-2 win at Olympiacos on Tuesday and Nico Kovac had to defend his performance after the match.", "description": "Philippe Coutinho looks like a 'stranger' in the Bayern Munich team and 'only counts as half a player' at the moment, according to Dietmar Hamann.", "authors": ["Will Griffee For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20126938-0-image-a-120_1571913645800.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
