Here's a look inside their whirlwind romance.\n\nThe couple confirmed they were expecting a second child back in March, 10 months after Kerr had given birth to a baby boy named Hart, in honor of Spiegel's grandfather. Kerr also has a third son, an eight-year-old named Flynn, who she had with her ex-husband, actor Orlando Bloom.\n\nSpiegel and Kerr have been married since May 2017. The couple first met in 2015 at a dinner for Louis Vuitton in Los Angeles. That night, the person sitting next to them \u2014 Harper's Bazaar editor-in-chief Glenda Bailey \u2014 said to Kerr, \"I bet you two are going to get married.\"\n\nThe couple, worth a combined $3.5 billion, has kept their lives relatively private. Spiegel said in an interview last year that the couple limits Flynn \u2014 Kerr's eight-year-old \u2014 to 1.5 hours of screen time per week.\n\nKerr revealed in an interview last month she mops the floors of the couple's $12 million home with hot water and eucalyptus oil, and turns off almost all of the home's electricity at night \u2014 which she likened to \"going camping.\" Kerr also shared that she has a radiation-blocking sticker on the back of her phone, a nod to a controversial theory that cell phones emit harmful rays that could cause cancer and make people sick.", "description": "Kerr shared with her over 12 million followers that she had given birth to a baby boy.
