He instead urged the euro zone to adopt an expansionary fiscal stance to revive growth.\n\n($1 = 0.9031 euros)", "description": "Italy's economy minister Roberto Gualtieri said on Saturday that privatisation targets set by the previous Italian government were \"unrealistic\", and warned the sale of government shares in public companies should be handled with caution.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
