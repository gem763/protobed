I don't think anyone in the industry can defend this.\"\n\nThe Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses said they had been monitoring one abattoir north of Brisbane for two years and claimed it slaughtered 500 horses a month.\n\n\"It's an abattoir that kills horses for human consumption,\" the group's Elio Celotto told ABC, which broadcast secretly filmed footage it claimed showed workers beating and abusing horses.\n\n\"(The meat) goes to various countries in Europe, it goes to Japan, and Russia's a big importer as well,\" added Celotto.\n\nThe ABC said it forensically cross-matched horses slaughtered there, using microchips and brandings, to the industry's official online record of thoroughbreds, the Australian Stud Book.\n\nIt revealed around 300 racehorses, with combined prize money of almost Aus$5 million (US$3.4 million), went through the abattoir in just 22 days.\n\nRacing Victoria chief executive Giles Thompson said he was \"sickened by the horrific images\", which emerged just days ahead of the world's richest turf race, The Everest in Sydney, and the annual Melbourne Cup next month.\n\n\"Equine welfare is a non-negotiable for the Australian racing industry and the goal of ensuring a home for every healthy thoroughbred as it exits the racing industry must remain a priority for all,\" he said.\n\nCurrently, when thoroughbred horses retire their owners must inform Racing Australia of their plans for the animal.\n\nBut the sport's peak body said in a statement that any subsequent change of ownership once it left the industry could not be legally tracked.\n\nTo counter this, it is backing a National Horse Traceability Register, which is currently being considered by the national government.\n\n\"A National Horse Register would fill this gap, allow federal and state authorities access to ownership and location information and help improve equine welfare outcomes nationally,\" it said.", "description": "Australia's thoroughbred industry was reeling Friday after an investigation revealed the mass, and sometimes inhumane, killing of thousands of retired...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/01/wire-19865244-1571359976-116_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
