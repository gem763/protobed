(Source: lawsuit)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe JUUL e-cigarette is a sleek, high-tech design. It looks like a USB flash drive and it can charge in a computer. It is about the size and shape of a pack of chewing gum; it is small enough to fit in a closed hand,\u201d the suit states. \u201cJUUL is easy to conceal from parents and teachers.\u201d\n\nJuul's marketing campaign has since reached 20.5 million minors, the suit states.\n\nThe Manhattan Supreme Court suit was also filed against Altria Group, Inc., which owns a 35 percent stake in the brand, cigarette company Philip Morris USA Inc. and New York Smoke Shop, which is located on 9th Street in Manhattan and is accused of selling to the teen. The Fays are seeking unspecified damages.\n\n\u201cMimicking Big Tobacco\u2019s past marketing practices, Defendants prey on youth the recruit replacements for financial gain,\u201d the suit states.\n\nThe e-cigarette company also allegedly deceptively claimed its products were \u201cnon-addictive nicotine delivery systems, or less addictive nicotine products than cigarettes\u201d despite knowing otherwise.\n\nHad the teen \u201cbeen adequately informed and not intentionally deceived by Defendant, she would not have purchased or used JUUL products.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also indicates the teen was physically hurt as a result of her e-cigarette use, but does not provide specific details pertaining to the injury.\n\nIn a statement emailed to FOX Business, a Juul Labs spokesperson said, in part, that the suit \"largely copies and pastes unfounded allegations previously raised in other lawsuits, which we have been actively contesting for over a year.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"Our product has always only been intended to be a viable alternative for the one billion current adult smokers in the world,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have never marketed to youth and do not want any non-nicotine users to try our products. We have launched an aggressive action plan to combat underage use as it is antithetical to our mission.\"", "description": "The e-cigarette company\u2019s marketing campaign has since reached 20.5 million minors.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/juul-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
