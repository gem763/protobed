Blame it on the air", "language": "en", "text": "Losing hair? Blame it on the air How on earth are air pollution and hair loss linked? It seems impossible, but read on if you\u2019ve been losing hair\u2026\n\nAir pollution and hair loss can be linked. ~\n\nWhen the seasons change, it\u2019s likely that you might be shedding a bit of hair in the shower. Previous studies have linked seasonal changes to \"moulting\" in humans, and it\u2019s usually nothing to worry about.\n\nBut new research, presented at the 28th EADV Congress in Madrid, shows for the first time that exposure to common air pollutants known as particulate matter (PM) is linked to hair loss in humans.\n\nWhat does air have to do with hair?\n\nThe research was conducted using cells from the human scalp at the base of the follicles (human follicle dermal papilla cells or HFDPC) and exposing them to various particulate matters such as dust and diesel particulate, commonly found in polluted air.\n\nResearchers then performed a process on the cells to detect a specific protein that helps the hair grow. It was shown that the presence of PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micrometres) decreased the level of that protein.\n\nThe study also revealed that the levels of three other proteins, which are responsible for hair growth and hair retention, were decreased by PM10-like dust and diesel particulate.\n\nWhy does particulate matter matter?\n\nParticulate matter (PM) can be described as a mix of solid particles and droplets found in the air. PM is divided into categories based on their diameter. PM10 is considered a major pollutant and is linked to many other conditions besides hair loss. PM10 includes burning fossil fuels, petrol, diesel, coal, oil and biomass.\n\nLead researcher, Hyuk Chul Kwon from the Future Science Research Centre in the Republic of Korea, stated in the news report: \"While the link between air pollution and serious diseases such as cancer, COPD and cardiovascular diseases is well established, there is little to no research on the effect of particulate matter exposure on the human skin and hair in particular. Our research explains the mode of action of air pollutants on human follicle dermal papilla cells, showing how the most common air pollutants lead to hair loss.\"\n\nProtect yourself against air pollution\n\nWhether you are concerned about hair loss or not, air pollution can also increase your risk of respiratory allergies and conditions. While those who live and work in highly-populated industrialised urban areas can\u2019t entirely escape air pollution, there are ways to contain your exposure:\n\nAvoid exercising (running and walking) near traffic-dense areas such as freeways or busy roads.\n\nChange your clothes, shower and wash your hair as soon as you come home from work to avoid spreading particles around the house.\n\nInvest in houseplants to increase the air quality inside your home.\n\nAvoid burning gas and wood without proper ventilation.\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "How on earth are air pollution and hair loss linked?
