I certainly don't believe that anymore,\" Reid, a Nevada Democrat who served in Congress for decades until his retirement in 2016, told \"Axe Files\" host David Axelrod in an interview airing Saturday at 7 p.m. ET on CNN.\n\nThe former Democratic leader had criticized Trump in harsh and colorful terms , calling him a \"spoiled brat,\" \"a con artist\" and a \"human leech who will bleed the country\" in comments on the Senate floor in 2016.\n\nBut Reid -- a savvy political operator whose moves to reshape Senate procedures, like his elimination of filibusters for most nominations by presidents, were criticized by Republicans during his time in Congress -- acknowledged in the interview Trump's strategy in discrediting Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry into his actions with Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't think he's, intellectually, a powerhouse but he is basically a very, very smart man. No matter what the subject, any argument he involves himself in, it's on his terms. You're always arguing against him. He never, never, is willing to debate an issue on terms that aren't his,\" Reid told Axelrod.\n\nRead More", "description": "Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has a new assessment of President Donald Trump as \"a very, very smart man\" who won't be easy for Democrats to defeat in the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161212120636-harry-reid-october-2016-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
