manager", "language": "en", "text": "London (AFP) \u2013 The spectacular fall from grace of Britain\u2019s star investor Neil Woodford has tarnished the reputation of London\u2019s City finance district and hurt market confidence, according to analysts.\n\nFew commentators imagined that Woodford Investment Management, which once boasted billions of pounds in assets under management, would spectacularly collapse this month having taken on too much risk.\n\nThe group\u2019s flagship Equity Income fund was suspended in June to stop it haemorrhaging cash.\n\nWoodford was then forced to quit and liquidate the fund on October 15.\n\nOne day later, Woodford quit his two other funds in what he described as a \u201chighly painful decision\u201d \u2014 and added that the whole business would be wound up.\n\nThe news has sparked big losses for Woodford\u2019s customers who include pension funds, wealthy individuals and other fund managers.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Shaken to core\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cWe have seen the complete demise of the most famous fund manager the UK has seen for years,\u201d Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at brokerage Willis Owen, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cInvestors knew the scenario was bad but the indication from Woodford thus far had been that the (Equity Income) fund would reopen,\u201d Lowcock said.\n\n\u201cThis collapse\u2026 will shake the funds industry to its core.\u201d\n\nWoodford, 59, forged his name as the nation\u2019s top stockpicker in a glittering 30-year career in the asset management business, most of which was at investment manager Invesco Perpetual.\n\nHe had been regarded as a safe pair of hands after reportedly guiding his funds away from the dotcom bubble crisis in the early 2000s, successfully backing traditional stocks like tobacco instead of technology.\n\nThe outspoken Woodford \u2014 nicknamed \u201cBritain\u2019s Warren Buffett\u201d by media after the legendary US investment guru \u2014 also carved out a reputation as an activist investor willing to hold company CEOs to account.\n\nIn 2014, Woodford established his Woodford Investment Management in an industrial estate on the outskirts of Oxford, which earned him the new moniker the \u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d.\n\nAt its peak in 2017, the business had total assets of \u00a314 billion ($17.9 billion) under management.\n\nYet five years later, the business model hit the rocks as a series of disastrous investments turned sour.\n\nIn particular, Woodford had ploughed cash into a number of unlisted healthcare and technology companies, as well as poor stock market bets.\n\nAs more and more investors started asking for their money back, Woodford encountered difficulty raising sufficient cash quickly enough.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Investment scandal\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe Financial Times described Woodford as Europe\u2019s biggest investment scandal for a decade, labelling him the star fund manager who fell to earth.\n\nIndustry veteran Jonathan Little argued the collapse would stop the hero-worshipping of investment bigwigs like Woodford.\n\n\u201cIf there is anything good to come out of this, it is that investors will move away from the industry\u2019s Hollywood-style culture of star worship,\u201d Little told the FT.\n\nDarius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Investment Finance, said the sector now needed to regain trust.\n\n\u201cThe whole situation has been awful for investors\u2026 and damaging for the industry,\u201d McDermott said.\n\n\u201cAt a time when people should be saving more, not less, and when UK equities are so out of favour, it is worrying that so much trust has been lost.\n\n\u201cWe now need to work hard to get that trust back,\u201d he added.\n\nThe sector has, however, attracted fierce criticism, including from the Bank of England governor Mark Carney.\n\n\u201cThese funds are built on a lie, which is that you can have daily liquidity for assets that fundamentally aren\u2019t liquid,\u201d he told lawmakers in June.\n\nIn Britain, an estimated \u00a39.0 trillion of assets are overseen by fund managers, making it the second biggest market after the United States.\n\nUner Nabi, financial services associate partner at EY accountancy group, said the furore could even help the sector in the long term.\n\n\u201cAny short-term reputational damage is likely to be more than offset by the overall progress being made by managers and the regulators to protect customers,\u201d he told AFP.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 The spectacular
