Further, she's baffled by the idea that conservatives treat her fairly and nicely.\n\n\u201cWhat does it say that Fox News is nicer to me than the lefties are?\" she told Sinclair's Eric Bolling during a break. \"What does it say that the conservatives are nicer to me?\"\n\n\"It's such a bizarre world. You know I'm such a lefty. I mean, I'm a serious lefty but they are so -- I understand why people on the Right called them godless,\" she continued.\n\n.@marwilliamson: \u201cWhat does it say that the conservatives are nicer to me? I\u2019m a serious lefty but they are so \u2014 I understand why people on the right called them godless \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s like, I didn\u2019t think the left was as mean as the right, they are.\u201d pic.twitter.com/0iXkWPRdAW \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 12, 2019\n\nIn the past few weeks, Williamson has lamented mocking of prayer from the Left and argued her party should be more accepting.\n\nPrayer is a power of the mind, and it is neither bizarre nor unintelligent. People of faith belong in the Democratic Party, and will be necessary to the effort if we\u2019re to win in 2020. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) September 4, 2019\n\nI was born and raised in Texas so I\u2019ve seen it. Millions of people today are praying that Dorian turn away from land, and treating those people with mockery or condescension because they believe it could help is part of how the overly secularized Left has lost lots of voters. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) September 4, 2019\n\nBut don't get your hopes up, she's still on their team. She eventually went on to also say, \"I didn\u2019t think the Left was as mean as the Right, they are.\"", "description": ".10/02/2019 12:28:52PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/211/ffbb8b7a-d434-4038-b93b-f911d3d3e11b.png"}
