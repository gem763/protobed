Those who do not work in the brand, were the loudest in their disapproval; the actress Debra Messing, a noted nemesis of the president, tweeted against the photo op, as did celebrity stylists Karla Welch, Elizabeth Stewart, Alexandra Mandelkorn, and makeup artist Rachel Goodman.\n\nShannon Coulter, founder of the #GrabYourWallet Alliance, which tracks companies profiting from the administration's policies, called for a boycott of LVMH. After The New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman reported on the snafu, a few shoppers replied to her tweet promising to throw their Vuitton wallets away or return their newly-purchased handbags.\n\nBut despite the chatter, other big names who work under the LVMH name, like Fenty\u2019s Rihanna, Givenchy\u2019s Clare Waight Keller, Fendi\u2019s Silvia Fendi, Marc Jacobs (the man), Dior\u2019s Maria Grazia Chirui, and Kenzo\u2019s Felipe Oliveira Baptista, stayed silent. Those creative directors did not respond to inquiries from The Daily Beast.\n\nOnly one designer went rogue\u2014Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, artistic director for womenswear at Vuitton. He punctuated his weekend by posting a screenshot of the album cover for Evelyn Thomas\u2019 1984 synth classic \u201cHigh Energy.\u201d Ghesquiere captioned the photo, \u201cStanding against any political action. I am a fashion designer refusing this association #trumpisajoke #homophobia.\u201d\n\nA representative for Ghesqui\u00e8re declined The Daily Beast\u2019s interview request. Friedman called Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s post \u201ca pretty radical move\u201d and labeled him the potential \u201cposter boy for fashion-against-Trump.\u201d\n\nMaybe. It\u2019s admirable that Ghesqui\u00e8re would speak out while most of his peers stay silent. Most people understand the schism between corporate higher-ups and creatives. Ghesqui\u00e8re didn\u2019t have to say anything, but by doing so he\u2019s leading the dissent\u2014if taking a photo of the Spotify song one is listening to and hitting \u201cpost\u201d on Instagram can be considered a protest.\n\nWith no angry, wealthy mobs throwing a match and gasoline into a trash can full of shoulder bags, Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s statement may very well be it. As Robin Givhan of The Washington Post wrote, LVMH seems to accept Trump with a \u201cpublic shrug.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ribbon-cutting was jarring in its utter nonchalance, in its unflinching fealty to corporate normalcy during these most abnormal times,\u201d Givhan wrote. \u201cCan there be neutral ground when the players are a president who has made women in general, along with immigrants and members of the LGBT community, feel as though they are under siege, and a billionaire mogul who reaps tremendous profits from those very people?\u201d\n\nBut yet, as those who dismiss fashion as frivolous are always quick to point out these days, there are more pressing reasons to call out Trump. Impeachment could be near, his administration is in shambles, and more than 10,000 Kurds have died trying to fight the Islamic State.\n\nDo we really need to talk about purses at a time like this? Especially if those pricey bags will now come with \u201cMade in the USA\u201d tags, giving jobs to a reported 150 Texans, according to the Dallas Morning News? (As part of singing the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cPledge to American Workers,\u201d LVMH promised to open 1,000 more positions over the next five years.)\n\n\u201c Louis Vuitton is a 150 year-old brand that is so coveted and desired, so expensive, that people probably choose to forgive and forget \u201d\n\nAnother important question: do those who can afford the leather goods, which retail from $740 for a monogrammed wallet to $2900 for a \u201clightweight and feminine\u201d backpack, care at all about who christened the workshop that made it?\n\n\u201cConsumers choose to forget or turn a deaf ear because they don\u2019t want their brand spoken about in a negative light, and they want to own their products without any kind of baggage,\u201d Laurence Newell, managing director of the Americas for consultancy company Brand Finance told The Daily Beast. \u201cLouis Vuitton is a 150 year-old brand that is so coveted and desired, so expensive, that people probably choose to forgive and forget.\u201d\n\nThe fashion establishment has a spotty history when it comes time to stand up to its rich, but perhaps ethically compromised, benefactors. Just this summer, The Washington Post revealed that billionaire real estate developer Stephen Ross and his wife Kara would host two events in the Hamptons that raised $12 million for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nAt the time, Kara sat on the board of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Though some in the industry called for Kara\u2019s ousting, chairman Tom Ford told WWD those requests were \u201ctotally wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo have done that would have been the same kind of censorship that our current administration tries to do with the press \u2014 tries to manipulate, in a sense, real freedom of speech,\u201d Ford said.\n\nAny debates over the validity of this argument were rendered mute when Ross exited the board in September to make room for new and more diverse members. As reported by The Daily Beast, Stephen Ross\u2019 seat on the board of arts venue The Shed led to criticism from New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson. None of the New York Fashion Week shows expected to be held at the Shed took place.\n\nIs it all that surprising that Trump, a notorious showboat who joked at the ribbon cutting that shopping Vuitton \u201ccost me a lot of money over the years,\u201d would be a fan of the brand? With its manic, repeated logo and penchant for slapping huge shiny buckles over cow hide, LV has worked hard to align itself with the ostentatious.\n\nTo quote one astute Twitter user, \u201cNo authentically fashionable person carries LV. And I felt that way *before* the Trump pic.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump helped cut a ribbon at the new Louis Vuitton plant in Texas.
