During a conversation in July with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, he asked for help in the investigation of his likely opponent in 2020, Joe Biden, whose son had business dealings in the country. On Tuesday, Nancy Pelosi announced that impeachment proceedings would finally begin.\n\nWhite House tried to cover up Trump's Ukraine conversation, whistleblower alleges Read more\n\nBut the release of the conversation summary or \u201cmemcon\u201d between Trump and Zelenskiy on Wednesday left things a little hazier than expected.\n\nTrump did ask for a favour, but it was for help in his obsessive quest to prove that he won the presidency fair and square. And while he later raised the prospect of an investigation into Biden, at no time did he dangle military contracts he had put on hold as an inducement. Meanwhile, Zelenskiy was more interested in possible future deals. There was a request from Trump for a quo \u2013 but no quid, exactly.\n\nIf the summary is accurate, what we are left with is not savoury, but neither is it definitive. It has nonetheless set in train another burst of excited commentary. What this excitement really represents is a further round in the dramatic cycle of argument about the meaning of Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral victory.\n\nFor liberal and conservative centrists, inured to taking turns in power for decades, Trump\u2019s rise in the Republican party and his success in beating Hillary Clinton within the appalling rules of the American game was the real affront. Blindsided by their ejection by an incoherent nonentity and sexual predator, this coalition of long-governing elites, from liberal technocrats to \u201cnever-Trump\u201d conservatives, has declared war on the president, embracing any bad pretext or good reason to call for his early ouster.\n\nThere are certainly many reasons to wish Trump out of office. He is incompetent and inflammatory, and his policies are racist and anti-poor. But behind the stance of permanent alarm and outrage adopted by the political establishment is a strong sense that what really irks them is that US democracy, such as it is, has toppled them from power. And after pining for so long for Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to be their redemption, they have now pinned their hopes on a \u201cmemcon ex machina\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Leftwing members of Congress such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders have long been in favour of impeaching Trump. But they have not made it a daily obsession.\u2019 Photograph: Zach Gibson/Getty Images\n\nThe trouble from the beginning, and one reason for the constant repetition of the drama, is that Trump\u2019s very conquest of the Republican party meant it was always going to be nearly impossible to convince enough members of Congress to put this presidency down early. For every chorus of dismay and shock from never-Trump centrists there is an always-Trump faction prepared to excuse him when he comes near the line of malfeasance or crosses over it \u2013 and the chorus knows it. Both sides have deserved one another at every stage.\n\nFor all their appeals to enduring moral values, whether US exceptionalism or legal principle, the centrists are deploying a transparent strategy to return to power. Trump\u2019s shambolic presidency somehow seems less unsavoury than the fact that neither of these sides are able to admit how massively his election signified the failure of their policies, from endless war to economic inequality.\n\nLeftwing members of Congress such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders have long been in favour of impeaching Trump. But they have not made it a daily obsession. Even as Washington teemed with talking points about the phone call, Ocasio-Cortez introduced a bold plan to fight poverty; Sanders proposed a new wealth tax the day before.\n\nProgressives are right to worry that what matters most is not whether Trump committed an \u201cimpeachable offence\u201d (which means no more than that enough members of the House of Representatives will vote to indict him), but instead what political vision Democrats can rally behind to win the country, rigged system and all. Given the importance of that question, the current debate about whether to impeach Trump, for all the melodrama around it now, pales in comparison.\n\nCentrists simply want to return to the status quo interrupted by Trump, their reputations laundered by their courageous opposition to his mercurial reign, and their policies restored to credibility. Meanwhile, rightwing Republicans hope to benefit from his ascendancy, doubling down on tax cuts. No wonder progressives\u2019 greatest fear is allowing the first group to return to the failed policies that produced Trump himself, and the second to capitalise on his rise to entrench their rule indefinitely.\n\nAl Green, a Democratic congressman from Texas who was a lonely early proponent of impeaching Trump, commented the other day that his approach was vital precisely because it would help to win the next election. In his press conference on Wednesday, the president jeered in return. Trumpeting his own success \u2013 however unearned \u2013 in promoting economic growth, he interpreted impeachment as the strategy of a party that has nothing else to offer. \u201cAll of these people focusing on the witch-hunt because they can\u2019t beat us at the ballot,\u201d he exclaimed with some delight.\n\nPelosi's gamble: impeachment inquiry exposes Trump but carries risks for Democrats Read more\n\nWho is right \u2013 Green or Trump? The Ukraine affair shows that the biggest risk to the American people is that centrists link impeachment to a reinstatement of one set of failed prescriptions, while the right repulses the attempt to oust the president and rules under equally dead-end policies. And it shows that progressives must link opposition to Trump to a broader strategy to bring the country a convincing new politics of their own.\n\n\u2022 Samuel Moyn is a professor of law and history at Yale and the author, most recently, of Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World", "description": "Ousting Trump so that centrists can return to power misses the point.
