Show Hide A 62-year-old Labour veteran who joined the party in 1974 and worked for Labour icon Tony Benn during his deputy leadership campaign in the 1980s. Lansman served as director of operations for Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign. After Corbyn was elected as the leader of the Labour party in 2015, Lansman founded Momentum, a pro-Corbyn campaign group.\n\nMomentum, often described as a \u2018party within a party\u2019, has radically transformed the Labour party over the last four years. Local groups have challenged party orthodoxies and national membership rules, and fought to get their activists selected. \u201cI don\u2019t want the Labour party to become a faction fight,\u201d Lansman said in a 2016 interview with the Guardian. \u201cWhat I want is a level playing field. I want the Labour party to be able to have a democratic debate.\u201d But in recent weeks, Lansman, and Momentum, are back in the news for being key figures behind another Labour party civil war. Lansman was behind the move to scrap Labour\u2019s 40-year-old student wing last week, arguing the group needs reforming and had not paid its affiliation fees. Critics described the move as a cynical attempt to shut down a \u201cmoderate\u201d wing of the party. Lansman also tabled a last-minute motion at the NEC on Friday night calling for Watson\u2019s job to be scrapped. The motion was withdrawn after Corbyn intervened.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to ask the public whether they are prepared to leave with the best deal that can be secured. Or whether they wouldn\u2019t rather remain in the EU. The people must have the final say.\n\n\u201cA referendum in which \u2018remain\u2019 should \u2013 and will \u2013 be on the ballot paper. Along with the best leave deal that can be secured. We owe it to those who want to leave to secure that leave deal and put it to them in a referendum.\n\nStarmer chaired the late-night meeting on Sunday that resulted in two motions being drafted. Only the one which closely echoed the NEC\u2019s statement was passed.\n\nEarlier, Momentum founder Jon Lansman had urged members to vote with their conscience, complaining that the NEC, of which he is a member, had not had the opportunity to scrutinise the wording of the statement properly. \u201cThere was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership,\u201d he said.\n\nJon Lansman (@jonlansman) 1/2 I'm completely supportive of Jeremy's leadership but I\u2019m incredibly disappointed with the process by which today\u2019s NEC statement on Brexit was produced. There was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership\n\nDisappointed remain campaigners pointed out that Labour in Wales and Scotland have already adopted an anti-Brexit stance \u2013 and key members of the frontbench are on their side.", "description": "Brighton conference delegates reject call for clear anti-Brexit campaign ahead of next general election", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/942e50fa468fdbc4e21319c1e5842a6789273432/0_122_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2396a7f0d6d7f0dfbed7ede707a99e74", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
