The Greenwich, Conn.-based online brokerage is expected to publicly announce the decision to switch its listing exchange soon.\n\nRepresentatives of IEX didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. An Interactive Brokers spokeswoman said she couldn\u2019t immediately comment. Nasdaq declined to comment.\n\nInteractive Brokers became IEX\u2019s first listed company a year ago. It is now leaving because of concerns about how its shares have traded on IEX, including wider bid-ask spreads, the people said. Such spreads are the difference between the buying and selling price of a stock. When they widen, investors pay more to trade in and out of a company\u2019s shares.\n\nIEX had worked for several years to break into listings. Representatives of IEX approached hundreds of companies as part of the listings effort, including household names such as Amazon.com Inc. and air carrier United Continental Holdings Inc., The Wall Street Journal reported last year.\n\nIEX offered NYSE- and Nasdaq-listed companies steep discounts on their listing fees if they switched over. But the effort was marred by delays and the IEX listings team went through several management changes.\n\nIn the listings business, companies pay fees to an exchange for it to be the primary marketplace for their shares. NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and Nasdaq earned a combined $734 million from listings last year, according to the companies. A third exchange group, Cboe Global Markets Inc., has a listings business, but it is focused on exchange-traded funds rather than corporations.\n\nTo win listings, exchanges present companies with arcane data on the quality of their markets, while also touting perks such as bell-ringings at the NYSE\u2019s historic trading floor or advertising on Nasdaq\u2019s electronic billboard overlooking Times Square.\n\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com", "description": "IEX Group will abandon its struggling listings effort after the upstart exchange\u2019s only listed company decided to jump ship.", "authors": ["Alexander Osipovich", "Alexander.Osipovich Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109732/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
