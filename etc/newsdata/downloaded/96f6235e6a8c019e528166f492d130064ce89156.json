He asked the SNCF to \"examine all options to take this case forward, including judiciary options\".\n\nThe French secretary of state for transport, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, added that the SNCF could take individual sanctions against the agents that have taken part in the strike.\n\nThe SNCF's CEO, Guillaume Pepy, has said the movement was a \"surprise strike\" and was \"not acceptable\".\n\nUnions angrily replied that there is \"anger about security\" in the rail workers' ranks and that SNCF agents have been warning about the \"lone driver\" policy since it was introduced a decade ago.\n\n\"If you do away with security, you will find yourself with a generalised conflict\", the CGT union said, accusing the prime minister of acting to \"degrade the movement through provocations\".\n\nWhile some unions, like the CGT, are calling for SNCF workers to \"heavily\" take part in a planned December 5 strike against President Macron's reform of the pensions system, others have disagreed.\n\nUnsa rail said: \"This isn't about merging struggles, let's not mix everything up.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the French rail traffic remained disrupted on its third day but the SNCF noted a \"progressive recovery\", adding that the network should be running normally by the end of the day.", "description": "The French rail network came close to a standstill on Friday and continued to be disrupted over the weekend in what the government described as a \"surprise strike\".", "authors": ["Pauline Bock"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/52/42/1000x563_cmsv2_692bb8ba-7df3-5d18-abee-c9a4f57a2673-4245242.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
