I think it further undermines and erodes any credibility Christine Ford ever had.\"\n\nBoothe continued, adding she believed Blasey Ford proved less than truthful during the Kavanaugh hearings.\n\n\"By the time the Washington Post ever went to print with her original story, she had already given multiple versions of the event. She lied about her fear of flying,\" she claimed.\n\nKatz made the remarks at the University of Baltimore\u2019s 11th Feminist Legal Theory Conference, titled \"Applied Feminism and #MeToo.\" Her comments were first quoted in the book \"Search and Destroy: Inside the Campaign Against Brett Kavanaugh\" by Ryan Lovelace, which Fox News has obtained.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine\u2019s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court,\u201d Katz said in the video. \u201cHe will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important.\n\n\"It is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine.\u201d\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "Christine Blasey Ford's attorney Debra Katz undermined her client's credibility when she discussed accusations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, according to Lisa Boothe.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/Brett-Kavanaugh.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
