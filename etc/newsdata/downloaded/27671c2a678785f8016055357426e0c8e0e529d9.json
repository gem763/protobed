Wales face Uruguay in Kumamoto, which is out of the path of the storm.\n\nBut the match everyone is interested in is hosts Japan against Scotland, scheduled to be played in Yokohama near Tokyo at 7:45 p.m.\n\nIf current forecasts are correct, Hagibis will be well into the sea east of Japan by then but organizers will need to assess any potential damage to the venue and also judge transport disruption.\n\nThe match is crucial as Japan aim to make it into their first World Cup quarterfinal, which they will guarantee if they avoid defeat to the Scots.\n\nIf the match is cancelled, it will be classed as a 0-0 draw and both teams will get two points, sending Scotland home.\n\nEven the possibility of a cancellation has sparked a row. Scotland threatened legal action if they were eliminated without playing the key match, prompting a stern response from World Rugby which stressed safety was paramount.\n\nHagibis has also disrupted the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka, where Saturday's qualifying session has been moved to race day on Sunday.\n\nThe typhoon is forecast to crash into central and eastern Japan early Saturday evening, packing maximum gusts of 216 kilometers hour, Japan's Meteorological Agency said.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Rugby World Cup officials said Saturday they would inspect venues for Sunday's matches immediately after Typhoon Hagibis has passed before deciding whether they can go ahead, as the crunch Japan-Scotland game in Yokohama hangs in the balance.
