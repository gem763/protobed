Photo: Dia Dipasupil/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nNo one can resist the lure of a fresh set of 2019 bangs. Not even one Harry Styles, previous owner of some very good heartthrob hair.\n\nLike almost everyone else, Styles was spotted out and about in Italy over the long weekend. Unlike almost everyone else, he was spotted out and about with a brand-new bowl cut, also known as Bangs for Men\u2122, covering his once very visible forehead (see left).\n\nThe new haircut was photographed in selfie form by a dad who recognized Styles despite his new, choppier do, and I am eternally grateful to Erin\u2019s father for such commitment and attention to detail.\n\nWhile I\u2019m always thrilled to welcome new sets of bangs into the world, certain corners of the internet are less than pleased with Styles\u2019s new style, which has been described as some \u201cjonathon byers looking ass type hair cut.\u201d Some fair-weather fans are even taking this opportunity to \u201cunstan,\u201d which sounds extreme and like a word we should never use again.\n\nLet us not forget that fellow heartthrob hair owner Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet rocks a bowl cut in his new Netflix film and he continues to thrive nevertheless. Plus, Styles\u2019s textured bangs have a decidedly Jaime Lannister vibe, and though that bowl cut died along with its owner (RIP), it will fondly be remembered as totally kind of hot by some.\n\nA couple of months ago, I\u2019d say give it time, but bowl cuts are officially happening. Please embrace them and their brethren with open arms.", "description": "Harry Styles was spotted in Italy with a brand-new set of bangs, confirming that we are officially entering the era of the bowl cut.", "authors": ["Erica Smith"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/03/3-harry-styles-2.w1200.h630.jpg"}
