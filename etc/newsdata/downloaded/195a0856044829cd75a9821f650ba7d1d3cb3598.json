The bike costs nearly as much as a Tesla Model 3, and aims for a market that does not really exist: young, \"green\" and affluent first-time motorcyclists.\n\nThe sleek sport bike has been available for preorder in the United States since January. However, the bulk of the orders are coming in from existing and old riders, according to interviews with 40 of the 150 dealerships nationwide that are carrying the bike this year.\n\nThe dealers Reuters spoke with account for little over a quarter of LiveWire dealerships and are spread across Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, California, Nevada, New Jersey and New York.\n\nHarley has for years failed to increase sales in the United States, its top market accounting for more than half of its motorcycles sold. As its tattooed, baby-boomer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company is finding it challenging to woo new customers.\n\nIn 2018, Harley posted the steepest sales decline in four years in the United States. U.S. sales are tipped to fall again this year.\n\n(Graphic on Harley's U.S. Retail sales: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/HARLEY%20DAVIDSON-ELECTRICBIKE/0H001QXBS8SB/index.html)\n\nThe heavyweight motorcycle maker's stock price has declined by 42% in the past five years. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index <.SPX> has gained 47%.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRICE BARRIER\n\nWhen Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich announced LiveWire's launch last year, his hope was the ease of riding motorcycles with no gears or clutch would help attract young and environmentally conscious urban riders.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters in February 2018, Levatich said the bike would help address Harley's demographic problem.\n\n\"It is more about the next century than the last century,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe preorders, thus far, have belied those hopes, according to the dealers.\n\n\"It is appealing to a demographic that is already riding,\" said Gennaro Sepe, a sales manager at a Harley dealership in Chicago. His store has received four preorders for the bike. All of them are from existing riders.\n\nHarley declined to comment on LiveWire preorders.\n\nThe motorcycle maker is not the only company investing in battery-powered transportation.\n\nTougher emissions rules in Europe, China and the United States are forcing auto companies to switch to electrified models. A survey of U.S. millennial motorcyclists, published in February by the Motorcycle Industry Council, found 69% of the riders interested in electric motorcycles.\n\nHarley's dealers said they are getting inquiries from young customers, but are struggling to translate them into sales. A key reason: LiveWire's retail price.\n\n\"Interest is very high,\" said a sales manager at a New Jersey-based dealership, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media. \"But once you get to pricing, interest is thrown out of the window.\"\n\nOver half of young college graduates in America, whom Harley is courting with battery-powered bikes, are saddled with student loans that entail average repayment of $200 to $300 per month.\n\nHarley is not offering any discount or incentives to push the sales, either, the dealers said.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC television in May, Levatich called LiveWire \"one of the best engineered products on the market\" and said it was worth its price.\n\nGary Jon Prough, general sales manager at a dealership in Countryside, Illinois, said the vast majority of millennials cannot afford the bike as LiveWire is targeted at young and affluent customers with incomes above $100,000 a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTESLA'S WAY\n\nTo drive up sales, Prough and other dealers expect Harley to go Tesla Inc's <TSLA.O> way: launch more affordable battery-powered vehicles after creating a buzz with the premium model.\n\nTesla's first electric car cost over $100,000, but prices came down with subsequent models. Its Model 3 now comes with a base price of $35,000 and was instrumental in lifting its vehicle deliveries to a record level in the latest quarter.", "description": "Harley-Davidson Inc  is betting on electric motorcycles to attract the next generation of younger and more environmentally conscious riders to reverse declining U.S. sales.
