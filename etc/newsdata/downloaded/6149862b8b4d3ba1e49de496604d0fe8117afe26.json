No reason for the direction was cited, he said.\n\nLuskin says Sondland 'is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify.'\n\nCenter of storm: Gordon Sondland was a Seattle-based hotelier until Donald Trump nominated him to his position as ambassador in May. Now the White House has blocked him from being deposed by the impeachment probe\n\nDemand for investigation: Gordon Sondland was involved in a text exchange which Democrats say is evidence of a quid pro quo for aid to Ukraine: that it would investigate Trump's 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the younger Biden's Ukrainian business dealings\n\nSondland was a Seattle-based hotelier until Trump nominated him to his position as ambassador in May. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in June and presented his credentials at the European Commission in July.\n\nAccording to text messages released by House committee leaders last week, Sondland was heavily involved in contacts with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as he sought a meeting with Trump, and Ukrainian officials expressed concern at the administration's decision to block nearly $400 million in U.S. military assistance for Kiev.\n\nIn one of the texts, for example, Sondland emphasized that Trump 'really wants the deliverable.'\n\nCharges that Trump pressured Zelensky in a July 25 telephone call to investigate Biden, a leading rival in Trump's 2020 re-election bid, while withholding the military aid, helped prompt House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment investigation last month.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nConcerns about the call, and possible Trump threats to Ukraine, came to the attention of Congress in a report by a whistleblower. On Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come forward to substantiate that complaint.\n\nSondland's scheduled appearance had marked a shift for the investigation because he is a Trump donor and political appointee.\n\nPrevious witnesses have been career officials, including the former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, and Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the U.S. Intelligence Community.\n\nVolker had resigned before he testified and the administration cannot direct Atkinson not to testify.\n\nTestimony: Former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker quit, revealing a trail of damaging texts with other officials including Gordon Sondland, and testified last week. Marie Yovanovitch, the career diplomat Trump fired as ambassador to Ukraine in May is testified to give evidence Friday\n\nAnother career diplomat, Marie Yovanovitch, will meet with the committees behind closed doors on Friday. Yovanovitch was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until Trump recalled her in May before her term was up, after Trump supporters questioned her loyalty.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry has heightened bitter partisan divides in Congress, where Trump's fellow Republicans control the Senate and Democrats have a majority in the House.\n\nTrump has reacted furiously to the inquiry, using obscenities and insulting nicknames for Democratic lawmakers in posts on Twitter. Administration officials - and some Republican allies in Congress - have questioned whether they have any obligation to cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nThe White House was expected to tell Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week that it would ignore lawmakers' demands for documents until the House holds a vote to approve the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi says a vote is not needed, although Democrats say the House would back the inquiry if there were a vote.\n\nVolker was interviewed on Thursday for more than eight hours by House members and staff.\n\nThe impeachment investigation could lead to the approval by the House of formal charges against Trump.\n\nA trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate, where Trump continues to enjoy nearly unwavering support from members of his party.", "description": "Gordon Sondland, a hotel magnate and Trump donor turned ambassador to the European Union will not be deposed Tuesday by the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, at the direction of the White House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/13/19442212-0-image-a-2_1570538336267.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
