Hers isn\u2019t a sob story, I know. But it\u2019s a dispiriting confirmation of the bragging rights and brand obsession that pervert higher education today.\n\nAlong with Shannen\u2019s distress, it may also help explain why more and more college students report and seek help for mental health issues. According to the American College Health Association, the percentage of students who profess a degree of anxiety that affects their studies has risen to 27.8 from 18.5 a decade earlier. The percentage who say that about depression has risen to 20.2 from 11.6.\n\nIn rural North Carolina, Tough meets and interviews Kim, whose working-class family doesn\u2019t do much to encourage her ambition. She gets into Clemson all on her own. Then she can\u2019t go, not right away, because the math of paying for it just doesn\u2019t work. Her optimism collides with \u2014 and is put seriously to the test by \u2014 the punishingly high cost of college in a country where, according to the Federal Reserve, there are more than 44 million borrowers who owe $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.\n\nKiKi nets the scholarships and financial aid she needs for Princeton. But she finds herself in such a tiny minority of poor students there that she feels culturally adrift. She\u2019s routinely reminded of and stressed by the social and economic divisions between her and other students. Tough\u2019s reporting makes clear how painfully common this experience is, because despite the most elite schools\u2019 pledges and boasts about diversifying their campuses, they\u2019re still theaters of extraordinary affluence, with screening practices that keep them that way.\n\nAll in all the landscape of higher education in America is forbidding to students of limited means. Many of them enter college academically behind their wealthier peers, who got better K-through-12 educations, and schools do too little to help them catch up. Many are lured to for-profit institutions that rake in money while failing to deliver on their promises.\n\nAnd that has dire consequences not just individually but also nationally. To spur innovation, compete globally and nurture prosperity in a country where factory jobs have ceased to be the answer, we need more, better college graduates. So why aren\u2019t we doing more to create them?\n\nNear the end of his book, Tough recalls the high school movement of the early 20th century, when industrialization called for a more skilled work force and America responded by making sure more of its citizens finished high school. Only 9 percent of them did in 1910. By 1940, that figure was up to 50 percent.", "description": "We need more and better graduates.
