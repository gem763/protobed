We\u2019ve no idea, but we\u2019re not going to knock it. If stirring tiny pots and pans filled with a questionable combination of toy food buys us enough time to knock together yet another dinner of pesto pasta, we are all for it.\n\nBefore you buy a toy kitchen, think about whether or not you need something compact and bijou that you won\u2019t spend all day tripping over.\n\nIf not, go for a mega toy kitchen with American-style fridge and all the extra accessories. It\u2019s just like buying a real kitchen, actually \u2013 if you can afford the extras, splash out. You\u2019ll never regret it.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a tip: refresh your accessories every now and then to keep kitchen play compelling.\n\nA new batch of play food is worth keeping in a cupboard to replace all the pieces that vanish into thin air. Or invest in some shiny new pans to breathe new life into your toy kitchen.\n\nA range of children aged from three to five years old tested these play kitchens over a period of several weeks.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Or that they use non-toxic paints and glues that don\u2019t affect the eco system? Neither did we until now, but that makes us love this stylish, modern toy kitchen even more. Our five-year-old tester and her friend can play with this for hours at a time \u2013 it\u2019s currently a pop-up pizza restaurant, I\u2019m told \u2013 and they show no sign of losing interest in it any time soon.\n\nBuy now\n\nPeppa Pig house kitchen: \u00a360, Argos\n\nIf you\u2019re three years old, this is the toy kitchen of your dreams. It\u2019s exactly like Peppa\u2019s kitchen from the TV series, complete with fully accessible fridge, recycling bins and a toaster with magical pop-up toast. It even plays electronic cooking sounds and the Peppa Pig theme tune. If you put the batteries in. (Just saying.)\n\nBuy now\n\nGeorge at Asda wooden deluxe kitchen: \u00a345, George at Asda\n\nEasy to assemble but robust enough to withstand plenty of banging of pots and pans, this stylish wooden kitchen has four burners, a toy microwave and a food cupboard. We think it\u2019s amazing value for money. Oh, and we love that it\u2019s blue and grey. Rather than, you know, pink.\n\nBuy now\n\nLittle Tikes cook \u2018n learn kitchen: \u00a3149.99, Little Tikes\n\nIf your house isn\u2019t a screen-free play zone, this will bring lots of interactive fun to playtime. Thanks to some kind of clever Bluetooth gadgetry, you can pop a tablet in the holder and interact with a host of related games, recipes and music via the free Cook \u2019n Learn app. Best of all, this plays lots of clever sound effects \u2013 and the light even comes on when you open the over door!\n\nBuy now\n\nMy 1st Years personalised grey play kitchen: \u00a3100, My 1st Years\n\nThis is a real keepsake toy to pass on to future generations. It\u2019s stylishly designed and comes with some beautiful utensils. Our five-year-old tester just loves that this one has her name on. And her mum loves the thought of her grandchildren playing with it one day. Or maybe she\u2019s got something in her eye.\n\nBuy now\n\nJaven children wooden play kitchen set: \u00a3109.99, Wayfair\n\nYou don\u2019t get much pinker than this, but that\u2019s exactly how some domestic-goddesses-in-training like their toy kitchens. We think this is better suited to younger kids, as it\u2019s a little small compared to some of the others we tested, but on the plus side it means you won\u2019t be constantly tripping over it. Cute, colourful and compact.\n\nBuy now\n\nGeorge at Asda home food truck: \u00a375, George at Asda\n\nGuaranteed to bring back memories of the glorious kebab trucks of your student halls of residence days (not just me, surely\u2026), this is a whole lot of fun. It\u2019s a fun and funky twist on the traditional toy kitchen but we found it kept our testers enthralled, and really helped take the imaginative play up a notch or two.\n\nBuy now\n\nFleur play kitchen: \u00a399, JoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9\n\nThis farmhouse-style kitchen has definite Instagram-appeal \u2013 it looks so beautiful. But there\u2019s also plenty here to keep little chefs occupied \u2013 we love the little drawers \u2013 so it\u2019s definitely not a case of style over substance. Our only complaint is that our tester\u2019s mum feels it puts her kitchen to shame, and now she\u2019d quite like a redesign to match this.\n\nBuy now\n\nJabadabado kitchen: \u00a390, Kidly\n\nSturdy yet stylish, this compact play kitchen is well-made, fairly easy to assemble, and ideal if you\u2019re short on space. We love the Scandi-chic design and the fact that it\u2019s gender-neutral.\n\nBuy now\n\nLe Toy Van oven and hob blue: \u00a369.95, Le Toy Van\n\nIf you\u2019re short on play space but have a budding baker on your hands, this is the perfect first play kitchen. It\u2019s very compact, so best suited to younger bakers, or ideal if you\u2019ve got space to play with it on a table top. And it\u2019s blue \u2013 hurrah!\n\nBuy now\n\nPat-a-Cake kitchen: \u00a3100, Great Little Trading Company\n\nIn our experience, wooden toys by GLTC are always stylish, sturdy and well-made, but what we particularly like about their latest play kitchen is the fact that there are plenty of extra features to keep little cooks occupied \u2013 we love the chalkboard on this \u2013 perfect for writing the day\u2019s shopping list or cafe specials!\n\nBuy now\n\nLeapFrog grill and learn BBQ: \u00a344.99, Smyths Toys Superstores\n\nYes, yes, we know it\u2019s a toy barbecue. But some kids just don\u2019t find a play kitchen all that appealing and for them, we can\u2019t recommend this highly enough as an interactive alternative. You get eight different play food items included and when you pop them on the interactive skewer, the grill recognises the food\u2019s name and colour. From counting to ten, to sizzling sound effects plus melodies and funny phrases, this has endless entertainment value. And at bedtime, you can stash all the accessories inside for storage \u2013 it\u2019s the eases barbecue clean-up ever!\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Play kitchens\n\nOur five-year-old tester gave the Hape cook n serve kitchen the double thumbs up. She loves that it has wheels so you can move it around easily, and we really like the extendable section which means you can open it up when friends come over to play or pack it away for neat storage when it\u2019s not in use.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
