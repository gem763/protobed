Voting booths close at 9 p.m., when the first exit polls will give an indication of the results.\n\nThe election comes after a four-year term in which Law and Justice have been accused of trampling over Poland\u2019s constitution, interfering in the judiciary and stifling the press. In a his campaign Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the 70-year-old Law and Justice leader, has repeatedly stressed the importance of the traditional family unit and the danger of LGBT people.\n\nThe party has been helped by a period of strong economic growth in Poland and low unemployment. A generous social welfare system they introduced following the 2015 election that pays out around $130 in benefits for each child has also won them support beyond their normal base. The party has increased pensions and abolished taxes for those under 26.\n\n[How do Poland\u2019s ruling populists remain so popular? Follow the money.]\n\nLike President Trump\u2019s presidency in the United States, the party\u2019s tenure has deeply divided Poland, cleaving families and polarizing political debate.\n\nAt a polling station in central Warsaw, 64-year-old Bogumila Pawelek was voting for Law and Justice. \u201cThey take care of families,\u201d she said, in reference to the extra cash Poles receive.\n\n\u201cThey bought the family,\u201d muttered her husband, who had cast his ballot for the Civic Coalition, a center right party that is the main opposition. \u201cThe rest of our family understand that this party is breaking any and all standards going up to and beyond the limits of the law,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he was happy to provide for his wife rather than relying on the state to provide their pensions. \u201cI will have to do it until the end of our days, I knew what I got when I married her.\u201d\n\n\n\nA view of a polling station during the parliamentary elections in Nienadowa, in southeastern Poland, Oct. 13, 2019.

Their generous social welfare policy also came at a time when people were \u201ctired\u201d after painful decades of transition since the fall of communism, he said.\n\nThe party has been hugely popular and argues that the opposition would take these new benefits away. After initially criticizing Law and Justice for draining the budget and diverting money from much needed investment in Poland\u2019s health and education systems, the opposition Civic Coalition has now promised not to remove any benefits.\n\nThe Civic Coalition is polling at around 22 percent after what Kuisz described as four years of \u201cpolitical blunders\u201d\n\n\n\nCivic Coalition's candidate for prime minister, Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska and her husband Jan Kidawa-Blonski at a polling station during the parliamentary elections in Warsaw, Oct. 13, 2019.

In elections four years ago, Law and Justice won a majority of seats with just 38 percent of the vote after smaller parties failed to meet the minimum threshold gain any seats, meaning those votes were wasted.\n\nThe left wing coalition, Lewica, is expected to become the third largest party in parliament this time around with around 13 percent of the vote after an unexpected gain in the polls.\n\n\u201cThe very violent discourse against LGBT, over who is a true Pole or not, it will eventually play well for the left,\u201d said Kuisz. \u201cThey are the clear opposition, but it may take time.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nPoland\u2019s plan to get rid of independent judges has just hit a roadblock\n\nPolish towns advocate \u2018LGBT-free\u2019 zones while the ruling party cheers them on\n\nHow some Polish far-right nationalists went from setting their hopes on Trump to rallying against him\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "A campaign vilifying Poland\u2019s LGBT community and generous social welfare has resonated.", "authors": ["Loveday Morris", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8TbglTsK6vUK1o9-GcRyX6Qr26I=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/62WWXUHNV4I6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
