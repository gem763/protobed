He visited some of the world\u2019s top destinations \u2014 Abu Dhabi; Sydney, Australia; and Singapore \u2014 and only flew in first or business class. He stayed in multi-room suites at top-tier hotels.\n\nWhenever possible, he opened more than one card on the same day because credit agencies compile multiple credit inquiries into a single pull, reducing the impact to his credit score.\n\nThe whole experience would have cost him over $36,000. But thanks to credit-card rewards and hotel loyalty programs, he only spent around $5,000.\n\nAt the time, Haverty worked in corporate banking, and his employer began requiring employees to take a full two weeks of vacation. He saw the requirement as an opportunity to take an incredible trip. Around that same time, Haverty heard about the apartment-like first-class accommodations on Etihad Airways\u2019 flights between Abu Dhabi and Sydney.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re someone who\u2019s independently wealthy, when would you have the chance to fly first class in what was essentially a small apartment from the Middle East to Australia?\u201d said Haverty, who now runs the website Financial Analyst Insider. So he set about creating a vacation \u2014 centered on that one flight \u2014 that would cost him as little as possible.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The $3 billion mistake Americans are making with their credit cards\n\nHere\u2019s how he did it:\n\nOptimizing credit-card rewards\n\nWhen Haverty set out to make this trip possible, he only had two credit cards. Over the course of a year, he would open seven more. He based his approach on the expertise he developed through his line of work.\n\n\u201cI managed it like a portfolio,\u201d Haverty said. \u201cWhat I discovered is you could open credit cards and increase your credit score in the process if you were disciplined about it.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Lou Haverty Lou Haverty, a 39-year-old financial analyst, is pictured in the Abu Dhabi first-class lounge for Etihad Airways.\n\nFor starters, he created a spreadsheet to keep track of the cards he opened, the bonuses they offered, and the annual fees they charged. He also used the spreadsheet to remember how many credit cards he had opened from various banks, since some companies have rules limiting the number of cards a consumer can open.\n\nHaverty timed things out so he would apply for new cards when there were large sign-up bonuses available. Whenever possible, he applied and opened more than one card on the same day; he found that credit agencies compiled the multiple credit inquiries into a single pull, reducing the impact to his credit score.\n\nRead more: This woman paid off $10,000 in credit-card debt with a personal loan, but her first attempt landed her in the red again\n\nThis is a mock-up Lou Haverty created of the spreadsheet he used to track his credit-card rewards.\n\nHe focused his efforts on credit cards that had rewards programs with transferable points that could be used for a wide array of airlines. He also prioritized cards that offered better points-back rates, such as the Chase Ink card JPM, +0.59% (which offered 5X points at office-supply stores) and the American Express Blue Cash Everyday card AXP, -0.31% (which offered 5% back at grocery stores.)\n\nAfter six or seven months, he would apply for new cards once the balances on the previous batch had been paid off.\n\nBefore closing a card, he inquired about transferring the card\u2019s credit limit to another card from the same bank. This way he avoided reducing the amount of credit available to him.\n\nIn many cases, the credit cards waived the annual fee for the first year. When time came for the annual fee to kick in, Haverty evaluated whether a card was worth keeping. If it wasn\u2019t, he closed it to prevent overspending.\n\nBefore closing a card, Haverty inquired about transferring the card\u2019s credit limit to another card from the same bank. This way he avoided reducing the amount of credit available to him. Otherwise, closing these cards would worsen his credit utilization ratio \u2014 the measure of how much of their available credit a consumer has used \u2014 which is an integral part of a person\u2019s credit score.\n\nOverall, the credit-card strategy Haverty employed boosted his credit score by roughly 100 points over the course of a year.\n\n\u2018What I discovered is you could open credit cards and increase your credit score in the process if you were disciplined about it.\u2019 \u2014Lou Haverty, a 39-year-old financial analyst\n\nHe developed two strategies to spend money quickly without putting a major dent in his bank account. The first involved using the credit cards to buy gift cards at grocery stores. \u201cYou can meet the purchase requirements on the credit cards, but give yourself extra time to spend the money as part of your regular everyday shopping rather than being forced to spend it too fast,\u201d he said.\n\nHe especially did this when grocery stores ran promotions to get free gas for shopping.\n\nHe also bought electronics when they were on sale at stores like BJ\u2019s Wholesale BJ, -1.32% and Costco COST, -0.61% and then resell them, either at-cost or at a slight discount on sites like Amazon. \u201cIt prevents you from buying the things you don\u2019t need,\u201d Haverty said.\n\nAlso see: This mother took her family on a $2,200 vacation to Disney World \u2014 for free\n\nMaking business travel pay off\n\nHe stayed in Hyatt hotels H, +0.06% as often as possible when traveling in the lead-up to his dream vacation. As a result, he earned Diamond status with Hyatt, which entitled him to a few free upgrades to suites during his vacation.\n\nOtherwise, he used the Hyatt points he earned to help offset the cost of the hotels. There was another bonus to staying at Hyatt: He was entitled to free breakfast.\n\nThroughout the 14-night trip, he only spent two nights at a hotel owned by a company other than Hyatt \u2014 in this case, a Hilton property in Frankfurt, Germany, during the final leg of his adventure.\n\nGetty Images One of the hotels Haverty stayed at was the Hyatt Capital Gate Hotel in Abu Dhabi. Haverty worked up to Diamond status with Hyatt before his trip to build rewards to offset his lodging costs.\n\nThe tally and final verdict\n\nIn total, Haverty spent roughly $3,400 on his accommodations, $745 on the taxes and fees for his flights that points couldn\u2019t pay for and around $800 on dining and entertainment. All told, he estimates that he spent no more than $4,900 for this trip.\n\nOf course, those calculations don\u2019t take into account all the effort the endeavor required. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a part-time job, but you have to put in time to manage something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to treat it like a hobby.\u201d\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t call it a part time job, but you have to put in time to manage something like that.\u2019 \u2014Lou Haverty on the effort required to game credit-card rewards to pay for a trip like this\n\nNevertheless, the trip was more than worth it, he argued. He got to travel in the lap of luxury. Highlights included the culinary experiences in each of the cities he visited, riding in limos to and from the airport when he flew first class on Etihad and getting to spend time in some of the world\u2019s most opulent airport lounges.\n\nHaverty said it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to recreate the trip in large part because banks have cut back on their credit-card rewards. For instance, Haverty took advantage of the fourth-night-free benefit with the Citi Prestige card, which reduced the cost of his hotel stays. Starting next month though, Citi C, +0.70% will only allow Prestige card holders to use the benefit twice a year, rather than on an unlimited basis.\n\nStill, a person could cobble together a similar adventure if they tried hard enough. The key, Haverty said, is to ensure that racking up the rewards doesn\u2019t put them in debt.\n\nAfter all, what is ultimately the biggest downside to gaming rewards to earn a vacation like this? \u201cOnce you go back and have to fly economy, it makes it harder to do,\u201d Haverty said.", "description": "He traveled across the Middle East, Australia, Southeast Asia and Europe.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP568_singap_ZG_20190815151406.jpg"}
