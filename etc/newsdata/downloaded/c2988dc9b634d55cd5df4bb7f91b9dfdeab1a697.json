To pull it off, they\u2019re casting Democrats as extremists \u2014 invoking hot-button issues such as abortion and immigration that Republicans had largely avoided as they attempted to soften their connection to an unpopular President Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe strategy was to try to make it comfortable for women to vote Republican again,\u201d longtime Virginia political analyst Robert Holsworth said. The harsh turn \u201cmay be a risky strategy because it may remind people again of their Republican identity, which at the moment is not that popular in suburban Virginia.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, too, have resorted to tougher tactics as next week\u2019s election looms, depicting Republicans as chummy with Trump and in the pocket of the National Rifle Association. But that\u2019s consistent with the strategy they\u2019ve adopted all along, in a year when national Democrats view Virginia as a tuneup for next fall\u2019s presidential contest.\n\n\u201cThe road to 2020 runs through 2019,\u201d Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke said in a video the Democratic Party of Virginia tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cAnd the success for the United States of America is dependent on what we do this year in the commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith all 140 seats in the General Assembly on the ballot next week, control of the legislature is at stake. Republicans are defending slight majorities of 20-19 in the Senate and 51-48 in the House of Delegates, with one vacancy in each chamber.\n\nIf Democrats can win both, they\u2019ll consolidate power with Gov. Ralph Northam and be able to push through an ambitious agenda of gun control, abortion access, environmental protections, a higher minimum wage and passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. They\u2019ll also oversee redistricting in 2021 after the U.S. Census, setting the course for Virginia politics for the next decade.\n\nMany of the Democratic issues poll well with Virginians, particularly in the suburbs \u2014 which is why Republican candidates treated them carefully for much of the summer. A number of GOP incumbents have touted their support for Medicaid expansion even though they opposed it for years until a few joined with Democrats to pass it in 2018.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSen. Glen H. Sturtevant (R-Richmond), considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents because his district has become increasingly blue, initially focused on health care in a campaign that could have been mistaken for a Democrat\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHealth care shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue,\u201d he says in an ad launched in mid-September. \u201cMy mom suffered a near heart attack. Then her insurance surprised her with a bill they refused to pay. I\u2019m taking on the insurance companies to stop surprise billing.\u201d\n\nBut Sturtevant, who has spent nearly $1 million on TV ads, has recently lobbed sharp attacks at his Democratic challenger, Ghazala Hashmi. \u201cHashmi\u2019s radical politics are just like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\u201d one ad says, referring to the liberal first-term New York congresswoman.\n\nAD\n\nAnother ad pairs Hashmi\u2019s image with those of Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Democratic Socialist running for president. \u201cGhazala Hashmi wants to bring Washington\u2019s extreme socialist agenda to Virginia,\u201d it says.\n\nAD\n\nHashmi has spent $812,000 on ads, beginning with upbeat biographical spots but turning more recently to attacks on Sturtevant\u2019s record and \u201cslick image campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cSturtevant voted to deny health coverage to 400,000 Virginians,\u201d one ad says, referring to his opposition to expanding Medicaid. Another ad shows newspaper headlines on mass shootings, including one that reads, \u201cMassacre on campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ever wonder why this keeps happening, it\u2019s because Republican politicians like Glen Sturtevant block laws that would save lives,\u201d the ad says. Another ad highlights Sturtevant\u2019s A rating from the NRA. A YouTube spot calls his tactics \u201ca page right out of Donald Trump\u2019s playbook.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRepublican Sen. Siobhan S. Dunnavant (Henrico) is another incumbent in a rapidly shifting district who played down her party affiliation during much of the campaign. Early on, Dunnavant, an OB/GYN with an A rating from the NRA, released an ad that cast her as a doctor and mother concerned about gun violence.\n\nAD\n\nBut in the final weeks, Dunnavant is focused on abortion.\n\nEarlier this year, Del. Kathy Tran (D-Fairfax) presented a bill to a General Assembly subcommittee that would have loosened restrictions on late-term abortions. Tran\u2019s testimony that the bill would allow abortion up to the point of delivery \u2014 something Virginia law already allows in certain circumstances \u2014 drew national outrage from conservatives and figured to be a prominent talking point for Republican campaigns.\n\nAD\n\nAfter Alabama and several other states sought drastic abortion restrictions this summer, though, Virginia Republicans backed off the issue, fearing that voters would see it as a broader attack on abortion rights.\n\nDunnavant has cast that caution aside. Her recent ad uses video in which Dunnavant\u2019s opponent \u2014 Del. Debra H. Rodman of Henrico \u2014 is standing next to Tran during the controversial testimony.\n\nAD\n\nRodman\u2019s role as a co-sponsor of Tran\u2019s bill \u201ckind of makes it hard to resist,\u201d said a Republican strategist familiar with Dunnavant\u2019s campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. \u201cIndependents, when they see that video, they\u2019re turned off. . . . We thought it would be important to put in front of voters as part the closing message. And we think it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRodman\u2019s campaign has countered with mailers saying Dunnavant wants an \u201cextreme ban\u201d on abortion, based on recorded comments in which Dunnavant says she would like to ban abortion after 12 weeks unless the mother\u2019s life is at risk.\n\nRodman is also airing a TV ad that features another Henrico County OB/GYN accusing Dunnavant of undermining the Affordable Care Act with a bill that would have expanded low-cost, short-term plans that do not cover preexisting conditions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe truth is, Senator Dunnavant\u2019s 96% Republican party-line voting record to block Medicaid Expansion and gun safety legislation is completely out of line with what our community cares about,\u201d Rodman said in an email.\n\nAD\n\nIn Virginia Beach, Republican challenger Shannon Kane sent a mailer in which an image of Democratic Del. Kelly K. Convirs-Fowler had been photoshopped into a picture of MS-13 gang members, provoking cries of racism like those that greeted a similar tactic by GOP gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie in 2017.\n\nAlso in Virginia Beach, the husband of a victim of that city\u2019s May 31 mass shooting complained that his words were used without his permission in a mailer for incumbent Sen. William R. DeSteph Jr. (R). DeSteph said he had no control over the mailer, which \u2014 in an unusual move \u2014 was funded by the Republican Party of Virginia but not coordinated with the candidate.\n\nAD\n\nIn Richmond, Democrat VanValkenburg has faced relentless attacks as he defends the seat he flipped to blue from red two years ago. His own words are being thrown back at him: In 2016, before he held office, VanValkenburg defended U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D) against criticism from the left. Writing on Facebook that \u201cI identify as socialist in many ways,\u201d he slammed socialists for judging Kaine as not progressive enough.\n\nHis reelection opponent, Vandergriff, has taken the comments literally and depicted him in a Soviet-style poster, continually referring to him as a socialist. VanValkenburg, a high school government teacher, dismisses the attacks as \u201csuch a caricature of that kind of Trump style.\u201d\n\nBut they have drawn notice. Constituent Jim Schroering stopped his truck on Sunday afternoon when he saw VanValkenburg canvassing his neighborhood. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what I just got in the mail,\u201d Schroering, 61, said, then described one of Vandergriff\u2019s mailers.\n\n\u201cI was so disgusted by looking at it,\u201d Schroering said. He said that he had seen Vandergriff\u2019s campaign signs earlier and hadn\u2019t been able to figure out her party affiliation, but that the attack ads cleared up the mystery. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be a Republican,\u201d he said.\n\nVandergriff\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. But a spokesman for the State Government Leadership Foundation (SGLF) \u2014 a partner of the Republican State Leadership Committee, which focuses on winning state-level elections for Republicans \u2014 defended the tactic.", "description": "After a summer of cultivated centrism in districts that are getting bluer, Republican candidates\u2019 rhetoric is becoming harsher as they try to turn out GOP voters for an election that will determine control of the General Assembly and redistricting after the 2020 Census.", "authors": ["Gregory S.
