That could affect a host of different stocks in the energy space, according to Goldman Sachs strategists.\n\nIn a note to clients, Goldman says the companies with \u201cthe greatest 4Q19 potential operating cash flow percentage uplift\u201d from rising oil prices include names like Hess (HES), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Cimarex Energy (XEC) and Apache (APA), among others.\n\nAs for the companies with the highest potential \u201cfree cash flow yield uplift\u201d for the fourth quarter of 2019, Goldman points to Murphy Oil (MUR) as well as Apache and Cimarex.\n\nPrices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CL=F), the U.S. oil benchmark, surged roughly 10% Monday, crossing $60 a barrel. Though prices are still below the 2019 high of roughly $66 a barrel from late April. Plus, WTI fell over 2% last week \u2014Monday\u2019s gain is coming off of an already depleted basis.\n\nOil pump jacks work at sunset near Midland, Texas, U.S., August 21, 2019.

REUTERS/Jessica Lutz More\n\nBrent, the international oil benchmark, saw prices surge over 10% Monday to just shy of $67 a barrel.\n\nMilitary strikes hit key crude production facilities in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, curtailing Saudi Arabian oil production by some 5.7 million barrels per day.\n\n\u201cThe length of the disruption is unknown,\u201d Goldman analysts noted.\n\nThough some analysts feel the market wasn\u2019t correctly pricing in geopolitical tensions into oil prices\n\n\u201cNo matter whether it takes Saudi Arabia 5 days or a lot longer to get oil back into production, there is but one rational takeaway from this weekend\u2019s drone attacks on the Kingdom\u2019s infrastructure \u2013 that infrastructure is highly vulnerable to attack, and the market has been persistently mispricing oil, which Citi reckons should have been a good $10 a barrel higher than it has been for months,\u201d Citi analysts wrote to clients in a note.\n\nThe developments in Saudi Arabia prompted multiple tweets from President Trump on Sunday, including this one:\n\n\u201cBased on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.\u201d\n\nAMS More\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
