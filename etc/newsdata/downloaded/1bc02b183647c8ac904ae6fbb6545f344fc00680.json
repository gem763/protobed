(Getty)\n\nIs 2 Super Bowl rings enough?\n\nThe most-cited credential for Manning\u2019s case is the most obvious one. He won two Super Bowls. This fact is being treated by many as an automatic qualifier for the Hall of Fame, as if Manning upended the top seed in the MEAC to make the NCAA tournament.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nWhile an impressive feat, the accomplishment most definitely is not a ticket to Canton. Just ask Jim Plunkett.\n\nThere already exists a coveted award for winning two Super Bowls. It\u2019s called a pair of Super Bowl rings.\n\nWhat about beating Tom Brady?\n\nBut he beat the New England Patriots \u2014 twice! Surely stopping Tom Brady and the ever-loathed Patriots from collecting seven straight Super Bowl rings is reason enough to punch his ticket?\n\nStory continues\n\nNo. It\u2019s not. And he didn\u2019t beat the Patriots alone. The Giants anchored by a fierce pass rush and prudent game plan to pressure Brady beat the Patriots. The Giants scored 17 and 21 points in those wins.\n\nManning was excellent in New York\u2019s Super Bowls and playoff runs and made some of the biggest plays in the history of the game. But those victories defined team effort, not brilliant runs by a superior quarterback.\n\nOnce we get past those Super Bowls and who was on the losing end, the arguments devolve from flimsy to disingenuous.\n\nQuantity does not equal quality\n\nOne of the most repeated cases for Manning\u2019s Hall credential to surface Tuesday pointed to his longevity.\n\nFor 14 straight seasons, Manning started every game at quarterback for the Giants except for his brief, one-game absence in 2017 when Ben McAdoo saw the writing on the wall and benched the declining veteran.\n\nAgain \u2014 that\u2019s an impressive feat and something that should be celebrated, especially in Giants circles. But the Hall of Fame is about quality. Quantity only counts if the performance measures up. In Manning\u2019s case it doesn\u2019t.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie\n\nBarring more starts, Manning will finish his career as a .500 quarterback with a 116-116 record. Aside from the two Super Bowl runs, the Giants never won another playoff game during Manning\u2019s 15-season tenure as starter.\n\nCompare his record to his most likened contemporary, Ben Roethlisberger, who also has a pair of Super Bowl rings.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers are 144-77-1 behind Roethlisberger and were regular contenders and playoff participants when they weren\u2019t winning Super Bowls.\n\nPittsburgh was always in the mix. New York usually wasn\u2019t.\n\nThis is what a Hall of Famer looks like. (Getty)\n\nCompare him to actual deserving Hall of Famers\n\nLining Manning up to the rest of his contemporaries does him absolutely no favors.\n\nPeyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, Brady. Eli Manning. Something here does not belong.\n\nThe first four names are true all-time greats and no-brainer first-ballot Hall inductees. The junior Manning is a zero-time All-Pro and three-time NFL interception champion with a career quarterback rating (84.2) on par with Joe Flacco (84.1).\n\nIf Flacco had another ring, would we be having this same ridiculous discussion about him?\n\nEli\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 consists entirely of two games\n\nThe bottom line is that if you take two victories off Manning\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9, this discussion wouldn\u2019t exist. His overall body of work doesn\u2019t resemble that of a Hall of Famer. And a pair of wins, no matter how big, simply don\u2019t cut it.\n\nBut his name is Manning. He played a long time for one of the NFL\u2019s glamour franchises in the nation\u2019s biggest market. And his Giants twice defeated the greatest villain in NFL history.\n\nThese are all standalone accomplishments that are rightfully celebrated. But just because a story is a good one and an integral part of the NFL fabric, it doesn\u2019t make it Hall worthy.\n\nCanton shouldn\u2019t be cheapened for the sake of a good story. Based on the noise surrounding Manning\u2019s demotion, it sounds like it will be.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJason Owens is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
