The numerous projects in the regulatory pipeline could power nearly 10 million homes.\n\nBut the only offshore wind farm operating in the country, near Rhode Island and operated by \u00d8rsted, is tiny \u2014 just 5 turbines.\n\nProposals for far bigger farms, including this one off Atlantic City, are piling up as one project is delayed and the Trump administration conducts a broad review of the cumulative impact of all of them.\n\n\u00d8rsted\u2019s U.S.-based CEO, Thomas Brostr\u00f8m, said in an interview here that this review is a \u201cspeed bump\u201d \u2014 but he also acknowledged his company is making contingency plans if delays go on for too long.\n\n\u201cWe've seen maybe a speed bump, which creates a little bit of uncertainty but that's following 4 or 5 years of very, very positive development. And obviously this is way too big to fail. We're looking at $70 billion to be invested over the next 10 years.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Thomas Brostr\u00f8m, \u00d8rsted U.S. CEO, \"Axios on HBO\" interview\n\nWhere it stands: The Interior Department, which regulates energy on federal lands and in federally owned waters, aims to complete the broader analysis of the industry\u2019s impact, especially on commercial fisheries, early next year.\n\nIt\u2019s part of an extended review of one particular project planned for Massachusetts, called Vineyard Wind. The project is backed by Avangrid, Inc., a U.S.-based subsidiary of Spanish energy firm Iberdrola and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, a Danish investment firm.\n\nThe Interior Department hasn\u2019t publicized the scope of the broader review, including how many wind farms and other specifics. Department spokesman Stephen Boutwell said the additional review \u201cwill help ensure the future success of all ocean users.\u201d\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: Even Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), an ardent climate-change advocate, quietly signed onto a letter recently urging the Trump administration to conduct more comprehensive reviews.\n\nCritics say such reviews could slow projects down, but Whitehouse contends they would ultimately speed up the process.\n\nHe also criticized Vineyard Wind for setting \u201ca very bad example for the industry\u201d by, according to Whitehouse, making a deal without getting input from area fisheries.\n\n\u201cIf it was going to be the future of offshore wind to follow that example, they [the industry] were in for a long series of really difficult battles and long lawsuits and delays. So what we\u2019re trying to do is head that off so that [the Interior Department] has a good process with a lot of good work up front.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), \"Axios on HBO\" interview\n\nThe other side: Brendan Moss, Vineyard Wind spokesman, said the company was the first U.S.-based developer to hire a liaison to the fisheries in 2010 and continues to pursue that approach. \u201cThe insight of fishermen and fisheries research scientists is invaluable as we work to develop a strong and responsible American offshore wind industry,\u201d Moss said.\n\nThe intrigue: Clouding the bureaucratic fight over process is President Trump\u2019s uniquely strong hatred of wind, possibly stemming from a fight one of his golf courses in Scotland waged (unsuccessfully) against an offshore wind farm there.\n\nMore than any other type of energy, he regularly bashes wind in rallies, saying (inaccurately) that wind turbines cause cancer and that if it\u2019s not windy, you can\u2019t watch TV.\n\nYes, but: Trump\u2019s hatred hasn\u2019t (yet) led to any tangible impact on the actual approval of wind farms, say executives, politicians and others following the process closely.\n\nTrump\u2019s first secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, was vocally supportive of offshore wind, praising it at wind conferences and writing op-eds. The current leader, David Bernhardt, has not publicly commented on offshore wind, but it\u2019s unclear whether that means he\u2019s putting roadblocks up.\n\n\u201cI do think that a little more time will tell whether Secretary Bernhardt\u2019s intentions are honorable or not with respect to offshore wind,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pick out right now out of the noise what is simple incompetence and what is a general desire to impede offshore wind.\u201d", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
