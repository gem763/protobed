USA TODAY\n\nAnother week, another questionable officiating decision in the NFL.\n\nIn the Houston Texans' 30-23 loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, referee Tony Corrente\u2019s officiating crew blew a second-quarter play dead that wiped out a touchdown from Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson to receiver DeAndre Hopkins. Because it was a third down, the play blown dead forced Texans coach Bill O\u2019Brien to bring out the field goal unit on fourth down.\n\nDuring the play, a third-and-goal from the 4-yard line, Watson faced a pass rush from Colts defenders Jabaal Sheard and Justin Houston but remained in the pocket and tried to extend the play. Eventually, Houston had Watson wrapped up around the ankles, causing a member from the officiating crew to blow the whistle and blow the play dead.\n\nWatson, though, attempted a pass just after the whistle blew and found Hopkins near the goal line. Hopkins caught the pass and dipped into the end zone for what would have been a score. That would have potentially put the score at 10-7, assuming the extra point try had been converted, for the Texans. Instead, the Texans cut the Colts' lead to 7-6.\n\nTexans robbed of four points and a spectacular highlight by Tony Corrente. pic.twitter.com/sbPuFodRy1 \u2014 Rivers McCown (@riversmccown) October 20, 2019\n\nAfter the play, Watson immediately ran over to Corrente to try to make his plea to reverse the call and let the touchdown stand.\n\nIt officially went down as a 9-yard sack.\n\n\u201cI went back and forth with the ref. He said I was down,\u201d Watson at a postgame news conference. \u201cIf you watch the tape of all the plays I stand and make in the red zone ... He said he was trying to protect my health. It goes back and forth, but that\u2019s the call he made. We have to live with it.\u201d\n\nAfter the blown whistle, the Colts marched down the field to score a touchdown and take a 14-6 lead.\n\n\u201cIt is a player like Deshaun Watson that can extend a play,\u201d CBS officiating analyst and former NFL referee Gene Steratore said during the broadcast. \u201cThe trouble you get into as a referee, is that when he gets held up there, now he\u2019s suspect to taking a big hit, and if the emphasis is to try to protect the quarterback, then sometimes you will have plays where it goes like that. \u2026 It\u2019s a decision Tony Corrente makes, and I can\u2019t disagree with that.\u201d\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
