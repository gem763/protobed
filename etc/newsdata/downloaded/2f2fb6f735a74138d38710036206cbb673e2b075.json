Looking like a tourist or not speaking fluent Spanish or Basque resulted in some type of price discrimination.\n\nThis is bad news for a city whose plan for tourism depends heavily on the popularity of the pintxo.\n\nTourism to San Sebasti\u00e1n has grown exponentially over the last few years Credit: samael334 More\n\n\u201cOne thing is the debate on whether the prices are too high, and another thing is this,\u201d said Denis Itxaso, Deputy of Culture, Cooperation, Youth and Sports on the Provincial Council of Gipuzkoa, via Twitter. \u201cIf I go on holiday and find out they are charging me more than the locals, even if they do so with a smile or serve really great food, I\u2019m not going back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reaction in general has been positive and along the lines of what we wanted to achieve with the piece,\u201d said Vallejo. \u201cIn a city where the culinary culture is so important, there should be a coherence between both the culinary values and the cultural and social values that are transmitted.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, the reaction of the donostiarras, as residents of San Sebasti\u00e1n are known, has been a quiet uproar among both those in the industry and the patrons of the town\u2019s bars.\n\nAre restaurants and bars justified in charging tourists more than locals? Credit: GETTY More\n\nJosema Azpeitia, editor of the popular culinary medium Ondojan.com, sees a larger problem underlying these small price adjustments. \u201cI think it\u2019s really bad, and that the Town Hall should impose strict fines. There are bars that have always done this. The problem now with the growth of restaurant investment groups, charging more to certain people is not done spontaneously \u2013 they have institutionalized the practice in their very cash registers.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "The pintxo bars in the Old Town of San Sebasti\u00e1n have been caught overcharging foreigners in an undercover expos\u00e9 by a local newspaper.", "authors": ["Marti Buckley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1s1d4jPEIQR8_2x_M229OQ--~B/aD02MjU7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/b6c2870d809d7c97fc0010a6c37cbca1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
