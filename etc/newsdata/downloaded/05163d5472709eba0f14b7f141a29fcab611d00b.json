All of it was, in fact, a great compliment to Warren. During both the opening stretch of the debate and subsequent ones, her prescriptions were the point of reference, her priorities set the terms of the discussion, and she was the candidate to whom the debate\u2019s moderators kept returning so that she could respond to her rivals\u2019 invocations of her.\n\n\u00a9 Damon Winter/The New York Times The teleprompter at the Fox News booth in the spin room at Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate.\n\nAnd she stayed cool and confident under fire, sounding more grateful for the spotlight than fearful of the microscope. It was, for the most part, a fine performance.\n\nBut it was also, at first, an exasperating one. That unwillingness to talk candidly about middle-class taxes, though she was pressed by both a moderator and by other candidates to do so, bordered on perverse.\n\nShe kept saying, as if it were a tic or a stutter, that \u201ccosts will go down\u201d for middle-class families, the translation of which is that taxes might well go up but that those families would be economically ahead of the game in the end.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, why not be explicit about the arithmetic and own it? If there\u2019s nothing to hide from, why hide from it? Warren has campaigned as a truth teller but came across, in this instance, as a classically evasive Washington operator, scared to treat voters as grown-ups who can process information in a sophisticated manner.\n\n[Get a more personal take on politics, newsmakers and more with Frank Bruni\u2019s exclusive commentary every week.

O.K., maybe \u201cloved\u201d is too strong a word, but I appreciated it, for three main reasons.\n\nOne is that Warren\u2019s rivals jousted with her more than before \u2014 on health care, on her \u201cwealth tax,\u201d on the way she speaks about corporations and the richest Americans. That was crucial, because it brought to the surface questions about her ideas that are best recognized and evaluated now, so that Democratic voters can figure out if she\u2019s their surest bet against President Trump. It was also important because it gave her a better chance than the previous, gentler debates did to show what she\u2019s made of.\n\nAnd once she got past that maddeningly vague start, she was fierce.\n\nShe also displayed flashes of charm, most memorably after Joe Biden patronized her, taking some of the credit for the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that she more than anyone made happen. He volunteered that he, as vice president, was responsible for building the necessary support in Congress.\n\n\u201cI got you votes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am deeply grateful,\u201d she responded, \u201cto President Obama.\u201d It was a dexterous and devastating way of observing how readily Biden claims the accomplishments of an administration in which he played second fiddle.\n\nShe had another deft moment regarding the subject of whether voters should be concerned that she, Sanders and Biden are all 70 or older.\n\n\u201cI will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone,\u201d she said, \u201cand that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.\u201d\n\nThe second reason I appreciated this debate was that it vividly framed the fundamental tension in the Democratic field, the fault line separating Warren and Sanders, for example, from Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar, among others.\n\nThe latter group of candidates traffic in measured remedies that are more obviously attainable, prioritizing imperfect, incremental change over grandly transformative proposals that face hurdles galore and very long odds. In their estimation \u2014 in mine, too \u2014 that\u2019s probably the safer agenda with which to do battle against Trump, whose ouster eclipses all other goals. It\u2019s also the best hope for national healing.\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said, specifically explaining why he wasn\u2019t signing on to Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s push for the confiscation of assault weapons but also articulating a general philosophy beyond that. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d\n\nWarren flatly rejected the idea that, in her words, \u201csome vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems\u201d is a winning formula for Democrats. \u201cIf all Democrats can promise is that after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose,\u201d she said.\n\nThere was a similar \u2014 and similarly important \u2014 back-and-forth about the Manichaean, truculent language that she uses to talk about Americans on different sides of the economic divide.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. Klobuchar chimed in: \u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d\n\nShe was referring to Tom Steyer, who was making his Democratic-debate debut.\n\nWarren said that she had nothing against billionaires per se and wasn\u2019t in the demonization business. She was in the justice business. And with her final remarks, she sought to underscore that with praise for a prominent Republican ally of the first President Bush. She also noted that two of her three brothers were Republicans and that she loved them very much.\n\nThe third reason I appreciated this debate is because it so perfectly underscored the most prominent candidates\u2019 rationales for running and arguments for themselves. Apart from that odd exchange with Warren, Biden had a decent night, partly because he was given, and took advantage of, several opportunities to stress that he was more prepared for the presidency than anyone else and that the post-Trump era called for someone who wouldn\u2019t have a steep learning curve. The repair work must begin immediately.\n\nButtigieg made clear that what he offers, at the tender age of 37, is a truly fresh perspective. He had a superb night, because he embraced a role as Warren\u2019s inquisitor and because several supremely eloquent remarks about foreign policy \u2014 in particular, about Trump\u2019s withdrawal of American troops from Syria \u2014 allowed him to project a command and maturity that some voters needed to see to consider him seriously.\n\nCory Booker quintupled down on his pitch as the candidate of love \u2014 and was so expansively loving to several of the other Democrats, including Kamala Harris and Biden, that I found myself wondering if this debate was a bid to salvage a flagging campaign or the beginning of an audition to be the eventual nominee\u2019s running mate. As for Harris, she had strong moments, but they were neither strong nor frequent enough to alter her fortunes.\n\nThis was the most crowded televised presidential debate ever, with 12 candidates, so I\u2019d need the column equivalent of \u201cWar and Peace\u201d to appraise all of them. Still I\u2019d feel remiss if I didn\u2019t note that Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack, seemed no less vigorous than he had before.\n\nBut Warren, not Sanders, was carrying the progressive mantle on Tuesday night, when her less liberal competitors sought with a new assertiveness to trip her up. I don\u2019t think that they quite succeeded.\n\nWarren exits this latest debate as strong as she entered it. And those of us who watched it understand her \u2014 the calculations behind her positioning, the potential miscalculations of her monumentally expensive plans and the profound conviction she summons \u2014 better than ever before. That\u2019s no small payoff for three long hours.\n\nI invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter.
