I would like to think I am very mobile and I can run the channels when needed, and I can finish. I can do the target man role too, I can head the ball and hold it up.\u201d\n\nMoore provided a platform for Daniel James and Gareth Bale, the Wales wingers, and headed home from James\u2019 excellent first-half cross. \u201cAs soon as I saw the ball from Dan go up in the air, I knew it was a goal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would not say there was a point when I did not think I would make it here. It was just when. It has been very up and down but the trajectory of my career is now on the up. I am fighting fit and I will keep going.\n\n\u201cI believe I have not got to this point just by luck. I\u2019m a very hard worker and I have given my all to get to this point in my career. Sometimes you have to look around and you see these players and think \u2018wow\u2019. But at the end of the day it\u2019s a football match and it\u2019s 11 versus 11.\u201d\n\nMoore was playing for Forest Green Rovers, which led to an appearance for England C, while many of his current international team-mates were excelling at Euro 2016. Giggs first took an interest in the striker during Moore\u2019s spell at Rotherham United, on loan from Ipswich Town, in the 2017-18 season.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I joined Barnsley, we were trying to get the documents from my grandad to become eligible,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201c[Giggs] just said to be a nuisance and try to hold the ball up, win everything and give their defence a hard time. I believe I did that and I am very thankful for the opportunity. I will always bleed for the cause.\u201d", "description": "Kieffer Moore has described himself as a \u201cvery unusual\u201d threat for Wales as he prepares to continue his remarkable rise from non-league football by leading the line for Ryan Giggs\u2019 side against World Cup finalists Croatia this weekend.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Jason Burt", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212636538-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyKbbTIvVbvqvypOgwykjr4579h87TgycjIUSudEg3sI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
