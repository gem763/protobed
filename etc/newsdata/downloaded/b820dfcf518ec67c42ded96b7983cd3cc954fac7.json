He reacted to the team\u2019s announcement on social media.\n\n\u201cThe God of victory is also God in failure,\u201d Watson wrote on Twitter. \u201cI gave my all, but it was not enough to earn a spot on the @Patriots roster. I\u2019m beyond disappointed but even more upset for my family who has supported me with all the love a husband and father could ask for. They are my heroes.\u201d\n\nThe decision to release Watson leaves the Patriots with fourth-year veteran Matt LaCosse and second-year pro Ryan Izzo at the tight end position. LaCosse missed time earlier in the season with an ankle injury but played Sunday against the Washington Redskins.\n\nThe Patriots created about $2 million in salary-cap space by not activating Watson.\n\nNew England originally selected Watson in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft out of Georgia. He played six seasons with the franchise before spending time with the Cleveland Browns, New Orleans Saints and Baltimore Ravens.\n\nIn 195 career games, Watson has recorded 530 receptions for 5,885 yards and 44 receiving touchdowns. His best season came in 2015 with the Saints, when he notched career highs in catches (74) and receiving yards (825) with six touchdowns.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 The New England Patriots released veteran tight end Benjamin Watson, the team announced Monday.
