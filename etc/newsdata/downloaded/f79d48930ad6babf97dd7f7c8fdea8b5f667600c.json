File/Dean Mitchell\n\nThe interest appears to be sparked by prolonged depressed trading in Japara\u2019s shares, which can be put down to a combination of company factors and sentiment towards the aged care sector as a whole. The stock is trading at 10-times forward EBITDA.\n\nMoving on Moelis\u2019 stake \u2013 or Japara more broadly \u2013 would be a bold move. The aged care sector is subject to a royal commission and industry players reckon it will be at least another year before there will be any concrete resolutions.\n\nAged care providers seem pretty confident that the royal commission will lead to improved funding conditions and that, in the end, they will get the all clear. However, there\u2019s always a chance things could go awry.\n\nSo perhaps the tyrekicking is best viewed as a potential deep value play \u2013 or just some parties wanting to be ready for when the royal commission findings land.", "description": "There are some brave souls back sniffing around listed aged care provider Japara Healthcare.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2896c543a5f6ccd39cf94dfdf91fa064c0c91859", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
