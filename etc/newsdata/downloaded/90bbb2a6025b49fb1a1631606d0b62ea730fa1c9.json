Just hours after it was reported one of the Game of Thrones prequels was axed, another prequel \u2013 a completely different one \u2013 has received a full straight-to-series order at HBO.\n\nSo earlier this morning, Variety reported one of the prequel pilots \u2013 the one starring Naomi Watts \u2013 would not be going to series. In other words, the network binned it.\n\nHBO had apparently passed on the project, according to sources. A whole cast was already locked in with the likes of Josh Whitehouse, Naomi Ackie, Denise Gough, Jamie Campbell Bower, and Sheila Atim attached to star.\n\nNow, Variety says another prequel based on the Game of Thrones companion book Fire & Blood has copped a straight-to-series order at HBO. This one\u2019s called House of the Dragon, and is set 300 years before the events of Game of Thrones. HBO has ordered 10 episodes, which will focus on House Targaryen.\n\nGoT director Miguel Sapochnik will helm the first episode and a slew of others. He directed the Battle of the Bastards, Winds of Winter, and Hardhome episodes.\n\nAnd in welcome news, George R.R. Martin co-created the series with Ryan Condal who has Colony to his name.\n\nConfirming this is not word on the grapevine, HBO\u2019s president of programming Casey Bloys issued a statement about the Targaryen prequel.\n\n\u201cThe Game of Thrones universe is so rich with stories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to exploring the origins of House Targaryen and the earlier days of Westeros along with Miguel, Ryan, and George.\u201d\n\nAt one point, there were five (5!) \u201csuccessor shows\u201d in the works at HBO.
