Go to college, they said. Then get a good job, save for a down payment and buy a home. That was how they achieved financial success.\n\nSo she followed their playbook. She borrowed more than $165,000 to attend the University of Rochester, and then law school at Syracuse University. Now 32, she is a regulatory attorney in Seattle.\n\nBut things haven\u2019t gone as planned. Ms. Weeks still owes more than $140,000 on her student loans despite making monthly payments over the past decade. Home prices in Seattle have soared as the economy has boomed. In 1989, the median home price there was $77,300, or $163,773 in today\u2019s dollars, according to the National Association of Realtors. Today it\u2019s $542,700.\n\nSeattle attorney Liz Weeks owes more than $140,000 on her student loans, despite making payments for much of the past decade. \u201cI have been stressed about money since I was 11,\u201d she says. Photo: Ian Bates for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cI have been stressed about money since I was 11,\u201d Ms. Weeks said. \u201cThere was always this overarching sense of dread. The debt I have now colors so many of the decisions I make.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Weeks and her peers, the rules have changed. Americans entering the workforce in the decade since the financial crisis face a starkly different landscape than their parents did at the same age. They often have far higher student loan debt. Housing eats up a bigger chunk of each paycheck. And young households have lower incomes and fewer assets than previous generations did at the same ages.\n\nThe crushing weight of student loan debt and the steep rise in housing costs didn\u2019t happen overnight. But over three decades, these changes have reshaped the financial lives and dreams of young Americans. The personal-finance playbook followed by past generations\u2014take on \u201cgood debt\u201d for school, buy a home, then save up enough to send your own kids to their dream college\u2014doesn\u2019t add up for many people the way it used to.\n\nConsider:\n\n\u2022 College tuition has soared 1,375% since 1978, more than four times the rate of overall inflation, Labor Department data show.\n\nPrivate College As the price of college rose, students took on more and more debt to pay for it. Average tuition and fees for four years at a private nonprofit four-year institution Note: Values in 2018 dollars Source: College Board\n\nPublic College While public colleges and universities charge less than private institutions, the cost of both has risen sharply since 1979. Average tuition and fees for four years at a public nonprofit four-year institution Note: Values in 2018 dollars Source: College Board\n\n\u2022 Student loan debt has quadrupled since the start of 2005 to $1.48 trillion, according to the New York Federal Reserve, rising faster than any other form of household credit over that period.\n\n\u2022 Median rent nationally hit an all-time high of $1,008 a month in the second quarter of this year, according to Census Bureau data. It climbed 20% faster than the overall inflation rate from 1990 to 2016.\n\n\u2022 The typical U.S. home now sells for more than four times the median U.S. income, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. Between 1980 and 1999, home prices were closer to three times household income.\n\n\u2022 Given the savings rates of the millennial generation born between 1981 and 1996, rental-listing company Apartment List estimates that two-thirds of millennial renters would require at least two decades to save enough for a 20% down payment on a median-priced condo in their market. Just 11% would be able to amass a 20% down payment within the next five years.\n\n\u2022 The upshot: Millennial households had an average net worth of about $92,000 in 2016, nearly 40% less than Gen X households (people born between 1965 and 1980) had in 2001, adjusted for inflation, and about 20% less than baby boomer households (born from 1946 to 1964) had in 1989, according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\nSo it\u2019s time to kill the idea that student-loan debt is always \u201cgood debt,\u201d to admit that buying a house isn\u2019t always the right move, and to refashion these old expectations. It\u2019s time for a new playbook.\n\nEducational Debt Isn\u2019t Necessarily Good Debt\n\nSome parents tell their kids not to worry about taking on student-loan debt because it is \u201cgood debt.\u201d Investing in yourself is important, but it\u2019s possible to invest too much. It\u2019s important to consider your potential career path as well as your debt repayment strategy.\n\nPlenty of people are already in too deep. More than 2 million borrowers have defaulted on their loans in the past six years.\n\nTaking out loans isn\u2019t a guarantee you\u2019ll graduate. The think tank Third Way found that at more than a third of American colleges, less than half of the students will earn a credential within eight years.\n\nStudent loan debt has quadrupled since the start of 2005 to $1.48 trillion. Here, Liz Weeks' law degree in her apartment in Seattle.

Four in 10 recent college graduates are in jobs that don\u2019t require degrees, according to research from the New York Federal Reserve.\n\nAfter college, you may want to consider graduate school as a means of moving your career forward. But is it worth it to borrow tens or even hundreds of thousands for that advanced degree?\n\nIf your starting salary out of grad school will be more than the loans you take out to cover your education costs, it\u2019s probably a good investment, says Mark Kantrowitz, vice president of research at savingforcollege.com. If you check this box, you should be able to pay off your loans in 10 years or less. (There are exceptions, like doctors heading into low-paid training programs. In these cases, use the starting salary after residency and fellowship.)\n\nAverage debt for graduates of masters programs, by subject $50,102 $65,468 $56,964 International Relations Public Health Social Work $45,047 $49,821 $48,612 Nursing Urban Planning Journalism $43,217 $43,208 $30,417 Info.

Science Anthropology Education\n\nYou can also think incrementally. Is the amount you will gain in salary after completing a graduate program more than the debt that you must take on to get the degree? If so, it makes sense. For example, spending $50,000 to get a nursing degree is a good investment if your salary will immediately jump from $30,000 as a home health aide to $80,000 as a registered nurse.\n\nYou might not have to pay big bucks for a multiyear program to land the job you want. New specialized graduate degrees are becoming more popular. A master of business analytics, which generally takes one year to earn, might suit you better than a traditional two-year M.B.A. and leave you with less debt. Instead of a three-year law degree, check out master of legal studies programs. They take one to two years to complete, can often be done online and cost around $20,000 to $45,000\u2014often cheaper than a year of law school.\n\nMedicine $170,440 Law $119,250 Health Science* Legal Research $36,806 $71,071 Medicine $170,440 Law $119,250 Health Science* Legal Research $36,806 $71,071 Medicine $170,440 Law $119,250 Health Science* Legal Research $36,806 $71,071 Medicine Law $170,440 $119,250 Legal Research Health Science* $71,071 $36,806\n\nDon\u2019t Assume You Should Buy a Home\n\nA home of one\u2019s own remains an integral part of The American Dream.\n\nBut the thing is, a house may not always be a good investment. Especially in the hottest housing markets.\n\nSarah Behr, a financial planner and founder of Simplify Financial in San Francisco, said she cautions even those clients who can scrape together enough to buy a home that it may not be the right investment for them.\n\n\u201cHousing as an asset is expensive, so if you\u2019re not going to be somewhere for seven or eight years, it\u2019s hard to break even and hard to know if you\u2019ll make enough equity to offset the cost,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if it is attainable, it\u2019s not necessarily the best use of your money.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple things to keep in mind when you\u2019re considering home ownership. You may be one of the fortunate who already have the money to put down 20% for a down payment. But ask yourself: can you afford the monthly mortgage payments, or will it be hard to make ends meet? Have you depleted your savings entirely, putting you at risk for default if your employment situation changes? And lastly, per Ms. Behr\u2019s point, think about how long you plan on staying in this house\u2014maybe you\u2019re already restless and planning to move soon, in which case it might be hard to break even, especially if you factor in the considerable costs of closing on a home purchase.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best Place for Financial Growth?\n\nAnother achievement up for debate: living in your dream city. It might not be as dreamy as you think.\n\nYes, there are cool jobs in growing sectors, drawing young graduates to places like New York and San Francisco. But housing costs in those cities are high.\n\nHigh-Cost Housing Many young Americans still dream of owning their own home, but prices have risen dramatically in recent years, even after adjusting for inflation. Median sales price for existing single\u2011family homes Note: Values in 2018 dollars Source: National Association of Realtors\n\nSome make it work by living far outside the city center, where things are often cheaper, or by putting a hold on their financial goals to free up more room in the budget for pricier housing.\n\nOthers leave these places altogether. Austin, Texas, Nashville, Tenn., and Portland, Ore., are seeing a boom as workers leave big, pricey cities to instead work remotely in less expensive areas. Median home prices have still risen in these cities, but owning a home is more achievable. The median home price in Nashville, for example, was $276,800 in July 2019, still lower than the national media home price of $280,800, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nIf you want to get ahead in the game, think about where you want to live long term as you consider where you go to college or grad school. Unless you\u2019re at a top school, the employers coming to recruit on campus might largely be regional, so pick somewhere you think you\u2019d want to work after graduation, says Jill Tipograph, co-founder of Early Stage Careers, a coaching firm.\n\nNot All the Old Rules Are Dead\n\nPart of the generational disconnect is the idea that frugality alone will allow a responsible young professional to reach these financial goals. Ditch the Sweetgreen salads and dial back the spending on your fancy coffee, the advice goes, and you\u2019ll be able to afford that down payment in no time.\n\nBut Ms. Weeks, the Seattle attorney, already brings her lunch to work. She takes the bus. She and her husband, a leasing professional, have decided they\u2019d rather save money than celebrate their marriage with a wedding. They do hope to take a vacation, just the two of them\u2014something they still haven\u2019t done since they got married in 2017.\n\nLiz Weeks marinates chicken in her Seattle apartment. Rents in the U.S. climbed 20% faster than the overall inflation rate from 1990 to 2016. Photo: Ian Bates for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cFifteen dollars on lunch each day, times seven\u2014[bringing your lunch] might help a little bit, but it\u2019s not going to make a dent in the debt that\u2019s left,\u201d Ms. Weeks said. For her, amassing a down payment seems entirely out of reach right now.\n\nShe\u2019s not the only one. The homeownership rate for millennials was around 38% in 2017, according to research from the Urban Institute, about seven percentage points lower than the rate of Baby Boomers and Gen X-ers at the same age.\n\n\u201cOne of the expectations is you should be able to afford a house, and if you can\u2019t, it\u2019s seen as if you\u2019ve missed one of the rungs you\u2019re meant to climb up in your life,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cI think for other people, they just give up and say, \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen for me.\u2019 And I assume there\u2019s a certain level of disappointment and a sense of failure.\u201d\n\nWhen the disappointment sets in, some people can be put off of saving or goal-setting entirely. Without advice that feels relevant, they not only give up on traditional goals, but the methods as well.\n\nBut while throwing your hands up may provide some temporary relief, it won\u2019t cure this nagging sense of paralysis that holds so many people captive.\n\nIllustration: Zohar Lazar\n\nYou still need to know your numbers\u2014how much you make, how much you owe and how much you spend.\n\nAfter confronting the numbers, determine reasonable goals and rewards: if you\u2019re not buying a house right away, perhaps you\u2019re contributing to an investing goal or savings account instead. Set aside a small amount of money every month. You can automate a monthly deposit and account for that in your budget so you don\u2019t \u201cmiss\u201d the money and feel crunched on cash.\n\nFrom there, maybe you drop your savings in a high-interest savings account, or do your research and explore the world of investing. The cost of putting money to work in the stock market is lower than ever, especially if you keep it simple and invest in something like a low-fee S&P 500 index fund.\n\nRetirement savings may not be a physical asset like a house or a car, but that pile of money is ultimately the most important financial goal to keep on your list. If you\u2019re lucky enough to work for an employer that offers a 401(k) match, take advantage of it. If you don\u2019t have a 401(k), consider a Roth IRA, which will allow you to take money out for emergency expenses, and a health-savings account, which will help you escape tax penalties, should you need to withdraw for a medical expense.\n\nA savings account, a 401(k) or a health-savings account aren\u2019t tangible in the same way as a house, but they\u2019re plus marks in your asset column. And if you feel like you have something going right, if you\u2019re contributing in some small way to your future, you\u2019ll feel less helpless in the long run.\n\nThere\u2019s one more thing: Within reason, allow yourself some small joys. There\u2019s a difference between someone who saves some money and enjoys themselves occasionally and one who saves nothing and splurges on brunch every day. When you\u2019re feeling less helpless about your financial health, you can feel good about putting money toward the things that make life worth living.\n\nThe goal-setting isn\u2019t just important for young adults to understand, though; it\u2019s important for their parents to get it, too. A more realistic, empathetic conversation between the generations can also lead to more conversations about money, period.\n\nMs. Weeks knows her parents meant well when they told her college debt was \u201cgood debt,\u201d and they also weren\u2019t the only ones to dole out this mistaken advice.\n\n\u201cAs you get older, you learn your parents are fallible,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish they\u2019d been more upfront about how hard it was, because it feels like a moral failure when you can\u2019t reach these milestones.\u201d\n\nIn Which I Follow My Own Advice\n\nI applied this advice to my own life on a recent drive with my parents back home. I knew I wanted to talk with them about how they\u2019d seemingly so easily reached these huge goals.\n\nWhen they were 28, my parents were already married, with a kid and a house. At the same age, after a series of too-many-roommates scenarios, I now split rent with my girlfriend, and we\u2019re both on the same page when it comes to spending money. We budget together every month and we share a credit card, mostly for the convenience, but also for the points. One day, we want to own a home, but for now, we\u2019re just trying to save what we can without sacrificing the occasional dinner out. After seeing our friends drop thousands of dollars on weddings, we\u2019ve agreed a big party like that isn\u2019t in the cards right now.\n\nLess Powerful Paychecks When adjusted for inflation, overall wage stagnation has decreased purchasing power for many young Americans. Median annual income among those 25 to 34 years old Note: Values in 2018 dollars and include full-time wage and salary workers Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nI\u2019ve had to redefine so many of my goals. Home ownership, as much as I dream about it, just isn\u2019t a viable option for me right now, and like Ms. Behr suggested, I don\u2019t know if it would make the best use of my savings, either. Instead, I do what I can: I have taken advantage of every 401(k) match offered (in my first job, that was just 1%, but I was so excited) and I contribute every month to my savings and investing accounts. I want to learn more about investing and I still dream of buying a little house with a wide window seat, just like the ones I bookmark on Zillow. But for the time being, I feel comfortable just setting aside what I can.\n\nAnd as my dad told me, he and my mother didn\u2019t start \u201cpaying themselves\u201d until much later in their marriage. Before then, they were too busy putting money toward their mortgage, their credit card bills and their childcare costs. He said back then they simply didn\u2019t have the cash to stash in a savings account. In that way, I\u2019m already ahead of where they were at my age\u2014just not in a way I expected to be.\n\nThe last time I visited my parents, we talked about my own goals. I want to go to graduate school one day, but I\u2019m afraid of taking on that much debt. I still want to buy a home, but a down payment feels incredibly elusive to me. My parents, to their credit, tried to understand.\n\nThey bought their first home in the 1980s: a one-bedroom starter home in Decatur, Ga. With some help from my grandfather, they came up with $10,000 for their first down payment (around $22,200 in today\u2019s dollars).\n\n\u201cYou know, nowadays 10% isn\u2019t enough,\u201d I told my mother, reminding her of how she and my dad afforded their first house. Lending practices have changed. \u201cA lot of times, you have to have 20% already saved for your down payment.\u201d\n\nShe was shocked. \u201cWho can save up 20% for a down payment?\u201d\n\n\u2014Rachel Feintzeig, Laura Kusisto and Josh Mitchell contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Julia Carpenter at Julia.Carpenter@wsj.com", "description": "The personal-finance playbook followed by past generations doesn\u2019t add up for many people.
