It is almost unheard of for a mainstream Hollywood studio film to win the Venice film festival\u2019s Golden Lion. And it is unheard of for Venice\u2019s winner, usually an erudite art film, to inspire grotesque hate speech from fans on social media should anyone be the least bit critical.\n\nA violent look at \u201chow Batman\u2019s foe got that way,\u201d Joker has been hailed as revolutionary for its depiction of mental illness, but \u2013 at least in gun-toting America \u2013 screenings have been suggested as a potential trigger of violence. There\u2019s been no shortage of conversation around Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s movie but until now, as is so often the case online, few people had actually seen it. Until now. Here are the pressing topics, only some of which are worth laughing about.\n\nIs Joker actually a comic book movie?\n\nTodd Phillips, who is as crafty with the press as Mr Terrific is with T-Spheres, has said that he convinced Phoenix to appear in his supervillain origin story by suggesting they would \u201csneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic-book film\u201d. This does not sound like someone who is particularly enamoured of the genre. \u201cLet\u2019s make a real movie with a real budget and call it fucking Joker,\u201d he continued. He\u2019s cited movies by Martin Scorsese and (surprisingly) Chantal Akerman as influences. So the question is: is this movie really that different?\n\nWe\u2019ll give Philips the points here. This is lightyears away from zippy, agreeable fare like, say, Ant-Man and the Wasp or Thor: Ragnarok. Even the so-called \u201cgrimdark\u201d superhero movies like Batman v Superman or Watchmen feel like an entirely different genre. While Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Arthur Fleck does paint his face, and eventually masks do come into play, there are no costumes and certainly no stylised slugfests. This is a dark and (eventually) gruesomely violent drama that is nihilistic and performance-driven. It isn\u2019t about special effects.\n\nJoker review \u2013 Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s villain has last laugh in twisted tale Read more\n\nComic book enthusiasts will still, however, find a few examples of their beloved DC lore. Arthur Fleck (which is what the Joker is named in this version) pays a visit to Arkham State Hospital, a tweak on the Arkham Asylum from the comics. The more exciting connections come with the Wayne family. For a stretch it is suggested that Thomas Wayne might actually be Arthur\u2019s father. This turns out to be a red herring, but not before Arthur heads up to Wayne Manor and makes contact with the young Bruce Wayne \u2026 who playfully slides down a pole at some point. That\u2019s right \u2013 an ur-Bat Pole! (Note: this is just about the only moment of levity in the entire picture.)\n\nDuring the big climax, we see, once again, Bruce\u2019s parents get killed. In some of these tellings (notably Tim Burton\u2019s version) culpability is laid at Joker\u2019s feet. The new movie offers a clever twist. As the dispossessed citizens of Gotham City rally around Joker as some sort of political hero, it\u2019s just some random thug in a clown mask who kills the famous zillionaires, not Joker himself. (In a nice spin, they are still outside a theatre showing Zorro, but it\u2019s the dopey 1981 comedy Zorro, the Gay Blade.)\n\nSympathy for the incel\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Triggers \u2026 most of the character\u2019s anger is rooted in circumstance. Photograph: Allstar/DC Comics/Warner Bros\n\nIs this movie really just the biggest-budget Ben Shapiro video? To what extent will misogynistic creeps \u201cfeel seen\u201d in this film? Well, for most of its run time, it isn\u2019t quite the alt-right manifesto some of the pre-release discourse suggested. It\u2019s really just a drama about a mentally ill man with no friends who is targeted by bullies, lives with his mother, is ignored by the attractive woman down the hall and only finds purpose in mass murder.\n\nWait, I know that sounds like it is sympathy for the incel, but Fleck\u2019s anger, for most of the movie, stays rooted in his own circumstances. He isn\u2019t really railing against PC culture or how he\u2019s owed anything, like a guy who won\u2019t stop talking about Jordan Peterson. It\u2019s more of a generic \u201cMy life sucks!\u201d cry than an \u201cOur life sucks, brothers!\u201d\n\nIn the final reel, though, there is some angry monologuing, and some of those \u201cNobody cares!\u201d talking points come through, but the writing is too vague and incoherent to really land a point.\n\nAwards for Joaquin\n\nHeath Ledger won an Oscar posthumously for playing Joker. Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Bafta and a Golden Globe. Does Joaquin Phoenix have a shot at a statuetee? Anything\u2019s possible, I suppose, but if it were up to me, I would say heck no. I like when awards go to best acting not most acting.\n\nPhoenix\u2019s mimicry of the pseudobulbar affect (a psychological disorder that causes uncontrollable laughter, coughs, bleats and whimpers) is accurate, at least based on one YouTube video I found. But this is a surface thing. There\u2019s little depth to the character other than, you know, he\u2019s nuts! Time Magazine\u2019s Stephanie Zacharek said it best when she called him \u201ca chicken bone soaked in Coca-Cola\u201d.\n\nA few great scenes\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Grit \u2026 Joaquin Phoenix as Joker on the subway. Photograph: Allstar/DC Comics/Warner Bros\n\nBy now you\u2019ve sussed out that I\u2019m not really a fan of Joker. I mostly found it bleak and juvenile. But it is not without merit. The location photography in Newark, New Jersey and the Bronx captures some real grit. The big finish, while dumb from a story point of view, is marvellously shot. And the big acts of violence are effectively rattling.\n\nJoker review \u2013 the most disappointing film of the year Read more\n\nThere\u2019s one moment that shows a true creative spark. Two of Fleck\u2019s old work buddies come to visit him. One (Glenn Fleshler) has long been a jerk, so Fleck, now a killer, stabs him, spraying blood all over the place. The other guy (Leigh Gill), is horrified, but since he was always nice to Fleck, he\u2019s not in danger. Fleck says he can leave and, quaking in terror, Gill heads toward the door. It is, unfortunately, latched from up high and as Gill has dwarfism he can\u2019t reach. It\u2019s absolutely chilling to hear this man ask someone who just butchered a person for help.\n\nPart of why this scene works is that it plays to Phillips\u2019s strengths. While it keeps Gill\u2019s dignity intact (he\u2019s one of the few nice people in the film) it\u2019s still a bit of business that finds humour in interaction with dwarfism. For better or worse, that\u2019s the kind of thing Phillips built his career on with bro comedies like The Hangover. It\u2019s sure footing for him, far less so than nihilistic drama.\n\nUnnecessary Glitter\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Catharsis \u2026 Robert De Niro. Photograph: Allstar/DC Comics/Warner Bros\n\nOnce Joker has more than a few kills under his belt, he heads into Robert De Niro\u2019s TV studio for his big catharsis. There\u2019s a psych-up scene as he dances outside his apartment, so there\u2019s a pop song needle-drop. Phillips chooses Gary Glitter\u2019s Rock and Roll Part 2. It\u2019s a song you absolutely know, even if the title doesn\u2019t ring a bell. More to the point, especially from a guy recently quoted as saying that \u201cwoke culture\u201d has torn him away from comedy, it\u2019s a song recorded by a convicted child sex offender. Todd Phillips really is a troll.\n\n", "description": "Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s cackling baddie is unleashed today \u2013 here\u2019s your chance to talk about whether Todd Phillips is trolling us, or if his film deserves all the Oscars it can get", "authors": ["Jordan Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e9950326e232b0ec6a5601217171c3fe34df69c/0_360_3534_2120/master/3534.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f57a5117130bdeea92cea372caef6689", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
