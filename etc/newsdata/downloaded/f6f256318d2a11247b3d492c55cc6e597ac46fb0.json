The cost per print is estimated to be RMB0.014 ($0.002),' said Dr Zhao.\n\n'Most fluorescent security inks on the market used to record confidential information are environmentally unfriendly and cannot be erased. The paper is only a disposable recording medium.'\n\nThe researchers are now looking to refine and improve the method.\n\n'Our work is to provide a practical printing method. Thus, we need to make sure that it's non-toxic or has low harm to the human body,' says Dr Zhao.\n\n'That's why we use manganese complexes, which are environmentally friendly and low in toxicity.'\n\nThe research was published in the journal Cell.", "description": "Chinese scientists have created an invisible ink which would be ideal for keeping precious information out of unwanted hands.
