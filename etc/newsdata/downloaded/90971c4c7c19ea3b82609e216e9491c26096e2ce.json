(AP) \u2014 The Latest on the wildfires in California (all times local):\n\n8:45 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say crews will work through the night battling a wind-whipped wildfire that has damaged or destroyed at least six homes north of Los Angeles.\n\nAuthorities say the blaze that erupted Thursday in Canyon Country has spread to 6 square miles (15 square kilometers) and is uncontained.\n\nAuthorities say the initial fire spread embers that started spot fires that have been contained.\n\nNo injuries have been reported, but at least 40,000 people remain under evacuation orders.\n\nThe fire was spread by hot, gusty Santa Ana winds that eased a bit after nightfall but are expected to resume, possibly with greater force, overnight into Friday.\n\nTo prevent power lines from being toppled by the winds and sparking wildfires, Southern California Edison cut power to more than 27,000 customers on Thursday. The utility is considering additional power cuts to more than 386,000 customers.\n\n___\n\n7:40 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say a wind-whipped fire in Northern California's wine country has burned 49 buildings and prompted evacuation orders for 2,000 people.\n\nThe fire that began Wednesday night near Geyserville had grown Thursday night to 25 square miles (65 square kilometers).\n\nFire officials say 1,300 firefighters will work through the night and hundreds more may join the battle Friday morning.\n\nThe cause is under investigation but Pacific Gas & Electric says it had a transmission line problem in the area minutes before the fire was reported.\n\nPG&E had cut power to parts of 17 counties to prevent wind-related power line problems that might spark fires but said it didn't deenergize the transmission line because wind speeds there didn't call for it.\n\nIn the south, crews are fighting two wind-whipped fires north of Los Angeles that have burned at least a handful of homes and prompted evacuation orders for 40,000 people.\n\n___\n\n6:40 p.m.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric Co. is informing officials of another massive power shutdown expected this weekend throughout Northern California starting Saturday night and lasting into Monday.\n\nThe shutdown could affect 2 million people, much like a widespread pre-emptive blackout earlier this month.\n\nIt would be the third such shutdown in three weeks.\n\nUtility officials said Thursday that forecasters are warning of the strongest winds this season, and possibly the strongest winds in years. They said hot, dry winds could knock over utility equipment and spark wildfires.\n\nPG&E chief executive Bill Johnson said the utility will have a better idea Friday of which areas would lose power and how long the outages might last.\n\nNotice was given to counties in the Sierra foothills and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n___\n\n6:30 p.m.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric says it's too soon to know whether faulty equipment started a wind-whipped fire in Northern California wine country.\n\nThe utility told state regulators that it learned of a transmission level outage on Wednesday night in the Geysers, the world's largest geothermal field. The wildfire was reported minutes later in the same area.\n\nCEO Bill Johnson said Thursday that conducting wire on a PG&E transmission tower malfunctioned but that authorities haven't determined what started the fire.\n\nJohnson said the tower is 43 years old, which isn't uncommon in the industry, and had been inspected four times in the last two years. He said the tower appears to have been in \"excellent condition.\"\n\nPG&E cut power to distribution lines in the area, but not transmission lines because the wind speed didn't call for it.\n\n___\n\n6 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say they've ordered at least 40,000 people to evacuate as wind-driven fires rage near neighborhoods north of Los Angeles.\n\nSeveral homes burned Thursday as two fires fanned by powerful winds swept through dry brush to the edge of communities in the Santa Clarita area. No injuries have been immediately reported.\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby says there is no containment of either blaze.\n\nThe flames are fed by dry winds that are predicted to strengthen across the region. Forecasters say peak gusts could top 70 mph (112 kph).\n\n___\n\n5:35 p.m.\n\nA utility says it had a problem with a transmission tower near where a wildfire ignited in Northern California wine country, prompting a large evacuation.", "description": "Authorities say crews will work through the night battling a wind-whipped wildfire that has damaged or destroyed at least six homes north of Los Angeles.
