FOREX-Sterling gives up some gains as Brexit optimism curbed\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n* Britain, EU rushing to agree Brexit terms\n\n* Sterling loses gains in Asia\n\n* Markets still digesting U.S.-China trade disappointment\n\n\n\nBy Stanley White\n\nTOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The British pound fell from its\n\nhighest level in almost five months versus the U.S. dollar on\n\nWednesday as investors started to question their optimism about\n\nBritain's negotiations to leave the European Union.\n\nSterling also pulled back from its highest in five months\n\nagainst the euro as investors booked profit and prepared for a\n\nmake-or-break summit between Britain and the EU on Thursday and\n\nFriday.\n\nThe focus is on last-ditch talks that dragged on late into\n\nTuesday night to see whether the two sides can draft an\n\nagreement on Brexit before the summit.\n\nReports the pair were getting closer to an agreement boosted\n\nsterling overnight, though traders said sterling could swing\n\nwildly because it is still unclear if Britain can avoid\n\npostponing its departure beyond Oct. 31.\n\n\"Even if the two sides can agree something, it is unclear if\n\nthey can stick with the exit deadline,\" said Yukio Ishizuki,\n\nforeign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\"Whether Britain's parliament will approve whatever has been\n\nagreed is another big uncertainty. Sterling had a good run-up,\n\nbut some investors are lightening their positions.\"\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 fell 0.20% to $1.2758, pulling back from\n\na five-month high of $1.2800 reached on Tuesday.\n\nAgainst the euro EURGBP=D3 , the British currency fell\n\naround 0.23% to 86.51 pence. On Tuesday, sterling hit 86.25\n\npence per euro, the strongest since May 10.\n\nThe pound on Tuesday jumped after Bloomberg News reported\n\nthat negotiators hoped an agreement would be reached by midnight\n\non Tuesday in Europe, but a lack of news in Asia about the\n\nresults of the talks helped push the currency lower, traders\n\nsaid.\n\nWithout a Brexit deal, trade from Britain that previously\n\nflowed unhindered across the EU's single market would be subject\n\nto customs tariffs and safety inspections, which many fear would\n\ncause economic turmoil.\n\nThe yen JPY=EBS held steady at 108.81 per dollar, within\n\nstriking distance of a two-month low.\n\nThe Japanese currency initially weakened on Tuesday due to\n\nhopes Britain will avoid a messy no-deal Brexit, but those gains\n\nwere countered in Asia on Wednesday by growing disappointment\n\nwith U.S. efforts to scale back its trade war with China.\n\nReports of a \"Phase 1\" trade deal between the United States\n\nand China last week initially cheered markets but the dearth\n\nof details around the agreement has since curbed any\n\nenthusiasm.\n\nThe dollar index against a basket of six currencies\n\nrose slightly to 0.03% to 98.322.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Sterling gives up some gains as Brexit optimism curbed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0O0HA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
