The probe includes attorneys general from 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. California and Alabama are not involved in the probe, Paxton said at a press conference.\n\nOther attorneys general at the media conference emphasized Google's dominance in the ad market and use of consumer data.\n\n\"When there is no longer a free market or competition, this increases prices, even when something is marketed as free, and harms consumers,\" said Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, a Republican. \"Is something really free if we are increasingly giving over our privacy information? Is something really free if online ad prices go up based on one company's control?\"\n\nAn antitrust probe into Facebook was announced on Friday by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who will lead the case. Attorneys general from seven states plus the District of Columbia are participating in the Facebook investigation.\n\nAt the press conference Monday, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat, said it \"remains to be seen\" if the two probes will be \"a coordinated expansion.\"", "description": "The news follows the announcement of a joint state Facebook probe led by the attorney general of New York.", "authors": ["Lauren Feiner"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105430033-1568054537671pichai.jpg?v=1568054563", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
