We are playing the greatest team that has ever been in sport.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\u201cBut like any team they are beatable, there are ways to beat them and we will be investigating every possible way.\u201d\n\nJones refused to sympathise with the country of his birth after avenging England\u2019s elimination from the 2015 tournament by the Wallabies.\n\nIrritated at the suggestion he should feel sorry for the team he used to coach, Jones said: \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to be a sympathy person. My job is to coach England.\n\n(Image: AFLO/Press Association Images)\n\n\u201cIf you win you are happy, if you lose you are bloody sad. But let\u2019s not get too emotional and silly about this\u2026 I\u2019m not an Australian, I\u2019m coaching England. I\u2019m an England coach.\u201d\n\nOne, he reiterated, which has a mighty job on its hands to stop the All Blacks\u2019 bid to complete an unprecedented hat-trick of Webb Ellis trophy wins.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cIf you look at their record they have won 84 per cent of their Tests since the last World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cName me another team in the world playing at the absolute top level that does that.\n\n\u201cTo do what they do from a small country is incredible. You have to admire them, but then the challenge is to beat them.\u201d\n\nEngland will pray for the fitness of Jonny May who tweaked a hamstring after marking his 50th cap with two tries.", "description": "\u201cWe are playing the greatest team that has ever been in sport.
