In February 2015, U.S. officials confirmed that she had died while in ISIS custody, but her body was never recovered.\n\nPHOTO: Kayla Mueller seen on her travels in this undated photo.

Delta Force killed Abu Sayyaf in May 2015 and captured Umm Sayyaf, who previously held Kayla Mueller captive in their home for al-Baghdadi to sexually assault.\n\nCarl Mueller said they went \"against the advice of the FBI,\" over the summer to find out what may have happened to their daughter's remains -- or if she could still be alive.\n\n(MORE: Defense secretary offers more details on military raid in Syria, al-Baghdadi's death)\n\n\"When we talked to Umm Sayyaf, we found we got more information out of her, not just us, the people backing us - they got information from her that neither the Kurds or the US government had got in the two days that we were there,\" Carl Mueller said. \"It makes a big difference when you are talking to these people with a humanitarian attitude. We don't care what you did, what you've done - we just want to know what you know about our daughter to bring her home.\"\n\nPHOTO: Kayla Mueller poses after speaking to a group in Prescott, Ariz., May 30, 2013.

That's what we're pursuing and that's what we hope that President Trump will help us with.\"\n\nThe couple said they had filed requests under the Freedom of Information Act to gather more information about how she may have died. The requests were denied, and they're considering taking legal action to receive documents related to her death.\n\nCarl and Marsha Mueller seen here at the Prescott, Arizona, playground named 'Kayla's Hands' in honor of their daughter, Kayla Mueller.
