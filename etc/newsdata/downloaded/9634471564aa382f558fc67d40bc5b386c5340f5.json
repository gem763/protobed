Funds raised from the sale will be reinvested in crime prevention efforts, according to the ERSOU.\n\nMore than 7,500 bids were placed on the auction which was separated into 62 different sales, Wilsons Auctions said, with bids coming from various countries including Brazil, Australia, the U.S. and Singapore. It also noted that a single bitcoin achieved an average sale price of \u00a36,798.80 \u2014 close to its current trading price.\n\nThe assets were seized from an unnamed hacker who \"illegally supplied online personal data and hacking services in exchange for thousands of pounds worth of cryptocurrency,\" ERSOU said in a press release Monday.\n\nBBC News reported Monday that the digital currency had come from a teenager who received a jail sentence in August for hacking British internet provider TalkTalk.\n\n\"Asset recovery in a digital world has evolved, so it's really important that we have a clear process for the storage and sale of cryptocurrency,\" Detective Chief Inspector Martin Peters of the ERSOU cybercrime unit said in the press release.\n\n\"This goes to show there is no place to hide criminal assets \u2014 we are constantly developing our techniques and capabilities to ensure that proceeds of crime are either given back to the rightful owner or, as in this case, are reinvested in crime,\" he added.\n\nERSOU noted that all of the buyers who took part in the auction were approved \"ethical users of cryptocurrency,\" with each participant's background checked by a specialist.\n\nAlthough last week's auction was the first of its kind in the U.K., it was the latest in a series of seized crypto sales that have gone ahead internationally.\n\nU.S. prosecutors have previously auctioned off seized bitcoin and cryptocurrency assets, with the U.S. Marshals Service raising $18.7 million from a bitcoin auction last year, according to Coindesk.\n\nMeanwhile, Wilsons Auctions raised \u00a3550,000 ($676,580) in March from an auction of bitcoins seized by the Belgian government.", "description": "Police in the U.K. raised almost $300,000 by auctioning off a convicted hacker's cryptocurrency haul, which included bitcoin, ripple and ether.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105719380-1549330544338gettyimages-1030734148.jpeg?v=1569933622", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
