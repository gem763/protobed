Neither meeting has yielded any concrete progress toward a deal, with North Korea suggesting that it would like to see relief from sanctions before taking any steps to denuclearize.\n\nHe also appeared to ridicule Trump\u2019s fixation on the spectacle of meeting with Kim, arguing that even a partial agreement would disproportionately benefit North Korea.\n\n\u201cThey want a piece of something that we should not be prepared to give them,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nAfter outlining several paths toward diplomacy \u2014 including \u201climited\u201d regime change and military force \u2014 that have a slim chance of coming to fruition under Trump, Bolton asserted that one of the consequences of letting North Korea go unchecked was that they could become \u201cthe Walmart or the Amazon of deliverable nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are questions that need to focus our attention, not can we get another summit with Kim Jong Un or what the state of staff-level negotiations are to achieve a commitment from North Korea it will never honor,\u201d he continued.\n\nBolton also doubled down on calls to implement a \u201cLibya model\u201d when dealing with North Korea, comments that Trump derisively cited as detrimental to U.S.-North Korea relations after Bolton\u2019s exit. And Bolton countered Trump\u2019s repeated assertions that the U.S. is in \u201cno rush\u201d to push Kim to wind down his nuclear programs while taking an indirect shot at his former boss for his lackadaisical attitude toward recent short-range missile tests in North Korea.\n\nWhile Trump has said those tests were not a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, Bolton on Monday sided with anxious U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea in declaring that they were. Moreover, he added, Trump\u2019s apparent disregard for the resolutions undermines U.S. policy by giving off the message that its leadership doesn\u2019t care about the sanctions in those or other U.N. resolutions.\n\n\u201cWhen you ask for consistent behavior from others, you have to demonstrate it yourself and when we fail to do that we open ourselves \u2014 and our policy \u2014 to failure,\u201d Bolton warned.\n\nIn defending his leniency about the short-range tests, which have alarmed allies, Trump has said they are preferable to testing intercontinental ballistic missiles or conducting other kinds of nuclear tests. But Bolton cautioned against complacency because of this switch, contending that it \u201ctells us nothing about either North Korea\u2019s intention or its strategy as it\u2019s playing out.\u201d\n\nOne potential and \u201cvery troubling\u201d reason behind the switch, he suggested, \u201cis that North Korea has, in its judgment, for well or ill, finished testing and can produce nuclear warheads and long range ballistic missiles.\u201d\n\nBolton didn't disagree with Trump across the board, noting that he too wanted \"better burden sharing\" from U.S. allies especially in the context of NATO. But \"this is not the time for U.S. disengagement and withdrawal. This is the time for more U.S. involvement and leadership on the Korean peninsula, in Asia and worldwide,\" he concluded. \"More, not less.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5e/e6/0905fa48457eb133608bddaec300/bolton.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
