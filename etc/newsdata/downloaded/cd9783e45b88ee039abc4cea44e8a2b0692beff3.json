REUTERS/Maria Cervantes\n\nWhispering \u201cJesusan namanguinde,\u201d or \u201cthe body of Christ\u201d in the tongue of the indigenous Achuar people, Yampik gives communion bread to villagers in a small chapel amid a loud chorus of birds and insects outside.\n\nA tribal elder with 10 grown children, Yampik, 48, is a leading Catholic figure in one of the Church\u2019s most remote outposts.\n\nBut because Yampik is married, he cannot become a priest. He is an ordained deacon, a lower rank. That means he cannot hear confessions or, more importantly, say Mass, the key sacrament that villagers in Wijint must go many months without because of a lack of priests. The communion bread he distributes is consecrated beforehand by a priest in another town.\n\nBut Yampik and other Achuar Catholics in this vast region are hopeful a historic meeting at the Vatican next month will change that.\n\nOn Oct. 6, Pope Francis will open a three-week synod of Amazonian bishops where one of the most keenly awaited topics will be whether to allow Yampik and other married men to be ordained as priests in parts of the Amazon, a proposal that would break centuries of Roman Catholic tradition.\n\nThe idea is to allow older married men with grown children and a strong standing in the Church - \u201cviri probati\u201d or proven men - to join the priesthood and help fill a gap in their communities.\n\n\u201cI feel it in my heart. I want to be a priest,\u201d Yampik, who like other Achuar in the region was converted by Catholic missionaries decades ago, told Reuters in Wijint.\n\nA three-day boat ride from the nearest town with paved roads, Wijint is one of 827 native communities in the Vicariate of Yurimaguas, a region nearly the size of Panama ministered by just 25 priests, the vicariate\u2019s administrator, Reverend Jesus Maria Aristin told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to reach them all,\u201d Aristin said, recalling a recent visit to a village that required a four-day day trek through jungle marshlands.\n\nAt least 85% of villages in the region cannot celebrate Mass every week, a ritual in which Catholics believe communion bread and wine are transformed into the body and blood of Jesus.\n\nYampik is one of four married \u201cviri probati\u201d Achuar deacons who will be discussed for the priesthood at the synod, said Aristin, who will attend.\n\nCELIBACY OR SACRAMENT?\n\nThe synod will also discuss protection for the Amazon after a global outcry over forest fires this year. But the \u201cviri probati\u201d proposal could be more explosive within the Church, where Francis is already under attack by its conservative wing.\n\nThe synod\u2019s working document, branded heretical by its critics, says men could be ordained in the priesthood \u201ceven if they already have an established and stable family, in order to guarantee the sacraments.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the reform say it will introduce a slippery slope leading to the abolition of the Church\u2019s rule on priestly celibacy, which became obligatory in the 12th century in part to keep children of priests from inheriting Church property.\n\nThe Church teaches that by remaining celibate and unmarried, a priest can devote himself entirely to God and the Church.\n\nBut the requirement has crimped efforts to recruit priests to minister to all its current members - much less expand - in traditional strongholds like Latin America, where evangelical Christians are making inroads.\n\n\u201cViri probati\u201d proponents also say the Church cannot neglect faithful in places like Wijint, a village with no electricity or running water where the Achuar grow cassava root and bananas and hunt wild pigs in surrounding forests.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more important, celibacy or the Eucharist, the centre of Christian life?\u201d said Aristin.\n\nJust four decades ago, the Church\u2019s presence in this far-flung region was growing, thanks to Italian priest Luis Bolla\u2019s success in converting isolated Indians in Peru and Ecuador.\n\nA Salesian missionary, Bolla lived among the Achuar for decades, adopting their customs and language, and leaving a void when he died in 2013.\n\nToday, it is hard to get outsiders to stay in Achuar villages, said Yampik.\n\n\u201cA priest outside of this culture can give himself to us but just for a season. Then he says, \u2018I can\u2019t get used to this. I can\u2019t learn the language. I can\u2019t talk,\u2019\u201d Yampik said.\n\n\u201cAn Achuar priest would be ours. Where\u2019s he going to go?\u201d\n\nDARING PROPOSALS\n\nThe Vatican has allowed some leeway before. Some Anglican priests who were already married when they converted to Roman Catholicism were able to continue to serve as priests.\n\nBut it has not made an exception to its celibacy rule for the purpose of addressing shortages of priests. It is a discipline, though, not a dogma, and therefore can be changed.\n\nThe synod does not make decisions. Only the pope can. Participants will vote on various articles in a final document, which will then go to the pope to decide whether to make it into an official Apostolic Exhortation.\n\nAristin said he was hopeful Francis would relax the celibacy rule for the Achuar. He recalled Francis\u2019 excitement when the pope met Yampik and other local \u201cviri probati\u201d on his 2018 visit to Peru.\n\n\u201cFrancis, who\u2019s always a bit mischievous, winked at me and said \u2018make some daring proposals for the synod,\u2019\u201d Aristin said.\n\nThe \u201cviri probati\u201d proposal is backed by all Catholic congregations in the Vicariate of Yurimaguas. It has also fuelled calls for bolder change, including among nuns, who outnumber priests in the Amazon and often carry out the bulk of missionary work in remote areas.\n\n\u201cWe sisters clamour for the Achuar deacons to be ordained,\u201d said Maruja Escalante, a nun with the Missionaries of Mary Immaculate and Catherine of Siena order. \u201cI also think it\u2019s important that a woman can become a priest,\u201d she added.\n\nPope Francis, however, has said that the door to a female priesthood was closed by his predecessor Pope John Paul, and that he would not open it.\n\nCHURCH WITH AN \u2018INDIGENOUS FACE\u2019\n\nAchuar is among the last Amazonian tribes to come into regular contact with non-natives and traditionally practiced polygamy and shamanism. To win converts, Bolla infused ancient Catholic rites with indigenous customs, a tradition Yampik keeps alive today.\n\nIn the prayer service Yampik led in Wijint, girls sang Achuar ancestral chants to praise the Virgin Mary as villagers gathered around a fire built with three logs, a native ritual adopted to symbolize the Holy Trinity.\n\nThat multicultural approach, once considered avant-garde, today is celebrated by the Church under Pope Francis, who has called for a Church with an \u201cAmazonian and indigenous face.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\n\u201cFather Bolla had a special vision. He said, \u2018evangelization here has to be done without disrupting their culture,\u2019\u201d said Reverend Vicente Santilli, the head of the Salesian House in the Peruvian capital Lima.\n\nYampik, who like Bolla draws a cross on his forehead in the red face paint of the Achuar, said allowing \u201cviri probati\u201d to become priests would bring his tribe closer to the Church.\n\n\u201cThe Achuar are also preaching the word of God,\u201d Yampik said. \u201cWe want to be recognised, because here in this corner of the Amazon we don\u2019t feel acknowledged.\u201d", "description": "Just before dawn, Shainkiam Yampik beats a drum carved from a tree trunk at the start of a Roman Catholic prayer service in Wijint, a hamlet of thatched-roof huts in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon.", "authors": ["Maria Cervantes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433311556&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0W7", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
