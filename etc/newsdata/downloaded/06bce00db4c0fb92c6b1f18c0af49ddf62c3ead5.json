He leads a team of talented cons to steal data related to a new therapy allegedly effective for curing the rare disease from which his son suffers, but when it turns out to be a scam, he begins a campaign of revenge against them.\n\n\"I never played a con man before. I think my character is very sympathetic -- he turns into a whole new person on each episode with a new mission,\" Lee said.\n\n\"I also have a child whom I love more than anything, just like my character in the series. So I was able to completely immerse myself in the role, especially in the first two episodes, in which he desperately strives to save his son,\" Lee said.\n\nHe tied the knot with actress Jo Yoon-hee in 2017 and the couple had a daughter later that year.", "description": "Lee Dong-gun, Jeon Hye-bin in Remake of U.S. TV Series", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/26/2019102600374_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
