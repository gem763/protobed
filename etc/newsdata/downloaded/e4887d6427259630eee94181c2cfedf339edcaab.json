Right: The German Shepherd in the veterinary surgery and feeling sorry for itself after eating the light bulbs\n\nBella (pictured right and left, her x-ray left) ate seven rubber ducks and looks happy with the achievement after they were removed\n\nDespite 13 scans making the final cut, the competition winner was a peahen who ingested Cupid's arrow not long after Valentine's Day (pictured left and right)\n\nDespite 13 scans making the final cut, the competition winner was a peahen who ingested Cupid's arrow not long after Valentine's Day.\n\nJulie Burge, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, said: 'It was a few days after Valentine's Day, but her family was only concerned about why their sweet pet peahen was less active and not eating well.\n\n'Radiographs revealed she had been shot through the heart by Cupid's arrow!\n\nComing in as runners up were Nalani (right), a horse who ate her lunge whip's handle (left) and a clumsy dog who ingested a fishing pole\n\nThe other runner up was this dog (right), which decided it was a good idea to ingest a whole fishing pole (shown right in an x-ray)\n\nAva (pictured right, relaxing) ate a toy hippo (shown left in the x-ray) which gave her a spot on this year's list\n\n'A second view clarified it wasn't exactly her heart, but her ventriculus that was affected, and the arrow was a needle, which wasn't actually touching the heart-shaped charm she had also swallowed.\n\n'We removed the pendant using grasping forceps via a small incision into the junction of the proventriculus and ventriculus, but the needle could not be located, and was thought to be embedded in the thick wall of the ventriculus.\n\n'Following chelation therapy, the peahen was feeling fine, and has had no further symptoms.'\n\nHonourable mentions also went to Brodie the Labrador who ate a fork, a dog who digested 152 coins (left and right) and King the Great Dane who 'caught' a ball in his throat when playing fetch\n\nShe added: 'She is being monitored for complications in case the needle migrates and requires future exploratory surgery.'\n\nComing in as runners up were Nalani, a horse who ate her lunge whip's handle and a clumsy dog who ingested a whole fishing pole.\n\nMary Hamorski, from Veterinariae Medicinae Doctoris, said: 'Nalani was found in her stall with a 6-ft rope from a lunge whip, but no handle.\n\n'The stable hand went to feed her breakfast and after a mouthful of grain, she started choking.\n\nOne-year-old cat Pumpkin (right, sitting on a cat toy) ingested a love button and had to have it removed (left, the Pumpkin's x-ray)\n\n'He opened her mouth and saw something black at the back of it.\n\n'She was rushed to the hospital and radiographs confirmed the lunge whip's handle was in her esophagus and retrograded into her sinus - at this point, she was in respiratory distress and needed an emergency tracheostomy.\n\n'Dr Claffey was able to pull the handle through her mouth and the horse remained in the hospital for seven days and was sent home.'\n\nHonourable mentions also went to Brodie the Labrador who ate a fork, a dog who digested 152 coins and King the Great Dane who 'caught' a ball in his throat when playing fetch.\n\nDiane Streiff, DVM of VCA Elgin Family Pet Center, said: 'Brodie is a sweet six-year-old Labrador that was presented after his owner saw him eating a fork.\n\nA bearded dragon (left, in a shocking x-ray) thought it was a good idea to swallow a quarter (right, after it was removed)\n\n'He had no GI upset, and after x-rays were taken, Brodie underwent surgery to have the fork removed.\n\n'He went home afterward with no issues or regrets.'\n\nYvette Rozmarynowski, of Rugby Veterinary Service, said: 'This 16-month-old Labrador ate his owner's change from the console of his vehicle-all 152 coins, which added up to $14.13.\n\n'We all agree the owner should get a piggy bank for his coins and not use his dog.\n\n'The coins did not go toward his bill-the owner wanted to keep the change.'\n\nThis is the dog (pictured left) that decided to eat one of his favourite toys, which was 8ins long (pictured right, after it was removed)\n\nSherry Corona, DVM of Stuebner Airline Veterinary Hospital, said: 'King is a two-year-old Great Dane that was playing fetch with his owner at the park down the road from the hospital when he 'caught' an undersized ball with his throat.\n\n'Luckily, it had a narrow hole in the center, which happened to line up perfectly with his airway.\n\n'His owner rushed him in and there was some confusion as to whether or not he had actually swallowed the toy.\n\n'This radiograph confirmed the problem and he was quickly sedated.\n\n'The toy was removed manually by grasping it through the center hole and gently dislodging it from the back of the throat.\n\n'He recovered completely and his owner now only gets him large-sized toys.'", "description": "The incredible x-rays are vets' entries in Veterinary Practice News' annual 'They Ate What?' competition, which offers a prize of $500 (\u00a3405) for the most shocking item to be removed in the US.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/13/19360518-0-image-a-19_1570364055789.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
