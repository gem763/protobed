A short time later the neighbors saw the garage on fire, but they don\u2019t know if she\u2019d managed to escape, he said.\n\nRiverside County fire officials said they\u2019re still trying to determine if anybody is unaccounted for after 74 structures were decimated.\n\nPreviously authorities said they responded to \u201cnumerous\u201d medical emergencies at the park. Several residents were transported to hospitals but there were no details on their conditions, county fire Capt. Fernando Herrera said.\n\nTurner said he\u2019s been checking hospitals.\n\nFire danger is high throughout California after the typically dry summer and early fall. The high temperatures and winds predicted for inland areas of Southern California materialized mid-afternoon Thursday, when the driver of a commercial trash truck dumped a smoldering load to prevent the vehicle from catching fire.\n\nDry grass quickly ignited and winds gusting to 50 mph (80 kph) blew the fire into the Villa Calimesa Mobile Home Park, where Arvickson lived alone about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles. The park has 110 home sites and was built in 1958, according to its website. TV helicopter video showed vehicles and structures that were total losses.\n\nAbout 160 students sheltered in place as smoke enveloped nearby Mesa View Middle School before buses arrived and evacuated them to another school outside the fire zone.\n\nCrews were also battling a brush fire that prompted evacuations and closed Interstate 210 in the Sylmar neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. Several vehicles burned in a nearby industrial complex. Another blaze threatened a neighborhood in the Newbury Park area of Ventura County, west of Los Angeles.\n\nFire officials were investigating what caused the trash in the truck to catch fire in Calimesa.\n\nLinda Klosek, 70, and her daughter Stacey Holloway, 43, had gone grocery shopping and were on their way back home to Villa Calimesa when they saw their neighbors evacuating.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t even see anything, the smoke was so thick,\u201d said Linda.\n\nFrom the evacuation center they watched on TV as flames destroyed their home.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re watching it, it\u2019s like someone else\u2019s home,\u201d Stacey said. They returned $60 worth of groceries to the store because now \u201cthere\u2019s no place to put it.\u201d\n\nThe blaze, dubbed the Sandalwood Fire, was 10% percent contained Thursday night. It was one of several that broke out amid high winds and dry conditions that prompted California utilities to preemptively cut power to more than 2 million people in high-danger areas to guard against power lines sparking fires. The area that includes the mobile home park still had its power when the fire occurred.\n\nTo the west of Calimesa, firefighters contained a blaze that damaged two homes near Fontana. It was not immediately clear whether the power outage included the location where the fire broke out.\n\nIn Northern California, a brush fire sparked Thursday morning in the San Bruno Mountains south of San Francisco, prompting voluntary evacuations. No homes burned and firefighters made quick progress.", "description": "'She said she's getting her purse and she's getting out, and the line went dead'", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NlqtwHfxVfagP4xCuQlDYw--~B/aD02NTU7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/087da1b01f5d02c6b08c0c698a03d573", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
