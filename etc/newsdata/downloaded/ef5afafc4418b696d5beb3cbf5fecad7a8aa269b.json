They are also missing banned centre Rey Lee-lo and hooker Motu Matu'u, which is providing them with some further inspiration.\n\n\"The boys are hugely motivated to make the play-off (knockout stage),\" loose forward Chris Vui said when asked about whether Lee-lo and Matu'u's three-match bans for high tackles were inspiring them.\n\n\"After that Scotland game we still have belief in what we're trying to do.\n\n\"Japan's in our way but it's just another team we've got to get past to make that play-off.\"", "description": "Kotaro Matsushima crossed with the final action of the match to earn Japan a bonus point as they climbed to the top of Pool A with a battling 38-19 win against Samoa on Saturday.
