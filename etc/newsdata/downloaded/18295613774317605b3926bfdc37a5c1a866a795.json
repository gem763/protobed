The government gave MPs just hours to read hundreds of pages of technical details. One ex-minister told Business Insider the schedule was \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\nFor this reason the House of Commons refused to be rushed.\n\nRead more: Boris Johnson set for Brexit delay after MPs reject his plan to force his deal through Parliament\n\nThe vote against Johnson came thanks to the opposition of his governing partners the Democratic Unionist Party and many of the MPs who he booted out of the Conservative party last month following their rebellion on a previous vote.\n\nJohnson took his ball and ran\n\nsource Getty\n\nAfter MPs rejected his timetable, Johnson could have opted to simply bring forward a new slightly longer timetable. And indeed lots of the MPs who backed Johnson\u2019s deal implored him to do just that following the vote.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn offered to work with Johnson on reaching a compromise timetable.\n\nHowever, the prime minister insisted that he would instead \u201cpause\u201d the legislation pending a decision by the EU on whether it would delay Brexit.\n\nThis was all seemingly part of a pre-briefed plan to use any delay to his Brexit plans to force a general election.\n\nJohnson himself made this explicit earlier in the day\u2019s debate when he said that any delay would force him to \u201cgo forward to a general election.\u201d\n\nCorbyn under pressure to allow a Christmas election\n\nsource UK Parliament\n\nImmediately after the vote Johnson\u2019s Conservative party released new campaign material blaming the opposition Labour Party for the delay to passing his Brexit deal.\n\nThe message was clear: the only reason Brexit isn\u2019t happening is because of Corbyn and his party.\n\n#BREAKING: @BorisJohnson's Brexit deal has passed Parliament tonight. But now Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have voted to delay it, yet again.

Had he decided to accept a short delay, he would likely have been able to press ahead and succeed in passing Brexit, in some form, by the end of the year.\n\nHowever, the abiding aim of Johnson\u2019s administration since its inception in July has been to force a general election in order to restore a parliamentary majority for his government.\n\nEverything else has come second to that, including Brexit.\n\nJohnson\u2019s previous attempts to force a general election were rejected by Labour and other opposition parties as they feared he would use any election period to force the UK out of the EU without a deal.\n\nHowever, now that a third delay to Brexit looks all but inevitable, he prime minister believes he will be able to force Corbyn into accepting an election this year.\n\nIt is this, rather than any timetabling issues that was behind the prime minister\u2019s decision to withdraw his Brexit bill last night.\n\nWill Brexit still happen?\n\nThere is now a clear, if fragile, majority in the House of Commons for leaving the EU. However, the terms of that exit remain unclear and it appears that the current parliament wants a much softer form of Brexit than that wanted by either Johnson or his party.\n\nFor that reason, the prime minister would apparently rather wait until after securing a majority in parliament before pushing ahead with Brexit.\n\nSecuring that majority is not a given, however. Johnson has a comfortable lead in recent opinion polls, but his predecessor May had an even bigger lead before going into the 2017 general election and still managed to end up neck and neck with Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party by the end of the campaign.\n\nJohnson is a much more effective campaigner than May however and he remains the favourite to win any Christmas election.\n\nIf he were to be successful in securing a majority for his government then it is clear that there would be a majority in parliament for Brexit. If and when that happens, then the UK\u2019s exit from the EU would almost certainly finally happen.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the end of the Brexit story\n\nsource Getty\n\nEven if those series of events were to take place, that would not be the end of the Brexit process. Britain would then immediately enter a 12-month period of transition before a new Brexit cliff edge of December 2020. During this time, the UK would continue to operate under EU laws and regulations and would also need to negotiate the terms of its future relationship with the bloc before leaving entirely at the end of the year.\n\nMost experts believe that 12 months is nowhere near long enough to negotiate a new free trade agreement with the EU. Such agreements normally take years and the political climate in the UK remains hostile to a rapid agreement.\n\nFor this reason, whatever happens, Britain\u2019s seemingly never-ending Brexit saga is set to drag on for some time yet.\n\nRead more: The EU moves to delay Brexit until next year after Boris Johnson abandons bid to force his deal through Parliament", "description": "Business Insider - Boris Johnson's Brexit deal passed its first stage in the UK parliament on Tuesday but was quickly shelved by the prime minister.
