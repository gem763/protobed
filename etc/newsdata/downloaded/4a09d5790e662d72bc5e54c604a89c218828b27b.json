She won the 2019 ANSTO Eureka Prize for Innovative Use of Technology. Her team of student, PhD and postgraduate researchers, and academic staff work from new $11 million labs which house 3D printers that can work on macro- and microscopic scales.\n\nThe team has created tendons and ligaments using a polymer material (they could be in use within five years, Zreiqat says, with various caveats) and have plans for cartilage, and even newly grown teeth. On a higher scale again, there is the creation of complete replacement organs. That\u2019s a holy grail that many labs around the world are striving towards, and which Silicon Valley sees as a vast potential source of income.\n\nI don\u2019t like to pre-empt things and affect the results. But all the results we have done so far are good. \u2014 Professor Hala Zreiqat\n\nZreiqat and her team are at the \u201corganoid\u201d stage. She is reluctant to talk about this, cautious of raising unreasonable expectations, but sends a follow-up email with more details.\n\n\u201cWe are now developing our 3D printing technology to broader applications,\u201d it reads.\n\n\u201cWe can print other tissues using the 3D printing to reconstruct human organs. This is at an early stage as we combine cell and matrix constructs designed to stimulate organ development similar to what would occur in the developing embryo. At the moment we, like others, can use human stem cells and direct their differentiation in the dish into multiple cell types. We are advancing sciences by developing a 3D defined structure. This is currently in few-millimetre dimensions but the promise is there to upscale this for whole organ manufacturing in the future.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the bone scaffolding uses no biological products. Part of the secret is to add other ingredients \u2013 including silicon, calcium, strontium and zinc \u2013 into the \u201csoup\u201d used by the 3D printer. \u201cThese are in a very minute amount \u2026 but enough to induce this action without, and I need to stress this, any added cells or growth factors, which is of significance because you avoid the hurdles of regulatory approval, safety problems, ethical issues where you take bones from another patient.\u201d\n\nProfessor Hala Zreiqat with one of her team at the Tissue Engineering and Biomaterials Research Unit. Wolter Peeters\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs she confident in the French trials? \u201cYou can never be confident in research and I don\u2019t like to be biased. I don\u2019t like to pre-empt things and affect the results. But all the results we have done so far are good.\u201d\n\nShe shows me a scale model of a hip, then a jaw. \u201cThere is no limit, next we are going to do the complete mandible.\u201d\n\nThe jawbone is complex and challenging, she says, but cancer victims currently have them replaced with metal, which was never designed to be in human bodies. \u201cIt does not integrate with bone and can be encapsulated by fibrous tissue, resulting in their migration and structural failure.\u201d\n\nSo where does the displaced ceramic go? \u201cA good question. It is excreted through normal physiological processes.\u201d\n\nTrapped in the army\n\nAlthough born in Jordan, Zreiqat\u2019s father started a business in Bethlehem soon after, and the family moved to the West Bank. She says she grew up with the Israeli occupation mainly in the background. \u201cI considered myself the luckiest person. I had the best upbringing in Bethlehem, it was beautiful.\u201d\n\nShe went to German and French schools, learnt English as well, and spoke Arabic at home. \u201cWhen we would go to Jerusalem to meet very close Jewish friends \u2013 we use to call them Uncle and Auntie \u2013 on a Sunday afternoon, the military would ask everyone to step out of the car except my father. He had crystal blue eyes and blond hair and they thought he wasn\u2019t Arabic.\u201d\n\nShe says she found herself far less free when she moved back \u201chome\u201d to enrol at the University of Jordan in Amman. \u201cI hated the restraints, I hated Jordan.\u201d She had won a scholarship to study biology, but it came with a commission in the Jordanian Armed Forces. After graduation she worked at the flagship King Hussein Medical Centre as a scientific officer, in military greens, eventually running a cardiac diagnostic lab. Officially she was a first lieutenant, and even completed a combat course. \u201cI shot and I won,\u201d she laughs. She laughs a lot these days, but was desperately unhappy back then.\n\nThe team has created team has created tendons and ligaments using a polymer material and have plans for cartilage and even teeth. Wolter Peeters\n\nHer father saw that, and paid $50,000 to buy her commission out of the Jordanian army, an extraordinary amount at the time. It was 1991, she was 30, and decided to move to Australia, about which she knew almost nothing. After the sacrifices of her parents, and the pain of leaving everyone behind, she resolved: \u201cFrom the minute the plane touches the ground in Australia it\u2019s going to be smiling and looking ahead all the way through.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Extremely hard' to make it as a woman\n\nIt has been, she says, even though \u201cnobody in Australia could pronounce Zreiqat\u201d and there was plenty of culture shock (two examples: people in Australia endlessly chatted about their weekends, and became angry if a bus was two minutes late. She thought: \u201cWhich planet do these people come from?\u201d)\n\nThe first jobs she was offered were less challenging than the one left behind. She knocked on the doors of universities instead, thinking, \u201cI want to do research, I want to do something different, that I couldn\u2019t do in Jordan.\u201d\n\nShe found a mentor at the University of NSW immunology department, worked there, completed a PhD, then secured a large research grant. It allowed her to pursue the scaffolding, an idea that came to her while working on her doctorate. With a later Australian Research Council grant she moved to The University of Sydney and began recruiting people from around the world.\n\nIf you give them security, the sky\u2019s the limit with the calibre of people I have. \u2014 Professor Hala Zreiqat\n\nZreiqat describes her main motivation as to not to have anybody suffering with things that can be fixed. Her international team is the thing she\u2019s most attached to, and makes working 11- or 12-hour days, Monday to Sunday, worthwhile (\u201cDo I ever take a holiday? I haven\u2019t taken a holiday since 2007\u201d).\n\n\u201cWhat really makes it exciting and worthwhile to me is to work with the young people I have at the honours, at the undergraduate level, at the PhD, at the postdoc level. My hope is to have enough funds to keep them going, to give them security. If you give them security, the sky\u2019s the limit with the calibre of people I have.\u201d\n\nSo has Australia given her everything she needs and hopes for? Yes and no. She believes this country needs to create the right environment for early career researchers, so that our brightest young people don\u2019t leave. Sure, they need to be funded to see the world and learn what is being done elsewhere, but we need to give them the mechanism to come back so we don\u2019t lose them.\n\nAnd on a personal level? Although she won the 2018 NSW Premier\u2019s Award for Woman of the Year, Zreiqat becomes quite emotional when she says: \u201cI found it extremely hard to carve my way through as a woman. Still do. Your accomplishments, which happen to be quite a lot in the past two years, are diminished because you are a woman.\n\n\u201cNevertheless I wouldn\u2019t change it, [Australia\u2019s] what made my life what it is right now.\u201d", "description": "She grew up in the occupied West Bank and was a lieutenant in the Jordanian army, but Hala Zreiqat is now a star of Australian biomedical innovation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.599%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1006%2C$y_107/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/64efaa1bd868f42418f22c048116a2760bd20dcf", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
