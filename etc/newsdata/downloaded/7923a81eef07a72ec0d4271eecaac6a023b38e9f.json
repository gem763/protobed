Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., listens as Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Russell Vought testifies before the House Budget Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 12, 2019, during a hearing on the fiscal year 2020 budget. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nIlhan Omar is not a nice person.\n\nThat\u2019s become abundantly clear given the behavior that\u2019s been revealed over the last several months. We\u2019ve known about her history of corruption and back biting for some time, including strong evidence she married her brother to commit immigration fraud, but her current marriage was thrust into the spotlight most recently. We found out that she was cheating on Ahmed Hirsi with a campaign consultant who she just happened to be shoveling hundreds of thousands of dollars to in campaign funds as well. While an investigation would need to take place, it sure looks like she was funding his travel and business expenses in order to facilitate her affair.\n\nBut if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, a new report is out providing evidence that she not only cheated on Hirsi, she then, in all her vindictiveness, got him fired from his job.\n\nThis via PJ Media.\n\nDuring the summer, sources* within the Minneapolis Somali community informed me that Rep. Ilhan Omar has been using financial leverage to prevent Ahmed Hirsi from filing for divorce. Ahmed Hirsi\u2019s employment with Councilwoman Cano was quietly terminated months ago: June 14. The June 14 termination of Ahmed Hirsi\u2019s employment is public data. Anyone can verify this information by filing a request with the City of Minneapolis City Clerk. My sources stated that Ahmed Hirsi was terminated following a request by Rep. Omar. They added that Omar\u2019s motivation for the request was to force Hirsi to become reliant upon her assets and income. For the majority of 2019, Ahmed Hirsi has reportedly borne the responsibility of raising the three children he has with Omar. (One source used the term \u201cabandoned\u201d to describe Ilhan\u2019s recent share of the parenting.) Since June 14, Hirsi does not appear to have a reliable source of income. Meanwhile, Rep. Omar currently draws a $174,000 Congressional salary, and reportedly received a $250,000 book advance in January.\n\nFirst she cheats on Hirsi and lies about it. The media, being the hacks they are, dutifully accept her denials and ask no further questions. Then irrefutable evidence emerges in the form of a divorce complaint that she did in fact commit adultery. Given all that, you\u2019d think perhaps she\u2019d at least have some sympathy on her husband and not try to ruin his life. Nah, she dumps the kids in his lap and gets him fired from his job because that\u2019s apparently the kind of person she is.\n\nOmar seems like a joy, doesn\u2019t she?\n\nIt absolutely amazes me that all of this, including the initial affair, aren\u2019t front page on every newspaper in this country. Can you imagine if this were a Republican having an affair in office and behaved this way? Would CNN cover it? Would they have a dozen reporters digging into every detail? Of course they would. But because it is Omar, she can basically act like a mob boss and no one but right wing news outlets bat an eye. This is a woman who threatened Hirsi in order to stop him from filing for divorce. Just this week, she was caught deleting tweets that revealed her father\u2019s real name, corroborating accounts she committed marriage fraud.\n\nThis is not someone that should be in Congress. The fact that Democrats continue to baby her and protect her says nothing good about them. If this is the future of the Democratic party, the Democratic party can\u2019t be allowed to retake power.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
