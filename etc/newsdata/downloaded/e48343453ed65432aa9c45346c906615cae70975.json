The two countries\u2019 approaches to regulating fintech, which in many ways reflect enduring national stereotypes, almost certainly have contributed to our continent\u2019s fintech lag.\n\nCanada tends to favour large but stable financial institutions and Canadian regulation has generally helped preserve this status quo. At the same time, there is undeniable interest in fostering fintech, and helpful steps have been taken, the Canadian Securities Administrators\u2019 (CSA) fintech \u201cregulatory sandbox\u201d being a notable example.\n\nBut our lawmakers are cautious, slow to adapt, and reluctant to experiment, and we don\u2019t have the vibrant startup funding ecosystem the U.S. does. On the other hand, what the U.S. gains in fintech competition, regulatory experimentation, and more venture capital, it tends to lose from the costs of regulatory fragmentation and complexity.\n\nEven so, and despite scoring lower on the EY scale, the U.S. has at least a slight edge in competition, which may pay off over time, given that country\u2019s historically more aggressive approach to legislative change \u2014even if, in the current U.S. political climate, legislation on anything seems unlikely.\n\nThe need for fintech regulation is evident. Crypto-asset trading platforms are a recurring haven for hacks. The QuadrigaCX scandal, in which over $200 million of cryptocurrency and cash went missing when founder Gerald Cotten died with sole access to the platform\u2019s cryptocurrency wallets and private keys, highlights the dangers of lax oversight.\n\nFintech can expose customer data, increase systemic risk, create moral hazard in peer-to-peer lending, and drive investor herds with robo-advisers. Money laundering is also a higher risk in virtual currency. FinCEN (a bureau of the U.S. Treasury) and FINTRAC (Canada\u2019s money-laundering overseer) have both issued detailed guidance, with new FINTRAC regulations coming into force next year. Looming ominously is Facebook\u2019s Libra, which if embraced on a global scale could upend sovereign control of monetary policy.\n\nBut while fintech regulation is clearly needed, too much of it may restrict consumer-friendly innovation. The U.S. has a long history of fostering competition in banking. Its \u201cdual\u201d state and federal banking systems drive competition, and now technology firms can also become banks. Last summer the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) launched a \u201cspecial purpose\u201d fintech national banking charter, endorsed by Treasury.\n\nThe charter has been criticized (and litigated) by state regulators as exceeding the OCC\u2019s legal authority, and some tech firms may ultimately decide that the costs of enhanced supervision exceed the charter\u2019s benefits. But it represents a strong policy signal that the U.S. is open for business and willing to experiment with non-traditional banking to increase innovation and benefit consumers. Arizona and Wyoming have passed accommodating fintech legislation while the federal government\u2019s Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have both created innovation initiatives. Changes are now being sought in Congress to provide clarity in regulating digital tokens.\n\nCanada lacks a special purpose vehicle like the OCC\u2019s. Despite numerous government consultations, fintech-related legislative changes have been rare and slow-moving, and some proposed rules \u2014 like the CSA / IIROC framework for crypto-asset trading platforms \u2014 may increase regulatory costs rather than reduce entry barriers.\n\nBanks in Canada integrate fintech internally in competition with other major banks. The Competition Bureau has noted progress in adjusting regulations limiting \u201caccess to core infrastructure and services\u201d and governing \u201cde-risking\u201d of major banks as entry barriers for new fintech firms, but more can be done. Competition could increase if the Department of Finance were to accelerate its recent review of \u201copen banking\u201d \u2014 a concept already adopted in Europe that gives customers greater control over and portability of their banking data, in particular for disclosure to fintechs.\n\nDespite its pro-competitive bias, U.S. fintech adoption is hampered by a highly fragmented and complex web of federal and state agency supervision. Navigating this maze is very costly for new firms. This is less of a problem in Canada since most financial transactions happen at federally regulated banks under integrated OSFI oversight.\n\nOur lawmakers are cautious, slow to adapt, and reluctant to experiment, and we don't have the vibrant startup funding ecosystem the U.S. does\n\nA harmonizing bright spot is the CSA fintech \u201csandbox,\u201d which created a national \u201ctesting space\u201d for firms to operate with regulatory relief under bespoke supervision. The CSA sandbox has helped launch, among other initiatives, ZED Network\u2019s blockchain-based \u201cforeign exchange remittance network system,\u201d and Token Funder\u2019s platform for issuing \u201ctokenized\u201d securities. A national sandbox doesn\u2019t yet exist in the U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has said she doesn\u2019t want regulators \u201csitting\u201d next to entrepreneurs as they \u201cgrab hold of the shovels and buckets.\u201d So far in Canada, regulatory meddling in entrepreneurial decisions seems not to have been a problem, although it would be nice to have more sandbox participants.\n\nCanada\u2019s financial strength \u2014 stability \u2014 is also its weakness as a launching pad for disruptive tech. Maintaining financial system stability is important, but unless Canada can increase competition in its financial services sector it runs a real risk of falling further behind in the fintech world. Keeping up will require more experimentation in regulation.\n\nRyan Clements is an assistant professor at the University of Calgary Faculty of Law and consultant to the Alberta Securities Commission (ASC).
