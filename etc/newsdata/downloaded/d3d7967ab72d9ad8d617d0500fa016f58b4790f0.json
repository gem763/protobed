Growers in Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Russia, and other nations are rushing to replace US suppliers of soy, beef, wheat, and other foodstuffs affected by retaliatory tariffs from the US\u2019s trading partners.\n\nAt the same time, the US\u2019s withdrawal from previous trade treaties\u2014together with the difficulty it has had in concluding new, comprehensive agreements\u2014has put the nation\u2019s agribusinesses at a big competitive disadvantage in key markets. After the US pulled out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in 2017, for example, the other member states struck a new deal among themselves that will give major food exporters such as Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand privileged access in Japan, a critical US market. And while US negotiations with the EU over a new free-trade pact have crawled along, Canada and Mercosur\u2014\u00ada group of Latin American nations that includes Brazil and Argentina\u2014have concluded agreements with the EU to give their suppliers an edge over US exporters in that important market.\n\nThe longer the trade wars drag on and the uncertainty over US trade policy persists, the more time rivals will have to build the production capacity, distribution infrastructure, and deep-rooted relationships with importers they will need to erode the competitive advantage that US suppliers have built over decades.\n\nOf course, supply relationships in the food trade are not made and broken overnight. It takes years for importers to trust that a foreign crop and protein processor can deliver products on time, even during poor harvests, and that its goods will meet their country\u2019s quality and regulatory standards. In addition, particularly with regard to fresh, ready-to-consume foods such as meats and produce, suppliers often provide logistical and other support that would be costly for an importer to handle on its own. As a result, diversifying to other suppliers or switching to another source entirely can carry substantial risk and cost.\n\nThe threat that US agribusinesses will permanently lose foreign market share is not merely theoretical. In previous trade scuffles, such as one with China involving beef, the US has not regained lost share. By making US crops and foodstuffs more expensive than alternatives, high tariffs lower the cost to importers of diversification. And the less faith importers have in the US as a stable supplier, in view of the potential for future trade conflicts, the more necessary it becomes for them to hedge and further diversify. Over time, importers could completely unwind complex relationships with US suppliers.", "description": "The longer the nation\u2019s many trade disputes drag on, the greater the risk to US farmers that they won\u2019t be able to regain lost share in China and other critical markets.", "authors": ["Decker Walker", "Michael Mcadoo", "Matt Westerlund", "Iacob Koch-Weser", "Lauren Mcgraw", "Marc Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://boston-consulting-group-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/w_1125,q_auto,f_auto/http://image-src.bcg.com/Images/US-Agribusiness-Rectangular_tcm-231256.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
