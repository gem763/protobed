Watch this.\n\nIslam isn\u2019t particularly known for its fairness to women. In fact, it\u2019s well known to be a society that treats them a second class and below, forbidding them to learn basic things such as reading and math. They\u2019re used more like servants and breeding stock in many Islam dominated countries and are punished severely for violating any of the strict Sharia laws set for them.\n\nThis is a fact that is typically overlooked by a lot of the left, especially feminists. When it comes to Islam\u2019s treatment of women, you\u2019ll find many a blind eye among the social justice warriors who often go so far as to defend Islam as the \u201creligion of peace\u201d the left claims it is.\n\nSo when flyers began going up around Winchester, Massachusetts, that stated \u201cIslam is right about women,\u201d the outrage was present, but nobody wanted to say why.\n\nAccording to WHDH-TV a woman discovered the flyers around the town and became \u201cfearful.\u201d She immediately took them down where she found them and alerted police, who then found five more around the town. Most interestingly is how the report was framed:\n\nAnita Davison told 7NEWS that she was walking her child to school on Wednesday when saw the concerning flyers struck to street signs near the town\u2019s center. Davison says she was alarmed by the sight of the flyers and immediately ripped them down. \u201cPolitical climate at the moment, and all the things happening around the world, it just puts a little fear in you,\u201d she said. After Davison brought two flyers to the Winchester Police Department, officers went out and found eight more, including one that was posted outside of an elementary school. Some residents say they think the signs refer to strict laws applied to women.\n\n\u201cSome residents say they think,\u201d says the report.\n\nThe police of Winchester even called the flyers \u201cnot of a threatening nature,\u201d which, if you\u2019re a woman, would likely be a statement you\u2019d disagree with. I also found it interesting that the station decided to include that little factoid.\n\nThe entire reason this is a story in the first place is that everyone knows exactly what the message entails and that the fear it inspires in women is legitimate. Even so, the media doesn\u2019t want to go into these strict laws or where they originate from despite the subject being right in the flyer they\u2019re reporting on.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if an Islamic faithful posted these, or if it\u2019s a clever attempt at someone forcing people to face an inconvenient reality. Either way, the conversation is worth having.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s worth honestly reporting about.", "description": "Flyers Stating \u201cIslam Is Right About Women\u201d Causes Media to Have a Narrative Crisis", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Nick Arama", "Alex Parker", "Sarah Lee", "Sister Toldjah", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-20-at-1.24.38-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
