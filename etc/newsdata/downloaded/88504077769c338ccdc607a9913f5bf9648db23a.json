Add Interest\n\nParscale told ABC News that the contractor, called Red State Data and Digital, LLC, was not a secret and that the firm complied completely with election laws and was primarily working to support congressional candidates during the 2018 midterms.\n\n\u201cComplaints about Red State are simply another attempt to smear President Trump by attacking those who work for him,\u201d Parscale said.\n\nJust last week, the Trump campaign objected angrily to a tabloid news report indicating Parscale was using the spoils of his political work to purchase millions of dollars in real estate and luxury cars. The campaign said Parscale\u2019s wealth began to accrue from work that predated the launch of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential bid.\n\n\u201cBrad makes no secret of his past business success,\u201d campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh told ABC News last week. \u201cSince 2016 he has sold three start-up companies: Parscale Media, Giles-Parscale, and a medical device company. He sold all these to focus full time on the President\u2019s re-election.\u201d\n\nParscale has not previously discussed his interest in the firm Red State Data and Digital, LLC, which began doing website development and digital fundraising work for America First Action, Inc., in March 2018, just weeks after Parscale took the job of campaign manager for Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters, FILE\n\nSince then, the pro-Trump super PAC has paid Red State $909,871, according to campaign finance records. Much of that money was spent in support of midterm congressional candidates ahead of the November 2018 elections, the records show.\n\nA public indication of his connection to the firm surfaced on corporate documents in Delaware, which can only be accessed from a state registrar\u2019s office in Dover. The records showed that Candice Parscale signed a form submitted to change the name of the company\u2019s registered owner. The filing appeared on the state registry just two weeks ago, and does not say what specific position Candice Parscale holds in the company.\n\nBrad Parscale confirmed the firm is an offshoot of Parscale Strategy LLC after ABC News contacted him. He said his wife has long served as a bookkeeper for his businesses.\n\n\"Red State is a valued vendor that provides us with digital consulting services at a competitive rate,\" America First Action spokesperson Kelly Sadler told ABC News. \"America First strictly complies with FEC rules and regulations and any suggestion otherwise is patently false.\"\n\nRed State was set up to be a \u201cfirewall company\u201d -- a legal maneuver that allowed it to continue working for the America First super PAC during the mid-term elections, without risking a violation of election rules that prohibit any coordination between a campaign and a like-minded super PAC, Parscale said. Election law experts said that type of arrangement is not new.\n\n\u201cFirewalls are common within the political consulting and polling industries,\u201d Jan Baran, a Republican election lawyer, told ABC News. \u201cThe firewalls are a compliance measure that prevents illegal coordination with campaigns and political parties.\u201d\n\nCampaigns are supposed to assiduously avoid coordinating their messages and spending with political action committees, a legal requirement put in place to prevent the committees from being used as shadow campaigns operating without strict donation limits. Parscale said he was conscious of those rules when he created Red State to take over work that Parscale Strategy had been doing for the pro-Trump super PAC.\n\n\u201cThis is a perfectly legal and appropriate arrangement, which is firewalled, with zero chance for coordination,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could not possibly be coordination because the ads placed were for other candidates in the 2018 midterms.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petalas, a former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission who is now in private practice, said the arrangement ultimately depends on how carefully Parscale and those working at America First Action observe the firewall. Parscale cannot talk with his counterparts at the super PAC about polling, or potent messages, or geographic targeting, he said, because doing so would cross that firewall.\n\n\u201cIt strikes me that this is a highly risky strategy,\u201d Petalas said.\n\nABC News reporter Meg Cunningham contributed to this report.", "description": "A digital data firm connected to President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager has received more than $900,000 in business from a pro-Trump super PAC.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/brad-parscale-01-rtr-jc-190822_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
