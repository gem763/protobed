Aftercovering up the death of Rana Habeeb, Gary went on to kill Rick Neelan and take over his shady loan sharking business and appeared to have a whale of a time beating up Ryan Connor (Ryan Prescott).\n\nAnd now it seems to be Ali Neeson (James Burrows) who should be watching his back as Gary moves in for the kill. Despite only having shown a romantic interest in Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon) for the best part of a week, territorial Gary is soon throwing his weight around and deciding to get the struggling doctor out of the picture when he realises Ali still holds a torch for his ex.\n\nMaria was left heartbroken when Ali dumped her while struggling with his painkiller addiction and it was Gary who was there as a shoulder for her to cry on. When Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) overhears Ali telling Maria that he wished he had never dumped her and wants to give their relationship another try, he can\u2019t resist turning the knife in with his nemesis.\n\nBut he is inadvertently putting Ali in serious danger as Gary simmers with rage and then hits up the private detective whose loyalties he turned to do some digging on Ali. Viewers know that with his painkiller addiction and the death of Ronan, Ali has a few skeletons that he would prefer weren\u2019t unearthed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what is Gary going to find out \u2013 and how far is he willing to go in order to stop Ali from winning Maria back?\n\nBefore long, Gary has made a breakthrough in his hunt for Dr Ali dirt when he learns that Dr Gaddas reported Ali recently. Learning that he has been missing shifts and has been behaving erratically amid the investigation, Gary is intrigued to learn that someone who works at the hospital has been caught selling painkillers and prescription drugs.\n\nGary takes drastic action and issues threats to the drug dealer, wanting as much information as he can get on Ali. After a warning to take Gary seriously from Ryan, Ali later heads round to the furniture shop and finds Gary\u2019s ledger.\n\nAs Gary calls round and thinks he has the upper hand on Ali, the doctor turns the tables and confronts him over operating as a loan shark.\n\nWill Gary be forced to silence him?\n\nOne to watch: Friday 8th November at 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Gary lashes out in Corrie.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/07_11_coro_gary_shop_02_0-8869_1571659288.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
