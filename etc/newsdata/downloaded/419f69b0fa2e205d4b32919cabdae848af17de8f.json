The Falcons are off to a 1-4 start for the second straight season and showing no signs of improvement. They\u2019ve gotten worse during each week of a three-game losing streak.\n\nQuinn\u2019s job security is another issue. He is 19-21 since winning the NFC three years ago and with the final say in personnel matters, he is most responsible for this mess.\n\nHe indicated on a conference call with reporters Monday night that there are no immediate plans to have another coach run the defense. Quinn fired all three coordinators after last season and oversees the defense himself.\n\n\u201cMy ego is never as big as the team,\u201d he said. \u201cI will always do what is best for that, but at this time I don\u2019t think that\u2019s where I\u2019m at.\u201d\n\nMaybe Sunday\u2019s 53-32 loss to the Texans will be the low point. Perhaps Atlanta will learn how to establish a running game despite Devonta Freeman ranking 40th in the league and stop somebody after getting gouged for 592 yards and managing one quarterback hit.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to imagine the Falcons pulling off a miracle similar to what Indianapolis did last year, turning a 1-5 start into a wild-card berth. Quinn and the players keep saying effort is not an issue, that practice is going well, but each loss is only more evidence the season is going nowhere.\n\nLast year the Falcons won three straight in October against the Buccaneers, Giants and Redskins, but they face a more difficult task this time. After facing the 1-3-1 Cardinals, Atlanta\u2019s next four opponents - the Rams, Seahawks, Saints and Panthers - are a combined 14-6.\n\n\u201cAll the focus has to be on Arizona, and you\u2019ve got to start rolling on it because there\u2019s plenty of good stories of what it can be if you get going,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, man, you better get going and not wait.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nMatt Ryan, who connected with eight receivers, leads the league in completions and is second in yards passing, but those are mostly empty numbers. The Falcons keep falling behind and have to throw the ball repeatedly to try and catch up.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThird-down defense, same as last year, and pressure on the quarterback. The Falcons are giving up 56% to rank third-worst on third downs, seven points worse than they were to rank last in 2018. They\u2019ve had no sacks the last two weeks and a total of five that\u2019s tied for fewest in the league.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nAustin Hooper leads the team with 34 catches and 343 yards receiving, good for the fourth-year tight end but not so good for an offense that needs to get the ball more often in the hands of star wideout Julio Jones. Opponents are bottling up Jones too often with double teams and safety help.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nMatt Wile, signed for the second time this year to fill in for injured Matt Bosher, had two kickoffs sail out of bounds to let Houston start at its 40-yard line. Both drives ended in points. And Freeman, three years removed from being made the NFL\u2019s highest-paid running back, leads a thin ground game that\u2019s averaging just 67.6 yards.\n\nINJURED\n\nDefensive back Damontae Kazee suffered a head injury in the third quarter and did not return.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\nMinus-50 - Atlanta\u2019s points differential, which ranks second worst in the NFC.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nStruggling teams always say they have the right people in house to make corrections. The Falcons are no different, but the words are starting to ring hollow.\n\n\u201cI told the team this past week wins don\u2019t happen by accident, and you\u2019ve got to earn them, and you\u2019ve got to do right in how we\u2019re doing,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t, those are the results. So that\u2019s the intent of focus. If we have to do less to get it right, we will. But no doubt, backs against the wall and gut-check time for us, but all across the board disappointed in our performance.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Atlanta Falcons can only hope a few days in the desert will turn their season around.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/falcons_texans_football_17198_c0-533-1482-1397_s1770x1032.jpg?2f2183208305b3255f7817a66a822ffcf91fd55b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
