Already there is talk of those two fights being a prelude to Fury meeting the winner next - and he has begun calling out Velasquez.\n\n\u2018Who knows what lies beneath?\u2019 says Fury. \u2018Maybe Velasquez, maybe Lesnar.\u2019\n\nIf so, his combined purses from the two WWE fights would come close to the $50million he stands to accumulate from what Sportsmail now understand to be not one but two contracted rematches to complete a classic trilogy with Wilder \u2013 February in Vegas and Wembley Stadium next summer.\n\nWilder, who himself still has to come through his other rematch against Luis Ortiz unscathed on November 23, will not be surprised if Fury pulls out of their engagement. The second fight was delayed from this summer when Fury suddenly signed an $80m (\u00a363m) US television contract with ESPN which included two warm-up fights in America.\n\nNow Wilder, the WBC world champion who insists he was robbed of KO victory by Fury being \u2018given the benefit of a long count\u2019 last December, says of that brutal last round knock- down: \u2018Tyson was unconscious and has no memory of going down or getting up. That\u2019s heavy, man, and I know his family don\u2019t want him to risk fighting me again.\u2019\n\nIf the return does fall by the wayside, the Bronze Bomber will seek to meet the winner of Anthony Joshua\u2019s December rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr, also in Riyadh, to find the first undisputed world heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis.\n\nRuiz pulled off the upset of the century when he ripped all the other belts from Joshua in New York and Wilder expects him to repeat that shock knockout, saying: \u2018I respect AJ but Andy\u2019s got his number.\u2019\n\nFury (left) and Wilder drew in their initial classic fight in 2018 and are scheduled to meet again\n\nA suspicion that Ruiz may have \u2018lost focus\u2019 during his hectic celebration of becoming Mexico\u2019s first world heavyweight champion has been dispelled by the publication of training camp pictures showing him dramatically trimmed down from \u2018this fat boy who loves Snickers,\u2019 along with him saying: \u2018I\u2019m a lot slimmer, even faster and punching with even more power.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, other indicators show Fury veering towards pro wrestling. At the media launch for the Strowman fight he revealed how seriously he is taking the switch by revealing: \u2018I\u2019ve been training at the WWE facility in Orlando.\n\n'I was supposed to be resting while the eye mended but I\u2019m excited about 385lbs of Braun coming at me. Yeah, me against Wilder is the biggest fight in boxing but I\u2019m not thinking about that now. I\u2019m just enjoying my life \u2013 and concentrating on WWE.\u2019\n\nFurthermore, Frank Warren was not told before that announcement and Fury\u2019s boxing promoter says: \u2018I\u2019m not in favour of this and it does put the Wilder fight in jeopardy. But he\u2019s a grown man who makes his own decisions. I hope it\u2019s more a show than a fight.\u2019\n\nFury - who was given medical advice to avoid all physical exercise for at least six weeks after Otto Wallin cut his on June 15 and told not spar until Christmas - paints a different picture: \u2018People say that WWE is a fake but now I know the hard reality. It\u2019s the most physically taxing sport I\u2019ve ever been involved in.\n\nFury is still unbeaten, and recently turned his hand to WWE in his break between fights\n\n'My first days of training opened my eyes to how athletic these guys really are. There\u2019s always going to be injuries in a contact sport but I\u2019m not worried. I\u2019m a born prize-fighter who\u2019s been fighting his whole life.\u2019\n\nHe is also a long-time WWE enthusiast and his eldest son is an avid follower. Two more reasons for making a move which will dismay boxing and its fans. As for WWE, the financial investment of luring boxing\u2019s lineal world heavyweight champion is weighed against the need to reverse something of a fall in TV audiences.\n\nHence, also, that organisation\u2019s continuing expansion into oil-rich Saudia Arabia. Like Joshua, who is under fire from human rights campaigners for taking the Ruiz fight there, Fury can expect criticism for following suit.\n\nTo which he says: \u2018I\u2019m not a politician. I\u2019m a fighting man from a fighting gypsy family and I go where I\u2019m paid to fight.\u2019\n\nIn another twist to the tale, Fury\u2019s fight with Strowman will be televised live on Sky Sports Box Office, even though he is contracted to box on BT Sport in this country as well as ESPN in the US.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY JEFF POWELL: Tyson Fury's rematch of his epic world heavyweight title draw with Deontay Wilder is in serious doubt as he banks $15M (\u00a311.9m) for his WWE debut this month.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/19/19690896-0-image-a-4_1571078223654.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
