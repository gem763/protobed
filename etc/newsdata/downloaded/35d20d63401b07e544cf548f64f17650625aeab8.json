Cory A. Booker on Tuesday unveiled a $3 trillion plan to combat climate change with a goal of building a \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d economy by 2045.\n\nThe plan includes a $1.5 trillion investment in clean energy, energy storage and electric vehicles by 2030 and $400 billion for research and development by 2030, among other priorities.\n\n\u201cWe are facing a dual crisis of climate change and economic inequality,\u201d said Mr. Booker, a 2020 presidential candidate. \u201cWithout immediate action, we risk an incredible human toll from disasters, health impacts, rising national security threats, and trillions of dollars in economic losses.\u201d\n\nMr. Booker\u2019s campaign said the plan includes \u201cthe most sweeping investment to advance environmental justice in history,\u201d as he and other 2020 contenders jockey for position on who has the most far-reaching plan to tackle climate change \u2014 an issue that\u2019s taken center stage in the race for the White House.\n\nHis plan calls for an \u201cenvironmental justice fund\u201d seeded with $50 billion per year that would go toward helping communities replace lead drinking water service lines, cleaning up abandoned coal mines and planting 100 million trees in urban areas by 2030, among other priorities.\n\nAuthorities say they\u2019ve found elevated lead levels in the water supply in Newark, New Jersey, where Mr. Booker was mayor from 2006-2013, and have tied the problem to leaching in the pipe system.\n\nThe senator\u2019s plan would also require \u201cresponsible\u201d paint companies to pay for cleanup caused by lead paint.\n\nHis new plan would also impose a carbon fee on fossil fuel sources, with some of the money raised going toward helping offset increased energy costs for low-to-middle income households.\n\nMr. Booker\u2019s campaign said that even if Congress doesn\u2019t act, he would take executive action to increase federal enforcement actions against polluting companies, reinstate vehicle emissions standards the Trump administration has moved to change and stop giving waivers to \u201cbig oil\u201d companies to help them get around the Renewable Fuel Standard.\n\nMr. Booker would also push to end fossil fuel subsidies, ban all new onshore or offshore fossil fuel leases, and phase out fracking.\n\nThe senator announced the plan as he and nine other 2020 presidential contenders prepare to participate in a \u201cclimate crisis\u201d town hall event hosted by CNN on Wednesday in New York.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
