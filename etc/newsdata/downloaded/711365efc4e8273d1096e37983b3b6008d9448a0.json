We talked to commissioner Adam Silver yesterday about the biggest story in the league. https://t.co/IsBcFImNz4 \u2014 Ben Cohen (@bzcohen) October 22, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nSilver in @WSJ interview: \u2013 China situation was \"a perfect storm\"\n\n\u2013 NBA was \"collateral damage\" in trade talks\n\n\u2013 He was on a flight without WiFi when story broke\n\n\u2013 He still hasn't spoken to Yao\n\n\u2013 \"It was incumbent on me to look to de-escalate.\" \u2014 Ben Cohen (@bzcohen) October 22, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 \"I hear some people saying that we should disengage from China, and I respectfully disagree.\"\n\n\u2013 \"I read what I see as, to me, cartoonish characterizations of business.\"\n\n\u2013 \"Isolationism doesn\u2019t make sense in this highly interconnected world. We have no choice but to engage.\" \u2014 Ben Cohen (@bzcohen) October 22, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nSilver has made a compelling case that the NBA can spread the values it espouses \u2013 including free expression \u2013 by doing business around the world. Economic relationships foster connection between people.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, continuing to do business in China is also how the NBA maximizes its revenue. That\u2019s more than just convenient.\n\nThe NBA does have a chose whether or not to engage in China. It\u2019s a complicated choice. But the league is not beholden to continue doing business there.\n\nIt\u2019s questionable how well Silver\u2019s attempts to deescalate are working. Chinese state media said Silver will face retribution for saying China\u2019s government asked for Morey to be fired.\n\nOne thing that will help the NBA repair its relationship with Chinese business interests: Everyone around the league seems afraid to address the China-Hong Kong issue. Nobody wants to follow Morey into the center of a geopolitical firestorm and cost the NBA money.\n\nThat ought to raise questions about just how the NBA-China is working.", "description": "Silver has made a compelling case that the NBA can spread the values it espouses \u2013 including free expression \u2013 by doing business around the world.", "authors": ["Dan Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UbCusR1qtss4fDeGw0OKbw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OUxaJCDzYyAuzsChRkv_KA--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/6e4db13c6e6ca6bdcd28a4b8dc879057", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
