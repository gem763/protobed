Benioff currently serves as the company's co-CEO.\n\nBenioff's essay comes less than two weeks after fellow tech founder Mark Zuckerberg said he partially agreed with Sen. Bernie Sanders' declaration that billionaires should not exist at an employee Q&A session livestreamed by Facebook on October 3.\n\n\"On some level, no one deserves to have that much money,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I think if you do something that's good, you get rewarded. But I do think some of the wealth that can be accumulated is unreasonable.\"\n\nBillionaires Bill Gates, financier George Soros, investor Warren Buffett, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, Kaufman & Broad cofounder Eli Broad, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban have all spoken out in favor of higher taxes for the 1%, according to Forbes. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has said the current levels of inequality are unsustainable but come short of advocating for a tax, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nAmerica's wealth gap is widening\n\nAn analysis of tax data by the University of California at Berkeley's Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman for their upcoming book \"The Triumph of Injustice\" found that billionaires paid a smaller portion of their income in taxes in 2018 than average Americans. Billionaires paid 23% of their income in federal, state, and local taxes in 2018 while the average American paid 28%, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe top 1% of Americans own 40% of the country's wealth, Zucman wrote in a paper circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research in February.\n\nRead more: Here's how much money America's 10 wealthiest people would have if the US had a moderate wealth tax\n\nIn this climate of a widening wealth gap, presidential candidates and ultra-wealthy Americans alike have expressed support for a wealth tax.\n\nThough Benioff did not name a specific tax proposal, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's \"Ultra-Millionaire Tax\" is one of the most frequently cited proposals. The plan calls for a 2% annual tax on households with a net worth between $50 million and $1 billion, and a 3% annual tax on households with a net worth over $1 billion.\n\nThe idea has support from ultrawealthy and ordinary Americans alike: An Insider poll from January 2019 showed that more than half of the Americans surveyed support Warren's wealth tax proposal.\n\nSaez and Zucman found in a study published by the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity that if a moderate wealth tax had been introduced in 1982, Jeff Bezos' fortune would be half what it was in 2018. Bill Gates, meanwhile, would be $61 billion less rich.", "description": "Marc Benioff now joins the likes of George Soros, Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, and Eli Broad in asking for higher taxes on America's 1%.", "authors": ["Taylor Nicole Rogers"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5cf6fcc4a0a34fa767794?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
