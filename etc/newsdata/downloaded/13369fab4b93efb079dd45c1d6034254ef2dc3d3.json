Communication was lost just as it was about to touch down.\n\n\u201cData is being analysed,\u201d K Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), told distraught scientists at the agency\u2019s tracking centre in Bengaluru.\n\nThe Indian designed spacecraft, which had been orbiting the moon, began descending to the lunar surface at about 2007 GMT but scientists lost contact with it during the penultimate stage of the descent.\n\nFor a graphic on the spacecraft's planned landing sequence, click tmsnrt.rs/2MVmBPn\n\nA live broadcast from ISRO, India\u2019s equivalent of NASA, showed scientists grow tense and the floor fall silent as the control station struggled to get a signal from the lander.\n\n\u201cThere are ups and downs in life ... What you have accomplished is no small achievement,\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present at the ISRO centre, told scientists after being briefed by Sivan.\n\nISRO has not commented further, but Modi hinted in an address to the nation that the lander might have travelled at a higher-than-expected speed and crash landed on the moon.\n\n\u201cIf historians some day write about today\u2019s incident, they will certainly say that inspired by our romantic description of the moon throughout life, Chandrayaan, in the last leg of the journey, rushed to embrace the moon,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI can proudly say that the effort was worth it and so was the journey,\u201d Modi added.\n\nIn an emotional moment broadcast on TV channels, Modi embraced and consoled a visibly heart-broken Sivan.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacts with the scientists of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) at its headquarters in Bengaluru, India, September 7, 2019.

Beijing\u2019s Chang\u2019e-4 probe touched down on the far side this year, while Israel made an unsuccessful attempt to land its Beresheet spacecraft on the moon in April.\n\nThe south pole is believed to contain water as craters in the region are largely unaffected by the high temperatures of the sun. ISRO had hoped to confirm the presence of water in the form of ice, first detected on its mission in 2008.\n\nExperts said the lander and rover were only a part of the moon mission and Chandrayaan-2\u2019s orbiter was still orbiting the moon and will collect and send back valuable data for one year.\n\nMukund Rao, chief executive of the Centre for Spatial Analytics and Advanced GIS, said there may have been gaps in planning the moon landing.\n\n\u201cThey have to go back to the drawing board and try it once again,\u201d said Rao, a senior ISRO scientist for 24 years who later joined private and non-government space projects.\n\nHe said scientists need a deeper understanding of aspects such as braking and thrusting mechanisms, as well as the terrain of the moon. It was important to analyse the data and find out what happened, Rao said.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nIndia has further ambitions in space.\n\nLast year, Modi announced a 100 billion rupee project - named \u2018Gaganyaan\u2019 - that aims to send a three-member crew to low earth orbit by 2022.", "description": "India lost contact with a spacecraft it was trying to land on the moon on Saturday, its space agency said, in a setback for the nation's ambitious plans to become the first country to probe the unexplored lunar south pole.", "authors": ["Chris Thomas", "Abhirup Roy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427225866&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8608E", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
