People deserve much better than they have,\u201d Marcus said.\n\n\u201cIt is all about the people and we believe that there is still no network that is truly global and opens doors to people all over the world,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWith Libra, there is no money creation; we have a full one to one back reserve, there is no money creation whatsoever,\u201d Marcus highlighted, adding, \u201cWe also designed Libra in such a way so that any wallet can participate as long as KYC and AML requirements are met. It was designed to be competitive, but we still need to earn people\u2019s trust over time to use Calibra.\u201d\n\nHe also reiterated that there was a \u201cdata separation between Facebook and Libra\u201d and clarified that data would not be used for ad targeting but would bring distribution channels. \u201cMoving money around the world with WhatsApp and Messenger is what will bring real value on a day to day basis.\u201d\n\nYeah, but why blockchain?\n\nWhen asked why the project was leveraging blockchain technology, Marcus said \u201cIf you want to change the way that money moves around, there is no better way.\u201d\n\nMarcus also said that although Libra is intended for international payments, there was also potential for domestic payments.\n\n\u201cAML is something we need to address, and I want to say that the efficacy of sanction enforcing can be much higher on Libra than other payments networks. Digital to digital is more traceable than when cash in involved and will be more secure as it will run on real-time systems,\u201d he noted, concluding, \u201cThe open ledger \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 enables regulators to look at what is happening themselves and identify where the risk is without relying on reports. The onus is on us to do that work and now that we have the governance structure in place, we can now demonstrate this improvement.\u201d\n\nHis comments come amid heightened regulatory scrutiny, which caused several backers, including Mastercard and Paypal, to walk away from the project.\n\nIn his testimony before Congress last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he would be prepared to delay Libra\u2018s launch \u2014 originally planned for 2020 \u2014 until regulatory concerns were addressed.\n\nBut, while Facebook\u2018s regulatory battle is only just getting started, China is making great strides as it readies to launch its own digital currency.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say if and when Libra will launch, but we\u2019re certainly in for a wild ride.", "description": "Facebook\u2019s Libra lead has defended the technology giant\u2019s \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 project at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design-31.jpg&signature=8b85a7b872b1760851d5c0570eff3644", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
