Women bleed for five days on average - but it is normal for it to be a bit shorter or longer than this, the NHS says.\n\nResearchers analysed data on 93,775 women - who came from a variety of ages - between 1991 and 2013.\n\nParticipants had described the history of their menstrual cycles, reporting the usual length and regularity.\n\nThey did this at ages 14 to 17, 18-22, and 28-48. The women had no history of cancer, diabetes or cardiovascular disease at enrollment.\n\nResearchers accounted for relevant mortality risks, including BMI, race or ethnicity, physical activity and lifestyle factors.\n\nDuring an average of 18-year follow up, 1,679 deaths were recorded including 828 from cancer and 166 from cardiovascular disease.\n\nAbnormal menstrual cycle characteristics, such as irregularity and long cycle length, were linked to a greater likelihood of death.\n\nWomen whose menstrual cycles were always irregular between the ages of 18 to 22 were 34 per cent more likely to die from any cause over the course of the study than women reporting very regular menstrual cycles.\n\nBetween 14 and 17, women with irregular periods had 21 per cent higher odds of an early death.\n\nA similar pattern was seen in women with irregular menstrual cycles from age 28 to 48, but the figure was not made clear in the study abstract.\n\nWomen whose cycle lengths lasted 32-39 days or more than 40 days faced a 23 and 28 per cent greater risk of death, respectively.\n\nRISK FACTORS FOR POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects between eight and 12 percent of American women. The condition is marked by chronic ovarian cysts, which are fluid-filled sacs that can form if a follicle fails to deposit an egg. While any woman can get ovarian cysts, those with PCOS also have elevated levels of the male hormone, androgen. Scientists do not know what causes this endocrine abnormality, but it often coincides with obesity and insulin resistance. Yet, like many aspects of PCOS, obesity contribute to the development of PCOS, or the relationship may go in the opposite direction, such that PCOS causes weight gain.\n\nA menstrual cycle of more than 32 days in women aged between 28 and 48 years appeared to have an elevated risk of death by cancer and cardiovascular problems \u2013 such as heart disease, according to the researchers.\n\nDr Hugh Taylor, the ASRM's vice president, said: \u2018Irregular cycling could be evidence of an underlying health condition.\n\n\u2018But these clues are subtle and may not, in themselves, cause much worry.\n\n\u2018Patients who experience menstrual irregularity should be advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and be alert to health changes.\u2019\n\nEndometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease or thyroid problems are just some of the conditions that can cause irregular periods.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is thought to affect up to one in five women, is the one of the most studied.\n\nDeborah Lawlor, professor of epidemiology at Bristol Medical School, told MailOnline there are plenty of studies showing the link between irregular periods and disease.\n\nShe said: 'I have not personally done research in this area but I do know there is a very long history of papers showing an association between menstrual cycle irregularity and type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\n'The theory is that the irregular or long cycles reflect polycystic ovarian syndrome, or a tendency to it, which is thought to relate to insulin resistance and, or, they reflect overall lifetime lower oestrogen levels.\n\n'Seeing an association with mortality does not seem that odd to me. Whether any of these associations are causal is unknown.'\n\nHealth officials state there is no need to seek medical advice if your periods have always been irregular.\n\nHowever, it may be worth seeing a doctor if there are sudden changes.", "description": "Women whose periods fluctuated were up to a third more likely to die, according to scientists led by Harvard T.H.
