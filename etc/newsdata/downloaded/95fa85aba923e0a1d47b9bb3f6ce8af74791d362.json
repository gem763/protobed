For me, as the lead vocalist on this song, it\u2019s me confronting shame about not necessarily fitting in, questioning the role that a man in the 21st century is placed into.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatthias added: \u2018It raises questions of sexual identity and expression and repression.\n\n\u2018The literal translation of Kl\u00e1mstr\u00e1kur is Porn Boy, but porn in Icelandic is a broader term, it can be interpreted in different ways. Filthy is more in spirit with the track. Another possible translation was smut addict.\n\n\u2018Like any Hatari performance, it is theatrical in nature and we\u2019re always working with the contrasts between Klemens and I. Our two characters work as if they\u2019re coming from the same personality, but on a spectrum \u2013 two side of the same coin.\u2019\n\nHatari are a BDSM-inspired anti-capitalist art collective (Picture: AFP)\n\nFilthy Boy will be released on 8 November \u2013 the same day as Hatari\u2019s performance at Iceland Airwaves.\n\nWhen asked what fans can expect from Hatari\u2019s performance at the Reykjavik Art Museum, Matthias said: \u2018You can expect a thong-shaking bassline, a well rehearsed techno performance\u2026\n\nHopefully some well-rehearsed choreography and video graphics.\u2019\n\nKlemens pitched in: \u2018Infused with different media outlets \u2013 a visually stimulating, arousing experience.\u2019\n\nHatari achieved worldwide notoriety in May 2019 when, during Eurovision voting in Tel Aviv, they held up Palestinian banners and flags to protest Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\nHatari play Iceland Airwaves on Friday 8 November at the Reykjavik Art Museum.
