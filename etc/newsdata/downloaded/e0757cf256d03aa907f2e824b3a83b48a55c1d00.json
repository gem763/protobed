That\u2019s the important element. That\u2019s what the president is wedded to.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s this day or that day might be interesting to the media, but it isn\u2019t the real game,\u201d he told Fox Business Network.", "description": "The initial U.S.-China trade deal does not need to be finalized next month, the U.S. commerce secretary said on Monday even as President Donald Trump has said he would like to sign the pact when he meet his Chinese counterpart at November's APEC summit.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443346764&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0WU", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
