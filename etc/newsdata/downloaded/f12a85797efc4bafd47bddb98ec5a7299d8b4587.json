You may or may not have a little saved up and you\u2019re now thinking about finally putting your renting days behind you.\n\nBut can you actually afford a house on your salary? Will you be able to afford the bond repayments? How will it affect you financially? Well, the answer actually isn\u2019t all that complicated.\n\nAlbertus Van Staden, head of credit at FNB Housing Finance, spoke to Fin24 and says that there are a few things you\u2019ll need to assess your ability to repay your home loan - notably your income and expenses. These are used to calculate whether or not you\u2019ll be able to pay your mortgage.\n\nYour income\n\nYour income includes your (and perhaps your partner\u2019s) salary as well as any commission you receive or any other add-ons like allowances or overtime.\n\nIf your income is not the same every month due to factors like commission or overtime, then the bank will either use a lower portion of this amount, or a three-month average.\n\nYour expenses\n\nYour expenses are made up of three groups: credit, living and other expenses. These are things you are obligated to pay, essential expenses like transport and food that will be difficult to scale down.\n\nYour risk profile is then determined and your repayment of the loan is calculated.\n\nAccording to Property24, your risk rating and interest rate is usually lower if you can put down a deposit. If you don\u2019t have a little nest egg saved up already, you might want to put your house buying plans on hold while you save up. It might mean pulling back on those expensive nights out or going to the salon every month, but it\u2019ll be worth it in the end when you own your very own home.\n\nUse online tools to see how far you are from your goal\n\nProperty24 has an online bond calculator and affordability calculator so you can estimate just how much you\u2019ll be paying back on your house and/ or how much you can afford.\n\nWhile this may not be a completely accurate representation of what kind of home loan you\u2019ll get (you need to factor in your credit score and so on), it does give you an idea of what you\u2019ll need to get together to get your foot on the property ladder so to speak.\n\nJust because you\u2019re not earning as much as you\u2019d like yet doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t try to buy a house. But remember that your first house probably won\u2019t be the one you\u2019ve been dreaming of owning since you were little and that this is just the first step.\n\nThink about the hidden costs\n\nYou\u2019re not just paying your bond every month, but you might also need to pay rates and taxes or levies too.\n\nIf you\u2019re buying a house\n\nThe municipal rates cost, according to Etchells and Young covers all the services provided to you by your local municipality including sewerage, maintenance and the collection of refuse.\n\nProperty rates are calculated according to the value of the land the property is on as well as the property itself and any improvements that might have been made to it. So it\u2019s based on the market value of the property.\n\nThe overall municipal value will determine how much you will pay.\n\nIf you\u2019re buying a flat/townhouse/ or in a complex\n\nThere\u2019s usually a body corporate in place that establishes an administrative fund which will be used to cover expenses like maintenance costs, insurance cover, general repairs, etc.\n\nFor more information on how levies are raised and special levies, visit Etchells and Young\u2019s blog.\n\nTransfer and bond fees\n\nAccording to ooba.co.za, if you\u2019re buying a home for more than R900 000 you\u2019ll have to pay transfer costs which includes a transfer duty. Even if you\u2019re not taking out a home loan, you\u2019ll still have to pay a bond registration cost and bank initiation fee. These costs are not part of your bond repayments.\n\nYou can calculate what your transfer fees might be here\n\nWhat else?\n\nAlso remember the cost of water and electricity as well as the cost of homeowners insurance. Homeowners insurance does not cover the contents of your home, so if you\u2019re wanting to protect your personal possessions, you\u2019ll have to get separate insurance for that.\n\nMost importantly, remember that the interest rate will change over time and this will affect how much you have to repay.\n\nSource: W24\n\nBack to homepage.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://myhome.24.com/Can-you-actually-afford-to-buy-a-flat-or-a-house-/assets/gRGZC7oGJw/istock-637125708-2119x1414.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
