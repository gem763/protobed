I feel like at the moment all is as it should be in terms of people\u2019s feelings.\n\n\u201cWe have no disillusions about the fact that not everyone is going to approve of me playing this role but I think that it doesn\u2019t matter who would\u2019ve been chosen for the role the reaction would still be exactly the same,\u201d said KB.\n\nBahumi shared her sentiments.\n\n\u201cI knew that these were the reactions that would come about. It was one of the reasons why I was fearful of auditioning for the role,\u201d Madisakwane said, adding that the moment she found out it was an open call audition \u201cI anticipated getting there and people making all these assumptions. So I wasn\u2019t shocked.\u201d\n\nThe more vulnerable layers to Lebo\n\nKB revealed that this role has shown her new sides to Lebo that she never knew before.\n\n\u201cEveryone who knows Lebo knows that she had a very explosive character and personality. You have the performer, the wild child, her being at home or with her friends while also trying to be a businessperson but through this role I\u2019ve discovered the fragile and the vulnerable Lebo.\n\n\u201cWe knew the lioness who was larger than life out there making things happen yet we didn\u2019t know what she did when she was by herself without the dancers. I think that\u2019s the story that the writer wanted people to know,\u201d she said.\n\nMadisakwane said that playing this character has made her grow.\n\n\u201cI had fears and anxiety auditioning for the role but what I\u2019ve learnt is that you don\u2019t have to wait for your fears and anxiety to disappear, you just have to push through them and only then can you overcome them. That\u2019s the main connection I\u2019ve made.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not just this legendary superstar that we know, she\u2019s a human being. There\u2019s so much more to her and I hope people are able to see her humanity,\u201d she said.\n\n.
