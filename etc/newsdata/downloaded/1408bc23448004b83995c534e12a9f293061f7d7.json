Steve Orlando, spokesperson for the University of Florida, tells TIME says there is no specific topic Trump Jr. is expected to speak on but notes that it \u201ccan\u2019t be a campaign appearance,\u201d which is banned under the University of Florida\u2019s student government regulations on money used for speakers. He adds that there will be increased security at the event and local, state and federal law enforcement will be present.\n\nThe duo will be paid $50,000 according to Orlando.\n\nThe event is funded by money from an activity and services fee, which is mandatory for students attending classes on the campus. And students say they are not happy about their money being used to fund an event they say \u201cdisrespects various communities on campus, misuses student fees and poses a safety risk for marginalized groups.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Orlando said all available tickets \u2014 more than 800 \u2014 have already been \u201cfully distributed.\u201d Previous speakers in the last few years include comedian Hasan Minhaj, actor Kal Penn and right wing commentator Ben Shapiro.\n\nJust cancelling the event is not enough for protestors, who are also demanding an apology from organizers of the event for \u201ccausing undue stress to the student body and allowing student fees to subsidize a partisan political campaign,\u201d according to a press release they issued.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump and Guilfoyle said that they are \u201cextremely excited about speaking\u201d at the University of Florida and bringing their \u201cbold conservative perspectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey look forward to the opportunity to engage in meaningful and thoughtful dialogue with everyone in attendance about the importance of freedom, capitalism and our Constitutional rights,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe protesting group, organized under the name, #ChompTrump, plans to protest on Thursday at 5:30 p.m. at the University Auditorium. Organizers told TIME they expect more than 400 people to show up.\n\nJovanna Liuzzo, a freshman at the University of Florida studying political science and spokesperson for #ChompTrump, says the \u201cTrump agenda is not representative of the entire student body\u201d and that students are \u201cnot tolerant of hateful and discriminatory rhetoric.\u201d A major concern for the group is safety, Liuzzo says, adding that any protester \u201cis putting themselves at risk\u201d by showing up. \u201cWith events like this, we have to be on the right side of history,\u201d Liuzzo says.\n\nThe University of Florida issued a statement on Oct. 2 defending the right of the student government speakers bureau to invite Trump and Guilfoyle.\n\nThe university has \u201ccommitted itself to ensuring that a wide variety of viewpoints are heard on campus as well as to protecting the First Amendment rights of all those in attendance,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt the same time, the university recognizes the right of members of its community to analytically and respectfully challenge ideas so long as such challenges are conducted in a civil manner that does not stifle the open expression of the opposing ideas.\u201d\n\nOrlando said that state law forbids the school from weighing in on how student government spends money from the student activity and services fee. State law dictates that this fee \u201cshall be determined by\u201d student government.\n\nThis is not the first time the University of Florida has been embroiled in controversy over a speaker. White nationalist Richard Spencer gave a speech at the university in 2017 and was disrupted by dozens of protesters. Former Florida Gov. Rick Scott had declared a state of emergency ahead of Spencer\u2019s speech, citing clashes that erupted at his past events at college campuses. Orlando notes, though, that Spencer was not invited to campus and came to speak of his \u201cown accord.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Donald Trump Jr. plans to speak at the University of Florida Thursday, and his scheduled appearance has sparked protests among students.", "authors": ["Sanya Mansoor"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/donald-trump-jr.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C147px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
