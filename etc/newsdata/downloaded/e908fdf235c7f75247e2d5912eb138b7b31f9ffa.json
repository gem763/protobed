The meeting presumably would\u2019ve been the culmination of a year of negotiations with the Taliban aimed at finally forging peace in Afghanistan and bringing to an end America\u2019s 18-year war in the country.\n\nBut Mr. Trump abruptly canceled the meeting late Saturday night, citing a string of recent Taliban attacks that killed four U.S. service members and scores of civilians over the past three weeks.\n\nThat decision, the Taliban said, will have grave consequences.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to more losses to the U.S.,\u201d Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said, Reuters reported. \u201cIts credibility will be affected, its anti-peace stance will be exposed to the world, losses to lives and assets will increase.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that the administration was recalling its Afghan envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad. Mr. Khalilzad has held numerous in-person meetings with the Taliban in the hopes of securing a landmark peace agreement.\n\nAfghan officials also said over the weekend they do not believe peace talks will continue \u201cat this stage.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
