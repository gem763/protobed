You enter past an appealing baked-goods display to a narrow room, with wood panels, bottles stacked overhead, a few tables and a marble counter, behind which a team of too many chefs work in close quarters with good-humoured efficiency.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nA narrow staircase leads up to the second floor, where there\u2019s more of the same. In a group of more than four, you\u2019d feel like a stag do.\n\nThe menu is similarly delicate. Lyle\u2019s veterans will not be surprised that the emphasis is on seasonal ingredients without much done to them. Some of it is unassailable. The default press shot, and the dish that appears most on Instagram, is a plate of three scarlet prawns, which are not the strapping Oxbridge-educated langoustines you might expect for \u00a318, but decidedly prawnish.\n\nThe heads are served cooked, with a little plug of white meat stopping the brain juices from seeping out until you are ready. This presentation elevates the eating of the head, which I\u2019d always thought of as vaguely dirty, into a respectable activity. You pinch the antennae array, raise it to your lips, bite out the barrier and suck until all the fishy nectar has been extracted.\n\nThe bodies come on a separate plate, raw, tiny landscapes of translucent pink etched with purples and reds, bright with freshness and smeared with a yuzu orange kosho. The flesh offers just the right resistance to the bite, and the citrus cuts through the flavours of the sea.\n\nProsciutto and melon was, shockingly, prosciutto and melon. What am I doing ordering ham and melon in a place like this, like a 10-year-old? I want to have a long hard look about myself\n\nThe kitchen plays the same trick on a couple of oysters, adding scotch bonnet chilli to the mignonette, so the eating ends with a gentle rising heat rather than a cool red-onion sweetness.\n\nIt\u2019s confident but uncomplicated, as is a generous basket of springy sourdough, and a flatbread covered in cheese and garlic and mussels. A shallow dish of smooth cod brandade, golden yellow with little tangle of red peppers on top, was the fish pie your mother never made.\n\nGiven how good it is when it\u2019s good, you can see why people want to rave about Flor, but not everything sticks the landing. At \u00a3130 for two, this is a bit of a shame.\n\nSea bass came lying under a shroud of thinly sliced green tomatoes, like old furniture under tarpaulin, with an olive sauce that failed to add much to the fish.\n\nProsciutto and melon was, shockingly, prosciutto and melon. What am I doing ordering ham and melon in a place like this, like a 10-year-old? I want to have a long, hard look at myself.\n\nHalfway through the meal, eyes bigger than stomachs, we ordered a tart of daterini tomatoes and ricotta, beautifully presented but a bit earthy.\n\nDid we drink some wine? Yes, a couple of glasses of riesling.\n\nThey save the best until last. The brown butter cakes, which sound harmless, turn out to be no talk and all trousers. They are presented unadorned on their plate. Go on then, they say. Eat us. See if we care. But when I do, I\u2019m briefly reminded of the million-calorie eclair in The Simpsons, with 25lbs of butter per square inch, and then remember that that plot line was about a chef trying to kill a reviewer.\n\nStill, these cakes are like some kind of experiment in miniaturisation, to see if the richness and flavour of 10 full-grown cakes can be baked into one warm, sweet, buttery puck. Like Flor, they pack a lot into a little.\n\nWould I got back? Yes, for cake at very least\n\nShould you go? Yes\n\nCould you take your parents? Yes, but no more than two of them", "description": "Flor is one of the most anticipated new openings of 2019, a restaurant and bakery in Borough Market from the team behind Lyle\u2019s, James Lowe\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurant in Shoreditch.
