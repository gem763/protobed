Concerns have been raised that local candidates are being deliberately left off longlists created by the national executive committee in favour of people on the left with a national profile, but the party denies this is the case.\n\nA Momentum spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re very happy to see a new generation of leftwing MP candidates being selected in safe Labour seats across the country.\n\n\u201cThis is down to the hard graft of local activists and the widespread support among grassroots Labour members for a new generation of leftwing MPs committed to backing a radical, transformative agenda when in government.\u201d\n\nOf the 33 seats where a new Labour candidate must be chosen due to the sitting MP retiring, defecting to another party or currently being under suspension, so far 12 seats have gone to a Momentum-backed candidate, compared with seven for centrists.\n\nOver the weekend, those opposing Corbyn\u2019s leadership hailed the result for the ultra-safe seat of Vauxhall in south London, where Corbyn\u2019s former political secretary Katy Clark was heavily outvoted in favour of Florence Eshalomi, the London assembly member for Lambeth and Southwark.\n\nHow to replace Kate Hoey? My local party showed that stitch-ups aren\u2019t working | Zoe Williams Read more\n\nIn leave-voting Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, a remain-backing former London councillor, Sally Gimson, won the selection ahead of two leftwing challengers. The Momentum-backed candidate in Blyth Valley, Northumberland, also missed out to a local government figure.\n\nElsewhere in non-Labour-held seats, Momentum\u2019s vice-chair Emina Ibrahim lost to a local councillor in Finchley and Golders Green, north London, to challenge the sitting Tory Mike Freer, and ex-Labour MP Luciana Berger, who is now standing for the Liberal Democrats in the seat.\n\nLuke Akehurst, secretary of the centre-left group Labour First, said: \u201cIf Labour returns the same number of MPs, the hard left could get a minimum of 44 MPs, and a maximum of 55.\n\n\u201cThey are not going to have to worry about not getting their leadership candidate on the ballot paper, which is a big moral thing for them, but it\u2019s hardly the dramatic reshaping of the parliamentary Labour party that they dreamt of.\u201d\n\nHe said the centre-left side of the party had had success in Ashfield, Bassetlaw, Blyth Valley, Cynon Valley, Enfield North, Vauxhall and Ynys M\u00f4n so far.\n\nIn Poplar and Limehouse, east London, the Met police were called to the selection ballot after people said they felt intimidated as hundreds of party members tried to pour into a church to vote.\n\nAccording to reports in the Evening Standard, hundreds of people turned out to vote for Corbyn supporter and Momentum-backed Apsana Begum following the retirement of longstanding MP Jim Fitzpatrick.\n\nVideo footage showed people cramming to get into St Paul\u2019s church in Bow Common.\n\nThe party said it was confident the process had been run correctly.\n\nA Labour insider from the soft-left wing of the party said the five results from over the weekend show that the grip of Karie Murphy, Corbyn\u2019s former chief of staff who has been seconded to oversee the party\u2019s general election campaign, was weakening.\n\nThey said: \u201cKarie Murphy\u2019s grip is slipping. Where she cannot stitch up the shortlist, and even in some places where she has, she is failing to get her \u2018chosen one\u2019 selected.\n\n\u2026 There is a moderate fightback across the country. Partly because members are less bothered by Corbyn but party because the \u2018stitch and fix\u2019 is back-firing and members don\u2019t like their selection being decided by national party staff.\u201d\n\nThe 12 seats that have gone to left candidates are in Barrow, Birkenhead, Bury South, Ealing North, Ilford South, Liverpool Wavertree, Nottingham East, Penistone & Stocksbridge, Poplar & Limehouse, Rother Valley, Sheffield Hallam and Stockport.", "description": "Momentum-backed candidates expected to win majority of contests despite surge for centrists", "authors": ["Kate Proctor", "Nils Pratley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19d2efc1e11d7cbfaf27251725798eec376def98/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b638480cef3dcc0115c9d58d3b599a12", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
