Wall Street also glossed over Snap's estimate it would reach profitability in the fourth quarter, as measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nOn a conference call with analysts, Snap Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said the company's peak advertising demand period, which runs between the Black Friday and December holidays, had one fewer week this year, and was reflected as a \"headwind\" in the guidance.\n\nSnapchat, popularized by its photo visual effects which allow users to change gender in photos or add a dog filter over their face, had 210 million daily active users in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from 203 million in the prior quarter.\n\nIt had 186 million users in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe number, a widely watched metric by investors and advertisers, was above analysts' average estimate of 206.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nSnapchat faces competition from several other apps for the coveted younger demographic, including Facebook Inc's <FB.O> Instagram and newer apps like TikTok, used to create and share short lip-sync, comedy and talent videos.\n\nInvestors are still cautious about Snap, given the company's tumultuous past and \"irregular user-engagement record,\" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.\n\n\"A slight miss on expectations would be enough to hurt the stock and revive the old memories,\" he said.\n\nRevenue, which the company largely makes by selling advertising on the app, jumped about 50% to $446.2 million in the third quarter and beat an average analyst estimate of $435.05 million.\n\nAverage revenue per user jumped 33% to $2.12 during the quarter from a year earlier.\n\nIn remarks released before the conference call with analysts, Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said this year's growth has put the company \"on a clear path to Q4 adjusted EBITDA profitability.\"\n\nThe company's net loss narrowed to $227.4 million, or 16 cents per share, from $325.1 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, Snap posted a loss of 4 cents per share in the quarter. Analysts had expected a loss of 5 cents per share.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru and Sheila Dang in New York; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, Richard Chang and Chris Reese)", "description": "The parent company of photo messaging app Snapchat estimated fourth-quarter revenue of $540 million (\u00a3418.99 million) to $560 million, the midpoint of which was below analysts' estimate of $555.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
