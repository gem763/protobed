While some will inevitably fall away amid the attrition of a 46-game season, a bumper group of fallen giants, new pretenders and perennial contenders will be targeting success come May.\n\nSlaven Bilic has revitalised the big-spending Baggies, Marcelo Bielsa wants a second bite at the cherry with Leeds and Swansea, under the untested Steve Cooper, have mounted a surprise charge for the summit.\n\nAgainst many pre-season predictions, Swansea are competing at the top of the Championship\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Championship\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nNottingham Forest, having spent heavily in recent years, are also showing positive signs under Sabri Lamouchi, while Lee Johnson's Bristol City and the Fulham of Scott Parker will be keen on securing a coveted play-off spot.\n\nAfter Andre Ayew stabbed in the winning goal against Charlton on September 28 - which saw Swansea briefly rise to the Championship summit - his first thought was to race over to boss Cooper for an embrace to celebrate his first league goal for the April 2016.\n\nReturning to west Wales this summer after an unproductive loan at Fenerbahce, it was expected that he and his inflated wages would be ushered out of the club, alongside one-time record signing Borja Baston.\n\nBaston returned for pre-season training after two consecutive season-long loans at Malaga then Alaves returned six goals in 42 games. 10 games into this season, he has already matched that and is Swansea's top scorer.\n\nThese two are now key figures in a fairly eclectic squad, featuring remnants of their Premier League days such as Kyle Naughton and Mike van der Hoorn, as well as Matt Grimes and Jay Fulton as youth players eventually come good.\n\nBorja Baston is finally coming good at Swansea after being cast aside by previous managers\n\nCooper has been fairly active in the transfer market, recruiting six players. However, four of those \u2013 Freddie Woodman, Ben Wilmot, Sam Surridge and Aldo Kalulu \u2013 were unheralded loans. The fifth, Jake Bidwell, was a free transfer from QPR. Kristoffer Peterson was the only outlay, \u00a3500,000 from Dutch side Heracles Almelo. The Swedish winger has made just two league appearances to date.\n\nLeeds are another side who have moved on players for profit, with Kemar Roofe, Pontus Jansson and Jack Clarke all sold, but they have not been shy in recruiting from the top. Helder Costa and Eddie Nketiah have come in on big loan deals from Wolves and Arsenal respectively with the pair gradually integrated into Bielsa's style as two of six loan signings.\n\nAfter suffering play-off defeat last season, Marcelo Bielsa will be hoping to take Leeds up\n\nWest Brom have gradually refreshed and trimmed their Premier League stars, and let a raft of senior players go with Jay Rodriguez, Craig Dawson and Salomon Rondon now gone.\n\nHowever, with \u00a38million Kenneth Zohore, Darnell Furlong and Matheus Pereira arriving, they have not been shy in recruiting either. Of the \u00a326m raised, \u00a317m has gone straight back into a squad still stacked with Premier League quality.\n\nPreston, in fourth, and Bristol, in sixth, are examples of more long-term approaches to developing squads that are now bearing plenty of fruit. Lee Johnson saw several players leave, including \u00a320m Adam Webster to Brighton, but bought sagely by tying loanees to the club permanently.\n\nBristol City lost defender Adam Webster to Premier League Brighton for \u00a320million\n\nMichael Hector, who arrived for \u00a38m from Chelsea, joins an expensive array of loanees from Ivan Cavaleiro to Bobby Decordova-Reid, Harry Arter and Harrison Reed.\n\nIn seventh, three points back, are a Fulham side still flush with the exuberance of last season's doomed Premier League stay. Of that squad, only Jean-Michel Seri \u2013 on loan to Galatasaray \u2013 Franck-Zambo Anguissa and Ryan Sessegnon have left.\n\nIn contrast, Cooper was shorn of \u00a330m in talent. Oli McBurnie, last season's top scorer, departed for Sheffield United for a fee of \u00a320m. Also sold, for \u00a317.5m, was speedster Daniel James, headed to Manchester United.\n\nAdd in a \u00a32m fee from Crystal Palace to make Jordan Ayew's loan permanent, and Swansea accumulated made around \u00a329.5m in net profit from transfers this summer, yet somehow have come out looking stronger.\n\nSwansea's top scorer Oli McBurnie was among the players to leave the club this summer\n\nCHAMPIONSHIP SQUAD VALUES 1 - West Brom \u00a373.2m 2 - Nottingham Forest \u00a363.95m 3 - Preston North End \u00a325.74m 4 - Swansea City \u00a343.9M 5 - Leeds United \u00a381m 6 - Bristol City \u00a350.76m 7 - Fulham \u00a3122.4m\n\nCooper, England Under-17 boss until moving to west Wales this summer, has no previous senior management experience.\n\nHe is, instead, highly regarded for his work with Liverpool as academy head between 2008 and 2013 and then in the England system, his crowning achievement being the 2017 Under-17 World Cup win.\n\nThat, however, pales in comparison to the accolades garnered by his rivals at the top of the table.\n\nBielsa, of course, has long been known as an idol of Pep Guardiola, while his own accolades include leading Argentina to a 2004 Olympic gold medal and helping Athletic Bilbao finish as 2012 Europa League and Copa Del Rey runners-up.\n\nHis reputation took something of a battering, however, during last season's Spygate scandal, where Leeds staff were found to have covertly watched promotion rivals Derby's private preparations for their upcoming match.\n\nIn Slaven Bilic, West Brom have appointed a coach with a huge range of experience\n\nBefore moving to West Brom, Bilic had accumulated nearly two decades of managerial experience, starting at Hajduk Split in 2001 then covering six years with Croatia national team and two seasons in east London with West Ham.\n\nElsewhere the pedigree keeps rising; Johnson, at three years and eight months, is the division's longest serving boss with a Bristol City side made in his own image, while Nottingham Forest have Lamouchi, a two-time Ligue 1 winner as a player, at the helm.\n\nSabri Lamouchi has enjoyed a positive start as manager of Nottingham Forest\n\nWith four points separating top and 10th, no side has been able to take a hold of the league in the manner of Wolves or Norwich in recent seasons past.\n\nSwansea struck the first blow in the title race with a last-gasp winner against Leeds at the end of August, but suffered their first defeat of the season two weeks later at home to Nottingham Forest. They have managed an impressive level of consistency, with more to come from a developing team.\n\nA win over Preston could also help in their race to the top, with the Lilywhites' only other loss coming at Millwall on opening day.\n\nCurrent table-toppers West Brom have lost only once, to Leeds, but their follow-up 4-2 win over Cardiff City last weekend suggested it won't have a lasting effect.\n\nBielsa's side, apart from the late Swansea defeat, have also suffered damaging losses to Charlton and Millwall teams they would expect to beat.\n\nThe challenge now is for the clubs to maintain their start through a typically demanding run to Christmas.\n\nBut, with such a tightly-knit league table, this could turn out to be one of the most exciting battles for Premier League promotion in history.\n\nThe race is on.", "description": "While the Championship's promotion race is notoriously tight, this year's push for the Premier League is looking like it could be the closest for many years.", "authors": ["James Ayles For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/18/19551184-0-image-a-34_1570728000853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
