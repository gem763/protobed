Martinez, the 62-year-old former governor of Montevideo, had 36% of the vote against 30% for Lacalle Pou of the center-right National Party with 55% of voting stations reporting, according to the Electoral Court.\n\nPreliminary results suggest the Broad Front will lose its majorities in the Senate and Lower House, according to Ignacio Zuasnabar, director at pollster Equipos Consultores.\n\n\u201cWe know the Uruguayan people are an intelligent people who will vote for those who offer concrete proposals and certainties and not a blank check\u201d for austerity policies, Martinez told his supporters in reference to the runoff.\n\nThe Broad Front has controlled the presidency and congress since 2005 thanks to a decade-long commodities boom that bankrolled heavy spending on social programs, pensions, and a big expansion in government payrolls. However, growth has slowed to just 1.6% a year since President Tabare Vazquez started his second five-year term in 2015, while his party\u2019s income redistribution policies have led to unsustainable deficits.\n\nLacalle Pou, the son of a former president, faces the challenge between now and the runoff of making good on his pledge to create a \u201cmulti-color\u201d coalition government with other opposition parties ranging from the center-left to the hard right.\n\nThe third and fourth place candidates pledged their support for him Sunday evening. Ernesto Talvi of the center-right Colorado Party received 12.9% of the votes and ex-Army general Guido Manini Rios of the right-wing Open Forum party took 11%.\n\nAs Uruguay looks like it may turn to the political right, across the river in Argentina, the left is returning to power after Alberto Fernandez defeated incumbent Mauricio Macri 48% to 40% on Sunday evening amid a deepening economic crisis.\n\nThe winner of the Nov. 24 runoff will start his five-year term on March 1, 2020.", "description": "Uruguay\u2019s Presidential Election Headed to November Runoff", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picde2d36458fda61ac049aa708cc91a7e4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
