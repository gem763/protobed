It collected data on 3.9 million patients with seven types of cancer: esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung and ovary. The cancers were diagnosed between 1995 and 2014, and followed up until Dec. 31, 2015.\n\nResearchers say that while survival rates continue to improve in high-income countries, likely thanks to improved treatment and earlier diagnosis, disparities persist.\n\nWhen it comes to lung cancer \u2014 the leading cause of cancer deaths in Canada \u2014 statistics taken between 2010 and 2014 show the five-year survival rate in this country was highest at 22 per cent. It was lowest in the U.K. at 15 per cent.\n\nColon cancer survival rates were second-highest in Canada at 67 per cent, behind Australia's 71 per cent survival rate.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian esophageal cancer survival rates were among the lowest at 16 per cent \u2014 that's compared to Australia where patients had a 23.5 per cent survival rate.\n\nThe Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, one of the funders of the research, said while Canada's overall average survival generally compares well, there was often more disparity among the provinces than across the countries. The group said it strives to promote equity of access to quality cancer care.\n\nOne-year and five-year survival increased in each country across almost all cancer types from 2010 to 2014, but the highest one-year survival for most types was in Australia, followed by Canada and Norway.\n\nThe lowest one-year survival involved stomach, colon, rectal and lung cancer in the U.K.; and for esophageal cancer in Canada, pancreatic cancer in New Zealand and ovarian cancer in Ireland.\n\nData on more than 762,000 Canadian cancer cases in all provinces except Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador were included.", "description": "New research shows where Canada ranks internationally in survival for seven types of cancer.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5281139.1568315790!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cancer-survival-international-20190912.jpg"}
