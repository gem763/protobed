We\u2019re trying to report the news here, and thousands of people watching have just witnessed the assault,\u201d he tells the camera.\n\nEarlier in his Facebook Live broadcast, he had identified himself as an XR member.\n\nHe said: \u201cExtinction Rebellion are calling on the government to commit to becoming carbon-neutral by 2025, and to enact a citizens\u2019 assembly giving all the citizens a voice and power in government.\n\n\u201cThis action is not targeted to disrupt people on the Tube, this action is targeted at government. The activists here are expressing their rage, their frustration.\n\n\u201cWe do not enjoy disrupting passengers on the Tube, but there is no option here.\u201d\n\nXR has been contacted for comment and an interview with the activist who filmed the Canning Town protest.\n\nSo-called \u201caffinity groups\u201d are allowed to conduct autonomous protests using XR branding. The organisation says it has a \u201cdecentralised\u201d structure.\n\nBut The Independent has learned that in an internal poll of XR activists, a huge majority opposed action to disrupt the London Underground.\n\nNearly three-quarters \u2013 or 72 per cent \u2013 of more than 3,800 respondents said they believed the plan was a \u201cbad idea no matter how it\u2019s done\u201d, while a further 14 per cent were \u201copposed if people might be blocked underground\u201d.\n\nThe figures were revealed in a poll on the encrypted Telegram messaging app.\n\nA press release on XR\u2019s website said: \u201cThis morning a number of Extinction Rebellion UK affinity groups are peacefully disrupting the London Underground because there is an emergency. The climate and ecological emergency.\n\n\u201cActivists are glued onto trains in order to prevent them from running and plan on nonviolently breaking the law, then waiting to be removed and arrested by the British Transport Police.\"", "description": "An Extinction Rebellion (XR) activist captured on video the moment an angry mob of commuters turned on him as protesters stopped Tube trains in east London.
