Unemployment, meanwhile, dropped by around half, to six percent over that period.\n\nSunday's exit polls indicate Costa may have to pursue alliances with other left-of-centre parties to pass legislation.\n\nPortuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa arrives at Altis hotel in Lisbon during the Portuguese General Election [Patricia De Melo Moreira/ AFP]\n\nIn 2015, it took less than two months for Costa, whose party had actually come second, behind the Social Democrats, to strike an unexpected alliance with two far-left, Eurosceptic parties, the Left Bloc and the Communists and be sworn in as prime minister.\n\nThe People-Animals-Nature party (PAN), which has ridden a wave of popularity of pro-environment parties in much of Europe, landed in a range of 2.3 percent to 5.3 percent of Sunday's vote.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if it could become a kingmaker.\n\n\"It's a very good result. I still wish it was more, because the country needs to move quickly to tackle the climate emergency. But with just a few representatives I'm confident PAN can be effective,\" PAN supporter Paulo Santos, 43, said at the party's evening rally.\n\nThe next government faces plenty of challenges, including the United Kingdom's impending departure from the EU. The UK is one of Portugal's main export markets.\n\nWhile government spending is now more in line with revenues, Portugal's government debt is equivalent to more than 120 percent of gross domestic product - the third highest in the European Union.", "description": "Incumbent party set to win most votes in Sunday's parliamentary election, but may still fall short of a majority.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/6/214777b340474514a484b517d843b936_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
