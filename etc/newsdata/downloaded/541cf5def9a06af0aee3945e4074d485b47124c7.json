They originally zeroed in on homes in the inner west but switched to the lower north shore after realising it offered more family-friendly options.\n\nIt was this flexibility with locations that helped them finally bag a two-bedroom apartment in Roseville for around the $900,000 mark in August, through Mortgage Choice, Ms Oates said. \u201cWe still had to look at a lot of different suburbs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hardest part was just finding something suitable for us.\u201d\n\nMs Oates said they felt good to be owners after a year of looking. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty excited.\u201d", "description": "Home seekers who want the best chance of squeezing out a great deal on properties will find sellers are offering the most generous buying terms in an often overlooked part of Sydney.", "authors": ["Aidan Devine"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/04150034/capi_0d1af73318a61a1140f0d81328524b42_9fba1f8960a0acaa46943e24ed752e64.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
