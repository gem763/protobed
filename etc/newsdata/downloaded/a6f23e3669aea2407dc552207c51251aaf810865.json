It will include a switch to refillable bottles.\n\nAnglo-Dutch giant Unilever, which makes more than 400 products, claims it is the first global consumer goods company to commit to an absolute reduction in the use of plastics.\n\nChief executive Alan Jope said: \u2018We are not against plastic. We think it plays an important role in society. But the place for plastic is not in the environment.\u2019\n\nUnilever will reduce the total used in bottles and cartons from around 700,000 tons over the next six years\n\nHowever, critics say Unilever will increase the use of recycled plastic by up to 250,000 tons a year, which means a net reduction of only 100,000 tons.\n\nCampaign group A Plastic Planet said the firm was \u2018showing real intent to turn off the plastic tap\u2019. But it added: \u2018Unilever is one of the top five polluters. We want to see them being more ambitious by reducing overall plastic by 50 per cent.\u2019\n\nUnilever said it would invest in having more reusable or refillable packs for its products as well as cutting the amount of plastic used in its packaged goods. It said that it would also use alternative wrappings or, where possible, put goods \u2018naked\u2019 on the shelf.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch giant, whose brands include Domestos, claims it is the first global consumer goods company to commit to an absolute reduction in the use of plastics\n\nIt said the greater use of concentrates, for example in washing liquids and cleaners, reduced the use of plastics by 75 per cent. It also highlighted initiatives such as its introduction of shampoo bars, cardboard wrapped deodorant sticks and bamboo toothbrushes.\n\nCritics say Unilever will increase the use of recycled plastic by up to 250,000 tons a year, which means a net reduction of only 100,000 tons. One of Unilevers brands is Marmite\n\nThe switch to pouches of laundry liquid and cleaning fluids can create problems. Just last week, the makers of Dettol were warned over bogus plastic reduction claims following the introduction of pouches alongside refillable bottles.\n\nThe problem relates to the fact that many councils do not allow householders to put the pouches, which are made of a complex mix of materials, into recycling bins, while they do collect the plastic bottles.\n\nMr Jope added: 'Our starting point has to be design, reducing the amount of plastic we use, and then making sure that what we do use increasingly comes from recycled sources.\n\n\u2018We are also committed to ensuring all our plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable.\u2019\n\nPaula Chin, sustainable materials specialist at WWF UK, said: \u2018Unilever\u2019s ambition to slash their plastic usage and to process more plastic than it sells is a welcome step.\n\n\u2018We need to see more businesses, producers and governments all taking greater responsibility.\n\n\u2018The natural world isn\u2019t a luxury - it is our life support system, and we must act now to protect it, before it\u2019s too late.\u2019", "description": "Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever's brands include Domestos, Dove, Hellmann's and Marmite.
