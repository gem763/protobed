Everybody\u2019s emotional states are different,\u201d Brady said Monday in a radio interview on WEEI in Boston. \u201cHow do you contribute \u2014 whether someone is hurting physically, mentally, emotionally \u2014 how do you provide to them what they may need in order to support them to help us all grow and evolve. Not only as individuals. Not only as members of the team. Not only as members of the family. Not only as members of a community.\n\n\u201cBut everybody has different challenges. I think you recognize those challenges, try to provide them as best as possible, and go to bed at night trying to do the best you can do. If things don\u2019t work as you hoped, then absolutely when you put your heart on the line, there\u2019s emotions that come up. A lot of things are not always in our control. But you wake up the next day and try to find hope and optimism.\u201d\n\nBrown was released Friday, likely losing his $9 million signing bonus, and became a free agent for the second time in 13 days. Agent Drew Rosenhaus claimed Sunday morning that teams have reached out regarding Brown. But Brown said via social media he\u2019s done with the NFL, criticizing Patriots owner Robert Kraft on his way out of Boston.\n\nNFL teams are also going to be looking for clarity on Brown\u2019s availability. The league investigation into sexual assault claims against Brown by his former trainer is active, and he could be a candidate for the Commissioner\u2019s Exempt List if signed.\n\n\u201cI do have a lot of personal feelings \u2014 none of which I really care to share,\u201d Brady said of the move.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of teammates over the years, so you invest \u2014 not just your head, but your heart. You invest your soul. That\u2019s what makes a great team. That\u2019s what makes a great brotherhood. So I think in the end, the endearing trait about sports for me is the relationships I get to build, because they\u2019re very meaningful. That\u2019s at the heart, I think, philosophically, (of) my life. It\u2019s really about great relationships and seeing guys from all different backgrounds. I think it brings all of us together in so many ways.\u201d\n\nBrady did offer insight into his thoughts on the matter and how the Brown situation is reflective of today\u2019s culture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy for us to blame and shame because everyone has a voice now,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of them can just be nameless, faceless comments that are very difficult for people. You love too much, that\u2019s a problem. You hate too much, that\u2019s a problem. You win too much, that\u2019s a problem. You lose too much, that\u2019s a problem. Everything ends up being a problem. So you just have to focus on, look at yourself, and \u2018What do I believe in? What are my beliefs?\u2019 I\u2019m responsible for my own beliefs. I\u2019m responsible for my own actions. And I\u2019m going to do the best I can do to contribute in the best way possible. I\u2019m not going to add on. I\u2019m not going to be a part of this culture that can become very negative, can become very blaming, very much point fingers.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Tom Brady declined to share specific personal feelings about the New England Patriots releasing wide receiver Antonio Brown, but hinted the team could have done more to support his teammate of a mere 11 days.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432981721&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M19D-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
