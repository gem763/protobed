Those with compromised immune systems such as people with HIV are more vulnerable to falling sick.\n\nThe announcement came as thousands of researchers, TB survivors and activists gathered in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad for a global conference on lung health.\n\nIndia accounts for a quarter of the world's TB cases and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set an ambitious target of ending the epidemic by 2025.", "description": "Scientists said Tuesday they are closing in on a new game-changing vaccine for tuberculosis, the world's deadliest infectious disease that claimed some 1.5 million lives last year.
