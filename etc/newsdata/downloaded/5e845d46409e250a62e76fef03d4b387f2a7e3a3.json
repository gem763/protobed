He\u2019s hit his stride of late, though, scoring back-to-back knockouts of Ben Askren and Darren Till to set up the bout with Diaz.\n\nHe did put in some memorable work prior to those key wins, though, and one of them came against \u201cCowboy,\u201d who was on an undefeated run after changing weight classes. It was a one-sided beatdown at UFC on FOX 23 in Denver, with \u201cGamebred\u201d nearly finishing Cerrone at the end of the first round, only to finish the job in devastating fashion just 60 seconds into the second frame.\n\nRelive that standout performance by Masvidal, who looks to become the inaugural \u201cBMF\u201d champion at UFC 244.\n\nGallery Photos: Jorge Masvidal through the years view 44 images", "description": "Jorge Masvidal's best welterweight wins have come this year but the UFC 244 headliner also showed brilliance against Donald Cerrone in 2017.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jorge-masvidal-donald-cerrone-ufc-on-fox-23.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
