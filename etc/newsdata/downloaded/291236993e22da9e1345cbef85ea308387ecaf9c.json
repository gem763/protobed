Kipchoge will run 4.4 laps of a 9.6 kilometer course, consisting of a long straight with a loop at each end.\n\nThe sport's governing body, the IAAF, will not recognize the run as an official record because it is not in open competition and it uses in and out pacemakers.\n\nKipchoge, 34, the reigning Olympic champion who set an official world record of 2:01.39 at the Berlin marathon in September last year, missed out by 26 seconds when he previously attempted to break the two-hour barrier in Monza in May 2017, a race run without spectators.\n\nThe 34-year-old will be supported by 41 pacemakers who will run in rotating groups and will form a V shape around Kipchoge - as opposed to a diamond formation in Monza - to try and protect him from the wind.\n\nThey will also follow an electric pace car that has been programmed to complete the course in 1:59.50 to ensure that Kipchoge runs a steady pace.
