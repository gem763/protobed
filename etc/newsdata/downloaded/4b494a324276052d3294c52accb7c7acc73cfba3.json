Yet, they were farming for the peanut program.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Sam McCann, R-Plainview, was in attendance and said that was a great message.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we are meeting the supply and demand ratio,\u201d McCann said, \u201cand that people are properly rewarded for that so that they can make a living providing that food to the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nFarmers told Perdue they don\u2019t want changes to the subsidy program, which they characterized as a safety net.\n\nPerdue said some industries might need to be separated in the insurance program, like keeping cattle separate from milk, but \u201cI\u2019m glad you feel like the insurance program has done well on the cash grain guys and I know that Congress will take that into consideration as well.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. John Shimkus, R-Collinsville, was also in attendance Monday. He said \u201cMother Nature, you just can\u2019t control that, so you need a safety net.\u201d\n\n\u201cFarmers pay into it,\u201d Shimkus said. \u201cThey quibble about how much they pay in, how much is covered \u2026 but the agriculture community needs at least a safety net so they can continue to be in the field.\u201d\n\nPerdue said the USDA plans to do more with less to help alleviate the nation\u2019s debt.\n\nAside from what would be in the federal farm bill, international trade was one of the chief concerns Perdue heard about.\n\nPerdue was praised by the Illinois Farm Bureau for urging the Trump Administration to stay in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). But Perdue said the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) was bad for the U.S.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we have more in common in this North American continent than we do within all the TPP nations,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s worked very well. Agriculture has benefited very well under NAFTA for the most part.\u201d\n\nHe said some of the fruit producers in southern states might not be happy with the deal, but the grain and livestock industries continue to benefit from the agreement.\n\nA cattle farmer in attendance said something has to be done with the recent tariff of 50 percent that Japan imposed on U.S. beef. Purdue said they\u2019ll work to correct that.\n\n\u201cI think many agriculturalists were disappointed over the TPP,\u201d Perdue said, \u201cbut frankly I do believe that President [Donald] Trump is right. I think that we\u2019re going to be tough negotiators and negotiating bilateral deals and we just have to start very quickly.\u201d\n\nPurdue said he believes Japan wants a bilateral agreement, and he\u2019s headed to Asian markets to hash out deals soon.", "description": "Stopping at a family farm just outside of Springfield, the .09/02/2019 3:10:31AM EST.", "authors": ["Greg Bishop", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
