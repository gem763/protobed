The Balmoral in Edinburgh is also one of my favourite hotels of all our collection. Also, I like going to Cornwall in the summer \u2014 my sister Olga has the Hotel Tresanton in St Mawes.\n\nCan\u2019t travel without?\n\nMy blackberry \u2014 it\u2019s a little old fashioned, now I know, but I\u2019m used it to and I like the way the keyboard works.\n\nFavourite holiday activity?\n\nI like some culture, but not too much as I also want to relax.\n\nYour idea of holiday hell?\n\nAirports \u2014 so congested and the airlines treat you like cattle nowadays. Flying is no longer a glamorous way to travel.\n\nMost memorable holiday?\n\nSir Rocco recalls a great fishing trip to Iceland where he caught nearly 100 fish in 10 days\n\nI had a great fishing trip to Iceland a few years ago \u2014 I caught nearly 100 fish in ten days. I loved the place for its rugged volcanic terrain and the complete wilderness of it all.\n\nWhere do you want to revisit?\n\nNew Zealand. I loved it \u2014 it\u2019s like a mix of Scotland, Canada and Iceland. So much space \u2014 and the light there is wonderful.\n\nEarliest holiday memory?\n\nWhen I was young I used to visit my grandparents in Monforte, a little village south of Rome, it was quite primitive and they didn\u2019t even have running water, but it was such a beautiful place.", "description": "Hotelier Sir Rocco Forte talks about why The Balmoral in Edinburgh is one of his favourite hotels, a great fishing trip to Iceland - and more...", "authors": ["Tessa Williams For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/28/10/19038760-0-image-a-17_1569661548212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
