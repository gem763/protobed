The tool allows for customers to design the layouts and configurations of Ikea\u2019s couches, from the Vimle sectionals to the Vallentuna modular sofa series. Once it was discovered that the planner allowed for basically any configuration with no limit to the cost, it inspired some Sims-like creativity from users.\n\nAcknowledging the planner\u2019s full potential, Ikea worked with digital agency Proximity London to create the Soffa Sans font. Calling itself the \u201cthe world\u2019s comfiest font,\u201d Soffa Sans creates a typeface out of the Vallentuna couch in both isometric and bird\u2019s-eye view versions.\n\nthere are 2 types of people. those who walk to the center, and those who hop. pic.twitter.com/HDe8n8HPip \u2014 Morgan (Mostly Garbage, Partially 2 Day Old Bread) (@MeButInPogForm) June 23, 2019\n\nThe free font is downloadable here, and is available in white, blue, and gray colors. The Drum notes that Soffa Sans features 1,434 products, and would cost \u00a3106,320 (about $134,500) if the font were recreated in real life.", "description": "Ikea released a free font called Soffa Sans, inspired by its customers use of the Vallentuna couch planner.
