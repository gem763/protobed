It\u2019s not clear when Durham\u2019s inquiry shifted to a criminal investigation.\n\nDurham is examining what led the U.S. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and the roles that various countries played in the U.S. probe. He is also investigating whether the surveillance methods and intelligence gathering methods used during the investigation were legal and appropriate.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation shadowed Trump\u2019s presidency for nearly two years and outraged the president, who cast it as a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Mueller determined that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election, but his investigation didn\u2019t find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. Mueller also examined 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice and has pointedly said he could not exonerate the president.\n\nThe New York Times first reported that Durham\u2019s inquiry had become a criminal investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Trump recently made several calls at Barr\u2019s request to foreign leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, to help the attorney general with the Durham investigation.\n\nBarr also traveled with Durham to Italy in August and September, and the two met with Italian intelligence officials to seek information about the activities of FBI agents assigned there, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte said Wednesday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.", "description": "The Justice Department has shifted its review of the Russia probe to a criminal investigation, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday, a move that...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI659_barr05_ZG_20190501180927.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
