The Judiciary panel will call witnesses as part of its impeachment inquiry.\n\nDemocrats say they think Mr. Trump could be named as a co-conspirator in a case that had led to guilty pleas by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, though federal prosecutors declined to take the case further.\n\nCohen testified under oath that Mr. Trump had directed the payments he had made to the two women, which prosecutors said constituted an illegal campaign-finance contribution. Mr. Trump and his aides have given wildly varying statements about whether he knew about or even directed the payments.\n\nCongressional Democrats maintain that Mr. Trump would have been charged in that case also had it not been for longstanding Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\nThis, they maintain, puts the ball in their court.\n\n\u201cThe fingerprints are all over this one \u2014 it\u2019s not like a big mystery,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, Maryland Democrat and a panel member, told the Post. \u201cAs with the evidence of presidential obstruction of justice, the conclusion seems inescapable: that [Mr. Trump] would have been tried had he been anybody else. And now it\u2019s left to Congress again to figure out what to do with the lawbreaking and apparent impunity of the president.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also plan to investigate, the Post reported, whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice in the Cohen case, as they claim he did former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
