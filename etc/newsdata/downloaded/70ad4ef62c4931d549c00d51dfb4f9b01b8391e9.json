NHS doctors had pronounced she had no hope of recovery and asked the High Court to sanction letting her die.\n\nBut two weeks ago, in a legal victory that stunned the medical profession, a judge sided with the family \u2013 citing \u2018the sanctity of life\u2019 \u2013 and allowed them to transfer her to the Gaslini hospital in Genoa. Italian doctors told the family that Tafida could be back home in Newham, east London, \u2018in a year\u2019.\n\nShelina Begum kept a beside vigil after brain-damaged Tafida, five, started new treatment in Italy after she was airlifted there on Tuesday night\n\nMiss Begum said they are now no longer living with the suffocating fear that NHS doctors would switch off her life support. Locals in Genoa gave the family an extraordinary welcome after the case made Italy\u2019s national news.\n\nFollowing Tafida\u2019s flight from Britain in a medically-equipped jet, a traffic policewoman stopped her ambulance at the gates of the hospital to hand over a rose. Miss Begum and her husband Mohammed Raqeeb stood shoulder to shoulder with Italian medics at an emotional press conference held at the hospital to welcome them.\n\nMiss Begum said they are now no longer living with the suffocating fear that NHS doctors would switch off her life support\n\nMiss Begum said: \u2018We want to thank the Gaslini for believing in our daughter\u2019s recovery and thank the Italian public for the love and warm support they have shown us. The doctors in the UK believed from day one that Tafida wasn\u2019t going to make it.\n\n\u2018We were constantly reminded she would die the next week or next day. They simply didn\u2019t believe in Tafida. In Italy they believe in Tafida\u2019s recovery.\u2019\n\nMiss Begum, whose 40th birthday is today, said: \u2018A huge weight has been lifted from our shoulders. We had this constant fear in the UK that they were going to withdraw treatment.\n\n\u2018That is not going to happen here. It just doesn\u2019t exist here. That\u2019s the major difference.\n\n\u2018We saw her this morning, and she was stable, awake and turning her head from side to side. I have assured her that mummy and daddy are here. We are looking forward to her improving every day.\u2019\n\nSolicitor Miss Begum\u2019s voice cracked and she wiped away a tear as she told the Italian media: \u2018Tafida was a very happy child. She wasn\u2019t born unwell. This thing just suddenly happened. I\u2019m hoping, with time, she\u2019ll come to some sort of recovery \u2013 and that\u2019s the day we are waiting for.\u2019 Outside in the 20C sunshine, her construction consultant husband, 45, beamed and added: \u2018The sunshine tells a story. It\u2019s up to Tafida now.\u2019\n\nPaolo Petralia, director of the hospital \u2013 Italy\u2019s equivalent of Great Ormond Street, said: \u2018When Tafida\u2019s mother wrote to us in June we decided to help, and I put together a working group of doctors with different specialities who have studied her case.\n\n\u2018We have found a house for the family to live in nearby. Everyone in the hospital \u2013 and the people in the town as well, and the police \u2013 has been asking what they can do to help.\n\nMiss Begum and her husband Mohammed Raqeeb stood shoulder to shoulder with Italian medics at an emotional press conference held at the hospital to welcome them\n\n\u2018When she arrived at the hospital a traffic policewoman on the gate gave me a rose to give Tafida.\u2019\n\nDr Andrea Moscatelli, head of the neurological department, said Tafida would undergo a tracheostomy operation, saying: \u2018The idea is to make life more comfortable for her \u2013 take out the tubes from her mouth and let her breathe through a tube to her throat, and be fed through a tube to her stomach. We will give her time to get better. The objective is to transition her from intensive care to home care.\n\n\u2018We will teach the parents how to care for her at home. We have spoken to them very openly. Our assessment is exactly the same as the doctors in the UK, so we are not giving them false hope. But what we can give them is time.\n\nSolicitor Miss Begum\u2019s voice cracked and she wiped away a tear as she told the Italian media: \u2018Tafida was a very happy child. She wasn\u2019t born unwell. This thing just suddenly happened'\n\n\u2018After such a brain injury, nobody can say in just six months what is her potential for recovery. In the medical literature, you wait one year to see.\u2019 Tafida\u2019s family are funding her stay with public and private donations. They have applied for her to become an Italian citizen, which would reduce their bills.\n\nTheir local lawyer, Filippo Martini, said: \u2018After [the similar cases of] Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans, for the first time it has been decided that the best interests of a sick child allows them to be treated in a European hospital.\u2019\n\nHe said Alfie\u2019s father, Tom, was planning to visit Tafida in Italy.\n\nTafida had a seven-hour operation after the blood vessel burst in her brain. She was given a one per cent chance of survival before falling into a coma. She was then given 24 hours to live but opened her eyes after two weeks.\n\nThe family have raised around \u00a335,000 of a \u00a3400,000 target to fund their costs.", "description": "Miss Begum thanked Italian doctors for 'believing' in her stricken daughter's recovery.
