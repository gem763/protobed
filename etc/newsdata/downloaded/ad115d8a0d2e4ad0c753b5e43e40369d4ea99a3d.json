The best spaces should be reserved for people with the most expensive cars.\n\n\u201cIt is us who are likely to spend the most money in the supermarket, and to have the most shopping to carry back to our cars.\u201d\n\nAs Diana\u2019s entitled words quickly spread across social media with observers were unable to believe that such a person could exist. But the mystery doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nA person using the alias Diana Davenport has been a prolific author of letters to Melbourne newspapers for years.\n\nWhat\u2019s curious is how wildly her worldview seems to have changed of late.\n\nAre you Diana Davenport or do you know who is? Email shannon.molloy@news.com.au\n\nPranksters are nothing new in the world of letters to the editor, but Diana is a very different beast.\n\nFor a long time, the person behind the alias has expressed what appeared to be standard views about politics and social issues.\n\nBut in the past several months, Diana has veered into new territory with attacks on bogans and today\u2019s pearler about special privileges for wealthy shoppers.\n\nA search to track down Diana proved difficult as she has used many different contact details over the years.\n\nOne address she used actually belongs to the Toorak branch of the Returned and Services League of Australia. Another Bigpond email address is invalid.\n\nAnd of the two phone numbers used at various times, one is for a Melbourne primary school and the other for a confused gentleman who doesn\u2019t know a Diana.\n\nIf the name is familiar to you, chances are you\u2019re a fan of British television drama Midsomer Murders, a character who made one very memorable appearance in 2013.\n\nOne of her first letters in February 2015 was to congratulate then Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs for \u201cher courage and integrity in the face of ideological vitriol\u201d.\n\nIn the years that followed, Diana continued to send a steady stream of letters about Joe Hockey\u2019s exit from parliament, Tony Abbott\u2019s controversial revival of knighthoods and Uber surge-pricing during peak periods.\n\nYes; \u2018Diana\u2019 has been a serial letter writer to The Age for years! \u2014 Tracie Winch (@blardyblah) October 15, 2019\n\nLet's all go to Toorak early and take up all the good spaces. \u2014 \ud83d\udca7Niki Goodfellow (@nikgoodfellow) October 15, 2019\n\nDefinitely a pisstake on entitlement.\n\nAnd a pretty good one IMO. \u2014 Overlady (@Aitch_El) October 15, 2019\n\nTbh if I were filthy rich I\u2019d probably be that entitled too. \u2014 Carly Eastman \ud83d\udca7 (@carlyeastman) October 15, 2019\n\nShe seemed to skew left, attacking Mr Abbott\u2019s position on asylum seekers and even comparing him to US President Donald Trump when it comes to climate change scepticism.\n\n\u201cI note with horror that we taxpayers are to fork out $30,000 for a portrait to immortalise ex-Speaker Bronwyn Bishop,\u201d she wrote in March 2016.\n\nAnd in October that year, she quipped: \u201cSo Tony Abbott thinks he can be prime minister again. Of which country?\u201d\n\nBut then something unusual happened, when the correspondence took a turn and the normally reasonable and seemingly progressive Toorak resident started to take swipes at the less fortunate.\n\n\u201cYou know you\u2019re a bogan when you have four cars that are not mobile and a home that is,\u201d she wrote.\n\nA few months later on December 11, in a submitted letter that wasn\u2019t published, Diana took a shot at a charity initiative designed to bring a smile to the faces of sick kids at Christmas.\n\n\u201cI had the misfortune to be stuck in traffic gridlock caused by the motorcycle rider\u2019s Xmas Toy Run. I have never seen so many middle aged misfits with no teeth and tattoos,\u201d she wrote.\n\nPerhaps taking the rejection as a sign that Diana\u2019s character was pushing the envelope, the author returned to writing fairly down-the-line letters.\n\nShe expressed her dislike of Malcolm Turnbull and concerns about the controversial 457 visa.\n\nThen, in January 2018, fork-tongued Diana returned with this: \u201cThe only good thing about the one-day cricket at the MCG is that at least it keeps the bogans out of the CBD.\u201d\n\nThere were a few more letters about climate change denialists and the Adani coalmine up until Sunday when Diana submitted her now-viral whinge about parking spots for parents and kids at the expense of the wealthy.\n\nThe mystery continues.", "description": "A seemingly rich snob from one of Melbourne\u2019s most exclusive suburbs has shocked newspaper readers with her ghastly view about poor supermarket shoppers.", "authors": ["Shannon Molloy"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/53e9f479ca43079cc9dabf403a701aa5?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
