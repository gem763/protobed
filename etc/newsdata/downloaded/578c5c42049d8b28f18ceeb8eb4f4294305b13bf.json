Yes, we are living for it.\n\nNamed the Best Bad Boy at the recent Inside Soap Awards, Ben will be in the midst of a feud with the Panesars and will also drag Martin Fowler (James Bye) into the mess \u2013 with catastrophic results. But along the way, Ballum will continue to thrive much to the joy of fans as Max confirmed that the couple are still very much a \u2018thing\u2019 by Christmas time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it too much to ask for them to be wearing matching jumpers or are we getting a little too fanfic here?\n\nBen and Callum share a passionate kiss (Picture: BBC)\n\nSpeaking about the Christmas events ahead, Max exclusively teased to Metro.co.uk that the couple will be enjoying the festivities in each other\u2019s company.\n\n\u2018I would imagine so, yes,\u2019 he said in response to being asked whether they\u2019ll be celebrating together.\n\nSounds like our kind of EastEnders Christmas! But before all of that, Ben has the Panesars and Martin to contend with \u2013 and there will be intense scenes.\n\nMax added: \u2018The Panesars have come in now, so that drama there is definitely going to unfold. They\u2019re brave, they\u2019re boisterous, they\u2019re going to give Ben a run for his money.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018With Ben, it\u2019s 100 miles per hour all the time. At the moment, things are starting to take off again, things are nice with Ballum.\n\n\u2018Martin\u2019s just come back to the Square which is leverage for Ben to create this whole new drama.\u2019\n\nEastEnders swept up three other prizes from Inside Soap, including two comedy prizes for Danny Dyer (Mick Carter) and Lorraine Stanley (Karen Taylor) as well as a Best Young Performer for Kara Leah Fernandes (Bailey Baker).\n\nNot a bad night for Walford!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Bring it on!", "authors": ["Cydney Yeates", "Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ben-Callum-kiss-6157_1570481822.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
