Investors grew skeptical of President Donald Trump\u2019s Phase I trade deal after Chinese officials said they wanted another round of talks before committing the deal to paper.\n\nThe three major indexes\u2014 the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite \u2014 declined 0.1% each on Oct 14. Dow Jones hit 26,787.36 at the end of the trading session while S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at 2,966.15 and 8,048.65 respectively. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rose 10.5% to close at 13.95 on Monday. Finally, decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio.\n\nChina Wanted More Dialogue Before Signing Phase I Deal\n\nMajor indexes broke a three-day winning streak on Oct 14 after rising substantially on Oct 11. The primary reason behind this was the lack of clarity on the progress of the President\u2019s Phase I trade deal. While Trump noted that last week\u2019s trade talks in Washington were a success, China wants to hold another round of trade talks before signing the first phase of the deal. It is unclear where the trade talks might take place.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, China also wanted the United States to get rid of a tariff hike scheduled for December. After last week\u2019s trade talks were concluded, Trump said that both countries had reached a \u201cvery substantial phase one deal.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Phase I trade deal; China will purchase about $40 billion-$50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products and also address United States\u2019 concerns on intellectual property rights. In return, the United States has agreed to hold off a tariff increase scheduled for the week ending Oct 19.\n\nWhile Trump called the discussions \u201csubstantial progress\u201d, the Chinese state media underplayed the trade talks. In fact, the Chinese side appeared less interested in securing a deal without setting few key details straight first.
