Talk with this student activist for just an hour, and you'll walk away feeling empowered by her fearlessness when she says more people need to \"speak up and speak out.\"\n\nHer words come from a place of experience. Havana first made headlines in April 2018 when, as a first grader, she was the only student at Fort Hunt Elementary School in Alexandria, Virginia, to join the national school walkout in protest of gun violence in U.S. schools.\n\nHavana first gained national attention in 2018 when she was the only student at her D.C.-area elementary school to participate in the national walkout protesting gun violence. Courtesy of Leigh Vogel\n\nHer interest in advocating for gun control started after she attended the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., the month before. She watched then-11-year-old activist Naomi Wadler speak, which inspired Havana to want to use her voice, too.\n\nHavana told TODAY Style for our Groundbreakers series in honor of International Day of the Girl that, in the following weeks leading up to the national school walkout, none of her peers expressed an interest in participating despite her encouragement to do so. \"I was kind of sad about that,\" she said. \"But that's OK.\"\n\nAccording to Havana's mother, Bethany Edwards, Fort Hunt's principal also said the school didn't have enough staff to chaperone the students during a walkout. So Edwards signed Havana out of school so she could participate.\n\nI am all alone at my school, but I know I am not alone. #nationalschoolwalkout #columbine pic.twitter.com/1zozqfKIYw \u2014 Havana Chapman-Edwards (@TheTinyDiplomat) April 20, 2018\n\nThe day of the walkout, Edwards tweeted about Havana's solo protest. She included a photo of the then-7-year-old outside by her lonesome wearing an astronaut suit, an orange one in honor of gun violence awareness. \"I am all alone at my school, but I know I am not alone,\" the tweet reads.\n\nThe tweet took off from there, gaining attention in national outlets. According to Edwards, the viral tweet opened up a door to a network of other young activists. Among them was Naomi, the preteen who inspired Havana at the March for Our Lives.\n\n\"She was able to connect with so many amazing other students who were also passionate about gun laws,\" Edwards said. \"It changed her life. It changed the way she saw her ability to make change.\"\n\nIndeed it did. The attention led to amazing opportunities for Havana, including the chance to speak \u2014 in her orange astronaut suit \u2014 at a D.C. rally on National Die-In Day in June 2018.\n\nA few months later, in October 2018, Havana was photographed with other activists in TIME magazine's Guns In America issue.\n\nHer newfound notoriety also presented her with a bigger platform to speak out about other issues she cares deeply about. Havana, who's always been a globe-trotter as the daughter of a writer and a U.S. diplomat, has visited a dozen countries and encountered many people with varying socioeconomic backgrounds. She found girls across the globe all in need of a better education. And it starts with reading.\n\nWhen that tweet from her walkout went viral, Havana's GoFundMe raising money for her church choir's book club (the link to which was in her Twitter bio) climbed from $800 to more than $6,000 in 24 hours. The book club, called Rhymers Are Readers, has a specific mission: to read more stories featuring strong black characters.\n\n\"She has never felt it was someone else\u2019s job to make that difference,\" said Havana's mother, Bethany Edwards, about her daughter's passion for activism. Courtesy of Shattering the Silence\n\nThe fundraising didn't stop there. Havana teamed with Florida high schooler and fellow activist Taylor Richardson to raise $20,000 to buy books, toiletries, clothing and other supplies for girls at the St. Bakhita Orphanage in Ghana. And Havana is planning a return trip to Ghana this March.\n\n\"I wanted to help them (because) I want to them to grow up and reach their goals and dreams like I want to,\" Havana told TODAY.\n\nTheir efforts even got the attention of Misty Copeland, the professional ballerina who became American Ballet Theatre's first black female principal dancer.\n\n\"Parenting Havana since she could talk and walk, she has always been the person to look out for others,\" Edwards told TODAY. \"Because of our travels, she saw so much inequality, especially in girls who looked like her. So part of this feels like, of course this was going to happen, this was destined to happen, because she has never felt it was someone else\u2019s job to make that difference.\"\n\nAsk Havana what's she learned about this whirlwind of an experience, and she'll tell you what she proved from the start: \"Even if you\u2019re tiny, your voice is not. The world leaders need to listen to the little girls trying to make change.\"", "description": "Havana Chapman-Edwards, who went viral in 2018 for being the only student at her Virginia elementary school to join the National School Walkout, tells TODAY that she's fighting for a change.", "authors": ["Bryanna Cappadona"], "top_image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_40/1486749/day-of-the-girl-today-main-190926_2b1b30859e883398b24977e6e2134d29.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
