Obama also holds advantages over Romney in Ohio, Florida and Virginia: three of the most important Electoral College battlegrounds.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, The Hill\u2019s latest poll found Democrats are growing more confident and Republicans more pessimistic just five weeks before the election.\n\nSeventy-two percent of Republicans believe Romney will win the election, down from 76 percent in The Hill\u2019s poll on Sept. 2.\n\nBy comparison, 87 percent of Democrats now say Obama will win, up from 78 percent early in September.\n\nMore disturbing for Romney\u2019s campaign \u2014 and more encouraging for Obama\u2019s \u2014 is that far more centrist and non-aligned voters now feel the election is tilting in the president\u2019s direction.\n\nAmong centrists, 65 percent think Obama will win, compared to 31 percent who say Romney.\n\nA month ago, only 40 percent of centrist voters thought Obama would win; 44 percent picked Romney.\n\nA similar trend is evident among \u2018other\u2019 voters \u2014 those who identify as neither Republicans nor Democrats. The Hill\u2019s poll found 52 percent of those people think Obama will win, up from 36 percent in early September.\n\nObama is favored to win across all age groups, as well. Sixty percent of voters aged 18-39 think the president will get a second term compared to 36 percent who said Romney will win. The margin is narrower among voters aged 40-64 (48 percent said Obama, 45 said Romney) and those over 65 (48 percent said Obama, 46 said Romney).\n\nThe Republican has faced a barrage of criticism recently over his campaign\u2019s overall direction, much of it from conservative pundits who say the candidate has lacked focus and been too cautious in his attacks on Obama.\n\nThat Republican unease is reflected in the poll.\n\nWhile 84 percent of Democrats think Obama has run the better campaign, 73 percent of Republicans think their candidate has been more effective.\n\nBy a 2-to-1 margin (62 percent to 31), voters who identify themselves as \u201ccentrists\u201d say Obama and the Democrats have run a better campaign than Romney.\n\nThe view that Obama has outperformed Romney is particularly important because many polls have shown the president began the election with built-in challenges.\n\nHe received low marks for his handling of the economy and overall job performance throughout much of the year.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s poll on Sept. 2 found that 54 percent of voters said Obama, based on job performance, did not deserve to be reelected.\n\nDespite the struggles Romney has had connecting with voters, the latest Hill Poll found voters believe the former Massachusetts governor matches up well against Obama on a major character issue.\n\nWhen asked which candidate \u201cmost shares your values,\u201d 48 percent said Romney and 46 percent said Obama. That\u2019s similar to Hill Poll results from late July, when Romney led 48 percent to 44 on the same question.\n\nThe poll did not ask people which candidate they planned to vote for on Nov. 6.\n\nWith three presidential debates looming, however, the Hill Poll found a significant number of voters (9 percent) said they remained either somewhat or very likely to change their mind before election day.\n\nEighty-nine percent said they were not likely to change their minds.\n\nThe Hill Poll was conducted among 1,000 likely voters and is considered accurate within 3 percentage points.\n\nThirty-six percent of those polled identified as Republicans, 34 percent said they were Democrats and 30 percent had other or no political affiliation.\n\nClick here to view data from The Hill Poll.", "description": "A strong majority of likely voters now expect President Obama to win reelection, according to The Hill's latest election poll.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/obama-lede_9.jpg", "published_at": "2012-10-01"}
