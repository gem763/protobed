Identification of the vehicle \u2013 0.5% Source: DVSA\n\nHeadlamp issues were among the most common reasons for vehicles to fail the tougher MOT test in year one\n\nInitially when the tougher rules were introduced they had suggested that any vehicle with a dangerous defect would strictly not be allowed back on the road until the problem had been rectified.\n\nHowever, an increase in reports of vehicle owners claiming to have been held to ransom by garages, who told them they had no choice but to use their repair services - usually at inflated prices - because they legally were not allowed to drive the car away.\n\nThe DVSA has since said this is an advisory recommendation, though warns that drivers caught using vehicles listed to have outstanding dangerous defects will be fined up to \u00a32,500 and could be issued with points on their licence.\n\nNew checks as part of the MOT from May 2018 Stricter rules for diesel car emissions A vehicle will get a major fault if the MOT tester: \u2022 can see smoke of any colour coming from the exhaust \u2022 finds evidence that the DPF has been tampered with Other new checks include: \u2022 if tyres are obviously underinflated \u2022 if the brake fluid has been contaminated \u2022 for fluid leaks posing an environmental risk \u2022 brake pad warning lights and if brake pads or discs are missing \u2022 reversing lights on vehicles first used from 1 September 2009 \u2022 headlight washers on vehicles first used from 1 September 2009 (if they have them) \u2022 daytime running lights on vehicles first used from 1 March 2018 (most of these vehicles will have their first MOT in 2021 when they're 3 years old) Source: DVSA\n\nWhen we asked the DVSA to clarify the rule, MOT service manager, Neil Barlow, said: 'If a car has failed its MOT with a dangerous fault, DVSA's advice is that it should not be driven until the defect is repaired.\n\n'This is because it's dangerous to both the driver and other road users.'\n\nHowever, he then confirmed: 'Garages are unable to prevent owners from driving their cars away.\n\n'But they will provide advice to the owner on what they should do to keep the car safe.'\n\nThe first full-year results of the updated test showed that motorcycles had the highest pass rates of all vehicle types, with 83 per cent sailing through the MOT.\n\nClass 3 and 4 cars, vans and passenger vehicles with up to 12 seats had a 66.7 per cent success rate, while Class 5 motors (private passenger vehicles with more than 12 seats) were slightly higher at 70.3 per cent.\n\nWorryingly, it was the heaviest of all vehicle types - Class 7 vehicles that tip the scales between two and 35 tonnes - that had the highest failure rates, with just 40 per cent passing the test.\n\nWhile the DVSA said the test has successfully made Britain's roads safer, it said that around a quarter of vehicles get their MOTs late.\n\nAs a result there could be hundreds of thousands of dangerous vehicles overdue for their MOT.\n\nNeil Barlow added: 'DVSA's priority is helping everyone keep their vehicle safe to drive.\n\n'Thanks to the MOT, three million dangerous vehicles have been taken off the road.\n\n'But with a quarter of cars turning up late for MOT every year, that means there are lots of potentially dangerous vehicles badly in need of inspection.\n\n'We urge people to sign up to our free MOT reminder service so they get their MOTs done on time, helping keep Britain's roads safe.'\n\nDVSA said the introduction of stricter emissions checks as part of the MOT test have helped to reduce air pollution\n\nTest results for the year until 19 May 2019 showed that 31,285,618 vehicles had an MOT\n\nDVSA's data also showed that the new tougher emission tests introduced in May 2018 have also made a significant contribution to improving air quality.\n\nNearly 1.2 million (1,151,976) vehicles failed the MOT as a result of poor emissions.\n\nThese have been repaired or taken off the road, thus helping improve the environment, the government agency said.\n\nThe MOT is a once a year health check, but it does not guarantee that a vehicle is safe to driver for the entire 12 months after the test.\n\nNew research revealed this week that almost half of UK drivers believed they did not have to have their cars checked during the year because they thought an MOT was security enough.", "description": "A third of cars, van and motorcycles put through the annual assessment in the first year failed the test because of dangerous defects, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency has confirmed.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
