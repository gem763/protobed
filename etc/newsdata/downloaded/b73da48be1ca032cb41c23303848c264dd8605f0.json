He joined Fox News in 1996.\n\nThe anchor has gained attention in recent years for not being afraid to criticize the Trump administration. Smith has often been a target of President Donald Trump's tweets -- as recently as on Thursday.\n\n...Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nWatching Fake News CNN is better than watching Shepard Smith, the lowest rated show on @FoxNews. Actually, whenever possible, I turn to @OANN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2019\n\nFriday afternoon's episode of his show will be the final one, the network said.\n\nRichard Drew/AP, FILE\n\n\"Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News and begin a new chapter. After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged,\" Smith said in a statement. \"The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many. It's been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor. I've worked with the most talented, dedicated and focused professionals I know and I'm proud to have anchored their work each day -- I will deeply miss them.\"\n\n\"Shep is one of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry,\" Fox News President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace said. \"His integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put Fox News on the map, and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery.\"\n\nSteven Ferdman/Getty Images, FILE\n\nNews of Smith's departure seemed to have caught others at Fox News off guard. Video spread on social media of anchor Neil Cavuto visibly surprised, on-air, as he reacted to the news.\n\nShepard Smith's sudden departure definitely seems to have caught the rest of Fox News' staff off guard.
