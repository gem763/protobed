But sometimes the simplest choice is to visit the gym and take your pick of the cardio equipment there.\n\nWhich should you choose, and what should you do on it? One nice thing about these machines is that many of them have built-in programs, so you can just ask the friendly little computer on the bike or treadmill to surprise you for 20 minutes. Otherwise, just pick your favourite on/off scheme. (As we\u2019ve mentioned, one minute hard, one minute rest is easy to remember and tends to make for a good workout.)\n\nThe treadmill\n\nPick this if: You\u2019re wearing running shoes, and you like running or want to get better at it. Forget it if you want something lower impact, or if you\u2019re not used to running and can\u2019t figure out how to make it feel good.\n\nThe elliptical\n\nPick this if: You want to zone out and not think too much about what you\u2019re doing. This one is popular for a reason: it feels easy even when you\u2019re working fairly hard.\n\nThe bikes\n\nPick this if: You want to push really hard. Stationary cycling is great for sprints, and if it\u2019s a spinning style bike, you can turn the knob to adjust resistance quickly, without waiting for the machine to ramp up.\n\nThe stair climber\n\nPick this if: You want a serious quad workout. It\u2019s easy for this to be more of a strength than a cardio workout if you set the resistance to a too-difficult level. If you want to get through each interval without your legs feeling like they\u2019re on fire, be conservative in the settings and don\u2019t rely on leaning on the arm rails.\n\nThe rowing machine\n\nPick this if: you know how to use it. That\u2019s the first requirement. (We can help you in that department.) The major perk of this one is that it works your whole body, including arms and core, rather than just being for your lower body.\n\nLet us know: how do you like to do your gym intervals, and do you have a favourite specific workout you do on your machine of choice?", "description": "You can do cardio intervals just about anywhere, as we\u2019re discovering during this month\u2019s fitness challenge: your living room is a classic, or you can hop on a bike or lace up your running shoes.
