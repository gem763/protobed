That ends today.\"\n\nMichigan has joined a number of US states and cities taking steps to block the sale of e-cigarettes. In June, San Francisco became the first US city to ban sales of e-cigarettes and lawmakers in Boulder, Colorado, passed a similar ban last week.\n\nWhat's the reaction?\n\nNancy Brown, chief executive of the American Heart Association, called the measure a \"bold and appropriate\" response \"to the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use\", noting the recent outbreak in illnesses associated with e-cigarettes.\n\nImage copyright diego_cervo/Getty Images\n\nLast week, Juul - the market leader in e-cigarettes - said in a statement that it recognised youth vaping in the US was a \"serious and urgent problem\". The e-cigarette giant ended sales of most flavoured products in 2018 in an effort to deter teenage use of the product, and stopped sales to anyone under 21 years of age.\n\n\"We want to be the off-ramp for adult smokers to switch from cigarettes, not an on-ramp for America's youth to initiate on nicotine,\" the company said in a statement announcing the changes.\n\nDefenders of e-cigarettes called the Michigan ban misguided, arguing that e-cigarettes are much less unhealthy than cigarettes.\n\n\"This shameless attempt at backdoor prohibition will close down several hundred Michigan small businesses and could send tens of thousands of ex-smokers back to deadly combustible cigarettes,\" Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said in a statement.\n\nWhat's the bigger picture?\n\nAccording to the FDA, 34.3 million US adults and nearly 1.4 million young people in the US, ages 12-17, currently smoke cigarettes. Despite declines in cigarette smoking, tobacco use is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the US, killing about 480,000 Americans every year.\n\nThe battle surrounding e-cigarettes has been heightened by a recent spike in respiratory illnesses linked to e-cigarettes. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last month there were 193 \"potential cases\" of a mystery lung disease related to vaping across 22 US states. The possible cases include one death in Illinois, the first death linked to vaping.\n\nLast year, the FDA announced a series of enforcement actions against more than 1,300 retailers and five major manufacturers for catering vaping products to children.\n\nAccording to the American Lung Association, 97% of current youth e-cigarette users used a flavoured product in the last month, and 70% list flavours as a key reason for their use.\n\nIt says there are 15,000 flavours on the market, from mango and mint to cotton candy and gummy bear.", "description": "The chief medical executive for Michigan described youth vaping as a public health crisis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/89C7/production/_108617253__107524457_gettyimages-1044550250.jpg"}
