Introducing the 'Jeter-Ortiz Cup'", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE SportsPulse: The New York Yankees showed off their muscle in disposing of the Twins on their way to the ALCS. USA TODAY\n\nBaseball cherishes its history perhaps more than its happenings, embraces awards debates spanning months and occasionally years, and the last thing you\u2019d imagine it needs is another trophy.\n\nYet there is a gaping void in the game\u2019s honorifics, a prize to be had that better captures the most important month of the season than a World Series or League Championship Series MVP.\n\nIn short, baseball needs its own Conn Smythe Trophy.\n\nSure, it seems odd to take a page from hockey, of all sports, but the seemingly endless Stanley Cup Playoffs culminate in a cherished reward for the player who defined the previous eight weeks of play.\n\nBaseball\u2019s postseason is not similarly infinite, but perhaps you\u2019ve noticed it only gets longer, which has positive and negative consequences.\n\nGood: Nearly one month of playoff baseball is a significant onramp for narrative development, for the emergence of unlikely characters, and provides a large enough sample to define the most important player beyond just a guy who got hot for a week.\n\nBad: The sheer tonnage\u2013 the 2013 and 2017 playoffs saw 38 games played \u2013 can\u2019t help but dilute the impact of the World Series, the game\u2019s jewel event.\n\nOh, the attention and intensity it creates is unmatched, even if every Fall Classic isn\u2019t totally compelling. In the past five years, it\u2019s safe to say three of them (2014, 2016 and \u201917) were fantastic, with a pair of five-game duds (2015, 2018) mixed in.\n\nYANKEES: Chapman injures hand in ALDS celebration\n\nMLB 2019: Every team's regular-season MVP\n\nAnd too often, the World Series MVP is more the accidental tourist who ran into a few balls at key moments than the player that carried much more of the cargo through 12 to 20 games.\n\nSo let\u2019s carve out a new reward \u2013 call it the Jeter-Ortiz Cup, honoring the two players whose postseason exploits have defined the wild-card era (And if you don\u2019t think the numbers match the narrative, you can look \u2018em up).\n\nKeep in mind, the Jeter-Ortiz won\u2019t take anything away from anybody, but rather provide an additional lens through which to view the postseason \u2013 let\u2019s take 2018, for instance.\n\nKudos to Steve Pearce, whose three home runs in World Series Games 4 and 5 quelled any hopes for the Los Angeles Dodgers and vaulted him, narrowly, over pitcher David Price for World Series MVP honors.\n\nThere were others, though, who better defined the playoff run for the greatest team in Red Sox history. J.D. Martinez began the dominant run of 11 wins in 14 games with a booming three-run homer against the Yankees in the AL Division Series, and finished it with a home run off Clayton Kershaw, posting a .923 playoff OPS. Price shut down the Astros to finish the AL Championship Series, and then pitched three times in the World Series, including a Game 5 victory two days after pitching in relief.\n\nDerek Jeter and David Ortiz during a game at Fenway Park in 2006.

Yet that championship run was defined by CC Sabathia leading a trio of Yankee starters through the playoffs on three days\u2019 rest, as Sabathia posted a 1.98 ERA over five starts. He deserved some shine on that championship podium.\n\nAnd if the World Series MVP and the Jeter-Ortiz Cup go to the same player, all the better. Madison Bumgarner won the 2014 Series MVP, but that hardly captures a postseason that began with a four-hit throttling of the Pirates in the wild-card game. Over 29 remarkable days, he posted a 1.03 ERA in 52 \u2154 innings, held opponents to a .188 average and capped it with that unforgettable five-inning relief appearance in Game 7, on two days of rest after tossing another shutout.\n\nGive that man the World Series MVP, the J.O.C. and the thoroughbred of his choice to canter back to North Carolina.\n\nThe award would be a wise acknowledgement that modern playoff baseball is nothing like what came before it. It\u2019s a month so vast that Clayton Kershaw can rack up a pair of wins in the 2017 NLCS, follow up by throttling the Astros in a seven-inning, 11-strikeout World Series Game 1 performance \u2013 and still get pilloried for his postseason performance after a poor start in Game 5.\n\nSandy Koufax is the standard Kershaw can never reach, but you know how many career postseason starts Koufax made?\n\nSeven \u2013 a total Kershaw nearly equaled in 2017 alone, when he started six games and relieved in World Series Game 7. Just a guess, but we might remember Koufax a bit differently if he had to navigate three rounds of playoffs.\n\nSo let\u2019s get real and acknowledge that times have changed, and that the World Series is no longer the singularly defining postseason moment.
