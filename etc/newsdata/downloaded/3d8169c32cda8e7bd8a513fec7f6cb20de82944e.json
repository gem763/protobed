HU!! HU!!,\u201d yelled the crowd, at escalating volume, for a full 20 minutes before the Hu kicked off their recent concert at the Brooklyn venue, Warsaw. The fans who packed the place, many of whom were decked out in de rigueur heavy metal gear of black T-shirts and leather, thrust their fists into the air in rhythm to their chants, which grew to a roar the moment the band appeared.\n\nHow Horrorshow\u2019s world turned upside down: \u2018It\u2019s the kind of news that usually stops your life\u2019 Read more\n\nThe imposing-looking members of the Hu sported leather too, only theirs bore the elaborate patterns and symbols of their homeland, Mongolia. And instead of singing in English, they sang exclusively in their native tongue, delivered in the ancient art of khoomei, or throat singing. In the same vein, their instruments mixed the slashing electric guitars and pounding drums of the west with the richness of the morin khuur (a two-stringed, horse-head fiddle), the tinniness of the tuvshuur (a Mongolian guitar) and the quaver of the tumor khuur (a jaw harp). The beat they kept didn\u2019t so much punch, a la western metal, as gallop, a reference to the horses prized by the nomadic tribes of the band\u2019s ancestors. With so bracing a combination of sights and sounds, the Hu have been forging a highly improbable connection between the complexities of traditional Mongolian music and the 10-ton force of western metal. Think: Genghis Khan ransacking Judas Priest.\n\n\u201cOur music is a blend of east and west, old and new,\u201d said Galbadrakh Tsendbaatar, AKA Gala, the band\u2019s lead singer, through a translator. \u201cWe\u2019re building on a history and a sound that has been around for thousands of years.\u201d\n\nNever before, however, has that sound had the impact in the west it\u2019s currently enjoying, courtesy of the Hu. Their first two videos, for Wolf Totem, and Yuve Yuve Yu (or How Strange, How Strange) have amassed more than 45m views on YouTube over the last year, while their debut album, The Gereg, opened at No 1 on Billboard\u2019s Top New Artist chart and No 2 on the magazine\u2019s Indie Label chart. Likewise, it hit No 2 on the UK\u2019s Rock & Metal Album chart and No 4 on the Album Downloads list, while in Australia it broke the top five in overall digital sales. The Hu\u2019s Facebook page has more than 300,000 followers.\n\nThough the band only formed in 2016, their members have been playing their instruments and practicing the tricky rituals of throat singing for most of their lives. The four core members \u2013 who also include Enkush (Enkhsaikhan Batjargal), Jaya (Nyamjantsan Galsanjamts) and Temka (Temuulen Naranbaatar) \u2013 received formal training at the Mongolian State Music and Dance Conservatory in their country\u2019s capital city, Ulaanbaatar. There, they absorbed a wide variety of music. \u201cEverything from western classical music to jazz to rock and, of course, a lot of traditional Mongolian music,\u201d said Gala.\n\nAlong the way, the musicians enjoyed a steady diet of metal, via Metallica, System of a Down and Rammstein. Such music from the west had been banned during the communist era of Mongolia, which ended in 1992. Though the band members were just children then, they remember the cultural upheaval well. \u201cWe had to go through hardship,\u201d said Jaya. \u201cThe country fell into a financial crisis. But it was something we had to do and, because of that change, we are all able to play rock music.\u201d\n\nIn fact, over the last two and a half decades, a significant contemporary music scene has developed in Ulaanbaatar, fleshed out by lots of local pop groups, (such as boy band Camerton), rock acts (like Altan Urag, whose music was featured in the Netflix series Marco Polo), and hip-hop artists (such as breakout star Mrs M, who will soon record in English). Even so, no one had the notion to translate credible, metallic rock to traditional Mongolian styles before B Dashdondog (AKA Dashka), the producer who formed the Hu. After years of working with local pop and rock groups who simply imitated western sounds, Dashka wanted to forge something fresher. So, he hand-picked the members of the Hu from the Conservatory to fulfill his vision. The band say they didn\u2019t choose their name as a play on the Who\u2019s, but because \u201chu\u201d is the root word for human being in Mongolian. \u201cWe took the name because of the inclusive nature,\u201d Temka said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being Mongolian. It\u2019s about being human.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Mongolian themes dominate the band\u2019s lyrics. Many salute their ancestors. \u201cAs Mongolians, we are raised to have a great respect for our elders and our history,\u201d said Jaya. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here by ourselves. There are generations of people who paved the way.\u201d\n\nImportant, too, in the band\u2019s lyrics is a sensitivity to nature. \u201cHuman beings and nature are connected,\u201d said Jaya. \u201cAnd, as nomadic people, we have cattle and we have to move all around so we don\u2019t destroy the land. We respect it.\u201d\n\nAs Jaya explained, there\u2019s an essential connection between nature and the intent of throat singing. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is imitate the sound of the water, and the sound of the wind,\u201d he said. \u201cNature is right in our voices.\u201d\n\nWhile all the members long ago mastered the art of throat singing, it remains a difficult skill to learn. With khoomei, a single vocalist can produce two, or even three, notes at once by forcing air through a tightened throat. The guttural sound that the technique produces can remind western listeners of the dark cries of thrash singers. \u201cBoth put a lot of force on your throat,\u201d said Jaya. \u201cIt creates a very energetic sound.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s video for Yuve Yuve Yu likewise stresses the connection between modernity and tradition. It opens with various band members in contemporary settings \u2013 an upscale coffee shop in Ulaanbaatar, or at home playing a video game \u2013 before Gala opens the door of his urban apartment to enter a vast expanse of mountains and lakes in Mongolia\u2019s remote western region. The images that occupy the rest of the video are so stunning, they could double as a travelogue for the Mongolian tourist board. The band\u2019s second video, for Wolf Totem, unites traditional Mongolian horse riders with leather-clad men on Harleys, suggesting an eastern take on Easy Rider. That connection underscores a bad-ass image that has made the band a natural for metal heads. The smash success of their two videos inspired a rash of labels to woo the band before they even completed their first album. They settled on Eleven Seven Music, home of metal acts from M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce to Five Finger Death Punch.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the amount of views of their videos that attracted us,\u201d said Steve Kline, chief operating officer of Eleven Seven. \u201cIt was the fact that their sound is completely unique. We couldn\u2019t even put a label on what they do. We just found ourselves saying, \u2018we\u2019re not exactly sure what this is. But it\u2019s really good.\u201d\n\nThe Hu\u2019s debut, which the label released last month, took its name from something the Mongol Empire introduced to the world, the first diplomatic passport, which dates from the 1200s. \u201cPeople think of the Mongol Empire as just warlords and warriors,\u201d said Jaya. \u201cBut there are so many positive things the empire brought to the world, like the first postal system, the first international trading on the Silk Road and the diplomatic pass.\u201d\n\nThe Hu\u2019s music has become its own passport. Their current American tour has sold out more than half of its dates, and they\u2019ll take their show to Europe at the end of the year and the UK at the start of 2020. For the live dates, they add four auxiliary members to the core foursome, making their sound even more forceful. For another lure, Eleven Seven has begun marketing remixes of their songs featuring cameos from a rash of American rockers, singing in English. The first, for Yuve Yuve Yu, boasts a guest vocal from Danny Case of the rock band From Ashes to New. All the exposure has even helped the Hu attract kudos from some big-name stars. \u201cThe other day, Elton John told me he\u2019s a big fan of ours,\u201d Gala said. \u201cHe told us it\u2019s been many years since he has heard something this fresh in music.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s good news for rock itself, given the fact that the genre is now often considered an old sound that\u2019s past its peak. \u201cWe love rock,\u201d Gala insisted. \u201cBut people have never heard it sound like this before. That\u2019s why it\u2019s connecting. It\u2019s something new.\u201d", "description": "Combining \u2018a blend of the east and west\u2019, the Hu have found their way to 45m YouTube views, a smash hit debut album and the admiration of Elton John", "authors": ["Jim Farber"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ad344663c735ac3420480ac2609d52a68a847a8/0_231_3077_1846/master/3077.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9a2ea852fe219ce7436cf4b04fbfaa12", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
