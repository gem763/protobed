That\u2019s right, Joe. Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), remarks during the third Democratic presidential debate, Sept. 12, 2019\n\nSanders made this comment after former vice president Joe Biden criticized the senator\u2019s Medicare-for-all plan for potentially adding \u201c$30 trillion, $3.4 trillion a year\u201d to the federal budget. In his response, Sanders favorably compared that $30 trillion to what he called the \u201cstatus quo\u201d for health-care spending \u2014 $50 trillion. He added: \u201cEvery study done shows that Medicare-for-all is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman and child in this country.\u201d\n\nThe implication was that Medicare-for-all would reduce national health expenditures from the \u201cstatus quo.\u201d When we queried the Sanders campaign during the debate for the source of the $50 trillion figure, we were directed to posts that were written by Paul Waldman for The Washington Post\u2019s \u201cThe Plum Line,\u201d an opinion column.\n\nWaldman compared a government projection that national health spending would amount to about $50 trillion over the next decade to an estimate that projected the federal cost of Medicare-for-all as $32.6 trillion. In one column cited by the campaign, Waldman wrote: \u201cSo if Medicare-for-all actually costs $40 trillion, we would save $10 trillion. Hooray!\u201d\n\nWaldman told the Fact Checker he has not read academic studies that looked closely at the impact of a Medicare-for-all plan on national health expenditures. All but one of five major studies, from the left to the right, predict the Sanders plan would increase health spending, not reduce it.\n\nDuring our reporting for this fact check, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign said it was not endorsing Waldman\u2019s analysis but was simply supplying a source for the $50 trillion figure that Sanders cited in the heat of the debate. But he declined repeated queries to explain the point Sanders was making with his comparison.\n\nThe Facts\n\nWe will try not to get too much in the weeds, but this debate involves some big, confusing numbers.\n\nThe $50 trillion figure comes from an estimate of national health expenditures (NHE) produced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the years 2018 to 2027.\n\nThe \u201cover $30 trillion\u201d refers to a 2018 study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which has been funded by entities associated with the Koch family, that calculated new federal spending on health care if the Sanders plan were enacted. The number $32.6 trillion is often used, but the study actually offers a possible range of $32.6 trillion to $38.8 trillion for the years 2022 to 2031.\n\nNote that the $50 trillion and the $30 trillion involve different 10-year time frames and thus are not directly comparable.\n\nThe Sanders campaign has cited this study to claim his plan would lower health-care costs, but the author, Charles Blahous, has publicly and persistently insisted the campaign has misinterpreted his findings. In particular, he says the \u201clower-bound\u201d estimate is unrealistic because it assumes Sanders would be successful in reducing payments for treatments now covered by private insurance by 40 percent.\n\nRoughly speaking, there are two parts of the $50 trillion in national health expenditures that would be affected by a Medicare-for-all plan: $17 trillion in current government spending on Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare and the like, and $26 trillion in spending by households, employers and states. (Another $7 trillion would not be affected.) Medicare-for-all would essentially take over the state, employer and household spending, so that\u2019s the key variable.\n\nUsing the same time frame (2022 to 2031) so we can compare apples to apples, the \u201cstatus quo\u201d for health expenditures in the 10-year period covered by the Mercatus paper would be $59.7 trillion. Under the Mercatus range of estimates, total health expenditures under Medicare-for-all would be $57.6 trillion to $63.8 trillion over 10 years. On average, that\u2019s slightly higher than under the current path.\n\n\u201cBottom line is that it is incorrect to say that the plan is cheaper than current law, even on a national basis,\u201d Blahous said. \u201cMost of the range of possible outcomes would have total NHE increasing under Medicare-for-all. The increase occurs primarily because of the increase in the numbers of those covered as well as in the generosity of coverage, both of which would spur additional demand and, other things being equal, additional spending.\u201d\n\nThe Mercatus study is not the only detailed look at the potential impact of a single-payer plan on federal spending. In a 2016 report, the Urban Institute said that federal spending would increase by about $32 trillion between 2017 and 2026 and national health expenditures would increase by $6.6 trillion on top of the status quo in that period.\n\n\u201cThe increase in federal spending is so large because the federal government would absorb a substantial amount of current spending by state and local governments, employers, and households,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn addition, federal spending would be needed for newly covered individuals, expanded benefits and the elimination of cost sharing for those insured under current law, and the new long-term support and services program.\u201d\n\nKenneth Thorpe, chairman of the health policy department at Emory University, in a 2016 study also predicted an increase in spending, as did a Rand Corp. study in 2019 led by Jodi L. Liu.\n\nThorpe, a skeptic of the Sanders plan, said he was surprised when Sanders made the comparison during the debate. The two figures are \u201capples and oranges and not comparable,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMedicare-for-all would increase the dollars paid by the federal government, if private premiums are largely eliminated and new taxes are established to fund a national single-payer system,\u201d Liu said. \u201cHow this impacts national health expenditures depends on a variety of assumptions. In our RAND report, we projected a 1.8 percent increase in national health expenditures if Medicare-for-All was implemented in 2019.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times Upshot earlier this year helpfully illustrated the impact envisioned by the five studies \u2014 Mercatus, Urban, Rand, Emory and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst \u2014 for national expenditures under Medicare-for-all, compared to current law. Only one of the five studies showed a significant decline.\n\nThat study, by Gerald Friedman, an economics professor at UMass-Amherst, found health spending would decline over a 10-year period from a baseline of $46.8 trillion in health spending between 2019 and 2029 under six scenarios. The most optimistic model, assuming Americans shared some costs with the government, shows a decline in spending to about $34 trillion, or 28 percent. But a model with no cost-sharing \u2014 Sanders\u2019s plan envisions no out-of-pocket spending except for prescription drugs \u2014 would have national health expenditures of nearly $41 trillion, or a decline of 13.2 percent.\n\n\u201cBernie is overstating things,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cEven with optimistic assumptions about savings realized and a slowdown in growth to Canadian or European growth rates and an actuarial value of 87 percent (not the 96 percent in his program), spending would not decline by $20 trillion, or 40 percent. I am perfectly comfortable in saying that there will be financial savings, savings over-and-above the improvements in health that would come with greater access and improvements in financial stability with universal quality insurance. The benefits of Medicare-for-all are substantial enough that there really is no need to exaggerate.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nSanders implied during the debate that his Medicare-for-all plan would reduce health-care spending compared to the \u201cstatus quo\u201d of $50 trillion over 10 years. His use of the \u201cmore than $30 trillion\u201d figure might have led listeners to assume he was comparing the two figures. Certainly that\u2019s how the authors of these studies interpreted these comments.\n\nThat might have been a logical assumption. During the debate, his staff shared, as the source of the $50 trillion figure, a pair of Washington Post opinion columns that made a similar comparison. But a spokesman has since said that the campaign was not endorsing the analysis in those columns. Instead, he says Sanders was simply pointing to a government estimate for health expenditures over a 10-year period.\n\nSince the spokesman declined to explain why Sanders made the comparison, we are left with a conundrum. It certainly sounded as if he was saying his plan would reduce health-care spending from $50 trillion over 10 years to $30 trillion, even though most studies predict spending will increase. The Washington Post columns originally cited as a source also framed the issue that way.\n\nWe can understand a misfired talking point in the heat of a debate. Regular readers know that we always offer the opportunity to politicians to explain that he or she made an error and then we leave the claim unrated. We don\u2019t try to play gotcha and simply want to inform readers about the facts. (For instance, in response to our queries about a fact check, Biden recently admitted he misspoke about his opposition to the Iraq War.) Similarly, we offered multiple opportunities to the Sanders campaign to explain his statement or acknowledge an honest mistake. The campaign did not respond to that request.\n\nOn balance, as uttered during the debate, the statement is mostly false. Four of the five key studies on the impact of the Sanders plan estimate that national health expenditures will rise over 10 years, while the author of the fifth predicts a decline but says Sanders\u2019s statement is exaggerated.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "During the third Democratic debate, Sanders suggested his health-care plan would lower health-care costs significantly compared to the \"status quo.\" Most studies say his plan will raise costs.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jLK7z86p9ZL0wdsfOT3iOqcKKRA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GHUD7OWWBQI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
