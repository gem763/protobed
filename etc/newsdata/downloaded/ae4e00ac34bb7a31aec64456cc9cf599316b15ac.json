Outside the team hotel, workers tore down enormous banners advertising the game, according to a Reuters news agency witness.\n\nSilver said on Tuesday that the league supported Morey's right to exercise his freedom of expression, further angering authorities and some fans in China and threatening the NBA's business there, said to be worth more than $4bn.\n\nMorey deleted the tweet and apologised on Monday, but Chinese broadcasters, sportswear companies and sponsors have said they are reviewing their ties with the NBA, which has had a presence in China since 1992.\n\nClash of world views\n\nThe NBA initially described the anger over Morey's post as \"regrettable\", drawing criticism from politicians in the US, who accused the league of putting its China business ahead of free speech.\n\nSilver, speaking in Japan before a preseason game between the Houston Rockets and Toronto Raptors, said it was not up to the league to regulate what players, employees and team owners said.\n\nOn Wednesday, an editorial in the official English-language China Daily accused Silver of \"brazenly endorsing Morey's secessionist-supporting tweet\" and giving \"a shot to the arms of the rioters of Hong Kong\".\n\n\"If Silver thinks endorsing the indiscriminate violence the radical Hong Kong protesters are resorting to ... is supporting freedom of expression, then he should think again,\" it said.\n\nThe protests were \"a bid to liberate the city\" and \"a secessionist pipe dream\" peddled by demonstrators \"to justify their summer hooliganism,\" the editorial added.\n\nThe protests were sparked by opposition to a now-scrapped bill allowing the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China, but have evolved into broader calls for democracy.\n\nThe protesters are not demanding secession or independence, however.\n\nSome fans in China expressed dismay at the way the controversy had spread, while voicing their support for Beijing's view.\n\n\"I'm patriotic of course. I support that Hong Kong is part of China, but I just don't understand this,\" said Yu Jie, a fan waiting to see the players in Shanghai.\n\nThe basketball furore also comes against the backdrop of the US-China trade war, which escalated after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials on Tuesday.\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper, accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with disregard.\n\n\"Tweeting something offensive to the Chinese people before a series of NBA promotional activities in China only shows a lack of intellect, respect, and responsibility,\" it said.\n\nFallout\n\nBasketball is the most popular sport in China, with about 500 million people consuming NBA content. The league has deals with TV and digital media outlets across the country, and teams have played exhibition games annually since 2014.\n\nNBA China, launched in 2008 to run the league's business, is now worth more than $4bn, according to Forbes magazine.\n\nThe NBA had planned media events in Shanghai ahead of the Nets-Lakers game, but Chinese organisers cancelled an event at a Shanghai school on Tuesday and an open training session with the Nets on Wednesday.\n\nState television dropped plans to air the NBA exhibition games in China this week, saying a country's sovereignty and social stability were \"not within the scope of freedom of speech\". China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong.\n\nSome Chinese fans have asked for streaming subscription refunds from exclusive service provider Tencent, which halted broadcast of Houston Rockets games after the Morey tweet.\n\nTencent is not the only company distancing itself from dealings with the NBA.\n\nOnline travel agency Ctrip said on Tuesday it had stopped selling tickets to NBA games and NBA-related tour packages. Smartphone maker Vivo and sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd have also stopped working with the NBA.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms Alibaba and JD.com appeared to have taken Houston Rockets merchandise such as sneakers off their sales platforms including mobile apps as of Wednesday night.\n\nBut the escalating row did not seem to bother some waiting outside Shanghai's Ritz-Carlton hotel to catch a glimpse of the NBA players.\n\n\"Personal opinions belong to them. It doesn't affect us chasing the stars,\" Xu Ziyang, a university student from Jiangsu, told Reuters.", "description": "The furore surrounding a tweet supporting protesters in Hong Kong has strained Chinese relations with the NBA.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/4c2b052b2787430d95e2f5f5890177d1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
