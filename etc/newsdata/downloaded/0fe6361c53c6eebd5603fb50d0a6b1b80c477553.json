We make personal choices like driving an electric car or going vegan and recycling and we think that that\u2019s enough. And it\u2019s great and we need to keep doing it. But this is a collective crisis that needs collective action now,\u201d said the actress in a video shared by the organization on social media.\n\nMore from WWD\n\nFonda moved to Washington for four months \u201cto focus on climate change,\u201d to protest alongside the organization. The protests began Friday morning, and Fonda\u2019s arrest along with others is an intentional demonstration.\n\nThe organization recently received the award for policy leadership at the United Nations Champions of the Earth gala held in New York in September.\n\nAt the gala, the young activist attendees, many of whom sported their own business cards and organizational involvement, professed a distaste for the pedestal placement of their teen counterpart: Thunberg.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need another celebrity,\u201d Azalea Danes, the 17-year-old activist who was invited by Patagonia to the dinner and gala, told WWD. \u201cWe need action.\u201d Danes is a member of the Fridays for Future initiative, as well as the U.S. and local youth chapter of Extinction Rebellion. Her parents are Robert Alexander Danes and Rachel Hall Danes of the Bergdorf Goodman-carried luxury women\u2019s wear line The Danes.\n\nWhen asked about Friday\u2019s incident, Kathleen Rogers, president of the world\u2019s largest environmental movement Earth Day, also based in Washington, said she wasn\u2019t aware it happened but had previously received numerous e-mail requests suggesting Fonda as a speaker at the mall on Earth Day at the organization\u2019s upcoming 50th anniversary.\n\nCelebrity activism doesn\u2019t end with Fonda \u2014 Alec Baldwin, Leonardo DiCaprio and, from the fashion industry, Stella McCartney, Vivienne Westwood and Mara Hoffman have taken to the front lines to protest.\n\nThe fashion industry is no longer a bystander to climate inaction, and the Global Fashion Agenda\u2019s 2019 update to its Pulse of the Fashion Industry report produced with the Boston Consulting Group warned that if the fashion industry does not implement changes at a faster rate, it will not be able to achieve the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals or that of the Paris Agreement.\n\nFor More Sustainability News, See:\n\nTeen Activists Rally Against Climate Change, \u2018Cheap\u2019 Fashion\n\nAs Climate Change Takes Center Stage, Brands Step Up Efforts to Fight It\n\nNike Athletes Tackle Climate Change\n\nBest of WWD\n\nSign up for WWD's Newsletter.
