A number of industry observers have been typically disparaging, calling it a manipulated pump and dump but as yet markets are holding steady.\n\nBitcoin Predicted Pullback\n\nAfter any huge surge, there will be a pullback, price does not move in a straight line and these dips are expected. Charts by Tradingview.com show that BTC made another move towards five figures yesterday but resistance was too strong there.\n\nBTC subsequently moved back into the mid-$9,000 range but a larger red candle a few hours ago dropped prices to $9,200. Bitcoin is currently trading just above this at 00.\n\nAll losses this month have now been recovered and BTC appears to be back in bullish territory. Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee pointed out that there have been a lot of positive signals over the past few days, adding;\n\nA lot of \u2018signal\u2019 past few days in crypto and #bitcoin \u2026 Interim \u2018risk-off\u2019 ended, and bull market resumes.\n\nA lot of \u2018signal\u2019 past few days in crypto and #bitcoin \u2013 China (friendly policy) \u2013 New ATH S&P 500 (positive) \u2013 Bitcoin Misery Index bottomed 10/24 at 36 and rebounding (positive) \u2013 Massive price gain on $BTC friday (signal) Interim \u2018risk-off\u2019 ended, and bull market resumes. \u2014 Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) October 28, 2019\n\nWhile the \u2018China effect\u2019 does not directly relate to Bitcoin since it is still banned there, it is positive for the industry in general. Major global players are now looking at blockchain and cryptography which will raise awareness of decentralized digital assets.\n\nWhale Manipulation or Sour Grapes?\n\nOthers are not convinced, such as gold bug Peter Schiff who has recently warmed a little on bitcoin. Schiff claims that China had nothing to do with the rally and it was just whales manipulating prices.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent sharp rally likely had nothing to do with China, or any fundamental factor. It clearly looks like market manipulation by whales looking to sucker in momentum buyers. By pumping up a technically weak market, they are able to dump more #Bitcoin at higher prices.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent sharp rally likely had nothing to do with China, or any fundamental factor.

The most balanced response came from co-creator of Unity Protocol, Joshua D. Tobkin, who stated;\n\nI actually think it\u2019s not that they are dumping at higher prices. Actually imho whales are manipulating, dumping and then snatching it up again. I believe it is an accumulation technique actually, not the other way around.\n\nRe-buying at lower prices after selling higher is a good way to accumulate more BTC without injecting more fiat. The fact that nearly every Chinese based altcoin surged even higher than BTC and blockchain stocks are pumping today still points the finger at the red dragon as the catalyst.\n\nEither way, over $50 billion went into crypto markets over the past few days and most of it is still there so the dump hasn\u2019t materialized just yet.\n\nWas the bitcoin rally manipulated by whales?
