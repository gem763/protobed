Another quoted national security adviser John Bolton as calling Giuliani a \u201chand grenade\u201d for his back-channel efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s Democratic rival Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nOn Wednesday, a former aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived to speak to the House impeachment panels behind closed doors. Michael McKinley, who resigned last week, is a career foreign service officer and was Pompeo\u2019s de facto chief of staff.\n\nHe is expected to discuss concerns held by career State Department officials about the treatment of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and others who worked on the Ukraine portfolio, according to a person familiar with his testimony. A Latin America specialist, McKinley wasn\u2019t directly involved in Ukraine policy, but as a senior adviser to Pompeo was generally aware of the situation, the person said.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters outside the closed-door hearing that McKinley was complimentary about Pompeo\u2019s role but did raise other issues.\n\n\u201cI think most of this is a concern by a colleague for an ambassador that he held in high regard,\u201d said Meadows said, declining to provide more details of the closed session.\n\nMcKinley was expected to talk about demoralization in the ranks of career foreign service officers and what many have lamented as the politicization of the once-apolitical bureaucracy, according to the person, who was granted anonymity to speak about his remarks.\n\nThe 37-year veteran of the diplomatic corps was known to be unhappy with the state of affairs although his farewell note to colleagues mentioned nothing about the reason for his departure other than it was a \u201cpersonal decision.\u201d\n\nAnother key figure in the impeachment investigation, special envoy Kurt Volker, returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday. He and his lawyer were to review the transcript of his Oct. 3 testimony to investigators, according to a person familiar with his appearance who was not authorized to discuss it. Republicans say all the transcripts from the investigation should be released to the public.\n\nVolker provided text messages to lawmakers that revealed an effort at the State Department to push Ukraine\u2019s leader into opening an investigation of the gas company Burisma, connected to Joe Biden\u2019s son, in return for a visit with Trump.\n\nThat effort soon escalated into what one diplomat feared was a quid pro quo for U.S. military aid. Trump has denied that, saying assistance to Ukraine was delayed to pressure the country into addressing corruption.\n\nThe testimony so far from the witnesses, mainly officials from the State Department and other foreign policy posts, is largely corroborating the account of the government whistleblower whose complaint first sparked the impeachment inquiry, according to lawmakers attending the closed-door interviews.\n\nTrump\u2019s July 25 phone call in which he pressed Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens is at the center of the Democrats\u2019 inquiry.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, despite intensifying calls from Trump and Republicans to hold a formal vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry, showed no indication she would do so. She said Congress will continue its investigation as part of the Constitution\u2019s system of checks and balances of the executive.\n\n\u201cThis is not a game for us. This is deadly serious. We\u2019re on a path that is taking us, a path to the truth,\u201d Pelosi told reporters after a closed-door session with House Democrats.\n\nDemocratic leaders had been gauging support for a vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry after Trump and Republicans pushed them for a roll call. Holding a vote would test politically vulnerable Democrats in areas where the Republican president is popular.\n\nTrump calls the impeachment inquiry an \u201cillegitimate process\u201d and is blocking officials from cooperating.\n\nTrump and congressional leaders will be meeting later Wednesday at the White House on other matters.\n\nThe inquiry is moving quickly as a steady stream of officials appears behind closed doors this week, some providing new revelations about the events surrounding the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It is on that call that Trump urged Zelenskiy to investigate a firm tied to political rival Joe Biden\u2019s family and Ukraine\u2019s own involvement in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the Intelligence Committee overseeing the probe, has praised the State Department officials for stepping forward, under subpoena, to shed light on the matter.\n\n\u201cWe have learned much of this thanks to the courageous testimony of the State Department officials who have been put in an impossible situation by the administration,\u201d which is urging them not to comply with requests to testify to Congress, he said. \u201cThey are doing their duty.\u201d\n\nCareer State Department official George Kent testified Tuesday he was told by administration officials to \u201clay low\u201d on Ukraine as \u201cthree amigos\u201d tied to the White House took over U.S. foreign policy toward the Eastern European ally.\n\nKent was concerned about the \u201cfake news smear\u201d against Yovanovitch, whom Trump recalled in May, according to emails obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nKent told the lawmakers that he \u201cfound himself outside a parallel process\u201d and had warned others about Giuliani as far back as March. He felt the shadow diplomacy was undermining decades of foreign policy and the rule of law in Ukraine and that was \u201cwrong,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va.\n\nConnolly said Kent described a May 23 meeting at the White House, organized by Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, where three administration officials \u2014 U.S. ambassador Gordon Sondland, special envoy Kurt Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry \u2014 declared themselves the people now responsible for Ukraine policy.\n\n\u201cThey called themselves the three amigos,\u201d Connolly said Kent testified.\n\nKent also told them that Trump, through the Office of Management and Budget, which Mulvaney previously led, was holding up military aid to Ukraine while pressing Zelenskiy to investigate a company linked to Biden\u2019s son.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller, Michael Balsamo, Eric Tucker, Matthew Lee, Padmananda Rama, Andrew Taylor and Alan Fram in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in Dallas contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The House impeachment inquiry is exposing new details about unease in the State Department and White House about President Donald", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/76a26e_trump-impeachment-47922-michael-mckinley-michael-mckinley-top-aide-secretary-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
