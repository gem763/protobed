Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThis year seems to be a bumper crop for malls: Jewel Changi Airport, Funan Mall, and now Paya Lebar Quarter (PLQ).\n\nThe mall, which sits right beside Paya Lebar MRT, cost Australian developer Lendlease S$3.6 billion to build. The firm is also behind Parkway Parade, JEM, and 313 Somerset.\n\nPLQ, which held its soft opening on Aug 30, is home to the first Singapore outlet of two famous overseas eateries: Mom\u2019s Touch (from Korea) and Fong Sheng Hao (from Taiwan).\n\nI attended a tasting at both outlets, then subsequently returned to check out the food as a paying customer.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went:\n\nPaya Lebar\u2019s newest mall, PLQ, just opened last week.\n\nThe new mall is already drawing crowds (as expected), but two eateries in particular are enjoying exceptional popularity.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe first one is Mom\u2019s Touch, a fast food chain with over 1,200 stores in South Korea.\n\ncaption The brand is franchised here by the No Signboard Group. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nLocated on the first floor of PLQ, the menu is currently focused on chicken, although a rep said it is looking at bringing in beef and garlic-flavoured items.\n\ncaption They might also have some Singapore-exclusive dishes in the future. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe chain is known for its fried chicken, which is prepared by hand and marinated with a special seasoning that\u2019s supposed to make it taste \u201cfuller, tender and juicier\u201d.\n\ncaption source Lendlease\n\nFried chicken is also used in the brand\u2019s signature chicken thigh burger, which comes with onions, pickles, lettuce, and mayo.\n\ncaption source Lendlease\n\nDuring the media tasting, I got to try a piece of fried chicken thigh.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m not a fan of deep fried chicken, this place might have converted me. The chicken was far less greasy than other brands, and the cornflake-like breading made the skin crunchy and light.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nI braved the queues and returned another evening to try the burger. It took one hour to order, find a seat, and (longest of all) for the food to be ready.\n\ncaption The chain admitted that its service isn\u2019t the fastest, but makes up for it in quality. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe wait was worth it. I liked the burger even more than the chicken thanks to the veggies, sauce and bread, which provided texture and balanced out the jelak feeling of fried food.\n\nThe fries were crisp on the outside and fluffy in the middle, while the soda wasn\u2019t too sweet and came with popping boba.\n\nHowever, the burger and fries serving felt small for the price (S$8.20). It could be that my appetite had increased after waiting so long, but I wasn\u2019t full after eating.\n\ncaption P.S: One of the burgers isn\u2019t mine. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nAnother famous outlet in the mall is Michelin-approved Fong Sheng Hao, which sits in Basement 2.\n\ncaption The interior was designed to look like a retro breakfast cafe. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe Taiwanese brand is known for its authentic charcoal-grilled toast.\n\ncaption source Lendlease\n\nIt\u2019s especially proud of its bread, which is made with anhydrous milk fat, a form of butter.\n\nThe recipe was invented by the founder\u2019s family, which runs bakeries in Taiwan.\n\ncaption Unlike supermarket bread, this baby doesn\u2019t sink even if you press it down hard. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nSadly, the chocolate and peanut toast options served at the tasting were incredibly underwhelming.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe black tea and milk tea fared better. The drinks were made with sugar cane syrup, which gave them a complex sweetness.\n\ncaption The syrup is made by boiling freshly peeled sugar cane stalks overnight. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nI returned another night at almost 9pm to skip the queues and try a savoury toast option.\n\nBy that time, everything had sold out except the pork, egg and cheese toast (S$6.30).\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nI had zero regrets. The toast had a solid, slightly chewy feel, the buttery soft omelette went well with the warm, melty cheese, and the thin slice of pork patty gave the sandwich a salty kick.\n\nDespite its deceptive size, the sandwich was rather filling.\n\nCombined with a cup of milk tea, this would make an amazing breakfast or supper option \u2013 one I would absolutely queue up for.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Say yes to fried chicken and charcoal-grilled toast..
