REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is considering former Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to handle its communications for the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump, a person familiar with the deliberations said on Friday.\n\nThe two were top contenders for the job of coordinating the White House response and messaging on the Democratic-led impeachment effort in the U.S. House of Representatives, the person told Reuters on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump has pressured Republicans to adopt a more robust defense in recent days after two of the president\u2019s recent decisions - the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and the now-reversed move to hold a G7 summit at one of his Florida resorts - drew criticism from members of his party.\n\nWhite House adviser Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, was leading the search. There was no timetable for an expected announcement.\n\nThe impeachment probe focuses on Trump\u2019s request in a July 25 telephone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate a domestic political rival, Joe Biden, the former vice president who is a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination to face Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nU.S. election law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.\n\nRepublican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on Thursday that the White House is working on getting a team together to handle impeachment communications.\n\n\u201cI talked to chief of staff Mulvaney. I think they\u2019re working on getting a messaging team together,\u201d Graham said at a news briefing, referring to White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.", "description": "The White House is considering former Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to handle its communications for the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump, a person familiar with the deliberations said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444892536&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O18D", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
