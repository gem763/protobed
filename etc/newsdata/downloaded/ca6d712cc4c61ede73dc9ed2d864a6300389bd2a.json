It\u2019s also related \u2014 albeit more distantly \u2014 to a bacteria that causes Lyme disease.\n\nARE YOU PUTTING YOURSELF AT RISK FOR LYME DISEASE?\n\nBorrelia miyamotoi disease is most often caused through the bite of an infected black-legged tick, also known as the deer tick. Deer tick can also cause Lyme disease.\n\nBorrelia miyamotoi bacteria has also been found in Western black-legged ticks, per the CDC.\n\nDr. Kris Paolino, an infectious disease specialist at Upstate, told Syracuse.com that the risk of Borrelia miyamotoi disease is currently low but noted the potential for more cases is \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatients describe a syndrome that sounds very much like Lyme disease, but there are no rashes,\u201d Paolino said. \u201cThe symptoms are more severe, with higher fever and more severe headaches.\u201d\n\nSpecific blood tests help medical professionals determine if a patient is infected with the disease, according to the CDC, which noted it\u2019s treated with antibiotics, typically doxycycline, amoxicillin or ceftriaxone.\n\nLast year, the New York State Department of Health collected 7,600 ticks and found Borrelia miyamotoi bacteria was present in less than 1 percent, per Syracuse.com.\n\nUK MOM BITTEN BY LYME DISEASE-CARRYING TICK DEVELOPS 'BULLSEYE RASH,' WARNS OTHERS ABOUT COMMON SIGNS OF ILLNESS\n\nBut Bryon Backenson, the deputy director of Communicable Disease Control at the New York State Department of Health, worries it could spread.\n\n\u201cIt seems that with each passing year we get a few more ticks that are positive\u201d for miyamotoi, Backenson, echoing Paolino, said. \u201cIf history is any indication, it\u2019s one of those things that will expand and spread, and there may be more and more ticks infected as time goes on.\u201d\n\nThe best way to prevent the disease is to protect yourself against ticks. Such measures include the use of insect repellents, staying out of high grass and wooded areas, wearing protective clothing and checking yourself for ticks.", "description": "A tick-borne disease that can reportedly cause symptoms more severe than those associated with Lyme disease has been found in Central New York, according to a local report.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
