But the outcome was anti-climactic: A witness took no offense and the park official, P. Daniel Smith, and the other employee involved acknowledged that the vaguely off-color episode was inappropriate for a workplace. It appears no disciplinary action was taken.\n\nLittle harm, no foul. Welcome to the humdrum, day-to-day operations of the federal government\u2019s inspectors general, independent offices within executive branch agencies that answer to Congress by law.\n\nDepartment of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz has a lot of consequential work on his plate. Inconsequential work, too. It's a government thing.\n\nWhile national headlines focus on blockbuster IG reports like the Justice Department\u2019s just-released one on former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s transgressions, or its highly anticipated inquiries into the Trump-Russia affair and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s death in prison, the work of the federal watchdogs often tends toward routine business full of petty gripes and fury -- signifying nothing or not much.\n\nSure, the news media perk up when a White House staffer is found to have had sex on a government rooftop, or when Medicare is found to have wasted prodigious taxpayer sums, again. But much IG work is like Freedom of Information Act requests: typically non-newsworthy efforts that burden government departments \u2013 yet are considered a necessary bureaucratic cost of transparency and accountability. Are the watchdogs a bargain? Currently, there are 73 IGs, one for most every federal department, with a collective annual budget of about $2.5 billion.\n\nSome call them toothless tigers. But IGs represent consumer retail democracy for better or worse, with a lot of apparently unavoidable waste built in.\n\nFrom one Inspector General's website.\n\nEvery IG has a hotline \u2013 a general term for the phone numbers and email addresses by which anyone within the government or without can lodge complaints. And tens of thousands people do, often anonymously. Between October and March 2019, for example, the Social Security Administration\u2019s IG received 161,000. Each of those has to be screened and vetted before a full-fledged investigation into the complaint can be green-lighted.\n\nAt the Interior Department, the process includes \u201cspecial agents and analysts who interview complainants, review documents, and make recommendations,\u201d said Nancy DiPaolo, director of external affairs for Interior\u2019s IG.\n\nSometimes complainants have no idea who they\u2019re calling. \u201cWe\u2019ve even gotten sewer complaints,\u201d said an official in the General Services Administration\u2019s IG office. But officials offer this common refrain: \u201cWe take everything very seriously.\u201d\n\nNumbers of complaints ebb and flow, and appear to be up in some departments. In prior comparable periods, Social Security tended to get between 30,000 and 50,000 hotline complaints, not the more than triple those numbers it\u2019s seen more recently. Between April and September 2018, Interior\u2019s IG office, which has about 265 employees, received 1,126 complaints \u2013 about six complaints a day. But it opened only 37 full-scale investigations \u2013 including the hallway \u201curination\u201d claim. In prior periods, Interior got closer to 500 complaints.\n\nComplaints vary from department to department and, as with Interior\u2019s, most are not deemed to merit full investigations. Often, they are referred to other IGs under whose jurisdiction they properly fall.\n\nOfficials reason that without the hotline system, important allegations would go unreported. \u201cIt also allows complainants, who may be hesitant to report wrongdoing for fear of retaliation, to report their concerns anonymously,\u201d said an official at GSA.\n\nAnd unsubstantiated investigations are \u201cjust part of the job,\u201d said DiPaolo. It is not a concern that the anonymous hotline encourages frivolous allegations, she noted, \u201cbecause that\u2019s the point of either vetting things or actually investigating them.\u201d DiPaolo did not comment on how allegations are vetted.\n\nMany cases are, of course, serious and even criminal. In one, a woman who had sold land through an Interior Department program said she\u2019d never gotten her check. When the Inspector General investigated, it turned out that she\u2019d simply lied to get another check.\n\nIn fact, after she filed her claim, the government found out that the check had been cashed. Later, she pleaded guilty in Montana to mail fraud and was sentenced to two years of probation.\n\nIn another Interior case, the IG confirmed that an employee \u201clied about her cancer diagnosis, forged medical records, falsified documents, and abused her own sick leave and leave donated by coworkers.\u201d There was no evidence that the employee had cancer, and she forged medical notes to take leave.\n\nUnsubstantiated allegations, on the other hand, are often a result of miscommunication, grievance and \u201che said, she said\u201d situations, said Kathryn E. Newcomer, director of the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy & Public Administration. When IGs look into such allegations, \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that they could go either way.\u201d\n\nFor example, if a female supervisor fires a male employee, he might feel gender discrimination was the cause and make an allegation.\n\nIn a recent case, a biologist at the National Park Service was accused of coercing at least two interns into sex. But the IG found no evidence of such misconduct.\n\nAccording to DiPaolo, complaints of federal workers viewing pornography at work, often played up in the media, are not taken lightly. Last year an investigation found that an employee allegedly caught looking at Ukrainian porn sites was involved in exposing more than usual; he was \u201cexposing systems to foreign hackers.\u201d\n\nStill, IGs could probably reduce the number of unsubstantiated cases, said James Bovard, an investigative journalist who\u2019s researched inspectors general, \u201cif they had a higher standard of evidence prior to launching an investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should probably have some very solid stuff before you pull someone in for questioning,\u201d he said.\n\nYet experts including John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, believe that the substantial number of investigations that come up with nothing shouldn\u2019t be a big concern. \u201cIf every OIG investigation turned up something wrong, it would probably suggest that an IG is only taking the slam-dunk cases,\u201d he said.\n\nCorrection\n\n3:55 PM Eastern, August 29, 2019\n\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of the investigative journalist quoted.
