The 250-km (155-mile) DMZ is also home to wild animals that thrive in the wooded no-man\u2019s land.\n\nThe animals may be deterred by fences and other barriers along the DMZ, the military official added.\n\nThe U.S.-led United Nations Command (UNC), which helps oversee the DMZ, is not involved in containing the virus, the official said. The UNC did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe efforts against the highly contagious disease, which is fatal to pigs but does not affect humans, have taken on new urgency as more cases are reported.\n\nThe wild boars trapped by the military have tested negative for African swine fever, the military official said. Two boars found dead in the DMZ had also tested negative, the defence ministry said.\n\nSouth Korea has deployed 1,173 military personnel and 166 decontamination vehicles to seven areas, deputy defence ministry spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere have been no cases of wild boars crossing the border from North to South within the DMZ,\u201d he told a news briefing. \u201cNo attempt was made to enter general outposts and no boars have been shot dead inside the DMZ.\u201d\n\nMore than 300 South Korean soldiers and 40 decontamination trucks were deployed along roads and checkpoints near the border on Thursday to control the spread of the virus, Roh said.\n\nSouth Korea has been disinfecting people, cars and equipment at a liaison office jointly run with the North in the border city of Kaesong, said an official at the Unification Ministry, which handles cross-border ties.\n\nDMZ \u201cpeace trails\u201d used by hikers have also been closed.", "description": "South Korea has ordered hundreds of soldiers manning the demilitarized zone (DMZ) on its border with North Korea to track and capture wild boars in a bid to prevent the spread of African swine fever, military officials said.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
