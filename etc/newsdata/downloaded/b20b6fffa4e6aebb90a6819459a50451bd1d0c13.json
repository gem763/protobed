Mendez.\u201d At the time, officials claimed the cartel operators were willing to lay down their arms. However, according to Milenio, after word of those meetings became public, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ordered Peralta to halt further discussions.\n\n\u201cWhen you met with them, what where the terms of your negotiations and in exchange of what,\u201d Lopez Rabadan questioned Cordero in the video. \u201cBecause we find it very suspicious that the President canceled the topic if you were, as you say, only going to promote productive projects. You [Madame Secretary] say one thing and the undersecretary does another. In Tamaulipas, they clearly warned the undersecretary that these are not self-defense groups, they are organized crime groups and even then, this government that you represent met with them.\u201d\n\nThe questioning of federal officials by PAN leaders comes at a time of great controversy where senators from the ruling party MORENA recently called for the removal of the Tamaulipas governor, claiming that cartel violence was out-of-control there. The talking points presented by MORENA senators come from a cartel-connected human rights activist from Nuevo Laredo who has a long history of defending members of Los Zetas. The activist claimed state police officers kidnapped and murdered innocent civilians in order to dress them as cartel gunmen for a staged shootout scene.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
