And 8 million suffering New Yorkers.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio, New York City\u2019s mayor since 2014, launched his White House campaign in May, joining a crowded pool of candidates competing for the Democratic nomination to compete next year against President Trump. He failed to make a splash in the months since, however, consistently polling poorly among voters and failing to qualify to participate in the most recent Democratic primary debate.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve contributed all I can to this primary campaign, and it\u2019s clearly not my time,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said Friday on MSNBC. \u201cI\u2019m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I\u2019m going to keep speaking up for working people.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio did not immediately comment on the Post front page. A message seeking his reaction was sent to the campaign.\n\nMr. Trump similarly mocked Mr. de Blasio after he withdrew from the race Friday, saying the mayor \u201cwas polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth.\u201d\n\nTen candidates participated in the third and most recent Democratic primary debate held this month: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Sen Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Amy Klobuchar, former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and businessman Andrew Yang.\n\nCandidates have until Oct. 1 to meet the criteria needed to participate in the fourth Democratic debate, currently scheduled to take place two weeks later in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
