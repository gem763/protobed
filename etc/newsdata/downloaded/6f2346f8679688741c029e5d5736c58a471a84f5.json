Photo: Alain Jocard/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, the Swedish Academy awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature to Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk and Austrian playwright and novelist Peter Handke. The rare double award came after the academy punted last year, in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct and embezzlement, for the first time since World War II.\n\nTokarczuk, officially the winner of the 2018 prize, was a predictable and reasonably safe choice (with solid odds in the U.K. betting markets). Handke, taking the 2019 award for \u201can influential work that \u2026 has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience,\u201d was another story \u2014 his name is associated with hard-right nationalism as much as literary posterity. After last year\u2019s Nobel scandal, which led to the imprisonment of Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a member of the Swedish Academy, and the departure of numerous Nobel Committee members, the recognition of Handke\u2019s work brought swift backlash online and in the press.\n\nThe Nobel committee decides to dig itself out of scandal by awarding this year's Nobel prize in literature to an Austrian defender of Milosevic who denies that the Srebrenica massacre happened.\n\n\n\nWay to read the times, Nobel committee \ud83d\ude44https://t.co/laYvRWUt0w \u2014 Molly McKew (@MollyMcKew) October 10, 2019\n\nHandke\u2019s polarizing reputation stems primarily from his relationship with the late Serbian president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, a nationalist war criminal who was imprisoned for ordering ethnic cleansing and genocidal killings during the Bosnian War. Handke gave an infamous eulogy at the president\u2019s funeral, following his death in a Hague prison cell, and once called the politician \u201ca rather tragic man. Not a hero, but a tragic human being. I am a writer and not a judge.\u201d\n\nAnyone covering Peter Handke's Nobel Prize in Literature who doesn't mention the fact that he went to the funeral of Slobodan Milosevic -- after being asked to testify in his trial at the tribunal for the fmr Yugoslavia -- is an offense to journalism. https://t.co/Ia0zaHIY7Q \u2014 Una Hajdari (@UnaHajdari) October 10, 2019\n\nThe Nobel\u2019s extended citation for Handke, acknowledges the controversy, but quickly distances both him and the committee from it: \u201cAlthough he has, at times, caused controversy he cannot be considered an engaged writer in the sense of Sartre, and gives us no political programs.\u201d But the idea that the academy is apolitical would be news to anyone who\u2019s ever hoped to be on its list. It\u2019s long been believed that Philip Roth missed out on the prize (which is only awarded to living writers) as a result of his perceived regressivity on gender and objectification of women. The real news is that its choice this year leaned too far to the right.\n\nWhat an utter shame! The @NobelPrize has disgraced itself - again - in awarding the Literature Prize to #PeterHandke ... the man who gave a glowing eulogy at the funeral of mass war criminal Slobodan Milosevic! https://t.co/HuaCT02Ccy \u2014 Arsen Ostrovsky (@Ostrov_A) October 10, 2019\n\nAccording to the Guardian, the academy had hoped to depart this year from \u201cmale-oriented\u201d and \u201cEurocentric\u201d winners (15 out of the 115 laureates are women). In recent years it\u2019s tacked in novel directions, awarding Svetlana Alexievich in 2017 \u2014 a journalist and oral historian but not a fiction writer or poet \u2014 and, of course, the marginally literary Bob Dylan in 2016. So Handke is in many ways a return to form.\n\nCompounding outrage with irony is the fact that in 2014, Handke himself told an Austrian newspaper, \u201cThe Nobel prize should finally be abolished,\u201d calling the prize a \u201cfalse canonization\u201d of literature. (Slovenian Marxist Slavoj \u017di\u017eek told the Guardian that their choice of Handke \u201cproves that he was right.\u201d) Interviewed on-camera this morning by Agence France-Presse, Handke said, \u201cI\u2019m not a winner. My nature is not the nature of a winner.\u201d When a reporter asked what the award meant to him, he replied, \u201cFreedom\u2026 as if I were \u2014 which is not the true \u2014 as if I were innocent.\u201d\n\nPeter Handke is the Bob Dylan of genocide deniers. \u2014 Sasha Hemon (@SashaHemon) October 10, 2019\n\nThough a Swedish Academy spokeswoman has declined to comment on the committee\u2019s decision-making in response to several news outlets, PEN America issued a statement expressing \u201cdeep regret\u201d over their decision: \u201cWe are dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth and offer public succor to perpetrators of genocide.\u201d\n\nPerhaps next year the academy can award a nationalist who might be a little more grateful \u2014 and give the Peace Prize to President Trump in return for securing \u201cvictory for the world.\u201d", "description": "After a year off due to a #MeToo scandal, the Committee awarded its 2019 prize to Austrian genocide apologist Peter Handke.
