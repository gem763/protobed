The U.S. Coast Guard said it has launched several boats to help over two dozen people \"in distress\" off the coast of southern California. (Ventura County Fire Department via AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Latest on a dive boat on fire off the coast of California (all times local):\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nPolice have interviewed the five crew members who survived a boat fire off the Southern California coast.\n\nThe Coast Guard says 39 people were aboard the Conception, a dive ship on a three-day scuba diving excursion to the Channel Islands. There was a six-member crew and 33 passengers when the fire broke out about 3 a.m. Monday and quickly engulfed the boat.\n\nFive crew members survived after jumping overboard and making it to a nearby boat. It's unclear what efforts they made to help the passengers.\n\nEight bodies have been found and 26 people missing.\n\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown says police have interviewed the men but didn't disclose what they said. No cause for the fire has been identified and Brown says at this stage there's no reason to believe it involved a criminal act.\n\n___\n\n4:20 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say four more victims of a catastrophic dive boat fire have been located on the ocean floor off Southern California, bringing the known death toll to eight.\n\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown says the additional victims were found Monday close to the sunken vessel but the boat remains unstable and it's uncertain when those remains will be recovered.\n\nFour unidentified bodies recovered earlier Monday are those of two men and two women.\n\nCoast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester says the search for more than two dozen other missing persons will go on into Tuesday morning but that but people should be prepared for \"the worst outcome.\"\n\n___\n\n2:05 p.m.\n\nA scuba diver who has frequently gone on expeditions on the boat where a deadly fire broke out Monday says it and others in its operator's fleet are among the safest and best maintained he's seen.\n\nFour people died and 29 are missing after flames erupted on the Conception, which later sank anchored just off Santa Cruz Island. Five crew members who were on the boat's top deck managed to escape.\n\nDave Reid, who runs an underwater camera business with his wife, said the boat's operator, Truth Aquatics, has immaculate boats and its crew is top notch.\n\nBut Reid, who is familiar with the boat's configuration, notes all divers sleep on the lowest level.\n\nHe says divers are not locked into that level but if a fire erupted above them it would be difficult for any to escape through a narrow stairway.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nThe boat with 33 passengers aboard that burned while anchored close to shore of one of Southern California's Channel Islands had no recent safety violations.\n\nThe Santa Barbara-based Conception was carrying recreational scuba divers and caught fire early Monday. Five crew members jumped to safety but all 33 passengers were missing. Four bodies were later recovered and the search for others continued Monday afternoon.\n\nCoast Guard records show inspections conducted last February and in August 2018 found no deficiencies. Earlier inspections found some safety violations related to fire safety.\n\nA 2016 inspection resulted in owners replacing the heat detector in the galley and one in 2014 cited a leaky fire hose.\n\nRecords show all safety violations from the last five years were quickly addressed by the boat's owners.\n\n___\n\n11 a.m.\n\nThe Coast Guard says four bodies have been recovered near a dive boat that caught fire off the California coast with dozens of people aboard.\n\nLt. Cmdr. Matthew Kroll says the bodies recovered Monday morning had injuries consistent with drowning.\n\nSearchers are continuing to look for 29 other people who were aboard the vessel Conception, which burned while anchored off Santa Cruz Island.\n\nFive crew members were awake when the fire broke out and were able to jump into the water. They were rescued by a passing pleasure craft.\n\nAuthorities have given fluctuating information about the number of people aboard the vessel. The Coast Guard now says a sixth crewmember who was on the manifest was actually not aboard.\n\n___\n\n9:35 a.m.\n\nA fire official says there are confirmed fatalities as rescue crews continue their search after a boat caught fire off the coast of Southern California.\n\nVentura County Fire Capt. Brian McGrath tells The Associated Press that they have confirmed \"some fatalities\" after Monday morning's fire near Santa Cruz Island. He would not provide a specific number.", "description": "Police have interviewed the five crew members who survived a boat fire off the Southern California coast.
