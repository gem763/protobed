I didn\u2019t quite imagine that happening as quickly as mid-January, but here we are. Ripple, the fintech startup behind the controversial XRP token, has its first investment after it backed U.S.-based storage startup Omni through a $25 million round.\n\nOmni was founded in 2015 as a storage option for those with limited space at home \u2014 ideal for the Bay Area where it is based \u2014 and this year it began to allow people to rent their stored items out to others.\n\nThat isn\u2019t exactly an obviously match for Ripple \u2014 which helps banks use the blockchain via software services \u2014 but that hasn\u2019t stopped the company from striking a undisclosed \u201cbusiness deal\u201d with Omni. Ripple didn\u2019t invest directly in this round, to be clear \u2014 instead executives Stefan Thomas (CTO) and Chris Larsen (executive chairman and co-founder) took part alongside existing Omni investor Highland Capital Partners. Thomas and Larsen invested via an undisclosed amount of XRP for the round, which Omni said closed in December.\n\nThe funds will go towards a second city expansion in the second half of this year and hiring. \u201cThis funding is another step we\u2019re taking to make our vision a global reality,\u201d CEO Thomas McLeod said.\n\nOmni had raised $14.75 million in traditional investment to date. It isn\u2019t exactly clear why the startup has gone down the crypto route at this stage but you\u2019d imagine that the Ripple deal is strategic in nature.\n\nUnfortunately, imagine is all we can do since neither company is being forthcoming with details.\n\nOmni said it is \u201cnot disclosing at this time\u201d the exact details of its alliance with Ripple.\n\nA spokesperson declined to comment when TechCrunch asked whether Omni plans to hold an ICO. (XRP is a token that could be swapped for an ICO coin.)\n\nThe spokesperson also declined to comment when asked if Omni has plans to use XRP within its service.\n\n\u201cOmni is creating a way to move physical goods frictionlessly from one person to another. In many ways, it\u2019s similar to what we\u2019re doing at Ripple for global money transfers, where we want money to move as fast \u2013 and frictionlessly \u2013 as information,\u201d Thomas, the Ripple CTO, said in a prepared statement.\n\n\u201cThis is a first-of-its-kind deal which alters the traditional funding landscape, and we\u2019re excited to be a part of it,\u201d added Highland Capital Partners\u2019 Manish Patel.\n\nRipple announced an incentives program last October which pledged to disburse $300 million in XRP to financial institutions that use the token. The value of XRP has increased over five-fold since then, giving Ripple an even more powerful war chest. It doesn\u2019t have a specific program for developers or startups yet, Ripple\u2019s global head of infrastructure innovation told TechCrunch in a recent interview.\n\nA system may not be in place but this deal shows that Ripple is actively sizing up potential partners outside of the financial world.\n\nThe move to invest crypto in startups makes plenty of sense when you consider that companies which have raised large ICOs are typically flushed with (digital) cash and keen to develop ecosystems around their technology. Putting money to work through investment in startups with synergies is already standard for companies like Slack, Google and Amazon, so why not apply it to the crypto world, too.\n\nA more valid question, perhaps, is why Ripple is making friends outside of the core banking audience that it draws its revenue from?\n\nToday\u2019s announcement comes the week after Ripple announced a tie-in with cross-border payment service MoneyGram. MoneyGram, which was subject to a failed acquisition by Alibaba\u2019s Ant Financial unit, said it has agreed to pilot XRP within its payment flows using Ripple\u2019s xRapid product.\n\nRipple has attracted criticism for misleading partnerships with financial organizations, which has seen XRP\u2019s valuation soar. It reached a record-high of $3.65 per coin earlier this month which briefly made it the world\u2019s two largest cryptocurrency based on total coin market cap. That price represented a huge surge from $0.006687 one year prior.\n\nA recent New York Times article published explained that more than 100 banks use Ripple\u2019s software, but MoneyGram and Mexican money transfer business Cuallix are its sole XRP customers. Financial industry sources cited by the Times expressed skepticism that any banks would adopt XRP.\n\nRipple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, refuted those claims and claimed new customer wins would be announced soon.\n\nDisclosure: The author owns small amounts of cryptocurrency", "description": "Earlier this month, I wrote that crypto companies are going to become investors in 2018.
