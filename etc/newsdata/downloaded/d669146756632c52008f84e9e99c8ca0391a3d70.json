In documents submitted to the court, the UK government indicated it could try and prorogue parliament again, but for lawful reasons.", "description": "In a devastating blow to Boris Johnson's authority, the Supreme Court ruled that his decision to shut down parliament before Brexit was unlawful.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7843/1c1a9818bd7744fdab32ca94453a0140.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
