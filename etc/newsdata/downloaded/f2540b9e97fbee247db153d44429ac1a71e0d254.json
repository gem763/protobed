It is instructive that the coaching staff he\u2019ll be joining will probably be the greenest in South African Super Rugby history.\n\nProbable head coach Ivan van Rooyen, having been a conditioning coach just two seasons ago, has coached only 16 first-class games since his surprise appointment to coach in the Currie Cup last year, while probable defence coach, Sean Erasmus, was coaching schools rugby just a year ago.\n\nShould SA Rugby director of rugby Erasmus go ahead and name Nienaber as his successor to safeguard the continuity of his philosophy and alignment, the former physiotherapist won\u2019t even have been a head coach.\n\nThere was a time when a potential coaching appointment had to jump through the hoops of what he had won. Now it seems like any track record \u2013 be it as a player or a backroom staffer \u2013 has become a path to the head coach position.\n\nGiven the assumption that recent former players are up to speed with modern trends in the game, the cash-strapped state of South African rugby and the fact that the coaches who do shave, figuratively speaking, prefer to do it from the comfortable confines of a Randburg studio, one can understand the juniorisation of the local coaching landscape.\n\nBut this fails to take into account the legendary players who have failed to make the transition work (think Martin Johnson with England), and it certainly doesn\u2019t explain the undocumented criteria that encourages rugby administrators to increasingly put their faith in unqualified \u2013 let alone untested \u2013 coaches.\n\nThe fact that black coaches and baggage masters never seem to get the same gut-feel benefit of the doubt \u2013 or leap of faith \u2013 that is reserved for their white counterparts in these calls is a column for another day.\n\nBut it speaks volumes about a system based less on metrics than on personal relationships and preconceived notions about what coaches should look like in the game. There will always be room for left-field decisions when it comes to hiring coaches, but that can\u2019t be the only way.", "description": "Years ago, when he was dropping pearlers like the only fetchers he knew were his beer-retrieving sons, former Springbok coach Jake White once quizzed the rugby hacks about where they take their kids when they are sick \u2013 to their local GP or a student", "authors": ["Simnikiwe Xabanisa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9398/119ec194719d4584930ff3353fba75ae.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
