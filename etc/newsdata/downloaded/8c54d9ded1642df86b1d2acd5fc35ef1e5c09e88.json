But it\u2019s now growing physically, too, sprawling eastwards towards the coast with new districts of modernist architecture. And the recent opening of contemporary art museum, Montpellier Contemporary (MOCO), adds an extra cultural dimension.\n\nWhat to do\n\nBut is it art?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe headline event this summer is the opening of MOCO, the new hub of the city\u2019s burgeoning contemporary art scene. Expect some serious chin-stroking over the challenging pieces from the inaugural exhibition, based around the Ishikawa Collection, which runs until the end of September. The artworks are set in the Hotel Montcalm, a grand 17th-century townhouse with manicured gardens, plus there\u2019s an art-themed bookshop and restaurant featuring striking art installations. Open Tuesday to Sunday noon-7pm (10pm in summer); entry \u20ac8.\n\nOld town charm\n\nThe 19th-century Place de la Comedie, styled on Haussmann-era Paris, is the beating heart of the city with its illuminated fountain, The Three Graces, at its centre. But it\u2019s the place to meet, not hang out. Join a two-hour walking tour from the tourist office on the western flank of the square to uncover the city\u2019s medieval origins amid the labyrinthine backstreets of the Old Town. This area can be hard to navigate but the Essential Montpellier walk combines the story of Montpellier as an historic centre for medicine with visiting hidden-gem attractions only accessible on tours, such as some of the 18th-century Hotel Particuliers, private mansions set around courtyards, and the Mikve Jewish baths, a site for spiritual ritual. Back at Comedie, finish at the stately Musee Fabre, the classical art museum. Tours \u20ac10, or included with the City Card.\n\nNew beginnings\n\nFor a totally different perspective on city life, take a tram to the eastern Rives du Lez district to stroll around the modernist buildings shifting the city eastwards to the beach. You can take a guided tour (\u20ac10) of the still somewhat work-in-progress area, or simply wander around, watching out for such landmark buildings as The Cloud, designed by Philippe Starck, and the RBC Design Centre (see where to shop). Finish at the Marche du Lez for lunch (see where to eat).\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHotel rooms are at a premium during the busy summer period, so it may be worth checking out Airbnb options, too.\n\nTo be at the heart of the action, it\u2019s hard to beat the Grand Hotel du Midi, located just off the Place de la Comedie. The historic building has a red-hued interior and arty vibe with views across the main square. Doubles from \u20ac125, breakfast \u20ac17.\n\nA 10-minute walk to the centre, and a place with a more homely, low-key feel, is the Hotel des Arceaux. Two historic townhouses have been joined to form this 18-room boutique hotel set in quiet, pretty gardens. Doubles from \u20ac75, breakfast \u20ac11.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to spend more time exploring the Rives du Lez district than the city centre, the Marriott Courtyard is a modern hotel with an outdoor pool located next to the modernist Town Hall designed by architect Jean Nouvel. There\u2019s a direct tram link to Place de la Comedie that takes 15 minutes. Rooms from \u20ac250, B&B.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nThe city covers all bases from fast snacks to fine dining but beware: many places close Sundays and Mondays.\n\nIgnore the decent if less authentic places around Place Jean-Jaures and head deeper into the backstreets, seeking out Place Saint-Ravy and Place Saint-Roch for places the locals frequent. Try Rosemarie for fresh, bistro-style food, served on a breeze-cooled terrace, for lunch and dinner (mains around \u20ac15).\n\nLes Halles Laissac is the city\u2019s new covered market and food hall for lunch on the go and plenty of local produce. For a weekend brunch, try the cafe at MOCO Panacee, a gallery space dedicated to emerging artists that forms part of the MOCO project. It hosts a popular Sunday brunch until 3pm (\u20ac18), evening tapas and a set lunch (\u20ac14).\n\nHeading outside the centre to the up-and-coming Rives du Lez district, the Marche du Lez has a lively food market and food trucks offset by street art. The pick of the restaurants inside the main courtyard is La Baraquette with a good-value two/three-course set lunch for \u20ac18/21.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nA pavement cafe and a glass of local Languedoc wine is the quintessential Montpellier aperitif. The main squares attract the tour groups but there are plenty of more authentic places in the backstreets.\n\nLinger over an all-day glass at L\u2019Atelier de la Canourgue on Place de la Canourgue, Montpellier\u2019s most attractive historic square. This is also home to the Jardin des Sens, the restaurant and hotel (re-opening at the end of 2019) in the 17th-century Hotel Richer de Belleval.\n\nCraft ales have also reached the Med with the new brewpub Hopulus located just off Place Jean-Jaures. It has a \u20ac5 happy hour from 4-7pm, beers brewed on site and some small tapas plates, all located in a rustic, air-conditioned bar on Rue Collot. Open 4pm until late.\n\nFor a taste of Hemingway-era charm, Le Papa Doble on Rue du Petit Scel is a cool cocktail bar with a Cuban twist for a mojito in the sun and a classic cocktail menu. Open 6pm until late.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nExploring the labyrinthine backstreets of the Old Town reveals lots of interesting places to hunt for souvenirs, especially around Instagrammers\u2019 favourite, Rue du Bras-de-Fer. Look out for retro-style postcards, prints and poster on Rue de l\u2019Ancien Courrier, the oldest pedestrian street in the city.\n\nThe local speciality is a rather uninspiring sweet, the Grisettes de Montpellier, which are flavoured with liquorice. A better bet is a bottle of Languedoc wine, especially if it\u2019s from the Pic Saint-Loup vineyards located just outside Montpellier in the Herault region. Stock up on a few bottles and try other local flavours at deli-epicerie Le Panier d\u2019Aime, located on Rue du Plan du Palais. Open Monday-Saturday, 9.30am-7pm.\n\nFinally, if you\u2019re inspired by the city\u2019s experiment with modernism, the Rives des Lez district is home to the RBC Design Centre for designer homewares and a books section devoted to weighty tomes on architecture and urbanism. Open Monday-Saturday, 9.30am-7pm.\n\nArchitectural highlight\n\nThe city\u2019s latest symbol of architectural modernism is the Arbre Blanc, a striking Japanese-style pagoda on the banks of the Lez River. There\u2019s a trendy ground-floor restaurant and a chic rooftop bar \u2013 if you can get in.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nWhat currency do I need?\n\nEuros.\n\nWhat language do they speak?\n\nFrench.\n\nShould I tip?\n\nTipping in restaurants is voluntary, usually about 10 per cent.\n\nWhat\u2019s the time difference?\n\nMontpellier is one hour ahead of the UK and flight times average two hours. EasyJet and British Airways fly direct from London; Air France-KLM flies from Manchester.\n\nPublic transport\n\nYou can explore the historic centre on foot but you\u2019ll need to make friends with the Tam network to explore other districts. A day public transport pass costs \u20ac4.30.\n\nBest view\n\nClimb the 90 spiral steps to the top of the city\u2019s Arc de Triomphe, part of the Place Royale du Peyrou, for cityscape views across the rooftops to the Mediterranean coast beyond.\n\nInsider tip\n\nPick up a 48-hour City Card at the tourist office for \u20ac22. It includes one guided tour, discounts for attractions and free public transport, including a link to the beach at Carnon in 30 minutes. Many places are closed on Mondays.\n\nTourist information: montpellier-france.com; france.fr", "description": "Given the young vibe, Mediterranean disposition and long hours of sunshine, it\u2019s no wonder that Montpellier is growing in status.
