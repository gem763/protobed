On the other hand, the Bears win was made all the sweeter by QB Mitchell Trubisky coming alive after a slow season start and wide receiver Taylor Gabriel sealing the deal repeatedly.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nThe Bears defense was DOMINANT on MNF! \ud83d\ude31\n\n\ud83d\udc3b3 Forced Fumbles\n\n\ud83d\udc3b1 Pick-Six, 3 INTs Total\n\n\ud83d\udc3b4 Sacks#Bears100 | @ChicagoBears pic.twitter.com/7XnQHIbaJm \u2014 NFL (@NFL) September 24, 2019\n\nHowever, for ESPN and the NFL, that sealed deal was not such a celebration.\n\nSnaring 10.4 million viewers u against a soft Premiere Monday on the Big 4, the ESPN flagship football show dropped 11% from the audience that MNF attracted last week when the Cleveland Browns flattened the New York Jets 23-3.\n\nStory continues\n\nUp against the comparable MNF of last season, last night\u2019s game was down 13% from the viewership that the Pittsburgh Steelers inched a 30-27 victory over Tampa Bay.\n\nWinning primetime on both broadcast and cable as usual, MNF scored a 3.7 rating among adults 18-49. To pour on the math, that\u2019s 10% decline in the key demo from last week and a 16% hit from the third week MNF of the 2018/2019 season.\n\nThe writing was a bit on the ball this morning when a 7.3-metered market result started making the rounds. In a pro-football season that so far has seemed ratings strong compared to previous years (to put it kindly), that early metric was down a hard 17% from the first numbers for the September 15 MNF match-up. Year-to-year, last night\u2019s game took another double-digit tumble with a 13% metered market ratings decline from that Steelers and Buccaneers battle.\n\nLet\u2019s see how those Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals do on MNF next week to figure out if this is a ratings trend or a pothole.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
