We believe in a dour brine, to allow the essential nature to shine. You can have too much going on.\n\nOne thing that should be made clear is that saltpetre in a brine is a mistake. It has an industrial feeling, you start itching as soon as the stuff comes into the kitchen, and since it works at speed it belies the very intention of a brine.\n\nBring all the brine ingredients to the boil in a large stainless steel pot, making sure that the sugar and salt are thoroughly dissolved. Pour this into a container which will happily fit into your fridge, and allow to cool. When the liquid is cool, place the guinea fowl in it and leave overnight. Rinse before continuing with the recipe.\n\nIt is noted in Nose to Tail that this recipe for aioli is not for purists, for whom our methods might seem crude. For them there are other aioli recipes, and we will not be hurt if they use those instead. But this is how we make our aioli: with eggs, and in a food processor rather than a pestle and mortar. It stands us in good stead.\n\nStill more brazen: aioli\u2019s role in life is to be unapologetically strong. Invariably when our new chefs make this aioli for the first time there is a timid query: \u201cSorry to ask, Chef, are you sure the recipe is right?\u201d It is indeed right. It may be a little terrifying in isolation, but it will make perfect sense alongside its companion.\n\nTo make approximately 1 litre of aioli \u2013 an excellent thing to have in the fridge \u2013 put the garlic into a blender with a pinch of salt to get things going and blitz until fine. Add the yolks and blend again to incorporate with the garlic and, while the blender whizzes, slowly trickle in the olive oil until it is emulsified. At this point add half the lemon juice and a pinch of black pepper. Taste, and adjust with salt, more lemon juice and pepper, and a little water to let it back, if needed.\n\nTo cook the guinea fowl, place the bird and all the stock ingredients in a pot, cover with the chicken stock and bring gently to the boil. As soon as it boils, cover it with a lid, remove from the heat and allow to cool.\n\nStrain the stock and return it to a clean pot, keeping back enough of the fortified broth to cook your summer vegetables. Immerse the guinea fowl and heat through gently but thoroughly, which should take around 30 minutes on a gentle heat. You may worry that this gentle method will not be sufficient to cook the bird through, but be brave. You will have a bird which is moist, without falling apart or toughening up.\n\nBring the stock for the vegetables to the boil and drop in the grelots (a whole shallot will suffice, if grelots are not forthcoming). Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, then reduce to a simmer and add the carrots and turnips, cooking them until just tender. Now in with the radishes, broad beans and peas for the merest of moments, then stir in your turnip greens. Remove from the heat immediately, pull the bird from the broth and joint it roughly. Season the broth, being mindful that the bird was already brined, then spoon the broth and vegetables into bowls and top each with a piece of jointed guinea fowl and a dollop of aioli.\n\nIf you have any broth left over, then you have the most beautiful stock to use as you please.\n\nHam, marrow and parsley sauce\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Jason Lowe\n\nThere is no more comforting way of eating a hot ham, and no better way of eating a sadly overlooked vegetable. Marrows are serene. There they sit in the vegetable patch, not bothering anyone. A friendly nature, the marrow.\n\nServes 8\n\ncooked ham 1, with its stock (see below)\n\nEnglish marrows 2, peeled, halved lengthways and with seeds removed (a teaspoon is the perfect marrow gutter)\n\nFor the parsley sauce\n\nwhole milk 800ml\n\nbay leaves 3\n\nonions 2, peeled and quartered, each quarter studded with a clove\n\nunsalted butter 80g\n\nplain white flour 80g\n\nham stock\n\nsea salt and black pepper\n\ndijon mustard 1 tbsp\n\ncurly parsley 1 large bunch, picked and finely chopped\n\nFor the cooked ham (to serve 8 \u2013 bear in mind that it is always good to cook enough to keep in the fridge for later)\n\nham leg 1, boned and rolled, or a 4kg piece of rolled collar\n\ncelery 4 sticks\n\nonions 4, peeled and halved\n\nleeks 4, cleaned\n\ncarrots 4, peeled\n\ngarlic 1 whole head, split in half widthways\n\na bundle of joy parsley stalks, thyme, rosemary and bay leaves tied together tightly\n\nblack peppercorns 10\n\nchicken stock 3\u20134 litres\n\nTo cook the ham, place everything together in a large pan and, if the ham is not submerged by the stock, add water to cover. Bear in mind that, at a pinch, water alone would work, so do not be nervous if it does need a top-up. Bring gently to the boil, skim, then reduce to a simmer for 2\u00bd to 3 hours.\n\nCheck with a knife or skewer; you are looking for a degree of give but you do not want your ham falling apart. Having said this, if you find that this is the case do not worry \u2013 there are many good uses for slightly-falling-apart ham. Strain and discard the vegetables, which will have given up their goodness, and reserve the stock.\n\nTo make the parsley sauce, bring the milk, bay leaves and clove-studded onions to a gentle simmer in a heavy-bottomed pan, then remove from the heat and allow everything to infuse for an hour or so.\n\nMelt the butter, add the flour and stir over a gentle heat; you do not want it to colour but you are looking for the biscuity aroma which indicates that it is ready for the milk, which you should whisk into the mixture with confidence until it is firm and creamy. Then begin to add ladles of ham stock until a silky, velvety consistency has been reached \u2013 it should pool, but not run away. Test for seasoning and whisk in the dijon mustard, then stir the chopped parsley through the comforting sauce just before serving.\n\nChop your marrow halves widthways into 5\u20137\u00bdcm chunks. Simmer them in the rest of the ham stock, bearing in mind marrow has a tendency to take on moisture and implode. When it is just shy of tender, lift from the stock and serve next to the ham: the residual heat will take the marrows to where they need to be, while still retaining their dignity.\n\nBe generous with your parsley sauce, serve it in jugs and allow your companions to express themselves with the pouring.\n\nCarrots, broad beans or peas, dropped into the cooking liquor at the appropriate time, are admirable substitutions for the gentle marrow.\n\nSmoked cod\u2019s roe, egg and potato cake\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Jason Lowe\n\nTo serve 6\n\neggs 6 large\n\nduck fat potato cake 18 fingers, well-seasoned, still hot (see below)\n\nmustard cress a good handful\n\nFor the duck fat potatoes\n\nmaris piper potatoes 6 large, peeled and sliced wafer thin (use a mandoline)\n\nsea salt\n\nduck fat 200g\n\nvegetable oil or more duck fat for deep frying\n\nFor the roe\n\nmilk 600ml\n\nlemon juice of 1\n\ngarlic 2 cloves, grated\n\nwhite bread 200g, without crusts,\n\ncut into cubes\n\nsmoked cod\u2019s roe 700g\n\nextra virgin olive oil 600ml\n\nvegetable oil 500ml\n\nTo make the duck fat potato cake, rinse the sliced potatoes in a colander to wash off any excess starch, allow them to drip dry for 30 minutes, shaking every so often to help them along, then place them in a large mixing bowl and season with salt. Gently melt the duck fat until warm and liquid and pour over the potatoes, gently mixing with your hands to ensure that they are coated evenly but being careful not to damage the slices.\n\nIn a roasting tray at least 2\u00bdcm deep and lined with greaseproof paper, start layering the potatoes evenly and methodically, building up layer by layer. Depth is important in this step. Cover your finished strata with tin foil and bake in a medium oven (180C/gas mark 4) for 2 hours, or until a knife easily goes through the cooked potato. Remove the foil and bake for a further 10 minutes, then take out of the oven and allow to cool. Find a tray of a similar surface area which will fit on top of the potato dish. Add some weight from tins or bottles and allow to press in the fridge overnight. The next day, turn it out and cut into fingers roughly 2\u00bdcm high, 6\u00bdcm wide and 5mm deep. Deep fry until golden brown.\n\nPrepare the roe. Combine the milk, lemon juice and garlic in a large bowl, then add the bread and leave to soak until it has taken up all the liquid. When ready, pour it into the bowl of a blender along with the smoked cod\u2019s roe and blend until smooth. Slowly add the oil little by little as you blend to emulsify.\n\nBoil the eggs according to your preferred soft-boiling method: we favour plunging them into boiling water and cooking for 6 minutes, then removing from the heat and plunging immediately into iced water. Peel the eggs when they are cool, treating them tenderly so as not to break the soft yolks.\n\nDollop the cod\u2019s roe on to the platter, scatter the potato cake fingers around, and place the boiled eggs carefully among them, cutting them in half to allow the yolk to run. Nestle clusters of mustard cress next to the eggs.\n\nTomato, little gem and anchovy \u2013 \u2018the salad which saved my life\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The salad which saved my life\u2019. Photograph: Jason Lowe\n\nHere the juices of the soft, sweet tomatoes mix with the vinaigrette to create a wonderful, rich tomato dressing.\n\nSome 20 years ago I went to visit my sister in Barcelona and we had to have five lunches in one day. At that time much of the city shut over the weekend so we had to take in every restaurant she wanted to show me on the Friday of my arrival. The pace continued, fuelled by the icy cold, rough version of marc they serve in those parts. So on Saturday morning I truly thought I was dying. We went to a very ancient restaurant, whose name escapes me but which laid some claim to being the oldest or thereabouts, and I ordered this salad. I lived! Here I am to prove it! I am alive thanks to this salad.\n\nServes 4\n\ntomatoes 6\n\nextra virgin olive oil\n\nsea salt and black pepper\n\ncurly parsley a handful, finely chopped\n\ngood anchovy fillets in oil 16, separated but kept whole \u2013 we like Ortiz\n\nlittle gem lettuce 2 heads, washed and dismantled but with the leaves left whole\n\nvinaigrette a splash (see below)\n\nFor the vinaigrette (makes approximately 800ml)\n\ndijon mustard 125g\n\nwhite wine vinegar 125ml\n\nextra virgin olive oil 525ml\n\nlemon juice of \u00bd\n\ngarlic 1 large clove, finely minced\n\nsea salt and black pepper\n\nTo make the vinaigrette, mix the mustard and vinegar together and, once they are combined, begin to whisk as you slowly trickle in the extra virgin olive oil. The mixture should emulsify. Finally, add the lemon juice, minced garlic and seasoning.\n\nSlice the tomatoes in half, dress with the olive oil, and salt and pepper and roast them in a medium oven (180C/gas mark 4) for 20 minutes. They will soften slightly and dry a little, intensifying and sweetening their flavour. Allow them to cool, then mix all the ingredients in a bowl and eat immediately.\n\nThe Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Good Fish Guide\n\nSalted chocolate and caramel tart\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Jason Lowe\n\nThis is a very rich tart, you will not need very much.\n\nServes at least 16\n\nFor the tart case\n\nplain flour 200g\n\ncocoa powder 45g\n\nbicarbonate of soda 7g\n\ndemerara sugar 180g\n\ncaster sugar 25g\n\nMaldon sea salt 5g\n\nunsalted butter 225g, softened\n\ndark chocolate 225g, chopped finely \u2013 the pieces should be smaller than a chocolate chip\n\nFor the caramel\n\ncaster sugar 225g\n\nunsalted butter 70g, cut into chunks\n\ndouble cream 80ml\n\nFor the chocolate filling\n\ndouble cream 500g\n\nglucose 40g\n\ndark chocolate 400g, broken into pieces\n\nbutter 40g\n\nsea salt for sprinkling\n\nFirst make the tart case. It is easiest by far to use a machine for this. Mix together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarb of soda, both sugars and the salt, place in a food processor with the butter, and whizz until a loose dough forms. At this point add the chocolate and mix again. Wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for half an hour or so.\n\nIf you are making the pastry any further in advance, take it out of the fridge in good time \u2013 you need the softness of room-temperature dough for it to work. When ready, butter and flour a tart case and roll the pastry between two sheets of baking parchment \u2013 the shards of chocolate would tear clingfilm, but the dough is too sticky to be rolled loose. Line the case with the pastry, rolled to around 4mm thick, line the pastry with foil or ovenproof clingfilm, fill with baking beans and bake in a medium oven (180C/gas mark 4) for 25 to 30 minutes.\n\nWhen you remove the case from the oven, wait 10 minutes before removing the beans, otherwise the hot, soft pastry may tear. Once you have done so, press the base and sides all over with the back of a spoon while it is still warm \u2013 the aim here is to smooth it ready for the caramel, pushing down the inside corners which may have risen and rounded a little in the baking.\n\nOnce the case is cool, make your caramel. It is essential to move quickly when the caramel is ready, so ensure that all your ducks are in a row before you start. Place the sugar in a scrupulously dry pan and melt over a medium high heat. Do not stir! Stirring will result in a crystallised disaster. Swirling the pan a little is allowed. By the time the sugar has dissolved you should have a good colour, trusting that it can be quite dark and still be comfortable. Throw the butter in first and follow with the cream, whisk them together quickly and, at the very moment that they are smoothly incorporated, pour it into the case immediately. With speed, pick up your tart case and move it around, tilting it to ensure that the caramel covers the entire base. Leave aside to cool.\n\nFinally, for the chocolate filling, heat the cream with the glucose and take it just shy of a simmer. Place the chocolate and butter in a bowl and pour the hot cream over the chunks in three stages, stirring gently to incorporate \u2013 the first will melt the chocolate, the second will loosen the mixture and the third will make the smooth ganache. Then pour the mixture into the tart and leave to cool and solidify. Sprinkle with a little sea salt and serve with creme fraiche.\n\nFig and almond tart\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Jason Lowe\n\nThe sweet pastry case can be used for bakewell tarts, custard tarts and any number of tart possibilities. This recipe is enough to line 2 x 25cm tart cases \u2013 it is handy to have a lined case or two in the freezer for inevitable moments of immediate tart need.\n\nServes 12\n\nfigs a couple of handfuls, cut in half\n\nflaked almonds a handful\n\nFor the pastry (enough for 2 tarts)\n\nplain flour 500g\n\ncaster sugar 180g\n\nground almonds 60g\n\nlemon zest of \u00bd\n\ncold butter 300g\n\negg yolks 6\n\nFor the frangipane (enough for 2 tarts)\n\nunsalted butter 225g, softened\n\ncaster sugar 225g\n\neggs 4\n\nplain flour 2 level tbsp\n\nground almonds 150g\n\namaretto 1 tbsp\n\nnibbed almonds 75g\n\nFirst make the tart cases. Mix the dry ingredients and lemon zest together in a bowl, then add the butter, cut into small chunks, and rub between your fingers to form breadcrumbs. This can be done very satisfactorily and with less bother in a mixer with the paddle attachment. Pour in the egg yolks and mix again until a dough forms, then wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for half an hour.\n\nLightly butter and flour your tart cases. Roll out each pastry ball on a floured surface to 4mm thick and line the tart cases, pushing the pastry down carefully to fill each crevice, then place in the freezer for 3 hours to bake from frozen. Line the cases with foil or oven-safe clingfilm, fill with baking beans and bake for 25 minutes in a medium oven. When the edges are pale golden, remove the baking beans \u2013 you may find that the bottom still looks a little raw; if so, pop it back into the oven for 5 minutes without the baking beans, just to wipe the sweat from its brow.\n\nNow for the frangipane, as the tart cases cool. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale, light and fluffy, then take 2 of the eggs and add them one at a time, beating well after adding each one. At this point add the flour, beating again, and then the remaining 2 eggs. When the mixture is loose and smooth, add the amaretto and the almonds.\n\nSet aside half the frangipane if you are not using it \u2013 it also freezes excellently. Pipe or spoon the remaining half into the cool pastry, smooth, then lay on the figs, cut side up, in your desired configuration. There is no need to press them in as the frangipane will rise around them. Bake the tart for 30 minutes then carefully remove from the oven, scatter the flaked almonds on the wobbling surface, and bake for a further 15 minutes until a skewer comes out clean. Serve hot or cold, with creme fraiche or cream.\n\nThis is a tart for any season, being an equally accommodating host for apricots, pears, plums, berries, or whatever fruit you have to hand.\n\nThe Book of St John by Fergus Henderson & Trevor Gulliver (Ebury Press, \u00a330).
