Bill Johnson on storming closed-door impeachment hearing: What do Dems have to hide?", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Bill Johnson, who was part of a group of fed-up Republican lawmakers who stormed a hearing related to the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, slammed the \u201csham of an impeachment proceeding\u201d for occurring \u201cbehind closed doors.\u201d\n\nJohnson, R.-Ohio, appeared on \"Your World with Neil Cavuto\" Thursday to lay out the scene of what led to yesterday\u2019s Republican storming of a closed-door hearing.\n\n\u201cWhat do they have to hide?\u201d Johnson asked of Democrats. \u201cIt is time for them to stop this secretive process and give every member of the House what we are entitled to on behalf of the 721,000 people we represent access to that information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy the Democrats have decided to do it this way nobody knows,\u201d Johnson told Fox Business' Charles Payne -- who was filling in for Neil Cavuto -- reiterating Republican lawmakers\u2019 frustration at being left out of impeachment inquiry testimonies.\n\nREP. BYRNE ON DISRUPTING CLOSED-DOOR IMPEACHMENT INTERVIEW: PROBE IS A 'HATCHET JOB' BY DEMS\n\n\u201cUnder President Nixon, a Democrat speaker gave president Nixon fairness, due process, and justice. Under President Clinton, a Republican speaker gave the same to President Clinton,\u201d Johnson told Payne.\n\nRepublican lawmakers on Wednesday held a press conference to \"bring light\" to the lack of transparency with which House Democrats have allegedly been conducting the impeachment inquiry. After the press conference, they marched into a a secure room in Congress where an impeachment hearing was being held, causing a scene in which House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., abruptly halted proceedings.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: 2020 DEMOCRATS LOOK 'NERVOUS' WHEN BIDEN SPEAKS AT DEBATES\n\nJohnson added that he fully supports Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s, R-S.C., resolution formally condemning House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry on the grounds that proceedings defy historical precedent and deny fundamental \u201cdue process\u201d to the White House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with the Washington Post very often but I do agree with their masthead on the front of their newspaper: democracy dies in darkness,\u201d said Johnson. \u201c The Constitution gives the House full authority over impeachment, not the speaker, and certainly not Adam Schiff.\u201d\n\nJohnson again noted that the inquiry into Trump was unlike any impeachment inquiry before it. \u201cBack to those previous impeachment inquiries under Nixon and Clinton, both the presidents had counsel who were allowed to cross-examine witnesses. They could examine evidence and interview witnesses; they had subpoena power, -- they gave subpoena power to the minority party,\u201d said Johnson.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question this is all political,\u201d Johnson added. He said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had brought an impeachment vote to the House floor several times before and it had failed.\n\nJohnson said he suspects Pelosi does not have the votes to pursue impeachment, noting that a lot of members in her party were elected in districts that voted for President Trump in 2016. According to Rasmussen, 21 House Democrats hail from districts that voted for Trump in 2016. Should those Democrats vote against articles of impeachment, Pelosi would not have the simple majority necessary to pass impeachment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to find out Charles, the president did nothing wrong,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI read the transcript, if they don\u2019t have anything to hide why dont they come out and show that.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
