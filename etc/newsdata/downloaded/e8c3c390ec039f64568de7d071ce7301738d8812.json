Disney\n\nThe new additions extend beyond park walls: every dining location inside Disney's 36 Orlando and three Anaheim hotels will also get vegan options. They include \"Carrot Gnocchi\" at The Turf Club Bar and Grill at the Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa and \"Cauliflower Tacos\" at The Wave of American Flavors at Disney's Contemporary Resort.\n\nFrom the \"Chili-Spiced Crispy Fried Tofu\" at Animal Kingdom to \"Eggless Florentine\" on Main Street U.S.A., Disney is being careful to call the items \"plant-based\" and not \"vegan.\" That's because the exact definition of what qualifies as vegan has long been a moving target.\n\nTo help guests easily spot the plant-based plates, Disney is marking each menu item with a new green leaf logo.\n\nLike many of Disney's food offerings, some of the vegan dishes are themed to match their location. This hummus dish served at Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge is called a \"Felucian Garden Spread,\" a reference to a planet covered in overgrown plants in the Star Wars universe. Disney\n\nHowever, the company did say that all of the items \"are made without animal meat, dairy, eggs or honey,\" meeting the broadest definition of vegan cuisine.\n\nThere are few places less hospitable for vegans and vegetarians than theme parks, where the standard fare is burgers and dogs. They are among the biggest sellers at Disney World, which serves 10 million burgers, 6 million hot dogs and 1.8 million pounds worth of its iconic turkey legs every year.\n\nThe scarcity of plant-based meal options, plus the difficulty in identifying them, has led Disney's vegan fans to create their own online survival guides.\n\nParis and Hong Kong have plant-based options, too\n\nThere are plant-based food options at the international parks, including \"Risotto-style Spelt with Mushrooms\" at Disneyland Paris, \"Pan-fried Vegetables with Plant-based Dumplings\" at Hong Kong Disneyland, or \"Caramel Mix Nuts Banana Cake\" at Shanghai Disney Resort.", "description": "More than 400 vegan dishes will be available in restaurants at Florida's Walt Disney World in early October and California's Disneyland in spring 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F180620114344-02-disney-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
