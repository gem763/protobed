Biden and concluded Mr. Trump did not violate campaign finance laws, officials announced Wednesday.\n\nAnd a separate division of the department has also ruled that the administration did not break the law by failing to quickly share a whistleblower\u2019s complaint with Congress, saying the matter didn\u2019t meet the definition of \u201curgent\u201d that would trigger the law.\n\nThe department also released the transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, showing the American leader did talk about Mr. Biden, the former vice president and current Democratic presidential front-runner, and his son, Hunter Biden. But Mr. Trump did not threaten to withhold military aid as some have alleged.\n\nMr. Trump did tell President Volodymyr Zelensky that his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr would reach out to him to discuss the Biden case.\n\n\u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General William Barr give you a call and we will get to the bottom of it,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to the transcript of the call reviewed by The Washington Times.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump said it would be \u201cgreat\u201d if Ukraine reopened its investigation.\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump says transcript refutes Democrats\u2019 claim of \u2018call from hell\u2019 with Ukraine\n\n\u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that [Joe] Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Mr. Trump said according to the transcript. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. See if you can look into it\u2026.it sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nMr. Zelensky appeared receptive to reviewing the Hunter Biden probe, saying a newly appointed prosecutor will \u201clook into the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue of the investigation of the case \u2026 so we will take care of that and work on the investigation of the case,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the attorney general was first made aware of the call several weeks after the July conversation between the two world leaders.\n\n\u201cThe president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything related to former Vice President Biden or his son,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe President has not asked the attorney general to contact the Ukraine \u2014 on this or any other matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe attorney general has not communicated with Ukraine \u2014 on this or any other subject. Nor has the attorney general discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine with Rudy Giuliani,\u201d she continued.\n\nAlso, during the conversation, Mr. Trump appears to imply a missing server from the Democrat National Committee is located in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say crowd strike\u2026The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nThat conversation has turned into a firestorm in Washington, where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says it amounts to a breach of the president\u2019s oath of office and is troubling enough to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Trump has insisted the conversation was innocent.\n\nA whistleblower reported the conversation to authorities Aug. 12, citing information from \u201cWhite House officials\u201d and saying it appeared Mr. Trump was trying to pressure Ukraine to assist in his 2020 election.\n\nThe intelligence community inspector general concluded that the whistleblower showed political bias \u2014 but said the report was still credible and urgent enough that it needed to be shared with Congress by the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel said that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether such a complaint falls within the statutory definition of \u2018urgent concern\u2019 that the law requires the DNI to forward to the intelligence committees. We conclude that it does not,\u201d wrote Steven A. Engel, assistant attorney general at the OLC.\n\nThey also ruled that the president\u2019s conversation was a diplomatic communication and not an intelligence activity, and the president isn\u2019t a part of the intelligence community anyway, so his behavior is not part of the DNI\u2019s purview.\n\n\u201cSuch matters simply do not relate to \u2018the funding, administration or operation of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority\u2019 of the DNI,\u201d Mr. Engel concluded.\n\nHe said if anything, the Justice Department should be the ones to investigate.\n\nAnd indeed that happened. The Justice Department\u2019s criminal division said it probed the conversation as a possible violation of campaign finance laws, wondering if Mr. Trump had solicited a contribution of sorts by asking Ukraine to probe an opponent.\n\nThe department said it concluded that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nThe review came in late August when intelligence officials referred the matter to the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division to see if the president\u2019s comments violated laws barring candidates requesting assistance from foreign sources.\n\nIntelligence officials also made a separate referral to the FBI, which was rerouted back to the Justice Department.\n\nAfter reviewing a transcript of the call, prosecutors concluded there was no appropriate reason for a criminal investigation. But senior officials acknowledged the department\u2019s review did include interviews with potential witnesses to the phone call or others who may have had relevant information.\n\nThose same officials also the review was closed because help from a foreign country could not be considered \u201ca thing of value\u201d under campaign finance law. Federal law defines a \u201cthing of value\u201d has any assistance provided to a campaign and it is not limited to monetary donations.\n\nMs. Kupec said the Justice Department relied on \u201cestablished procedures\u201d and determined \u201cthere was no campaign finance violation and no further action was warranted.\n\n\u201cAll relevant components of the department agreed with this legal conclusion and the department has concluded the matter,\u201d she said.\n\nJustice officials said Mr. Barr was aware of the inspector general\u2019s referral, but he did not make the final decision to reject initiating a criminal investigation of the president.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
