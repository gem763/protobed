One of the guards later joined Trump\u2019s White House staff and is currently working for the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by five activists against Trump and his guards who say there were attacked during a peaceful protest outside the Manhattan high-rise four years ago. They were demonstrating against then-candidate Trump\u2019s remarks about the Black Lives Matter movement and his comments that Mexican immigrants were \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists.\u201d\n\nThe jury in the case that begins Thursday needs the testimony to determine to what extent the guards directly reported to Trump, and if he authorized the actions against protesters. One of the three guards named in the suit, Keith Schiller, was head of security of the Trump Organization and later became director of Oval Office operations under Trump in 2017. After he left the White House that year, Schiller was hired by the Republican National Committee to advise on security for the 2020 convention, according to CNN.\n\nTrump\u2019s request to quash a subpoena to testify was rejected Friday by Bronx Supreme Court Judge Doris Gonzalez.\n\n\u201cNo government official, including the executive, is above the law,\u201d Gonzalez ruled. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s relationship with the other defendants is now central to plaintiffs\u2019 prosecution of their claims under the theory of respondeat superior. As such, his testimony is indispensable.\u201d\n\nTrump was ordered to provide the testimony by Thursday, but he can appeal or request a delay.\n\nDuring the 2015 confrontation outside Trump Tower, guards told protesters (some of whom were dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes) that the sidewalk was private property \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 and pushed them away. Schiller was also captured on videotape (below) angrily ripping away protest signs and striking plaintiff Efrain Galicia in the head when he attempted to retrieve one of them. Schiller struck with \u201ca closed fist on the head with such force it caused (him) to stumble backwards,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nSchiller argued in an affidavit after the suit was filed that the protesters and their banners were blocking public access to the sidewalks and Trump Tower. He also claimed Galicia grabbed him from behind, and feared he was reaching for Schiller\u2019s firearm. \u201cI instinctively reacted by turning around ... and striking the person with my open hand,\u201d he said, noting Trump was inside the building at the time.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to forbid the Trump security officials from interfering with public protests and are seeking damages.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.", "description": "One of the guards captured on videotape in a violent scuffle became Trump's director of Oval Office operations.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d86bc7d210000aa00e8a9f9.png?cache=6fmiv6wths&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
