This isn\u2019t meant as a policy story, just a first-person observation of the daily struggles of some of the people waiting for their chance to claim asylum in the United States or, in some cases, to simply sneak across the border illegally.\n\nAt least one of the people profiled in the piece probably has a legitimate asylum claim. A Ugandan bodybuilder named Alphat fled his home country after he allegedly became the target of goons working on behalf of the country\u2019s president, Yoweri Museveni. The piece offers this summary of his story:\n\nEventually, he says, he was arrested, beaten and tortured because of his opposition ties. Policemen used string to hang heavy blocks from his penis. While he was in detention, his wife and two young daughters were shot and killed by military policemen, who had warned him to drop his political client.\n\nIf true, that\u2019s political persecution and torture which is the kind of thing our asylum laws were intended to help with. But Alphat isn\u2019t the only person featured in the story. I was struck by the story of another family, a father and three children, who came to the border apparently hoping to claim asylum and then decided to take matters into their own hands:\n\nHe\u2019s a distinguished-looking man with close-cropped hair and a beard going gray. He speaks three languages fluently and a smattering of others. He studied to work on large-scale electrical projects, but in the chaos of Congo, where the economy barely functions in many regions, he survived as an electrician. Shelter life weighs heavily on him. He worries what it\u2019s doing to his children. He\u2019s known among the migrants for agonizing about what he should do. In the spring, he and his three children flew from Angola to Colombia, where they met up with a couple hundred other Congolese migrants. The caravan spent 70 days in the jungles of Panama before making their way to Mexico. Then they separated, each rolling the dice on the limited information they had. He went to Juarez; his friends went elsewhere. At least a handful got through U.S. immigration. Some are now living in Maine. \u201cI could make a life there. This is not a life,\u201d he says, the words spilling out rapidly and bitterly. \u201cMy head isn\u2019t in a good place here. The stress is not bearable.\u201d He spends his days sifting among the rumors that filter through migrant discussions on Facebook and WhatsApp: Try a border crossing into New Mexico, someone says. Try near San Antonio says another. Just go illegally, some say, arguing there are plenty of places to cross.\n\nThe story reveals that the man\u2019s wife was killed in \u201cpolitical violence\u201d so maybe he was hoping to claim asylum on that basis, but the story also suggests he came to the US border hoping for a better job and a better life. That\u2019s certainly understandable but it\u2019s not grounds for an asylum claim. Ultimately, he decides to cross the border illegally, perhaps to join his friends who have already done so:\n\nA few weeks later, he is gone. Just before he disappeared with his family, the Congolese man told Fierro they had to leave. They\u2019d cross illegally. \u201cPastor, I\u2019m out of hope,\u201d he told the pastor. \u201cI can\u2019t wait anymore.\u201d\n\nAgain, the facts of this story aren\u2019t completely clear but I suspect this father who gets his border crossing rumors from WhatsApp had heard that people coming to the border with children could make an asylum claim and quickly get released into the country. Now that Trump\u2019s remain in Mexico policy is in effect, that back door entrance to America is closing. Some people will look at the situation and decide to go home. Others will wait for as many months as necessary to make an asylum claim. But some will simply decide to become illegal immigrants and hope they get away with it. That\u2019s clearly the decision this father made.", "description": "\"I can\u2019t wait anymore.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Hot Air Staff", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/asylum.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
