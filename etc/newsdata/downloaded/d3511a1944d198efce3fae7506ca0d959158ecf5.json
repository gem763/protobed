He called the devastation \u201cunprecedented and extensive\u201d.\n\nAs the first person to have died in the storm was reported to be a seven-year-old boy, Lachino Mcintosh, who drowned after his family tried to move from their home, witnesses described large-scale flooding and damage as 185mph (300km/h) winds ripped roofs from buildings.\n\nThe Abaco Islands were largely blacked out for most of the night and morning as Dorian made landfall, but residents who managed to contact the local media or family or to post on social media described scenes of devastation after the hurricane made landfall on Elbow Cay just before 1am.\n\nThe Bahamas police chief, Samuel Butler, urged people to remain calm and share their GPS coordinates, but he said rescue crews had to wait until weather conditions improved.\n\n\u201cWe simply cannot get to you,\u201d he told Bahamas radio station ZNS.\n\nBahamas Press reported: \u201cOur team from Abaco confirms: the place is a disaster, no business is operable and bodies are floating around Big Cat. The concern is nobody knows how many people died, and they feel when the water subsides some bodies will be washed out to sea.\u201d\n\nSilbert Mills, the owner of the Bahamas Christian Network, said trees and power lines had been torn down across Abaco, home to 17,000 people, which appeared to be the place worst hit by the category 5 storm.\n\n\u201cThe winds are howling like we have never, ever experienced before,\u201d said Mills, who was riding out the hurricane with his family in the concrete home he built 41 years ago on central Abaco.\n\nEdward Cunningham, 19, of New Providence told the Guardian that while his house had escaped the winds their island was experiencing flooding.\n\n\u201cRight now, several areas on the island are flooded. Cars are under water, flooded and floating.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been directed by the government to stay indoors and away from the coast,\u201d he added.\n\nJack Pittard, a 76-year-old American who has been visiting the Bahamas for 40 years, also decided to stay put on Abaco for Dorian, which he said was his first hurricane. A short video from Pittard at about 2.30pm on Sunday showed the wind shaking his home and ripping off the siding.\n\nAnother resident pleaded for help as her home flooded.\n\n\u201cAnybody who can help me, this is Kendra Williams. I live in Heritage. We are under water; we are up in the ceiling.\n\n\u201cMe and my six grandchildren and my son, we are in the ceiling,\u201d she said in a text message to a friend.\n\nThe scale of the flooding was also revealed in social media posts that reported that the main airport on Grand Bahama was under 1.5 metres (5ft) of water.\n\nTweeting from Grand Bahama in the early hours of the morning, John Forbes wrote: \u201cTragic flooding, we are stranded!\u201d\n\n\u201cFlooding in Grand Bahama, everything is flooding! \u2026 My phone is currently on 41% and I am stranded in 10 feet water,\u201d Forbes added in later tweets.\n\nAs concern mounted across the Caribbean nation, relatives posted pictures of missing family members in communities in Abaco reported to be underwater.\n\nOne of the most dramatic accounts was carried by the Nassau Guardian, which spoke to Gertha Joseph, 35, a resident of the Marsh Harbour community on Abaco, during the worst of the storm before telephone communication was cut off.\n\nJoseph described the conditions in Marsh Harbour, the second location hit by Dorian, as a nightmare. \u201cEveryone is in the living room right now and the roof is about to lift,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out where to go next.\u201d\n\nJoseph said more than 50 people, including young children, were crowded into the small house praying and hoping for the best. \u201cI can\u2019t describe nothing right now because of what I\u2019m going through right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to keep praying. Everyone, please pray for us. [It\u2019s] me and my baby. Everyone got safe in our apartment building, but we\u2019re stuck right here.\n\n\u201cMy baby\u2019s only four months old. Please pray for us. I\u2019m begging y\u2019all. Pray for us. My apartment building, as we stayed in, the whole roof came off. We are staying right here. People are trying to make it to the other side where this house is. But some people, the water just took them and those are the only people that [made] it over there. Some people didn\u2019t get to make it.\u201d\n\nJoseph was later rescued. \u201cSome guy helped me out. He put [her son in] this plastic thing and he swam across with him because I can\u2019t swim. Then the guy came back to help me across the water.\u201d\n\nVernal Cooper, another resident of Marsh Harbour, told CNN: \u201cThere\u2019s damages everywhere around my area. Cars and houses destroyed. This is what\u2019s left of Marsh Harbour.\u201d", "description": "Bahamians say storm has left devastation, with buildings destroyed and bodies floating", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4043fab0e8ef685b44ad3c946720514187f09122/0_81_1715_1029/master/1715.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c2c1c734c71dea2f0f140f50c4f6bb86"}
