We estimate the impact of our pre-emptive strategies and of sustained compliance following our engagements in prior periods, known as wider revenue effects.\"\n\nThe report showed the complexity of integrated compliance, designed to identify taxpayers considered \"endemic non-compliers\" with tax laws. They include organisations not engaging in criminal behaviour but failing to comply with the rules.\n\nOne such organisation comprised more than 40 entities with assets totalling approximately $70 million.\n\nWider compliance activities by the ATO also captured billions.\n\nThe tax avoidance taskforce raised $1.9 billion in liabilities and $1.1 billion in cash collections; while the serious financial crime taskforce raised $235 million in liabilities and $71 million in cash.\n\nThe cross-government black economy program raised another $1.1 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstitute of Public Accountants senior tax adviser Tony Greco said the increased revenue was the result of better data use, and some 70,000 tip-offs from members of the public.\n\n\"They've received a lot more funding, courtesy of things like the black economy taskforce,\" he said.\n\n\"The ATO has got more resources and obviously there's a payback for that. The government expects a return and with extra funding they can produce better returns for their money.\n\n\"The larger taxpayers always attract a lot of focus but they're reasonable compliant. When the ATO starts looking elsewhere, and the focus starts moving to other taxpayers, the ground is more fertile.\"\n\nMr Greco said better use of data analytics and data matching increased the risk for taxpayers doing the wrong thing.\n\n\"They've always had benchmarks on the cash part of the economy and anyone who operates outside the benchmarks attracts a red flag for a visit.\n\n\"With people moving to more digital transactions it is becoming more difficult to hide and there's a lot more tips-offs from the public.\n\n\"People are acting with their feet, and record numbers are picking up the phone on who might be doing what,\" he said.", "description": "New Tax Office figures show just how lucrative dreaded tax audits can be for public revenue, with $1 billion in voluntary reports made last financial year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a4cdc480ea36825fea1428b8c49c1f5138722e9c", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
