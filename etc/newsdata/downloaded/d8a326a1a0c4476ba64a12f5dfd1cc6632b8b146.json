Now Smith, who has been with the network since it started in 1996, is gone, too.\n\nSmith left the network abruptly Friday, signing off after his daily newscast, \u201cShepard Smith Reporting.\u201d A frequent critic of President Donald Trump, and vice versa, Smith was never afraid to break from the company line, going back as far as arguing with other Fox News correspondents on-air about the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina, if not earlier.\n\nIn a statement Smith said, \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience, in context and with perspective, without fear or favor.\u201d\n\nIndeed, that last part is what has set Smith apart on the network. Increasingly, on shows like \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d the network has had almost a symbiotic relationship with Trump, who often quotes his favorite anchors, who sometimes quote him right back.\n\nLately, however, that relationship has soured. Trump has been more critical of Fox News in his tweets, and in the past he has singled out Smith.\n\nAdding fuel to the rumor fire, U.S. Attorney General William Barr met with Rupert Murdoch, the network\u2019s owner and chairman, earlier in the week at Murdoch\u2019s home. Smith\u2019s exit immediately fueled social-media scuttlebutt that the meeting had something to do with Friday\u2019s move, but so far there is no evidence that this is the case.\n\n\u201cShep\u2019s exit from the building was planned and executed by Shep with Fox\u2019s complete approval and the full support of Fox News,\u201d a representative said in a statement.\n\nThere is, however, reason for viewers to be concerned that one of the last honest brokers of information at Fox News is now silenced.\n\nThe network representative disagreed.\n\n\"Tell that to Jennifer Griffin, whose report just went viral this week,\" the representative said. \"Or Chris Wallace, Bret Baier, Bill Hemmer, Martha MacCallum or Catherine Herridge, who have all done outstanding journalism.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, but Smith's work has always stood out at the network, never more so than during Trump's political rise.\n\n\u201cSo recently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News,\u201d Smith said as his broadcast ended. \u201cAfter requesting that I stay, they obliged.\u201d\n\nEven Fox News employees were stunned.\n\nSmith \u201cjust dropped a bomb,\u201d John Roberts, Fox News\u2019 chief White House correspondent, tweeted. \u201cAfter 23 years at @FoxNews, he announced he is leaving the network. He was part of the glue that held Fox together. He is a supreme pro who made us all better.\u201d\n\n.@ShepNewsTeam Shepard Smith just dropped a bomb. After 23 years at @FoxNews , he announced he is leaving the network. He was part of the glue that held Fox together. He is a supreme pro who made us all better. \u2014 John Roberts (@johnrobertsFox) October 11, 2019\n\nMost recently Smith repeatedly went after Trump for insisting, wrongly, that Hurricane Dorian was going to hit Smith's home state of Alabama. After Trump produced a clearly doctored weather map, Smith said, \u201cWhy would the president of the United State do this? He decries fake news that isn\u2019t, and disseminates fake news that is.\u201d\n\nTrump, on the White House South Lawn, told reporters, \u201cDid I hear Shepard Smith is leaving? Is he leaving because of bad ratings? I wish Shepherd Smith well.\u201d\n\nSmith didn\u2019t just take on Trump. He also took on other Fox News personalities. Earlier this month he called Tucker Carlson \u201crepugnant.\u201d He also has defended CNN, a network Trump often cites as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nThis is a big loss for viewers \u2014 and citizens \u2014 who value facts above favor. Smith alluded to that with his parting words.\n\n\u201cEven in our currently polarized nation, it\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day,\u201d he said. \u201cThat the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will thrive,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWith his departure, that just got a little more difficult.\n\nBill Goodykoontz is a columnist for the Arizona Republic where this column first appeared.
