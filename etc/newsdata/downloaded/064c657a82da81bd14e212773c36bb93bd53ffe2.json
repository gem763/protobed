But the best part of the entire interview was Cleckner providing one specific example of a problem with these proposals: the smallest things can make someone a prohibited possessor.\n\n\"There are tons of proposals. None of them are going to work and do anything to stop violent crime, and some of the three worst, you mentioned, they are going to make manufacturers liable? That\u2019s scary. They are may be going to bring back the assault weapons ban, like you said, and register them under the National Firearms Act?\" Cleckner asked. \"And anyone who\u2019s guilty of a misdemeanor hate crime can lose their right to possess firearms forever. So manufacture liability \u2014 you know that\u2019s absurd. You aren\u2019t going to hold BIC lighters liable for arson. Doing that to the firearms industry would absolutely cripple the industry as we know it and I think that\u2019s the plan.\"\n\n\"Anyone who is committed a misdemeanor hate crime \u2014 I didn\u2019t even know that was a category, but okay \u2013 loses his right to the Second Amendment. He's no longer covered by the Second Amendment but he is still allowed to vote. You aren\u2019t allowed to go deer hunting but you can choose my president. How does that work exactly?\" Carlson asked, clearly confused.\n\n\"The people coming up with these rules want votes. There's one reason. Here's something scarier: I can talk about a potential slippery slope and say, 'Oh no, we can't do that about hate crimes because who gets to decide what\u2019s a hate crime?'\" Cleckner said.\n\n\"We have a perfect example right now. If Biden goes to New York City and calls him an illegal alien, he could lose his rights to guns forever under his own proposal because that's a hate crime now. It\u2019s a scary world,\" Cleckner explained.\n\nNew York City recently passed a law that would charge a person with a hate crime and fine them $250,000 for calling someone an \"illegal alien\"or threatening to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement on them, even if the person really is in the United States illegally. The City's Commission on Human Rights deemed the term \"alien\" as dehumanizing.\n\nBut Carlson brought up a good point: politicians are willing to unarm everyone, except those that are there to protect them.\n\n\"His federally-funded bodyguards would be armed with high-capacity magazines. He\u2019s upset, that\u2019s the point. The people who make these rules literally have no intention of abiding by them at all,\" Carlson replied. \"They would never give up their right to firearms because that would be scary.\"\n\n\"Exactly right. They could never answer the hypocrisy of what\u2019s going on. We\u2019ve talked about this before. When a politician tells you don\u2019t need a gun, maybe that\u2019s time you actually need the gun,\" Cleckner said.\n\nGun control advocates, like Beto O'Rourke and Joe Biden, aren't smart enough to think of the ramifications of their proposals. They don't think of every possible outcome that can come as a result of their proposed legislation. They simply throw it out there and hope it sticks. But when you start digging and thinking about these laws' implications, you start to realize their flaws.", "description": "Boom..10/03/2019 3:06:00AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/275/0a85e002-aec7-49c9-82d5-7a5a2adf48b1.png"}
