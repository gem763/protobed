Banning \u2018sexist\u2019 language won\u2019t make sexism disappear, any more than banning racial slurs killed racism", "language": "en", "text": "A Massachusetts congressman wants to end sexism by punishing sexist language - specifically the word \u201cb***h\u201d \u2013 with fines and even jail. But policing speech doesn't kill the underlying sentiment \u2013 that requires real social change.\n\nMassachusetts Democrat Daniel Hunt's bill to ban the \u201cb-word,\u201d fining offenders $150 on the first offense and $200 or six months in prison if they can't stop saying it, sounds like the kind of joke conservatives might make to poke fun at the uber-liberal Bay State. But the bill \u2013 titled \u2018An act regarding the use of offensive words\u2019 \u2013 is real. Worse, any witness to the use of the word can complain.\n\nA person who uses the word \u2018bitch\u2019 directed at another person to accost, annoy, degrade or demean the other person shall be considered to be a disorderly person.\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Triggered' liberals busy preaching PC dogma, as poor struggle to survive on America's mean streets\n\nHunt's bill, which he insists was submitted at the request of a constituent, is far from the only example of the Democratic Party clutching its pearls over speech while giving the sentiment beneath that speech a pass. A vocal segment of the Left has become notorious as America's \u201cspeech police,\u201d calling out offenses real and imagined on social media and inciting outrage mobs to force apologies out of celebrities and businesses, sometimes sincere but often perfunctory and defensive.\n\nCriminalizing \u201csexist\u201d language to curb sexism reverses cause and effect. Martin Luther King Jr. wouldn't have gotten very far during the Civil Rights era had he merely strived to end the use of racial slurs in order to achieve equality for the races. Such words are no longer acceptable to use because of significant organizing, marching, and other forms of protest from sit-ins to boycotts. Social change comes first \u2013 language is just a reflection of societal norms.\n\nYet liberals seem to have forgotten even that. College students and professors at the University of Connecticut turned out in protest earlier this week, demanding the arrest of two students who were overheard calling each other racial slurs in a vulgar word game. The mob didn't stop to realize that the slur \u2013 once a commonplace insult directed at black people \u2013 is now considered an obscenity thanks to the strides American society has made toward equality. The students were using it to shock \u2013 rather like someone yelling \u201cb***h\u201d in a public place.\n\nPoliticians should have a better grasp of history than college students, but this is not always the case. Earlier this week, Democratic congressman Al Green pounced on President Donald Trump for comparing his impeachment probe to a \u201clynching.\u201d Green, who is black, excoriated the president for appropriating his racial history \u2013 even though the word simply means an extrajudicial execution by a mob, and Democrats used it to defend their own president Bill Clinton during his impeachment in 1999.\n\nGreen's histrionics allowed Congress to avoid addressing the president's point \u2013 that his impeachment investigation was proceeding at record speed, with little regard for legal precedent, and that it put future presidents in jeopardy. This is the usual outcome of speech-policing: bringing down an outrage mob on the head of whoever used the forbidden word, while utterly obscuring the context and negating any point they may have been making.\n\nIt's not that there isn't room for improvement in the US with regard to gender and racial equality. Congress \u2013 should it desire \u2013 could pass laws to help reduce the racial disparities in criminal convictions and sentencing, instead of demanding (in California, at least) that felons be referred to as \u201cjustice-involved persons\u201d so as not to offend their delicate sensibilities.\n\nAlso on rt.com From \u2018felon\u2019 to \u2018justice-involved person\u2019: San Francisco fights crime with PC language\n\nIt could mandate paid maternity leave like the rest of the developed world, giving women more opportunities to advance in the workplace without penalizing them for giving birth; instead, some states (California again) mandate \u201cde-gendering\u201d of job titles like postman, policeman, and fireman. But playing speech-police is the easy way to signal virtue, while changing social norms is difficult.\n\nMassachusetts\u2019 \u2018b***h bill\u2019 is clearly unconstitutional, civil rights attorney Harvey Silverglate told the Herald, and fortunately Hunt is getting some pushback from his fellow legislators. Given the current state of affairs, though, it's only a matter of time before the speech police strike again.\n\nBy Helen Buyniski, RT\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "A Massachusetts congressman wants to end sexism by punishing sexist language - specifically the word \u201cb***h\u201d \u2013 with fines and even jail.
