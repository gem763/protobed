(Although \u201cranch girl\u201d Hanna Kinney reportedly leans left.)\n\nBut a less frivolous soundbite came from Gillibrand herself, in the last debate, conducted by CNN at the end of July. Gillibrand contended that \u201cas a white woman of privilege \u2026 I can talk to those white women in the suburbs that voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is, that when their son is walking down a street with a bag of M&Ms in his pocket, wearing a hoodie, his whiteness is what protects him from not [sic] being shot.\u201d\n\nIt would be hard to compose a statement more racially divisive, more prejudiced, or more sexist. Apparently, we\u2019re to understand that suburban white women are so shallow, they need it \u201cGillibrand-splained\u201d to them how it is that their sons don\u2019t arrive home riddled with bullets.\n\nShe Can Be \u2018Any Woman You\u2019ve Ever Imagined\u2019\n\nBut let\u2019s get beyond the \u201cdressing\u201d here, if you will. What Gillibrand was, and still is, running for is not president but vice president. That is if it\u2019s a man at the top of the Democrats\u2019 ticket. Because there simply has to be a woman somewhere on the Democratic presidential slate this time around, four years after the Hillary loss to Trump that was not supposed to be; the group politics that rule the party of Jefferson in the 21st century demand it.\n\nAnd Gillibrand has triangulated herself with a shamelessness that would bring a sly smile to the lips of her onetime friend Bill Clinton. She was appointed, not elected, to the U.S. Senate in 2009 to replace Hillary Clinton, who had made a deal to be secretary of state in the administration of her primary opponent, Barack \u201cTeam of Rivals\u201d Obama. The New York governor who appointed her himself hadn\u2019t been elected governor, but landed in the office when Eliot Spitzer\u2019s extramarital bad habits became public.\n\nGillibrand was a Democratic congresswoman representing a Republican district in Dutchess County in upstate New York, and actually boasted a 100% National Rifle Association rating. When her appointment was announced, none other than former longtime Republican New York Sen. Al D\u2019Amato, now a mercenary lobbyist, stood conspicuously nearby. New York Democrats wanted to bamboozle New Yorkers living north and northwest of New York City and affluent Westchester County into believing they wanted them to have some token representation for once.\n\nUpon moving across the Capitol to the Senate, her migration to the left happened faster than a knife fight in a phone booth, of course. But now, after a failed presidential campaign that didn\u2019t burn any bridges (even with a bumbling suggestion that Joe Biden is an anti-feminist), Gillibrand the shape-shifter can become \u201cany woman you\u2019ve ever imagined\u201d \u2013 whatever is needed in a 2020 running mate.\n\nIf \u201cmoderate\u201d Biden is nominated, Gillibrand can balance the ticket by being the rabid feminist who talks down to white suburban women who voted for Trump. If South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is nominated, she can be the upstate, rural, white, working homemaker with the 100% NRA rating who provides the homosexual-with-husband some connection to the quaint, more conventional America of a bygone era. Socialist Bernie Sanders as nominee could use some of that too.\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s even an outside chance that a California Sen. Kamala Harris nomination could make use of a less-left white woman as running mate.\n\nWhether it means being a Jekyl-brand or a Hyde, Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s just trying to get some power.\n\n\u2014 Written by Thomas McArdle\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
