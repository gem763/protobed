It has been rumoured that fears over a Corbyn government were key in billionaire inventor James Dyson's decision to move his HQ to Singapore.\n\nOther wealth creators are fleeing Britain in their thousands, for more tax-friendly regimes in Portugal and Italy where they can escape the prospect of predatory Marxism squeezing them 'until the pips squeak'.\n\nThe latest data from HMRC shows that in 2018, the number of 'non-doms' in Britain \u2013 those who pay a fee to avoid paying taxes on their overseas income \u2013 plunged by more than 12,000 to 78,300.\n\nWith the departure of these wealthy individuals also go thousands of ordinary service jobs, from florists to hairdressers. Just as importantly, when wealthy people flee, they take their money with them. That deprives the British economy of vital investment.\n\nAnalysts say that \u00a3782billion has already left UK investment funds amid concerns over the Corbyn threat. That number could rise far higher if the bearded Socialist were ever to get his hands on the levers of power.\n\nIt has been rumoured that fears over a Corbyn government were key in billionaire inventor James Dyson's decision to move his HQ to Singapore\n\nLittle wonder, therefore, that one of Prime Minister Corbyn's first acts would be to reinstate capital controls: rules to keep sterling assets being taken overseas.\n\nCorbyn and his Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell have a terrifying vision for Britain that would make any temporary loss of output from Brexit \u2013 even No Deal \u2013 look like a teddy bears' picnic.\n\nLabour's planned splurge would also likely obliterate Britain's cherished AA credit rating, leading to ever more overseas investors abandoning these shores and wreaking havoc on markets.\n\nThe threat to prosperity, jobs and stable markets posed by Corbyn and McDonnell's Marxist agenda cannot be overstated.\n\nOverwhelming evidence suggests a Corbyn government risks kicking away the underpinnings of our free-market economy and trapping Britain in a socialist slump.\n\nSuperficially, Labour's spending plans for the NHS, social care for the elderly and social housing, to be paid for by taxes on corporations and the 'wealthy' might not look very different from the Conservatives' plans.\n\nBut Labour's spending commitments are the tip of an economic iceberg that could bankrupt the nation. At the heart of their project is Marxist redistribution. Income, assets, ownership and power would all be re-allocated on a scale hitherto unseen in Britain.\n\nBoris Johnson's administration is heading into December's general election working hard to convince the electorate it can match Jeremy Corbyn's lavish rhetoric of spending on the NHS, social care for the elderly, education and crime and punishment\n\nThe country's rail and water companies, the Royal Mail and the electricity distribution firms would all be renationalised. And every British company with more than 250 workers would see 10 per cent of its assets grabbed. It would amount to the biggest threat to property rights and confiscation of assets in British history.\n\nBut that's not all. Among Labour's pledges are such radical ideas as a four-day week and a land-grab of large farms to make room for 'community agriculture'. This was pioneered in Zimbabwe and Venezuela, with disastrous consequences. The differing visions of Britain held by the two main parties could not be clearer. The Tories remain wedded to lower taxes and to a fiscal regime that the financial markets can trust.\n\nPreposterously, Labour seems to think it can raise taxes and spend liberally without any impact on enterprise and prosperity.\n\nThe Tories' approach, meanwhile, is to increase spending in government departments but without the politics of envy.\n\nUnder Javid's spending plans, every government department would benefit from a 4.1 per cent increase in spending in 2020-21, an increase of \u00a313.8billion.\n\nBut that is only the start. A huge infrastructure programme is also planned. The national living wage would be raised to \u00a310.50 by 2024.\n\nWhile the Tories' One Nation plans to increase spending come at a high price, the party also recognises that there is no room for economic recklessness. That is why, even as we head into an election, the party has as yet made no firm promises of tax cuts.\n\nThanks to Brexit dithering and a sharp deterioration in global economic conditions, whoever wins December's election faces an uphill struggle to rebuild economic confidence.\n\nThe governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, argues that a Brexit deal of the kind negotiated by Johnson could trigger recovery as pent-up business investment is released. Indeed, Carney has suggested the easing of trade tensions between the UK and Europe could lead to Britain leading the world out of its current sluggishness.\n\nHowever, Britain can take such a vital role only if businesses are reassured that Corbyn and his socialist acolytes are kept out of Downing Street.\n\nSome voters may well have concerns about the immediate economic impact of Brexit. But the terrifying alternative is of dangerous Marxist dogma destroying free-market capitalism and wiping out personal and national wealth.\n\nSuch a future does not bear thinking about.", "description": "ALEX BRUMMER: In his first major speech of the campaign today, Jeremy Corbyn is slated to take direct aim at a host of wealthy individuals including the Duke of Westminster.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/23/20401240-0-image-a-68_1572477140669.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
