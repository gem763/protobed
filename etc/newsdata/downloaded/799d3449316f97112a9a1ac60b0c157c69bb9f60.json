(CBC News/CBC Archives)\n\n\"To a man, they're impressed with the hockey program backed by the unlimited resources of the state,\" said CBC reporter Ron Laplante.\n\nAt the Red Army sports club in Moscow, the coaches looked on as a group of 11-year-olds who had been shown by \"scientific tests\" to have hockey potential played the game.\n\n\"So, their entire education is built around their hockey training,\" said Laplante, noting that some kids had started the program at as young as six years old.\n\nPlayers Vladislav Tretiak and Valeri Kharlamov, both Summit Series standouts, had honed their skills with the club.\n\n\"These kids are doing the same drills that the national team does,\" said a coach. \"Our guys, from 12 to 15 or 17, they don't get the same type of training.\"\n\n\"Where we're losing out, I think, is from [age] 12 on,\" said another.\n\n'Different ideologies'\n\nThe coaches watched and took notes as a group of 11-year-olds at the Red Army Sports Club played scrimmage.\n\nGathering knowledge about the Soviets' system was one thing.

In our country we have everybody involved.\"\n\nAs a group of boys in hockey jerseys carried weights and jumped from foot to foot behind him, Laplante summed up the coaches' conclusions.\n\n\"They feel that our system is standing still while the Russian one is moving ahead quickly,\" he said. \"In order to at least stay even with them, the time has come for us to make some changes.\"", "description": "A group of Canadian coaches travelled to Moscow in 1974 to figure out how the Russians got so good at hockey.", "authors": ["Cbc Archives"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5273239.1567783390!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hockey-coaches.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
