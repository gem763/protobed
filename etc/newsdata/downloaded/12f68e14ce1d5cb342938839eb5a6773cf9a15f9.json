Socialists of the world unite, right? Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) will announce that she will be endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Is this shocking? I mean the 2020 Democratic field is full of liberal clowns, but Bernie is a special breed. He\u2019s not a capitalist. He trashes the job-creating and investing class, thinks Amazon and other corporations are vehicles of evil, and pretty much has the same talking points book as AOC.\n\nThank you! There are too many plans out there that seem more interested in protecting corporate profits than protecting the lives of working Americans.\n\n\n\nWe need #MedicareForAll, and we need it now. https://t.co/Te8c8g0tJS \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 16, 2019\n\nTax the rich. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 16, 2019\n\nSanders has been struggling. He\u2019s recovering from a heart attack, he hasn\u2019t made any headway in the polls that point to him taking the top spot in the field, and the move he needs to make to clear some space for him\u2014attacking Elizabeth Warren\u2014he won\u2019t do. So, with AOC\u2019s endorsement, she could inject some new life into the campaign, as reported by The Washington Post. The announcement will be made official this Saturday at a rally, in which Ocasio-Cortez is set to make an appearance:\n\nNEWS: @AOC plans to endorse @berniesanders and appear with him at a rally in Queens, NY, on Saturday.\n\n\n\nHuge moment in the 2020 race.\n\n\n\nStory with @daveweigel: https://t.co/SloYtRUEYw \u2014 Sean Sullivan (@WaPoSean) October 16, 2019\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the most influential voices among young liberals and a rising Democratic star, plans to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president and appear with him at a rally on Saturday, according to two people with knowledge of her plans. The surprise endorsement is a political coup for Sanders, 78, who has been fading in the polls and has faced growing questions about his age and health. Before Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate, he had been sidelined from the campaign trail for two weeks by a heart attack. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to Saturday,\u201d said Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders teased the rally at Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate, saying he would have a \u201cspecial guest\u201d appearing with him in New York. Another person with knowledge of the congresswoman\u2019s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a decision that has not yet been announced publicly, confirmed the endorsement. Sanders campaign officials declined to comment.\n\nAOC is feisty but totally wrong on policy. She supports Sanders\u2019 soaking the rich approach, the Green New Deal, which is her pet policy project, and totally not someone who walks lockstep with the establishment. You saw that brawl erupt this summer between her and House Speaker Pelosi. Sanders is also an outsider, so it shouldn\u2019t shock us that AOC, the insurgent, is backing another candidate who will take a baseball bat to D.C., only this time with a left swing.", "description": ".10/15/2019 23:54:46PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/207/2b15e07f-ab31-4f66-af06-6f9fbc4920ed.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
