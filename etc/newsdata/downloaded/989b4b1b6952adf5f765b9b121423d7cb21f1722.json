Eight in 10 Americans live within five miles of one of the 15,000 eligible Western Union locations, Amazon said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re embracing the complexity of a world where cash and digital payments are likely to coexist far into the future,\u201d Khalid Fellahi, Western Union\u2019s president of consumer money transfer, said in a statement.\n\nThe feature rolls out to Americans in the coming weeks and has already been introduced in 19 countries including Chile, Costa Rica, Malaysia and Kenya. It marked Amazon\u2019s latest outreach to people who don\u2019t use credit or debit cards.\n\nThe retailer in 2017 introduced Amazon Cash, a no-fee service that lets customers add money to their Amazon accounts at partner stores like CVS Pharmacy CVS, -0.35% and 7-Eleven.\n\nBut paying with cash also makes us less willing to part with hard-earned money, research has long suggested.\n\n\u2018Twenty-four hours is a substantial amount of time to think about whether they actually want to go through with that purchase.\u2019 \u2014Consumer psychologist Peggy Sue Loroz\n\nAnd that day-long window during which Amazon PayCode customers can pay for their order could marry the breezy enjoyment of online shopping with the added ability to reconsider a purchase, Peggy Sue Loroz, a consumer psychologist and professor of marketing at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash., told MarketWatch. If customers don\u2019t pay for their order within the 24-hour window, their order is simply canceled, according to Amazon.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s not just an instantaneous decision, and there\u2019s basically that 24-hour cooling period before you actually execute on that transaction \u2014 I think that\u2019s very meaningful,\u201d Loroz said. \u201cTwenty-four hours is a substantial amount of time to think about whether they actually want to go through with that purchase.\u201d\n\nThis period of time to rethink an online purchase, she added, \u201cmight be most important for your typical cash-paying consumer\u201d who may come from an unbanked or lower-income household.\n\nIn fact, the system may leave Amazon with plenty of abandoned orders, added consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow, the author of \u201cDecoding the New Consumer Mind.\u201d \u201cIn the time it takes them to pay, they\u2019ll change their mind,\u201d she said.\n\nExpanding the accessibility of online shopping to cash-reliant consumers could also introduce greater potential for impulse-buying. While consumers still made 68% of impulse buys in-store in 2017, according to a CreditCards.com survey of 1,003 adults, the share of Americans who reported making most of their recent impulsive purchases online rose from one in five in 2016 to one in three in 2017.\n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t a country where we have such a narrow gap between rich and poor that we can all just do the same thing.\u2019 \u2014Sue Loroz, a professor of marketing at Gonzaga University\n\nStill, PayCode is a smart move by Amazon to expand its customer base to people who may not previously have considered online shopping a viable option, Loroz said, as well as a way to extend Amazon\u2019s availability beyond a higher-income and banked customer base.\n\nSome 6.5% of American households in 2017 were unbanked, meaning they had no savings or checking account, according to a survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. \u2014 the lowest level since the survey\u2019s inception in 2009. Lower-income and less-educated households had higher rates of unbanked status, FDIC\u2019s survey found. About two in three unbanked households reported using cash to pay bills.\n\nAmazon, for its part, cited a statistic from the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2018 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice, which found that 77% of payments are made in person, and 39% of those in-person transactions are made with cash. Cash constitutes 30% of all transactions and 55% of those below $10, the same report found.\n\nThe service also reflects the reality of income inequality in the U.S., which complicates the transition to a cashless economy, she said.\n\n\u201cWe have so many customers who aren\u2019t in a position to do that \u2014 who don\u2019t have access to, or are uncomfortable with, or are in other ways not really able to take advantage of banking services,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a country where we have such a narrow gap between rich and poor that we can all just do the same thing.\u201d\n\nAmazon stock is up 20.4% for the year to date and Western Union is up 33.1%, compared to a 16% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.13% and a 19.5% increase for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% over the same period.", "description": "\u2018There\u2019s basically that 24-hour cooling period before you actually execute on that transaction,\u2019 a consumer psychologist said.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR558_wester_ZG_20190918142407.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
