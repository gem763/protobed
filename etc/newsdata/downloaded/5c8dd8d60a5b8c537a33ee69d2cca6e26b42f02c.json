It is alleged that Zuma received 783 payments, totalling just over R4 million from his then financial adviser Schabir Shaik and his Nkobi group of companies between 1996 and 2005.", "description": "Former president Jacob Zuma\u2019s criminal trial, which was set to commence in the KwaZulu-Natal division of the South African High Court in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday after his application for a permanent stay of prosecution was denied last week, has b", "authors": ["Juniour Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9337/e1dbeba97c75447db9f25cd26a9ddcad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
