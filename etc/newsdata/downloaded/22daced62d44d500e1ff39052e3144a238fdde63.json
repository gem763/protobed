Previously they could offset all their mortgage interest on the property against rent and only pay income tax on the difference.\n\nThis is being scaled back to a maximum 20 per cent tax credit against mortgage interest, which will be in place fully from April. Total rental revenue is also now added to a landlord's income to decide their tax rate (rather than only profit after interest previously) potentially pushing them up a tax bracket.\n\nCapital gains tax change on the way\n\nOwner-occupiers are not subject to capital gains tax when they sell their home, thanks to principal private residence relief, but those selling investment properties are.\n\nThose who have to move home but are unable to sell, or need to let their home in order to rent elsewhere can be affected by this, so special reliefs were put in place.\n\nLandlords who have lived in the property they are now selling do not pay capital gains tax to the same extent that pure investors do when they sell.\n\nChange in the proportion of accidental landlords by region Region Proportion of homes let by accidental landlords Change in the past year London 10.1% -2.50% Wales 8% -0.30% North East 7.80% -1.70% North West 7.60% -1.40% East of England 6.20% -1.90% South East 6% -2.30% South West 5.80% -1.60% West Midlands 5.60% -0.60% Scotland 5.40% -0.40% East Midlands 5.30% -1.10% Yorkshire & Humber 5.10% -1.50%\n\nThe period that they lived in the property is exempt, along with a final period of ownership. This has already been scaled back and will be cut further.\n\nLast year, the then-Chancellor Philip Hammond announced changes to capital gains tax relief to this group, potentially affecting up to half a million landlords.\n\nThere are two main tax changes coming in April next year, to principal private residence relief and to letting relief, which adds an extra capital gains tax-cutting element.\n\nUnder current rules, provided that a property has at some point been the owner's only or main home, the last 18 months of ownership always qualify for principal private residence relief, whether or not the owner lived in the property during this period.\n\nThis is partly in place to capture the time it would take for the owner to sell the property.\n\nBut from next year, this 18 month exemption will be reduced to nine months.\n\nThat means that an additional nine months of gain may be subject to capital gains tax.\n\nFor the purpose of capital gains tax, the rise in the property's value during ownership is spread evenly across that period.\n\nAs an example of how this works, under the current rules a landlord who has owned their property for 10 years and lived in it for two would only be taxed on six-and-a-half years of capital gains \u2013 the 10 year period minus the two years of residency and the added 18 months' relief.\n\nFrom April next year, however, they'll be taxed on seven years and three months of capital gains \u2013 the 10 years, minus the two years residency plus the reduced nine months' relief.\n\nLettings relief will also be reduced. Currently, when a landlord sells their former home after renting it out, they can shelter up to \u00a340,000 of their gain from capital gains tax. For couples this can be up to \u00a380,000.\n\nThe current letting relief rules state that you can get the lowest of the following:\n\nthe same amount you got in Private Residence Relief\n\n\u00a340,000\n\nthe same amount as the chargeable gain you made from letting your home\n\nFrom April 2020, only landlords who currently live in the property with their tenants will qualify for letting relief.\n\nThese two tax changes combined could potentially cost landlords thousands of extra pounds when they move.\n\nThe tax grab is expected to raise \u00a3470million for the Treasury over five years according to accounting firm RSM, and could affect up to half a million so-called accidental landlords.\n\nThe tax grab is expected to raise \u00a3470million for the Treasury over five years according to RSM\n\nHow has this affected the rental market so far?\n\nThe report from Hamptons International found that the number of new 'accidental' landlords coming to market has fallen since the changes were introduced.\n\nThe proportion of homes that came onto the rental market having first been listed to sell within the previous six months peaked at 8.6 per cent in 2018 following five years of growth.\n\nHowever, this year that number fell to 7.1 per cent, the first fall since 2014 and the lowest level in five years.\n\nEvery region recorded a fall in the proportion of homes let by accidental landlords, with London seeing the biggest drop.\n\nYet London is still the accidental landlord capital of the country. So far this year 10.1 per cent of homes listed to rent in London had been up for sale during the previous six months, down from a peak of 12.6 per cent last year.\n\nThe South East recorded the second biggest fall in the proportion of homes coming to the rental market having been up for sale, with a 2.3 per cent year-on-year drop, followed by the East of England, with a 1.9 per cent drop.\n\nMeanwhile Scotland and Wales saw the smallest changes to the proportion of homes let by accidental landlords, with a drop of 0.4 per cent and 0.3 per cent respectively.\n\nAneisha Beveridge of Hamptons International, said: 'Despite a weaker sales market, which tends to encourage accidental landlords, the proportion of homes to let having previously been listed for sale has fallen for the first time in five years.\n\n'The tax changes being introduced in April 2020 will increase the capital gains tax bill for some accidental landlords who choose to sell after that date.\n\n'Great Britain's most expensive regions and where prices have risen the most, recorded the biggest fall in accidental landlords.\n\n'This is unsurprising given that landlords in these areas will have seen the greatest gains, which are likely to exceed the annual capital gains tax allowance, and therefore could see their tax bills rise the most.'", "description": "The proportion of homes to rent that were previously for sale has fallen from a peak of 8.6 per cent in 2018 to 7.1 per cent now, according to Hamptons International.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
