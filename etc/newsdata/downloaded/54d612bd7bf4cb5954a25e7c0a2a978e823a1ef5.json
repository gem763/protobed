These data were announced in an oral presentation at UEG Week 2019, held in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nData from over 1,000 biologic-na\u00efve patients with UC or CD receiving vedolizumab or an anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy (adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, or certolizumab pegol) were collected, with the incidence rate (per 100 person-years) for serious adverse events and serious infections estimated per cohort. The incidence rates for the first occurrence of a serious adverse event (vedolizumab: 4.6 [3.5-6.8]; anti-TNF\u03b1: 10.3 [9.5-14.9]) and serious infections (vedolizumab: 1.4 [0.8-2.5]; anti-TNF\u03b1: 2.6 [1.7-4.3]) were estimated to be lower with vedolizumab treatment.1 Also, gastrointestinal infections were estimated to be lower in vedolizumab-treated vs. anti-TNF\u03b1-treated patients (1.1% vs. 4.3%, respectively, p<0.01).1 Similar trends were observed when results were segmented by UC and CD.1*\n\n\u201cWhile retrospective chart reviews have limitations and are not conclusive, real-world evidence can enhance our understanding of the performance of treatments in clinical practice, providing valuable information to assist physicians in the selection of appropriate therapy for patients. Sharing the latest real-world evidence, such as the EVOLVE study, with scientific and clinical communities, forms an integral part of Takeda\u2019s ongoing commitment towards improving patient care,\u201d said Michelle Luo, PhD, Head of Global Outcomes Research-Gastroenterology, Takeda.\n\nThe EVOLVE study is one of nine Takeda vedolizumab abstracts accepted for presentation at the annual UEG Week congress, with new data being presented from clinical studies that assess the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab, as well as new evaluations to understand the role of clinical decision support tools in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n* Data revised following abstract acceptance\n\nAbout the EVOLVE Study\n\nThe EVOLVE study was a retrospective chart review of real-world data in biologic-na\u00efve patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) treated with vedolizumab or anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF\u03b1) therapies. Patients had initiated treatment with vedolizumab or anti-TNF\u03b1 therapies (adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, or certolizumab pegol) between May 2014 and March 2018 and were followed for \u2265six months. Evidence was collected from 1,095 biologic-na\u00efve patients from 42 sites in Canada, Greece and the United States; 598 were treated with vedolizumab (UC=380; CD=218), and 497 were treated with anti-TNF\u03b1 therapies (UC=224; CD=273).1 A Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for baseline patient characteristics was used to compare incidence rates between treatment cohorts.2\n\nA retrospective chart review is a type of research design in which patient medical records are collected from real-world clinical practice to answer research questions.3,4 The data evaluated were collected before the research had begun, and therefore were not originally intended for investigative purposes nor to answer specific research questions. While retrospective chart reviews are important for advancing physician understanding of the performance of treatments in clinical practice, the records reviewed may not be complete and as such chart reviews can be more prone to bias as compared to prospective studies.4\n\nAbout Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn\u2019s Disease\n\nUlcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) are two of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).5 Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that are often progressive in nature.6,7 UC only involves the large intestine as opposed to CD, which can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus.8,9 CD can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall, while UC only involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.7,8 UC commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort and loose bowel movements, including blood or pus.8,10 CD commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.6 The cause of UC or CD is not fully understood; however, recent research suggests hereditary, genetic, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to UC or CD.8,11,12\n\nAbout Entyvio\u00ae (vedolizumab)\n\nVedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved as an intravenous (IV) formulation.13,14 It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).15 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.16 The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.15 These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD).15,17,18 By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.15\n\nVedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) antagonist.13,14 Vedolizumab IV has been granted marketing authorization in over 60 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 330,000 patient years of exposure to date.19\n\nTherapeutic Indications\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nVedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) antagonist.\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease\n\nVedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) antagonist.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nContraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\n\nSpecial warnings and special precautions for use\n\nVedolizumab should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering vedolizumab. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\n\nIn clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.\n\nInfections\n\nVedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity. Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. Although no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects, the effects on systemic immune system function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not known. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.\n\nMalignancies\n\nThe risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.\n\nPrior and concurrent use of biological products\n\nNo vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.\n\nVaccinations\n\nPrior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nAdverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in extremities, pyrexia, fatigue and anaphylaxis.\n\nPlease consult with your local regulatory agency for approved labeling in your country.\n\nFor U.S. audiences, please see the full Prescribing Information including Medication Guide for ENTYVIO\u00ae.\n\nFor EU audiences, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for ENTYVIO\u00ae.\n\nTakeda\u2019s Commitment to Gastroenterology\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) diseases can be complex, debilitating and life-changing.
