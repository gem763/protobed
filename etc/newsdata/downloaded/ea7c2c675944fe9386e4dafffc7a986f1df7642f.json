The big question is what kind of clues the central bank offers about any more rate reductions.\n\nHints could be provided in the Fed\u2019s new policy statement and economic projections, to be released at 2 p.m. EDT, and at Chairman Jerome Powell \u2019s press conference at 2:30 p.m. Here\u2019s what to watch:\n\nThe Outlook\n\nOfficials cited three reasons\u2014weakening global growth, rising trade policy uncertainty and muted inflation\u2014for cutting rates at their July 30-31 meeting and are likely to do so again this week. The U.S.-China trade war worsened immediately after the July meeting, and the global industrial downturn shows no sign of bottoming out. Both point to another cut this week.\n\nOfficials expected the U.S. economy to slow this year, but increased uncertainty means officials aren\u2019t sure if the economy is going to cool a little bit or a lot.\n\nU.S. economic data paint a mixed picture. Consumer spending has been solid, but manufacturing has weakened. Recent revisions to employment and profit growth shows the economy over the past year wasn\u2019t as strong as previously thought.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What are you hoping comes out of this meeting? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe Dot Plot\n\nBecause the rate cut is expected, attention will quickly move to the quarterly interest-rate projections, the so-called dot plot, and Mr. Powell\u2019s press conference.\n\nAs in the past, the dot plot remains a potential source of confusion. The projection of rate cuts for 2019 carries added significance because there are only two meetings left this year, meaning it provides a strong indication of officials\u2019 expected near-term policy path.\n\nIn June, seven of 17 officials penciled in two rate cuts this year. Having delivered those cuts now, the big question is how many of them will project at least one more rate reduction this year.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that at least eight participants will project a third cut this year, which would represent the median expectation. It seems equally possible that a substantial minority will pencil in another cut.\n\nMr. Powell has warned repeatedly this year against reading too much into the dots and could do so again if the median projection seems out of step with his overarching message.\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nMr. Powell puzzled some investors at his July press conference when he characterized the rate cut as a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d instead of the start of the kind of \u201clong cutting cycle\u201d the Fed adopts in a recession.\n\nHis phrase was intended to draw parallels to two separate episodes in 1995 and 1998 when the Fed cut rates three times over several months and avoided recession. But some listeners took it to mean the Fed might be done cutting rates or that it was underestimating the severity of the potential slowdown.\n\nMr. Powell has since steered clear of repeating the phrase and seems unlikely to repeat it again on Wednesday. But his broader point hasn\u2019t much changed: Officials don\u2019t think they are in a recession-fighting stance that would entail a longer, aggressive series of cuts.\n\nInvestors will want clues about how long the rate cuts could go on. Because officials have little experience dealing with a trade war, they may not offer much specificity.\n\nCommittee Tensions\n\nThe degree of consensus or division on the committee will also help shape expectations about the rate outlook.\n\nMr. Powell faced resistance to the July rate cut from around half of the Fed\u2019s 12 reserve bank presidents. Two of them with a vote on the rate-setting committee\u2014Boston\u2019s Eric Rosengren and Kansas City\u2019s Esther George \u2014dissented then in favor of holding rates steady because they didn\u2019t think the U.S. economy needed the extra boost. Because the economy hasn\u2019t deteriorated since then, they could vote Wednesday against another rate cut.\n\nMeantime, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said two weeks ago in an interview he would support cutting rates by a larger half-point because of a sharp fall in market-determined rates since the last meeting. This suggests he might vote Wednesday against a quarter-point reduction.\n\nSome bond investors say a larger cut, by weakening the dollar and boosting expectations of future inflation, would deliver more convincing evidence that the Fed was committed to lift inflation more rapidly to its 2% target.\n\nMost Fed officials haven\u2019t been swayed by these arguments. Several worry it could look panicky and would encourage markets to demand or expect more stimulus.\n\nCash Crunch\n\nThe New York Fed injected cash into money markets on Tuesday and planned to do so again Wednesday after overnight rates spiked due to technical factors, including declines in bank reserves held at the Fed.\n\nThe rate volatility creates urgency for the Fed to resolve longstanding questions over a set of complex monetary plumbing issues.\n\nOfficials ended their portfolio runoff last month, but they haven\u2019t said when they will allow their asset holdings to grow in step with demand for their liabilities, which include currency in circulation. Until then, the amount of money banks hold at the Fed\u2014called reserves\u2014will continue to decline.\n\nThey could allow their portfolio to grow again by purchasing a small amount of Treasurys every month to end the slow decline in reserves.\n\nThey could cut the interest rate paid to banks on excess reserves, something they have done three times in the past to increase liquidity in other short-term lending markets.\n\nThey could also become more involved in supporting money markets by creating a new standing facility that would reduce volatility in participants\u2019 demand for cash. Officials debated creating a facility in June but didn\u2019t reach a final decision.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "description": "The Federal Reserve is likely to cut its short-term benchmark rate at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.
