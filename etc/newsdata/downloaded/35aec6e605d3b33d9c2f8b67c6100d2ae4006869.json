REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File Photo\n\nThe man former U.S. President Barack Obama privately anointed as a successor in global diplomacy survived a blackface scandal and the disclosure that he sought to interfere with a federal corruption prosecution, but just barely.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberals, who won power four years ago with a strong parliamentary majority, were projected by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp to form a minority government after a tight election battle with the Conservative Party led by Andrew Scheer. That would leave Trudeau needing the support of smaller opposition parties to govern.\n\n\u201cThe hype was so great when he ran before, it would be hard to match that,\u201d said Jonathan Rose, a political science professor at Queen\u2019s University. \u201cThe burden of governing both wore him down and wore voters down.\u201d\n\nAlternately charming and awkward, the former teacher and snowboard instructor swept to power in 2015 at the age of 43. Born on Christmas Day in 1971 to a sitting Canadian prime minister, Pierre Trudeau, the younger Trudeau grew up in the spotlight.\n\nOn taking over as prime minister, Trudeau said he would tackle climate change, overhaul the electoral system, legalize marijuana and have Canada take in 25,000 Syrian refugees. He proclaimed himself a feminist, and unveiled a gender-balanced Cabinet. Mobbed for selfies, Trudeau brought style to an office that is usually dour, and broadcast much of it on social media.\n\nBut before long, key allies turned hard to the right - the UK voted to leave the European Union, and the United States elected Republican Donald Trump as president.\n\nIn time, Trudeau concentrated power in the prime minister\u2019s office and abandoned electoral reform. His government bought the troubled Trans Mountain oil pipeline, infuriating environmentalists, even as it moved to put a price on carbon, alienating the energy industry.\n\nThe run-up to the campaign was marked by high-profile Cabinet defections, and a watchdog report that found Trudeau and his team tried to undermine a federal prosecutor\u2019s decision to put construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc (SNC.TO) on trial for corruption.\n\nThen, as the campaign began, a 2001 photograph emerged that showed Trudeau, then 29, at a party, his face covered in dark makeup. More photographs of him in blackface quickly followed, as Trudeau apologised. The images, which briefly dented the Liberals\u2019 popularity, ran counter to a carefully managed public persona.\n\nTrudeau also promised \u201creconciliation\u201d with Canada\u2019s indigenous peoples, who make up about 5% of the country.\n\nAhead of Monday\u2019s election, the indigenous political group Assembly of First Nations (AFN) said there had been \u201cconcrete action and investments\u201d but \u201cwe have considerable ground to make up to ensure First Nations and Canadians share an equal quality of life.\u201d\n\n\u2018VOICE TO BE NEEDED MORE\u2019\n\nOn the eve of the election, the race looked close. Trudeau had a shot at a dispiriting honour: the first prime minister since 1935 to lose power in the next election after winning a first-term majority.\n\n\u201cIt was inevitable that some of that shine was going to come off, and I think we\u2019ve seen that,\u201d said Andrew MacDougall, who was spokesman for former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, whose Conservative government was ousted by Trudeau\u2019s Liberals in 2015. \u201cBut he\u2019s not that far away from where he was when he was elected.\u201d\n\nJustin Trudeau looks at his son Hadrien Trudeau at his polling place before he casts his ballot for today's election in the Papineau area of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, October 21, 2019.

The two were spotted dining together in Ottawa earlier this year, and the former president tweeted his endorsement last Wednesday of Trudeau\u2019s re-election.\n\nIn a recent book, former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes described a 2016 meeting between the two leaders.\n\n\u201cJustin, your voice is going to be needed more,\u201d Obama said, according to Rhodes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to speak out when certain values are threatened.\u201d", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held on to his job in Monday's election, securing his spot as one of the world's few high-profile progressive leaders, but tarnished by scandal and with his power diminished.", "authors": ["Allison Martell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443580709&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L07O", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
