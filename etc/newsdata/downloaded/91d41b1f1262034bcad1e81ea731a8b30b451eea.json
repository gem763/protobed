Thank you, next.\u2019\n\nIn September, Instagram finally took a step in the right direction by restricting the promotion of diet products to under 18s and outright banning any product that \u2018makes a miraculous claim about certain diet or weight loss products, and is linked to a commercial offer such as a discount code.\u2019 Yes!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about the change, Jameela said: \u2018Facebook and Instagram taking a stand to protect the physical and mental health of people online sends an important message out to the world.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m thrilled to have been able to work towards this with them, alongside a host of other experts who shed light on the danger of these products.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
