We are willing to work constructively with PM Johnson and to look at any proposals that he may have as long as they are compatible with the withdrawal agreement,\" she said.\n\nThe commission planning document warned that the chaos in Westminster was making no deal more likely.\n\n\"The short time remaining and the political situation in the United Kingdom have increased the risk that the United Kingdom will withdraw on that date without an agreement,\" the European Commission said as it issued its final preparations for a chaotic \"no-deal\" Brexit.\n\nAs part of its contingency planning, the commission is to throw open the EU solidarity fund -- a mechanism normally used after floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters -- to mitigate the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit.", "description": "The EU said Wednesday it currently sees no alternative to the so-called \"Irish backstop\" in a Brexit withdrawal deal and warned the risk of Britain crashing out without an agreement has increased.
