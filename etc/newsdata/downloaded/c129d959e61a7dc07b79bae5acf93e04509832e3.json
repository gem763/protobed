On Tuesday investors bought and sold more pounds than on any single day since November 2018, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nLondon-listed companies that make their cash at home, from housebuilders to banks, on Wednesday reversed some of the ground gained since last week.\n\nThese domestically focused stocks, some of the world's most unloved shares in recent years, have seen their fortunes transform since Friday - JPMorgan's domestic basket has outperformed London-listed exporter peers and the blue-chip FTSE 100.\n\nBritain's mid-cap stocks index FTSE 250 cut its losses from the morning and was last down 0.2%. Ireland's main stocks index was nearly flat.\n\n\"UK equities have started to look more interesting. We've been on the negative side for some time, (but) I wouldn't be so pessimistic there any more because valuations have started to look more attractive. A lot of bad stuff is priced in,\" said Legal & General Investment Management strategist Lars Kreckel.\n\n\"If the Brexit issue were to disappear or become less prominent, you could have some flows returning to UK equities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading in sterling options suggested high volatility in the currency was likely one way or another.\n\nBritish government bonds benefited from the renewed uncertainty, with 10-year yields broadly flat on the day at 0.69%.\n\nWith the spotlight on Brexit, September inflation data had little market impact. Britain's inflation rate failed to rise as expected last month as petrol prices fell at the fastest rate in more than three years, a boost to consumers ahead of Brexit.\n\n(Reporting by the London Markets Team; Editing by Tommy Wilkes, Alison Williams and Hugh Lawson)", "description": "Sterling swung around five-month highs and stocks in London fell on Wednesday amid a blizzard of contradictory headlines about whether Britain and the European Union were on the verge of agreeing a Brexit deal.
