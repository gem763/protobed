No specific details of Day\u2019s injuries were provided by the promoter.\n\nConwell asked his social media followers to pray for Day\u2019s recovery. \u201cKeep him in your prayers!! #prayforpatrickday,\u201d he wrote on his Twitter page.\n\n\u201cPat Day makes any room he is in a better place. Never saw him greet someone without a big smile,\u201d DiBella wrote on Twitter. \u201cLife doesn\u2019t seem fair sometimes. Please keep Pat in your prayers, thoughts and hearts.\u201d\n\nDay was unconscious when he was taken from the ring in a stretcher and loaded onto a waiting ambulance. He suffered a seizure in the ambulance and needed a breathing tube once he arrived at the hospital.\n\nConwell, a 2016 American Olympian, was dominating the fight dropping Day in the fourth and eighth rounds and then landing a right hand in the 10th which caused Day to stumble.\n\nSeconds later he rocked Day with a massive left hook that resulted in Day falling backwards and his head bouncing off the canvas. Referee Celestino Ruiz called off the fight at one minute, 46 seconds of the round.\n\nDay lay on the canvas for several minutes while receiving medical treatment before being removed from the ring.\n\nDay was coming off a loss in June to Carlos Adames in New York. He has 17 wins and four losses and one draw in his pro career which began in 2013.\n\nDay was fighting on the undercard of Russian Dmitry Bivol\u2019s successful World Boxing Association light-heavyweight world title defence over Lenin Castillo.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 American boxer Patrick Day was fighting for his life in critical condition in hospital on Sunday night after lapsing into a coma", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/c74544_us-boxer-patrick-day-was-in-coma-in-critical-condition-sunday-night-24-hours-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
