Is the whistleblower\u2019s account devastating? Or perhaps Pelosi is playing a double game. It is well known that the Democratic machine is not altogether happy with Biden, by far the frontrunner to win their party nomination in 2020. By trying to impeach Trump for his attempt to unearth dirt on Sloppy Joe, the Democrats inevitably remind everyone that Biden is not the straight arrow he pretends to be.\n\nPelosi is a wily operator, yet that theory might be too clever by half. The more likely scenario is that the Democrats have, once again, allowed the apoplexy they feel towards Trump to flood their brains. They have got swept up in their own reality TV show, the one in which they get to save the republic. Pelosi has said before that she would rather beat Trump at the ballot than impeach him. But she has to speak for her Congressional majority, and now 196 excitable Democratic lawmakers are calling for impeachment. She\u2019s caved.\n\nBut the obsession with \u2018getting\u2019 Trump is self-defeating to the point of madness. The Trump-Ukraine scandal will not lead to Trump being forced from office: to be impeached, two-thirds of the Senate must vote against the President and Republicans currently have the Senate majority. Congressional Democrats think they can humiliate Trump in the court of public opinion and thus damage him and the Republicans ahead of 2020. They forget that Trump has no shame and the public regards all politicians as contemptible.", "description": "", "authors": ["Freddy Gray", "Spectator.Us Impeachment-Democrats-Addicted-Chaos"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
