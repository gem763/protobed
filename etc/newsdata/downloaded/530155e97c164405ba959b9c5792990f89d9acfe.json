Cantonese Pop Diva Denise Ho Wants the World to Stand Up With Hong Kong", "language": "en", "text": "Geneva, Sydney, Taipei, New York\u2014at another point in Denise Ho\u2019s career these might have been stops on a concert tour. Instead, the Cantonese pop diva turned icon of Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement has been traveling around the world drumming up support for her city\u2019s struggle against authoritarian China.\n\nHo has spent the last five years hitching her stardom to Hong Kong\u2019s democracy fight, and in response, has been banned from the lucrative mainland Chinese market and dropped from sponsorship deals and by her record label.\n\nAs a singer, Ho hit the mainstream in the 2000s. Then, in 2012, she was the first major female star in Hong Kong to come out, and began advocating for LGBT+ rights. In 2014, she was arrested for joining the \u201cUmbrella Revolution,\u201d a protest movement calling for free elections and an end to Beijing\u2019s encroachment on semi-autonomous Hong Kong.\n\nAmid the enclave\u2019s latest political upheaval, Ho continues to be one of the most prominent celebrities on the front lines. When she\u2019s not calling on the U.N. Human Rights Council to drop China from the international body, Ho can be spotted sporting the protester\u2019s black t-shirt uniform and joining the chants of \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time.\u201d\n\nTIME caught up with Ho on the sidelines of the Oslo Freedom Forum in Taipei, Taiwan last week.\n\nYou\u2019ve paid a price for your political activism. Do you feel more Hongkongers are now also having to choose between their careers and political views?\n\nFor sure. The main thing we can see is that people are restraining themselves from speaking their minds, not only public figures and celebrities, but also really anyone who might, say, travel to China, or who might be working in the corporate [sector]. I have close friends who are scared to even take a photo with me. So you see this kind of fear and self-censorship, and it is a very dangerous thing really, because that is how Communist governments always work. They instill fear and then people do these things on their own.\n\nYou\u2019ve said the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 framework Beijing uses to govern Hong Kong is doomed. What do you mean?\n\nThis is a very fundamental conflict, where two very different sets of values [clashed]. It actually worked quite well for some time, not even that far [back]. In 2012, when I came out in Hong Kong I expected to be blacklisted in China, but I wasn\u2019t. At that time, it was before the [President] Xi Jinping era. We even got a social media campaign going on [Chinese social media platform] Weibo, with people holding signs supporting the LGBT community. At the time, we were even hoping that the Communist Party was actually improving, loosening up. But then Xi Jinping took over with his very emperor-style of governing and controlling the population. It\u2019s been downhill ever since.\n\nSo what\u2019s the alternative?\n\nI know that a lot of young people think that we should just basically go toward independence. But at this moment in 2019, I don\u2019t see how we can do that right away. Maybe in 20 or 30 years the whole environment could be different. Anything could happen really with China facing external and also internal problems. From the way that they have been putting their propaganda machine at full speed, I do think they know that they are not in a very favorable situation and they are feeling the pressure. We need to keep the fight on, and just wait for something to shift.\n\nThe majority of people are not actually asking for Hong Kong independence. The five demands that we are voicing are very clear, and within that we are asking for political reform, real universal suffrage, where we can elect our own chief executive.\n\nWhy should people around the world care about what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong?\n\nThis is a global fight. We are a front line trying to preserve universal values\u2014freedom, justice, equality and human rights\u2014that are common to a lot of the more progressive societies, especially Western societies. Chinese influences have been reaching out and infiltrating different corners of the world. You see them coming into different areas with their economic power and then also, at the same time, their Communist values, where they do not allow anyone to criticize them. Corporations and institutions are succumbing to this kind of intimidation. That is something that should be very worrying for anyone really. If you are someone who believes in universal values, then you are part of this fight that has brought Hongkongers onto the streets for three months.", "description": "\"If you are someone who believes in universal values, then you are part of this fight\"", "authors": ["Laignee Barron"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/i8snWQSp22ctYzPXR0emVg--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/c3ee835383edd6d693f0f256a7f2e847", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
