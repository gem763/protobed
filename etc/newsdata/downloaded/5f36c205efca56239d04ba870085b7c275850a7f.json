Come on, man. This is a free man talking.\n\n\"Democrats had us voting for Democrats with food stamps for years. What are you talking about guns in the 80s, taking the fathers out the home, Plan B, lowering our votes, making us abort children.\"\n\nIn his rant, he mentioned Plan B, a brand of morning after pill, and appeared to confuse it with abortion.\n\n(Image: ABACA/PA Images)\n\nHe's now come under fire from bosses at FCH, the company which makes the pill, and heads of Planned Parenthood - an organisation which provides services including birth control and abortion.\n\nA representative for FCH told TMZ : \"Plan B emergency contraception is a safe and effective backup option when used as directed after unprotected sex or birth control failure.\n\n\"Plan B helps prevent pregnancy before it starts by delaying ovulation. Plan B is not an abortion pill \u2013 it will not harm an existing pregnancy and it will not be effective if a woman is already pregnant.\"\n\nA rep for Planned Parenthood added that black women should be given the chance to make their own decisions, especially when it comes to reproductive rights.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThey said: \"As black women, we make our own decisions about our bodies and pregnancies, and want and deserve to have access to the best medical care available.\n\n\"Misinformation like this is meant to shame us and keep us from making our own health care decisions.\n\n\"Black women want and deserve support and access to the full range of reproductive health care, but this persistent lie is threatening our ability to obtain it.\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWest has been open about his support for Republican president Donald Trump , and during the interview, he was asked whether backing the controversial leader was an endorsement of racism.\n\nThe music superstar replied: \"The most racist thing a person can tell me is that I'm supposed to choose something based on my race\".\n\nStatistics released after the 2016 election, which was won by Trump, suggested 88 per cent of black Americans voted Democrat while just eight per cent voted republican.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
