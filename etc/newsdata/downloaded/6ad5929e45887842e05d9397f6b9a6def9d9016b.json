But fans of Moja Love reality talk show Rea Tsotella are now seeing another side of Bishop Israel Makamu on TV.\n\nThis time, instead of unpacking the private lives of others, viewers are given a glimpse into the pastor\u2019s own life and that of his church business.\n\nThe 13-part reality show, I Am Bishop I Mokamu, started airing on Moja Love on 2 July. In it the 41-year-old preacher takes viewers through his life as a family man and looks at the politics of the church, among other things.\n\nWe drive into a secured upmarket estate in the south of Johannesburg where Israel lives with his wife, Hloniphile Makamu (34), and children, Ntwanano (12), Ntokozo (10) and Ntsumi (1).\n\nThe older children are one their way back from school and the youngest is with the nanny in the playroom upstairs. The grey double-storey mansion is far from modest, with large glass windows and a well maintained garden.\n\nBut the bishop isn\u2019t too keen on us taking snaps of his home. \u201cI don\u2019t like showing off my house because I\u2019m not a flashy guy. I\u2019m just a regular guy from ekasi,\u201d he says. \u201cI avoid bragging about the things God\u2019s blessed me with.\u201d And blessings there are aplenty.\n\nAa we\u2019re talking Hloniphile is in front of the cameras, shooting diary scenes for the reality show. \u201cMoja Love approached me to do the show because they wanted someone who was a prominent speaker and they chose me and I obliged,\u201d Israel says. The reality show reveals his day-to-day activities and he introduces a few of his famous friends.\n\n\u201cI feature Sipho Makhabane, Tinah Zungu, Keke Phoofolo and many other gospel greats who are close to me,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI want viewers to see that even men and women of God are normal people who deal with everyday issues. \u201cAnd we talk about everything because they\u2019re like my brothers.\u201d\n\nThe first episode features young couples in counselling as they discuss challenges in their marriages. \u201cEvery episode needs to teach people something. It\u2019s a positive projection of the church,\u201d Israel says.\n\n\u201cBut it won\u2019t be boring, I can tell you that. Expect a lot of drama and issues that a lot of pastors don\u2019t address. Like the issue of money and church.\n\n\u201d Israel says he\u2019s leaving no stone unturned. \u201cI won\u2019t show myself as a perfect bishop. I want people to see conflicts with my wife at home and how we handle them,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI talk about money and why I have a speed point at my church,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, if a nightclub or a tavern can have a speed point, why can\u2019t the church have one too? \u201cAs much as the church is a place of healing and worship, it\u2019s also a business.\n\nI get a salary from my church like a doctor does at his practice.\u201d Israel has 14 churches across the country and 84 employees in total.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a businessman and people will see I\u2019m not here to play games,\u201d he says.\n\nThe man of the church is often judged for his non-conventional style of preaching and speaking in Tsotsitaal, but he\u2019s quick to point out this way of thinking must change.\n\n\u201cWho says I can\u2019t speak the way I do? People think they\u2019re mini Jesuses on Earth and that they can judge people\u2019s ways of speaking or dressing.\u201d Israel graduated with a diploma in theology from the Christian Family Church International (CFCI) Bible College, but he hates talking like a textbook. \u201cMy gift comes naturally and Bible school was just a bonus,\u201d he says.\n\nAs he\u2019s about to go into full preaching mode his wife walks into the room wearing a red dress. \u201cLook at my queen,\u201d he says proudly. He and Hloniphile met in Katlehong in 2003 and married in 2005.\n\n\u201cI remember that day very well. I\u2019d just dropped off a friend and I saw her standing by the traffic lights,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cI stopped the car and got out to speak to her. \u201cI\u2019d never approached a woman before. It took me almost a week to get her attention.\n\nI had to follow her around and wait for her at the taxi stop before I could speak to her properly.\u201d He was nervous because he hadn\u2019t asked a woman out before. But he persevered because in Hloniphile he\u2019d seen a wife.\n\nAt the time she was 19 and studying nursing at Ann Latsky Nursing College in Joburg.\n\n\u201cI was the first person to be a bornagain Christian in my family and when I met my husband, he was also a person of the church,\u201d she tells us. \u201cSo he and I spoke the same language.\u201d Yet although they prayed and attended church together, Hloniphile never thought she\u2019d end up with a pastor.\n\n\u201cI wanted the usual things \u2013 a job, a house, a husband, family and children. I was nervous when he asked me to marry him and told me he was preparing to be a pastor,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI was nervous about being Mam\u2019fundisi [a bishop\u2019s wife].\u201d But she accepted it because \u201cit was my calling from God\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work but it was all God\u2019s plan for my journey.\u201d While studying nursing she decided also to study theology, but it didn\u2019t work to do both. \u201cIt was too much pressure for me to be doing two courses and I wanted to complete nursing, so I put theology on hold in the second year.\u201d She\u2019s planning to complete her studies next year.\n\nI SRAEL couldn\u2019t be prouder. \u201cEvery calling is a gift from God. Even in nursing, my wife is helping others,\u201d he says.\n\nHe\u2019s a strong believer in helping those less fortunate and says being a TV presenter and a pastor are the same. \u201cYou speak to people to make a positive change in their lives. One is just on a Sunday on the pulpit while the other\u2019s on TV.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t always a pastor but the former operations manager grew up in the church. His father, Titus Makamu, who died in 2017, was a pastor and so is his mom, Rophinia, who\u2019s still active in the church.\n\n\u201cI started preaching in secondary school and my peers started calling me Bishop in high school,\u201d he says. \u201cWhenever there was a prayer that needed to be said, they relied on me.\u201d\n\nBut growing up in Katlehong as a pastor\u2019s child wasn\u2019t easy and he was under the kind of pressure he hopes be able to to shield his children from.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a pastor\u2019s child you\u2019re expected to be perfect. I was far from perfect. I didn\u2019t drink or smoke and I was family oriented but there were times when I didn\u2019t feel like going to church or being involved in church activities.\n\n\u201cAnd that was considered to be rebellious. Maybe that\u2019s what helped me to understand people\u2019s differences. \u201cThank goodness I turned out okay.\u201d", "description": "Bishop Israel Makamu is already a familiar face on Moja Love.
