The agreement expires in 2047.\n\nConcerns about overt Chinese influence in Hong Kong have heightened in recent months, as protests -- which began this summer over a now-shelved extradition bill, but have since morphed into sweeping calls for reform -- have grown increasingly violent.\n\nProtests, now in their 19th straight week, descended into violence again on Wednesday, with reports that the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, the group responsible for some of the largest peaceful protests so far, was attacked for the second time.\n\nDemosisto, a separate pro-democracy organization, said in a tweet that Jimmy Shamm was smashed over the head with hammers. It\u2019s unclear who attacked Sham. A police source told the South Morning China Post that he was bleeding from his head and arms when officers discovered him. An investigation is underway.\n\nWARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Foreign Ministry spokesperson\u00a0Geng Shuang said it demonstrated a \"stark double standard.\"", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Hong-Kong-4.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
