Someone yells out, 'shoot them.'\"\n\nEL PASO SHOOTER INDICTED ON CAPITAL MASS SHOOTING CHARGE\n\nO'Rourke continued: \"The crowd roars their assent. The president smiles and he laughs his consent. What the president of the United States is doing cannot be more dangerous. He has the blood of those 22 people in El Paso on his hands. And, the answer to this has got to be beyond defeating Donald Trump, as important as it is. It has to go to the root of this problem.\"\n\nO'Rourke went on to name white supremacy as an \"existential threat.\"\n\nVideo of the Trump rally showed that Trump started discussing a migrant caravan making its way to the southern border: \"Don\u2019t forget, we don\u2019t let them and we can\u2019t let them use weapons. Other countries do. We can\u2019t. I would never do that.\"\n\nAfter someone yelled, \"shoot them,\" Trump smiled, shook his head, and replied, \"That\u2019s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement.\"\n\nThe National Review's Rich Lowry wrote that the president, in context, clearly was joking.\n\n\"Clearly, this is not meant as an endorsement of the statement, but a good-natured way to acknowledge its outrageousness,\" Lowry wrote. \"The idea that this shouted interruption, in the midst of a long Trump riff about how we need to make lawful changes to address the border crisis, somehow constitutes presidential incitement to mass murder is manifestly absurd.\"\n\nTEXAS REP WARNS O'ROURKE: 'MY AR IS READY FOR YOU, ROBERT FRANCIS'\n\nO'Rourke has flip-flopped on the issue of gun confiscation. When he was running for the Senate last year in Texas, he explicitly opposed the government taking AR-15 rifles. But, during last week's presidential primary debate, O'Rourke said flatly, \"hell yes,\" when asked if the government should confiscate AR-15s.\n\nThe former Texas representative later clarified that he did not anticipate the need for government agents to go door-to-door, because people simply would comply with the law voluntarily.\n\nLast Thursday, Briscoe Cain, a Republican in the Texas House of Representatives, posted an incendiary message on Twitter after O\u2019Rourke promised to take away citizens' guns.\n\n\u201cMy AR is ready for you Robert Francis,\u201d Cain responded, using O\u2019Rourke\u2019s birth name.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThis is a death threat, Representative,\u201d O\u2019Rourke wrote back. \u201cClearly, you shouldn\u2019t own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else.\u201d\n\nCain replied: \u201cYou\u2019re a child Robert Francis.\u201d\n\nFox News' Andrew Craft in Plano, Texas, contributed to this report.", "description": "Beto O'Rourke, who has aimed to rebuild his struggling campaign on a platform of confiscating firearms, declared Sunday at a rally in Plano, Texas, that President Trump has the \"blood\" of the 22 El Paso mass shooting victims \"on his hands.\"", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
