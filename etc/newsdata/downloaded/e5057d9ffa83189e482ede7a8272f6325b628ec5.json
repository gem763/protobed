It will have five luxury bedrooms, swimming pool, bar and gym.\n\nThe Grand Tour presenter, nicknamed the Hamster, also plans to build a glazed extension to link a dining room to a display room to show off his impressive collection of fast motorbikes.\n\nNeighbours and conservation chiefs at Historic England have made no objections for the changes at the historic Bollatree Castle in the Herefordshire countryside.\n\nIn papers filed at the local council, his planning agent Mark Watson said: 'The proposal primarily involves providing additional sleeping accommodation on the first floor, with alterations to the ground floor to provide space for entertaining guests.\n\n'The swimming pool is reduced in size and the gym relocated to the southern end of the barn.\n\nThe couple have recently submitted a planning application for the property (above) to upgrade a 200-year-old ban with a bar, sleeping accommodation for five people, a gym and a new pool\n\nThe couple's barn (pictured) will be subject to a 'Grand Designs-style' makeover if approved\n\nA swimming pool (above) currently housed in the barn is set to be reduced as part of the plans\n\nIn plans submitted with the Hammonds' local council, the family has proposed turning the Grade II listed barn adjoining the house into an entertaining space for friends and family\n\n'A glazed extension provides a link between the dining area and the motorbike display room.'\n\nMr Watson said the extension is 'modest in scale' and not visible from the main house where Hammond lives with wife Mindy and their two children.\n\nThe application to Hereford Council states: 'The proposal has been designed as a minimal intervention , bringing light into the middle of the barn while being recessive to the main structure.\n\n'Internally, it is proposed to remove a section of modern floor structure to create a double height dining space with a simple detailed oak gallery providing access to the first floor.'\n\nHammond's plans also include a bigger conservatory, a new glazed kitchen and boot room, and a secondary stairway between the ground and first floors.\n\nThe couple, who bought a neighbouring property to their 15th Century castle for \u00a31.2million in 2014, last year angrily denied that they had been burgled and that thieves had ransacked it\n\nAs part of the renovations, the much-loved TV host plans to build a glazed extension to link a dining room to a display room to show off his impressive collection of fast motorbikes (above)\n\nPeople living close to the Hammonds' Cotswolds property haven't complained over a conversion to the barn (above) saying they have never been kept up by late night music there\n\nWildlife experts were called in to survey the bat population at the barn but there were not enough of the creatures to prevent the conversion going ahead.\n\nLocals have given the project the go-ahead saying they've never been disturbed by late night loud music or noise coming from the TV presenter's country pile.\n\nOne villager said: 'Apart from a few fireworks going off at New Year, we hardly hear a peep out of them.\n\nHammond, 49, is one of Britain's best known TV faces with Top Gear and The Grand Tour\n\n'He and his wife have people come and stay - you see nice cars going and going and he's not in them.\n\n'I've hardly ever seen him and he's lived here a good few years now.\n\n'He doesn't bother anyone, he's got all the privacy in the world behind the castle walls.'\n\nBollattree Castle dates back to the 15th century and was the home of a wealthy merchant. The castle walls were not added until the 18th century.\n\nThe building has gargoyles, a stable yard and stands in 20 acres of gardens which are occasionally thrown open to the public.\n\nThe outer walls of the castle are crumbling in places and the small panes of an arched widow have been smashed.\n\nBut the battlements hide a desirable manor house where Hammond has spent millions on a Grand Designs-style makeover.\n\nVillagers are proud of having a celebrity living in the village and spending a fortune on the historic folly.\n\nThe castle is protected by an overgrown moat, 12ft high hedges and an imposing wrought-iron gate with an intercom to Hammond's house.\n\nHammond's planning agent insisted the proposals were 'modest in scale' as the TV host's neighbours seemed overwhelmingly positive about the plans\n\nLocals described it as 'like Fort Knox' after reports of an attempted break-in last year.\n\nOne woman, who lives nearby and didn't want to be named, said: 'I didn't know he's made a planning application., there's been no chat about it.\n\n'Let him get on with it, that's what I say.'\n\nPlanners at Herefordshire Council are expected to make a decision later this month.\n\nHammond's proposals come just days after fellow Grand Tour presenter Jeremy Clarkson presenter sparked uproar over plans for a farm shop at his Cotswolds country estate.\n\nAnd fellow presenter James May has seen work stalled on his new \u00a33.5million pad in Hammersmith, west London, after planners turned down his plans for a car and bike collection.", "description": "The former Top Gear host and his wife Mindy have submitted plans to upgrade a barn at their property that dates back to the 15th Century - with five luxury bedrooms, a bar and a pool for friends.", "authors": ["Tom Bedford For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19697476-0-image-a-88_1571064396407.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
