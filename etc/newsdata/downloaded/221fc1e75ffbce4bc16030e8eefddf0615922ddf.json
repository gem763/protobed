The tags \u2013 which have been likened to supermarket barcodes \u2013 can be 'read' each time the container is emptied and the information uploaded into a central database.\n\nUnder a six-month trial, Denbighshire County Council in north Wales will fit microchips to food bins at around 600 properties in a bid to increase recycling rates.\n\nMicrochips on food recycling bins will be used to monitor if households are contaminating waste (stock image)\n\nEach time the orange caddies are emptied, bin crews will use chip readers to report whether they have been 'contaminated' with incorrect items.\n\nTara Dumas, the council's waste and recycling manager, said: 'The microchips will automatically provide us with data telling us who is regularly recycling.\n\n'If the caddy is contaminated we can record this and send information to the household to reinforce what we can and cannot accept.'\n\nThe aim is to increase the amount of food waste being recycled to enable the council to meet its target of 64 per cent.
