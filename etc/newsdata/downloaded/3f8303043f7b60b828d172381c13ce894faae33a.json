Add Interest\n\n\"I think the gutsiest thing I\u2019ve ever done, well, personally, [is] make the decision to stay in my marriage,\" Clinton said Tuesday on \"Good Morning America\" while promoting her new book, \"The Gutsy Book of Women,\" she wrote with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton.\n\nClinton famously saw her marriage publicly implode when then-President Bill Clinton's affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky was revealed during Bill Clinton's second term in office.\n\nAndrew Chin/Getty Images, FILE\n\nBill Clinton's initial denial of the affair ultimately led to him being impeached by the House of Representatives in December 1998. He was acquitted of perjury and obstruction of justice by the Senate two months later and served out his second term.\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP, FILE\n\nFast forward 20 years later, and President Donald Trump, the man to whom Clinton lost the 2016 election, is now facing an impeachment inquiry himself by the House of Representatives over a controversial July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nClinton said Tuesday she does not have concerns that Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are overreaching when it comes to pursuing the impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\n\"I think the evidence concerning Ukraine is so dramatic and irrefutable because it came right out of the White House, so let the impeach inquiry proceed,\" she said, referring to a transcript of the July call released by the White House. \"I know that [House Democrats] will do a thoughtful, thorough job. Nobody should jump to any conclusions.\"\n\nHillary Clinton made history as the first woman to lead the presidential ticket for a major political party in the U.S. and won the popular vote against Trump but lost the Electoral College vote.\n\n\"Publicly, politically, run for president and keep going,\" she said. \"Just get up every day and keep going.\"\n\n\"Goodness, I'm so overwhelmed by my mother's answer that I'm a bit out of words,\" said Chelsea after her mom spoke about her gutsiest moves. \"I'm just so proud to be her daughter.\"\n\nThe mother-daughter duo's new book profiling the gutsy, and often unsung, women of history stems from an ongoing conversation they have had since Chelsea was born.\n\nWalt Disney Television\n\n\"We\u2019ve been talking about women who inspire us our whole lives together,\" said Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Some of my earliest memories are my mother talking about women who inspired her, some fictional, like Nancy Drew, and some very real like Shirley Chisholm and Geraldine Ferraro,\" said Chelsea Clinton. \"So in many ways it\u2019s just a continuation of that conversation.\"\n\nOne of the women the mom and daughter feature in their book is former first lady Betty Ford, who famously went public with her breast cancer diagnosis during her husband Gerald Ford's presidency.\n\n\"When I was a young girl my mother\u2019s best friend who lived across the street got breast cancer and nobody would talk about it,\" Hillary Clinton said. \"It was not until Betty Ford courageously, with a lot of guts, not only had her mastectomy but had herself photographed in the hospital room with her husband, then-President Ford, by her side and went on to talk about it and I really believe saved so many lives.\"", "description": "Clinton and her daughter Chelsea have co-authored", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/bill-hillary-gty-jt-191001_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
