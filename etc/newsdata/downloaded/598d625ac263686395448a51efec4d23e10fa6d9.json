Some were waving Catalonia flags in solidarity with the pro-independence protests in that region of Spain.\n\nIn contrast to previous demonstrations, however, the situation quickly escalated with clashes occurring long before sunset. By late afternoon Sunday, protesters had begun tearing up bricks and throwing them at police stations along with molotov cocktails.\n\nIn mark of their increasing sophistication, protesters also produced power tools to build sturdier barricades to hold back police, drilling metal railings into the road surface itself.\n\nThe months of protests began in opposition to a now-scrapped bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, what the Hong Kong government said was in response to a brutal murder of a young Hong Kong woman by her boyfriend in Taiwan. He has since voluntarily surrendered to the Taiwanese authorities, despite the lack of extradition treaty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProtests have now swelled into an all-out rejection of Hong Kong\u2019s leaders, who many believe are only acting in Beijing\u2019s interest, and revived a demand for direct elections in the semiautonomous territory.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care whether they will approve the march or not, our fight for justice in the face of tyranny goes on anyway,\u201d said Victor, 24, who returned to his home city from New Zealand to participate in the protest. \u201cThe movement is spreading everywhere, all around the world.\u201d\n\nThe protest came days after the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), Jimmy Sham, was attacked by a group of men wielding hammers in the Mong Kok neighborhood.\n\nThe beating left Sham splayed on the street covered in blood. It was the second time in recent months that Sham, who is contesting a seat in next month\u2019s local elections, has been targeted. Sham was released from hospital on Sunday, and will continue to need medical treatment and physical therapy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe message was clear that someone or some forces behind the scenes are trying to threaten protest organizers and democracy activists,\u201d said Eric Lai vice convener of the CHRF. \u201cWe cannot identify who was behind the attacks, but the objective is to create a chilling effect on those who are making demands for justice.\u201d\n\nFounded in September 2002 in opposition to proposed national security legislation, the CHRF is an umbrella organization made up of numerous civil society groups. While the protest movement has remained leaderless and largely decentralized, the group has played a major role in organizing the largest marches.\n\nRumors spread online that the attack on Sham was carried out by people who appeared to be South Asian, prompting fears that ethnic minorities could be targeted for reprisal attacks. In response, protesters called for greater outreach to non-Chinese Hong Kongers and to remain vigilant against attempts to incite violence against them.\n\nVolunteers, minorities, protesters and other locals, stood at the gate to the Kowloon Mosque during the protest, holding signs pleading for people not to attack any ethnic minority people or buildings. While some handed out supplies others led chants and passing marchers loudly cheered them on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnly a few hours later, however, a police truck unleashed a cascade of blue water at the mosque hitting the people who had been standing outside to protect it.\n\nPassersby were left choking and vomiting, and the steps of the mosque turned blue.\n\n\u201cIt is ridiculous, the police just went mad,\u201d said Jeremy Tam, a pro-democracy lawmaker, his pants and shoes soaked blue. \u201cWe came here to protect the mosque against protesters but it was the police that did this. Why make such a scene when it was just peaceful?\u201d\n\nNawaz, a 36-year old Pakistani man who has lived in Hong Kong for a quarter century, emerged to see the blue-stained road after the cannon had sped past.\n\n\u201cI have such a bad feeling seeing this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our religion, how can they do this? Only the police is giving us pressure, not the protesters.\u201d He declined to give his family name for fear of backlash from authorities.\n\nTense scenes unfolded outside the Tsim Sha Tsui police station by early afternoon, as protesters marching past shouted chants calling the police gangsters and demanding the force be dissolved. Police use of force has emerged as a key issue for many in Hong Kong, who believe officers are acting with impunity to suppress the movement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShortly after a protester urinated on the station\u2019s gates, police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. Tear gas streamed down the Ladies Market, a popular tourist attraction, sending unprotected stall-holders and shoppers scurrying for cover, some assisted by protesters and volunteer medics.\n\nFacing the possibility of being penned in by police, many found sanctuary in little businesses that support the protests, huddled in overflowing restaurants, cafes and bars where they could change their clothes and wait for reports on Telegram indicating how they can get away safely while avoiding the police.\n\nSunday\u2019s protest, initially planned to show opposition to a recently enacted law banning the use of face masks at public gatherings continued for hours from a planned starting point in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood. April, 27, and her boyfriend William, 29, stood near a park where protesters first gathered. The two said they had held off getting married or having kids out of concern over the direction of Hong Kong and the possibility of raising children in a city where Beijing\u2019s grip is tightening.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe situation for future generations is turning worse very quickly, we are really worried,\u201d April said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t fight today there won\u2019t be a future generation.\u201d\n\nAs night fell around the Kowloon Mosque, a group of volunteers began clearing the pools of caustic blue dye, using cloths to remove it from the mosque\u2019s metal gates and brooms to sweep it into drains. Some gagged as they worked but the crowd of volunteers continued to grow by the hour.\n\nAD", "description": "The movement, now in its fifth month, continues to have widespread support and momentum despite increasing violence and police threats.", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "Ryan Kilpatrick Ho", "Timothy Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tkFGQhv0c9Uhao0QO4igDz6-zQk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LUFDRPHTFYI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
