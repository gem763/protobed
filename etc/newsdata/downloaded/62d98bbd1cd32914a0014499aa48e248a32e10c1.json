We\u2019re building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Stephen Colbert said in his monologue Thursday night. \u201cWe\u2019re building a border wall in Colorado. And once they\u2019re done with that, they\u2019re building a Naval base in Idaho.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow a lot of people, including me, mocked the president for this, haha,\u201d he continued. But The Late Show host realized his own mistake when Trump addressed the comments on Twitter late Wednesday night.\n\nTrump tweeted, \u201c(Kiddingly) We\u2019re building a Wall in Colorado\u2019 (then stated, \u2018we\u2019re not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we\u2019re building on the Border\u2019) refered to people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado & Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall!\u201d\n\nColbert played the tape for his viewers once more to see if they could detect Trump\u2019s \u201ckidding\u201d tone. \u201cThat\u2019s how you know he\u2019s kidding, \u2018cause he said \u2018it really works,\u2019\u201d he replied. \u201cYou know the old joke: Two peanuts were walking down the street and one was assaulted. Really, brutally assaulted.\u201d\n\nAs a \u201cfellow comedian,\u201d Colbert said he understood what Trump was doing. \u201cBefore you tell a joke, it\u2019s very important to kick off the joke by saying, \u2018Kiddingly.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Speaking comedian to comedian. \u201cThe Late Show\u201d host took issue with the president\u2019s latest bit.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571966799/SC_46_zcg7mt", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
