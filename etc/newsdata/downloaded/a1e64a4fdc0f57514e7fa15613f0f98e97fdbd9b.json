It really is a complete one-off,\u201d Mr. Read said.\n\n\n\nThe five-story converted warehouse is in the Sevendials area of the Covent Garden neighborhood, an enclave surrounding a junction where seven streets join at a central column adorned with six sundials.\n\n\n\nIn the 1830s, Charles Dickens wrote of Sevendials, \u201cWhere is there such another maze of streets, courts, lanes, and alleys? Where such a pure mixture of Englishmen and Irishmen, as in this complicated part of London?\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: English Soccer Star John Terry Buys \u00a34.35 Million Country Manor\n\nThe two-bedroom townhouse has beamed ceilings, wooden floors, a top-floor master bedroom, a guest bedroom, a dressing room, a living room with a balcony, a study and a dining room, according to the listing.\n\n\n\nThe property was remodeled by architect Sir Terry Farrell between 1983 and 1985. Mr. Farrell\u2019s other notable projects in the city include Camden Lock and the MI6 Headquarters at Vauxhall.\n\n\n\nThe current owner is a limited company registered in the Cayman Islands, property records show. They paid \u00a32.25 million for the property in 2009.\n\n\n\nSince Blur\u2019s heyday, Mr. James, 50, has become an award-winning cheesemaker, and holds an annual music and food festival dubbed \u201cThe Big Feastival\u201d on his 200-acre Cotswolds farm.
