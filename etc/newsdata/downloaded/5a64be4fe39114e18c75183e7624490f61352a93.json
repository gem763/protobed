When your side is top of the league with eight wins from as many games, what really do you care about the past?\n\nIt's just as well they can smile about it though because at this point 10 years ago there was nothing to raise a cheer around Anfield - and that was even before they travelled to Sunderland for one of the Premier League's most famous moments.\n\nThe Reds though headed into the 2009-10 season with a similar mindset to how they have approached this campaign. They had been Premier League runners-up the season before and were looking to go one better under popular manager Rafa Benitez.\n\nDarren Bent looks on as his strike cannons off a beach ball in a game against Liverpool\n\nThe ball took a deflection as Liverpool defenders Glen Johnson and Jamie Carragher look on\n\nAs Reina tracked the beach ball, the match ball flew past him at the Stadium of Light\n\nThat's where the similarities end. Defeats at Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea as well as a shock loss at home to Aston Villa left Benitez's side trying to cling on to a top four spot rather than challenge for the league title again.\n\nA response was needed at Steve Bruce's Sunderland and they were hoping a strong Reds support from their fans on the road could help inspire a resurgence. Instead it was their supporters that would prove their downfall.\n\nFive minutes into the game and Sunderland struck with the most bizarre goal in Premier League history. Andy Reid found a pocket of space to attack the right flank and his cross was deflected towards an unmarked Darren Bent at the back post.\n\nThe \u00a316.5million summer signing from Tottenham was in good form but he failed to connect properly with his first-time strike.\n\nThe goal gave Sunderland a 1-0 lead in the Premier League clash they went on to win\n\nReina along with team-mate Lucas Leiva angrily appeal the goal to the match assistant\n\nFortunately for him the ball which was heading straight towards Pepe Reina hit an inflated beach ball with a Liverpool crest on it, taking a wicked deflection and bamboozling the helpless Reds stopper on its way into the back of the net and a 1-0 win for the hosts.\n\nFootage soon emerged of a young Reds fans batting the ball towards the pitch from the away end at the Stadium of Light.\n\nBut on the day, Jamie Carragher admits he had little idea of the foreign intervention and could not work out why Reina was so angry with the Liverpool fans.\n\nA stunned Rafa Benitez looks on from the touchline after seeing the bizarre goal\n\nCarragher admitted he had not initially noticed the beach ball but sensed something was weird about the goal due to the reaction of this team-mates\n\n'It was just surreal,' Carragher told The Athletic. 'When Sunderland attacked, I didn\u2019t notice that there was anything on the pitch that shouldn\u2019t have been there.\n\n'When Bent scored I didn\u2019t even know that the ball had hit something. I just remember the look on Pepe\u2019s face and thinking \"what\u2019s gone on here?\" He was going mad at our fans behind the goal.\n\n'I don\u2019t remember being that angry about it because I couldn\u2019t really work out what had happened. I knew it was something weird but I didn\u2019t know quite what.'\n\nFor goalscorer Bent, he admits recalling the shock on referee Mike Jones's face at half-time when the official realised he had given a goal that should never have stood.\n\n'I didn't think anything of it,' he told Sky Sports. 'didn't think 'oh my god, look what's just happened,' I just thought 'it's a goal!' and ran off.\"\n\nBent celebrates his goal which he recalled left the referee Mike Jones panicked when he had realised too late what had happened\n\nJones's error during the game led to him being briefly demoted to the Championship\n\n'I remember the referee's face at half-time when he came to see me. He said \"did it hit the ball?\". When I said, \"Yeah\", there was panic in his face. He realised he'd made a bit of a mistake!'\n\nAs a result of his error in allowing the goal to stand, Jones was demoted to the Championship for the following weekend's matches.\n\nIt didn't get much better for the young fan whose actions put the ball onto the pitch in the first place as he received death threats in the aftermath. The ball itself though escaped the whole thing unharmed.\n\nBefore a Liverpool player could stamp his studs through the ball or Benitez put a spike into it like that elderly neighbour who never gave you your ball back as a child, it was whisked to safety and, unsurprisingly perhaps, to Manchester where it now sits in the National Football Museum.\n\nThe young Liverpool supporter who batted the ball onto the pitch received death threats", "description": "Even Liverpool fans might laugh about it now.
