I\u2019m not going to get into the details.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe said the U.S. deployment \u201cwould include some mechanized forces,\u201d but he declined to comment on reports that the Pentagon\u2019s plans include the possibility of tanks or other armored vehicles and support personnel. The purpose of the troop repositioning is to \u201censure that we can deny ISIS access to the oil fields,\u201d he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nEsper said the overall U.S. withdrawal from Syria would continue.\n\nThe troops would remain in the eastern Syrian province of Deir al-Zour, where the United States has maintained a base, Esper said. He said the U.S. military remains in close contact with the Syrian Kurdish forces that it has long assisted.\n\nAD\n\nEsper\u2019s announcement came a day after Trump said on Twitter that \u201cwe will NEVER let a reconstituted ISIS have those fields!\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region!\u201d he added.\n\nAD\n\nThe change further dilutes the practical effect of the U.S. pullout from Syria, which critics say essentially gave the Turkish invasion a green light and endangered a battlefield ally, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nPentagon officials have expressed concern that the unstable situation in Syria could allow the Islamic State to regain strength. Administration leaders have been discussing options, including tanks and associated U.S. troops, to protect oil fields that are currently under SDF control.\n\nAD\n\nThe shift to protecting oil fields also could raise issues in Congress.\n\nThe Pentagon is operating in Syria under the long-standing Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by lawmakers in the wake of terrorist attacks in September 2001 to target \u201cnations, organizations, or persons\u201d who were involved and to prevent \u201cfuture acts of international terrorism.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile the Obama and Trump administrations have argued that allows action against the Islamic State, there are concerns that the Syrian regime or forces aligned with it also could want the oil fields. In February 2018, U.S. forces said they used airstrikes and artillery to kill more than 100 advancing Syrian forces in the same area after commanders determined that U.S. troops on the ground were in danger.\n\nAD\n\nEsper was pressed repeatedly at a news conference in Brussels for more specifics about whether the plans included tanks and about how many troops would remain deployed around the oil fields, but he declined to offer more details.\n\nOne U.S. official, speaking before Esper\u2019s announcement, said an operation to secure oil fields would probably require about a company of U.S. troops at the outset, including a couple hundred service members, several tanks and supporting equipment.\n\nAD\n\nThe details would be decided based on what equipment is already in the theater, said the official, who spoke on the condition on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nAD\n\nThe announcement capped two days of discussions at NATO headquarters in Brussels that were dominated by anger at the invasion of Syria by Turkey, a fellow NATO member. One after another, defense ministers castigated Turkish officials for a move that many said risked undermining European security by destabilizing northeastern Syria. Turkish forces invaded Syria to push back U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish fighting groups that Ankara says pose a security threat to Turkey.\n\nThe Kurds played a leading role in pushing the Islamic State out of its territory in the region, and more recently they had been operating prison camps in which former Islamic State fighters and families were interned. The Turkish incursion has led to prison escapes and fears of a renewed terrorism threat to Europe.\n\nAD\n\nEsper said Friday that Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar informed him that Turkey has regained control of at least some alleged Islamic State detainees in Syria who escaped.\n\nAD\n\nA spokeswoman for the Turkish mission to NATO did not immediately respond to a call for comment.\n\nTurkey\u2019s agreement this week with Russia to jointly send in troops to the region to fill the vacuum created by the U.S. withdrawal has also caused heartburn at NATO, an alliance that spends much of its energy countering threats from the Kremlin. European countries fearful of a Russian security risk on their borders dislike that an ally, Turkey, is making security deals with Russia elsewhere in the world.\n\n\u201cThese are disagreements on a very serious situation in northeast Syria,\u201d said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who has struggled to hold together an organization that runs by consensus.\n\nNATO members have little recourse to take action against Turkey. The organization\u2019s rules do not allow members to be kicked out against their will; nor is it a venue for sanctions to be imposed. Individual members have broad power to put holds on decisions. And many NATO members still calculate that, even though Turkey can be a frustrating ally, alliance security is still improved with Turkey inside.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut many NATO policymakers fear the instability in Syria has been a gift to Russia. The upheaval in northern Syria has strengthened Russia\u2019s position in the Middle East at a time when European nations have voiced concern that a resurgent Russia could threaten their security.\n\n\u201cWe are not very enthusiastic when we see Russians on former U.S. bases,\u201d said Lithuanian Defense Minister Raimondas Karoblis. \u201cThe alliance should not give gifts to a strategic competitor.\u201d\n\nEsper meanwhile must navigate strong feelings of resentment within the Pentagon that the Trump administration has abandoned a battlefield ally and potentially provided an opening to the Islamic State, despite the president\u2019s depiction of events in Syria as a success. Trump this week said the region was safer than before, as he appeared to overlook a host of potential challenges to U.S. security including the expansion of Russia\u2019s military role in Syria and a possibility of renewed Turkish-Kurdish fighting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other side of the domestic divisions, Esper must also keep in mind the animosity Trump has articulated toward NATO and his belief that the alliance has not provided value to the United States.\n\nEsper \u201chas an audience of one,\u201d said Jim Townsend, who served as a senior Pentagon official for NATO and Europe under President Barack Obama, referring to Trump.\n\nRyan reported from Washington.
