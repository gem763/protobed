Tim Carney of the American Enterprise Institute narrates a video showing how the \u201cunseen\u201d costs of government favoritism are greater than the \u201cseen\u201d benefits.\n\nUnfortunately, stadium subsidies are just the tip of the cronyism iceberg.\n\nIn a column for the Dallas Morning News, Dean Stansel of Southern Methodist University discussed some of his research on the topic.\n\nWhile state and local economic development incentives may seem to help the local economy, the offsetting costs are usually ignored, so the overall effect is unclear. Furthermore, from the perspective of the nation as a whole, these policies are clearly a net loss. \u2026In a new research paper, my colleague, Meg Tuszynski, and I examined whether there is any relationship between economic development incentive programs and five measures of entrepreneurial activity. Like the previous literature in this area, we found virtually no evidence of a positive relationship. In fact, we found a negative relationship with patent activity, a key measure of new innovation. \u2026A recent study by the Mercatus Center found that 12 states could reduce their corporate income tax by more than 20 percent if incentive programs were eliminated. That includes a 24 percent cut in Texas\u2019 business franchise tax. In six states, it could either be completely eliminated or reduced by more than 90 percent. These are big savings that would provide substantial tax relief to all businesses, both big and small, not just those with political influence. \u2026That would provide a more level playing field in which all businesses can thrive.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a Wall Street Journal editorial from earlier the year.\n\nAmazon left New York at the altar, turning down a dowry of $3 billion in subsidies. Foxconn\u2019s promised new factory in Wisconsin, enticed with $4 billion in incentives, has fallen into doubt. \u2026Now add General Electric , which announced\u2026it will renege on its plan to build a glassy, 12-story headquarters on Boston\u2019s waterfront. \u2026The company reportedly\u2026pledged to bring 800 jobs to Boston. In exchange, the city and state offered $145 million in incentives, including tax breaks and infrastructure funds. GE\u2019s boss at the time, Jeff Immelt, said not to worry: For every public dollar spent, \u201cyou will get back one thousand fold, take my word for it.\u201d \u2026two CEOs later, a beleaguered GE won\u2019t be building that fancy tower at all. There won\u2019t even be 800 jobs. \u2026GE will lease back enough space in two existing brick buildings for 250 employees. \u2026what a failure of corporate welfare.\n\nLet\u2019s wrap this up with a look at some additional scholarly research.\n\nEconomists for the World Bank investigated government favoritism in Egypt and found that cronyism rewards politically connected companies at the expense of the overall economy.\n\nThis paper presents new evidence that cronyism reduces long-term economic growth by discouraging firms\u2019 innovation activities. \u2026The analysis finds that the probability that firms invest in products new to the firm increases from under 1 percent for politically connected firms to over 7 percent for unconnected firms. The results are robust across different innovation measures. Despite innovating less, politically connected firms are more capital intensive, as they face lower marginal cost of capital due to the generous policy privileges they receive, including exclusive access to input subsidies, public procurement contracts, favorable exchange rates, and financing from politically connected banks. \u2026The findings suggest that connected firms out-rival their competitors by lobbying for privileges instead of innovating. In the aggregate, these policy privileges reduce\u2026long-term growth potential by diverting resources away from innovation to the inefficient capital accumulation of a few large, connected firms.\n\nFor economics wonks, here\u2019s Table 2 from the study, showing how subsidies are associated with less innovation.\n\nThe World Bank also found awful results because of cronyism in Ukraine.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a problem only in developing nations.\n\nThere\u2019s some depressing research about the growing prevalence of cronyism in the United States (ethanol handouts, the Export-Import Bank, protectionism, tax favoritism, bailouts, subsidies, and green energy are just a few examples of how the friends of politicians get unearned wealth).\n\nCronyism is bad under Democrats and it\u2019s bad under Republicans.
