The Marvel Stadium show should attract over 50,000 spectators and could eclipse the UFC world record attendance of 56,214 set at the same venue in 2015\n\nWhittaker (pictured with wife Sofia) , who was born in Auckland and resides in Sydney, turned his life around to become one of the boldest names on the UFC roster. The former brick layer lived in housing commissions and struggled to pay rent before earning accolades as a professional martial artist\n\n'When I was a young adult my biggest ambition was to try and live by myself and be able to pay the rent, I come from a housing commission background,' Whittaker told the Sydney Morning Herald in February.\n\n'When I got my first car - that was it. I had made it. The next one was: let's just try and get a place of my own so I can be independent.\n\n'I've come so far from that point, I would never have believed myself.'\n\nIt's hard to fathom how Whittaker wouldn't have believed in himself. The 28-year-old is currently enjoying a nine-fight undefeated streak which dates back to 2014.\n\nWhittaker, whose bloodline is Australian-Maori-Samoan, moved to Sydney as a baby and soon threw himself into sport.\n\nHe was seven years old when he was pointed towards martial arts by his father Jack - and he's never looked back. Earning himself a black belt by age 14, the teenager then followed a path towards jujitsu and mixed martial arts.\n\n'Karate is what inspired me, what helped me get my foot in the door,' Whittaker said.\n\nJust like teenagers today, Whittaker turned to video games and honed his skills through cult classics Mortal Kombat and Tekken, The Herald Sun reported.\n\nHe was seven years old when he was pointed towards martial arts by his father Jack - and he's never looked back.

If a fight came, I definitely did have natural ability for combat. I have natural instincts and talent,' he said.\n\n'There is so much culture in the sport, history and discipline. Looking back I was always drawn to combat, even if I'm afraid of spiders, heights, but I wasn't a kid who went looking for fights.'\n\nWhittaker was last scheduled to fight in February this year but was forced to bow out amid suffering a twisted and collapsed bowel and an internal intestinal hernia.\n\nHe was slated to headline UFC 234 against U.S. challenger Kelvin Gastelum at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena when he pulled out.\n\nWhittaker's wife Sofia and manager Titus Day had to convince him to call off the fight just five minutes before he went in for surgery.\n\n'Up until five minutes before going into surgery Rob was insisting he would fight, but advice was that a blow to his stomach could be fatal,' Day said.\n\nA staph infection in his stomach forced Whittaker to pull out of UFC 221 in Perth in January 2018, which was also a title defence.\n\nWhittaker was last scheduled to fight in February this year but was forced to bow out amid suffering a twisted and collapsed bowel and an internal intestinal hernia. Whittaker's wife Sofia and manager Titus Day had to convince him to call off the fight just five minutes before he went in for surgery\n\nUFC President Dana White told TSN's Aaron Bronsteter at the time: 'He had [a] staph infection in his stomach, and from what I understand, it wasn't treated properly and started to eat away parts of his organs.'\n\n'He's in serious condition, so it's going to be a minute before he's back I think. Hopefully, it turns around quick, but that stuff is life-threatening if not treated.'\n\nWhile he was disappointed about pulling out due to the illness, there was a silvering as Whittaker was able to be there for the birth of his daughter, TVNZ reported.\n\n'I've never pulled out from a fight before, especially on home soil, and for me to have to pull out from that was pretty gut wrenching,' he said after pulling out of the fight in 2018.\n\n'But, in saying that, if I would have fought I would have missed the birth of my daughter so I'm happy with the way things worked out after all.'\n\nOut of the cage, Whittaker lives the life of a low-key family man, working out at the PMA Super Martial Arts gym and spending his downtime with wife Sofia (pictured) and their three kids\n\nWhittaker's health dropped to another low after the the staph infection as he was hit with a 'nasty' bout of chicken pox.\n\n'Getting chicken pox as an adult, I tell people and they laugh at me but it was terrible. Worst thing I've ever had,' he said.\n\nAmid the health scares, the fighter revealed how he coped with injuries and struggles with depression.\n\n'It's just something I've wanted to talk about it,' said Whittaker.\n\n'I had to come to terms with it first. I had to identify it and be able to look for it myself.\n\n'But, on the back of it, I just thought that a lot of people can take something away from my own experiences and I feel that with the platform that I have and the amount of followers and the spotlight, it's my responsibility to get that message out there.\n\n'The last couple of years have been a bit up and down, but I feel absolutely amazing. On the back of that emergency surgery that I had to undergo, I just doubled down on my health, I've really, really paying close attention on how I'm feeling, how I'm performing and just my overall health. And on the back of that I've just become stronger, bigger for it.'\n\nIn preparation for Sunday's milestone bout, Whittaker has been training in a custom-built gym out of his backyard\n\nOut of the cage, Whittaker lives the life of a low-key family man, working out at the PMA Super Martial Arts gym and spending his downtime with wife Sofia and their three kids.\n\nIn preparation for Sunday's milestone bout, Whittaker has been training in a custom-built gym out of his backyard, The Daily Telegraph reported.\n\nHe overhauled a room in the Glenmore home to install a squat rack, treadmill, bench press, wrestling mats and a variety of fight gear.\n\nThe 28-year-old says he has thrashed himself into the best shape of his career as preparation.\n\nIt will be Whittaker's first fight in his home country in almost three years and the first UFC world title defence by an Australian.\n\n'It's a milestone for my career, it's something I've always wanted to do,' Whittaker told AAP.\n\n'I'm given the moment to get out there defend my title and I'm just making history.'\n\nThe middleweight world champion, with the nickname 'The Reaper', is defending his title in the row with interim champion Nigerian-born, Auckland-based Adesanya\n\nWhittaker last fought in June 2018 in Chicago - he was scheduled to fight in Melbourne in February this year but health issues forced a rethink - so the 28-year-old has put himself through the hardest preparation of his career.\n\n'On the back of what happened last time I just jumped back into training with a fervour,' Whittaker said.\n\n'I focused on my strength, my conditioning, focused on my health, on my fitness and just honestly, I've thrashed myself this camp.\n\n'All my loads are managed with spreadsheets that my performance coach (Fabricio Itte) handles, and in terms of intensity of sessions and the work rate was just way way more.'\n\nTicket sales are on track to match, if not exceed the world record attendance of 56,214 at the previous Melbourne UFC card in November 2015.\n\nSunday's card also features a battle between two world ranked lightweights, American Al Iaquinta and New Zealand's Dan Hooker.", "description": "The Marvel Stadium show should attract over 50,000 spectators and could eclipse the UFC world record attendance of 56,214 set at the same venue in 2015.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek", "Matthew Scott For Daily Mail Australia", "Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/16/19335566-0-image-a-19_1570287937507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
