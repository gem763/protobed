In Nagano 1998 - her third and final Games - she trailed in sixth place after her short program. Gold was completely out of her reach and, due to an Achilles injury, she couldn\u2019t possibly land the jumps to earn silver or bronze.\n\nIn her free skate she made a split decision between throwing her triple lutz or doing something more spectacular. \u201cThat was my last Olympics, and pretty much my last competition ever,\u201d she told The Root in 2014.\n\n\u201cI wanted to leave a trademark.\u201d Bonaly knew she would be penalised for the move. The backflip was banned in 1976 - three years before she was born - after American Terry Kubicka landed a two-footed version at the Innsbruck Olympics.", "description": "Surya Bonaly does not like to be called a rebel - yet her reputation as the one to upset the status quo is iconic in the history of figure skating.", "authors": ["Verity Bowman", "Dame Sarah Storey", "Becky Downie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/womens-sport/2019/10/16/ss-composite-image-2019-10-16-15-2-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
