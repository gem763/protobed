Up to four players \u2013 possibly more under what Steam calls \u2018ideal conditions\u2019 \u2013 can band together and join any game that features local co-op, local multiplayer, and shared/split-screen functionality. Valve says there\u2019s an ever-expanding list of \u2018thousands of supported titles.\u2019\n\nOnly the host\u2019s system needs the game installed for others to participate. The host then invites Steam friends to link up to the session through the Remote Play feature.\n\nOn the non-host end, controllers behave as if they were connected directly to the host\u2019s computer. There\u2019s even the possibility to share keyboard and mouse control. Additionally, operating systems won\u2019t act as a barrier to play or voice chat functionality. Players can join Remote Play Together sessions regardless of whether they are running Windows, macOS, or Linux.\n\nSteam says any open Remote Play games will only show up to your Steam friends. They will only have access to the game and no other part of the host\u2019s machine to safeguard security.\n\nUnanimously Positive Reactions\n\nInitial reactions to Remote Play Together are unanimously positive. It\u2019s worth remembering it\u2019s still in beta, so it is likely to improve before launching in earnest later on.\n\nEpic Games Store Will Always Struggle To Catch Up\n\nIn comparison, the Epic Games Store struggles to implement essential features such as shopping basket and pre-loading functionality, leading to speculation that similar online local-multiplayer technology is a long way off for Epic\u2019s platform.\n\nSteam has a head start of well over a decade, and with these continuous innovations (notably, the latest library revamp), it feels like Epic Games is destined to a perpetual game of catch-up that it can never win. Exclusivity may lure users over, but consumer-friendly functionality in the ilk of Steam\u2019s latest Remote Play Together is what keeps them there.", "description": "Steam launches Remote Play Together online local multiplayer beta, striking a further blow to the Epic Store's ambitions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Steam-store-stock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
