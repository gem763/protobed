Regulators demanded the planemaker devise a patch to prevent the software from acting on erroneous data and attempting to lower a plane's angle of ascent during takeoff.\n\nThe jet remains under review by U.S. and foreign regulators.\n\nBoeing, which expects to return the 737 Max to the skies before year-end, hasn\u2019t received a single order for the aircraft this year. In July, Boeing took a $4.9 billion charge related to the aircraft\u2019s grounding.\n\nBoeing is expected to report its third-quarter results ahead of the opening bell on Oct. 23.
