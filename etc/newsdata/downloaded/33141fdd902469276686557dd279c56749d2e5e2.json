I've won three court cases against them, this is just a continuation of that fight.\"\n\nIn April, De Lille complained to the IEC about the DA's telemarketing, alleging that the script that call centre personnel used stated that she had been fired and was guilty of wrongdoing.\n\nWhen canvassers are asked about infighting and De Lille, they are allegedly asked to respond: \"We fired Patricia de Lille because she was involved in all sorts of wrongdoing in the City of Cape Town. The DA doesn't allow corruption and will take action against anyone, even our own members.\"\n\nDe Lille announced that she was leaving the DA on October 31 last year \u2013 the same day she resigned as mayor of Cape Town as per agreement with the party after months of acrimony. She later founded the Good party.\n\nThe IEC found that the DA had made a \"manifestly false statement\" by saying that De Lille had been fired, and was therefore in contravention of the electoral code.\n\nOn April 15, the IEC ordered the DA to \"cease and desist\" from saying that De Lille had been fired as mayor of Cape Town, and ordered the DA to publicly apologise to her within three days.\n\nThe DA applied to the Electoral Court to review the ruling.\n\n\n\nNews24 previously reported that Judge Robert Martin of the Western Cape High Court upheld the IEC's ruling that the DA was untruthful in its telemarketing material when it said that it had fired De Lille.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "The Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg has reserved judgment in a matter between the Electoral Commission of South Africa and the DA.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7248/a1176a261e0b4d8795d19d0431783ea2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-03"}
