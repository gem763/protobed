The Houston Astros, with one of the best rotations in the game, rode their future Hall of Fame starting pitcher as deep into the game as they could, then pieced it together from there. Each strategy had its own logic but also its own inherent dangers, especially as the game careened into extra innings.\n\nIn the end, the Astros\u2019 3-2 win wasn\u2019t so much the validation of a philosophy as the result of one night\u2019s worth of exceptional performance sprinkled with bits of good fortune \u2014 but above all, it was a massive victory for the Astros themselves, who evened the best-of-seven series at one game apiece. And it didn\u2019t take 27 outs; it took 33.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAstros shortstop Carlos Correa ended it with a majestic, no-doubt home run on the first pitch of the bottom of the 11th inning from Yankees lefty J.A. Happ, New York\u2019s ninth pitcher of the night. Correa barely budged from the batter\u2019s box at first, then casually tossed his bat, cupped his hand to the ear-hole of his helmet and strutted up the first base line as his teammates spilled out of their dugout and a crowd of 43,359 went wild.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I hit it, I knew it was going over the fence,\u201d Correa said. \u201cThe adrenaline started pumping like crazy. I don\u2019t even know what I did. \u2026 Obviously, it\u2019s a moment that\u2019s going to live with me forever.\u201d\n\nFollowing Monday\u2019s travel day, the series resumes with Game 3 at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday, with Houston ace Gerrit Cole facing Yankees right-hander Luis Severino.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBefore the game, we were saying, \u2018We have to win this game. We have to go to New York, 1-1,\u2019 \u201d said Robinson Chirinos, who caught all 11 innings and 175 pitches for the Astros. \u201cEverybody was talking about that. Thank God we split the series here at home, so we\u2019re going to go to New York and take care of business there.\u201d\n\nSunday night\u2019s game was an exquisite pitchers\u2019 duel \u2014 with offense scarce and the tension rising \u2014 just not in the traditional sense.\n\nAstros starter Justin Verlander, a longtime Yankees postseason nemesis, limited them to two runs over his 6\u2154 innings and 109 pitches, with both runs coming on Aaron Judge\u2019s homer to center in the fourth. But the Yankees, more or less by design, got only seven outs from starter James Paxton, then cycled through their five best relievers to carry the game to extra innings. Navigating the 10th required the services of converted starters CC Sabathia and Happ.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just felt like we were covered, as far as getting some length and having guys rested,\u201d Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cObviously, going into an off-day [Monday], we\u2019re going to be aggressive. \u2026 Bottom line us, we end up giving up a third run in the 11th inning. I\u2019d say from a run-prevention standpoint, we did pretty well.\u201d\n\nIn a seven-game series, it is remarkable how quickly fortunes can turn. After Saturday night\u2019s win in Game 1, the Yankees gained home-field advantage and an immeasurable psychic benefit of beating the Astros in their home park. But suddenly, after Sunday night, it is the Yankees facing an unpleasant scenario, with Cole, the most unbeatable pitcher in the game at the moment, waiting for them in Game 3 and yet another injury crisis to face.\n\nLeft fielder Giancarlo Stanton, one of a record-setting 30 Yankees players who spent time on the injured list this season, suffered a strained quadriceps muscle in Saturday night\u2019s Game 1 and was left out of their lineup Sunday night. His status is considered day-to-day, and any thought the Yankees might have of replacing him on their roster is tempered by the knowledge that doing so would also make Stanton ineligible for the World Series, should the Yankees advance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFew games in recent memory had witnessed so many rockets and lasers landing in gloves. The Astros alone hit at least six line drives directly at Yankees fielders for outs \u2014 in some cases into the teeth of a well-designed shift. Both teams hit deep flyballs that appeared headed for the seats, only to die at the warning track \u2014 part of a sustained pattern across the sport this month that has some questioning the properties of the postseason baseballs.\n\n\u201cEvery championship run, when you look back,\u201d Verlander said, \u201cthere\u2019s always moments throughout the course of a ballgame or a series [where it\u2019s], \u2018How did we win that game? What happened?\u2019 And I think tonight was nothing short of that.\u201d\n\nA 2-2 tie in the middle innings remained so through the top of the sixth only because of Correa\u2019s heads-up presence and elite arm. With runners on first and second and two outs, Brett Gardner hit a smash that one-hopped Astros second baseman Jose Altuve and caromed into shallow right-center field. As Yankees first baseman D.J. LeMahieu rounded third and headed home, waved in by third base coach Phil Nevin, Correa sprinted over, gathered it in and, from the outfield grass, fired a strike home to nail LeMahieu easily and end the inning.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVerlander pumped his fists coming off the mound, and Correa wagged his index finger \u2014 no, no, no \u2014 at no one in particular.\n\nBut Verlander\u2019s night ended three batters into the seventh. The Astros don\u2019t have the same bullpen depth as the Yankees, but high-leverage slayer Will Harris got two critical outs, and closer Roberto Osuna, brought into a tie game in the eighth, collected five.\n\n\u201cAs you start to get to the end of it, we\u2019re both counting the number of pitchers we have left and we\u2019re going to maximize those guys,\u201d Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cYou try not to run out of players. You try not to run out of pitching. But most importantly, you just try to win the game. \u2026 This was an epic game in the playoffs with everything on the line. So obviously this has only just begun. I\u2019m not drawing any conclusions. We\u2019re going the best to put our players in the best position possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Yankees, meanwhile, pulled starter Paxton after only 2\u2153 innings, at which point he had allowed only one run and four hits, and in a one-run game they launched the nightly parade of relievers for which they have become known. This postseason, they have yet to push a starter beyond 86 pitches, and only veteran right-hander Masahiro Tanaka, in Game 1, has secured an out beyond the fifth inning.\n\n\u201cI was expecting him a little bit longer,\u201d Altuve said of Paxton, \u201cbut I was happy when they took him out of the game. He was throwing 98 with nasty curve balls and cutters.\u201d\n\nFirst up Sunday night was right-hander Chad Green, who retired all six batters he faced, throwing just 26 pitches \u2014 19 below his season high \u2014 and looked like he had more left when Boone pulled him, one batter into the fifth, in favor of Adam Ottavino. In doing so, Boone may have been guilty of thinking ahead to Game 3 and/or 4, hoping to conserve Green for later duty, rather than prioritizing winning the game in front of him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the inherent risk in \u201cbullpenning\u201d is that one weak link in the chain causes the whole thing to break down. With a one-run lead, the margin for error was tiny, and with Ottavino on the mound, the lead didn\u2019t even last for one pitch. The right-hander served up a hanging slider that George Springer crushed over the Crawford Boxes in left, tying the score at 2.\n\nOttavino gave way to right-hander Tommy Kahnle for seven outs, then Kahnle to lefty Zack Britton for three. Closer Aroldis Chapman worked a scoreless ninth. That was all more or less by design. But then came the 10th, and then the 11th, and then Correa\u2019s homer was sailing into the seats, and the Yankees were staggering off the field, all that work and all that planning undone \u2014 because baseball doesn\u2019t follow anybody\u2019s blueprint.\n\nRead more on MLB:\n\nAD", "description": "The Astros and Yankees went toe-to-toe into the 11th inning before Correa\u2019s blast evened the series at one game apiece.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ariRIV7AtCZIbDAjFlO8fQirpZ8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6UHEKWHOIMI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
