We tried to alter people\u2019s perception of the music,\" adding: \"I love pushing the envelope\u2026 I love to perform for those people who think they\u2019ve seen everything before. But have you seen this? Can you get with this? That\u2019s the toughest crowd [and] I love the challenge.\"\n\nIt cemented Kanye's status as an artist from whom you can always expect the unexpected and one always seeking to push the genre boundaries placed around hip hop. Live Orchestration was also a performance that normalised rap acts performing with full-blown orchestras, with the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Migos and even Sir Mix-A-Lot following in West's footsteps since.", "description": "From Kanye West\u2019s Late Orchestration to Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Nutcrackerz", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07mfq5k.jpg"}
