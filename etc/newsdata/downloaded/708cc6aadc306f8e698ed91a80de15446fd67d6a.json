We tried to play upbeat tonight but it was hard and it didn\u2019t go all our way and we had to figure it out. We had a good debrief at halftime and came out much better.\u201d", "description": "A mix and match England team overcame a patchy start to run in four second-half tries and finish their World Cup preparations with a healthy 37-0 victory over Italy at Newcastle United\u2019s St James\u2019 Park ground on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427051744&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851YL", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
