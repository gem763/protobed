Instead, the GOP senator is a major player.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cRight,\u201d Graham responded.\n\nFourteen months later, Graham has been completely sucked into all the BS, all the theater and contradictions that come with flying in Trump\u2019s orbit. He is the president\u2019s highest-profile defender in the Senate on everything from his demands for border wall funds to his opposition to the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nGraham introduced a nonbinding resolution Thursday that would put senators on record about whether they support the process House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has launched for the impeachment inquiry. Despite his public clash with Trump over the withdrawal of troops from Syria, Graham led a group of about 10 Senate Republicans Thursday to a two-hour huddle with the president at the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Graham plans to hold hearings when the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general finishes an investigation into surveillance warrants that were used in the inquiry into Russian interference to benefit Trump\u2019s 2016 election.\n\nThat\u2019s just one of several probes the president\u2019s allies have been pushing Graham to launch. They have urged him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. Some have even pushed for Graham to try to force Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the leader of the impeachment probe, to testify before his panel.\n\nHe has come a long way from August 2018 when he reflected, three days after McCain died, on his final conversations with the 2008 GOP presidential nominee and the bitter fights McCain had with Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGraham had told reporters he would take that advice in dealing with Trump. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to help him where I can, and not get sucked into all the other drama,\u201d Graham said that day.\n\nBy that point, Graham had already begun his journey into Trump\u2019s inner circle after initially serving as his highest-profile critic during the 2016 campaign (at a time when McCain said he would support Trump).\n\nAbout two years ago, Graham started talking to some of Trump\u2019s national security team, and the initial phase of becoming a presidential ally seemed to focus on trying to steer Trump\u2019s isolationist instincts closer to the traditionally hawkish Republican positions favored by McCain.\n\nAD\n\nGraham still introduced legislation designed to shield Robert S. Mueller III, the former special counsel who spent two years investigating the president, from getting fired.\n\nAD\n\nGraham\u2019s rip-roaring defense of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation last year made him a conservative hero, a status he last held 20 years ago when he served as a House impeachment manager in the Senate trial of President Clinton. Once he arrived in the Senate in 2003, he drifted into McCain\u2019s orbit and became a target for a conservative primary challenge every six years.\n\nBy Thursday, however, Graham was fully in the Trump corner. And the reward for that loyalty is almost unlimited access to power.\n\nAD\n\nIn just about six hours of whirlwind action, Graham bounced from the Russell Senate Office Building to the Capitol, met up with a bunch of Republicans, went to the White House, hustled back to make some afternoon votes and then held a 30-minute news conference denouncing Pelosi and Schiff.\n\nAD\n\nIn between each task, he held court in at least a half-dozen scrums with the media, all but one of which involved the senator roaming freely in the Capitol without an aide monitoring what he said or guiding him to his next appointment.\n\nIn the White House Situation Room, the GOP senators spent a little more than an hour with top military leaders laying out an emerging plan for trying to leave some troops in Syria.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGreat conversation about Syria and the complexities of it,\u201d Graham told reporters back in the Capitol. \u201cI learned a lot about the president\u2019s thinking I quite frankly didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s odd, as much as we talk.\u201d\n\nGraham uses Trump\u2019s infatuation with Syrian oil fields to try to nudge him to leave enough troops to help the United States\u2019 Kurdish allies, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, fight Islamic State forces.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou know, the oil is a key asset,\u201d Trump told Graham.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s keep talking here,\u201d Graham replied, according to his account. \u201cIf the money goes to the right people, the SDF, that\u2019s a good thing. And it keeps the ISIS fight going. Mr. President, the oil field won\u2019t guard itself.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGraham seemed to acknowledge that he is not sure Trump will sign off on the plan. \u201cI see a plan in place that could work. Whether or not it\u2019s approved, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he told reporters after the meeting.\n\nThe price Graham, and the other nine senators, had to pay is listening to Trump repeat himself, about the Russia investigation and now the impeachment inquiry about his effort to push Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings there.\n\nAfter the Syria briefing, the group grabbed lunch together, with beef as the main entree and a large serving of impeachment grievances.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe bulk of the lunch \u2014 40, 45 minutes \u2014 was the president saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u2019 \u201d Graham explained.\n\nAD\n\nAll this help still hasn\u2019t won total loyalty with Trump and his closest allies. They have been complaining that Graham, who is up for reelection next year, will not open investigations designed to help Trump.\n\nThe president lashed out during a news conference two weeks ago. \u201cLindsey should focus on Judiciary,\u201d Trump said, suggesting several investigations that would help him.\n\nGraham told reporters he would not \u201cturn the Senate into a circus.\u201d He later said that he also had a quick huddle with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, a friend of Graham\u2019s from his days as a South Carolina congressman.\n\nHe told Mulvaney to staff up a better messaging operation to defend Trump.\n\nDid Mulvaney ask Graham to do anything more?\n\n\u201cNo, I think I\u2019m doing my part,\u201d Graham said.\n\nHe\u2019s no longer worried about getting sucked into the drama.\n\nAD", "description": "The South Carolina lawmaker has become the president\u2019s highest-profile defender on everything from border wall funds to opposing the House impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HOcrqkwEUadQFpBVFHF4abaRnF8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O3AZ43HWUMI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
