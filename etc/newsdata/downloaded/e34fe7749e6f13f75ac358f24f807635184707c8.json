Trevillian was killed in a single-vehicle crash on Saturday, just hours after her wedding ceremony. (Photo: Bennett & Barden Funeral Home)\n\nJust hours after her wedding ceremony, a bride was killed in a single-vehicle crash in Powhatan, Virginia. Now, her family, friends, and the community are struggling to make sense of the tragedy.\n\nOn Saturday, nurse Danielle L. Trevillian, 29, had left her wedding reception in a 2013 Ford F 150 to go pick up suitcases when she ran off Rocky Ford Road, a curvy road some locals describe as \"treacherous.\"\n\n\"As [she] was coming out of the curve, she ran off-road right, striking a tree, and veered left back onto the roadway,\" a Virginia State Police spokesperson said, according to WTVR. \"Trevillian then went off-road left, striking several trees, and overturned.\"\n\nInvestigators report that Trevillian was not wearing her seat belt and was partially ejected from the truck. She died at the scene of the crash.\n\nAccording to the nurse's obituary, she is survived by her husband, Joshua Trevillian; her daughter, Kinslee; her parents; two sisters; her best friend; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nThe fatal accident has left her family and the community in disbelief.\n\n\"It was really a tragic accident that happened and it's something I think a lot of us are still trying to grasp,\" said Candice Gentry, a former coworker of Trevillian's when she worked at the Bridge Church of God daycare. \"Because it's very tragic, when it happened\u2026 right after a wedding... it's just terrible.\"\n\nWhen Gentry learned Trevillian was engaged, she reached out and learned \u201chow unbelievably happy she was and how happy [Joshua] made her. I was so happy for her.\"\n\nOthers in the community shared their condolences on Powhatan Today Newspaper's Facebook post.\n\n\"Danielle was an incredible mother, awesome friend, and volunteered her free time in the elementary school,\" one person shared. \"She worked countless [PTA] events and gave everything that she had to her community and her family. She is definitely in heaven watching her sweet daughter and family. I was devastated at the news of her passing. Powhatan is a less happy place without her in it.\"\n\nAnother shared: \"She had just gotten married that afternoon \u2014 what a terrible tragedy. My heart just aches for this sweet family.\"\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" another friend of the family wrote. \"I just spoke with her Thursday evening at Walmart. She was so excited. My thoughts and prayers are with her and her family.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Just hours after her wedding ceremony, a bride was killed in a single-vehicle car crash in Powhatan, Virginia.
