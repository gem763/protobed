No, nothing serious.\u201d\n\nKlopp was full of praise for his players after they recovered from conceding a first-minute goal to Harry Kane, moving joint third alongside Martin Chivers on the club\u2019s all-time list after his 178th goal for the club.\n\nAfter goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga had kept Liverpool at bay with a string of saves in the first half, Reds captain Jordan Henderson equalised with his first Anfield goal since December 2015 before Salah struck from the spot after Sadio Mane was fouled by Serge Aurier.\n\nLiverpool have won six and drawn three of the last 10 league matches at home when they have conceded the first goal, while the win extended their unbeaten league record at Anfield to 45 matches dating back to April 2017.\n\nIt restored their six-point lead over Manchester City at the top of the table with a ninth win in 10 unbeaten matches.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely pleased, but to be honest, I expect it as well,\u201d added Klopp.\n\n\u201cAn early goal is obviously not the best thing that can happen, but sometimes it makes one thing clear: game on.\n\n\u201cThe counter-press was exceptional, it was kind of back. I loved that, that was really good.\n\n\u201cI told the boys at half-time; \u2018The only problem in this game so far is the result \u2013 apart from that, it\u2019s good\u2019.\u201d\n\nBy contrast Tottenham have now lost 11 of the last 22 league games and have not kept a clean sheet away from home since winning 3-0 at Cardiff on New Year\u2019s Day, their last league victory outside of London.\n\n\u201cDifferent phases during the game I think we played well. When we score so early, the team try to defend and we miss a little bit to play,\u201d said Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino.\n\n\u201cIn the first half it was difficult to connect the play and go forward and dominate. When we scored so early it is like we need to defend, defend, defend.\n\n\u201cWe need to improve a lot but of course we\u2019re a little bit disappointed. The team is really competitive.\n\n\u201cIn this season I think we deserve more points but we didn\u2019t get them so it is the moment to stay strong and keep pushing.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0manager Jurgen Klopp played down fears Mohamed Salah had sustained another ankle problem after the Egypt international was substituted in Sunday\u2019s 2-1 Premier League win over Tottenham.", "authors": ["Carl Markham"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/27/20/mo-salah.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
