Each degree would be broken into 12 lots of six-week intensive courses, each one requiring 25 hours of study a week.\n\nStudents could start their study with any one of the intensive courses. Someone could potentially start their study on October 28, which is just two weeks before most academics stop teaching for the year.\n\nWith the first course starting in mid-January, online students would be at work six weeks before before the campus-based academic year gets underway.\n\n'More flexibility'\n\nProfessor Levy rejected a suggestion this meant the university was skirting the National Tertiary Education Union.\n\n\"This is about being able to offer more flexibility to our students. The NTEU was kept fully updated on the development of these programs and was comfortable about it.\"\n\n\"Our academic staff asked if we were moving online how that would affect our pattern of work under the enterprise agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are not asking them to work at midnight because the online courses are always open. But we have a cohort of tutors which will be available outside usual work hours.\"\n\nShe said tutors would work with the university's course co-ordinators, just as they would if they were on staff.\n\nManaging director of Pearson Asia Pacific, David Barnett, said his company had begun life as a publisher but expanding into teaching was a natural extension of supporting institutions to develop knowledge.\n\n\"We provide a strategy, marketing and tutors. There is never any face to face contact. Adelaide is reaching outside traditional areas.\"", "description": "The university's online courses will start in mid-January and run into December.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3217%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_231%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/918bc16992ed6845048d56fdc8a44caf2971cd91", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
