And is it legal?\n\nIn the Know investigates the new CBD trend, and what scientists think of it, in the video above.\n\nCBD, which is different from THC, is a chemical compound found in cannabis plants. While there have been extensive studies conducted on how THC interacts with the human body, research into what happens when someone ingests CBD is inconclusive \u2014 which makes its legal status a gray area in most states.\n\nWhat scientists can confidently conclude is that CBD attaches to receptors in the body that influence anxiety and pain, and most people do report feeling better after taking CBD.\n\nBut, again, the hard medical evidence supporting what CBD can do is not concrete.\n\nThe lack of science behind CBD makes deeming it a legal substance a little tricky. Three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Nebraska \u2014 have challenged legalizing CBD, even for medical purposes, because of how little information there is.\n\nDespite the ambiguity, people swear by CBD's properties. If you are worried about the effects and whether its legal in your area, In the Know recommends consulting your doctor first.\n\nWatch the video above to learn more about CBD.", "description": "Culture has dubbed CBD oil a miracle \u2014 you can now find it in lattes, food and creams \u2014 but is it effective?
