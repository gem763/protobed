Wijnaldum, who likes to tease people, waited until everyone was there, came up to me and asked out loud \u2018Mo Salah, why did Mane want to hit you?\u2019 and the whole team started laughing.\" \ud83d\ude02\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/wtbJLvi3yd \u2014 Anfield Watch (@AnfieldWatch) October 16, 2019\n\nMane told Canal Plus: 'He said to me \"Sadio, why are you angry?\" I told him, \"You needed to give me the ball, Mo\", to which he replied, \"I didn't see you. You know I've got nothing against you\".\n\n'I know that, but his reaction was a bit strange to me. We talk on the phone sometimes, we text each other and we don't have a problem.\n\n'We talked between ourselves, and then the manager called me into his office and we spoke. I told him it was already sorted and he was pleasantly surprised.'\n\nMane remonstrates with Salah after he failed to pass to him in the match against Burnley, which sparked the Senegalese forward's angry reaction when he was substituted\n\nAlthough the pair have both publicly denied that their spat is ongoing, the statistics don't look particularly favourable when it comes to their partnership.\n\nAs the Reds pair battle it out for the Golden Boot, it has emerged that Salah hasn't created a single chance for Mane in their matches together so far this season.\n\nLiverpool currently have a 100 per cent win record in the league, but Klopp will be desperate to make sure that there is no bad blood bubbling under the surface between two of the club's most important players.\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE - MO SALAH TO SADIO MANE Season Mins Played Together Passes Assists Chances Created 2017-18 1896 54 1 8 2018-19 2996 112 3 17 2019-20 598 12 0 0\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE - SADIO MANE TO MO SALAH Season Mins Played Together Passes Assists Chances Created 2017-18 1896 67 6 20 2018-19 2996 105 1 20 2019-20 598 14 0 4", "description": "Sadio Mane has lifted the lid on his furious bust-up with Mohamed Salah, admitting that the Liverpool pair confronted each other in the changing rooms after their incident at Burnley in August.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/09/19826304-0-image-a-2_1571300055909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
