By taking a stand and being open about its choices, rather than affecting neutrality", "language": "en", "text": "Recently, Twitter was summoned to explain itself to a parliamentary committee because some right-wing handles felt they were being downvoted and rendered less visible. This has been an outcry among US Republicans too, who accuse the platform of \u201cshadow banning\u201d, muting a person\u2019s content without their awareness.\n\nTwitter says that its algorithm is only responding to behaviour signals \u2013 like how often an account is reported, blocked, muted, liked and so on. So, it\u2019s simply that spreading too much negativity has backfired on some high-profile handles.\n\nMeanwhile, those who spoke out against the targeting of Kashmiri citizens, in the aftermath of the Pulwama terrorist attack, have been subjected to intense, concerted abuse. Journalists like Barkha Dutt have been sent detailed death threats and explicit pictures.\n\nWhen a swarm descends on one person, the effects can feel catastrophic and crazy-making. But Twitter had been reluctant to react to this organised assault \u2013 instead, its main grouse was Dutt sharing a picture of male genitals that was sent to her as abuse.\n\nSo what is the platform expected to do? Everyone resents Twitter, everyone expects better of it. This is what happens when a little microblogging site, which began with no bigger aim than chirping about your day to your friends, ends up becoming the pulse of humanity, the global public sphere itself.\n\nIt\u2019s now crucial to politics, for ideological warfare, for politicians to brand themselves and create a direct, emotional bond with their voters. It shapes the news. It has linked and boosted protest movements and counter publics, it has pockets and folds of brilliance. It is also a partisan echo-chamber, a fount of fake news, and a place where women and minorities pay a high price for being vocal and visible. It is time for Twitter to decide whether free speech means unfettered, anything-goes speech, or speech that allows everyone to converse without fear.\n\nRemember that only five years ago, we were still talking of Web 2.0 as a participatory utopia. We celebrated our new networked possibilities, the destruction of intermediaries, exulted that anyone could organise revolutions \u201cat the click of a mouse\u201d. Silicon Valley companies cast themselves as innocent platforms for free speech, as neutral as post offices. Any government that wanted to regulate them was seen as meddling with our freedom and our technological destiny.\n\nAnd then the epistemic crisis revealed itself \u2013 slowly, it sunk in that social media had helped create a post-truth chaos, the cracking of reality into separate partisan worlds. Free speech, it turned out, was also cover for a lot of disinformation, propaganda, zombie armies of bots \u2013 a tidal wave that could destabilise politics, maybe even turn elections. Social media companies could not escape responsibility; the hands-off technocratic pose was no longer tenable.\n\nPlatforms are not blank slates or open stages, things don\u2019t go spontaneously viral, platforms actively organise what is seen and hidden. They are \u201cintricate, algorithmically managed visibility machines\u201d, writes Tarleton Gillespie, Cornell professor and tech scholar, in his book Custodians of the Internet, about the hidden decisions that shape social media. He argues that content moderation is not a side activity, it is the fundamental thing that platforms do.\n\nThey have three ways of doing this: editorial review, community flagging and machine detection. Editorial review is done by human judges, a few employees at the company and a large number of outsourced crowd workers. Community flagging is when we, the users, point attention to problematic content, and it gains from our specialised, grounded expertise and capacities, but it is subject to our vagaries. Machine detection, though image or word filters, is still being refined.\n\nAll of these are easier said than done \u2013 whether it is blocking terrorist material or graphic violence or abuse, it\u2019s one thing to state the principle, and another to draw the actual lines, which are often ad hoc, informed by past experience or future trouble. So instead of hiding behind mysterious algorithms, social media platforms would do better to define their values, and what sort of public conversation they want to foster.\n\nPlatforms curate and shape what we see. For instance, Twitter chooses not to insist on real names, which protects political dissidents, but also facilitates trolling. It sets rules that determine what can trend. Often, platforms play with light and shadows: problematic posts are hidden in certain geographies and visible in others. This may seem like good strategy, but it also leaves them open to the charge of opacity and duplicity.\n\nPerhaps, as Gillespie says, the solution lies in more open editorial responsibility and not less. Rather than saying it\u2019s just the algorithms, platforms should be more open about what human and institutional choices dictate the algorithms. Don\u2019t try to be all things to all people, make principled judgments, and then reveal those judgments.\n\nRight now, these platforms are sticky \u2013 to leave is to sacrifice one\u2019s public presence, so even those who complain bitterly about Twitter are stuck with raging on it. This situation is not permanent. But Twitter needs to make its priorities clear now \u2013 will it stand up against the systematic abuse of those who defended fellow citizens, or will it be intimidated by those fouling the discourse? It\u2019s a stark enough choice.", "description": "Recently, Twitter was summoned to explain itself to a parliamentary committee because some right-wing handles felt they were being downvoted and rendered less visible.
