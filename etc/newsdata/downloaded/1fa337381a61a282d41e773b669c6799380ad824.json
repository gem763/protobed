But she was also running out of legal options, and had painted herself into a corner.\n\nThe question of whether the House can begin an impeachment inquiry into the president without a formal vote to authorize one is complicated. Judge Beryl Howell, who presided over the grand jury impaneled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, ruled last Friday that the House Judiciary Committee could gain access to normally-secret grand jury testimony partly because Pelosi had declared the House was officially launching an impeachment inquiry.\n\nNormally, such testimony would not be made available, except as part of a judicial proceeding. Judge Howell held that an impeachment inquiry was a judicial proceeding \u2014 and held, further, that there was no need for the House to hold a formal vote to launch one. Though it had done so in prior impeachments involving a president, it had often begun its investigations before such votes, and it had not held similar authorization votes in impeaching judges.\n\nThe Department of Justice appealed Howell\u2019s ruling on Monday. One of its arguments in doing so was that the House Judiciary Committee no longer needed Mueller\u2019s evidence, because Pelosi had \u201cannounced that the House impeachment inquiry will focus narrowly on the whistleblower complaint and issues surrounding Ukraine.\u201d Moreover, that inquiry is being led by the House Intelligence Committee, not the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nAs Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe \u2014 who has demanded Trump\u2019s impeachment since before the president took office \u2014 noted in June, it was a \u201cgamble\u201d to ask the courts to compel the release of Mueller\u2019s grand jury testimony. The only way to guarantee that the grand jury testimony would be released to the House would be to hold a vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry.\n\nNo doubt Pelosi\u2019s vote will cite the Mueller and Ukraine cases. Thus the president will face an impeachment inquiry that alleges he obstructed justice to cover up his imagined collusion with Russia \u2014 while also colluding with Russia\u2019s enemy, Ukraine, to smear a likely political opponent.\n\nBoth charges are absurd. But Democrats never had a chance of booting Trump from office. The fact that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) had 50 Republicans co-sponsor a resolution opposing the House procedures confirms that.\n\nWhat Pelosi and her party want most, evidently, is to produce as much dirt on Trump as possible. That is why they leaked bits of testimony from what they claimed, at the same time, was a \u201cgrand jury\u201d proceeding (where leaks are forbidden).\n\nThe Ukraine well ran dry the moment the White House released the transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president. The Mueller grand jury testimony became important again: it was back to Square One.\n\nBut Pelosi had boxed herself into a corner. Mueller found no collusion, so the only faint hope for impeachment was Ukraine. But Democrats had told the courts Mueller was the reason they needed the grand jury testimony. They won with Howell, a judge appointed by President Barack Obama; their chances looked slimmer going forward.\n\nSo Pelosi had no legal options but to hold a vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry. Eventually, politics ran into the law.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
