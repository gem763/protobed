(AP) - The defensive shutdown complete, Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey shared a hug and private words with A.J. Bouye, D.J. Hayden and a few other members of a Jacksonville defense that won the day in a 20-7 victory Thursday night over the Tennessee Titans.\n\nHugs of celebration or hugs of farewell?\n\nRamsey wasn\u2019t saying.\n\nNo one else was sure.\n\nIn his first game since demanding a trade, the Jaguars\u2019 troubled but talented shutdown cornerback made it look as though it was business as usual. Ramsey heard a smattering of cheers when he jogged onto the field an hour before kickoff - right before it started raining - and his share of boos during the game.\n\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Bouye said. \u201cHe told us he\u2019s out there rocking with us. We knew it was going to be a different type of energy in the stadium with the fans, but he was able to maintain focus and stay with us. He could have checked out plenty of times, but he never did.\n\n\u201cHe went out and did what he does and just competed.\u201d\n\nThe Jaguars (1-2) now have 10 days to figure out the next step before they play at Denver.\n\nRamsey, chatting away at receivers on the field as usual, was on silent mode when it came to talk about wanting out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to answer any questions about the trade or anything,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if it felt like a normal game, he said this was in prime time and everything was \u201ca little bit more amped up.\u201d Ramsey was most animated talking about the defensive front that recorded nine sacks and brought back chants of \u201cSacksonville\u201d from the Jaguars\u2019 run to the AFC title game two years ago.\n\n\u201cHe gives us a better chance,\u201d said Calais Campbell, who recorded three sacks.\n\nRamsey was far more clear about wanting a trade in an appearance on the Uninterrupted \u201c17 Weeks\u201d podcast with Nate Burleson, which came out hours before the game. Ramsey said the trade request stemmed from \u201csome disrespectful things said on their end\u201d in a meeting after the Jaguars\u2019 loss Sunday at Houston.\n\nThe shouting match with coach Doug Marrone? Ramsey wrote that off to passion and emotion, which happens all over the league.\n\nHe held his ground on wanting out of Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cRequesting the trade \u2026 it\u2019s kind of been building over time,\u201d Ramsey said on the podcast, which was taped Monday. \u201cIt has nothing to do with my teammates here. It has nothing to do with the city. \u2026 But it\u2019s more so with the front office and the organization.\u201d\n\nRamsey said Tuesday neither he nor his agent had anything to do with his trade request becoming public. He said he didn\u2019t want to be a distraction, but it was all the talk going into the Jaguars\u2019 game Thursday night.\n\n\u201cYou got people booing him,\u201d Bouye said. \u201cI\u2019s a little weird hearing them boo Jalen. But he used it as fire.\u201d\n\nJags owner Shad Khan told the NFL Network, \u201cThis is a team sport, and I think I am very sensitive to individual needs. But we have to do the right thing for the team.\u201d\n\nRamsey delivered a strong performance in the loss to the Texans, holding DeAndre Hopkins to four catches for 27 yards when he covered him. He also dropped an interception right in his gut that looked certain to go for a touchdown.\n\nBut the moment that stands out was when Marrone didn\u2019t challenge Hopkins\u2019 first-down catch late in the first quarter. Ramsey yelled at Marrone as he walked off the field. Marrone responded by getting in Ramsey\u2019s face and screaming.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think much of that in particular because that happens from time to time,\u201d Ramsey said on the podcast. \u201cThat\u2019s just passion and emotion. I felt like that got blew up more than it should have. \u2026 It was just the moment, it was just the incident.\u201d\n\nHe said he had moved beyond that until after the game. Ramsey described the locker room atmosphere as tough. He didn\u2019t say who met with him from the Jaguars, only that he didn\u2019t like what was said.\n\n\u201cSome disrespectful things were said on their end that made me definitely walk out and call my agent as soon as I walked out,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s time. My time is up here in Jacksonville.\u2019 I said I want to ask for a trade. I was truly at peace, like I wasn\u2019t in a mindset of making a decision while I was angry. I was completely calm. I still stand by that decision, asked for a trade.\u201d\n\nBouye said their embrace after the game was special, even if he wasn\u2019t sure where it would lead.\n\n\u201cHe just said, \u2018We\u2019ll see what happens. Let\u2019s keep rocking until then,\u2019\u201d Bouye said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long weekend seeing what happens.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The defensive shutdown complete, Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey shared a hug and private words with A.J.
