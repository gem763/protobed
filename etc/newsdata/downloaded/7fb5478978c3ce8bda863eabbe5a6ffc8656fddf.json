Who wants to go digging through all their financial records to provide to a new financial institution?\" he said.\n\nMr Frydenberg last week directed the consumer watchdog to investigate banks not passing on in full Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate cuts, difference in rates charged to new and existing customers and barriers to switching lenders.\n\nAfter his calls for the banks to pass on rate cuts in full were ignored for a third time this year, Mr Frydenberg tasked the ACCC with looking into the pricing of residential mortgage products, and to examine obstacles that stop customers switching lenders.\n\nMr Sims on Thursday also flagged plans for a rolling \"series\" of probes into the market power of the big banks and technology platforms, including a potential inquiry to help small banks compete better against the big four lenders.\n\n'We'd do one, then another'\n\nAsked by Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos if a future inquiry would look at small banks competing against big lenders, Mr Sims agreed it was a fertile area to examine for his financial services unit to consider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We were set up to do a series of inquiries into ways to make the financial sector more competitive,\" Mr Sims said.\n\n\"We'd do one, then another one and there'd be another one.\"\n\nSmaller banks are lobbying the government to narrow mortgage risk weight differences between the major banks and the regional banks, which makes it cheaper for the majors to fund their home loans.\n\nThe Turnbull government accepted former banker David Murray\u2019s recommendation to make application of capital requirements neutrally competitive, but the change is yet to happen.\n\nA special ACCC financial services unit was set up in May 2017.\n\nIt has already conducted an investigation into the foreign exchange fees charged by banks and probed the effect of banks' use of prudential regulation restricting interest-only loans, which it concluded was used as a cover to lift profits by $1.1 billion.\n\nMr Sims said the ACCC wanted more funding to set up a permanent digital platforms unit, after its recent digital platforms inquiry handed to the government.\n\n\"We've got 23 recommendations that can deal with issues that are there now, but we think there needs to be continuing monitoring and focus on these sorts of economic issues,\" he said.", "description": "The competition watchdog's mortgage pricing investigation will extend beyond home loans to include bank \"bundling\" other financial products, such as credit cards, which makes it harder to switch lenders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2238%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f5b57bee7c31de177d562ec1a49417a4fad33fdd", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
