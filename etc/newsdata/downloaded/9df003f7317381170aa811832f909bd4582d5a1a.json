Now, Google says it\u2019s adding a new USB-C key to the lineup, which will be available tomorrow from the Google Store for $40.\n\nThe USB-C key appears to have similar functionality to Google\u2019s USB-A key and Bluetooth keys, all of which are built to the FIDO standard. A spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that the USB-C model lacks the NFC capabilities that its other two keys have. This may not be too much of a loss, though, as you\u2019ll more easily be able to plug the USB-C key directly into recent phones and computers without using an awkward USB adapter or having to rely on Bluetooth.\n\nGoogle\u2019s new USB-C key is compatible with Android, Chrome OS, macOS, and Windows devices, according to the company. (Only the Bluetooth key works with iOS, and it requires the installation of Google\u2019s Smart Lock app.) Like its previous keys, Google says the USB-C key\u2019s firmware is permanently sealed into a secure element hardware chip, making the key more resistant to physical attacks.\n\nGoogle partnered with Yubico on the new key\n\nGoogle says it partnered with security key-maker Yubico to manufacture its new USB-C key, and it shows: Google\u2019s key looks a lot like Yubico\u2019s YubiKey 5C. Both keys are pretty similar, but Yubico\u2019s keys support a few more protocols than Google\u2019s Titan keys do, such as WebAuthn, so they might be the better option for some, depending on what you need.\n\nGoogle\u2019s other two Titan security keys were previously only available as a $50 bundle, but Google says you\u2019ll be able to buy them individually starting tomorrow. The USB-A / NFC key will cost $25, while the Bluetooth key, which can also be plugged in over Micro USB, will cost $35.", "description": "Last August, Google released its first two Titan security keys, which you could use as physical keys for two-factor authentication for some online services over USB-A, NFC, or Bluetooth.
