Mandatory Credit: Matt Kartozian-USA TODAY Sports - 13214688\n\nBurfict will miss the remainder of the 2019 season \u2014 including any playoff games if the Raiders reach the postseason \u2014 as a result of repeated violations of unnecessary roughness rules.\n\nBurfict\u2019s appeal was heard Tuesday, nine days after he was ejected for lowering his helmet to initiate contact on Colts tight end Jack Doyle. Multiple outlets reported Friday that the league had identified an additional illegal hit in the same game, strengthening the case against Burfict in the appeal hearing.\n\nThe eighth-year pro will forfeit nearly $1.2 million \u2014 $879,412 in base salary and $284,375 in per-game roster bonuses \u2014 during the suspension. His one-year deal with the Raiders expires after this season, making him a free agent next March.\n\nThe season-ending punishment was originally handed down by NFL vice president of football operations Jon Runyan, who wrote that Burfict\u2019s history of violent conduct was a major factor in the severity.\n\n\u201cFollowing each of your previous rules violations, you were warned by me and each of the jointly appointed appeal officers that future violations would result in escalated accountability measures,\u201d Runyan wrote, in part. \u201cHowever, you have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from the unnecessary risk.\u201d\n\nBurfict, 29, missed the opening of both the 2016 and 2017 seasons while serving suspensions for player-safety violations, and he was out again at the start of 2018 for a violation of the league\u2019s policy on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nIn 2016, Burfict had a five-game suspension for a hit on Kansas City Chiefs fullback Anthony Sherman reduced by appeals officer James Thrash to three games.\n\nBurfict amassed more than $4 million in on-field conduct fines during a turbulent seven-year stretch with the Cincinnati Bengals from 2012-18.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "NFL appeals officer Derrick Brooks upheld Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict's season-ending suspension on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1439014166&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9824R-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
