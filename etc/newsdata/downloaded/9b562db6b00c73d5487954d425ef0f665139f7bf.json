And nowhere was the news bigger than in Chicago.\n\nSep 29, 2019; Chicago, IL, USA; Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky (10) walks off the field at the end of the game with his arm in a sling after being injured against the Minnesota Vikings at Soldier Field. Mandatory Credit: David Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Bears have officially ruled starter Mitchell Trubisky out for Sunday\u2019s game against the Chicago Bears in London as he deals with a dislocated left shoulder and slight labrum tear sustained in last weekend\u2019s 16-6 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. Chase Daniel will start in his place.\n\n\u2014In Buffalo, quarterback Josh Allen remains in the NFL concussion protocol, but the club has labeled him as questionable for Sunday\u2019s game against the Tennessee Titans. He still needs to be cleared by an independent neurologist over the weekend before he can be cleared to play, though he was a full practice participant on Friday. He was injured in the third quarter in last Sunday\u2019s loss to New England after absorbing a helmet-to-helmet hit. Matt Barkley will start should Allen not be able to go.\n\n\u2014The New York Jets announced starter Sam Darnold will not play at Philadelphia this weekend, making it the third game he will miss after being diagnosed with mononucleosis on Sept. 12. Luke Falk will be the Jets\u2019 starting quarterback for the second consecutive game, after going 12 of 22 passing for 98 yards and an interception in a 30-14 loss to the New England Patriots two weeks ago in his first career start.\n\n\u2014With starting quarterback Case Keenum nursing a foot injury, Washington coach Jay Gruden announced that Colt McCoy will start against the Patriots over rookie first-round pick Dwayne Haskins. McCoy will be making his season debut after working his way back from multiple surgeries to repair a fractured right fibula suffered last December. Haskins, the 15th overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft, threw three interceptions in relief of Keenum in Washington\u2019s 24-3 loss to the New York Giants last Sunday.\n\nMore players ruled out\n\n\u2014Los Angeles Rams linebacker Clay Matthews will need surgery to repair a broken jaw and will miss four-to-six weeks, coach Sean McVay announced. McVay said he believes the injury occurred when Seattle running back Chris Carson inadvertently kicked Matthews in the face during the Rams\u2019 30-29 loss to the Seahawks on Thursday.\n\n\u2014Indianapolis Colts outside linebacker Darius Leonard will miss his third straight game because of a concussion, as coach Frank Reich said Leonard won\u2019t be able to pass the protocol prior to Sunday\u2019s game against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n\u2014Green Bay wide receiver Davante Adams is out for Sunday\u2019s road game against the Dallas Cowboys. Adams did not practice this week after sustaining a toe injury in the Packers\u2019 34-27 loss to Philadelphia on Sept. 26. The Packers also ruled out running back Jamaal Williams (concussion) and cornerback Tony Brown (hamstring).\n\n\u2014Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill will miss a fourth consecutive game with a clavicle injury suffered in Week 1, but is practicing with the team and is believed to be nearing a return.\n\n\u2014Giants running back Saquon Barkley is officially out for Sunday\u2019s game against visiting Minnesota, though he continues to make progress from a high ankle sprain suffered Sept. 22. He will aim to return for next Thursday\u2019s game in New England. ... The Giants also ruled linebacker Alec Ogletree (hamstring) and linebacker Tae Davis (concussion) out.\n\nMore updates\n\n\u2014Cleveland receiver Jarvis Landry cleared the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol, though his status for Monday night against San Francisco is expected to be announced after Saturday\u2019s practice. Landry suffered the concussion in the third quarter against Baltimore last Sunday. ... Chiefs coach Andy Reid said that running back Damien Williams is expected to play this weekend after missing the last two games with a knee injury.\n\n\u2014Standout Colts receiver T.Y. Hilton (quadriceps) and starting running back Marlon Mack (ankle) are questionable, while receiver Parris Campbell (abdomen), safeties Clayton Geathers (concussion) and Malik Hooker (quadriceps), and defensive lineman Tyquan Lewis (ankle) are all out against the Chiefs. ... Pittsburgh running back James Conner (ankle) was taken off the Steelers\u2019 injury report, while wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (toe) still isn\u2019t sure whether he will be on the field when the Ravens come to town Sunday.\n\n\u2014The Bears announced that receiver Taylor Gabriel (concussion), offensive lineman Ted Larsen (knee) and defensive tackle Bilal Nichols (hand) are out, while linebacker Roquan Smith, who missed last week\u2019s game for personal reasons, will play, as will offensive lineman Kyle Long (hip).\n\n\u2014Minnesota Vikings coach Mike Zimmer didn\u2019t shed much light on the status of wide receiver Stefon Diggs for Sunday\u2019s game against the Giants, as speculation has been rampant all week that Diggs wants to be traded. Diggs missed practice Wednesday with a cold but participated in full sessions on Thursday and Friday.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Friday saw no shortage of injury news in the NFL -- particularly pertaining to quarterbacks.
