Being in Glasgow amid the [pioneering indie label] Postcard scene was influential. Orange Juice were our heroes.\n\nMy idea was to be some sort of male Aretha Franklin, but then the five of us realised we could make this distinctive noise together. Between 1983 and 84, we went from being a wimpy band who sounded like the Style Council to more of a rock band. When I wrote Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken? it made us realise what we could do. I took a Portastudio to my room in Glasgow Golf Club, where my parents worked and lived, and wrote Perfect Skin and Forest Fire. Not one song on Rattlesnakes was more than a year old when it was recorded.\n\nMany of the songs are based on a year I spent in London studying law, when I was 18 or 19. The landscape for the album was my imagination. I\u2019d been to Europe once, but my romantic imagery was from books or films. I stumbled on a way of creating an image with very few words. Everyone knows exactly what a \u201cGrace Kelly car\u201d looks like, and it\u2019s probably in the south of France. I sang \u201cRead Norman Mailer, get a new tailor\u201d because he represented masculinity, the hard man. Similarly, Simone de Beauvoir represented modern feminist thinking.\n\nOn Perfect Skin, I sang \"she\u2019s sexually enlightened by Cosmopolitan\u201d. When I sing that live now, I go: \u201cWho isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nThe blue room in 2CV was really green, and it was Blair [Cowan, keyboards] who had the 2CV car. Charlotte Street is actually Upper Street in Islington, but it sounded lovelier. The girl is someone I went out with, who was older and more sophisticated, but she never said: \u201cDo you want to go to heaven or would you rather not be saved?\u201d\n\nPerfect Skin\u2019s Louise wasn\u2019t real, though. I\u2019d read about Bob Dylan seducing women by writing songs for them, so I was showing off with words: \u201cShe\u2019s got cheekbones like geometry and eyes like sin and she\u2019s sexually enlightened by Cosmopolitan.\u201d When I sing that live now, I go: \u201cWho isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nThe idea for the song Rattlesnakes came from a line in Joan Didion\u2019s book, Play It As It Lays: \u201cLife is a crap game, and there are rattlesnakes under every rock.\u201d I sing that someone \u201clooks like Eve Marie Saint\u201d because she looked how I thought these characters in my songs should look: beautiful fragility.\n\nIt was very exciting. We\u2019d been playing gigs to 500 people in Glasgow, but empty rooms in England. Then Perfect Skin came out, Radio 1 played us, we did Top of the Pops, and we never played an empty room again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trying to be a soul band \u2026 Lloyd Cole and the Commotions in Munich in 1985.

Lloyd was different then, awkward and gauche. He wore tweed, smoked Player\u2019s Navy Cut and had that hair, so he probably felt a bit weird in Glasgow.\n\nHe had an encyclopedic knowledge of pop music. We had black girl singers and were trying to be a soul band, when Bobby Bluebell interviewed us for a Glasgow magazine. He told Lloyd to listen to Dylan\u2019s Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde albums and he was right, that was the turning point. I wrote the chords for Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken? and Lloyd wrote the lyrics.\n\nThe arts weren\u2019t just for posh people. Most of us were on the dole, which gave us time to create. I woke up one morning with the riff for Rattlesnakes in my head. I said to my girlfriend: \u201cI\u2019ve got to get this down on the Portastudio NOW!\u201d She was like: \u201cYou\u2019ve what?\u201d\n\nGetting Paul Hardiman as producer was incredibly exciting. He\u2019d just finished the The\u2019s Soul Mining, and he was great at marshalling a young, naive bunch from Glasgow in our first major recording, working in John Foxx\u2019s Garden Studio in London. One night, the rest of the band wanted to go for a curry, but I wanted to put more guitar on Forest Fire.\n\nI came up with this epic solo, and Paul and I stayed up all night recording it. At 2am, with everything turned up, it sounded incredible, but the next day I thought we\u2019d gone over the top and wanted to take some of it off. Paul said: \u201cNo, play it to everyone as it is\u201d and everyone agreed it was incredible, so we left it.", "description": "\u2018I was showing off with words \u2013 I\u2019d read about Bob Dylan seducing women by writing songs for them\u2019", "authors": ["Dave Simpson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51668215fd016c829056dd38e3a364defaeb026b/117_161_3220_1931/master/3220.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a293429123c040d0506e6b4861f2682", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
