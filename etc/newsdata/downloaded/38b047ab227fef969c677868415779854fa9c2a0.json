To that messy trend, The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical is here to add rolls and rolls of toilet paper, shot over the audience\u2019s head with leaf blowers when its young hero summons streams of water to fight one of his mythical enemies. The young fans at my performance cheered like the ball was being dropped on New Year\u2019s Eve. I was delighted by the low-tech ingenuity, even if I did also feel like a suburban home those middle-schoolers had decided to vandalize, just in time for Halloween.\n\nYour degree of enjoyment of The Lightning Thief will probably depend on your feelings about the toilet paper, which is a pretty neat stand-in for the rest of this scrappy, loudly eager-to-please show. The story\u2019s based on the first of Rick Riordan\u2019s Percy Jackson & the Olympians young-adult novels that transplant Greek mythology into the present. Teen hero Percy \u2014 as in Perseus \u2014 Jackson never fit in at school, but surprise, surprise, it turns out his missing dad is actually a Greek god (his identity isn\u2019t exactly a spoiler, but let\u2019s just say his mom really loved the sea). After being attacked by a few monsters, he goes off to a magic training camp, where he meets a bunch of other superpowered demigod kids. As ever, these gods are really promiscuous. \u201cYeah, the gods are real,\u201d as everyone sings in an opening number seemingly written to be screamed in your bedroom after you\u2019ve been grounded, \u201cand they have kids / and those kids have issues! / Issues!\u201d\n\nIn case these plot points sound familiar, it\u2019s worth pointing out that this production bears little resemblance to the bland Percy Jackson movie adaptations and hews close to the cheeky tone of Riordan\u2019s actual books, which mash together the divine and ridiculous. In the show, Dionysus (a.k.a. \u201cMr. D\u201d) chugs Diet Coke, Medusa is dressed like she\u2019s just finished filming Grey Gardens, and the underworld happens to be located in Los Angeles (\u201cactually, I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Percy deadpans). In keeping with that spirit, The Lightning Thief renders its monsters with low-tech puppetry, and the show\u2019s MacGuffin, a stolen bolt of Zeus\u2019s lightning, resembles the electric lantern you\u2019d inevitably forget to bring on a camping trip. Everything falls on the \u201chomespun\u201d side of low-budget, a welcome respite from some of the more literal-minded stagings of common to more expensive Broadway spectacles. Though, as The Lightning Thief stretches over two acts, the scrappiness becomes a little cloying \u2014 after watching one character grunt and hack with a sword through one chaotic fight scene, I felt ready to skip through the rest.\n\nThe vibe in general feels indebted to The Lightning Thief\u2019s start as a TheaterworksUSA production in 2014, before it moved to a bigger Off Broadway house in 2017 and then launched on a national tour. There\u2019s also a kinship to Be More Chill, both in their off-kilter misfit-boy material and in their shared writer, Joe Tracz, and director, Stephen Brackett. Lightning Thief\u2019s 16-week Broadway run reunites most of its touring cast, and it brings back Chris McCarrell, who originally played Percy Off Broadway. He\u2019s got the knack of making Percy angsty, sarcastic, lonely, and pompous all at once, like a lizard, or just your average misfit teen. One of his best, so-dumb-it\u2019s-hilarious line readings, after being told he\u2019s looking at the pit of Tartarus: \u201cLike,\u201d McCarrell asks, basking in a pause, \u201cthe fish sauce?\u201d\n\nApart from those jokes, the bones of The Lightning Thief are pretty standard post-Potter YA: There\u2019s a lot of watching one lonely boy learn that he\u2019s special, and meeting his supportive friend group, and finally seeing him actually get to be special. The score, by Rob Rokicki, is full of big ballads (and some of the ensemble members start to grate by hitting those notes too hard), there are lots of moments when the lights converge on Percy and he performs an emotional collapse while delivering lines like \u201cI try and try to be a good kid!\u201d as the show slides into a sort of Dear Joseph Campbell bathos. As charming as he is, I found myself wishing for a story less about Percy, the kind of character we\u2019ve seen so much of in the past, and more with his friends, especially Kristin Stokes\u2019s Annabeth, an Elizabeth Warren\u2013esque demigod daughter of Athena who always has a plan. She serves the function of this story\u2019s Hermione, more competent and yet somehow less important than the male lead.\n\nBut it\u2019s probably too much to ask that The Lightning Thief provide some revisionist take on its source material, considering its straightforward aims. This is a show built for its fans, not to the point of excluding everyone else, but definitely at the risk of alienating them a bit. As a newcomer, you may feel like you\u2019re an interloper at someone else\u2019s birthday party, unsure of why they keep serving blue food, which is apparently a Percy Jackson in-reference. You may flinch at the dorkiness, but if you\u2019re in the mood to join in and let the t.p. fly, there\u2019s fun to be had.\n\nThe Lightning Thief is at the Longacre Theatre.", "description": "Theater Review: The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre through December 2019", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/16/16-lightning-thief.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
