You spend so much time defending and when you want to catch your breath and get on the ball for a bit, they\u2019ve taken it from you again.\n\n\u201cI think Jurgen now has the team he first had in mind when he started four years ago.\u201d\n\nArsenal entered the game having started their Premier League season with wins over Newcastle and Burnley, and they have since drawn with North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Meanwhile, Liverpool have won all four of their league games, and were also victorious against Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup.\n\nCeballos believes that Emery can bring a similar efficiency and success to Arsenal, given time. Last year, in his first season at the Emirates, the Spanish coach took his side to the Europa League final, just as Klopp did in his first term at Liverpool. Like Arsenal, Klopp\u2019s side lost that match \u2013 and to Emery\u2019s Sevilla FC, no less.\n\n\u201cIn [Emery\u2019s] first season, Arsenal finish just a point short of the Champions League and are just a small step from winning the Europa League,\u201d Ceballos said.\n\n\u201cHis arrival has been really positive for the club and will be positive in the long term. In a few years, Arsenal can be one of the top 10 sides in the world, able to compete for everything.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal\u00a0midfielder Dani Ceballos has said he has never seen a team that plays better than Jurgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool\u00a0and picked out their pressing as being particularly impressive.
