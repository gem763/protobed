There will be headlines if I say this, that or the other. If you are going to survive in modern-day football, you have to be fit.\n\nLuke Shaw has struggled to shake off persistent injury problems since joining United\n\nJesse Lingard became the latest United player to pick up a knock during Europa League clash\n\n'You have to be fitter than they were when I came in. We are working on it and they will get there.'\n\nOnly Norwich City have had more first-team absentees this season than United and Solskjaer has indicated Pogba won't be risked at St James' Park as he battles against a recurring ankle knock.\n\nThe number of muscular issues will also trouble the Norwegian.\n\nMartial and Shaw haven't played since the end of August due to thigh and hamstring injuries respectively, while Lingard is also ruled out on Sunday with a thigh strain.\n\nEric Bailly and Timothy Fosu-Mensah have had significant time off with knee injuries and United have cited injury as the reason Phil Jones didn't travel to Holland. Wan-Bissaka has missed the last couple of games with tonsillitis.\n\nIt's all added to a worrying start to the season for United who look as far away from challenging the top clubs as at any time since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\n\nPaul Pogba (left) and Anthony Martial (right) have both been sidelined with injuries\n\nThe current manager insists he is not flinching from the task ahead and seems to have the full backing of United's board who recognise it is necessary to have a long-term rebuild.\n\nSolskjaer said: 'Do you know my career? It's been loads of ups but some downs as well, both as a player and as a coach. In Molde and Cardiff, I've had tough times.\n\n'I do what I believe in and, in the end, it's turned out to come good. If you get time to do what you are setting out to do, it'll be fine.\n\n'This is a period now with some fine lines going against us but we'll get there.\n\n'There's only once this season where we didn't deserve to get too much out of the game.'\n\nOnly Norwich City have been without more first-team players than United this season\n\nUnited would already consider a top-four finish a success with Liverpool and Manchester City at the top, and rivals Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal and Leicester all ahead of them in the race for the Champions League.\n\n'There are two teams that look like going away with things,' added Solskjaer.\n\n'The rest of us are going to fight for those third and fourth positions. We have two more points than in the same games last season, so it's not all that bad.\n\n'It's going to turn round. You've got to be strong when you play for Manchester United.\n\n'We talk to the players and work on their mentality. You have to trust yourself and what you are doing.'", "description": "Solskjaer has made it a priority to improve fitness levels he felt were lacking under his predecessor Jose Mourinho but an increase in training intensity has coincided with a run of issues.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/23/19344504-0-image-a-40_1570312914565.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
