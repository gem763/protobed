A philosophical Barty preferred to reflect on a watershed grand slam season, highlighted by her magical French Open triumph in June, than mope about after a 6-2, 6-4 loss to Qiang Wang on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible. Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s a tough day at the office today, but it\u2019s been a year where we\u2019ve hit our goals. Obviously I would have loved to have kept going here in singles, but we\u2019ve got an opportunity to do that in doubles,\u201d Barty said.\n\nSerena Williams survives injury scare to breeze past Petra Martic Read more\n\n\u201cKnowing what it was like last year to be able to lift the trophy in doubles was really cool. To be able to have another opportunity to do that now, still being able to play in doubles, is a bonus. We\u2019ve had a great season in grand slams for singles. We\u2019ve made the second week every single one, which has been really special. Now we\u2019ll sit back, reflect and look forward to a big couple months to finish off the year.\u201d\n\nWorld No 18 Wang was the highest-ranked rival Barty had played since the French Open semi-finals two months ago \u2013 and she was simply unable to rise to the occasion. The second seed\u2019s numbers told the story, Barty committing 39 unforced errors in 18 games and unable to convert any of nine break-point chances.\n\n\u201cQ was very good, very solid. I felt like she was able to put the ball with great depth in difficult positions for me,\u201d Barty said. \u201cI still was able to create opportunities. Just very frustrating that on the big points today, Q played a lot better.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating now. Again, give me an hour and I\u2019ll be right. It\u2019s an opportunity, it\u2019s a new day tomorrow. Just because we\u2019ve had a tough hour and a half on the court, it doesn\u2019t reflect on the year that I\u2019ve had or the couple of weeks I\u2019ve had here in New York. It\u2019s still going. Still have an opportunity to try to do well with Vika [Azarenka] tomorrow.\u201d\n\nChampion last year with Coco Vandeweghe, Barty and Azarenka are through to the last 16 of the women\u2019s doubles. The eighth seeds will play American teenage sensation Coco Gauff and fellow prodigy Caty McNally a quarter-final destined for Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\n\u201cObviously playing with Coco last year, I had every intention to play with Coco in Australia [at the start of the year], kind of begin that again,\u201d Barty said of her switch in partners. But after her [ankle] injury, it was a bit of a last-minute thing where I just texted Vika and said: \u2019Look, I don\u2019t have a partner. Would you be keen to play in Australia? We\u2019ve just kind of gone from there.\u201d\n\nThere was disappointment too for Barty\u2019s compatriot Alex de Minaur in the men\u2019s draw, after Grigor Dimitrov handed the Australian a grand slam reality check. The former world No 3 crushed ousted de Minaur 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 in their fourth-round match.\n\nIt was a deflating departure for the 20-year-old who had been eyeing his maiden grand slam quarter-final after claiming the biggest scalp of his career in round three. De Minaur\u2019s victory two days ago over world No.7 Kei Nishikori, the 2014 runner-up in New York, had the Australian favourite to advance.\n\nDimitrov has slumped to 78th in the world after winning only one match since Wimbledon until this week and enduring a humiliating loss to world No 405 Kevin King last month in Atlanta, where De Minaur collected his second title of the year.\n\nBut after suffering five first-round defeats in his past six tournaments, the 2017 season-ending championship winner has rediscovered his touch at the final slam of the year.", "description": "Ashleigh Barty has set her sights on retaining the US Open doubles crown after crashing out of the singles with a fourth-round shocker", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bbfd3b4f8fe57cba742c30c0a2161e74f0023d1/0_21_3352_2012/master/3352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f226aecb7cb547aa85120b70a570389"}
