It lists several possible misdeeds like wasting food, cranking air conditioning and routinely consuming steak.\n\n\"Even those who care deeply about the planet's future can slip up now and then. Tell us: Where do you fall short in preventing climate change? Do you blast the A/C? Throw out half your lunch? Grill a steak every week? Share your anonymous confession with NBC News,\" the webpage says.\n\nPeople can choose to disclose their own confession or peruse the confessions posted by others. Those who decide to confess must select one of six categories in which they \"fall short in preventing climate change\" and then describe their dastardly deeds within 130 characters.\n\n\"I drive my gas powered car to work every day by myself,\" one person wrote. \"My commute is less than 4 miles, and public transportation is available.\"\n\n\"I use paper towels instead of a cloth to wipe my kitchen counter,\" another confessor wrote.\n\n\"I travel often to conferences (flying). I think about the emissions + try to justify it with, 'the plane is going there anyway,'\" another person said.\n\nBut not everyone was on board. Some of the comments offered mockery or took a shot at leftist climate change ideology.\n\n\"I think the climate has always been changing, and I'm not going to stop eating meat because of cult-like manipulation by the left,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"I like my house to be 85 in he winter and 55 in the summer,\" another person wrote, adding \"Deal with it, hippies.\"\n\n\"I run my AC 24/7. I'm not going to sweat to appease this climate religion,\" another wrote.", "description": ".09/18/2019 19:19:34PM EST.", "authors": ["Alex Nitzberg", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/43/07bca2a3-028c-4b1b-a3b9-59a966f53f66.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
