Behind her just-released memoir My Story, Corby has been doing the rounds of various media outlets this morning, opening up on the extreme mental health issues she experienced while in Kerobokan prison, and the adjustments she had to make to the modern world once she was released in 2014.\n\nCorby appeared on Kyle & Jackie O on KIIS FM earlier this morning and spoke of her experience inside the notorious Bali prison, where she spent nine years after being convicted of attempting to smuggle 4.2kg of weed into the country inside a bodyboard bag.\n\nNamely, she described a pair of incidents in which she ran afoul of prison guards. The first of which involved her being caught crawling through the ceiling of the facility, where she told guards she believed she was looking for \u201cducks.\u201d The second of which involved her being caught with a Nokia mobile phone, which resulted in her being thrown into solitary confinement for three weeks and later lead to her developing a deep phobia of talking on the phone.\n\nLater on, she spoke of her struggles with mental illness while incarcerated; issues that she claims got so bad that at one point she was rendered nearly catatonic, requiring her sister Mercedes to actually come into the prison cell and sleep next to her.\n\nIn a live TV interview with Studio 10, Corby expanded on the issues she faced, as well as the on-going struggles she has with traumatic flashbacks, all the while maintaining her innocence.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: In her first TV interview since returning to Australia, Schapelle Corby opened up about her daily battle with mental illness after her nine years in prison. #Studio10 pic.twitter.com/0ehl3YWzdS \u2014 Studio 10 (@Studio10au) October 30, 2019\n\nCorby also revealed she is still together with her Sumatran boyfriend, however they only get to see each other once a year due to his reluctance to move to Australia, and her probably understandable unwillingness to travel back to Bali at this point in time.\n\nAs for the one thing that\u2019s confused her the most about modern life outside of prison, Schapelle told KIIS that it\u2019s apparently the abundance of plastic in supermarkets, of all things.\n\n\u201cEverything is wrapped up. You want to buy a carrot and it\u2019s wrapped in plastic, styrofoam, all this plastic. And then they take the plastic bags away, but it\u2019s still in the fruit-and-veg section. It\u2019s full of plastic, so I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nFair point, tbh.", "description": "Schapelle Corby made an incredibly rare appearance on live TV earlier this morning, and opened up on her horrific mental health struggles while in prison.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/schapelle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
