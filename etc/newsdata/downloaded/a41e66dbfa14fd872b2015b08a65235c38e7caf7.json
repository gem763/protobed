He was stood up choking and coughing so I banged his back but then he slid forward onto the floor.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDarren was taken to hospital but the damage was so far down his throat it could not be seen without specialist equipment and he died just after midnight.\n\nAustistic boy 'abducted' and taken to Russia by his mum\n\nActing senior coroner Alan Walsh said: \u2018He was enormously positive and enormously caring and gave to charity \u2013 he was a very generous, caring and compassionate man.\n\n\u2018He was a remarkably strong and resilient man to overcome that stroke.\u2019\n\nA pathologist said the case was very rare and is normally associated with people killed in house fires who inhale smoke, burning the airways.\n\nDr Patrick Waugh said: \u2018The patient can appear well, they will be talking to you, but then the swelling starts.\u2019\n\nThe damage was so far down Darren\u2019s throat that it could only be seen using specialist kit (Picture: SWNS)\n\nBolton Coroners\u2019 Court heard a full review into the incident would be carried out. Mr Hickey\u2019s cause of death was given as asphyxiation.\n\nRecording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Walsh said: \u2018I believe there are enormous lessons to be learned.\n\nMan's Uber ride costs \u00a31400 after he dozed off and woke up in the Midlands\n\n\u2018This was caused by eating a fishcake, very small and very hot but with catastrophic consequences. I find this an immense tragedy.\u2019\n\nSpeaking after the inquest, Neil Parkinson, 55, said: \u2018Darren was a larger than life character, always helping other people and was the centre of attention.\n\n\u2018He would take over a room if he walked in.
