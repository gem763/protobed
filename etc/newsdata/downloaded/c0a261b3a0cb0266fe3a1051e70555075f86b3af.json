Photo: John Fleenor/ABC\n\nContrary to the belief of a reality TV cynic, Bachelor in Paradise has quite a decent track record of engagements and legitimate relationships when the cameras stop rolling outside the constraints a single strip of a Mexican beach. Did its sixth season fair any differently? Well, it\u2019s not too shabby! Of the four couples who decided to go to the \u201cfantasy suites\u201d in the finale on Tuesday evening, three persisted into the real world, and a few other duos are also happily pursing a future with each other. As a convenient BiP recap of everything that happened between the main couples, here\u2019s what you need to know. Oh, and also, that windmill sex guy is the new Bachelor lead.\n\nDean and Caelynn\n\nStatus before leaving the show: They decided to leave on their own terms earlier this season, after Dean unexpectedly returned to apologize and affirm his love for Caelynn. He initiated their departure.\n\n\ufeffStatus after the show: They\u2019re still together, and all over Instagram with their #vanlife goals. \u201cI\u2019m surprised but I actually love it!\u201d Caelynn said about living full-time in a vehicle. Check her Insta if you\u2019re still skeptical.\n\nJohn Paul Jones and Tayshia\n\nStatus before leaving the show: Tayshia broke up with John Paul Jones before the fantasy suites. It was brutal. Everyone was crying.\n\nStatus after the show: Cue the awes, they\u2019re back together! With a camera crew in tow, Tayshia flew to Maryland to win her boo back, after coming to the realization that her feelings ran much, much deeper than she realized. \u201cWe had a whirlwind romance, and I think it took me by surprise,\u201d Tayshia told Chris Harrison before the reunion footage was shown. \u201cWhen he told me he loved me, those were words that I don\u2019t throw around lightly. I wasn\u2019t ready for that. I thought the right thing to do was just to let him go \u2026 I talked to my mom about it and I decided I wanted to go after him. I\u2019m a bold girl.\u201d JPJ, unsurprisingly, took her back immediately, and confirmed they\u2019re still dating: \u201cLook at my girlfriend, isn\u2019t she hot?!\u201d\n\nChris and Katie\n\nStatus before leaving the show: Engaged.\n\nStatus after the show: Technically speaking, yes. But not too happily, if we\u2019re being honest. Katie initially appeared without her ring at the reunion, and admitted she felt consistently neglected by Chris since they left the beach. \u201cWe\u2019re still engaged,\u201d she assured viewers. \u201cI just put in so much effort every day and I love him so much, but I put in so much that my tank empties and if I\u2019m not getting it filled, I break down. The whole time at the beach he would tell others that he loves me and the only way I knew Chris loves me is the way he tells everyone else, not the way he shows me. I love him, but I can\u2019t speak as to how he makes me feel and the things he said and the things he did seemed so different. I fell in love with potential that may never come to fruition, but I\u2019m just praying it does.\u201d Katie eventually put her ring back on, after this assurance from Chris: \u201cMy family loves you, my friends love you, and I love you. I do and I think there\u2019s so many more better days ahead of us and I want to see those days, I really do.\u201d\n\nClay and Nicole\n\n\ufeffStatus before leaving the show: This was a pretty bad breakup, y\u2019all. After Nicole declared her full, undivided love for Clay, he said he wasn\u2019t prepared to initiate any next relationship milestone. \u201cI\u2019m not there yet,\u201d he explained. \u201cHaving those feelings, it\u2019s not easy for me and it\u2019s scary. But I know one thing \u2014 that I\u2019m starting to fall in love with you. I\u2019m not ready to move in together or get down on one knee right now, but I know what I want and that\u2019s for us to take things slow and to leave here together.\u201d Nicole, specifically wanting a proposal, proceeded to dump his ass on the spot: \u201cI have to do what\u2019s best for me right now. And I can\u2019t tell people that we\u2019re together knowing that you don\u2019t love me back.\u201d\n\nStatus after the show: We\u2019re assuming these two are still totally, completely dunzo. Neither of them, in a pretty uncharacteristic move for BiP, were present at the reunion show. Angela must be thrilled.\n\nDemi and Kristian\n\nStatus before leaving the show: Engaged! As the franchise\u2019s first same-sex couple, Demi initiated the proposal to Kristian. \u201cI know that this has been really hard. I\u2019ve put you through struggles and you were always there for me regardless of how much I didn\u2019t deserve it at the time,\u201d Demi said before she proposed. \u201cI never knew that someone could be that patient. There were a lot of things that came between us, mostly myself and my own struggles. Like you said, I came here to find myself. But I found myself in you.\u201d\n\n\ufeffStatus after the show: Still engaged! Neil Lane also gave Kristian a blinged-out ring so she could propose to Demi at the reunion show, too. \u201cI know that last day in Paradise was the best day of my life and I wouldn\u2019t want to do this life with anyone but you,\u201d Kristian told her.\n\nDylan and Hannah\n\nStatus before leaving the show: Engaged, obviously. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to spend my summer with you, I came here to spend my life with you,\u201d Dylan told her during the proposal. \u201cAnd I\u2019m ready for that life to start now.\u201d\n\nStatus after the show: Still engaged, obviously.", "description": "Bachelor in Paradise ended on Tuesday evening.
