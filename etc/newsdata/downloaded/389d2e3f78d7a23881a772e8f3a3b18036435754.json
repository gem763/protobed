Regardless of how you cast your vote, our team will work hard for all Canadians. \u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) October 22, 2019\n\nAs the results came in early on Tuesday, there was a mixed reaction on Twitter.\n\nSupporters in Canada and abroad congratulated Trudeau, but there was also criticism, with some alluding to the recent scandals that rocked the incumbent's election campaign.\n\n\"Congrats for a second term Justin Trudeau! Better is always possible. Let these next four years be greater. Let's move forward,\" wrote Nancy Boyoko.\n\n\"Trudeau being re-elected was the probably the best Canada could realistically do tonight,\" another Twitter user said.\n\nCongrats for a second term Justin Trudeau! Better is always possible. Let these next 4 years be greater. Let\u2019s move forward.

I've lost faith in my fellow Canadians.\"\n\nTrudeau has gotten away with everything, corruption, bullying of females, lies, groping, #blackface, showing up to work high, not showing up to work, spending money we dont have, open borders, not answering questions. I've lost faith in my fellow Canadians. Soros must be thrilled \u2014 Esther Bartkiw (@soul_whispers) October 22, 2019\n\nLeftists in Canada just elected Justin Trudeau again, a guy with 3 blackface scandals and a #MeToo scandal... Leftists remain consistent in their ability to embrace double standards. \u2014 Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) October 22, 2019\n\n'Classless'\n\nMany also called out Trudeau for beginning his victory speech while Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer was conceding defeat.\n\n\"Classless. Trudeau ignores agreement to wait for runner-up to finish his speech first, and doesn't even mention opponents by name,\" said Derek Fildebrandt, president and CEO of Wildrose Media Corporation.\n\nAnother Twitter user wrote: \"A complete lack of respect for each other by the leaders of the three main Canadian parties. To get up and start your speech while another party leader is speaking makes you a really low form of life.\"\n\nClassless. Trudeau ignores agreement to wait for runner up to finish his speech first, and doesn\u2019t even mention opponents by name. #cdnpoli #ableg \u2014 Derek Fildebrandt (@Dfildebrandt) October 22, 2019\n\nTrudeau's new 'humility' after losing his majority government: He started his victory speech seconds after Scheer began his concession speech, causing CTV to cut off Scheer's speech & switch to Trudeau. The standard practice is that the winner of the election speak last #cdnpoli \u2014 Lorrie Goldstein (@sunlorrie) October 22, 2019\n\nJustin Trudeau decided to steal Andrew Scheer's airtime by coming on state moments into Scheer's concession speech. Classless. \u2014 Andrew Lawton (@AndrewLawton) October 22, 2019\n\nThis is so weird. All three are fighting for airtime.\n\nTrudeau is getting it. pic.twitter.com/2G6lhvD8Oc \u2014 Tonda MacCharles (@TondaMacC) October 22, 2019\n\nCongratulations to @JustinTrudeau on a wonderful and hard fought victory. Canada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries! \u2014 Donald J.
