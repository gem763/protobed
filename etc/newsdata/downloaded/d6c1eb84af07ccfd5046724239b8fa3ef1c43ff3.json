Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said \u201cmany issues\u201d must be resolved before an exit deal for the U.K. can be reached, according to media reports, while an EU official said any deal would be unlikely without more U.K. concessions, said a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe pound shot to a June high briefly later in the afternoon, after Irish broadcaster RTE reported the Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party was accepting the so-called consent element of the revised Brexit agreement, seen as the last big obstacle to a deal. But the pound backed down after DUP\u2019s leader Arlene Foster reportedly denied the report and said talks will continue.\n\nThe pound GBPUSD, +0.2112%, which has swung back and forth in recent sessions on Brexit headlines, was last trading flat at $1.2793 against the dollar.\n\nElsewhere, shares of ASOS PLC ASC, +23.52% soared 20% after the U.K. online retailer reported a 68% drop in profit for fiscal 2019, but said the new fiscal year has gotten off to a solid start.\n\n\u201cThe initial share price reaction to the results reflect a leap of faith, after management assurances that the latter part of the year was rather more positive, to the extent that it can look forward to the next period with confidence,\u201d said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, in a note to clients.", "description": "U.K. stocks are weak, while the pound is volatile with all eyes on Brexit negotiations.", "authors": ["Barbara Kollmeyer", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT388_brexit_ZG_20191016040022.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
