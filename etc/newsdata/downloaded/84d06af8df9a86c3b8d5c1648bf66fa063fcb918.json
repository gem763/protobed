The frenzy cooled Tuesday, with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Information Technology Index losing as much as 1.4%. Bitcoin was 2.1% lower at $9,260.\n\nRegulation for blockchain need to be improved as the technology is still at an early stage, according to the People\u2019s Daily commentary, which was published on the WeChat account of the paper\u2019s opinion department. Technical innovations on blockchain aren\u2019t the same as speculative trading of virtual currencies, it said.\n\n\u201cThe message is clear -- companies should focus on their main business and not jump on the blockchain bandwagon,\u201d said Sun Jianbo, president of China Vision Capital Management. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning that support for the sector does not equal an endorsement of speculative trading.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s exchange operator also weighed in, sending inquiries to at least four firms whose shares jumped 10% Monday, including MYS Group Co. The companies were asked to spell out their involvement in blockchain technology and warn investors of the many risks that could affect their share price.\n\nChinese investors are no stranger to speculative trades -- so far this year they\u2019ve chased stocks linked to the next generation of telecom network 5G, industrial cannabis and hog breeders. While these stocks often offer some quick gains, the stakes are just as high once the trades unravel quickly.\n\nState-controlled newspapers often run market commentary when moves get extreme, with a hugely profitable sneakers trade drawing their attention just this month. Their front pages can also signal Beijing\u2019s support for the market: in February, newspapers highlighted the growing bull case for Chinese shares, adding fuel to the stock rally.\n\n--With assistance from Joanna Ossinger.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Amanda Wang in Shanghai at twang234@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sofia Horta e Costa at shortaecosta@bloomberg.net, Richard Frost\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s state media said investors should avoid speculative behavior after comments by President Xi Jinping sent blockchain-related stocks surging on Monday.\u201cThe future is here for blockchain, but we need to stay rational,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily said in a commentary.More than 70 tech shares", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FB5iFFPMaxZYLhg.reu49A--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/6581712ff8e5f9cd183d1cdb7cf6d763", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
