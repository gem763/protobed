He said the couple owned it for just a year.\n\nThomas said: 'It's disgusting what's happened.\n\n'I went to the British police as we were the registered owners in Bulgaria. I phoned them myself.\n\nThe couple said they sold the lorry to a company near to where Mo Robinson (above) lives\n\n'They were happy we had come forward. They are well aware of who they are dealing with.\n\n'It's not nice to be associated with this. We're shocked.'\n\nThe couple have three children - two boys aged 18 and 11, and a 15-year-old girl.\n\nThey own two Grey Range Rovers - one with a personalised number plate - and a white Chevrolet sports car.\n\nThey purchased their detached modern \u00a3250,000 home in Warrington, Cheshire two years ago.\n\nMrs Maher registered the vehicle at a run down 10-storey building in the seaside resort of Varna.\n\nThe lorry which carried the refrigerated unit holding 39 bodies left the day after it was registered and has never been back to Bulgaria.\n\nBulgarian officials believe that there may be no other connection to the country, other than the PO Box and registration certificate.\n\nOne resident of the number seven building in Varna said: 'There have been many, many companies using that small office for business here.\n\n'It is locked up now. I have never seen anybody there. The letters used to be put up against the wall and somebody would have to come and collect them. It has been secured and is disused.'", "description": "Joanna Maher, 38, from Warrington, was named as the keeper of the Scania truck that was registered in the Bulgarian Black Sea port of Varna in 2018.", "authors": ["Shekhar Bhatia In Varna", "Stewart Whittingham For Mailonline", "James Fielding For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/21/20153408-0-image-a-20_1571950421301.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
