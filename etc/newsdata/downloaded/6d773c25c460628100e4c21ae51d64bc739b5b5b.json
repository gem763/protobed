Designers championed female empowerment, with more than a few show notes lauding the \u201cstrong women\u201d who inspired collections. Muses were mothers, daughters, and sisters.\n\nHeels were (slightly) more manageable than seasons past, with Gigi Hadid even walking barefoot. Women should finally dress for themselves, right down to their underwear, Rihanna commanded.\n\nBut off the runway, it seemed all women wanted to do was match their partners.\n\nAs the New York Post and Daily Mail gleefully reported, Miley Cyrus and her new \u201cbombshell girlfriend\u201d Kaitlynn Carter made out all over New York\u2019s trendiest basements in coordinated all-black ensembles.\n\nThe singer Dua Lipa stepped out for the first time in public with her boyfriend, Anwar Hadid, in harmonized outfits of cartoon T-shirts and candy heart jewelry, looking like two grown adults in children\u2019s clothes trying to sneak into a Chuck E. Cheese birthday party for the free pizza.\n\nFrench influencers Alice Barbier and Jean-Sebastien Roques, who simply describe themselves as a \u201c#couple\u201d in their Instagram bio, showed up to a host of shows united in sartorial bliss.\n\nOf course, women can be happily coupled and retain their own sense of self; wanting to dress like a significant other does not itself signal codependency. But if the #MeToo movement kicked off fashion\u2019s obsession with a liberated, modern women, synchronized \u2018fits could be equivalent to Reagan-era resistance of popular feminism.\n\nThat said, coordinated dressing is not just for lovers. Plenty of fashion week-ers styled themselves in groups with friends. It could have been a visual (or performative) nod to the value of female camaraderie, or an attempt to communicate they\u2019re in-demand enough to have a squad of their own. Or perhaps we\u2019re all just drawn to people who look like us.\n\n\u201cThe psychology behind it is that we\u2019re attracted to what feels familiar, safe, and normal,\u201d Rachel A. Sussman, a New York-based therapist who specializes in relationship issues, told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt feels like family. It\u2019s like a tribe. I\u2019m always so interested when I see a new couple; they always look like each other\u2014sometimes they look like brother and sister.\u201d\n\nSara Covey, a Chicago-based influencer who matched with her friend Alexis May all week, agrees there is something childish about the \u201cyouthful\u201d trend. \u201cMy mom would always put matching dresses and oversized bows on my older sister and me as we were growing up,\u201d she said. \u201cI really enjoy the nostalgia that it brings, as well as the community it creates. It is a trend that requires a person outside yourself to coordinate with.\u201d\n\nCovey said that most of her \u201ctwin outfits\u201d with May have been planned, but some were orchestrated \u201cbecause we happened to share the same outfit.\u201d During a trip to Hawaii, the pair \u201cunknowingly\u201d packed duplicate hats, pants, and sandals. The only noticeable difference between the two women, who hold hands in the shot, is the length of their hair\u2014mid-length and a lob, respectively, both styled in loose waves.\n\nDitto for when the pair went to Charleston, South Carolina, both bringing high-rise, straight-cut blue jeans, white tops, and bucket hats. \u201cThe outfits were packed separately without knowing that we had brought the same things,\u201d Covey said. Sometimes, she admitted, the coordination is intentional, curated exclusively for the Instagram picture.\n\n\u201cWe all want to feel like we belong, like we\u2019re part of a group,\u201d Dawnn Karen, a fashion psychologist and adjunct professor at FIT, said. \u201cDressing alike can allow this camaraderie that fills this need or desire of belonging. It reminds me of groups\u2014the popular kids, the cool kids.\u201d\n\nLauren Caruso, site director of The Zoe Report, attended shows alongside her entourage of senior fashion editor Aemilia Madden and contributing senior style editor Mecca James-Williams. On the second day of the week, the team showed up united in shades of pink and orange. \u201cNone of us discussed it beforehand,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cIt was a happy surprise that made for a great street style moment.\u201d\n\nShowing up to an event wearing the same outfit as someone else used to be a clich\u00e9d, if ubiquitous, fear. Friends with dinner plans would share what they planned to wear to ward off any copycats, and young women created Facebook groups where they would call dibs on their preferred prom dresses. No one wanted to be Lucille Ball in Marx Brothers drag, waving at the real Harpo through a \u201cmirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have enough confidence and are coming from a space of insecurity you\u2019re going to be triggered when you see someone in the same outfit,\u201d Karen said. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel like your individuality is taken away and you can\u2019t stand out.\u201d\n\nBut fashion \u201crules\u201d are becoming increasingly pass\u00e9. Just this week, two women attended Cynthia Rowley\u2019s presentation in identical plaid tulle skirts, lavender turtlenecks, and crossbody bags, posing for photos together arm-and-arm, megawatt smiles on their faces.\n\nStill, history treats dual dressing with a touch of the absurd\u2014or creepy (think: Jennifer Jason Leigh cutting her hair to match Bridget Fonda\u2019s in Single White Female).\n\nTwentieth century comedic duos like Laurel and Hardy, the Smothers Brothers, and Penn & Teller wore similar suits. Howard (Stanley Lebor) and Hilda (Geraldine Newman) finished each other's sentences in matching twee knitwear, in the BBC\u2019s Ever Decreasing Circles. Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s matching black turtlenecks on the Bookends album cover has become the stuff of parody, or at least last-minute Halloween costumes.\n\nSame with Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake\u2019s double denim-on-denim 2001 red carpet moment, which has been seared into pop culture history. (In 2016, Spears\u2019 gown sold for over $7000 at auction. The whereabouts of Timberlake\u2019s suit\u2014and questionable fedora\u2014remains unknown.)\n\n\u201c Men typically look the same; it\u2019s homogeneous, and they naturally dress alike. In general, women will dress alike on purpose \u201d\n\nAs with many things considered unserious by The People In Charge, dressing similarly has become associated with girl culture and young women. Karenn, the fashion psychologist, believes that mindset has less to do with sexism and more to do with the fact that most men are conditioned to dress similarly anyway.\n\n\u201cGuess what, women have more options,\u201d Karenn said. \u201cMen typically look the same; it\u2019s homogeneous, and they naturally dress alike. In general, women will dress alike on purpose, but men will [do so] because it\u2019s what society expects of them.\u201d\n\nCovey, the Chicago influencer, said her \u201cultimate matching icons\u201d are the Olsen Twins, who were forced into identical costumes since their infancy, when both played Michelle Tanner on the sitcom Full House.\n\nAs teens, the two went off to study at New York University, where they were relentlessly followed by paparazzi, who frequently caught them looking alike in the Olsen uniform of a tank top, bootcut jeans, oversized sweater, Starbucks latte, and occasional cigarette. (Remember, it was the mid-aughts.)\n\nMore than 30 years later, the two run The Row, a minimalist clothing line which also showed this week. The puffy bows and baggy sweatpants of their past have been replaced with tailored black pants and crisp white button-ups. Still, the spring collection is a revolving door of black and white ensemble that strip models of any semblance of personality. Conformity, it appears, will be so hot this spring.", "description": "As seen at New York Fashion Week, celebrities and influencers are enlisting friends or partners to copy their outfits. \u201cIt feels like family,\u201d one told The Daily Beast.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568398351/190913-Demopoulos-NYFW-tease_sdanjz", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
