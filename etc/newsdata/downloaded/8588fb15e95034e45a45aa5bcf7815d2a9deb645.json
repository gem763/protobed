But why?", "language": "en", "text": "A 2010 study published in the European Journal of Marketing showed that your level of \u201cpolitical salience\u201d \u2014 that is, the degree of information about and interest in politics \u2014 determines whether celebrity endorsements work on you. The authors found that if you have low salience, a celebrity endorsement will increase your intention to vote for a politician or party by 28 percent (compared with an endorsement by someone who isn\u2019t famous). But if you have high political salience, the celebrity endorsement will lower your intention to support the politician by 11 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn other words, celebrity endorsements are good only for convincing people who don\u2019t care much about politics or follow what\u2019s going on. What happens if the politician is also a celebrity? Say \u2014 just hypothetically, of course \u2014 a reality-TV star? No studies of that have been conducted, that I\u2019m aware of. But feel free to speculate.\n\nNow here\u2019s a new twist, one that mixes our fixation on fame with today\u2019s political vortex of negativity: the celebrity anti-endorsement. In this phenomenon, a politician who is criticized by a celebrity uses the attack to gain support from people who dislike that celebrity.\n\nConsider Sanders\u2019s campaign website, which features a page literally titled \u201cAnti-Endorsements.\u201d \u201cI ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made,\u201d the Sanders page says, followed by a list of famous people, mostly from the worlds of business and finance, who have criticized him. Upon unveiling the list, Sanders said, \u201cThese people have a vested interest in preserving the status quo so they can keep their grip on power so they can continue to exploit working people across America.\u201d He added this flourish: \u201cWe welcome their hatred.\" (Sanders is recovering at home after suffering a heart attack on Oct. 1 and has vowed to return to campaigning soon.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat were the hateful things said about Sanders? To take one example, JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon made the list for saying about Sanders\u2019s economic populism, \u201cJust because it resonates doesn\u2019t make it right.\u201d Frankly, that doesn\u2019t qualify as \u201chatred\u201d in my book \u2014 more like \u201cmild disagreement\u201d \u2014 but it was enough to deem him an enemy.\n\nWhile Sanders has employed the anti-endorsement in its barest form, he is far from alone, of course. President Trump has mastered the technique by complaining about negative reporting of his presidency by the mainstream media, whom he deems an \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d Nor is embracing the anti-endorsement limited to politicians. Recently, many were surprised when Pope Francis said, in response to a journalist asking about U.S. criticisms of his papacy, \u201cFor me, it\u2019s an honor that Americans are attacking me.\u201d\n\nThe anti-endorsement technique seems to assume there is a kind of transitive property for hate. It goes something like this: Are you trying to figure out if you like and support me? Well, you hate certain rich and famous people, right? They hate me. Therefore, you must like me!\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe don\u2019t have any research evidence on the efficacy of this strategy. Personally, I\u2019m skeptical. Anti-endorsements might be seen as a political analog to \u201chumblebragging\u201d \u2014 the social media phenomenon of making a self-deprecating comment or complaint that is actually a boast. A humblebrag on Twitter might be something like, \u201cOn my way to meet the President and stuck in DC traffic! I never leave enough time!\u201d\n\nMy Harvard Business School colleagues Francesca Gino and Michael Norton (with Ovul Sezer of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) tested the effectiveness of humblebragging in a 2018 article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. They found it doesn\u2019t work; people see through it and find it disingenuous and repellent. Humblebragging is even less effective than outright complaining or bragging.\n\nThis seems to me the most likely effect of anti-endorsements as well. They display faux outrage and promise brave perseverance in the face of criticisms that are often exaggeratedly portrayed as attacks. Anti-endorsements also openly borrow prestige from the critics they trash as enemies. They are assaults dressed up as victimhood.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhether I agree with the political messenger, anti-endorsements leave me stone cold, and less likely to support a politician. But hey, maybe that\u2019s just me. What about you, dear reader with high political salience? Do they work on you?\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: What do the Democratic candidates\u2019 typical voters look like?\n\nJennifer Rubin: There\u2019s a reason Biden is leading\n\nRob Stutzman: Why Elizabeth Warren is the one to watch\n\nJennifer Rubin: Can we talk \u2018electability\u2019 for a moment?\n\nJonathan Capehart: What I learned about the Democrats at a family barbecue in North Carolina\n\nMax Boot: My day at the Iowa State Fair reaffirmed a little of my battered faith in America\n\nAD", "description": "Anti-endorsements leave me stone cold, and less likely to support a politician.", "authors": ["Arthur C.
