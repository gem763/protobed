REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\n(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019319000093/a8-kseptember201991019.htm on Friday that Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger had resigned from the company's board of directors on Sept. 10 as the two companies prepare to compete head-to-head in the streaming television business.\n\nIger departed Apple\u2019s board the same day the company revealed new details about Apple TV+, a $4.99-per-month service that will launch on Nov. 1. Apple is spending billions in Hollywood to secure original programming for the service.\n\nThe monthly subscription price for Apple TV+ undercuts Disney, which earlier this year announced its own streaming service that will feature its iconic children\u2019s content and cost $6.99 per month. The Disney+ service will debut on Nov. 12.\n\nApple and Disney have long had a unique relationship among major American companies, dating back to when Apple co-founder Steve Jobs became a Disney director and major shareholder when the entertainment giant bought Pixar, the digital animation studio majority owned by Jobs. Iger became an Apple director shortly after Jobs\u2019 death in 2011.\n\n\u201cWhile we will greatly miss his contributions as a board member, we respect his decision and we have every expectation that our relationship with both Bob and Disney will continue far into the future,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\n\nIger said it was \u201can extraordinary privilege\u201d to have served on Apple\u2019s board for eight years.\n\n\u201cI have the utmost respect for Tim Cook, his team at Apple, and for my fellow board members,\u201d Iger said in a statement. \u201cApple is one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, known for the quality and integrity of its products and its people.\u201d", "description": "Apple Inc said https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019319000093/a8-kseptember201991019.htm on Friday that Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger had resigned from the company's board of directors on Sept. 10 as the two companies prepare to compete head-to-head in the streaming television business.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429609677&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C28Y", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
