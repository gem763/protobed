And the EU should compromise too.\"\n\nThe former premier also said Mr Johnson could not ignore the Benn Act which requires him to ask the EU for a further delay to Brexit if he cannot get a deal by October 19.\n\n\"You can't disobey the law as Prime Minister,\" he said.\n\nMr Johnson has repeatedly said that while he will abide by the law, Britain is leaving on October 31 come what may - although he has yet to explain how that can be achieved.\n\nThe Spectator political editor James Forsyth quoted a source in No 10 as saying there were \"all sorts of things\" they could do to scupper a delay.\n\nThe source was also quoted as blaming Irish premier Leo Varadkar for refusing to negotiate, and warning that if Mr Johnson's plan \"dies\" in the next few days it would not be revived\n\nRead more\n\nNo deal 'to send debt rocketing to levels not seen since 1960s'\n\n\"To marginalise the Brexit Party, we will have to fight the election on the basis of 'No more delays, get Brexit done immediately',\" the source is quoted as saying.\n\nMr Cameron however warned there was no guarantee the Conservatives would win a general election, which Mr Johnson has been pressing for.\n\n\"I fought an election in 2015 when I was told I was definitely going to lose, and I won. And I fought a referendum (on leaving the EU) and I was told I was definitely going to win, and I lost,\" he said.\n\n\"The trouble with general elections is you're asking one question, but people may easily go and vote on any number of other questions\".", "description": "David Cameron has urged Boris Johnson to make more compromises in order to secure a Brexit deal.The former Prime Minister said Mr Johnson's proposals will need to be weakened in order for an agreement to be reached, but said the EU would also need to give ground.", "authors": ["Sean Morrison"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MhvylTMZJ_GPjlimrbyU1A--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/5c0d27577b6bbf43f185bd76a31e02ce", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
