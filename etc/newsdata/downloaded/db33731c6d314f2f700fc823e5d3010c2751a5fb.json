But when intelligence officials revealed the severity of Russia\u2019s election interference with unusual detail later that year, the news media picked up on details about the C.I.A.\u2019s Kremlin sources\u2026\n\nThe informant, according to people familiar with the matter, was outside of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle, but saw him regularly and had access to high-level Kremlin decision-making \u2014 easily making the source one of the agency\u2019s most valuable assets\u2026\n\nThe decision to extract the informant was driven \u201cin part\u201d because of concerns that Mr. Trump and his administration had mishandled delicate intelligence, CNN reported. But former intelligence officials said there was no public evidence that Mr. Trump directly endangered the source, and other current American officials insisted that media scrutiny of the agency\u2019s sources alone was the impetus for the extraction.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Cia-Informant-Russia.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
