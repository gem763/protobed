The commonality is that investors either made a lot, or lost a lot, of money on shares of Beyond Meat and Tilray.\n\nLet\u2019s explore how investors could make money on those stocks. First, check out these charts.\n\nPlease click here for an annotated chart of plant-based-meat stock Beyond Meat BYND, +6.35%.\n\nSee: Beyond Meat stock falls despite earnings that show first profit in company history\n\nPlease click here for an annotated chart of marijuana stock Tilray TLRY, +2.39%. For the sake of transparency, Tilray\u2019s chart was previously published and is being republished without any changes.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 The big increases in both Beyond Meat and Tilray were the results of short squeezes, extraordinary pumps (pumps are usually followed by dumps), and the momo (momentum) crowd and mom-and-pop investors getting sucked in.\n\n\u2022 There was no sound fundamental basis for the runup in either stock.\n\n\u2022 Unfortunately as is often the case, Wall Street participated in the pumps in a big way, especially in Beyond Meat stock.\n\n\u2022 There are not many things about the stock market that I can say with certainty even after over 30 years of experience. Investors are familiar with Arora\u2019s Second Law of Investing and Trading: \u201cNobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets.\u201d\n\n\u2022 There are two things I know about the stock market with certainty. First, all short squeezes eventually end. The second: \u201cPumps\u201d without fundamental support are often followed by \u201cdumps.\u201d\n\n\u2022 In this twin certainty lies the edges that gives investors a consistent stream of profits.\n\n\u2022 The chart of Beyond Meat stock shows that when the stock was hitting its highs, Arora\u2019s call was to avoid the stock. I received a number of bullish emails on the stock comparing it to Tesla TSLA, -0.31%. Please see \u201cBeyond Meat is more like Tilray and less like Tesla.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The chart of Beyond Meat stock shows the Arora signal to short-sell the stock at an average price of $160. We give target zones and stop zones well in advance at the same time when buy signals or short sell signals are given. This way investors can plan ahead.\n\n\u2022 Beyond Meat stock chart shows that our second target zone given in advance has been reached. The low band of our target zone for Beyond Meat stock was $80. As of this writing, Beyond Meat stock has traded as low at $80.10.\n\n\u2022 As the Beyond Meat chart shows, the relative strength index (RSI) is oversold. For this reason and due to heavy short interest, Beyond Meat stock can bounce from here but is likely to eventually drift to our third target zone of $50 to $63. As full disclosure, we have taken partial profits on this down spike on Beyond Meat.\n\n\u2022 As the chart shows, Tilray experienced a similar \u201cpump and dump.\u201d The short squeeze was more pronounced.\n\n\u2022 As the Tilray chart shows, the stock was sold short as high as $280. The last tranche of Tilray stock was bought to cover at $24.

To consistently make money, you need as many edges as you can get.\n\nHere are the three edges most investors can develop after some study and experience.\n\n1. Short squeezes\n\n2. Pumps and dumps\n\n3. Momo crowd vs. smart money\n\nPlease see \u201cNetflix is now a \u2018don\u2019t touch\u2019 stock for investors\u201d and \u201cMarijuana stocks are oversold \u2014 here\u2019s how to know when to buy them.\u201d\n\nIt helps to have algorithms but they are not necessary to make money. All you need is the willingness to put in some screen time and the ability to visually recognize patterns on the charts.\n\nYou can use the two examples given above as templates. Both Beyond Meat and Tilray as well as other marijuana stocks such as Canopy Growth CGC, +0.68% and Aurora Cannabis ACB, +1.55% will continue to provide trading opportunities. Moreover, Wall Street provides an endless stream of short squeezes and pumps and dumps for investors to make money.\n\nCaution\n\nThese edges to make money apply only when fundamentals do not support stock price moves. You can make money both from the long side and from the short side. There is significantly more risk when trading from the short side; for this reason, no one should undertake a short trade without a good understanding and proper risk-control measures.\n\nOf course, in stocks with good fundamentals, it is often more profitable to take long term positions.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.
