The waiting period, during which the Transaction could not be completed, expired without the issuance of a so-called \u201csecond request\u201d by the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division (the \u201cDOJ\u201d). The Transaction is anticipated to close during the first half of 2020 and is subject to certain closing conditions, including the approval from the States of Nevada, Arizona and Utah.\n\n\u201cAt Cresco, we embrace compliance. Obtaining this milestone is indicative of the hard work Cresco and other companies in the industry have been doing to work with regulators,\u201d said Charlie Bachtell, Cresco Labs CEO and Co-founder.\n\nCharlie Bachtell added, \u201cThis transaction represents the final major piece of our targeted footprint. Upon the closing of the Transaction, Cresco will have cultivation, processing, and retail assets in strategic and culturally significant legal states representing 71% of the U.S. addressable cannabis market. The Company\u2019s focus on distribution and brand building will enable it to continue to capture solid market share in each of these key states as legal markets continue to develop.\u201d\n\nAbout Cresco Labs\n\nCresco Labs is one of the largest vertically-integrated multi-state cannabis operators in the United States.
