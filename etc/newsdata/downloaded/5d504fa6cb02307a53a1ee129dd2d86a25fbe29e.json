It\u2019s also used to remove color and impurities.\n\nThe water department says the chemical is normally removed during the filtration process, but recent maintenance to the system caused some to pass through the filters.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "That's not rose flowing from your faucet.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/AP_19226706019738_c0-360-5019-3286_s1770x1032.jpg?fc7d4c407b2d5dc0b14e3a0b231304e570fba745", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
