(It) is totally due to the fact that the US would not give up their old\u2026 attitude,\u201d the nuclear-armed North\u2019s leading negotiator Kim Myong Gil told reporters in Stockholm.\n\n\u201cThe US raised expectations and offered suggestions like flexible approach, new methods and creative solutions but they have disappointed us greatly, and dampened our enthusiasm for negotiations by bringing nothing to the negotiation table,\u201d Kim Myong Gil said.\n\nHe added that North Korea stood \u201cat the crossroads of dialogue or confrontation\u201d.\n\nKim Myong Gil\u2019s US counterpart was Stephen Biegun, Trump\u2019s special envoy.\n\nOrtagus said in a statement that \u201cthe early comments from the DPRK delegation do not reflect the content or the spirit of today\u2019s eight-and-a-half-hour discussion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe US brought creative ideas and had good discussions with its DPRK counterparts,\u201d she said, using the North\u2019s formal acronym.\n\nOrtagus said the United States \u201cpreviewed a number of new initiatives\u201d that would allow progress on the statement reached in Singapore at the first Trump-Kim summit last year.\n\nThe two leaders adopted a vaguely worded document on the \u201ccomplete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d but little progress has since been made on dismantling the North\u2019s nuclear programme.\n\n\u2013 Dialogue \u2018needed\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe two sides met at a heavily guarded venue on an island off Stockholm, several hundred metres (yards) from the North Korean embassy, an AFP correspondent said.\n\nAs the meeting got underway, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde tweeted: \u201cI am encouraged that US and (North Korean) working level delegations are currently in Sweden to hold talks\u201d.\n\nDialogue, she said, was \u201cneeded to reach denuclearisation and peaceful solution\u201d.\n\nSimilar-level talks on North Korea\u2019s nuclear disarmament were held in Stockholm in March 2018 and then in January this year.\n\nNorth Korea claimed to have entered a new phase in its defence capability with Wednesday\u2019s test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile \u2014 the most provocative since Pyongyang began dialogue with Washington in 2018.\n\nNorth Korea frequently couples diplomatic overtures with military moves as a way of maintaining pressure on negotiating partners, analysts say, and may believe this weapons system gives it added leverage.\n\nThe Pentagon said Thursday the missile seems to have been launched from a \u201csea-based platform\u201d and not a submarine.\n\nTrump has said he sees no problem with a string of short-range missile tests conducted previously by North Korea, while insisting his personal ties with the North\u2019s leader remain good.\n\n\u2013 Heavy sanctions \u2013\n\nThe United Nations Security Council is expected to hold closed-door talks early next week on the latest test, diplomats said.\n\nThose talks were requested by Britain, France and Germany, as the European powers push for the world body to keep up pressure on Pyongyang which is under heavy US and UN sanctions over its weapons program.\n\nNorth Korea is banned from ballistic missile launches by Security Council resolutions.\n\nSince the US-North Korea talks began, Russia and China have been calling for the UN to start lifting sanctions so as to create momentum towards the North\u2019s denuclearisation. But the United States has refused.\n\n\u201cThe United States and the DPRK will not overcome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula through the course of a single Saturday,\u201d Ortagus said.\n\n\u201cThese are weighty issues, and they require a strong commitment by both countries. The United States has that commitment.\u201d", "description": "Stockholm (AFP) \u2013 North Korea and the United States walked away on Saturday with opposing assessments of nuclear talks in Sweden, which Pyongyang", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/b4ab67_north-koreans-pictured-arriving-conference-centre-in-sweden-blamed-washington-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
