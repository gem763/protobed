They call their video production collective Tuk TV, which produced the 20-minute long documentary. The teens called their film Happening to Us.\n\n\"Because it is happening to us,\" said 17-year old Eriel Lugt.\n\nCarmen Kuptana is one of seven teenagers who made the documentary in Tuktoyaktuk. (Mario Di Ciccio/Radio-Canada)\n\n\"It's our culture that's being affected most by climate change \u2026 and it's our land too that's getting eroded and that's where our ancestors hunted.\"\n\nThey worked on it for most of the summer, filming their community, interviewing people like elders and hunters about the impacts of climate change, as well as federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Natan Obed, when they visited the hamlet this summer.\n\nHow the film came to be\n\nMaeva Gauthier, a University of Victoria student pursuing her PhD on engaging Arctic youth on global change, said the film came out of her research project.\n\nShe visited Tuktoyaktuk last summer and heard students' concerns about climate change. The community is seeing coastal erosion to the point that houses are at risk of slipping into the ocean and will have to be moved.\n\nGauthier said she applied for a grant that paid for film gear for the students, and to hire someone to lead the film workshop.\n\nBecause it is happening to us.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b - Eriel Lugt, teenager\n\nShe calls it \"amazing\" that the students will get to show their film on an international stage.\n\n\"They are very talented \u2026 it's almost nurturing what they know and pushing them to learn more.\"\n\nGauthier said the students aren't stopping at one film. They are already planning their next documentary on microplastics, which they hope to start filming in March.\n\nThe community is seeing coastal erosion to the point that houses are at risk of slipping into the ocean and will have to be moved. (Mario De Ciccio/Radio-Canada)\n\nGauthier said she's shown Happening to Us to some of her students in the South, who didn't realize the urgency of climate change.\n\n\"When they see that movie, it's a way for them to see something authentic, raw and very personal view.\"\n\nSo far the teens have raised about $7,000 of their $45,000 goal, so four of them can go to Chile. The summit will bring together governments, international organizations and the private sector to talk about solutions to climate change \u2014 from renewable energy to sustainable agriculture.\n\nThe teenagers say they are excited for an experience that they never thought they'd have.", "description": "The teenagers made their own 20-minute documentary on the effects climate change is having on their community.
