Consumer Reports\u2019 survey found that 85 percent of Americans have encountered an unexpected or hidden fee for a service they used in the past two years. Telecommunications providers, including cable companies, are the worse offenders when it comes to charging unexpected fees.\n\n\u201cWhat a cable company advertises to a consumer as a monthly price for services, and what the consumer actually ends up paying, can be dramatically different,\u201d the group said in the report.\n\nCompany-imposed surcharges for services like broadcast TV, regional sports and set-top box rental add 24 percent on top of the average cable bill, Consumer Reports said. The national average monthly cable bill in 2018 had a base package of $156.71, but fees brought the total average bill to $217.42.\n\nCable companies are required by law to itemize these fees on customers\u2019 bills. But Consumer Reports said the average cable bill contains more than a dozen line-item charges, creating a situation the group said is \u201cripe for consumer confusion.\u201d\n\nThese fees have also been increasing. Consumer Reports\u2019 survey found that 64 percent of respondents said they\u2019re paying more in surprise charges now than they did five years ago.\n\nFor example, one company\u2019s broadcast TV surcharge increased by 50 percent in a year. Another increased its fees for regional sports and broadcast TV by more than 600 percent over four years.\n\nIt\u2019s legal for cable companies to charge these fees as long as they disclose them. But Consumer Reports said the companies aren\u2019t all consistent. They\u2019re recommending that the government require cable companies to include all fees be included in the advertised price.\n\nConsumer Reports is also calling for more state attorneys general to enforce existing laws to police hidden fees, and they suggested that \u201cfee-exhausted consumers\u201d can always cut the cord, though they found that some hidden fees are now showing up in internet-only service packages, too.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cIt is long past time for the practice of hidden fees to end when it comes to cable companies,\u201d the group said in its report. \u201cCongress and the FCC have the power and ability to rid company-imposed fees from the marketplace.\u201d", "description": "A survey found hidden fees add hundreds of dollars for the average cable customer each year.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Streaming-TV.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
