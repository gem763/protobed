On top of that, Kay supposedly told officials that the team had been notified about the drug use at least as far back as 2017.\n\nThe team denied the reports in a statement saying, \u201cWe are shocked to hear these reports. We had no prior knowledge of Tyler or any other member of the Angels organization having abused opioids or any narcotic and continue to work with law enforcement to get answers.\u201d\n\nKay was reportedly placed on leave, and was also admitted to a facility to be treated for substance abuse.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs received his drugs from a team PR official, a report says.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Marcio-Jose-Sanchez-640x480-640x480-R-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
