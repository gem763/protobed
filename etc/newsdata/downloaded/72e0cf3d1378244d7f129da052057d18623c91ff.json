The once dense forest on either side of the road has turned to bare branches. Houses and government buildingshave been reduced to their concrete foundations. Cars and small jet planes have been left crumpled wreckages by 185 mph winds. Boats washed inland by the storm surge are planted among foliage.\n\nThe sheer brutality of Hurricane Dorian was on display to the few people travelling back towards the worst-hit areas on Grand Bahama, a thin strip of land that is home to 50,000 people.\n\nAs a lone pick-up truck slowed to navigate the smashed tarmac ahead, Shenelle Kemp called from the back: \u201cWe have no food. No water. We\u2019re abandoned here.\u201d\n\nKemp, 45, was heading back to her home town of High Rock, in the island\u2019s remote centre, an area mostly turned to rubble that had only been fully accessible since Thursday after Dorian ravaged Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands in the north of the Bahamas archipelago, which is home to about 70,000 people.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Euridice Kemp stands outside the destroyed home of her grandparents with their portrait in eastern Grand Bahama.

She was heading back to salvage what she could from a home and small business she knew had been destroyed.\n\nThe true scale of Dorian\u2019s destruction here is still unfolding.\n\nOn Friday evening, the Bahamian prime minister, Hubert Minnis, updated the death toll to 43 but acknowledged that the number was \u201cexpected to increase significantly\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the stark realities we are facing in our darkest hour,\u201d Minnis said in a statement. \u201cThe loss of life we are experiencing is catastrophic and devastating. The grief we will bear as a country begins with the families who have lost loved ones. We will meet them in this time of sorrow with open arms and walk by their sides every step of the way.\u201d\n\nOn Abaco Island, reports indicated numerous uncollected bodies had been obscured by piles of detritus, the creeping stench alerting authorities to their location. On Grand Bahama residents told the Guardian that dozens of people remained missing, some were assumed to have been swept away by the storm.\n\nIshmael Laing, a 69-year-old engineer living on the island\u2019s centre, was one of those lucky not to have his home destroyed. It sits on higher ground but was still inundated with storm water that rose to about 8ft inside.\n\nHe watched as the winds, sometimes gusting at 220 mph, ripped off the roofs of his neighbours\u2019 home \u201clike they were feathers\u201d.\n\nAnd then, as the storm surge rapidly increased, he saw it \u201croll over\u201d the home of a lifelong friend, Roswell, from across the street.\n\n\u201cHe is no more. They haven\u2019t found the body, but there was no way to survive that,\u201d he said. \u201cMy nephew, too. He died. They found him yesterday. He got carried away with the flood. His whole building was gone.\u201d\n\nIn the city of Freeport on Grand Bahama on Friday, hundreds lined up to try to leave the island as the Bahamian government vowed to evacuate every citizen who wanted to go. But there simply was not enough space on private boats to take everyone. There were similar, more severe scenes on Abaco Island where thousands were awaiting evacuation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pastor Pedyson Baillou makes his way to his destroyed home in the High Rock neighborhood in the eastern part of Grand Bahama island on Friday. Photograph: The Guardian\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get crazy soon,\u201d Serge Simon, a 39-year-old ice truck driver, told the Associated Press as he waited with his wife and two sons, five months old and four. \u201cThere\u2019s no food, no water. There are bodies in the water. People are going to start getting sick.\u201d\n\nLater in the day the airport in Freeport, previously littered with debris, opened once more, meaning more aid was likely to flow into the island.\n\nThe town turned to rubble by Hurricane Dorian \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nBut around the same time, an international petroleum company announced that an oil terminal on the island had sustained severe damage during the storm, leading to a serious spill. The Norwegian company, Equinor, said it had not determined how much oil had leaked from its 6.75m gallon crude oil tanks, but there were no indications yet it had made it to the sea.\n\nPhillip Smith, the executive director of the Bahamas Feeding Network, fronted efforts to deliver 20,000 meals to those most in need in Freeport. The aid had been provided by the cruise line giant Royal Caribbean earlier in the day. At present, he said, no aid had been provided directly by the government of the Bahamas, although assistance was being given by its National Emergency Management Agency (Nema).\n\nSmith was aware of the challenges he faced in getting to the more remote parts of the island, cut off for days due to treacherous weather and impassable roads.\n\n\u201cJust going into the communities here is tough. Seeing kids who haven\u2019t had a drink of water in quite a while, it\u2019s a confronting thing,\u201d he said.", "description": "As aid agencies struggle to reach devastated areas, some residents take recovery efforts into their own hands", "authors": ["Oliver Laughland"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3123432cb36b4c230f3489b5241b2e531148a554/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0617219fcd4a85c9c5d2ba4d7bdcdaba", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
