(Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\n'Absolutely nuts': Squirrels stash more than 200 walnuts, grass under hood of woman's car\n\nTwo Ashland County Sheriff\u2019s deputies unsuccessfully tried to coax the goat, named Big Boy, out of the home with carrots, a dog bone and grass. They eventually grabbed him by the horns and dragged him outside where they secured him in a dog cage.\n\nKeathley put a message out for a missing goat on a community Facebook page and received a reply with the owner\u2019s name and number. The apologetic owner arrived that evening and, with Keathley\u2019s husband\u2019s help, loaded him onto a livestock trailer for his ride home.\n\nThe Keathleys learned their home insurance policy covers damage from bears and deer but not goats. She said she\u2019s been in touch with the company. Despite applications of carpet deodorant and urine neutralizer, she said the odor from Big Boy\u2019s urine still lingers.\n\nAsked about her newfound fame, Keithley said: \u201cThere\u2019s all these awful stories in the world, people need this.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/09/goat-breaks-into-home-sullivan-township-ohio/3918249002/", "description": "\"Big Boy\" the goat gave the Keathley family's 18-year-old son quite a surprise when he got home from school.", "authors": ["Mark Gillispie", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
