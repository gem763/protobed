The Trump administration has yet to nominate a permanent director of the bureau.\n\nPendley was appointed to the role in July 2019, and immediately set off a firestorm of criticism for his past statements opposing the \"tyranny\" of federally owned public land and advocating for selling it off.\n\nPendley ran the conservative Mountain States Legal Foundation, which calls itself a \"public interest legal foundation dedicated to individual liberty, the right to own and use property, limited and ethical government and free enterprise system.\" He announced last month that he has recused himself from projects involving any of the dozens of former clients he worked with at the organization.\n\nRead more: These 10 young activists are trying to move the needle on climate change, gun control, and other global issues\n\nIn response to KFile's reporting on Tuesday, Pendley accused the network of \"cherrypicking\" out-of-context statements.\n\n\"As someone in the public arena for nearly four decades, I've given countless statements and written scores of articles on a wide variety of topics,\" Pendley told CNN. \"I'm focused now on implementing the policy priorities of the Trump administration and Secretary Bernhardt within the authorities and mission given this agency by Congress. My personal views are irrelevant in this context.\"\n\nBut much of his public remarks and writings are available online, including a 1992 speech to the Washington-based conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, in which he accused the media of inventing the so-called \"ozone hole\" \u2014 a layer of protective ozone that scientists documented as rapidly thinning beginning in the 1980s.\n\n\"Despite the total absence of credible scientific evidence, the media is convinced and is attempting to convince us that we have global warming, an Ozone hole and acid rain and that it is all man's fault,\" he said.", "description": "William Perry Pendley of the Bureau of Land Management has made controversial comments in the past, and once compared undocumented immigrants to cancer.", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9d64fa122bd553692bc4e3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
