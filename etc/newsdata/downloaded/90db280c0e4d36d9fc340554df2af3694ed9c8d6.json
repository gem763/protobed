It could happen.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival on Sept. 28 in Austin. (Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman/AP)\n\nWhat happens when a Democratic speaker of the House \u2014 third in line to the presidency, according to the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 \u2014 is suddenly thrust into the Oval Office, succeeding a Republican president and vice president who resign, embroiled in scandal?\n\nSuch a scenario is attracting attention \u2014 #PresidentPelosi was trending on social media after last week\u2019s announcement of an impeachment inquiry \u2014 even though it may seem far-fetched that President Trump and Vice President Pence would be forced from office over abuse of power related to the administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine or other misdeeds.\n\nThis was a more urgent question in the fall of 1973. On Oct. 10, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned, pleading nolo contendere to charges of tax evasion. Ten days later, President Richard M. Nixon ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox in what is widely known as the Saturday Night Massacre. As hearings began in the Senate and the House on the nomination of Agnew\u2019s successor, Gerald Ford, questions swirled about the possibility that Democratic House Speaker Carl Albert (D-Okla.) might assume the presidency.\n\nSo real was the possibility that Ted Sorensen, a speechwriter and close adviser to President John F. Kennedy, wrote a secret 19-page memorandum to Albert, offering recommendations for what to do and what to say in the event that Nixon resigned before Ford could be confirmed and Albert suddenly found himself sitting in the Oval Office. Although long forgotten, the memo is timely in this chaotic political moment, when a Pelosi presidency, however improbable, is not impossible. It reminds us that our faith in representative self-governance may yet be salvaged.\n\nWith the country facing uncharted territory \u2014 the only impeachment in American history had come more than a century before \u2014 Sorensen, who knew and liked Albert from White House breakfasts with congressional leaders during the Kennedy administration, wrote to the speaker nine days after the Saturday Night Massacre to alert him that \u201cwhether you wish it or not, you could become President at any time.\u201d\n\nNixon\u2019s \u201csudden resignation \u2026 will always be a possibility,\u201d he wrote, advising Albert to devote serious consideration (albeit silently) to a potential presidency.\n\nAlbert agreed, asking Sorensen, then a lawyer in private practice, to send him \u201ca rough draft\u201d of a contingency plan. Sorensen was no stranger to presidential transitions. He helped President-elect Kennedy staff the New Frontier in 1961 and endured the abrupt transition in 1963 after Kennedy\u2019s assassination. For decades after leaving the White House, Sorensen would be called upon to offer guidance to presidential hopefuls looking for a strong start should they capture the White House.\n\nBut the memo Sorensen wrote to Albert on Nov. 8, 1973, was unlike any other he had drafted \u2014 and one he could not have foreseen would resonate more than 45 years later. Sorensen was acutely aware of the potential political fallout if word of the memo got out, and he urged Albert to keep its existence a secret. \u201cIf discovered,\u201d Sorensen noted, the memo \u201cmight be misinterpreted as evidence of an improper motivation on your part for the President\u2019s ouster.\u201d Such delicate sensibilities seem long gone and unlikely to return in a world where political motives are almost assumed.\n\nTo help inoculate the speaker against such charges, Sorensen advised Albert to state unequivocally upon entering the Oval Office, \u201cI shall not be a candidate for the presidency in 1976 or at any other time.\u201d He also advised Albert to commit to building \u201ca nonpartisan administration of national reconciliation and unity\u201d filled with \u201cthe best men and women in the country available for the job, regardless of party.\u201d\n\nSorensen preemptively raised a question he knew a President Albert would probably face: Should Albert, a Democrat, step aside in favor of a Republican vice president once he was confirmed? No, Sorensen argued. \u201cThat would only heighten the impression of political instability in our government. You are the legitimately chosen successor selected by our most representative body under a long-standing plan adopted by the Legislative Branch.\u201d This faith in the lawful and orderly transition of power is one we ought to remember as the country confronts a commander in chief who may be unwilling to step aside, even after a defeat at the polls.\n\nMost of the memo, however, contained practical recommendations for what to do on Day One and those immediately following it \u2014 nuts-and-bolts concerns such as where and when Albert should take the oath of office. Perhaps ironically for a speechwriter, Sorensen cautioned against a full-scale inaugural address, arguing instead for a short speech emphasizing Albert\u2019s claim to office and themes of national unity.\n\nAmong the top priorities Sorensen recommended for an Albert administration was preserving Nixon\u2019s files for review by the appropriate authorities. That advice pertains today, perhaps more so. Watergate was confined largely to conversations in the West Wing, but the perfidy, corruption and possible criminality of the Trump administration extend across the executive branch and the globe. Finding the files, documents and transcripts this White House has withheld from Congress and reportedly \u201clocked down\u201d will require a full-time team of forensic experts and investigators if all the damage done is to be uncovered and remedied.\n\nRemembering the crucial and largely successful efforts to project calm, strength and stability following Lyndon Johnson\u2019s ascension after Kennedy\u2019s death, Sorensen urged Albert to demonstrate to the government, the public and the world that he was on top of things by delivering an address to a joint session of Congress in his first week in office, as Johnson had to acclaim in 1963.\n\nSome of Sorensen\u2019s guidance would be out of place today: His recommendations on personnel, for example, reflect the needs of a smaller White House staff than exists in 2019. His advice on managing the press \u2014 urging Albert to hold a news conference and limit other public statements \u2014 does not account for the demands of today\u2019s voracious media environment. One list of \u201cwise men\u201d to consult includes no women or people of color, a glaring omission for Sorensen, an early champion of civil rights, and something as unwise today as it was then.\n\nAnd yet, Sorensen\u2019s memo will be an essential \u2014 if not the only \u2014 guidebook for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) should she find herself getting closer to the Oval Office. The vice president appears to be a witness, at least, to the affairs under investigation, so the prospect of the House speaker\u2019s ascension is not as remote as it seemed just a week ago. If Sorensen\u2019s advice sounds somewhat quaint, it is only because we have drifted so far off the course set by previous presidents and the Founding Fathers.\n\nNo matter who succeeds this president, or when, the Sorensen memo is a road map to restoring the dignity, integrity and basic function of the nation\u2019s highest office. The chaos created by the current occupant\u2019s heedless, indulgent and volatile leadership \u2014 if it can be considered \u201cleadership\u201d \u2014 calls for attention to the national interest and preparation to avoid the kinds of hasty, unwise judgments and actions that can result in catastrophic mistakes. Although from another time, the Sorensen memo offers sage counsel for undertaking such preparations and a plan to steady our careening country and get it back on track.", "description": "The blueprint for the situation facing Speaker Pelosi", "authors": ["Robert Atkins", "Adam P.
