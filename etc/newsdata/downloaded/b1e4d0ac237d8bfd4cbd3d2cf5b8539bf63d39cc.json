Drone footage taken by AFP in the area showed smoke rising from charcoal grey patches of smouldering earth, surrounded by pristine forest.", "description": "The number of blazes in Indonesia's rainforests has jumped sharply, satellite data shows, spreading smog across Southeast Asia and adding to concerns about the impact of increasing wildfire outbreaks worldwide on global warming.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9357/e41a7d059e414792b33964418aee1cf8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
