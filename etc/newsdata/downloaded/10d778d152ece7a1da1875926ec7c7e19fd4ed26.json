I was pretty shocked that that sort of comment would be made to someone in the same age group as the kids he was teaching.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPhillips continued: \u2018To have them have to enter a classroom where they don\u2019t feel safe, where they don\u2019t feel they can share their opinion, where they don\u2019t feel respected, we as parents have to stand up against that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaish\u2019s comment was made on a post by Mason Severson, who was asking who would be attending the climate strike event.\n\nGirl banned from school dance for wearing jumpsuit instead of dress\n\nSeverson said: \u2018My response originally was his commentary was very vile, and a lot of people carried that same thought on with it. They thought he was just very sick and demented for making that comment over such a simple post.\u2019\n\nBaish\u2019s Facebook account now appears to be inactive.\n\nThunberg has drawn both criticism and support for hitting out at world leaders for not taking climate change seriously.\n\nKeep up the great work Kellie! https://t.co/PcAnK009EW \u2014 Donald J.

I won\u2019t be held hostage by someone who just got a learner\u2019s permit. Sorry kiddo!
