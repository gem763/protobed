Uber'\" at Dobnak because last year he worked as an Uber driver while he was in the minors. Making fun of someone for making an honest living and earning some extra money while they chase their dream doesn't seem all that clever to me.\n\nPLAYOFFS CENTRAL:Get the latest on MLB\n\nIt also rubbed a lot of other people wrong:\n\nSeems like every week they find a new way to remind everyone of what a terrible fan base they are https://t.co/HRfslZwJ5L \u2014 jordan (@JordanUhl) October 5, 2019\n\nDude went from Uber to starting in the playoffs. That\u2019s called a come up if I\u2019ve ever heard of one. \u2014 Mike Sera (@Meast808) October 5, 2019\n\nThey really taunting someone for making a living smh \u2014 Goatstros (@GoatStros) October 5, 2019\n\nI'm a die-hard Yanks fan, but c'mon... Having a job that works around your passion is nothing to be ashamed of. \u2014 702 Yankee Babe (@702YankeeBabe) October 5, 2019\n\nYeah you got him good for *checks notes* struggling until he made it to the major leagues something none of them have ever even been close to doing \u2014 John O\u2019Leary (@jyatunafish) October 5, 2019\n\nStay classy, Yankees fans \u2014 \u096a\u235fOlivia\u03df\u238a|Betrayal 13\u202224\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc95 (@BeanieJedi33) October 5, 2019\n\nAs a yankees fan.
