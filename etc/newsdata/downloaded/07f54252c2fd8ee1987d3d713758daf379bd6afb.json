The 29-year-old Wright\u2019s two-wave score of 17.33 matched championship leader Filipe Toledo but the Brazilian finished second due to a higher single-wave score of 9.63.\n\nSally Fitzgibbons misses out on finals at Freshwater Pro Read more\n\nDefending world champion Gabriel Medina made it a one-two for Brazil, winning the event with an unmatched 18.86 two-wave score including a near-perfect 9.93 on his first left-hand wave of the eight-man final. The result lifts Medina to the top of the tour standings, ahead of Toledo with Wright moving up one place to seventh.\n\nWright remains the highest-ranked Australian with Julian Wilson\u2019s fifth-place on the artificial waves at Lemoore moving him up two places to ninth.\n\nIn the women\u2019s competition, a brilliant final ride by American Lakey Peterson secured her a 9.33 and victory over France\u2019s Johanne Defay. Peterson\u2019s clutch ride gave her a two-wave score of 18.03 with Defay having to settle for second on 17.60.\n\nAustralian pair Stephanie Gilmore and Sally Fitzgibbons both had to settle for a share of fifth place after missing out on the four-woman final. Peterson\u2019s fifth world championship tour event win took her above Fitzgibbons and Gilmore and into second on the championship ladder behind American Carissa Moore, who finished third.\n\nFitzgibbons has slipped to third on the rankings while seven-time world champion Gilmore is fourth.\n\nThe next event of the WSL tour is the Quiksilver and Roxy Pro events in France from October 3.", "description": "Australia\u2019s Owen Wright has cemented his spot in the World Surf League tour top 10 with a third-place finish at the Freshwater Pro event in California.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79d41a1a7d6f4d577df4d0451bacfd19fda1673d/0_641_1719_1030/master/1719.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c63aab261faf73b2471b65cd5dd262f7", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
