Market watchers will get another read on the health of the consumer Friday when retail sales data for August is released.\n\nFriday\u2019s report comes at a critical time. With tariffs threatening the U.S. consumer, and and next week\u2019s FOMC meeting, market participants will likely watch retail sales closely.\n\n\u201cAnother solid report will be taken by the Fed as a signal that consumer spending is holding up in the face of global headwinds, and that the economy is not in much need of additional policy accommodation at this time,\u201d Wells Fargo said in a note to clients last Friday. \u201cA big miss, however, would raise concerns that consumer spending cannot sufficiently offset the headwinds from slower global growth and trade uncertainty, and add urgency for the Fed to ease policy further.\u201d\n\nEconomists polled by Bloomberg expect retail sales to have risen 0.2% in August.\n\nJuly\u2019s strong retail sales data surprised investors. Economists are expecting more moderate growth in August. \u201cAfter a strong increase in July, we expect headline retail sales growth to slow to 0.2% MoM in August,\u201d Credit Suisse wrote in a note Thursday. \u201cEx auto and gas, we expect sales grew modestly at 0.2% MoM after rising an average of 0.7% in the past three months. Some of the expected slowdown is partial payback after extreme strength in online sales last month. Seasonal adjustments may not have fully adjusted for Amazon's 'prime day' sales, and a slowdown is likely after sales rose almost 3.0% in July.\u201d\n\nNo notable corporate earnings reports are scheduled for Friday.\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
