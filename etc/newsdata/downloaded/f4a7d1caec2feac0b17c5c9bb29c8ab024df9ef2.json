(CBC)\n\nTalking point: As in Ontario, the New Brunswick government had launched a campaign of stickering gas-station pumps with information about the effects of Ottawa\u2019s tax, without mentioning the included consumer rebates. But unlike Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, New Brunswick didn\u2019t launch a court challenge against the measure. Higgs was the only premier who opposed the federal carbon price to reverse course. Ontario Premier Doug Ford congratulated Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and said his government would \u201ccontinue to discuss\u201d its efforts to fight the tax as it evaluated the election result. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was due to speak later Tuesday. However, the election result led Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe to retrench on the issue, tweeting an open letter that called on Trudeau to \u201ccancel the federal carbon tax\u201d right away. The federal Liberals lost their only seat in Saskatchewan on Monday, but held onto six of 10 in New Brunswick.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
