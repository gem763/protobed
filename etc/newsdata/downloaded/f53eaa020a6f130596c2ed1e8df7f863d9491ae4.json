In the short run, of course, it\u2019s a devastating blow,\u201d said Neal Gillespie, Stevens County Economic Development director. \u201cIn the long run, I think there\u2019s a lot of value in that plant out there, and I suspect that either they will get it up and going or someone else will get it up and going.\u201d\n\nAn employee at the Huguton plant told Biomass Magazine, a trade journal, an Abengoa executive cited financial difficulties for the layoffs and added the company does not have sufficient funds to continue paying wages.\n\n\u201cWe were told layoffs were worldwide and only about 30 people remain at the corporate office in St. Louis,\u201d the employee said.\n\nThe layoffs and shutdowns mark an about-face for the Seville, Spain-based parent company. On Nov. 27, Abengoa told Platts in a statement, \u201cAbengoa\u2019s plants continue operating as normal, and at present, no stops are expected to take place.\u201d\n\nIn yet another indication of serious financial trouble, the agricultural media outlet DTN/The Progressive Farmer reported the Nebraska Ethanol Board said the Abgengoa plant in York, Nebraska, is not in operation.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, DTN reported a major corn feedstock provider to Abengoa\u2019s plants in Nebraska and Kansas said it has not been paid for corn already delivered to the plants dating back to July. The feedstock provider filed an amended lawsuit against Abengoa on Thursday.\n\nThings are moving fast as Abengoa and its subsidiaries around the world scramble in the wake of the company\u2019s announcement Nov. 25 that it filed for preliminary creditor protection, a step that could lead to the largest bankruptcy case in Spain\u2019s history.\n\nBut this is the first time that Abengoa\u2019s financial problems has directly affected its bioenergy division, adding another layer of uncertainty about the corporation.\n\n\u201cThey are a great company,\u201d Bob Dinneen, president and chief executive officer for the Renewable Fuels Association, told DTN/The Progressive Farmer. \u201cI\u2019ve got great confidence in their technology. I suspect they will right this ship. It\u2019s a multi-faceted company. I\u2019m certain they will come through this.\u201d\n\nU.S. biofuels advocates say the facility shutdowns in Kansas don\u2019t point to larger problems with the the ethanol and biofuels industry but to the specific financial problems facing Abengoa.\n\nBut Charlie Drevna, distinguished senior fellow at the Institute for Energy Research and a noted critic of the industry, disagrees.\n\n\u201cThis is just another prime example of the technology not being there, at least as a competitive commercial technology,\u201d Drevna told Watchdog.org.\n\nThe Abengoa Bioenergy facility in Hugoton produces cellulosic biofuel that uses renewable, organic and nonfood material such as switchgrass, wood chips and corn stalks.\n\nIts facility in Colwich, Kansas, has capacity to produce 25 million gallons of corn-based ethanol per year.\n\nAbengoa\u2019s bioenergy division also has U.S. facilities in Portales, New Mexico; York, Nebraska; Madison, Illinois; Mount Vernon, Indiana and Ravenna, Nebraska.\n\nAbengoa constructed the Hugoton plant with help from the U.S. Department of Energy, receiving a $132.4 million loan guarantee and a $97 million grant.\n\nEarlier this year, Chris Standlee, executive vice president of global affairs for Abengoa Bioenenergy, told Watchdog.org the loan guarantee has been paid off.\n\nThe biofuels industry relies heavily on federal mandates. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, billions of gallons of renewable fuels must be blended into the nation\u2019s gasoline supply every year.\n\nCorn-based ethanol makes up the vast majority of the fuel. Cellulosic biofuels have been trying to make up a bigger share but has not grown nearly as much as anticipated when the Renewable Fuel Standard was put in place back in 2005.\n\nEPA recently announced requirements for renewable fuel volumes for 2014 through 2016 under the RFS and called for a big bump in cellulosic biofuels:\n\nCritics such as Drevna say the federal government shouldn\u2019t be in the business of mandating fuel requirements and point to Abengoa\u2019s financial crisis to prove their point.\n\n\u201cYour heart goes out to the employees in these facilities, but how long are we going to provide jobs based on government social engineering,\u201d Drevna said in a telephone interview. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on what kind of investments Abengoa did or did not make. All I know is they\u2019re shutting down a plant in Kansas that can\u2019t even compete in a mandated market. How they can compete in a free market?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a trade journal, we don\u2019t like to hear about or report on stories like this, but it\u2019s an important development,\u201d Anna Simet, editor of Biomass Magazine, wrote Friday.\n\n\u201cA big part of it, unfortunately, is public perception. People have a problem when government money is given to projects like these, and they experience failure. We all know that. The renewables industry will never hear the end of the Solyndra debacle, no matter how much progress is made.\u201d\n\nThe Abengoa financial crisis is a major news story in Spain, with labor unions calling on the Spanish government to bail out the company. So far, the government under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has resisted, but with elections coming up later this month, the pressure is intensifying.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Abengoa\u2019s financial woes may also have an effect on two of its solar facilities in the U.S.\n\nThe company received Department of Energy loan guarantees of $1.45 billion to build the Solana solar plant in Arizona and $1.2 billion to construct the Mojave Solar Project in California.\n\nThe Department of Energy told Watchdog.org the agency doesn\u2019t disclose details on specific projects, but said the Mojave and Solana projects are in good standing and the loans are getting repaid.", "description": "OPERATIONS SUSPENDED: Crop unloading at the Abengoa Bioenergy plant in .09/02/2019 3:11:43AM EST.", "authors": ["Rob Nikolewski", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/12/abengoa-bioenergy-plant-in-hugoton-kansas-from-abengoa-annual-report.jpg"}
