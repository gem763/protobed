Many Spaniards feel his pride of place in the basilica, which is surmounted by a towering 150-metre (490ft) cross, glorifies the man and his dictatorship rather than serving to commemorate the 500,000 people who died during the Spanish civil war.\n\nAfter a lengthy and tortuous legal battle, Spain\u2019s socialist government finally got permission for the exhumation from the country\u2019s supreme court at the end of September. The Valley of the Fallen has been closed to the public since 12 October and heavy machinery for the exhumation is already on site.\n\nIn a statement, the acting government of the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the operation would take place at 10.30am on Thursday.\n\n\u201cFollowing the exhumation, the remains will be transferred to the mausoleum in Mingorrubio cemetery where his widow, Carmen Polo, is buried,\u201d it said. \u201cBoth the exhumation and the reinterment will be carried out in privacy and in the presence of the family.\u201d\n\nThe government said it had decided to move the dictator\u2019s remains as they could no longer \u201cremain in a public mausoleum that exalts his figure\u201d, adding that the removal would \u201csymbolically close the circle of Spanish democracy\u201d.\n\nThe exhumation, long a key aim of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s party, comes as Spain prepares for its fourth general election in as many years on 10 November, and amid continuing protests in Catalonia.\n\nThe north-eastern region has been convulsed by violent unrest over the past week after the supreme court jailed nine separatist leaders for sedition over their roles in a failed bid for independence two years ago. The violence has left two people in a critical condition, hundreds more injured and has cost more than \u20ac2m (\u00a31.7m).\n\nS\u00e1nchez was due to travel to Barcelona on Monday to meet some of the police officers injured in the past week, but will not meet the pro-independence regional president, Quim Torra.\n\nS\u00e1nchez has accused Torra of failing to properly condemn the violence by a minority of violent protesters, and of ignoring the wishes of the majority of Catalans who oppose independence.\n\nTorra has threatened to hold another unilateral independence referendum in retaliation for the imprisonment of the nine separatists.", "description": "Dictator\u2019s remains will be reinterred in mausoleum near Madrid with those of his widow", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7967a52ecbfd5e1548d0ed560f43bddee6ac246b/0_72_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=874ce18a4422a7be3156ea28f6b7d7c7", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
