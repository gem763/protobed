As they tore into each other, the two Republicans were each claiming to represent Mr. Trump\u2019s position even as both were essentially trying to influence it. Mr. Paul appealed to Mr. Trump\u2019s disdain for overseas wars, while Ms. Cheney argued that \u201cAmerica First\u201d meant an assertive role in the world.\n\nWhile once a harsh critic when they competed for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Mr. Graham has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken supporters. The header photograph on his Twitter account shows him being acknowledged by the president at one of his \u201cKeep America Great\u201d campaign rallies. But Mr. Graham has used his links to Mr. Trump to stiffen his approach to national security.\n\nHe spoke out on Tuesday after Vice President Mike Pence briefed Senate Republicans on the Saudi attacks, a presentation that Mr. Graham said left him no doubt that Iran was the culprit.\n\n\u201cThe problems with Iran only get worse over time so it is imperative we take decisive action to deter further aggression by the Ayatollah and his henchman,\u201d Mr. Graham tweeted.", "description": "The president was responding on Tuesday night to a series of tweets by Senator Lindsey Graham, who has long been one of the more hawkish members of the Republican conference.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/us/politics/17dc-trump1/17dc-trump1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
