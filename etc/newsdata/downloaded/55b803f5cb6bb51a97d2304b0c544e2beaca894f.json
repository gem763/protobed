Modi will stop it and bring it to your households,\u201d the PM promised during a rally at Charkhi Dadri in Haryana on Tuesday.\n\nThis water belongs to farmers of Haryana, Rajasthan and the country and we will get it.\n\n\u201cWork towards realization of this has been started and I am committed towards it. Modi will fight your battle,\u201d he continued.\n\nAlso on rt.com Weaponized water: India threatens to divert 3 rivers away from Pakistan\n\nIndia and Pakistan share the waters of six rivers that flow through both nations under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, which has remained unbroken even through three wars. Under the treaty, India controls the waters of the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, while Pakistan controls the Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum rivers. However, an estimated 5 percent of India's unutilized water share flows to downstream Pakistani territory.\n\nIn the meantime, many of India\u2019s largest cities are running out of water, thanks to years of below-average rainfall from a weakening monsoon season. At least 21 cities, including the capital of New Delhi, may run out of groundwater as early as 2020, leaving some 100 million people in dire straits.\n\nModi\u2019s speech was not the first time his government has threatened to divert leftover water from its rivers. Then-Union Water Minister Nitin Gadkari warned Pakistan in February that it would \u201cdivert water from Eastern rivers and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab\u201d after a suicide bomb attack that killed 40 Indian soldiers in Pulwama. His counterpart in Islamabad accused New Delhi of \u201cwarmongering\u201d and boasted of the strength of Pakistan\u2019s army capable of dealing with any threat.\n\nAlso on rt.com Quarter of world\u2019s population suffers \u2018extreme water stress\u2019, India overshadows the list\n\nLike this story?
