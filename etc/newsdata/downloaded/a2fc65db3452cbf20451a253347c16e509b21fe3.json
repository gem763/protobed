She already had a black jumpsuit that she thought would be perfect. So she decided to dress it up with rhinestone shoes, a necklace, and a new hairstyle and wear it to the dance.\n\nBut when she arrived to the dance, which was for home-schooled students in Tampa Bay, Florida, the event planner stopped her before she even entered.\n\nDarcy, who paid $50 for the ticket to the dance, told Fox 8: \u2018The first moment (the event planner) sees my pants, she completely dismisses me.\u2019 My friends are kind of in disbelief too, and they\u2019re like, \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d\u2018\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nShe called her mother, Melissa, who was shocked to learn that her daughter was not allowed into the dance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMelissa Krueger said: \u2018I knew the dress code, but it didn\u2019t occur to me that it was going to be a problem,\u2019 adding that she knew the dress code did not allow pants, but she assumed the emphasis to assure \u2018coverage of all the lady bits.\u2019\n\nWoman shot by Labrador puppy as she sat in a car\n\nThe event organizer, Stephanie Voth, sent CNN a dress code that said the requirement was \u2018semi-formal dresses for young ladies.\u2019\n\nStrapless, knee-length, and two piece dresses were all allowed and some attendees were wearing outfits that pushed the conservative dress code, Melissa Krueger said, hitting out at the event for forcing girls to wear dresses.\n\n\u2018We weren\u2019t trying to bend the rules or break them,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018The bigger question is, why can\u2019t a girl wear something other than a dress code?
