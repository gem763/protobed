The underlying S&P 500 gained 0.1% on Friday. The U.S. stock market will be closed on Monday for Labor Day.\n\n\u201cThe fact that those tariffs would be effective during the weekend was already expected, and it\u2019s not news,\u201d Lee Jae-mahn, strategist at Hana Financial Investment, said by phone from Seoul. \u201cStill, U.S. stocks can be hit by this, considering the levels of its equity indexes are much higher than other markets. Markets like Asia won\u2019t be that affected as they are already very battered.\u201d\n\nThe 15% U.S. duty hit Chinese consumer goods ranging from footwear and apparel to home textiles and certain technology products like the Apple Watch. A separate batch of about $160 billion in Chinese goods -- including laptops and cellphones -- will be hit with 15% tariffs on Dec. 15.\n\nChina\u2019s retaliation took effect as of 12:01 p.m. Sunday in Beijing, with higher tariffs being rolled out in stages on a total of about $75 billion of U.S. goods.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Naoto Hosoda in Tokyo at nhosoda@bloomberg.net;Heejin Kim in Seoul at hkim579@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lianting Tu at ltu4@bloomberg.net, Kurt Schussler\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock index futures tumbled in Asia on Monday after the Trump administration slapped tariffs on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports on Sunday.S&P 500 Index futures expiring in September slid as much as 1.1%, before paring loss to 0.6% as of 7:30 a.m. in Tokyo, while contracts", "authors": ["Naoto Hosoda", "Heejin Kim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Nv9EPqcaxohTwDQw8gC1cA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/98a3320f38867b71682c74aed1f4a1d7"}
