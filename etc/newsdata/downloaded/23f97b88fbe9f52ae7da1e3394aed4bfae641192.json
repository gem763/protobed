To sweeten the supposed deal \u2014 unlike the original \u2014 this Blade 15 comes with two storage drives (instead of one) and an Ethernet port. Sounds like a good deal, no?\n\nIf you follow Razer\u2019s marketing, you\u2019d think this base model is just as powerful as the original, high-end Blade 15 with just a few hardware tweaks in exchange for the lower price. But that\u2019s not exactly true. Razer downgraded the screen\u2019s refresh rate, keyboard, battery, cooling, thickness, and even the speed of the SSD. Keep in mind, these were all defining characteristics of the original Blade 15 experience that were either removed or are completely different.\n\nHaving lower-end specs doesn\u2019t make the Blade 15 a terrible laptop to use, but it also raises the question: Can this laptop be called a \u201creal Blade 15\u201d? It\u2019s capable of the same tasks, has a more generous selection of ports, and is even lighter than the original. But Razer\u2019s compromises mean it may no longer be the laptop you\u2019re looking for.\n\nI\u2019ll explain why in detail, but you should also read my original $2,600 Blade 15 review so you get a better idea of what you might be missing in comparison.\n\nOur review of Razer Blade 15 (Dual Storage) Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Extra hard drive for storing games and media\n\nNew Ethernet port\n\nSlightly lighter than original Bad Stuff Noticeably thicker chassis\n\nGets unreasonably warm\n\nNoisy fans randomly spin up, even when idle\n\nSlower boot times with $1,600 config due to slow SSD\n\nWorse battery life during intensive use makes it less portable Buy for $1,599.00 from Razer USA\n\nThe most important thing you\u2019ll see in the spec sheet above: the base model\u2019s gaming performance isn\u2019t $1,000 worse than the original Blade\u2019s.\n\nYou can still play games at max settings, 1080p / 60 fps\n\nThe base Blade 15\u2019s GPU tops out at a GeForce GTX 1060 Max-Q, which, yes, is considerably less powerful than the GTX 1070 offered in pricier Blade 15 models. But you can still play a game like Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 at max settings and lock your frame rate to 60 fps. PC games that perform similarly include League of Legends, Overwatch, Destiny 2: Forsaken, and Rainbow Six: Siege. However, more intensive titles like Arma 3 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider \u2014 which the original Blade 15 could run better \u2014 force you to take the graphics settings down a notch or two to reach the 60 fps goal.\n\nFor some extra oomph, I used Razer Synapse \u2014 the Blade 15\u2019s system management software that allows you to overclock your GPU \u2014 to eke out an extra 10-15 fps in high-intensity games like R6: Siege. The boost comes in handy sometimes, but hearing the fans run at full blast, plus the excess heat, forces me not to use it frequently.\n\nWith that, I\u2019d say the base Blade 15 passes a basic gaming performance test, despite having the least powerful GPU in Razer\u2019s lineup. But that\u2019s true of even cheaper laptops with a GTX 1060, too, which you can find as low as $1,199. Now for the rest.\n\nThe base Blade 15 shares the same heat issues as the high-end Blade. Despite lower-end specs, more vertical space inside the chassis, and a different cooling system, the Blade 15 is just as annoyingly hot as the original. This is weird and not the first time Razer has had this issue in their machines; this was my primary gripe with the original Blade 15.\n\nThe base model is still loud and hot to touch\n\nRazer should have seized the opportunity to give the base model a leg up over the more expensive, vapor chamber-equipped Blade 15. Yet for some reason, the company didn\u2019t really do anything in the months since to address it. That\u2019s a deal-breaker for me, especially when it comes to preserving the internal health of the laptop over time. On the $2,600 system, I figured it was a first-gen fluke, but for this follow-up, it\u2019s not just a problem. Heat plus the added noise makes the base Blade 15 less desirable.\n\nDespite the heat above the keyboard, the palm rest stays cool (just like it did on the original Blade 15). But move your hand anywhere above the function row or toward the exhausts and you\u2019ll feel the heat. This isn\u2019t always the case; it normally occurs when playing games.\n\nRazer needs to take cooling more seriously\n\nWorse, unlike the higher-end Blade 15, the fans can spin up even if you just leave the laptop sitting on a table with a blank Windows desktop, not a single app in sight. This is not okay. They get even louder when you\u2019re running games or a few apps. At the cafe, in the office, people sitting next to me began to notice.\n\nAt the cost of making the Blade 15 even warmer \u2014 if you dare \u2014 you can manually control fan speeds via the Synapse app. But let\u2019s be real: you shouldn\u2019t have to micromanage the fans of a $1,600 machine.\n\nAnd in many ways, admittedly ones I could live with, this $1,600 laptop just doesn\u2019t feel like the same premium machine. Lifting the Blade 15\u2019s lid, I noticed that it has less stability compared to the original Blade. It\u2019s not wobbly but it\u2019s less stable than before; you can feel the mechanism turning over. The less fluid range of motion reflects the hinge design changing entirely to make room for the cooling system\u2019s exhausts. One bonus: the display lid is thinner than before.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a less premium experience\n\nThe lack of quality control doesn\u2019t end there. While they work fine, some of the ports are slightly misaligned on my review unit. And while this isn\u2019t a quality issue, the base Blade\u2019s thicker rubber feet could make it more difficult to slide into some backpacks because of the extra friction.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. There\u2019s noticeably slower boot and wake from standby speeds on the base Blade 15. Unfortunately, Razer will happily sell you a slower SATA III SSD (solid state drive) in the base 128GB / 1TB mode, instead of a faster NVMe model. Unless you\u2019re willing to upgrade to the $1,799, 256GB NVMe SSD / 2TB storage configuration or upgrade one (or both) of the drives yourself, you\u2019ll be stuck with a slower SSD. Thankfully, you can switch the drives out by unscrewing the bottom plate\u2019s ten Torx screws.\n\nOf course, you also don\u2019t get the same buttery-smooth 144Hz screen \u2014 admittedly, it\u2019s an upgrade \u2014 as the pricier Blade 15. Even so, I noticed the difference playing games and even just moving the cursor around Windows. But, the base Blade 15\u2019s screen comes factory-calibrated which is always appreciated.\n\nOn the bright side, the function key row is backlit this time, making it easier to turn up the screen brightness in the dark. Even though the typing experience hasn\u2019t gotten worse (or any better; the keycaps are still tiny), the keyboard isn\u2019t quite the same: you\u2019ll no longer be able to stare at dazzling light shows while you type. Razer\u2019s subtly downgraded the Chroma keyboard, switching from individually backlit LEDs (a light under each key) to single-zone lighting (one light source for the whole keyboard).\n\nThere are a couple things about the base Blade 15 that haven\u2019t changed or been watered down for the sake of being cost-effective. The speakers still sound great and are some of the best I\u2019ve heard on a gaming laptop. The glass Windows Precision touchpad \u2014 also one of the best I\u2019ve used in a gaming laptop this year \u2014 returns to the base model. Like the speakers, the touchpad is a spitting image of the original Blade 15\u2019s, which brought me a sigh of relief.\n\nThe keyboard and touchpad are fine \u2014 battery, not so much\n\nBattery life is\u2026 complicated on this model. Using the base Blade 15\u2019s battery conservatively (backlighting off, lower performance modes, etc.) I usually got the same four to five hours of battery life browsing the web, watching the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina on Netflix, browsing the web with Chrome, and spending a while in Google Docs. Not bad, considering Razer chopped off a chunk of the battery capacity; it\u2019s just 65Wh now.\n\nBut the smaller battery does change how I look at this Blade 15 when it\u2019s away from a wall outlet. I found the higher-end Blade 15 gave me an extra 30-60 minutes, using the larger 80Wh pack, for the tasks you\u2019d actually perform on a powerful thin-and-light laptop, like photo and video editing. On the base model, I ended up taking the charger with me everywhere, or even using apps that I know don\u2019t drain the battery as quickly.\n\nMost of what I\u2019ve experienced (and enjoyed) about the base Blade 15 exists in other Max-Q laptops; you don\u2019t need to spend $1,599 to have this sort of performance. Still, there\u2019s a hole in the market for a laptop that has great build quality and solid gaming performance that isn\u2019t over $2,000. I\u2019ve been testing as many Max-Q gaming laptops as I can get my hands on and I haven\u2019t seen that combination yet \u2014 typically you have to deal with build quality or a heavy chassis if you buy a sub-$1,500 gaming laptop.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend the base model\n\nStill, more affordable thin-and-light gaming laptops from OEMs like Asus and Dell / Alienware are also on the way. For example, the upcoming Alienware m15 starts at just $1,379 with the same Core i7 chip and GTX 1060 graphics, leaving you more money for upgrades. (Though Alienware doesn\u2019t offer as much RAM or an SSD at that price.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend the base Razer Blade 15. There\u2019s just too much about the user experience that\u2019s been watered down to the point where it doesn\u2019t feel like a trailblazing thin-and-light performance laptop, like the higher-end Blade 15 is. Razer\u2019s attempt to pass it off as being worthy of the same praise as the original is slightly misleading.\n\nRazer might have stripped away everything I enjoyed most about the original Blade 15, but they didn\u2019t take away its ability to play games on high settings at desirable frame rates. I\u2019d wait for another manufacturer to attempt what Razer hasn\u2019t quite done here... and hopefully do it better.\n\nCorrection: We originally stated that the upgraded version of the dual-storage model started at $1,899, that the new Blade 15\u2019s battery capacity had been reduced to 60Wh, and that Razer had longer than we had thought to improve the Blade\u2019s cooling system. That upgraded model actually costs $1,799 and the battery capacity of these models has only been reduced to 65Wh. We regret the errors.", "description": "Razer\u2019s marketing and presentation of the Blade 15 dual storage model make it appear that it\u2019s every bit as impressive as the original Blade 15. But the experience is far from the laptop that I tested earlier this year. It also proves that other OEMs need to step up their Max-Q offerings to better challenge Razer.", "authors": ["Stefan Etienne", "Nov", "Photography Amelia Holowaty Krales", "The Verge"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tINhbaNq1rPVDBrxxWCMFkvp8RQ=/0x243:2040x1311/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13359609/akrales_181030_3044_0021.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-08"}
