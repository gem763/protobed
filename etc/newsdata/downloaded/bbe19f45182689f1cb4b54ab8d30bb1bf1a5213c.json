In fact, many prospective home buyers, particularly first-timers, find it hard to overcome this challenge without the kindness of loved ones.\n\nAmong recent home buyers age 28 and younger (who are more likely to be first-time home buyers), 28% got down payment help from a relative or friend, according to a 2019 report from the National Association of Realtors. With home buyers ages 29 to 38, 21% relied on down payment gifts.\n\nBut turning on the family money faucet isn\u2019t an option for everyone. And not all home buyers have friends with spare cash to contribute. That\u2019s OK; you can help yourself buy a house. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. Coddle your credit score\n\nA higher credit score is the key that unlocks low-down-payment mortgage options, down payment assistance programs (more about those below), and attractive mortgage interest rates. Credit scores aren\u2019t based on how much money you make, but how you manage the money and debts you have.\n\nAlso see: Mortgage rates remain near recent lows \u2014 why that may not be enough to push more people to buy homes\n\nHow to do it: Check your credit report often and fix any errors, keep your credit card balances low and pay them off when you can, and avoid late bill payments like the plague.\n\n2. Seek out low-down-payment loans\n\nMany people think you need a 20% down payment to buy a house \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong. Qualified buyers can get a conventional loan with a down payment as low as 3%, an FHA loan with 3.5% down, or VA and USDA loans with no down payment at all. Lower down payment requirements can reduce the amount of time needed to gather sufficient funds, which means you may be closer to your housewarming party than you think.\n\nHow to do it: Contact lenders that specialize in low- and no-down-payment mortgages, to get a list of qualification requirements. If you\u2019re not ready now, ask what you can do to get ready.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Realtor\u2019s property listing blew up on Zillow, and you\u2019ll \u2018Scream\u2019 when you see why\n\n3. Take advantage of down payment assistance\n\nNearly every state offers a down payment assistance program for first-time home buyers. Some city and county governments offer assistance as well. These programs may provide grants (read: free money), as well as zero-interest forgivable or deferred-payment loans you can use as a down payment. These programs often have income limits and credit score requirements, and they may require you to complete a home buyer education class.\n\nHow to do it: Investigate first-time home buyer programs in your state. Read over the eligibility requirements for down payment assistance. If you have questions, talk to a participating lender or contact the agency directly.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Turning on the family money faucet isn\u2019t an option for everyone.
