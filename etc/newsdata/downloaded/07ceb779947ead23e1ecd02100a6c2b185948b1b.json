We\u2019re doing well. I would much prefer a big deal and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nSeparately, the US said it was blacklisting 28 Chinese entities it accuses of being implicated in rights violations and abuses targeting Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region. The move bars them from buying US products.\n\nThe trade meeting comes just over a week before a new round of punitive tariffs is due to be imposed on China.\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 1100 GMT \u2013\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2233 from $1.2293 at 2100 GMT\n\nEuro/pound: UP at 89.88 pence from 89.25 pence\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.0995 from $1.0971\n\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 106.93 yen from 107.26 yen\n\nLondon \u2013 FTSE 100: DOWN 0.2 percent at 7,187.41 points\n\nParis \u2013 CAC 40: DOWN 0.9 percent at 5,472.81\n\nFrankfurt \u2013 DAX 30: DOWN 1.0 percent at 11,980.40\n\nEURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.9 percent at 3,440.17\n\nTokyo \u2013 Nikkei 225: UP 1.0 percent at 21,587.78 (close)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Hang Seng: UP 0.3 percent at 25,893.40 (close)\n\nShanghai \u2013 Composite: UP 0.3 percent at 2,913.67 (close)\n\nNew York \u2013 Dow: DOWN 0.4 percent at 26,478.02 (close)\n\nBrent North Sea crude: DOWN 0.5 percent at $58.09 per barrel\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 0.6 percent at $52.41 per barrel\n\nburs-rfj/bcp/bmm", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 The British pound dived Tuesday after German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly warned that a Brexit deal was \u201coverwhelmingly", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/a10b2b_british-pound-tumbled-german-chancellor-angela-merkel-was-reported-as-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
