The Nationals will host Game 4 on Tuesday for a chance to be in the first team from Washington to make the World Series since the Senators in 1933.\n\nAnd Kendrick helped them get there, as he smashed doubles in three straight at-bats and drove in three runs Monday.\n\nThe native of Florida became the 16th player in the postseason to record three doubles in a single game and the second to do so at the age of 36 or older.\n\n\u201cHe is the greatest, ever,\u201d Washington third baseman Anthony Rendon said. \u201cYou see the man \u2014 he is still doing it. He is built like a freakin\u2019 cinder block. He is strong. He does damage; he knows how to hit.\u201d\n\nRendon joked that when he\u2019s 36, unlike Kendrick, he\u2019ll be sitting on the couch.\n\n\u201cHe is probably going to play another 20 years,\u201d Rendon said.\n\nThat would be 21 years too many for the Cardinals, who have just two runs in the series while Kendrick is batting .417 against them. He had four RBIs in Game 5 against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS, with his grand slam coming in the 10th inning.\n\n\u201cIf I am getting hits that is a good thing,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cIt feels better than getting outs.\u201d\n\nKendrick didn\u2019t realize the Nationals had won 15 of their last 17 games.\n\n\u201cWe are playing really good baseball,\u201d he said.\n\nRendon had two hits Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are going to ride this wave as long as we can,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
