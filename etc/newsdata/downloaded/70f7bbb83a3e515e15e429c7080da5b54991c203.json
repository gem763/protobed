Buttigieg, in contrast, is \u201ctrying to focus on choice, not infringing on people\u2019s freedom to make that decision voluntarily.\u201d\n\nIt is just the latest example of the increasingly pointed shots the Democratic candidates have been taking at each other in the lead-up to their fourth debate, especially those who are running out of time to break into the top tier.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButtigieg\u2019s critiques have been particularly notable in recent days. His political persona has generally been that of a genial Midwesterner, but lately he has sharpened his words not only against Warren (D-Mass.) and Sanders (I-Vt.), but also with former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) and others.\n\nButtigieg, 37, has posted impressive fundraising numbers but remains solidly in the second tier \u2014 and the single digits \u2014 in most polls. In staking out more moderate policy positions than Warren and Sanders, he has cast himself as a potential alternative to former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nBehind him are a slew of other candidates who also appear to be waiting for Biden to falter so they can take on the mantle of field\u2019s leading centrist. That\u2019s led to a series of sharp exchanges in advance of Tuesday\u2019s debate in Westerville, Ohio \u2014 \u2013 including from Biden. \u201cWe\u2019re not electing a planner,\u201d Biden said last week, a thinly veiled jab at Warren, who has made \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d a core refrain in her stump speeches..\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn recent weeks, Buttigieg has called a proposal by O\u2019Rourke for a mandatory buyback of AR-15 and AK-47 weapons \u201ca shiny object\u201d that would distract from other, more realistic gun law reform efforts.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who seized on gun control as a top priority after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August left 22 dead, called Buttigieg\u2019s comments \u201coffensive\u201d to gun violence victims and has repeatedly described the mayor as prioritizing political calculation over doing \u201cthe right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really hope that he and other candidates can see that if we\u2019re serious about saving the lives of our fellow Americans, then we have to be serious about the action that we want to take as president,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month. \u201cThe old way, of triangulating, poll testing, focus-group-driving your way to an answer just is not going to work for America.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButtigeig brushed off the criticism in an interview released Monday with host Peter Hamby of the Snapchat series \u201cGood Luck America.\n\n\u201cI get it \u2014 he needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,\u201d Buttigieg said of O\u2019Rourke.\n\nHe also suggested some of his rivals\u2019 ambitious plans are not politically viable. \u201cMy focus right now is on getting something done,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we should wait to have a fight over confiscation when we can win on background checks and assault weapons bans and red-flag laws right now.\u201d\n\nBut Buttigieg\u2019s use of the word \u201cconfiscation\u201d irked two other Democratic primary candidates, who accused him of using right-wing talking points on guns.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCalling buyback programs \u2018confiscation\u2019 is doing the NRA\u2019s work for them, @PeteButtigieg \u2014 and they don\u2019t need our help,\u201d Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said on Twitter Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) added, \u201cLeaving more than 5 million assault weapons on the street isn\u2019t a ban, it\u2019s a Band-Aid.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke leveled another charge. \u201cPete can belittle the grass roots; he can call buybacks a \u2018shiny object.\u2019 He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people each year. Those people deserve action. I\u2019ll be fighting for them,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe \u201cgrass roots\u201d comment referred to yet another spat among the Democrats, one that arose after Warren vowed last week to eschew big-dollar donors if she is the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAD\n\nButtigieg knocked Warren\u2019s fundraising strategy as one that would be ineffective in the general election, saying the Democratic nominee needs to have \u201cthe full spectrum of support\u201d to go against someone as well-financed as President Trump.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy competitors can go with whatever strategy they like, but we\u2019re going to make sure that we have the resources to compete, because we are going up against the sitting president of the United States,\u201d Buttigieg told Hamby. \u201cHe has tremendous amounts of support and allies at his back, and we\u2019re not going to beat him with pocket change.\u201d\n\nThe candidates have occasionally targeted each other before this, including an attack by Harris on Biden on racial issues at the first debate. But the recent sniping appears to mark a new phase in a race that has largely been characterized by a unified Democratic field going after Trump.\n\nAD\n\nButtigieg\u2019s campaign said he was not leveling personal attacks, only highlighting his policy differences with others in the field.\n\nBut sometimes the attacks are fairly pointed. On health care, Buttigieg accuses Warren and Sanders of not trusting the American people to choose the right health care plans for themselves. Buttigieg\u2019s plan would create a government-run \u201cpublic option\u201d but would not abolish private insurance, allowing people to choose between the two.\n\nAD\n\nA Buttigieg campaign official also pointed to Buttigieg\u2019s high favorability ratings, as well as his progress in Iowa polls, and said they are not concerned Buttigieg\u2019s more aggressive shift will cost him support.\n\nAD\n\nWarren, who has risen steadily in the polls and now leads in some of them, has avoided responding directly to Buttigieg. Hours before the debate, she doubled down on her fundraising strategy by saying she would no longer accept contributions of more than $200 from executives at \u201cbig tech companies, big banks, private equity firms or hedge funds,\u201d a limit she had already set for fossil fuel and \u201cbig pharma\u201d executives.\n\nThe Warren campaign said the rule was retroactive and that they intend to return donations that do not meet the new guidelines.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign raised $24.6 million in the year\u2019s third quarter, just shy of the $25.3 million raised by Sanders, who is also foregoing corporate and big-dollar donations. Buttigieg raised $19.1 million in the same period.\n\nAD", "description": "Pete Buttigieg and other Democrats have been attacking each other more sharply, marking a new phase in the campaign as the fourth debate approaches.
