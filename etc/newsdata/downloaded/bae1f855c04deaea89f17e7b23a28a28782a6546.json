He has so far started every single game of the 2019 season, but there are certainly are concerns about his game. His seven interceptions are tied for sixth in the league, while his nine passing touchdowns rank 19th.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe young signal-caller was traded to the 49ers during the 2017 season after spending more than three years as Tom Brady's backup in New England. Garoppolo won two Super Bowls while in New England and is hoping to take the Niners to their first championship since 2012.", "description": "Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, who won a Super Bowl in San Francisco, heaped praise upon the team \u2014 but has concerns about one possible weakness.", "authors": ["Kelsey Driscoll"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bcdw1wM4nl370Cubcb4Euw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NDAuNDY2OTI2MDcwMDM4OQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tszL15GeUmJS8C.cpjZJqA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/3951x2590+169+146/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/146bbc30-fa85-11e9-b767-ea879adcb3ee", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
