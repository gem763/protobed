To date, Peloton ranks as the second worst performing IPO of 2019.\n\nAs for Uber and SmileDirectClub, the ride-hailing company is down 33% off its IPO listing price, while SmileDirectClub is down 36%. SmileDirectClub posted the worst debut trading performance of any unicorn \u2014 private companies valued at over $1 billion \u2014 for 2019, when it went public earlier this month.\n\nFifty-seven of about 120 companies that have gone public this year are trading below their offer price, according to Renaissance Capital and CNBC data.\n\nWeWork, meanwile, has seen its valuation plummet to below $20 billion from its initial $47 billion valuation, according to its first S-1 filing. The company delayed its IPO roadshow last week, amid valuation and management debacles.\n\nS&P Ratings downgraded the bond rating of the embattled real-estate turned \"tech\" company to B- from stable, and the company's CEO Adam Neumann was ousted by the Board. (Neumann reportedly voted to oust himself, too.)\n\n\"WeWork might have benefited [from the new SEC rule], but it's hard to know,\" David Golden, managing partner of Revolution Ventures, said in an email. \"I am confident that no firm would have been selected to lead the deal if they were advocating for a 'down round' to Softbank.\"\n\nGolden said a \"test-the-waters\" stage might have saved WeWork's IPO underwriters from succumbing to private-market hype.\n\n\"The apparent momentum was too great, and I suspect J.P. Morgan was caught up in that somewhat. It's too bad because a little 'tough love' from the underwriters may have gone a long way,\" he said.\n\nIt's important to note, though, that much of WeWork's corporate governance issues would not have been highlighted in SEC registration statements nor WeWork's prospectus to begin with, Golden added.\n\nThursday evening, the same day as Peloton's IPO, sports entertainment company Endeavor nixed its IPO hours before it was set to price shares, citing low investor demand.\n\nSome of the public-private valuation disparity comes down to structural issues in the underwriting process that could contribute to disappointing results the day of a company's public debut.\n\n\"They've got a self-inflicted problem,\" said University of Florida business professor Jay Ritter about underwriters. \"A company is more likely to award the mandate to an investment bank that talks about a high valuation. Once the issuing company's executives start hearing the high numbers, they tend to anchor on those numbers and are setting themselves up for disappointment if the underwriter tells them later on that the market is not willing to pay anywhere near that.\"\n\nBeyond the balancing act of winning the deal and managing expectations, underwriters must deal with the added hurdle that previous private market investment tends to overestimate a company's valuation, Ritter added.\n\nCompanies generally sell convertible preferred stock to private investors, which is worth more than the common stock that would eventually be sold to public investors. Plus, late-round private investors frequently get additional \"bells and whistles,\" Ritter explained.\n\nWhen a company goes through the hoops of finally filing an S-1 and hiring an underwriter, there's also incentive for the underwriter to then lower the valuation of the company after securing the deal.\n\nIf shares are in high demand on the day of the debut, hedge funds often promise the underwriter fees and commissions on future deals just in order to get in on the bargain. There's little that the issuing company can do once the opening price is set, besides walk away from the deal.\n\nAll of that, of course, hinges on an executive being receptive to lower valuations to begin with.", "description": "The rule, announced Thursday, comes on the heels of a string of lackluster IPOs.", "authors": ["Ganesh Setty"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105171380-IMG_8979.jpg?v=1525095934", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
