But ironically, it is institutions that many cryptocurrency investors have claimed to rely on to boost Bitcoin to fresh all-time highs.\n\nYet, as of now, institutions have seemingly yet to have made a large impact on the crypto markets. Industry upstart BlockFi, for instance, reported earlier this month that the metaphorical \u201ccrypto virus\u201d has only \u201cinfected 1.3% of the total private fund population\u201d as of 2019. This may be for good reasons.\n\nInstitutions Still Not in Bitcoin\n\nCryptoOracle, a community-centric industry venture capital firm, recently held a conference call with four industry venture capitalists/investors: Matthew Welsh of Castle Island Ventures, Matthew Le Merle of Blockchain Coinvestors, Eli Mizroch of Silver Castle Digital Currency Investment Group, and Travis Kling of Ikigai Asset Management.\n\nWhile these are investors from all over the world with presumably distinct theses, they all centered around similar ideas regarding institutional involvement in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Kerner, in a post mortem of the star-studded conference call, wrote:\n\n\u201cWhile all the speakers have drank the Kool-Aid, they were all measured in their responses, and aware of the challenges ahead. The consensus was that institutional investors are coming in scale, but we\u2019re still 1+ years away.\u201d\n\nThey attributed this idea to immaturity in \u201cthree key infrastructure categories\u201d: qualified custody, regulated spot ventures and futures exchanges, and robust data providers at an institutional scale.\n\nRight now, there exists institutional-grade solutions in all these three categories, yet it\u2019s not good enough according to Kerner & Co. In one of Kerner\u2019s slides, he noted that for custody, \u201ccustody clarity under SEC is needed\u201d; and for exchanges, surveillance sharing agreements and mature settlement services are needed.\n\nThey\u2019re Coming\u2026\n\nWhile institutions have yet to delve into Bitcoin at scale, there is evidence to suggest that they\u2019re getting their toes wet, so to speak.\n\nJust last week, Grayscale Investments, a leading cryptocurrency investment services provider, revealed that its products saw a record quarter, drawing in $254.9 million in three month\u2019s time. What\u2019s interesting about this statistic is that a majority of these inflows, to both the Bitcoin and altcoin funds of Grayscale, came from institutional players. A report said, in fact, that \u201ca majority of investment (84%) came from institutional investors, dominated by hedge funds.\u201d\n\nGrayscale isn\u2019t the only important platform for institutional players. Bakkt launched its Bitcoin futures in September.\n\nSpeaking with this writer, analyst PlanB, who has quickly become a leading crypto commentator, remarked that Bakkt provides liquidity to this market in that \u201cit gives investors an additional way to sell their investment, another exit.\u201d He added that this extra exit \u201ccould be a reason to buy in the first place. I never buy if I am not sure that I can sell at a reasonable market price.\u201d\n\nAnd arguably most importantly, Fidelity Investments just revealed that it has started to ramp up its crypto operations. The firm\u2019s cryptocurrency division launched late in 2018 (a year ago now) is \u201cnow engaged in a full rollout of its custody and trading services for digital assets,\u201d the report noted citing Fidelity\u2019s pro-Bitcoin CEO, Abigail Johnson. It isn\u2019t clear what group/subset is \u201celigible\u201d to use the firm\u2019s digital asset custody and trade execution products, yet Fidelity has some $2.4 trillion of assets under management.\n\nNot Needed for Bitcoin to Succeed\n\nSure, there is a large focus on institutional players, but are they really needed in this revolutionary industry? According to Kerner, not really. Per previous reports from NewsBTC, he said that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need involvement from the institutional subset to succeed, citing the fact that a majority of the asset\u2019s growth has been retail-based. Kerner even went as far as to say that the institutions will be the followers in this market, not the trailblazers.\n\nIndeed, a majority of BTC\u2019s growth from effectively zilch to $20,000 over the course of a ten-year time period was catalyzed by mom & pop investors, the cypherpunks, early adopters, venture capitalists, and other non-institutional groups.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) has long been described as a movement to phase out institutions.
