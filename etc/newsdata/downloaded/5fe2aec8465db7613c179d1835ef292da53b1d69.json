My addition is browned butter, an ingredient not so common in Southeast Asian cooking. This was one of my lola\u2019s signature dishes: She\u2019d cut the onions half-an-inch thick, sear them briefly, then add a little water to make the pan flare up, so they\u2019d get extra crisp. She would always plate it in a casserole dish, with enough pan sauce to sop up with rice. The beef fat should coat your lips, and then the citrus cuts through it. It\u2019s worth investing in good olive oil; every ingredient matters, because there are so few, and you can taste them all.\n\nFeatured in: Angela Dimayuga\u2019s 10 Essential Filipino Recipes.", "description": "Bistek is steak, but one transformed by its encounter with soy sauce and citrus My addition is browned butter, an ingredient not so common in Southeast Asian cooking This was one of my lola\u2019s signature dishes: She\u2019d cut the onions half-an-inch thick, sear them briefly, then add a little water to make the pan flare up, so they\u2019d get extra crisp", "authors": ["Angela Dimayuga", "Lidey Heuck", "Colu Henry", "Sam Sifton", "Samantha Seneviratne", "Melissa Clark", "David Tanis", "Claire Saffitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/08Filipinorex1-Bistek/merlin_160617693_711de1c8-0f49-40d6-98e3-8ecc2cdffac9-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
