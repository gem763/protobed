If a deal is agreed, EHICs should remain in operation until December 2020.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe Government has stated that it wants to keep the EHIC as part of future trade negotiations with the EU. However, only four countries have agreed to cover UK travellers if there is no deal.\n\nSpain and Belgium have agreed to continued reciprocal arrangements, and Portugal has passed a no-deal law which means that until the end of 2020, UK tourists will be able access healthcare with a valid passport.\n\nMeanwhile, Ireland will allow UK citizens access to healthcare on the current basis whether there is a deal or not.\n\nComparison website Go Compare has now issued a warning to holidaymakers on the importance of travelling with sufficient cover.\n\n\"If EHICs cease to exist, tourists will have to foot the bill for medical treatment in the countries previously covered by the scheme. If they\u2019re not insured, they\u2019ll have to find the money out of their own pocket \u2013 which would be a struggle for most people,\" explained Sally Jaques from GoCompare.\n\n\"Medical costs can quickly escalate. Last year the average insurance medical claim tipped \u00a31,300, but bills can be much, much higher. Insurers have already warned that if EHICs are withdrawn, travel insurance premiums will rise to reflect increases in the costs of medical claims.\n\n\"The disappearance of EHICs would hit people with pre-existing health conditions hardest. EHICs cover treatment of chronic or pre-existing medical conditions and consequently, if EHIC arrangements end, people may struggle to get affordable travel insurance for European travel.\"\n\nGoCompare tips on buying travel insurance\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)", "description": "While the Government has said it wants to keep the EHIC as part of future trade negotiations with the EU, only four countries have actually agreed to cover UK travellers if there is a no deal", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Getty", "Pa", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16235488.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
