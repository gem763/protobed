That is the message the Department of Education is sending with its threat to withdraw federal support for the Consortium for Middle East Studies, operated jointly by Duke University and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, if it does not alter the content of its programming.\n\nJust three months after Education Secretary Betsy Devos ordered an investigation into a conference about the politics of the Gaza Strip that the consortium had sponsored \u2013 an authoritarian threat, in and of itself \u2013 the Department of Education issued a letter demanding that the Duke-UNC consortium remake its curriculum. Or else.\n\nThe Department of Education\u2019s letter, published last Tuesday, charged that the Duke-UNC program was failing to meet its federal mandate \u2013 by focusing too much on cultural studies and topics like \u201cLove and Desire in Modern Iran\u201d and not enough on \u201cadvancing the security and economic stability of the United States\u201d. In other words, it seems the program was teaching its students about the complex and varied cultures of countries in the Middle East instead of how to dominate them.\n\nThe letter did not mention directly the conference on Gaza, during which several well-respected American, Israeli and Palestinian experts spoke. But it didn\u2019t have to. The DeVos-ordered investigation is part of the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to crack down on campus criticism of Israeli policy \u2013 a goal to which the administration made its commitment explicit when it appointed Kenneth L Marcus assistant secretary of civil rights in the Department of Education. That the investigation was followed by the threat of defunding is an indication of just how serious the Trump administration is about this goal.\n\nMarcus\u2019s confirmation was opposed by major civil rights organizations, including the NAACP and the Human Rights Campaign, as well as by the National Bar Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the National Council of Jewish Women. The reasons are manifold \u2013 for example, Marcus\u2019s opposition to affirmative action, his spotty record on disability rights, and his shaky commitment to LGBTQ equality. A letter signed by the more than 30 groups that opposed Marcus\u2019s nomination noted: \u201cMr. Marcus\u2019s attitudes and beliefs fail to demonstrate a commitment to protecting students of color from discrimination.\u201d It also observed that Marcus had, since leaving the Bush Department of Education, sought to use anti-discrimination law \u201cto chill a particular point of view, rather than address unlawful discrimination\u201d.\n\nIn the Trump era, the repression of left-wing viewpoints is free speech; federal intervention in university curriculum is academic freedom\n\nBy \u201cchill a particular point of view,\u201d what the civil rights groups\u2019 letter was referring to was Marcus\u2019s work as a professional pro-Israel operative, and, more specifically, his efforts to use civil rights law to shut down the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement (BDS) on university campuses. Marcus articulated his strategy in a 2013 op-ed for the Jerusalem Post. \u201cAt many campuses, the prospect of litigation has made a difference,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf a university shows a failure to treat initial complaints seriously, it hurts them with donors, faculty, political leaders and prospective students.\u201d\n\nPace Marcus\u2019s op-ed, the threat of litigation or the withdrawal of funds would be enough to pressure universities into clamping down on BDS and BDS-adjacent activism. But, more recently, since assuming his post at the Department of Education Marcus has attempted to take this strategy even further, pushing the government to define the BDS movement as antisemitic and designate anti-occupation and Palestine solidarity activism as violations of Jewish students\u2019 civil rights. A range of groups, from the free-speech watchdog Fire to the liberal pro-Israel lobby J Street, have warned that the conflation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism poses serious threats to campus free speech.\n\nIn the Orwellian grammar of the Trump era, though, the repression of left-wing viewpoints is free speech; federal intervention in university curriculum is academic freedom. The Department of Education threat against the Duke-UNC consortium is yet another example of the Trump administration\u2019s spectacular hypocrisy and cynicism, not to mention its clash-of-civilizations-style Islamophobia\u2014among other things, the Education Department\u2019s letter accused the Duke-UNC program of devoting disproportionate emphasis \u201con understanding the positive aspects of Islam.\u201d\n\nYet the significance, and the reasons behind, the Education Department\u2019s attack on the Duke-UNC program goes beyond just Israel-Palestine and even the politics of Middle East studies. In a Trump administration marked by unceasing staff turnover, stark policy reversals, and more general unpredictability and chaos, one of the few constants has been the president and his allies\u2019 hostility to institutions of higher education.\n\nThere is a long history of right-wing antipathy to universities, seen as breeding grounds for unpatriotic thought, cultural deviance, and liberal decadence. The Trump administration\u2019s higher policies have largely reflected this view\u2014from the appointment of right-wing, education war stalwarts such as Besty DeVos and Marcus to Trump\u2019s signing of a farcical \u201cfree speech\u201d executive order intended \u201cto defend American students and American values that have been under siege\u201d. And the UNC-Duke consortium letter was not even the sole higher-education-related punch the Trump administration landed this week. The National Labor Relations Board announced it would move to strip the right to unionize from teaching and research assistants at private universities.\n\nIndeed, when it comes to higher education, the Trump administration\u2019s approach is uncharacteristically coherent, to fight its enemies \u2013 variously conceived of as liberals, Arabs, Muslims, Palestinians, LGBTQ people, people of color, and women \u2013 by enforcing ideological constraints, amplifying conservative viewpoints, dismantling or manipulating anti-discrimination statutes and, when possible, slashing federal funding.", "description": "Trump\u2019s department of education is using the threat of defunding to achieve its political goals \u2013 to great effect", "authors": ["Joshua Leifer"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a24b5886b9142db23d78c2c6d41c04940ff6790/0_0_5130_3078/master/5130.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=45b9a98bcec3bb991136afe416f55f8e", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
