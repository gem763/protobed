The first state-wide early warning system in the nation launched today, on the 30th anniversary of the devastating Loma Prieta earthquake that killed 63 people in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe early warning system will reach people in two ways: through an app called MyShake and through the existing wireless emergency alerts that sound an alarm on cellphones for flood warnings and missing children (Amber Alerts). If all goes well, it will give people up to \u201ctens of seconds\u201d of advance notice before they might feel the ground shaking.\n\njust enough time to save lives\n\nThat\u2019s just enough time to save lives and prevent injuries, its developers say. They are eager to finally get the ball rolling after years of pushing for the political will and technological advances to make it a reality. But they\u2019re quick to note that the app that is rolling out today is still likely to face challenges ahead when it comes to expanding to a huge scale, especially during a major earthquake. And work is still underway to make it more inclusive of people who don\u2019t use smartphones or who speak different languages.\n\n\u201cWe think that there\u2019s probably more work to do in the future but if we can save even one life, then it\u2019s worth turning it on,\u201d Brian Ferguson, a spokesperson with the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, tells The Verge.\n\nThere\u2019s a 99.7 percent chance of a magnitude 6.7 or larger quake rocking California in the next 30 years. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality we live in,\u201d California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a launch event today. \u201cThe price of admission to live here is preparation.\u201d\n\n30 years ago today a portion of the Bay Bridge collapsed.\n\n\n\nToday, I\u2019m proud to stand here and announce that CA is the first state in the nation to launch an earthquake early warning app.\n\n\n\nBe prepared.

That would have been enough time for drivers to pull off the road or for people indoors to jump under a sturdy table to protect themselves from falling furniture and debris. More than half of all injuries in the Loma Prieta earthquake in the Bay Area, and disastrous 1994 Northridge earthquake outside Los Angeles, were linked to hazards like falling ceiling lights and bookshelves.\n\nThis is the most expansive earthquake early warning app to be unveiled in the US. Another app, ShakeAlertLA, came out in January, but it was only available to people within the Los Angeles area. Both apps work with the United States Geological Survey\u2019s (USGS) network of seismic sensors.\n\nHere\u2019s how the early warning system works: When an earthquake starts, it releases energy that travels through the Earth in two different ways, called primary and secondary waves. Primary waves move faster, but the average person wouldn\u2019t notice them. It\u2019s the secondary waves that people recognize as the Earth shaking.\n\neverything happens in seconds\n\nThere are about 800 sensors positioned across the state that can detect primary waves. Those sensors send data to three processing centers where computers figure out where the quake is and how strong it will be. Then apps and the wireless emergency alert system quickly push out a warning moments before people feel the destructive secondary waves. (App users will need to have location services enabled to get the alert.) The farther away someone is from the heart of the quake, the more warning time they\u2019ll get. Ideally, everything happens in well under a minute. The whole system is automated because there\u2019s just no time for humans to be involved.\n\nThe system also has to be fast so that it can crunch the data and send out a warning before those dangerous secondary waves have a chance to damage the equipment. The message delivery system is cloud-based to keep it moving in the event of an earthquake. But phones still depend on cell towers that could topple.\n\n\u201cThere is always a risk that some portion of that network will not be able to deliver the alert,\u201d says Richard Allen, director of the Berkeley Seismology Laboratory, which helped develop the new system along with the USGS, Caltech, and the California Geological Survey. \u201cOur hope is that even if the strong shaking does cause some failures within the network, that we will already have been able to push out the alert, so we will already have done our job,\u201d Allen says.\n\nUsers will get alerts through the new MyShake app if they\u2019re in an area that will experience noticeable shaking. Researchers classify how intense shaking is using something called the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, which ranks shaking intensity from lowest (one) to highest (ten). For this app, users will start getting notifications if they\u2019re in an area where the shaking is expected to hit an intensity of three or higher.\n\nThat threshold used to be higher. But developers of the new app decided to lower it after an earthquake struck outside of Los Angeles in July. Users of the LA app complained that they didn\u2019t get a notification, even though the shaking they experienced was weak.\n\nFor people without an app on their phone, the wireless emergency alerts will be sent out, but they\u2019ll only reach people who are expected to feel shaking with an intensity level of four or higher. Those alerts will be slower than the app, simply because the system was designed for other types of emergencies where mere seconds don\u2019t make such a huge difference. But they should reach a broader audience, since most modern smartphones support the Wireless Emergency Alerts system.\n\nthe next big test\n\nBerkeley\u2019s Allen says the next big test will be how this works on a scale of alerting millions of people rather than just a few thousand. It was tested earlier this week during a magnitude 4.5 quake in the Bay Area and a 4.7 quake in central California. In the first quake, the early warning system was able to get a message to phones within a median time of 2.1 seconds. Warnings about the second quake reached phones in a median of 1.6 seconds. The app will continue to improve, Allen assures users, \u201cWe built this system so that we can test it in flight.\u201d\n\nThe next wave of innovation will be in making sure that people without smartphones, who have a disability, and who speak different languages will also get alerts, according to Ferguson and Allen. To do that, the alerts could be broadcast over the radio and television in the future. And the app could soon be available in Spanish and other languages. (The ShakeAlert LA app is already available in Spanish.)\n\n\u201cWe know that oftentimes people who are differently-abled or non-English speakers are the most vulnerable during emergencies, so that development will continue apace as we move forward,\u201d says Ferguson.", "description": "Seconds before an earthquake hits anywhere in California, people nearby will now get a warning on their smartphones to duck and cover.
