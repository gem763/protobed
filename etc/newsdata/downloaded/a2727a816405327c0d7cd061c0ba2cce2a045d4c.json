Today, things are different. A new era of fine dining and celebrity chefs is turning restaurants into attractions alongside slot machines and poker tables.\n\nNearly 40 of them were in the spotlight Saturday at the Las Vegas stop of the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience. The four-hour event, hosted by MGM Resorts International at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds, was an exceptional mix of Strip and neighborhood restaurants, highlighting the best of what Sin City has to offer.\n\n\"We need all the exposure we can get,\" said Bank Atcharawan of Lamaii, a new Chinatown restaurant known for its Thai cuisine and eclectic wine list. \"For a local restaurant, it's really important.\"\n\nLas Vegas chefs heat things up\n\nThe sprawling outdoor lot on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara Avenue was transformed into a sea of white tents with chefs and their kitchen teams preparing small portions of their best dishes, much of them saut\u00e9ed or grilled on the spot. Guests were handed a glass to wash down all that food with wine samples from stations throughout the event. VIP ticket holders were allowed in an hour early and enjoyed exclusive areas, including a rooftop deck with shaded seating to help fend off the warm October sun.\n\nLamii faced the expectations of the festival head on, ready to serve at least a thousand dishes of its crab curry with gluten-free rice noodles. The recipe packed a spicy kick, but was toned down for the palette of a broad audience.\n\nA more established restaurant, Libertine Social at Mandalay Bay, took the opportunity to preview a new dish that won't debut on the regular menu for a few more weeks: a bone-in Australian Wagyu pastrami sandwich large enough to serve four-to-six people.\n\n\"When you order it at the restaurant, we're going to carve it tableside and serve it with traditional Jewish deli ingredients,\" said executive chef Jamaal Taherzadeh. \"We make our own sauerkraut, pickles, peppers, mustard and spicy horseradish sauce, just so you can appreciate the quality of the pastrami itself.\"\n\nNearly 40 restaurants served delicious dishes at the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience in Las Vegas, hosted by MGM Resorts International at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds, on Oct. 26, 2019.

Marc Vetri earned national acclaim and a James Beard award for Vetri Cucina in Philadelphia before opening a Las Vegas version of the restaurant last year at the newly renovated Palms Casino Resort.\n\n\"I'm only supposed to be here four times a year, but I'm out here every month because I like it so much,\" said Vetri about the Las Vegas dining scene. \"We love being involved in the restaurant community here.\"\n\nVetri served an earthy twist on bruschetta with chicken liver ragu and mushrooms, although he wasn't the only chef to challenge the audience. Christopher Heisinger of Le Cirque \u2014 a French restaurant at the Bellagio that not only outpaced, but outlasted the original in New York \u2014 served up a foie gras tart with autumn spices.\n\n\"We use foie gras 24/7,\" said Heisinger. \"I just wanted to represent what we are.\"\n\nOthers favored simplicity. Ambra Italian Kitchen + Bar, a new restaurant at the MGM Grand, presented a choice of meatballs with tomato sauce and ricotta or salmon crudo with pickled mustard seeds, fennel and orange.\n\n\"Keep it simple and delicious,\" said executive chef Vic Casanova about his strategy. \"Less is more.\"\n\nThe Bella Twins are charmingly not sommeliers\n\nThe stars of the event, however, were Brie and Nikki Bella \u2014 the Bella Twins of reality TV and professional wrestling fame \u2014 who met with fans during a meet-and-greet to promote their new Napa Valley wine, Belle Radici.\n\nThe Bella Twins of reality TV and professional wrestling fame hosted a meet-and-greet to promote their new Napa Valley wine, Belle Radici, at the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience in Las Vegas on Oct. 26, 2019.

They produce some of the best grapes in the industry, so that's what truly makes our wine so special.\"\n\nThe twins also led a seminar at The Cellar, a stage dedicated to all things vino and made a point to keep the atmosphere light.\n\n\"Somms are very snooty,\" said Brie. \"The Bellas like to have fun.\"\n\n\"It's Sin City,\" added Nikki. \"Vegas is a foodie spot, and people are here to relax and let loose. They're from all over the world. You don't get that in most other cities.\"\n\nSips go beyond wine\n\nIn addition to wine, the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience had its share of cocktails to sample. A VIP tent dedicated to Rums of Puerto Rico \u2014 a marketing arm of the territory's tourism initiatives \u2014 served a applewood-smoked Don Q Anejo Old Fashioned with chocolate bitters and a modified Moscow Mule, mixing aged Don Q with a strawberry and rosemary-infused simple syrup, topped off with ginger beer.\n\n\"We have anything from 3-to-8 years to 10-to-16 years, up to 20-year aged rums,\" said mixologist Marcos Echevarria. \"We want to educate people on the rums.\"\n\nCocktail from Rums of Puerto Rico at the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience in Las Vegas on Oct. 26, 2019.

Joe Johnson, executive chef of Yardbird, went the extra mile, boiling a whole 1-pound Maine lobster on the spot for his restaurant's mac n' cheese side dish.\n\n\"It's great marketing for any restaurant in general,\" said Johnson.\n\nUltimately, the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience was about restaurants large and small, coming together while mixing flavor profiles and earning new fans one bite at a time.\n\nValencian Gold restaurant makes paella at the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience in Las Vegas on Oct. 26, 2019.

We just want to spread that passion as far and wide as we can.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food-dining/2019/10/27/usa-today-wine-food-experience-heats-up-las-vegas/2455873001/", "description": "Las Vegas chefs showcased some of their best dishes alongside sips of world-class wine and spirits at the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience.", "authors": ["Rob Kachelriess", "Special To Usa Today", "Published P.M.
