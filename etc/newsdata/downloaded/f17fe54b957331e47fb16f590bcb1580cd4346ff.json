Who could forget Glenn\u2019s poetic musings on the Notre Dame? Who among us didn\u2019t shudder with terror when we couldn\u2019t tell if we were watching Glenn Close or Woody Harrelson? On Wednesday night, Glenn Close\u2019s Instagram gave the world yet another gift by featuring the actress slapping a magician across the face with no explanation whatsoever.\n\nThe video captioned \u201cFun with Derren Brown!\u201d features Glenn Close and British mentalist Derren Brown engaging in a slap-off of sorts. It begins with Glenn Close gingerly slapping Brown across the face and then - quite shockingly - Brown slapping Close right back. Don\u2019t fret because Glenn gets the last and most palpable hit before letting out what can only be described as a truly maniacal laugh. \u201cI\u2019m tough. That was really good,\u201d Glenn says as Derren Brown laughs and nods along while he massages his face. The video ends somewhat mysteriously with the phrase \u201cTo Be Continued\u2026\u201d appearing on screen with both the \u201cTo\u201d and the ellipses partially obscured.\n\nWhat forces of nature brought these two individuals together to slap each other silly? Who is sitting in the audience off-screen, laughing along as Derren Brown gets absolutely rocked by Glenn Close? Why didn\u2019t Glenn Close take the time to properly fit \u201cTo Be Continued\u2026\u201d into the final frame of her Instagram video? We may never know the answers to these questions, but we do know that we\u2019re incredibly grateful that all of this occurred. It\u2019s now clearer to us than ever that if the Academy gave out Oscars for Instagram usage Glenn would not be empty handed.", "description": "7 time Oscar nominated actress Glenn Close has a blast slapping mentalist Derren Brown across the face on her Instagram page.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/19-Glenn-Close.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
