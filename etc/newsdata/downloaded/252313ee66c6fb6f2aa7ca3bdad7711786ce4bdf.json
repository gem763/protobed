Gaffe-prone and erratic on the debate stage and out of touch with the Democratic Party\u2019s energized millennial wing, Biden, who is 76, is probably the least formidable front-runner ever. And yet, according to polls, he is still the front-runner \u2026 but for how much longer? Nuzzi follows Biden on the campaign trail and inside the war room, as Uncle Joe stumbles toward the nomination.\n\nReporting this story over the last six months, Nuzzi attended countless Biden events in a half-dozen states. Biden declined to be interviewed for the piece, which, according to Nuzzi, says something about the state of his campaign: \u201cBiden has given very few formal interviews since getting in the race, and I think it\u2019s that the campaign believes that the less he speaks without a script, the smaller the risk of him fucking up. They\u2019re afraid of their own candidate and they don\u2019t trust him.\u201d In reporting on Biden, Nuzzi says she\u2019s consistently surprised by what emerges from his events as news. Counting travel time, time spent waiting for him to come out, and time spent listening to the speakers before him, reporters can easily spend half the day waiting for Biden to speak, \u201cand then during the Q&A, or talking to reporters, he says something as an aside, or says something by mistake and then tries to correct it, and that moment \u2014 those ten seconds \u2014 will be the big news about Biden that day,\u201d says Nuzzi.\n\nThe piece also touches on Biden\u2019s relationship with Barack Obama, and the fact that Obama has not endorsed his former colleague. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but when he talks about \u2018my friend Barack,\u2019 \u2018Barack and me\u2019 ten times in one speech it\u2019s sort of like a kid saying they have a girlfriend, she just goes to another school,\u201d says Nuzzi. \u201cLike, there\u2019s a sort of pathetic quality to it. I think they will blame Obama\u2019s refusal to endorse if Biden does not secure the nomination.\u201d", "description": "New York Magazine\u2019s Washington correspondent Olivia Nuzzi on the campaign trail and inside the war room with Uncle Joe, stumbling towards the nomination.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/press/2019/10/25/Oct28-Nov10_2019_Biden.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
