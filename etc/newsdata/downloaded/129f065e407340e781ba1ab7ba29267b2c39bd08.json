You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nEarlier this year, TV presenter Rav Wilding recently opened up about being diagnosed with dyspraxia, saying he has found it \"tricky\" coping with the co-ordination disorder throughout his life.\n\nThe Crimewatch Roadshow presenter told Press Association that dyspraxia is \"kind of like dyslexia with your hands\", explaining that he struggled in school when he was unable to do activities that his classmates could with ease.\n\nSigns of dyspraxia may be present from an early age, with possible symptoms including poor co-ordination skills and untidy handwriting.\n\nSo what is dyspraxia, what are the symptoms and how common is it? Here's everything you need to know:\n\nWhat is it?\n\nDyspraxia is a form of developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD), the Dyspraxia Foundation states.\n\nThe disorder can affect fine motor skills \u2013 the co-ordination of small muscles, such as the hands and fingers \u2013 and gross motor skills \u2013 the co-ordination of large muscles, such as the arms, legs and torso.\n\nThe condition may also impact a person's articulation when speaking.\n\nWhile the terms dyspraxia and DCD are sometimes used interchangeably, they don't always refer to the same condition when used.\n\nThe NHS explains that the term \"DCD\" is preferred by the majority of healthcare professionals, as the term \"dyspraxia\" may have \"several meanings\".\n\n\"For example, dyspraxia can be used to describe movement difficulties that occur later in life as a result of damage to the brain, such as from a stroke or head injury,\" the NHS adds.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nSigns of dyspraxia may become evident from a young age in infants and children.\n\nThese symptoms include difficulty playing with toys or taking part in games that involve co-ordination skills, trouble using cutlery, untidy handwriting and an inability to do tasks such as doing up buttons or tying shoelaces, the NHS states.\n\nOther symptoms may include falling over frequently and dropping objects.\n\nHowever, the NHS points out that these signs may not necessarily by indicative of dyspraxia.\n\nFor more information about symptoms of dyspraxia, click here.\n\nPete Guest, founder of Dyspraxia and Life magazine, discovered he had dyspraxia at the age of 31, having struggled with the condition at school.\n\nGuest, who has not been formally diagnosed with the condition, explains that it can be hard for adults to be diagnosed with dyspraxia through the NHS.\n\n\"The pathway isn\u2019t clear and the NHS will not fund diagnostic assessment in adulthood meaning they need to pay up to \u00a3800 to be diagnosed privately,\" Guest tells The Independent.\n\n\"This is something many in the community really want to see change as it is unthinkable that you should have to pay for a diagnosis of something you have had since the day you were born.\u201d\n\nWhat are the causes?\n\nWhile there is no confirmed cause of dyspraxia, there are factors that may put a child at greater risk of developing the disorder.\n\nThese include being born prematurely, weighing a below-average weight at birth and having relatives who had DCD, the NHS outlines.\n\nFor more about factors associated with increased risk of developing dyspraxia, visit the NHS website here.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
