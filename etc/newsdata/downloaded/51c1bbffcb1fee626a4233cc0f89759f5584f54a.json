And they (Harry and Meghan) love each other. It's quite obvious when you see them together.'\n\nBurrell, 61, has become a frequent commentator on Diana and the royal family since leaving the palace after Diana's death in 1997, and was in New York promoting a documentary at a contentious time for Prince Harry.\n\nHarry, 35, said in a recently aired ITV interview that he would 'not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,' after attacking the press over the public scrutiny that he and wife Meghan have faced.\n\nBurrell suggested that Harry's brother Prince William, who is third in line to the throne and his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, have enjoyed a smoother ride from the palace and the press because their future is largely predetermined.\n\nBurrell (pictured on October 23), 61, has become a frequent commentator on Diana and the royal family since leaving the palace after Diana's death in 1997, and was in New York promoting a documentary at a contentious time for Prince Harry\n\nThe two brothers are often called 'the heir and the spare,' which Harry hates, Burrell added.\n\nIt comes after the prince admitted in the documentary Harry & Meghan: An African Journey that some distance had grown between them.\n\n'Harry said that (he and William) are on different paths. I know what he means by that. William and Kate have a map in front of them. They're headed for monarchy,' Burrell said, adding that the Queen and Charles have left Harry to find his way.\n\n'There's no guidance. There's no support. There's no rulebook,' Burrell said.\n\nPalace aides had repeatedly denied reports of a rift between the Sussexes and the Cambridges, who had once been championed as the Royal family's 'Fab Four'.\n\nBurrell suggested that Harry's brother Prince William, who is third in line to the throne and his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge (pictured together), have enjoyed a smoother ride from the palace and the press because their future is largely predetermined\n\nBut when asked how much of the speculation was true for the ITV documentary which aired on Sunday night, Harry pointedly refused to deny a falling out.\n\nHe initially laughed in response to the question, then added: 'Part of this role, part of this job and this family being under the pressure it is under, inevitably stuff happens.\n\n'But look, we are brothers, we will always be brothers. We are certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and, as I know, he will always be there for me.'\n\nHe added: 'We don't see as much as we used to because we are so busy but I love him dearly and the majority of stuff is created out of nothing.\n\n'As brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.'\n\nFollowing rumours that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could move, Burrell added: 'I hope we don't lose Harry and Meghan because they are a tremendous asset to the royal family, and to Britain.'", "description": "Paul Burrell, a longtime British royal servant who became Diana's personal assistant, has suggested the young couple will fare better than the Prince and Princess of Wales ever did.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20125372-0-image-a-10_1571911350373.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
