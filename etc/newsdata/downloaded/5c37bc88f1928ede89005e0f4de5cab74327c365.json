Literally! (Image: Jason Fabok, DC Comics)\n\nIt\u2019s been a good long time since we last stepped into the world of the excellent Batman: Arkham games, but recently Bat-fans were sent all aflutter by a new teaser for what appears to be the next entry in the series being made by game developer Warner Bros. Montreal. This time, the villain seems to be a foe that appeared much more recently in the comics than gamers have dealt with before.\n\nThough it was first teased for DC\u2019s \u201cBatman Day\u201d celebratory bash in late September, since then the studio has made very little noise \u2014 like a Dark Knight skulking about the rooftops hunting its criminal foes \u2014 about what the game actually is, outside of a single teaser of four logos and an ominous threat: Capture the Knight.\n\nCapture the Knight / Cape sur la nuit pic.twitter.com/yMFXMd4djU \u2014 WB Games Montr\u00e9al (@WBGamesMTL) September 23, 2019\n\nWhile none of the logos match up with factions we know of from the comics \u2014 although one does look a little similar to a specific mask that we\u2019ll get to in a bit \u2014 it was actually a now-deleted tweet from DC Comics scribe and former Batman writer Scott Snyder that seemingly confirmed the game would revolve around the Court of Owls. So, who are they?\n\nSnyder would know. He\u2019s the writer, alongside artist Greg Capullo, who first introduced the mysterious faction to DC proper. So here\u2019s what you need to know before we end up learning specifically what this mysterious game is all about.\n\nBatman unravels the long, dark history of the Court. (Image: Greg Capullo, Jonathan Glapion, and FCO Plascencia, DC Comics)\n\nHence the name!\n\nCreated by the earliest colonialist families to call the township home, the Court funnelled money into every facet of society in Gotham, from its criminal underworld to its political leadership, to establish its loyal agents at every level of activity in Gotham. Using their vast political influence and capital, the Court spent centuries building up their own little bases hidden deep in the structures of Gotham\u2019s oldest buildings \u2014 places not to just store assets and conduct their business of controlling the city from the shadows, but to, uh, store the real sinister force behind the Court: the Talons.\n\nWhat, you thought it was gonna be a bunch of owl-masked socialites that did the actual dirty work? Absolutely not.\n\nOne of the logos in WB Montreal\u2019s tease, and William Cobb in his full Talon getup. (Image: Eddy Barrows and Rod Reis, DC Comics)\n\nThe Talons were the most trusted and elite agents of the Court, a tool to be wielded when even their vast influence could not force an event in Gotham to go their way. In their earliest years, there was only ever a single assassin to bear the Talon rank. They would be recruited as children, often stolen away from travelling circuses to hide the kidnappings, and the only way to leave service as a Talon was death. When either failure in the field or old age forced a new Talon candidate to be found, the newcomer would earn the right to claim the mantle by killing their predecessor in a trial by combat. Trained in a variety of martial arts, close quarter weaponry, and concealment, the Talon \u2014 who would don a ceremonial, ninja-esque outfit with a mask that looks pretty similar to the last of the logos teased in Warner Bros. Montreal\u2019s video \u2014 would be kept in a sort of deep cryostatic sleep by the Court until they needed to be deployed on missions.\n\nThat stasis was maintained by a special formula the Court would give to the Talon that also gave the assassin latent metahuman regenerative abilities, allowing them to recover from mortal wounds. It was made out of Electrum, a highly conductive special alloy that had special powers. Electrum ultimately played a major role in Snyder and Capullo\u2019s epic, pan-multiversal comics event Dark Nights: Metal, as one of the primal heavy metals agents of the evil god of the Dark Multiverse, Barbatos, used to slowly poison Batman and use his body as a key to summon their dark master into the prime DC Multiverse.\n\nThat whole pile of comic book craziness is a story for another time, however. All you need to know as far as the Owls were concerned was that the Electrum formula let their Talons cheat death, and the only way to counter its regenerative effects and actually let a Talon permanently die was through a special poison only known to members of the Court. Hiding in the shadows and pulling the strings of Gotham\u2019s entire infrastructure in secret \u2014 and deploying the Talon when those strings couldn\u2019t be pulled quite tight enough \u2014 this was how the Court of Owls operated for centuries, slipping into hearsay and legend in the city\u2019s oldest records, a nursery rhyme whispered to children of the city but never believed to actually be true.\n\nExcept it\u2019s comic books, so of course it\u2019s true, and the Court exploded back into prominence thanks in part to the rise of Batman. It turns out that, despite being members of Gotham\u2019s high society, the Waynes were never truly members of the Court\u2019s upper echelons; their philanthropy and longstanding reputation as figures of public good ultimately made them targets of the Court\u2019s machinations. Bruce\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Alan Wayne, directly opposed the Court\u2019s attempts to infiltrate Gotham and was horrifically tortured to death by them \u2014 and when Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered in Crime Alley, a young and distraught Bruce remembered the legend of the Court and tried to investigate to see if they were behind his parent\u2019s death, only to ultimately come to the conclusion that the Court was just a myth told to scare children (suffice to say, he was not quite yet the World\u2019s Greatest Detective, so we\u2019ll forgive him for his error).\n\nThe Talon strikes. (Image: Greg Capullo and FCO Plascencia, DC Comics)\n\nIt was only when Bruce himself launched a new philanthropic initiative to restructure and rebuild Gotham in the wake of his launch of Batman Inc. that the Court refocused itself on a Wayne. When the group sends its current active Talon, William Cobb, after Bruce during a meeting with Gotham Mayoral candidate Lincoln March, Bruce manages to seemingly kill the assassin by sending him tumbling from the top of Wayne Tower. After Bruce followed Cobb\u2019s trail as Batman and uncovered the Court\u2019s labyrinthine lair beneath the city, the Court of Owls went on full assault against Bruce, activating every one of its Talon candidates in an attempt to invade the city in a single sweep and wrest control of it by force.\n\nBut as well as going after Bruce\u2019s plans for reform, the Court and its Talons also went directly after the legacy of Batman himself, believing that the Dark Knight\u2019s mythos and influence on not just the good of the city, but in its criminal underworld thanks to his larger-than-life gallery of rogues, had usurped the Court\u2019s own semi-mythological status in Gotham\u2019s history. The battle became one for Gotham\u2019s ideological soul as well as a physical one, with the Talons not just targeting Batman and his extended family of allies, but also his villains, forcing Bruce and his team to not just defend themselves, but some of their most dastardly foes.\n\nMarch reveals himself as a member of the Court. (Image: \u00c1lvaro Mart\u00ednez, Ra\u00fal Fern\u00e1ndez, June Chung, and John J. Hill, DC Comics)\n\nSpoilers: Batman wins the war in what is dubbed the \u201cNight of the Owls.\u201d He\u2019s Batman, of course he does. But before he can bring members of the Owls\u2019 inner court to justice, they\u2019re all poisoned by March \u2014 who, twist, was secretly a member of the Court of Owls and also happened to believe he was actually Bruce Wayne\u2019s long lost brother? This arc was a lot \u2014 acting in seeming vengeance for the death of Bruce\u2019s, and who he believed to be his own, parents, before engaging in one last explosive scrap with Batman.\n\nMarch eventually escaped the encounter thanks to the regenerative abilities granted by the Talon\u2019s Electrum serum and would eventually return as a thorn in Bruce\u2019s side under the auspices of a new council in the Court of Owls, only to be defeated once again. Although the Court has yet to return to the prominence of their debut appearance, Bruce hasn\u2019t really truly defeated them; even to this day, their agents, diminished as they are, lurk in the shadows, rebuilding and waiting for the chance to take the Dark Knight down once and for all.", "description": "It\u2019s been a good long time since we last stepped into the world of the excellent Batman: Arkham games, but recently Bat-fans were sent all aflutter by a new teaser for what appears to be the next entry in the series being made by game developer Warner Bros.
