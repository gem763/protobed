In the second half, several more shouts of \u201cFree Hong Kong!\u201d echoed throughout the arena during the lightly attended game.\n\nBefore the game, members of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation stood outside two arena entrances handing out \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d T-shirts and holding signs admonishing the NBA for its initial handling of the fast-moving story that has mushroomed into a political battleground involving free speech and the league\u2019s financial interest in China.\n\n\u201cWe basically and totally support the original message that Daryl Morey sent out in support of the protesters in Hong Kong that sparked this NBA crisis,\u201d said Marion Smith, the executive director of the Victims of Communism organization. \u201cI think the fallout has revealed how [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver has put their eggs in the Chinese party\u2019s communist basket.\u201d\n\nBefore the game, a group of men wearing \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d T-shirts who were not affiliated with the organization, according to Smith, stood in the lower bowl of the arena as one held a sign reading \u201cGoogle Uyghurs,\u201d referring to an ethnic minority in Asia. A Twitter user posted a video of the sign being confiscated. Capital One Arena has a policy stating signs \u201cmay not be commercial or political in nature.\u201d\n\nOur \u201cGoogle Uyghurs\u201d sign has been confiscated. pic.twitter.com/fX4tF4oOxR \u2014 Jon Schweppe (@JonSchweppe) October 9, 2019\n\nFollowing the singing of the Chinese national anthem, the first of the disruptions started.\n\nWith the arena lights still dark and images of the Chinese flag aglow on the overhead scoreboard, a single protester in section 217 held a handwritten sign and shouted for freedom of speech and freedom for Hong Kong. His shouts cut through the silence in the arena, and he left his seat by his own volition while followed by an arena usher.\n\nAt the end of the Chinese national anthem and during the silence before the singing of the Star Spangled Banner, a protestor screams \u201cFree Hong Kong!\u201d while holding a sign. He walks out of the arena peacefully, followed by an usher. pic.twitter.com/H9JrZHb9FO \u2014 Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) October 9, 2019\n\nDuring the game, more protesters, sometimes in groups of two, scattered in various sections around the arena, shouted in support of Hong Kong or other causes.\n\nA pair of pro-Tibet protesters stood near the front seats of section 103, off to the left of the Wizards\u2019 bench. While one held a \u2018Free Tibet\u2019 sign, the other raised a Tibetan flag. The men left the lower bowl after a security guard entered the stands where they were standing. The guard followed the men up the stairs as several Wizards players and staffers turned to watch the scene. According to a Wizards spokesperson, no protesters were asked to leave the arena Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said of the protests during the game. \"I heard the one during the end of the national anthem. Other than that I didn\u2019t hear. I was focused on the game. The focus just right now is just on the team and how we need to keep playing and improving, and I have things that I need to worry about and be concerned of right now. I did hear the first part. I didn\u2019t hear anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cFree Tibet\u201d protest during second quarter of #Wizards game.

On Sunday, the league released a statement in English in which it expressed a recognition that Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d Silver later offered another statement, declaring the league \u201cwill not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nFor Smith, the statement was not enough, and he has called for Silver\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s extremely disappointing that Silver and NBA leadership came down like a ton of bricks on Morey to issue an apology and delete his original tweet,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis is not what the greatest sport in America is supposed to do, and I think Adam Silver is responsible for this. \u2026 We are calling for his resignation because we have been following this for a few years.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nGregg Popovich praises Adam Silver for \u2018courage\u2019 in China, takes a dig at Trump\n\nBrewer: It took an uncomfortably long time, but Adam Silver got it right on NBA and China\n\nBlackistone: While Adam Silver tries to straddle a line on China, the NBA misses an opportunity\n\nJenkins: Don\u2019t be mad at the NBA.
