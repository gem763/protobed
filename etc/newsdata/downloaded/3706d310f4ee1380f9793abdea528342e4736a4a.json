Jim Young/Pool via REUTERS\n\nOn Tuesday, the one-year anniversary of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, the first of two fatal crashes of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max, Boeing (BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg is scheduled to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee, Science, and Transportation concerning the company\u2019s design, development, and certification of the aircraft.\n\nIt\u2019s one of two scheduled Congressional public hearings this week where Muilenburg will be in the in the hot seat. On Wednesday, members of the House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee are scheduled to hold a hearing to question the CEO. Muilenburg previously turned down the House Committee\u2019s earlier invitation to testify.\n\n\u201cWe know we made mistakes and got some things wrong. We own that, and we are fixing them. We have developed improvements to the 737 MAX to ensure that accidents like these never happen again,\u201d Muilenburg is expected to say, according to remarks prepared ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing.\n\nJohn Hamilton, Vice President and Chief Engineer for Boeing\u2019s Commercial Airplanes, who served as the company\u2019s President of Engineering at the time of the crashes, is also slated to testify during both hearings.\n\n\u2018Erroneous signals\u2019\n\nMulienburg will be tasked with balancing testimony that assures global regulators, victims\u2019 families, its customers, and the flying public that the company\u2019s proposed Max changes are aggressive enough to avoid future risks associated with the aircraft\u2019s design, yet insignificant enough to trigger the imposition of additional liability on the company. Lawmakers are reportedly prepared to question whether Boeing was aware of risks associated with the Max\u2019s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS system. They will also ask whether employees felt pressure to skirt safety enhancements in efforts to get the plane to market quickly.\n\n\u201cWe know that both accidents involved the repeated activation of a flight control software function called MCAS, which responded to erroneous signals from a sensor that measures the airplane\u2019s angle of attack,\u201d Muilenburg\u2019s prepared remarks say.\n\nAerial photos showing Boeing 737 Max airplanes parked at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, U.S. October 20, 2019.

The reports place varying degrees of fault on the plane manufacturer.\n\nIndonesian officials who examined the Lion Air crash placed blame Boeing, the F.A.A., and a Florida-based parts supplier, as well as Lion Air flight and maintenance crews. A group of international regulators from the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Australia, Japan, Brazil, Singapore, China, Indonesia, and United Arab Emirates, tasked with examining only the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) certification process, concluded the process should ensure fail-safe design principles that minimize reliance on pilot action as a primary means of risk mitigation. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the accident pilots\u2019 responses to MCAS were inconsistent with Boeing\u2019s assumptions, and recommended tools to effectively alert pilots to airplane failures to improve response timeliness.\n\nFAA guidance allows such assumptions to be made in certification analyses without providing clear direction about the consideration of multiple flight-deck alerts and indications in evaluating pilot recognition and response. The NTSB\u2019s report states that more robust tools and methods need to be used for validating assumptions about pilot response to airplane failures in safety assessments developed as part of the U.S. design certification process.\n\n\u2018A race to the bottom\u2019\n\nFormer cockpit designer, NTSB investigator, and F.A.A. Human Performance Program Scientist, Dr. Alan Diehl, told Yahoo Finance the certification process started to decline in effectiveness 40 years ago when Congress deregulated the airline industry.", "description": "On Tuesday, the one-year anniversary of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, the first of two fatal crashes of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg is scheduled to testify before the Senate.", "authors": ["Alexis Keenan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cFOcPwk2cY8q06KrtiCp1w--~B/aD0yNTcxO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a3679f50-fa47-11e9-9df8-6165dcac9d33", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
