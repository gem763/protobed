However, in 2000, the actress filed for divorce and an injunction prohibiting Tony from contacting her and their children, citing abuse as reason for her decision.\n\nTony had denied the allegation and even went on television to appeal to Eva to reconsider her decision. The divorce became official in 2004.\n\nvOn the other hand, Tony, who confirmed to be separated from his third wife recently, stated that he still owed his second wife Eva, saying that the actress has been a good mother to their children.\n\n(Photo Source: Orgs.one)", "description": "The Hong Kong actress doesn't care about the actor's third failed marriage despite his recent praise for her", "authors": ["Heidi Hsia"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UEceiAuQDTNQ00R5byFezg--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ybrand.cinema.com.my/d0fa9a200b1572ab0a7741ac6c8cb62e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
