Demonstrators have set fire to cars and garbage bins and thrown rocks at police, who have responded with batons and rubber bullets.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t justify the violence, but we are simply defending ourselves from the repression of the police,\u201d Aida said.\n\nLike Aida, those responsible for the violence are all young, sometimes even minors. They are not intimidated by the television crews, sometimes waving to the camera or dancing in front of burning barricades.\n\nOlivier Cauberghs, a Belgian expert in detecting and preventing radicalisation, said young pro-independence Catalans who have only recently turned to violence have \u201cgone through a long process and didn\u2019t decide to turn violent\u201d overnight.\n\nThey are reacting to police violence that marred a banned independence referendum held in October 2017 and the failed declaration of independence that followed, Cauberghs said.\n\nThe expert, who works with Belgian police and is in Barcelona to observe the protests, told AFP the youths appeared to be letting off steam.\n\nUnlike the anarchists who perpetually commit violence against police, these young separatist activists \u201cwill go back to their stuff\u201d, he added.\n\n\u2013 Foreign radicals \u2013\n\nAlongside these frustrated separatists, there are more experienced groups who wear balaclavas and are usually on the frontlines of the clashes with police.\n\n\u201cThe tactics they use are not from someone who is using violence for the first time,\u201d Cauberghs said.\n\n\u201cThey fall within an anarchist profile, they attack the police no matter what, since they are a physical representation of the state.\u201d\n\nFurther evidence of an anarchist presence is the appearance of graffiti with the popular anarchist acronym ACAB, which stands for \u201cAll Cops Are Bastards\u201d, on walls, bus shelters and storefronts.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said Friday that \u201cviolent groups who focus their violence on national police in an organised way\u201d were among those behind the violence.\n\nHe did not rule out the possibility that radical youths had come from other European nations to cause trouble.\n\nAn interior ministry spokesman said 13 percent of the people arrested at the protests were foreigners.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Cause chaos\u2019 \u2013\n\nOther youths, who are unemployed and not political, say they are at the protests with the intention of causing unrest.\n\n\u201cI feel Spanish and I am not a separatist. I come to cause chaos and also because I don\u2019t think it is right to put politicians in jail for their opinions,\u201d one 19-year-old told AFP.\n\nHe declined to be named because he took part in violence against police.\n\nThe police \u201cmust understand that we know how to show our displeasure, we are not afraid of anything,\u201d he added.\n\nHis 17-year-old friend, who also declined to be named, is of Venezuelan origin and lives in a juvenile welfare home.\n\nHe also criticised \u201cpolice violence\u201d.\n\nThe two youths, who live in a Barcelona suburb, do not speak Catalan and have no links to the separatist movement.\n\n\u201cThese youths don\u2019t have a good education, no jobs and no future perspective,\u201d Cauberghs said.\n\n\u201cThey express their frustration against a society that treats them without justice.\u201d", "description": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013 The violent protests that have swept Catalonia over the jailing of nine separatist leaders have involved veteran anarchists and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/b14dfb_600-people-injured-in-clashes-police-catalonia-protests-started-who-are-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
