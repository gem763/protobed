His straightforward style and personal integrity make him an ideal person to lead the business.\n\n\u201cAt the Guardian, he has shown strong leadership through a period of change and transformation. Returning the group to profit is an impressive achievement and has demonstrated that he can develop and execute a transformational plan in an ever-changing business landscape. In addition, he has worked with the big players in digital and media and has managed diverse groups and constituencies.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working with David and are sure he will be a great asset to the Premier League.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we would like to extend our huge appreciation to Richard Masters, who has captained the ship expertly this year as Interim Chief Executive. Richard and his team have done a great job and will continue to drive the League forward under David\u2019s leadership.\u201d", "description": "The Premier League has confirmed the appointment of David Pemsel\u00a0as the organisation\u2019s new chief executive.
