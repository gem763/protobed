This is so important for the economy.\u201d\n\nWith the Republican-led Senate seen as likely to approve the trade deal, the fight centers on the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and fellow Democrats say they would like to see changes in the deal but have been careful not to close the door to eventual ratification.\n\nEven as House Democrats were consumed this week with gearing up the impeachment inquiry, Mrs. Pelosi in a Sept. 30 letter wrote to her Democratic caucus that talks with the Trump administration on a USMCA vote were continuing. Mexico has already approved the deal and Canadian approval is also expected \u2014 so long as the U.S. in on board.\n\nMrs. Pelosi said this week that House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, Massachusetts Democrat, and a USMCA \u201cworking group\u201d were still in talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer \u201cto secure key improvements\u201d to the accord.\n\n\u201cWe hope to continue further down the path to yes, but insist that any trade agreement strengthen America\u2019s working families,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi wrote.\n\nMr. Lighthizer has said he also remains optimistic of passage.\n\nBut the impeachment dynamic has introduced a real note of uncertainty into the talks. President Trump himself speculated last week that the updated NAFTA deal could be in trouble.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Nancy Pelosi will have time,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cShe\u2019s wasting her time on a \u2014 you know, let\u2019s use a word that they used to use a lot: a \u2018manufactured crisis.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Hill\u2019s two top Republicans \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, said in a joint Wall Street Journal op-ed piece Tuesday they feared Democrats were trying to run out the clock on the USMCA to deny Mr. Trump a victory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s delay tactics to end,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHouse Democrats need to put the country first and stop blocking this significant victory for the American people.\u201d\n\nApproval of the deal would also provide the Trump White House with a useful weapon in the even more contentious battle to strike a trade deal with China, a battle that shows few sings of ending quickly or quietly.\n\n\u201cIf anybody in either party were trying to jeopardize USMCA as a result of, or as collateral damage because of their differences over the current investigations and current movements towards the impeachment, the entirety of the business community would rise up and challenge them on that,\u201d the Chamber\u2019s Mr. Bradley said.\n\nMr. Trump last November joined leaders of Mexico and Canada in signing a new three-way trade pact to replace NAFTA, following through on a key campaign promise to overhaul the 1994 agreement that he repeatedly described as the \u201cworst deal ever made,\u201d one that hastened the hollowing out of U.S. manufacturing.\n\nThe new agreement sets updated rules on agriculture, technology and auto imports, protects autoworkers\u2019 jobs in the U.S. and opens Canada to American dairy products.\n\nThe Chamber has set a Thanksgiving deadline for Congress to pass the updated NAFTA accord.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t pick that day because we liked Thanksgiving turkey and pecan pie,\u201d Mr. Bradley said. \u201cWe picked that based off where we thought the progress is and the negotiations and the timeline for approval.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
