Monthly and weekly transit passes would both be eligible for the tax credit, as would electronic fare cards when used for an extended period.\n\nWhen the Liberals cut the public transit tax credit, it was costing the federal government about $200 million a year. A report by the federal auditor general in 2017 concluded the credit would have a \"negligible impact on Canada's greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nScheer will continue campaigning in Toronto-area ridings throughout the day, after participating in his first televised debate as Conservative leader last night.\n\nThe NDP's Singh also spent his morning in the GTA, trying to appeal to Canadians worried about their pocketbooks.\n\nSurrounded by supporters holding prop signs with dollar figures and sad emojis, Jagmeet Singh talked about the NDP's plan to put a price cap on cellphone and internet services.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh spoke to reporters in the Toronto riding of Beaches East York 1:30\n\n\"We are paying some of the highest bills in the world when we talk about cellphone or internet services,\" Singh said during a campaign stop in the urban riding of Toronto\u2013Danforth once represented by the late Jack Layton. \"There's got to be a better way.\"\n\nSingh went after Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, accusing it of kowtowing to telecommunications corporations.", "description": "Andrew Scheer and Jagmeet Singh are pitching pocketbook issues today, with the Conservatives promising to give money back to public transit users and the New Democrats pledging to make cellphone and internet bills cheaper.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5282544.1568389497!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/singh-scheer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
