Instead, she wanted to study courses which were wide-ranging and would help her stand out in a very competitive job market.\n\n\u201cThe interconnected global economy has given rise to supply chain management (SCM), which is playing an increasingly important role in international trade,\u201d Yue says. \u201cDemand for these services is bound to be massive. That said, SCM wasn\u2019t mentioned much in my school days, so I had no real concept of what it involved. But as luck would have it, I attended a talk on a related topic and found myself absolutely fascinated. That led to wanting to know more about the area.\u201d\n\nChristy worked at Cathay Pacific Airways's office in Bangkok as a summer intern, and was put in charge of cargo planning and loading calculations.

In 2018, she spent two months in the airline\u2019s Bangkok office, which was a chance to gain broader experience and new perspectives.\n\n\u201cI worked at the cargo terminal, which involves a wide range of logistics activities,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I started, I didn\u2019t know much about air freight management and I wasn\u2019t familiar with the types of air cargo or the packaging methods. However, my SCM training helped in picking things up quite effectively. My supervisor mostly asked me to do cargo planning and loading calculations, and I was quite happy handling that kind of work.\u201d\n\nYue\u2019s Thai colleagues made her feel welcome, which helped with settling in quickly and making the most of the internship.\n\nNot many people have the chance to work in the interior of a cargo plane.

I believe, though, that my Thai friends might find the work ethic of people in Hong Kong a little intimidating.\u201d\n\nThe internship changed Yue\u2019s view of workplace culture, while also confirming her belief that she has what it takes to function well in any work environment.\n\n\u201cI used to think that all workplaces shared a similar pattern of behaviour,\u201d she says. \u201cBut my experience with the airline taught me that every office has its own specific approach to getting the job done. Now I am more open-minded and flexible in the way I see things, and I believe I will fit in wherever I go after graduation.\u201d\n\nEdited by John Cremer", "description": "Sponsored Feature", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/img0800.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
