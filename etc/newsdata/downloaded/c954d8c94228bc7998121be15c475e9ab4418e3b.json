Trump's got an app for that The Trump campaign plans to launch its own app soon, professionalizing its operation to track \u2018the army of Trump\u2019 and keep supporters donating, volunteering and recruiting.\n\nSometimes Twitter isn\u2019t enough.\n\nAfter spending years alleging anti-conservative bias on social media, President Donald Trump will soon have another way to get his message out how he wants.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign plans to launch a new smartphone app this fall to encourage supporters to donate, volunteer and reel in like-minded voters \u2014 all while providing the president more unfiltered access to his followers. Supporters who download the all-in-one app are expected to be able to sign up for a Make America Great Again rally, canvas a neighborhood or call voters, maybe even register to vote as the campaign looks to turn passive supporters into activists.\n\nPerhaps the most important feature will be the app\u2019s use of prizes \u2014 maybe VIP seats or a photo with Trump \u2014 to persuade the most fervent supporters to recruit their friends, rewarding them as campaigns have been doing for top donors for years, according to people familiar with the plans.\n\nThe upcoming launch is the latest sign of how Trump\u2019s team, which ran a ragtag operation in 2016, is using its huge coffers to drive a more professional and data-driven operation. While campaigns have had apps for years, the new Trump app is expected to let the president\u2018s team track followers in a more comprehensive way than ever before in their bid to secure the president another White House term.\n\nThe app could help the campaign connect with potential voters as aides focus their reelection strategy more on turning out their conservative base on Election Day and less on persuading undecideds to vote for Trump. But first the campaign will need to persuade people to download the app, an arduous task that digital experts say has doomed other apps.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The app could build on that mission, silently gathering preferences about supporters to create profiles that could be used to tailor specific messages to specific voters down to the color of an ad.\n\nTrump\u2018s campaign didn\u2019t respond to questions about the app, which originally had been scheduled to debut this summer. But Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s digital guru turned campaign manager, has spoken about his goal to directly contact and target millions more supporters than the campaign did in 2016.\n\n\u201cThis is how Donald Trump stays president for four more years,\u201d said Parscale, holding up his iPhone on stage at a Trump rally last year. \u201cNow this phone is how we connect with you. It\u2019s how we turn you into the army of Trump.\u201c\n\nPresidential campaigns have been using apps since 2012 as they sought to reach Americans trading land lines for mobile phones. Now they\u2019re so common that candidates in state and local races use them.\n\nIn 2016, Trump \u2014 as well as Democratic rival Hillary Clinton \u2014 launched apps that provided canvassing information, campaign updates and ways to connect with others on social media. But they started late \u2014 both came in the weeks before Election Day \u2014 and, like most apps at the time, faced limits on what functions were offered and concerns about privacy.\n\nThe Trump campaign app, dubbed America First, had about 120,000 registered users in 2016, said Thomas Peters, the CEO of UCampaign, which built the Trump app in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for campaigns in the current era we\u2019re in \u2014 when attention is oversaturated \u2014 is to reach people where they are,\u201d said Eric Wilson, who was digital director for Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential bid and now managing partner at Startup Caucus, a Republican tech accelerator. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer to go into the app space on campaigns. It\u2019s an important battleground.\u201d\n\nBetsy Hoover, who was online organizing director for Barack Obama\u2019s campaign and later co-founded Higher Ground Labs, which invests in technology tools for Democrats, said candidates generally can\u2019t rely on an app alone \u2014 even though it may be easier to have everything in one place \u2014 in part because of the arduous task of persuading someone to download it.\n\n\u201cAn app itself is not the answer,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need a program and a strategy that engages supporters and builds community around your campaign. An app can help you achieve that strategy \u2014 but the strategy must be the primary focus and drive the usage of the app. If your goal is to recruit and train new people, an app is probably not your tool. If your goal is to increase the action your best supporters are taking, an app might be a great tool for management.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, the app is about more than all of that.\n\n\u201cNow this phone is how we connect with you. It\u2019s how we turn you into the army of Trump,\" Brad Parscale said at a Trump campaign rally. | Paul Sancya/AP Photo\n\nIt will allow the president, who regularly accuses tech companies of bias against conservatives, to bypass Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites altogether. Tech companies deny any political favoritism but Trump insists he and others are being targeted.\n\n\u201cWe have terrible bias. We have censorship like no one has any understanding, nobody can believe,\u201c Trump said in July when he convened a social media summit at the White House. \u201cThey're playing with a lot of minds and they're playing unfairly.\u201c\n\nTrump certainly isn\u2019t expected to stop tweeting, but the app will help him and his aides communicate directly with his most fervent supporters in a new and unfiltered way.\n\n\u201cThe app is a great way to circumvent Facebook and Twitter,\u201d according to one of the people familiar with the plans. \u201cYou\u2019re reaching people directly.\u201d\n\nIt not only provides a way to hear from Trump but it offers a way for millions of die-hard Trump supporters to communicate with each other privately.\n\nPeters, of UCampaign, which is not involved in the new Trump app, said a large part of the appeal for the Trump operation in 2016 was having a \u201cprivate social network\u201d for supporters.\n\n\u201cEspecially for people who feel intimidated sharing their political views on an open social network, like Facebook or Twitter \u2014 they don't want to get into a fight with their cousin or their co-worker or just get into it at all \u2014 here's the place they know they can share messages and not invite a flame war,\u201d he said. \"They're going to get likes.\u201d\n\nSean Spicer, the former White House press secretary who worked for the Republican National Committee during the 2016 election, said both types of platforms are an asset for Trump: Twitter, Facebook and other social media outlets allow Trump to communicate with all types of people while the campaign app will rally the base.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not this or that. It\u2019s all of the above,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI think in this day and age, it adds one more element.\u201d\n\nNancy Scola contributed to this report.", "description": "The Trump campaign plans to launch its own app soon, professionalizing its operation to track \u201cthe army of Trump\u201d and keep supporters donating, volunteering and recruiting.", "authors": ["Anita Kumar"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/02/0d/15a408e94e94b868c7aec785241e/1997-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
