REUTERS/Toru Hanai/Files\n\nJapan's Nikkei .N225 climbed 1.0% while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.73%, led by gains in tech shares in South Korea and Taiwan.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) rose 1.2% after its profit guidance. The semiconductor firm said its third-quarter operating profit likely fell 56% on a downturn in global memory chip prices, but that was better than what analysts had anticipated.\n\nTaiwan's stock index .TWII gained 0.7% to hit five-month highs while Hong Kong shares .HSI extended gains after the territory's leader said she had no plans to use the emergency regulation ordinance to introduce other laws.\n\nShanghai shares .SSEC rose 0.3% after the week-long break though gains were led mainly by defensive shares ahead of the crucial trade talks.\n\nSpending on retail goods and dining during China\u2019s National Day holidays returned to growth this year, offering unexpected respite to an economy that has been expanding at its weakest pace in almost three decades.\n\nStill a private survey showed China\u2019s services sector grew at its slowest pace in seven months in September.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.45% on Monday, unable to sustain gains made after positive tweets and news headlines about the trade talks.\n\n\u201cGiven the importance of the event, markets will be extremely nervous. I expect things to stay this way for now. On the whole, markets are not that optimistic about the outlook,\u201d said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.\n\nU.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators on Monday launched two days of talks aimed at paving the way later this week for the first minister-level negotiations in months.\n\nBut prospects for progress in U.S.-China trade talks dimmed after Washington blacklisted Chinese companies over Beijing\u2019s treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.\n\nAmong those blacklisted, trading in video surveillance company Hikvision (002415.SZ) was suspended while voice recognition front-runner IFLYTEK Co (002230.SZ) fell as much as 3.1%.\n\nTrump also said he hoped China found a humane and peaceful resolution to the ongoing political protests in Hong Kong, and warned the situation had the potential to hurt trade talks.\n\nThe bilateral talks are getting underway ahead of a scheduled increase in U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.\n\nTrump has said the tariff increase will take effect if no progress is made in the negotiations.\n\n\u201cThis ongoing trade-war discussion is a much more secular theme rather than something that is going to be resolved in the next couple of days,\u201d said Maurice Meijers, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Dutch fund manager Robeco in Singapore.\n\nMeijers said he doesn\u2019t expect a sudden massive breakthrough that would give markets reason to rally. \u201cThat\u2019s very unlikely, I\u2019ll expect this to be an ongoing theme.\u201d\n\nIn the currency market, the Turkish lira steadied for now after declining more than 2% on Monday over concerns about Ankara\u2019s planned incursion in northern Syria.\n\nTrump threatened to destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Ankara takes a planned military strike in Syria too far even though the U.S. leader himself has opened the door for a Turkish incursion.\n\nThe lira TRYTOM=D3 traded at 5.837 per dollar, near its weakest level since Sept. 2.\n\nMajor currencies were more range-bound.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.0973 EUR=, with its recovery from its 2-1/2-year low of $1.10879 hit a week ago meeting a strong resistance around $1.10.\n\nThe dollar traded at 107.40 yen JPY=, up 0.15% after having found some support around 106.50 yen in the past few sessions.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2290 GBP=D4, capped by concerns that sizeable differences between Britain and the European Union remained for striking a Brexit withdrawal deal.\n\nThe yuan gained 0.35% to 7.1269 yuan per dollar CNY=CFXS after the Chinese central bank set a stronger-than-expected mid-point.\n\nU.S. debt yields jumped back as $78 billion in note and bond supply slated for auction this week helped push prices lower after last week\u2019s dramatic rise.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield last stood at 1.575% US10YT=RR.\n\nOil prices rose on Tuesday, as unrest in oil-producing countries Iraq and Ecuador raised concerns of supply disruption.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures rose 0.51% to $58.65 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 gained 0.61% to $53.07 per barrel.", "description": "Asian shares inched up on Tuesday, with Chinese shares making modest gains after a week-long holiday, though investors remained cautious over U.S.-China trade talks after President Donald Trump said a quick trade deal was unlikely.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438292508&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9706D", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
