The comical sight of Johnson stamping his feet and toys in the air, and demanding an immediate general election, is risible and even, in some way, tragic.\n\nTraumatised by the brain-washing to which he was subject at Eton, like the rest of these pitiful Bullingdon Club individuals, Johnson possesses an outrageous sense of entitlement and omnipotence \u2013 \u201cThe world will bend to my will, just by virtue of my demanding it!\u201d is their deeply ingrained but wholly deluded belief system.\n\nJohnson is desperate and beside himself to have an immediate election because he and Dominic Cummings know they can only win one on a divisive Brexit ticket. If the Tories were to fight an election based on their calamitous policy record since 2010, they\u2019d be comprehensively buried \u2013 hence the desperate, hysterical \u201cchicken\u201d abuse being thrown at Corbyn for not colluding with Johnson\u2019s only conceivable route to survival.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe very idea \u2013 mimicked, of course, by the supine \u201cDestroy Corbyn\u201d right-wing media \u2013 that it is Jeremy Corbyn who\u2019s \u201ca chicken\u201d, is as laughable as it is a beautiful example of psychological projection (and highly disturbed individuals are chronically subject to pathological projection, of course). For Johnson is the chicken \u2013 and a demented, headless one at that: telling any lie and bullying anyone in sight he think he needs to, in order to get his way.\n\nWe may be about to break a long-standing record for the shortest tenure prime minister ever \u2013 ie George Canning (1827), who was PM for just 119 days. Praise be if this unenviable record is about to be broken.\n\nRichard House\n\nStroud\n\nA pyrrhic victory against Boris Johnson\n\nThe passing of the act to require Boris Johnson to seek a three-month extension to Brexit from the EU is a pyrrhic victory for opponents of no deal. The tussle to seek an extension will only help Cummings pitch Johnson as \u201cthe people\u201d against parliament in the campaign. The key fact is the Conservatives\u2019 continuing 10 per cent lead in the opinion polls, meaning they will return to power with a fresh electoral mandate for no deal. They will immediately revoke the act and pass legislation to cause us to leave the EU unilaterally long before the extension has expired.\n\nThe underlying cause of our leaving with no deal and the resulting damage to our country will have been the unelectability of Labour led by Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nNick Cox\n\nLondon SW15\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He won\u2019t care if valued British conventions and sensibilities are trashed in the process.\n\nDebbie Stamper\n\nEpsom\n\nPunching above our weight\n\nThe Iranian oil tanker saga shines a troubling light on what passes for British diplomacy. (\u201cIran says tanker last seen off coast of Syria has reached its destination, and oil has been sold.\u201d)\n\nIt started with John Bolton\u2019s request that Britain seize \u2013 hijack is more appropriate \u2013 an Iranian oil tanker that had, so we are told, stopped at Gibraltar for provisions. The pretext was, believe it or not, a dubious extraterritorial interpretation of EU sanctions on Syria. We dutifully sent in the Royal Marines. Our prize was none other than Trump\u2019s \u201cambassadorial\u201d tweets as well as Iran\u2019s copybook seizure of British-flagged Stena Impero. As for the EU, nothing but silence concerning Britain\u2019s high-handed seizure. The EU-27 were upset by Britain\u2019s unilateral action given their desperate efforts to preserve the Iranian nuclear deal. They nevertheless kept quiet for fear of upsetting Washington. The unwieldy EU remains shackled to the lowest common denominator when it comes to policy. Isn\u2019t Brussels supposed to be a major international player?\n\nTo cap it all off, Britain blinked first. It released the Iranian tanker, having secured a meaningless promise from the Iranians that the tanker would not proceed to Syria. The tanker predictably ended up in a Syrian port. On its way there, the captain was offered a sizeable sum by US authorities to divert the tanker to a \u2018friendly\u2019 port. Such bribery amounts to piracy.\n\nSo much for Britain\u2019s espousal of a rules-based international order.\n\nYugo Kovach\n\nDorset\n\nBreaking up with British Airways\n\nI\u2019m in no position to evaluate whether or not British Airways\u2019 offer to its pilots is fair. What I do know is that as a passenger, I gave up on them years ago.\n\nWhen I travel, I need the help of a wheelchair. When I did fly BA, I always felt I got an insincere welcome and minimal offers of assistance. By contrast, when I fly Virgin Atlantic, the staff are universally welcoming and are always willing to help me in any way they can. Frequently on VA, I\u2019ve been told by the flight attendants that now they know I need help, I should just push the bell as often as I want.\n\nI\u2019m not so disabled that I can\u2019t do lots of things, but the contrast between the welcome I get on BA and the one I get on VA speaks volumes. So I gave up on BA years ago. I still think this is a shame, but there are just so many and better alternatives now.\n\nSteve Mumby\n\nBournemouth\n\nRoad traffic laws\n\nPerhaps your leader writer could look at the road traffic acts; it is and has been for many years a criminal offence to drive onto land not forming part of the road (amended to exclude driving over the pavement to reach a parking space within a few yards). While it is punishable by a small fine, it could still be punished by disqualification without limit of time, endorsement of driving licence and forfeiture of the vehicle involved.\n\nI suggest that it would only need one well publicised conviction and sentence for a dramatic reversal of common practice.\n\nPaul Baty\n\nAddress supplied", "description": "Boris Johnson is in a blind panic \u2013 not\u00a0good for a prime minister and a country\u2019s leader.
