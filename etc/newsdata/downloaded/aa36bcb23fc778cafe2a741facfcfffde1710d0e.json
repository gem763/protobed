Stuntman Mike Played by: Kurt Russell in Death Proof Kurt Russell in Death Proof Kurt Russell nails the slime-ball nature of Stuntman Mike, a character who's as B-movie as they come. Dimension Films 2/30 29. Billy Crash Played by: Walton Goggins in Django Unchained Walton Goggins in Django Unchained Of all the supporting characters in Tarantino's revisionist western, Billy Crash looms largest in the memory. Perhaps it's due to his mispronunciation of the protagonist's name (\"Duh-jang-go\") right after being shot in the genitals. \"The D is silent, hillbilly,\" Django responds, before finishing Crash off. What happens next, Goggins nails. TWC 3/30 28. Trudi Fraser Played by: Julia Butters in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Julia Butters in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Like much of the film that surrounds her, Trudi is a fantasy version of a child star \u2013 safe, in total charge of her own destiny and far smarter than many of the adults that surround her, including the has-been actor (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) she is paired with in her latest project. But through Trudi, and her overjoyed glee at being thrown to the ground while shooting a tense face-off scene involving her on-screen abductor, Tarantino reflects the pure, heady thrill of movie-making, and it\u2019s glorious to behold. Sony Pictures Releasing 4/30 27. Melanie Ralston Played by: Bridget Fonda in Jackie Brown Bridget Fonda in Jackie Brown A SoCal surfer girl bored out of her mind by the men she's holed up with, Bridget Fonda's Melanie only works because every one of her lines drips with scorn and apathy. There's a real pleasure in watching her kick back with a bong or answer the door with a bothered \"WHAT!\", even if it does lead her to a grim demise in a shopping mall parking lot. But at least she died as she lived: pissing off very unremarkable men. Miramax Films 5/30 26. Gogo Yubari Played by: Chiaki Kuriyama in Kill Bill Vol 1 Chiaki Kuriyama in Kill Bill Vol 1 Many of Tarantino\u2019s greatest villains take a kinky glee in violence, and none are more confident in their madness than Gogo, the personal bodyguard of O-Ren Ishii. She\u2019s also one of the most fun Kill Bill characters to watch on-screen, a twirling, spiked ball-wielding madwoman whose grace is only matched by her sadism. Miramax 6/30 25. Honey Bunny & Pumpkin Played by: Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth in Pulp Fiction Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth in Pulp Fiction Because we would hardly dream of splitting them up. \u201cAny of you f**king pricks move, and I\u2019ll execute every motherf**king last one of ya!\u201d remains one of cinema\u2019s greatest line readings, but Amanda Plummer\u2019s Honey Bunny and her on-screen fella Pumpkin, played by Tim Roth, are spectacular even before the line smashes the film into Dick Dale\u2019s \u201cMisirlou\u201d and Pulp Fiction\u2019s opening credits. The pair carefully dissect their imminent robbery of the patrons of a diner, spewing racist slurs and profanities while they go. They\u2019re a prototype for Mickey and Mallory from the Tarantino-scripted Natural Born Killers, with just as much manic and unmistakably carnal energy. Miramax Films 7/30 24. Captain Koons Played by: Christopher Walken in Pulp Fiction Christopher Walken in Pulp Fiction Captain Koons is the perfect example of a character damn well near stealing a film with a single scene. This is a character who hid a pocketwatch in his anus for years to protect it from being stolen, all to uphold the honour of one day delivering it to his friend's son. If that doesn't get you on this list, nothing will. Miramax Films 8/30 13. Pai Mei Played by: Gordon Liu in Kill Bill Vol 2 Gordon Liu in Kill Bill Vol 2 The kung fu master responsible for shaping Beatrix Kiddo into a warrior, Pai Mei is Kill Bill\u2019s by turns tyrannical and tender mentor figure. His beard, it should be said, is truly what all men should aspire to. Miramax 9/30 22. Lance Played by: Eric Stoltz in Pulp Fiction Eric Stoltz in Pulp Fiction Everyone needs a Lance in their life \u2013 someone you can call on night or day no matter the emergency. He might angrily protest when Vincent (John Travolta) shows up with an unconscious Mia (Uma Thurman), who has snorted one line too many, but there's never any doubt of him helping his pal through his predicament. Lance is as loyal as they come. Miramax Films 10/30 21. Rick Dalton Played by: Leonardo DiCaprio Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Leonardo DiCaprio Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood A classic down-on-his-luck Tarantino character who\u2019d rather self-destruct than acknowledge he doesn\u2019t truly matter anymore, Rick Dalton is so magnetic because he\u2019s also wildly funny. Played with as much a heavy-browed weariness by Leonardo DiCaprio as he is a child-like sense of wonder, he is entitled, ludicrously demanding and completely loveable. Sony Pictures Releasing 11/30 20. Elle Driver Played by: Elle Driver in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 Elle Driver in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 If Kill Bill is essentially a live-action cartoon, full of fantastical set pieces, superhuman fight sequences and discarded limbs, then Elle Driver is its most cartoonish element. Also, arguably, its most dazzlingly spectacular. As played by Daryl Hannah with tongue firmly in cheek, Elle sports an eyepatch, the cadence of a drag queen and a wardrobe straight out of Frederick\u2019s of Hollywood. She\u2019s the gay icon who never was. Miramax 12/30 19. Zo\u00eb Bell Played by: Zo\u00eb Bell in Death Proof Zo\u00eb Bell in Death Proof Zo\u00eb Bell is the unsung hero of every Tarantino films she's a part of, from Kill Bill (she's Uma Thurman's stunt double) to her sweary cameo in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Her real time to shine came in Death Proof in which she played herself and gets to lead the film's female characters in wreaking vengeance on Kurt Russell's murderous Stuntman Mike. Dimension Films 13/30 18. Butch Coolidge Played by: Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction Considering Bruce Willis rarely does subtle, it is striking that Butch Coolidge is such a laconic character. He is a man happy to throw boxing matches, flee to Mexico and use shotguns and samurai swords to fend off potential threats, yet barely breaks a sweat as he goes. It\u2019s probably because he\u2019s a sociopath, but Tarantino also grounds him in something that resembles heroism, or at least a Pulp Fiction spin on it. Miramax Films 14/30 17. Mr Pink Played by: Steve Buscemi in Reservoir Dogs Steve Buscemi in Reservoir Dogs Tarantino himself loved Mr Pink so much that he wanted the role for himself, but fortunately opted for Steve Buscemi after being blindsided by his audition. It's easy to see why. Miramax Films 15/30 16. Bill Played by: David Carradine in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 David Carradine in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 If you build a film around somebody so villainous the protagonist spends the entirety of its running time trying to kill them, you better make sure they're a good character. Bill, thankfully, lives up to expectations. Miramax 16/30 15. Vincent Vega Played by: John Travolta in Pulp Fiction John Travolta in Pulp Fiction There's a jaded melancholy to Vincent Vega that makes him so compelling to watch. He's no longer entirely fulfilled by his job and he\u2019s a little soft around the middle, his silent stoicism only broken by the occasional release of a cheesy grin, or his moves on the dancefloor with Mia Wallace. Additionally, there\u2019s a lovely black comedy to his presence throughout Pulp Fiction \u2013 from his ambiguous but clearly eventful history in Amsterdam, to his frequent trips to the bathroom, all of which seem to end in disaster. Miramax Films 17/30 14. Mr Blonde Played by: Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs Reservoir Dogs is one hell of a cold film and that's a lot to do with Mr Blonde. Madsen's character just loves committing unspeakably violent acts and it's this trait that infuses the film with the tension that makes it so memorable. Miramax Films 18/30 13. Marsellus Wallace Played by: Ving Rhames in Pulp Fiction Ving Rhames in Pulp Fiction In lesser hands, Marsellus Wallace would have faded into obscurity alongside the more irreverent Tarantino characters. But the way in which the viewer witnesses him experience an unspeakable trauma after his brawl with Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) \u2013 a fight that sees the pair's worlds collide with extremely sick-minded individuals \u2013 can't help but warm him to the viewer. Rhames's best role to date. Miramax Films 19/30 12. Jackie Brown Played by: Pam Grier in Jackie Brown Pam Grier in Jackie Brown Jackie Brown is introduced, in the words of an abusive federal agent, as \u201ca 44-year-old black woman desperately clinging on to this one sh**y little job [she] was fortunate enough to get\u201d. A flight attendant and part-time drug courier, Jackie\u2019s journey over the course of her film is among Tarantino\u2019s most invigorating. She finds the excitement sorely missing in her life, meets a man who respects her rather than uses her, and regularly outsmarts everyone else in the room. It\u2019s often of the fake-it-till-you-make-it variety, like in the nervous test runs of swiftly yanking a pistol out of her desk drawer in advance of the arrival of a man likely to kill her. But it makes her Tarantino\u2019s most human hero, nowhere near as showy as The Bride or Major Marquis Warren, but arguably all the better for it. Miramax Films 20/30 11. Aldo Raine Played by: Brad Pitt in Inglourious Basterds Brad Pitt in Inglourious Basterds \"You probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-takin' business; we in the killin' Nazi business. And cousin, business is a-boomin'\" \u2013 need we say more? Universal Pictures 21/30 10. Max Cherry Played by: Robert Forster in Jackie Brown Robert Forster in Jackie Brown Like Jackie Brown herself, bail bondsman Max Cherry arrives with decades of regrets weighing on his shoulders. Robert Forster grants the role an air of understated cool, Max eager for a fresh start and believing he has found it when an in-trouble flight attendant enters his life. If you kicked off your shoes, lifted a glass of scotch to your lips and threw on some vintage soul, you might match the energy Max exudes in every one of his scenes. Miramax Films 22/30 9. Shosanna Dreyfus Played by: Melanie Laurent in Inglourious Basterds Melanie Laurent in Inglourious Basterds If you think that Shosanna's placement on this list is anything to do with the scene in which she paints stripes on her face ahead of burning numerous Nazis to a crisp \u2013 all while David Bowie's \"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" plays \u2013 then you'd be right. Universal Pictures 23/30 8. Stephen Played by: Samuel L Jackson in Django Unchained Samuel L Jackson in Django Unchained Stephen is Django Unchained\u2019s version of a rorschach test \u2013 either a desperate victim forced into the unthinkable by circumstance, or the most insidiously evil character in the movie. A classic \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019 figure who runs the day-to-day operations of Calvin Candie\u2019s plantation, Stephen is a giggling, preening yes-man to Candie and his white superiors in public, but a ruthless and petty psychopath behind closed doors, expressing disgust at the sight of a free black man. Jackson contorts his face into a glowering, terrifying scowl, and it\u2019s the greatest thing he has ever done. TWC 24/30 7. Calvin Candie Played by: Leonardo DiCaprio in Django Unchained Leonardo DiCaprio in Django Unchained It was once difficult to think of DiCaprio as a villain, but thanks to the role of Calvin Candie, it's suddenly all too easy. Sometimes the greatest characters are the ones you can't wait to see meet their end and the horrendously racist Candie fits seamlessly on that list. TWC 25/30 6. Beatrix Kiddo AKA The Bride Played by: Uma Thurman in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 Uma Thurman in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 The many shots of Uma Thurman in that yellow outfit, sword in hand, is as iconic as anything Tarantino has done \u2013 and the character proves she's worthy of that status. Beatrix isn't just one of Tarantino's greatest creations, but one of the best heroines in cinematic history. Miramax 26/30 5. Cliff Booth Played by: Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Could stuntman Cliff Booth be Brad Pitt's greatest achievement? He's certainly up there. The kind of character that only Pitt could have played at this particular stage of his life. Sony Pictures Releasing 27/30 4. Mia Wallace Played by: Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction The iconic femme fatale whose ambivalent glare on the Pulp Fiction poster became one of the definitive images of 1990s cinema, Mia Wallace is a woman comprised of numerous contradictory parts. She is an icy addict permanently sticking things up her nose, but also a helpless dreamer captivated by what might have been. In anyone else\u2019s hands, Mia would be little but a male fantasy, but Uma Thurman imbues her with so much grit and heart that regardless of how brilliant the rest of Pulp Fiction is, you can\u2019t help but wish you could follow her on her own separate adventure. Miramax Films 28/30 3. Hans Landa Played by: Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds Is Hans Lands \u2013 perhaps best remembered by the moniker \"Jew Hunter\" \u2013 Tarantino's most detestable character? He's certainly up there. But he's also one of his greatest creations \u2013 a character you so desperately want to see get their comeuppance but fear they never will due to the exemplary way Christoph Waltz manages to switch on the charm as fluidly as the terror. Just remember, in his presence, always wait for the cream. Universal Pictures 29/30 2. Jules Winnfield Played by: Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction Tarantino's crowning glory might always be hitman Jules Winnfield's reciting of Ezekiel 25:17 before firing a round of bullets into the poor goons who dared to screw over his employer, but it probably wouldn't be so had it had been delivered by anyone but Samuel L Jackson. Miramax Films 30/30 1. O-Ren Ishii Played by: Lucy Liu in Kill Bill Vol 1 Lucy Liu in Kill Bill Vol 1 Many of Tarantino\u2019s best characters are dreamers of a sort \u2013 men and women left abandoned by the world who, through sheer force of will, climb to victory. Tarantino paints O-Ren as neither hero nor villain throughout Kill Bill, but instead a woman who took back the power stolen from her as a child, and who will do anything to maintain it in the face of threats from far weaker men. Her death at Beatrix\u2019s hand is stunning but also saddening, both due to Tarantino\u2019s interest in granting O-Ren the empathy, humour and sheer appeal of Beatrix herself (\u201cSilly caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords\u201d remains one of the finest lines in any movie), and via Lucy Liu\u2019s masterful performance. O-Ren is the finest depiction of what Tarantino can do with his creations, and one of the most fun and compelling characters in the QT canon. Miramax 1/30 30. Stuntman Mike Played by: Kurt Russell in Death Proof Kurt Russell in Death Proof Kurt Russell nails the slime-ball nature of Stuntman Mike, a character who's as B-movie as they come.

Jules Winnfield Played by: Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction Tarantino's crowning glory might always be hitman Jules Winnfield's reciting of Ezekiel 25:17 before firing a round of bullets into the poor goons who dared to screw over his employer, but it probably wouldn't be so had it had been delivered by anyone but Samuel L Jackson. Miramax Films 30/30 1. O-Ren Ishii Played by: Lucy Liu in Kill Bill Vol 1 Lucy Liu in Kill Bill Vol 1 Many of Tarantino\u2019s best characters are dreamers of a sort \u2013 men and women left abandoned by the world who, through sheer force of will, climb to victory. Tarantino paints O-Ren as neither hero nor villain throughout Kill Bill, but instead a woman who took back the power stolen from her as a child, and who will do anything to maintain it in the face of threats from far weaker men. Her death at Beatrix\u2019s hand is stunning but also saddening, both due to Tarantino\u2019s interest in granting O-Ren the empathy, humour and sheer appeal of Beatrix herself (\u201cSilly caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords\u201d remains one of the finest lines in any movie), and via Lucy Liu\u2019s masterful performance. O-Ren is the finest depiction of what Tarantino can do with his creations, and one of the most fun and compelling characters in the QT canon.

I double dare you, motherf***er!
