The electric buses have embedded terminals that provide battery levels and remaining driving distance for the vehicle. The terminal can also alert the system if there is an anomaly on the bus.\n\nKT and Hyundai will also collaborate to modify the system so it can be applied to electric trucks and new connected car platforms.\n\nHyundai is currently also in close collaboration with Cisco to create high-end 'hyperconnected' cars that operate within in-car networks.\n\nIn July, the automobile giant invested $4.2 million into a South Korean cab-calling firm as part of its expansion into the mobility market.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nKT applies battery conserving tech on 5G network\n\nThe application of Connected Mode Discontinuous Reception (CDRX) technology will allow 5G smartphone owners to save battery life.\n\nKT rolls out epidemic prevention app in Laos\n\nFollowing launches in West Africa, the South Korean telco is set to expand the rollout of its epidemic prevention platform to Southeast Asia as well.\n\nKT to expand deployment of 5G inside buildings\n\nKT will begin 5G services within large and crowded buildings such as airports and train stations.\n\nSamsung and KT succeed in compressing 8K broadcasting\n\nSamsung and KT SkyLife used a satellite's Ka band to send 8K video data to a TV on the ground.\n\nMobility as a Service could convert car drivers to bus riders (TechRepublic)\n\nA study of 21,000 consumers shows MaaS could change commuting habits and reduce congestion.
