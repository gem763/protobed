It\u2019s certainly being talked about among various members.\u201d\n\nFirtash is a Ukrainian citizen whom the Justice Department has tied to the Russian mafia, a relationship he has denied. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) in April 2018 accused Firtash of being a \u201cdirect agent\u201d of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government and using illicit money to fight extradition from his home in Vienna, Austria, to face trial in the bribery case, according to a letter Wicker sent to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and obtained by NBC earlier this year.\n\nWicker declined last week to comment about Firtash.\n\nFirtash hired conservative lawyers and GOP operatives Joe diGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing to represent him in his fight against the Justice department. A spokesperson for the diGenova & Toensing law firm said Parnas, a Ukrainian-American who also has ties to organized crime and is a client of Giuliani, was hired as a translator for Firtash and his lawyers.\n\nWhen asked whether Firtash had used Parnas, Fruman or their firm to supply money to the Trump or other Republican\u2019s campaign, the spokesperson replied \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d\n\nFirtash owns many of Ukraine\u2019s regional natural gas distribution companies, which buy gas from the state-owned company Naftogaz and then resell it, sources close to the company and media reports have said. He is said to have resold an estimated $2 billion of natural gas provided by Naftogaz without reimbursing the state-run company, people close to the Ukraine government and gas industry told POLITICO.\n\nLev Parnas. | Mark Lennihan/AP Photo\n\n\u201cThis is his cash cow,\u201d one person who works for the Ukraine government said of Firtash\u2019s connections to Naftogaz. If Firtash had been providing money to Parnas and Fruman, the person added, \u201cthe money from the gas corruption scheme in Ukraine is in the U.S. political system.\u201d\n\nParnas and Fruman also brought up Firtash\u2018s name to Ukrainian officials at a Houston meeting in March as they pitched their company Global Energy Producers LLC as a supplier of U.S. gas, according to Dale Perry, an executive at a U.S. gas company who does business in Ukraine and was informed about the meeting. NBC News first reported the two men\u2019s invoking of Firtash in their business dealings.\n\nFirtash also pressured the administration of former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to remove Naftogaz\u2018s reform-minded chief executive, Andriy Kobolyev, Perry said. Kobolyev had the backing of former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch to make those reforms.\n\nFirtash may have had the motive to help Parnas and Fruman push for Yovanovitch\u2018s removal, Perry told POLITICO.\n\n\u201cFirtash has the money and he has the reasons,\u201d Perry said.\n\nParnas and Fruman also donated money to former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), who advised that Trump recall Yovanovitch to the U.S. after the donation. Sessions told POLITICO earlier that he had met with Parnas and Fruman but declined to say whether he was the lawmaker their indictment named as \u201cCongressman 1.\u201d\n\nKoboylev did not respond to emails seeking comment. John Dowd, the lawyer representing Parnas and Fruman, did not respond to multiple calls and emails.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4a/cb/f5e0ad464feaa2127ced94f6ff4d/191023-firtash-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
