Sorry Boris. Your deal is not great, it's not new - and it's not Brexit.\n\n\"Mr Johnson's plan is to reheat most of Theresa May's appalling withdrawal agreement. Mrs May's deal would imprison Britain under EU rules with no voice, no vote, no veto - and no way out.\n\n\"It is the sort of treaty you sign after losing a war.\"\n\nMr Farage added: \"We need a general election to clear out the Remain parliament and win a majority for a real Brexit. When that election comes, we are ready to stand against MPs who vote for a bad deal today.\"\n\nHowever the hardline Brexiteers have been advised to vote for the prime minister's deal, according to leading Eurosceptic Steve Baker.\n\nMr Baker, who acts as an enforcer for the European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers, said the guidance to MPs was to \"vote for Boris' deal in the national interest\".\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

If the House of Commons votes for this today, within a fortnight we'll be living in a free country.\"\n\nThe DUP's Sammy Wilson attended the meeting, to make an eleventh hour plea to Brexiteers to oppose the plan.\n\nHe said: \"I know that the people in the ERG are good friends of Northern Ireland. They're not anti-unionist by any means.\n\n\"A lot of them are struggling with their consciences.\"\n\nOn the first Saturday sitting in nearly 40 years, Mr Johnson urged MPs to back his Brexit deal to heal the rift that the referendum result has caused in British politics.\n\nHe told MPs: \"The House will need no reminding that this is the second deal and the fourth vote, three-and-a-half years after the nation voted for Brexit.\n\n\"And during those years friendships have been strained, families divided and the attention of this House consumed by a single issue that has at times felt incapable of resolution.\n\n\"But I hope that this is the moment when we can finally achieve that resolution and reconcile the instincts that compete within us.\"\n\nBut he faces an uphill battle to get agreement on his deal from a hostile parliament - and he must also overcome a rebel amendment by Sir Oliver Letwin, that would withhold Commons approval until legislation to implement the deal is in place.", "description": "Nigel Farage has appealed to MPs to vote down Boris Johnson's deal in a historic Saturday sitting or risk passing an agreement that\u00a0was \"not Brexit\".
