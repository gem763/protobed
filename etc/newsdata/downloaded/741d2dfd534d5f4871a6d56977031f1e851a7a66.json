They first sent a letter to the White House asking for the documents by Sept. 16, but received no response.\n\nThe chairmen sent another letter on Sept. 24 to follow up, but again did not get a response from the White House. The subpoena demands that the White House hand over the requested documents by Oct. 18.\n\nFriday marked the third subpoena issued by House Democrats since they began their impeachment inquiry last week amid rising scrutiny over Trump's interactions with Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats have seized on details from a whistleblower complaint about Trump's efforts to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nTrump has questioned Biden's efforts as vice president to convince Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor in 2016.
