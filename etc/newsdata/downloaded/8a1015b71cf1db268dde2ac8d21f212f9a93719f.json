(AP Photo/Chuck Burton)\n\nNo. 15 Texas avoided a humiliating defeat on Saturday with a last-second field goal to escape from a home loss at the hands of Kansas, winning 50-48.\n\nKansas head coach Les Miles, however, has a bone to pick with how the game\u2019s fateful final minute played out on the clock in front of a Longhorns home crowd.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMiles confirmed to reporters Monday that the Jayhawks had asked the Big 12 Conference to look at two separate instances in Texas\u2019 game-winning drive on Saturday in which the game clock did not appear to start when it was supposed to, giving the Longhorns some crucial extra seconds to work with, according to the Kansas City Star.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll turn it in,\u201d Miles reportedly said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what they say.\u201d\n\nDid Texas get some home cooking vs. Kansas?\n\nThe final drive occurred after Kansas took a 48-47 lead thanks to a 22-yard Carter Stanley touchdown pass and a gutsy decision to go for a successful two-point conversion. Texas got the ball back with 1:11 left on the clock and two timeouts remaining.\n\nThe officials\u2019 first unusual handling of the game clock occurred when Texas completed a pass for a first down with 54 seconds left. By the Star\u2019s count, it took the officials 11 seconds to spot the ball and signal for the clock to restart despite procuring the ball almost immediately.\n\nThe second, much more questionable clock operation came with 32 seconds left on the clock. Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger scrambled for a key first down and remained in bounds. At that point, the clock was supposed to stop and restart when the chains were reset and the official gave the signal.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead, the clock started up again only when Ehlinger called for the snap on the next play, giving the Longhorns more than 10 free seconds. Texas would eventually kick the game-winning 33-yard field goal with five seconds left on the clock on the game\u2019s final play, though the team was within field-goal range earlier than that.\n\nMiles\u2019 analysis, from the Star:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been other conferences I\u2019ve been involved in. It seems like the hometown clock guy can sometimes quickly move the clock along sometimes inappropriately or sometimes hold the clock and not get it started when the play has started,\u201d Miles said. \u201cSo I think they\u2019ll have a look at that. We\u2019ll see what they say.\u201d\n\nWhether anything comes from Miles\u2019 complaints remains to be seen.\n\nLike all questionably called games, Kansas obviously didn\u2019t lose only because of the officials. The team\u2019s play also played a part. Yet, it still adds an interesting footnote on a truly surreal night in Austin.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Longhorns won thanks to a game-winning field goal drive in the final minute.
