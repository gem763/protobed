REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on a range of European foodstuffs as part of Washington\u2019s response to EU aircraft subsidies.\n\nThe higher tariffs would immediately raise prices by $5-$10 per bottle. Exporters may need to cut prices in order to avoid losing market share, which in turn may threaten producers, the French wine exporters\u2019 federation FEVS said.\n\n\u201cBordeaux is going through a difficult time at the moment,\u201d said Juliette Becot, who runs the Chateau Beau-Sejour Becot label in the region.\n\nShe said the U.S. tariffs had come at a particularly tricky moment, with the Bordeaux wine region having suffered from adverse weather conditions this year that hit production.\n\nFrench wine exports to the United States totalled $1 billion in 2018, or about 20% of total exports. Bordeaux wines accounted for more than a fourth of those exports, followed closely by those of Bourgogne and Beaujolais origins.\n\nChampagne is not included in the extra duties list.\n\nBecot and Pascal Amoreau, who helps run the Chateau Le Puy label, hoped that the world-class reputation of French wine would be sufficiently strong to ensure that U.S. consumers would continue to buy the country\u2019s products.\n\nNevertheless, Amoreau regretted Trump\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see that a president will deprive his fellow citizens of a large part of our French wine, just because of a little altercation or a little commercial war,\u201d said Amoreau.", "description": "A U.S. move to impose 25% duties on their wares has brought little cheer to the wine barons of Bordeaux, who fear a possible hit to their business at a time of other problems.", "authors": ["Regis Duvignau", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436993029&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930TG", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
