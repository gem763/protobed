(Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, news broke that Houston offensive lineman Justin Murphy was no longer with the team. Thursday night, Murphy shared his side of the story on Twitter, criticized the program\u2019s approach to \u201cactively tank\u201d the 2019 season and the way Houston coach Dana Holgorsen acted when Murphy went to speak to him.\n\nMurphy said in his Twitter thread, which you can read in full starting here, that he got an MRI on a troublesome right knee after Houston\u2019s game on Sept. 19. He said the MRI found problems with his meniscus and surgically-repaired ACL. Then around the same time that he had his knee looked at, he said Holgorsen had approached seniors on the team and asked if they wanted to redshirt for 2019. Houston started the season 1-3 with losses to Oklahoma, Washington State and Tulane.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat Monday I learned that the Head Coach of the Houston Cougars football team had personally contacted several seniors and asked them if they would redshirt for the 2019 football season, in order to \u201cdevelop\u201d and come back in 2020. \u2014 Justin Murphy (@JMurphy_73) October 11, 2019\n\nAll seniors which greatly contributed to the little success we had done up to that point. Two of the seniors would go on to accept this invitation, including the preseason Heisman dark horse QB. \u2014 Justin Murphy (@JMurphy_73) October 11, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nHouston\u2019s game on Sept. 19 was on Thursday night and was against Tulane. That following Monday, QB D\u2019Eriq King released a statement through the university that he was planning to redshirt the rest of the season and return in 2020 as players can now play in up to four games and still redshirt for a season. In that Tulane game, King had broken Tim Tebow\u2019s record for most consecutive games with both a rushing and a passing touchdown.\n\nHouston wide receiver Keith Corbin also announced that he was redshirting.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have time to talk\u2019\n\nMurphy, a sixth-year senior, transferred to Houston from Texas Tech and UCLA. He would not have been eligible for a redshirt to come back and play in 2020. He said that he made the decision to stop playing football knowing that his knee was struggling and that Houston wasn\u2019t playing to win in 2019, reasoning that if Houston wasn\u2019t committed to success during the season then he shouldn\u2019t push himself on a busted knee.\n\nThat decision came after he said he was suspended by the team for Houston\u2019s game against North Texas. Murphy, a starter on Houston\u2019s offensive line, had missed the game, per Holgorsen, because of his knee problems and didn\u2019t travel.\n\nMurphy said he was told not to get on the bus if he wasn\u2019t 100 percent committed to the team.\n\nThe next week, Murphy said he wanted to talk to Holgorsen in the coach\u2019s office. That meeting did not last very long apparently.\n\n\n\n\n\nHolgorsen sat at a desk, eyes glued to a monitor and replied with 13 words. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to talk, I only have time to coach.\u201d and \u201cO.K.\u201d As if I didn\u2019t deserve an eye to eye farewell or a proper handshake. \u2014 Justin Murphy (@JMurphy_73) October 11, 2019\n\nAs a person that is guaranteed a non-salary compensation of S3.4 million to go along with a $300,000 base salary for the 2019 year, one might think you\u2019d have a better outlook on the players that contribute to your compensation. I mean this is a team sport, right? \u2014 Justin Murphy (@JMurphy_73) October 11, 2019\n\nYahoo Sports has reached out to Houston for comment and also to Murphy for further comment on his Thursday night tweets and has yet to hear back from either.\n\nHolgorsen is in his first year coaching at Houston after coming over from West Virginia. He made the uncommon move from a Power Five school to a Group of Five school on his own volition after the 2018 season following Houston\u2019s decision to fire coach Major Applewhite.\n\nThe Cougars beat North Texas to move to 2-3 on the season and were off in Week 6. Houston plays No. 25 Cincinnati on Saturday.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Justin Murphy said that seniors were approached by Holgorsen after the Cougars' loss to Tulane to fall to 1-3 on the season.
