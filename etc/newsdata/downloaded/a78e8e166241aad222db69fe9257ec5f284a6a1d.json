(Jan Gerber/News24)\n\n\"Amandla! Awethu!\" activists of Reclaim the City exclaimed when Western Cape High Court Judge Judith Cloete ruled that an interdict, prohibiting them from protesting at a property owned by Growthpoint Properties, should not be granted.\n\nLast December, a group of around 30 protesters from Reclaim the City, Unite Behind and the Social Justice Coalition occupied a parking lot at the bottom of Loop Street in Cape Town.\n\nThe land is owned by Growthpoint Properties, which it obtained from the City of Cape Town in 2016, at what Reclaim the City claims was a \"discount\".\n\nOn the same day, after an urgent application from Growthpoint Properties, Western Cape High Court Judge Kate Savage granted an interim interdict against the protesters.\n\nThe application was granted ex parte \u2013 meaning not all the parties to the matter were heard. In this case, it was only Growthpoint that was heard, because it was the applicant. The interdict had been extended on several occasions.\n\nThe applicant's advocate, Sean Rosenberg, SC, had previously asked Cloete to confirm the earlier interdict.\n\n'Real purpose of protest'\n\nBut advocate Ria Matsala, who represented Reclaim the City and Unite Behind, argued that this should not be done.\n\nRosenberg argued that \"the occupiers were on site to occupy\" for an undetermined time and that their motivations were immaterial. He said it was private property.\n\nMatsala argued that the applicants \u2013 in their initial application \u2013 failed to state all the material facts before the court and breached the good faith required by an applicant in an ex parte matter.\n\nDelivering her judgment on Friday, Cloete agreed with Matsala.\n\nCloete found that Growthpoint's regional asset manager for the Western Cape, Tim Irvine, did not disclose all the relevant facts to the court in his founding affidavit.\n\n\"What cannot be disputed is that the real purpose of the protest must have been known to Irvine,\" Cloete said.\n\nIn his affidavit, Irvine said the protesters were unknown to him. But, pictures shown in court showed the protesters holding banners with Reclaim the City's logo.\n\n'Did not pose a real threat'\n\nFurthermore, an attorney acting on behalf of the protesters, Jonty Clogger, made contact with Growthpoint's attorney and asked to take instruction from the protesters on the site. This was not reflected in the founding affidavit.\n\nThe previous peaceful protests Reclaim the City held in connection with Growthpoint were also not mentioned in the affidavit.\n\nCloete said that Savage was misled and that she agreed the original application \"breached the duty of utmost good faith\" that an ex parte application requires.\n\nShe said there was clearly no \"dire urgency\".\n\n\"The protest did not pose a real threat to the applicant's property rights,\" Cloete said.\n\n\"The applicant omitted to place all the relevant facts before Savage, J. And these facts are material,\" Cloete said.\n\nShe also pointed out that the respondents \u2013 Reclaim the City and Unite Behind \u2013 undertook that they would not return to the property.\n\nShe discharged the interdict and ordered that Growthpoint pay the costs of the litigation.", "description": "Western Cape High Court Judge Judith Cloete has ruled that an interdict, prohibiting Reclaim the City activists from protesting at a property owned by Growthpoint Properties, should not be granted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9051/620c0179055e43efbb8a17b9fa5f83e5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-28"}
