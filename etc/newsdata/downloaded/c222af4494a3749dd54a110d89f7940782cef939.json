But a bigger part of it is private engagement with regulators around the world, and those, I think, often, are more substantive and less dramatic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd those meetings aren\u2019t being played for the camera, but that\u2019s where a lot of the discussions and details get hashed out on things.\u201d", "description": "Facebook\u2019s plan\u00a0to launch its own cryptocurrency next year is under threat\u00a0after key partners shed doubt on the project.
