It was under this immunity that the Sacoolas family was allowed to leave the UK amid police investigations.\n\nThe UK had repeatedly asked the US Embassy in London to waive Anne Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity, but the US refused, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the Dunn family on Saturday, according to the BBC.\n\nRaab on Saturday also cancelled Anne Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity, saying it \"is no longer relevant ... because she has returned home.\" He added that the US said \"they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\"\n\nThis means that if Sacoolas returned to the UK, she could face court proceedings and prosecution.
