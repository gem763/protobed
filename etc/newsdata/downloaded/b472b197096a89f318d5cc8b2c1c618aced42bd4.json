Thank you very much, Shanghai will always be a special place in my heart.\u201d\n\nZverev, long touted as the best of the new generation of men\u2019s tennis stars, was error-prone but had no complaints.\n\n\u201cAs I said yesterday, you are probably the best player in the world right now,\u201d the world number six told Medvedev.\n\n\u201cHow you are playing is unbelievable.\u201d\n\nMedvedev made a fast start, winning his service game and then breaking Zverev\u2019s for an early 2-0 lead.\n\nUnder a closed stadium roof because of rain in Shanghai, Zverev was suffocating, down 3-0 after 11 minutes.\n\nBut the German sent down an ace to finally get a foothold in the match and then broke back for 3-2.\n\nThe duo went with serve until Zverev conceded the set with two calamitous double faults on the trot, the last of which he transpired to gift with a horribly mis-hit second serve that drew a few giggles from the crowd.\n\nThe second set began in the same way as the first \u2014 Medvedev breaking Zverev\u2019s first service game for a prompt 2-0 lead.\n\nHe then broke once more in the fourth for a dominant victory and sealed the title with an ace \u2014 and the most subtle of smiles.\n\nThe next generation has stamped its authority on Shanghai with Djokovic and Federer \u2014 beaten by Zverev \u2014 both going out in the quarter-finals.\n\nNadal failed to play because of a wrist injury.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Daniil Medvedev won his fourth title of a spectacular year with a thumping 6-4, 6-1 victory over Alexander Zverev in the Shanghai Masters final on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Zer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
