As a result, even legitimate researchers at labs and universities across the country must wade through restrictions on the clinical trials they run, which marijuana they can use and how it is shipped and stored.\n\nThis means states that have legalized cannabis for adult use are doing so in an information vacuum, with less understanding of what it is and what it does than virtually any nutritional supplement currently on the market, and with far less information than they have on legal substances that are easily abused, such as alcohol or tobacco. Law enforcement officers don\u2019t even know at what point it is unsafe for marijuana users to drive.\n\n\u201cWe suddenly have this huge influx of people who are able to buy cannabis, able to use it in all its various formulations,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cAnd we know nothing.\u201d\n\nThe questions they and members of their 20-member research team want to answer are far-ranging.", "description": "", "authors": ["Sarah Owermohle", "Politico.Com Agenda Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
