In a motion filed last night, Rad and Pambakian call former Tinder CEO Greg Blatt\u2019s defamation suit \u201cabusive\u201d and a \u201cpublic smear campaign against a sexual assault accuser under cover of a court proceeding.\u201d Their legal team is seeking the case be dismissed under California\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute, which protects free speech in connection with a public issue.\n\nBlatt sued Pambakian and Rad for defamation after they went public with claims that Blatt sexually harassed Pambakian after a 2016 Tinder holiday party. Pambakian says Blatt groped her breasts and upper thighs and kissed her shoulders, neck, and chest, but Blatt maintains that the interaction was consensual and that their \u201cfully-clothed bodies were in contact\u201d when they allegedly kissed. The sexual assault allegations first surfaced in a separate valuation lawsuit in which Rad and others are seeking $1 billion over claims that parent companies Match Group and IAC purposely undervalued Tinder in an effort to avoid paying millions in stock options.\n\nPambakian was initially part of that lawsuit, but she had to drop out because she signed an arbitration agreement that was included in her employment contract. She later filed a lawsuit against Match Group over sexual assault and wrongful termination because the company ended her employment at Tinder in December 2018.\n\nPambakian and Rad\u2019s legal team is now arguing that Blatt\u2019s cited defamation examples, including a piece on The Verge and on CNN, are protected speech and relevant to the valuation lawsuit.\n\nSeparately, Blatt is also asking the court to handle his claims against Pambakian in arbitration because of an employment contract she signed with Match Group. In their anti-SLAPP motion, the defendants point out that Blatt filed this lawsuit in court, even though he is now requesting it be made private. The motion says his defamation suit \u201cserved his media objectives\u201d and suggests that\u2019s why Blatt is now asking it to be taken out of public proceedings. In addition to having the lawsuit dismissed, Pambakian and Rad also want their attorney fees covered.", "description": "Tinder co-founder Sean Rad and former Tinder VP of communications Rosette Pambakian are asking the court to dismiss a defamation suit against them filed by former Tinder CEO Greg Blatt.", "authors": ["Ashley Carman", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/74tRpKCSv5uFlBQF2t_BsTA4rlA=/0x216:3000x1787/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19270001/498035418.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
