Last October, he almost succeeded in killing off Joe Tate with a single punch \u2013 so imagine what he will have in store for Nate Robinson (Jurell Carter) when he finds out that he has been sleeping with Moira (Natalie J Robb).\n\nAs the affair comes to light \u2013 thanks to the catalyst that is Faith \u2013 a devastating series of events is set to take place. And while we are sworn to secrecy over what fans can expect, Sally all but confirmed that it would be a matter of life and death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about the events at the recent Inside Soap Awards, the popular star told The Mirror: \u2018Faith\u2019s not happy about it at all. She\u2019s got a bee in her bonnet because anything to do with Cain is utter important \u2013 she adds two and two and makes 49.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018There is a very shocking twist with Nate\u2019s identity and it has dire consequences for my son Cain, for Moira my daughter-in-law, and me. We have to come through a heavy storm and some of us might not make it. It was some of the most harrowingly emotional scenes I\u2019ve ever done.\u2019\n\nSounds massive and unmissable. But one thing that it leads to is a departure for Sally as Faith.\n\nShe added to Metro.co.uk: \u2018It\u2019s going to be an explosive October. I may have to leave for a little while.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The star has hinted at a shocking death.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nate-cain-moira-emmerdale-b9ea_1570549121.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
