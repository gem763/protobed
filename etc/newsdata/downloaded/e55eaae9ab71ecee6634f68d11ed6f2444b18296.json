In December, the news broke that the network paid Dushku a whopping $9.5 million following allegations that Weatherly sexually harassed her numerous times on set.\n\nDushku appeared in the legal drama for three episodes in 2017 at the end of its first season, though she was expected to become a regular cast member in the second season. However, her character was written off after she issued a sexual harassment complaint against Weatherly. In a first-person article for The Boston Globe, she wrote, \u201cI took a job and, because I did not want to be harassed, I was fired.\u201d\n\nThe Bring It On actress accused her Bull costar of repeatedly making lewd comments about her appearance and saying he wanted to have a threesome with her. In one particularly disturbing incident, Dushku alleges that she incorrectly delivered a line, prompting Weatherly to shout at her, \u201cI will take you over my knee and spank you like a little girl.\u201d She says the incident was captured on tape. According to Dushku, Weatherly campaigned for her to be fired (he denies this) and trivialized her complaint as resulting from a \u201chumor deficit.\u201d Because of course Dushku\u2019s sense of humor is really the problem in this situation.\n\nIn the trenchant Boston Globe piece, Dushku describes the lingering, demoralizing experience of being the victim of workplace harassment. \u201cWhat is hardest to share is the way [Weatherly] made me feel for 10 to 12 hours per day for weeks,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was classic workplace harassment that became workplace bullying. I was made to feel dread nearly all the time I was in his presence. And this dread continues to come up whenever I think of him and that experience.\u201d\n\nAs part of the settlement agreement, Dushku ordered CBS to hire a sexual harassment expert to oversee Weatherly\u2019s conduct on set. The $9.5 million represents a portion of what she would have made in a typical six-season run as a series regular. The news of the accusations against Weatherly and the bombshell settlement with Dushku came at a time when CBS was already under immense pressure due to allegations of sexual misconduct against disgraced CEO Les Moonves. In May, however, it was announced that Bull had been renewed for a fourth season, and the explanation for the renewal offered by CBS was disappointing, to say the least.\n\nOn a press tour in early August, CBS chief of entertainment Kelly Kahl explained, \u201cWhat we found was in Michael\u2019s case no complaints, incidents, during his time [on NCIS].\u201d Kahl added that the actor was \u201cremorseful and apologetic\u201d about the sexual harassment controversy. Setting aside how Weatherly\u2019s treatment of anyone on the set of his previous show is completely irrelevant to his harassment of Dushku, the real explanation behind Bull\u2019s renewal can likely be reduced to a financially motivated business decision.\n\nThe procedural show has consistently strong ratings, ranking as the 16th most popular TV show in total viewers last year with 11.35 million. In his press tour address, Kahl described Bull as \u201ca show that does very well.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a popular show,\u201d he said. \u201cMichael is loved by our audience. Even after the allegations came out, people continued to watch.\u201d\n\nThough CBS was unwilling to cut ties with Weatherly in the wake of the controversy, Bull\u2019s high-profile executive producer walked away from the project upon the announcement that it would be getting a fourth season. Steven Spielberg, who served as EP throughout the first three seasons, left the show nearly six months after news of the settlement was made public.\n\nA rep for Spielberg\u2019s production company, Amblin Television, told The New York Times in May, \u201cWe can confirm that we are no longer associated with the show.\u201d\n\nWhile Spielberg and Amblin Television declined to comment further, the Academy Award-winning filmmaker is known to be a vocal supporter of the Time\u2019s Up movement.", "description": "The series\u2019 fourth season premieres Monday\u2014after it was revealed that CBS settled with actress Eliza Dushku over sexual harassment allegations against its star Michael Weatherly.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569210310/190922-julian-bull-tease-2_ddjtxl", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
