And Stash allows users to automatically save and invest spare change when they make use of a Stash debit card and make purchases through the tool.\n\nCo-founder Brandon Krieg told CBSN the company is on a mission to break down barriers to investment and give everyone a chance to grow their savings. \"Ultimately, we are helping our clients live a better financial life,\" he said.\n\nHigh minimum investments are among the biggest barriers to entry for non-investors.\n\n\"If someone really wants to start investing, and it's Amazon they want to start with, it's over $1,000 a share. That's completely out of touch. So when we started the company, we built a fractional investing platform so people can buy fractions of stock, and we made the minimum $5,\" Krieg said.\n\nCustomers who sign up for a Stash debit card can invest while they shop at their favorite establishments.\n\n\"So if we go to Chipotle and put the card in the machine, the second we pay, we become a Chipotle shareholder,\" Krieg said.\n\nThis way, customers build investment portfolios \"that look like them and highly reflect the way they live their life,\" he added.\n\nAt the end of the day, this co-founder believes that no matter how good an idea he might have, his customers always know best. \"You just have to listen to them,\" he said.", "description": "The app lets customers invest in stocks like Apple and Chipotle by eliminating high minimums for stock purchases", "authors": ["Megan Cerullo"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/29/6937dc91-6f17-41a5-b778-2ed040435898/thumbnail/1200x630/051cf41b2d1666e29f594c91e52d54e4/screen-shot-2019-10-29-at-4-11-50-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
