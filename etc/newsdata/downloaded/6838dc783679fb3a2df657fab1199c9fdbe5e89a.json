The Diamondbacks have won four of their last six games after losing six straight.\n\nKelly (12-14) was impressive in his final road start this season. He held the Padres to two hits and struck out nine while walking three.\n\nSan Diego had only two baserunners in the first four innings, one of whom was erased by a double play. The Padres didn\u2019t get their first hit until Luis Ur\u00edas singled with two outs in the fifth.\n\n\u201cHe was really pounding the zone with an assortment of pitches and looked very comfortable,\u201d manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cMike (pitching coach Mike Butcher) and I started talking about no-hit stuff. That\u2019s what it looked like to us. I know he pitched halfway through this game with a no-hitter. That wasn\u2019t by accident. It was a very good night for him.\u201d\n\nKelly has thrown seven innings in consecutive starts and in three of his last four. He\u2019s gotten the win in three of his last four starts and in five of his last eight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay consistent,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWith us sliding a little bit after New York, and us trying to make a push for the last wild-card spot, my goal is to go out and be as consistent as I can.\u201d\n\nSaid Lovullo: \u201cI think he\u2019s on that wave a lot of players look for and he\u2019s executing at a pretty high level. Merrill\u2019s definitely on a good roll right now.\u201d\n\nThe Padres made plenty of mistakes as they lost for the eighth time in nine games. First baseman Eric Hosmer committed two errors, and he and rookie Josh Naylor each struck out three times.\n\nThe damage in the eighth could have been less if Manny Machado had tagged Adam Jones advancing to third on Carson Kelly\u2019s one-out grounder and the Diamondbacks up 3-0. Jones ran out of the baseline, but Machado didn\u2019t attempt to tag him, so he was safe.\n\n\u201cI think he saw him go wide out of the baseline; he assumed he was out,\u201d manager Andy Green said. \u201cIf there\u2019s no guy trying to tag you, you\u2019re allowed to round it as far out as you want to. That was a tough play not to end up with an out.\u201d\n\nSaid Hosmer: \u201cWe\u2019re just making a lot of mistakes out there. \u201cIt\u2019s tough when things aren\u2019t going right. It seems like it just keeps pouring on us a little bit. We\u2019re better than what we\u2019re showing right now. It starts with me going out there, not playing well defensively right now obviously.\u201d\n\nKelly got all the runs he needed when Carson Kelly hit a two-run single in the second off left-hander Eric Lauer.\n\nThe Diamondbacks sent 12 batters to the plate in the eighth and scored seven runs during a Padres\u2019 bullpen meltdown. The Diamondbacks had four hits, drew three walks and had one hit batsman. Besides Rojas\u2019 bases-clearing double, Wilmer Flores hit a two-run single, Jones had an RBI single and pinch-hitter Abraham Almonte drew a bases-loaded walk.\n\nLauer (8-10) also struck out nine but allowed two runs and two hits in six innings, with four walks.\n\nNICE PLAY\n\nMerrill Kelly snagged Manny Machado\u2019s line drive in the first inning and doubled Nick Martini off first to end the inning.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call that athleticism or luck,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI just tried to move my head and put the glove where my head was, and the ball just happened to find my glove.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Luke Weaver (4-3, 3.03) is scheduled to start Saturday night.\n\nPadres: Struggling rookie RHP Cal Quantrill (6-8, 5.33) is scheduled to make his 23rd appearance and 18th start. He is 0-4 with a 15.12 ERA in his last four starts since Aug. 27\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Merrill Kelly is putting a strong finish on his rookie season with the Arizona Diamondbacks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/diamondbacks_padres_baseball_79185_c0-222-3905-2498_s1770x1032.jpg?b6735318f4801eb5253ce5766306d9b01919b39d", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
