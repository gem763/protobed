Tebas initially suggested reversing this season's Clasicos, and playing at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu instead this weekend, with the return next March at the Camp Nou. The Royal Spanish Football Federation [RFEF] quickly said the sequence of fixtures could not be changed, however, they accepted that the game could not be played as scheduled.\n\nClearly neither Madrid-based LaLiga, nor the RFEF, wanted Spain\u2019s showpiece game to be dominated by the current political situation in Catalonia. Specifically, there was a fear that the [claimed] global TV audience of 500 million would be swayed by watching a stadium filled with red and yellow Catalan senyera flags chanting \u2018independencia\u2019. The authorities knew it would be embarrassing and disruptive for the teams and their supporters to move the game. But for conservative Spanish nationalists, the possible propaganda victory for the 'other side' was even worse.\n\nBarca\u2019s club statutes mandate \u201cloyalty to Catalonia\u201d, and as an institution it has generally publicly supported the Catalan people\u2019s right to self-determination. As soon as the nine politicians were jailed last week, the club released a strongly worded statement saying that \u201cprison is not the solution\u201d to the political crisis while also making a reasonable sounding call for \u201call political leaders to lead a process of dialogue and negotiation to resolve this conflict.\u201d\n\nInfluential blaugrana figures Pep Guardiola and Xavi Hernandez more severely criticised the court decision and Madrid government generally, which raised hackles among Spanish nationalists, perhaps including those high in the footballing hierarchy. The way the issue became framed - especially by some right-wing politicians and prominent conservative media figures - was that going ahead with the game this weekend would have been a \u2018defeat\u2019 to Pep and Xavi.\n\nHowever the idea that everybody at Barca is an \u2018independentista\u2019 and therefore \u2018anti-Spanish\u2019 is just plain wrong. There is a wide range of opinion among players, directors and supporters, including those born in Catalonia, Spain and elsewhere. Even Gerard Pique - the most high profile target of anger from nationalist Spaniards - has always been careful to give a nuanced view of the situation. Barca\u2019s board also have to balance the different views within their fanbase and commercial partners.\n\nThe situation is not dissimilar to when Barca played Las Palmas behind closed doors at the Camp Nou on 1 October 2017 - the day of the proposed referendum on Catalan independence, which led directly to last week\u2019s jailing of some of the organisers. However the Clasico is different, and on Friday the blaugrana board accepted that it could not be played this week, and themselves suggested December 18 instead. In an uncommon show of solidarity with their rivals, Madrid also agreed.\n\nThat seemed to be that \u2013 with the RFEF's Competition Committee expected to rubber-stamp the new date at a meeting on Monday in Madrid. However La Liga objected to playing their highest profile fixture on a midweek evening close to Christmas, as that would hurt the intention to use the game to promote Spanish football in the Far East.\n\n\u201cSpanish football loses value, in every sense, not just financial, but of presence in Asia,\u201d Tebas told ABC over the weekend. \u201cAll the TV operators know it. The agreement signed was for the first Clasico of the season to be orientated towards the Asian market. That was why it was played on a Saturday at 1PM [local time]. If it is played on Wednesday night in Spain, Asia is asleep.\u201d\n\nAnother irony of the situation is that the league\u2019s main broadcast partner is Catalan company Mediapro, whose Barcelona-born boss Jaume Raures is a close business associate of Tebas despite their very different political views.\n\nLa Liga's presentation to the Competition Committee, on which sit three supposedly independent legal experts, pointed out that there are Copa del Rey games already scheduled for December 18, and RFEF rules forbid two competitions being played on the same date. FIFA's Club World Cup semi-final involving Liverpool is also being played in Qatar that Wednesday, a further issue for TV audiences and the all important global commercial partners.\n\nLa Liga's preferred date is Saturday December 7, which would mean rescheduling games originally set for that weekend when Madrid and Barca are due to play Espanyol and Mallorca. Wednesday December 4 could emerge as a 'compromise' date, although that would not be ideal for the Asian market either. The committee is due to meet again on Tuesday evening, but a final decision may be pushed further back.\n\nMeanwhile, the Clasico is not the only big Spanish game currently up in the air. Recent days also saw La Liga propose that early December\u2019s Villarreal versus Atletico Madrid fixture be played in Miami. That means another battle with other football authorities inside and outside Spain, which Tebas' side eventually lost when trying to move Barcelona against Girona to Florida last season.\n\nAnd the venue for this season\u2019s Spanish Supercopa, due to be contested by four teams next January, is also yet to be decided as RFEF president Luis Rubiales' initial choice of Saudi Arabia as venue ran into problems.\n\nThe Clasico overshadows all of these, and its rescheduling has just drawn attention to Spain's unique mix of football and politics.\n\n\u201cThis change of day and hour is going to hurt all of Spanish football,\u201d Tebas said over the weekend.\n\nThe shame is that moving the game was not really necessary at all.", "description": "This weekend's La Liga Clasico was postponed for political reasons by football people, who are now suffering the financial implications of their unnecessary decision.
