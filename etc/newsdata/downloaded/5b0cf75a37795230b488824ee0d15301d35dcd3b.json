Baghdadi, Trump said, \"died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\"\n\nThat was only the first of a number of insults Trump lobbed at Baghdadi and the Islamic State during his speech. But while some are condemning the president's rhetoric, I believe it was both morally justified and strategically valuable.\n\nAlthough it might appear that Trump was resorting to standard-fare rhetorical excesses, the president seems to have intended his words to carry a broader strategic effect here. Note, for example, Trump's repeated focus on dogs, an animal regarded by most Islamic teachings as unclean and unworthy of companionship. Describing Baghdadi's desperate attempt to escape, Trump noted how \"our dogs chased him down.\" Trump later observed that many ISIS fighters are \"very frightened puppies\" and concluded by saying that Baghdadi \"died like a dog \u2014 he died like a coward.\"\n\nThis canine focus is extremely odd unless it is intentional, which I suspect it is. And that would be a good thing. ISIS presents itself as the holiest citadel of warriors, as a group serving God's pure and ordained will on Earth. But when the leader of ISIS's most hated adversary mocks its deceased caliph (emperor) as a fool who ran into a dead-end tunnel while being chased by lowly dogs, it erodes ISIS's credibility. It underscores how the organization, which at one point nearly qualified for its own seat at the United Nations, is now perceived as a sad joke.\n\nHopefully, that sad joke will persuade individuals otherwise susceptible to ISIS propaganda to reconsider the group's appeal. How can they be God's warriors if they are such an embarrassing lot of cowards? Trump is basically illustrating that ISIS isn't a highway to heaven; it's a dead end to an embarrassingly submissive demise. This visceral annihilation of ISIS's domination fetish \u2014 whether of people, territory, or religion \u2014 to the bark of a dog is striking.\n\nOf course, Trump's words also serve another purpose: They make us smile. As the president stated in conclusion, \"The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.\"\n\nBaghdadi chose his enemies poorly. Now, similar to Jihadi John, he's in many different pieces.", "description": "Announcing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi's death, President Trump didn't hold back on Sunday.
