They\u2019re also found naturally in meat and dairy.\n\nVisit INSIDER\u2019s homepage for more.\n\nTrans fatty acids, a type of unsaturated fat often used in food processing and added to fried food, snacks, and pastries, have long been associated with \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, heart disease, and other health problems.\n\nThere\u2019s now evidence to suggest that they\u2019re also linked to Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia, according to research published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.\n\nResearchers from Kyushu University, Kobe University, and Nakamura-Gakuen University in Japan tracked 1,628 elderly Japanese residents without dementia for 10 years, including by taking blood samples and analyzing their diets.\n\nThey found that those with the highest levels of trans fats in their blood were 52% to 75% more likely to develop dementia than people with the lowest levels of trans fats. This was the case even after adjusting for other dietary and lifestyle factors, including total calorie intake and consumption of other types of fats.\n\nThe researchers also pinpointed sweet pastries as the strongest contributor to higher trans fats levels in the blood, followed by margarine.\n\n\u201cThis study is important as it builds upon prior evidence that dietary intake of trans fats can increase risk of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia,\u201d neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, told CNN. Isaacson wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\ncaption Sweet pastries were the strongest contributor to higher trans fat levels in the blood, according to the study.

The World Health Organization has plans to eliminate trans fats from foods worldwide by 2023.\n\nBut some foods like margarine, cookies, snacks, and other processed foods still contain artficial trans fats since the FDA extended the deadline to June 2019 to allow companies to reformulate their products. Those items containing trans fats can still be sold until January 2021, according to the FDA.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, the small amounts still allowed in foods can really add up if people eat multiple servings of these foods, and trans fats are still allowed in many other countries,\u201d study author Dr. Toshiharu Ninomiya, a professor at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, said in a statement.\n\nOther foods, such as meat and dairy, naturally contain some trans fats. Beef, lamb, cheese, and butterfat contain small amounts of trans fats, but it\u2019s not clear if these are as bad for cholesterol levels as artificial trans fats, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nThe association recommends avoiding trans fat as much as possible. To start, be wary of items containing hydrogenated vegetable oils, a common source of trans fat.\n\nRead more:\n\nSome doctors say women should avoid cheese due to its link to breast cancer\n\nNew dietary guidelines suggest people should keep eating red meat and processed meat, but nutrition experts says the report is irresponsible\n\nThere\u2019s nothing dangerous about high-fructose corn syrup.
