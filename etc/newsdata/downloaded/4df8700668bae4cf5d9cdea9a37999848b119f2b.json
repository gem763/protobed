Security forces responded with a crackdown on the spontaneous rallies of demonstrators demanding jobs, better services and an end to endemic corruption in the oil-rich country.\n\nIn the first official statement from the government accounting for the violence, Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan said Sunday that 104 people had been killed in the six days of unrest, including eight members of the security forces, and more than 6,000 wounded. He said an investigation was under way to determine who was behind the most deadly day of violence, in Baghdad on Friday.\n\nThe unrest is the most serious challenge facing Iraq two years after the victory against Islamic State militants. The chaos also comes at a critical time for the government, which has been caught in the middle of increasing U.S.-Iran tensions in the region. Iraq is allied with both countries and hosts thousands of U.S. troops, as well as powerful paramilitary forces allied with Iran.\n\nIraq\u2019s most senior Shiite spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has urged the protesters and the security forces to end the violence while the country\u2019s prime minister has called on the protesters to go home. Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi also pledged to meet with the protesters wherever they are and without any armed forces, to hear their demands.\n\nAbdul-Mahdi defended the security forces, saying they were carrying out their duties and would only use force in extreme cases of self-defense.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t accept the continuation of the situation like this,\u201d Abdul-Mahdi told his Cabinet late Saturday in televised remarks. \u201cWe hear of snipers, firebombs, burning a policeman, a citizen.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Sunday, Maan, the Interior Ministry spokesman, said protesters have burned 51 public buildings and eight political party headquarters. He claimed security forces didn\u2019t confront the protesters, adding that \u201cmalicious hands\u201d were behind targeting protesters and security members alike.\n\nThat contradicted accounts from demonstrators and journalists at the scene who have said they witnessed security forces firing on demonstrators. Some protesters said snipers also took part in breaking up the protests. Maan said most of those killed Friday were hit in the head and heart.\n\nOfficials had said earlier there were attempts at \u201csedition\u201d from snipers who targeted security and protesters alike. They didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nLate Saturday, the prime minister announced a number of measures designed to appease the protesters, including paying out unemployment benefits and providing subsidized housing and land for low-income groups.\n\nStill, demonstrators took to the streets again Sunday\u2014 although in smaller numbers. Hundreds gathered on side streets near Sadr City, a Baghdad suburb, some four kilometers (2.5 miles) from Tahrir Square, which has been the destination of the weeklong rallies, although authorities have prevented protesters from reaching it.\n\nA medical official in a local hospital and a security official said 12 protesters were killed and more than 50 others wounded as they repeatedly tried to break through a security cordon to head to the city center. The officials, who did not provide details, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.\n\nSecurity forces have beefed up their presence in central Baghdad, deploying as far as Sadr City to seal off Tahrir Square.\n\nArmy troops blocked a main road Sunday to prevent the protesters from advancing, then fired on them to push them back. After about an hour, there was more intense gunfire, with soldiers firing over the heads of protesters as they tried to advance.\n\nDucking in reaction to the fire, some protesters piled over one another trying to hide behind the wall of a nearby water fountain. One protester carrying a drum chanted \u201cpeaceful, peaceful,\u201d as others joined in. As the gunfire continued, protesters set tires on fire.\n\nSome demonstrators arrived in rickshaws, which have been used to carry the wounded from the bloody clashes.\n\nThe U.N. envoy for Iraq appealed for an end to the violence and called for holding to account those responsible. \u201cThis must stop. I call on all parties to pause and reflect,\u201d Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert tweeted Saturday night.\n\nMeanwhile, Abdul-Mahdi pledged to meet with the demonstrators to hear their demands.\n\n\u201cI am ready to go wherever our brotherly protesters are and meet them or send them envoys to other locations without any armed forces,\u201d he said late Saturday. \u201cI will go and meet them without weapons and sit with them for hours to listen to their demands.\u201d\n\nHe also decreed that those killed in the protests, whether demonstrators or security forces, would be considered \u201cmartyrs\u201d eligible for state benefits.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Baghdad\u2019s streets had been mostly quiet and traffic thin as an eerie calm prevailed. Students made it to schools and government employees returned to work. But burnt tires and debris littered thoroughfares while security remained heavily deployed in many neighborhoods.\n\nAtheer Assem, a pizza restaurant owner, said he was able to shop Sunday, the start of the working week, for ingredients for his baked goods. But he said his clients have stopped coming to his shop because of the violence, even though it is in a neighborhood that has not witnessed any protests.\n\n\u201cThe protests are making people afraid to go out,\u201d he said, estimating his sales to have dropped by 70 percent.", "description": "BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Twelve anti-government demonstrators were killed Sunday in ongoing protests in the capital Baghdad, the latest fatalities in six days of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/06/823a43_iraq-protests-51119-iraqi-army-troops-deploy-site-protests-in-baghdad-iraq-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
