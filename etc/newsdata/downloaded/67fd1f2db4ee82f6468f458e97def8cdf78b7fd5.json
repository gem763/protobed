But that's due to population growth \u2014 and not something that Trump can credit to any his policies.\n\nThe big question is whether a greater percentage of women is working or searching for a job than at any point in history. And on this count, women have enjoyed better times.\n\nWomen's labour force participation rate right now is 57.5%, according to the Labour Department. The rate has ticked up recently, but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60%.\n\nENERGY\n\nTRUMP, in prepared excerpts: \"We have unleashed a revolution in American energy - the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: True, if \"we\" means Trump and his recent predecessors. It's not all to Trump's credit. The government says the US became the world's top natural gas producer in 2013, under Barack Obama's administration.\n\nThe US now leads the world in oil production, too, under Trump. That's largely because of a boom in production from shale oil, which also began under Obama.", "description": "AP FACT CHECK: Trump's State of the Union statements under scrutiny.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6906/2df4f96f3cb64e0aafd9d5a191348332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-06"}
