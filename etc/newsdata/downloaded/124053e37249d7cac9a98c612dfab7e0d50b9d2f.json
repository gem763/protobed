Yes, but it will be optics at best,\" said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. \"I don't expect anything that happens before the elections to be a comprehensive deal.\"\n\n\"Investors are generally ignoring a plethora of risks... One of the reasons they are willing to do that is foreign investors need a place to go and on a relative basis the United States is still sort of the best house in a bad global neighborhood.\"\n\nMarkets this week have been particularly vulnerable to headlines on Sino-U.S. trade talks and political ructions in Washington, before the start of third quarter corporate earnings.\n\nFutures were little changed after data showed U.S. consumer spending barely rose in August, suggesting that the economy's main growth engine was slowing after accelerating sharply in the second quarter.\n\nNew orders for key U.S.-made capital goods also unexpectedly fell in August, but the so-called core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose to 1.8% in August, the biggest rise in prices since January.\n\nA University of Michigan survey on consumer sentiment is expected at 10:00 a.m. ET.\n\nMicron Technology Inc tumbled 5.1% premarket as it forecast first-quarter profit below Wall Street targets, saying it was \"mindful\" of economic and trade uncertainty even though there were signs of an uptick in memory chip demand.\n\nOther semiconductor companies Advanced Micro Devices Inc , Nvidia Corp dropped about 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively.\n\nAt 8:54 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 48 points, or 0.18%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 7 points, or 0.23% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 14.5 points, or 0.19%.
