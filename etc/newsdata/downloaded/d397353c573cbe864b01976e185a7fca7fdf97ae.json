He makes, must be, 400 mistimed challenges a match, he essentially gets booked every single time I watch him.\n\n'He doesn't seem to set the tone for the rest of his team-mates with his performance levels. So what happened on Sunday doesn't surprise me because ill-discipline, he has been riddled with it.'\n\nThe Arsenal skipper cupped his hand to his ear as he was hauled off in the second half\n\nXhaka proceeded to take off his shirt before heading down the tunnel and told fans to 'f*** off'\n\nThe club are yet to conclude whether the Swiss international will be stripped of the captaincy following his antagonistic remarks towards the fans.\n\nXhaka is not part of the squad that will take on Liverpool in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday as scrutiny over his position continues until he is next involved.\n\nBut for Neville, the bigger issue is his inability to develop his game and 'set the tone' for a side brimming with young talents.\n\n'He does give it all, he is committed, there is no doubt about that.,' the former Manchester United full-backs added.\n\n'But he is the least experienced experienced player I have ever watched. He is rash and I don't know why he doesn't pick up on this. I don't have a problem with this idea of taking on your fans, a bit of tension. It is never great, not healthy but in football that can happen.\n\n'Ultimately it is very difficult for him to continue to wear the armband. I think it would be very difficult to patch it up quickly with (the fans), he would have to apologise to them heavily.'\n\nXhaka is 'the least experienced experienced player I have ever watched' in Neville's opinion\n\nIt is yet to be determined whether the Swiss midfielder will be stripped of the captaincy\n\nEmery was quizzed at length on Xhaka's conduct ahead of the game against Liverpool and the Spaniard feels that his player will need to apologise to win the fans over again.\n\nHe said: 'Yes (he needs to apologise). I think when we make individual mistakes, we need to make apologies for the circumstances. I prefer to do that. We suggest to him to do it.'\n\nAsked if the midfielder is still the right man to captain Arsenal, Emery added: 'I explained why I decided that. He has the values, he has the respect in the dressing room, he has experience and he is captain of his national team.\n\n'He has the conditions to be the captain. I decided that and the players respect that. He was wrong on Sunday and he also got wrong the response on Sunday, as a captain.'", "description": "Neville (left) says Xhaka (right) is 'riddled with ill-discipline' and he has put himself in a position where it is difficult to remain captain having told Arsenal fans to 'f*** off'  draw with Crystal Palace.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/14/20378500-0-image-a-69_1572444046948.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
