Inslee made climate change the top priority of his short-lived campaign.\n\n\u201cWe need the ex-chemical company executives to be gone,\u201d Williamson said, referring to the left\u2019s opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to reverse unnecessary regulations on U.S. businesses put in place during the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cWe need the ex-lobbyists for the oil companies to be gone and the EPA to be a magnet for world-class environmental science,\u201d Williamson said.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation where if we do not act, and quite radically I must say, within the next 12 years we could have within the next 15 or 20 years a level of social collapse unseen in the modern era,\u201d Williamson said.\n\n\u201cWe could be on the way to a situation in which whole swaths of countries, possibly even whole swaths of continents are uninhabitable because of the heat,\u201d Williamson said.\n\n\u201cThen that means, of course, that food cannot be grown there,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cIt means economic collapse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means massive food shortages,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAnd means levels that could possibly be up to hundreds of millions of environmental refugees,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cRight now we already have a terrible environmental crisis \u2014 over 63 million people that have been displaced.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think there\u2019s a refugee crisis now, just wait to see what would happen then,\u201d Williamson said.\n\n\u201cWe need nothing short of a World War II level mass mobilization to reverse climate change,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nWilliamson is a best-selling author who gained fame for her self-help, motivational speaking and as a spiritual adviser to celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "Presidential hopeful Marianne Williamson said on Thursday that a World War II level of mobilization is needed to fight climate change.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/DSC_3488-e1571954087123-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
