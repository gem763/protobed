With just hundreds left, Palani Mohan\u2019s images capture them as they disappear.\n\nAlmost all of the pullers originate from the state of Bihar, one of India\u2019s poorest. They come here looking for work, leaving their families behind in the villages. It\u2019s a hard and lonely existence, and one that is slowly dying out. The government of West Bengal state has described the jobs of the rickshaw pullers as \u2018barbaric\u2019, \u2018despicable\u2019 and \u2018inhuman\u2019. There is no place in the world today, it says, for \u2018human horses\u2019. Men with bare feet pulling others for 18 hours a day in the heat and the rain, for just a few rupees. But the city\u2019s residents disagree", "description": "Kolkata, one of Asia\u2019s great melting pots, is the last place on Earth where rickshaw wallahs still haul people and goods through narrow lanes.
