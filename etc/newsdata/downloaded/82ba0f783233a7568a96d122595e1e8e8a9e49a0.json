In the hours outside the ban, anyone working outdoors is still being exposed to potentially fatal levels of heat stress between June and September, which cardiologists say is leading to high numbers of fatalities every year.\n\nOur analysis also found dangerous levels of heat exposure continues into the cooler months.\n\nDoha is currently hosting the World Athletics Championships, with athletes and sports professionals describing extreme heat conditions over the weekend. Yet outside of the air-conditioned stadiums, workers remain at risk of serious harm from heat stress between 9am and 12 noon throughout October.\n\nWorking in high temperatures puts a huge strain on the human cardiovascular system, with extreme heat stress leading to fatal heart attacks and other cardiovascular fatalities, recent research has shown.\n\nEvery year hundreds of workers \u2013 many young men between 25 and 35 years old \u2013 die while working in Qatar. The majority of these deaths are attributed to cardiovascular causes or \u201cnatural death\u201d by the Qatari authorities.\n\nYet recent research published in the Cardiology Journal by a group of leading climatologists and cardiologists concluded that the deaths were likely to be caused by heatstroke, exploring the correlation between the deaths of 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017, and rising temperatures.\n\nThe research found that in the cooler months about 22% of deaths year-on-year were attributed to heart attacks, cardiac arrest or other cardio-related causes by the Qatari authorities. In the summer months this spiked to 58%.\n\n\u201cFrom our research it was clear that workers are being recruited in their home countries partly on the basis of their health and are arriving in the Gulf fit for work,\u201d said Dr Dan Atar, professor of cardiology and head of research at Oslo University Hospital, who co-authored the research into cardiovascular deaths and heat stress.\n\nIn one minute I'm soaked in sweat Nepali construction worker\n\n\u201cYoung men have a very low incidence of heart attacks yet hundreds of them are dying every year in Qatar attributed to cardiovascular causes. The clear conclusion that I draw from this as a cardiologist is that these deaths are caused by deadly heatstroke. Their bodies cannot take the heat stress they are being exposed to.\u201d\n\nAtar said that according to the research, as many as 200 of the 571 young men who died of cardiovascular causes between 2009 and 2017 could have been saved if effective heat protection measures had been implemented as part of occupational health and safety programmes.\n\nQatar\u2019s construction boom ahead of the 2022 Fifa World Cup has seen the country\u2019s migrant worker population rise to 1.9m, many of these young men from Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan who travel to the country to build the stadiums, roads and hotels that will service the tournament.\n\nOf the 11 worker fatalities of workers linked to Fifa World Cup stadiums recorded by Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee, the body responsible for workers\u2019 health and safety last year, nine were attributed to sudden heart attacks or respiratory failure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Signs warn of heat stress on a construction site in Doha. Photograph: Pete Pattisson\n\n\u201cWith the World Cup only two years away, the high number of deaths of young men from cardiac arrest in Qatar must be investigated urgently,\u201d said Nick McGeehan, director of Fair/Square Projects, which has conducted research on heat stress and migrant worker rights. \u201cFor years human rights campaigners have been raising the impact of heat stress on worker fatalities and yet the deaths continue.\u201d\n\nIn Doha, a sign outside one construction site warned workers to \u201cBeat the heat\u201d and \u201cQuench your thirst \u2013 safety first\u201d, but a Kenyan labourer dressed in sweat-stained pale blue overalls said there was no clean drinking water on the site. \u201cWhen it\u2019s hot it\u2019s too tough. I\u2019m not used to this climate \u2026 I never liked it since I came here. You feel so much stress,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian this August, migrant workers said they suffered from a range of heat-related conditions, including skin allergies, headaches, altered vision, light-headedness and difficulty breathing. \u201cIn one minute I\u2019m soaked in sweat,\u201d said one Nepali construction worker.\n\nThe Guardian used weather data from 2008-2017 to calculate the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) for Qatar, an internationally used metric that uses wind speed, solar radiation, humidity and air temperature to assess the impact of heat stress on the human body.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A security guards stands in the shade at a five-star hotel in Doha.

Photograph: Pete Pattisson\n\nA WGBT reading of 28C and above is internationally accepted as the point at which the human body is dangerously affected by heat stress.\n\nOur analysis found that:\n\nIn June, before the summer work ban comes into effect on the 15th of the month, it is only safe to work for a maximum of 15 minutes an hour between 9am and 3pm. Some days no work at all can be done without serious risk to workers\u2019 health.\n\nIn July, despite the summer work ban, workers are still exposed to high levels of heat stress between 6am and 3pm, and some days well into the evening. Anyone working outside should have worked a maximum of 15 minutes an hour between 9 and 12.\n\nIn August it is unsafe to work outside in Qatar between 6am and 9pm. According to the WBGT analysis, between 9am and 12 noon outdoor work should be stopped entirely. From 3-6pm, work should only be resumed for 15 minutes an hour to avoid physical harm from the heat.\n\nAfter the outdoor working ban ends on 31 August, it continues to be very dangerous to work outdoors throughout September. Heat stress is a serious risk between 6am and 3pm. Until 19 September, work should be stopped entirely between 9am and 3pm.\n\nAmnesty says migrant workers still being exploited in Qatar Read more\n\nQatar\u2019s Supreme Committee, which is in charge of worker welfare on World Cup sites, said they had put in place a series of measures to mitigate the risk of heat exposure, including requiring contractors to run heat stress management plans and provide temperature and humidity readings during the summer period. This year it said it also provided thousands of workers with cooling towels and cooling vests.\n\nThe Qatari authorities and the Supreme Committee also said it had conducted research with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and climate academics to assess the impact of workplace heat stress on workers, which looked at mitigation measures including on-site cooling rooms and improving rest break schedules.\n\nAs well as the 11.30am-3pm work ban, the Qatari authorities have instructed employers that labourers should not work more than five hours during the summer period.\n\nHowever implementation appears patchy. In Doha this August, as temperatures reached 42C by 11am, migrant workers told the Guardian they were being forced to work in the searing heat for up to 10 hours a day.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A worker rests during the summer midday work ban.

Recent estimates from the ILO and UNDP shows potential losses of up to 10% of annual work hours by 2030 in the hottest countries.\n\n\u201cAs global temperatures rise because of the climate crisis, the health risk posed by heat stress will have devastating health consequences for millions, yet is still not being seen as the emergency that it is,\u201d says Professor Tord Kjellstrom, a consultant on environmental and occupational health for the United Nations and co-author of the Cardiology Journal report. \u201cThis has to change.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Labourers from Nepal put up scaffolding for the launch of the World Cup logo.

Our analysis used the median values for each day and interval.\n\nWet-bulb globe temperature attempts to capture the full effects of heat exposure on human health. The internal heat production \u2013 the physical activity \u2013 should also be considered. Our analysis assumes construction work to be at least \u201cmoderate\u201d intensity, as it is classified in safety standards.\n\nThe thresholds for safe working practices were calculated using the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) guidelines. WBGT readings above 28C were considered to be dangerous for moderate work. Temperatures above this point were assumed to require breaks for 25-75% of working time. At WBGT values above 31.5, any work, regardless of breaks, was considered unsafe.", "description": "As construction boom hits its peak ahead of Fifa World Cup, Guardian analysis shows workers toiling in potentially fatal temperatures", "authors": ["Niamh Mcintyre", "Annie Kelly", "Pete Pattisson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c17cb8cce66bf697694f4f0d174aeaa5e4b70af/0_0_6480_3887/master/6480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50ed659a8ca40bfa20c193455b3cd37b"}
