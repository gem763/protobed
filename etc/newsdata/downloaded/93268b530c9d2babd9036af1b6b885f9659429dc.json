Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, usually a strong Trump supporter, said Monday during an interview with \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \"This to me is just unnerving to its core.\"\n\nPHOTO: Sen.

Turkey considers the Kurdish forces -- the PKK and YPG -- terrorist organizations.\n\nThe news came late Sunday after President Trump spoke to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by phone earlier in the day.\n\nGraham said he\u2019d be introducing a Senate resolution opposing the move.\n\n(MORE: US, Turkey agree to deal on Syria safe zone for refugees as new report warns of ISIS resurgence)\n\n\u201cJust spoke to Sen @ChrisVanHollen about situation in Syria. We will introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria and will call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the U.S. in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate,\u201d he tweeted Monday.\n\n\"Hope and expect sanctions against Turkey - if necessary - would be veto-proof. This decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran, & Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids. Shot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys,\u201d Graham added.\n\nPHOTO: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell arrives at a lectern to speak to reporters following the Republican policy luncheon at the US Capitol in Washington, Sept. 24, 2019.

Major new conflict between Turkey and our partners in Syria would seriously risk damaging Turkey\u2019s ties to the United States and causing greater isolation for Turkey on the world stage,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Monday.\n\n\u201cThis is a terribly unwise decision by the President to abandon our Kurdish allies, who have been our major partner in the fight against the Islamic State,\u201d GOP Sen.
