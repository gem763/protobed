Any advice for a person a year or two out from retirement? What steps or tasks are more important than others?\n\nIf at all possible, you should put your retirement plans through a test-drive.\n\nGranted, this might sound strange. Most people, seemingly, don\u2019t need to \u201cpractice\u201d retiring. (After all, what\u2019s so difficult about not working?) In truth, though, retirement probably will come as a shock to your wallet and lifestyle, and if you can test your planned budget and daily routines before walking away from the office, the transition should be easier.\n\nStart with your time\u2014what you think a typical week might look like. Fill in your calendar with as many specifics as possible. Perhaps Mondays and Wednesdays are set aside for volunteer work. And Tuesdays for pickleball. And Thursdays for continuing-education classes. Write it all down.\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nNext (and I realize this can be tricky for some) take a sabbatical (or, if you prefer, a \u201cstaycation\u201d). Block out at least two (or, ideally, three) weeks of vacation\u2014but spend the time at home, following the calendar you set up. (And, as one financial planner told us, if your boss can\u2019t spare you for three weeks or so\u2014then ask for a raise.)\n\nThe first goal here is to find out if you\u2019re really meant to retire. Are you bored after just two weeks of a trial run? Or does something on your experimental calendar need to be tweaked? As we have discussed in earlier columns, many people focus solely on their finances when it comes to retirement. But trying to figure out what an average week might involve is equally important.\n\nSpeaking of money, I will assume\u2014if you\u2019re a year or so from retiring\u2014that you already have a budget on paper. (We discussed last month several tools that can help with this.) Try living on your retirement budget for, say, four to six months. If your plan, for instance, calls for a monthly income in later life that amounts to 80% of your current income, then limit your monthly spending to the smaller figure.\n\nIf you find yourself going through your money at a faster rate than you anticipated, you need to revisit your retirement budget. Remember: Many retirees have told us through the years that their expenses don\u2019t go down in retirement. Rather, they are simply replaced by new ones: travel, helping family members, entertainment, etc.\n\nThe larger point here: Retirement has enough unknowns as it is. The more you can experience before you cross the starting line, the better.\n\n***\n\nI just turned 66, my full retirement age. My wife is 63. Neither of us is collecting Social Security. We plan for my wife to apply for benefits in the next month or so\u2014after which I will apply for just a spousal benefit. I plan to wait until I turn 70 to switch to my benefit. If I die before I reach age 70, what would my wife collect, or be able to collect, as my survivor?\n\nThis question involves, first, a \u201crestricted application,\u201d applying for just a spousal benefit at full retirement age (as defined by the Social Security Administration) and then switching to one\u2019s own benefit (based on one\u2019s earnings history) at a later point in time\u2014say, age 70. This option is available only to people born before Jan. 2, 1954.\n\nDay by Day How surveyed retirees say they are spending their time More time with family and friends 61% Pursuing hobbies 44% Traveling 39% Volunteer work 21% Taking care of grandchildren 15% Caregiving for a loved one 9% Pursuing an encore career 4% Continuing work in same field 4% Starting a business 1% None of the above 8%\n\nSecond, this question involves \u201cdelayed retirement credits,\u201d the larger payouts that people receive by waiting to file for Social Security beyond their full retirement age. (Note: Benefits \u201cmax out\u201d at 70; you gain nothing by waiting to file beyond that age.)\n\nTo answer your question, let\u2019s say you die at 68. At that point, your wife would be eligible to collect the benefit you would have received based on your work record at 68, including any delayed retirement credits you would have earned. The fact that you filed (or, rather, plan to file) a restricted application \u201cwould have no impact on any potential survivor\u2019s benefits upon death,\u201d notes Darren Lutz, a public affairs specialist with the Social Security Administration. \u201cA widow\u2019s benefit is calculated on the deceased person\u2019s earnings record, and if he or she earns delayed retirement credits, those credits would be credited to a widow\u2019s benefit.\u201d\n\nOne wrinkle: Your wife becomes eligible for your full benefit at her full retirement age. If she claims a survivor\u2019s benefit before she reaches her full retirement age, she would receive a percentage of your benefit.\n\n***\n\nAnd finally, if you plan to continue working through your mid-60s and beyond to beef up your nest egg, spend some time with two recent, sobering reports. Continuing to work beyond what might be considered a normal retirement age can help your finances, as well as your health. But keep in mind that planning to work isn\u2019t necessarily a guarantee of work.\n\nThat point is made painfully clear in two recent studies: \u201cHow Secure Is Employment at Older Ages?\u201d from the Urban Institute and \u201cA Precarious Existence: How Today\u2019s Retirees Are Financially Faring in Retirement\u201d from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.\n\nThe former found that almost half of full-time workers ages 51 to 54 \u201cexperience an employer-related involuntary job separation after age 50 that substantially reduces earnings for years or leads to long-term unemployment.\u201d The latter found that more than half of retirees (56%) retired sooner than they had planned because of layoffs, ill health and family responsibilities, among other reasons.\n\nThe point: Yes, working longer can be a smart strategy to bridge gaps in retirement savings. But it shouldn\u2019t be the only one.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal.
