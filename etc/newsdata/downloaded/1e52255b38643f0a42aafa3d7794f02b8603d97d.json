Sean Buck, approved last month.\n\nThe documents also detailed allegations of an attempted sexual assault in September 2018 and a sexual assault the following month, both in Annapolis, Md. The alleged assaults took place while the women were sleeping, prosecutors said.\n\nNAVY SEAL TEAM LEADERS FIRED AMID SEX ASSAULT, DRINKING ALLEGATIONS THAT LED TO REMOVAL FROM IRAQ\n\nKeago also was charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly urging a female midshipman to \u201clie to military authorities\u201d about the allegations in September 2018 and in May.\n\nIn addition, the 24-year-old chemistry major also faced charges of burglary for allegedly breaking into the dorm rooms or berthing areas.\n\nKeago\u2019s military attorney, Lt. Daniel Phipps, did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.
