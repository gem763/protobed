But Monica will never get over her boy\u2019s terrible fate.\n\nShe said: \u201cLosing Ian has left a hole in my heart that can never be filled.\u201d She vividly recalls the day in October last year when her life was torn apart.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nShe said: \u201cWe heard a helicopter and I \u00adinstinctively knew something was wrong. I tried \u00adcalling Ian but there was no \u00adanswer. I hurried down the \u00adcorridor to Ian\u2019s flat. There is a glass door, which was shut but inside, to my horror, I could see Ian on the floor surrounded by police. It was all \u00adcordoned off.\n\n\u201c\u2018That\u2019s my son\u2019 I said, as I burst into tears. I couldn\u2019t bear what I was seeing and hurried back home.\n\n\u201cThat is something no mother should ever have to see.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nNeighbour Gary Beech, 48, and Michael Swan, 45, stabbed amateur boxer Ian in the neck and beat him over the head with a baseball bat so hard that it split. He was \u00adpronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThere had been \u201ca history of \u00adtension\u201d between dad-of-two Ian and the pair on Doddington Estate, Battersea, South London.\n\nBeech, who had known Ian since childhood, dealt class A drugs from his flat \u00adopposite the victim\u2019s. Swan, described as a serious crack and heroin addict, was also involved in drug dealing and a regular visitor to the block.\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\nThey were thought to have dealt from CCTV blind spots on the \u00adestate. Their brutal attack was recorded on CCTV yet both claimed self-defence.\n\nSwan was jailed for a minimum of 21 years and Beech has to serve at least 19 years.\n\nOld Bailey judge Rebecca Poulet QC described it as \u201csustained and gratuitous violence\u201d and said Ian died \u201ctrying to combat serious \u00adantisocial behaviour in his block.\u201d\n\nIan stood up to the pushers after he saw kids spiralling into \u00adaddiction.\n\n(Image: Paul Davey/SWNS SWNS.com)\n\nHis murder comes amid growing claims the Government has lost control of our streets as \u00adsurging demand for drugs fuels a rapid rise in knife crime.\n\nOffice for National Statistics figures show murder and \u00admanslaughter cases, excluding terror attacks, increased from 655 in 2017 to 732 last year.\n\nIan\u2019s niece, Keisha Tomlin, 30, said: \u201cThe \u00adestate I grew up on will never feel like home again. Ian stood up for local people who are scared. They said his was a hero\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cA councillor said he hoped Ian\u2019s passing will leave a legacy of change there.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\n\u201cAll my uncle \u00adwanted was to live in a nice community, free from drugs and \u00adviolence, where our children would be safe.\u201d\n\nIan was one of Monica\u2019s seven children. She said: \u201cOur family was \u00adbroken. Months passed in a blur. Ian was the most amazing son. He spent his life looking out for others.\n\n\u201cEvery time I go into the church now all I see is Ian\u2019s coffin and all I can remember are Ian\u2019s bright eyes looking at me.\n\n\u201cIt breaks my heart. I can never be happy about anything now. I feel guilty if I laugh about anything.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Have-a-go-hero Ian Tomlin was stabbed in the neck and beaten with a baseball bat in Battersea, South London", "authors": ["Dan Warburton", "Mark Christy", "Image", "Pa", "Swns.Com", "Paul Davey Swns Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653888.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Keisha-and-Monica-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
