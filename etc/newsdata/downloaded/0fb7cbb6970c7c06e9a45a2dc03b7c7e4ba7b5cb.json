Changing just one member of the seven-seat cabinet would be a political sensation.\n\nA Sotomo poll this month for broadcaster SRF showed the right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party (SVP), which won record seats in 2015 amid Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, will dip 2.1 points to 27.3% while the Green Party\u2019s share will rise more than 3 points to 10.7% of the vote.\n\nThe smaller, more centrist Green Liberal Party (GLP) is also expected to advance, bringing their combined strength to a theoretical 18%.\n\nThat would place them collectively third behind the SVP and the center-left Socialists (SP), ahead of the center-right Liberals (FDP), who all have two of the seats on the Federal Council that is Switzerland\u2019s government.\n\nCabinet seats have been divvied up among the SVP, SP, FDP and Christian People\u2019s Party (CVP) in nearly the same way since 1959.\n\nIn December, the two parliamentary chambers will elect the government, but in the past it has taken more than one national election cycle for that selection procedure to change the cabinet lineup to more closely reflect the results.\n\nThe Greens\u2019 success could hit all major parties, including the SVP, whose President Albert Roesti has called climate change a \u201ceco-socialist scam against the middle class\u201d.\n\nAnalysts caution against expecting too radical a shift after a campaign that was light on typical hot button issues such as migration and Swiss ties with the European Union.\n\nGreen parties do not have a monopoly on ecological issues and many voters in the rural SVP heartland are loyal.\n\nGLP founder Martin Baeumle told the Schweiz am Wochenende paper it was an \u201cillusion\u201d to think the Greens and GLP could mount a joint effort to seize a cabinet set. He noted differences in the two parties\u2019 economic and social policy, scant representation in the upper house of parliament, and the difficulty of ejecting a sitting member of government.\n\nPolls close at midday (1000 GMT), with initial projections, including from the many postal votes, due soon thereafter.", "description": "Swiss voters' concerns about climate change look set to give the environmentalist Greens strong gains in a parliamentary election on Sunday that could dilute the center-right's grip on power.", "authors": ["Michael Shields", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
