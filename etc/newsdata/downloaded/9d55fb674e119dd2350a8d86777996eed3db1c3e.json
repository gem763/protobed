She says we have a nice house and encourages the nanny to respond. She does not. The voice even jokes that she hopes we don't change our password. I am sick to my stomach,' Newcombe writes.\n\nHe said the frightened nanny refused to answer, which angered the female hacker. 'The voice starts to get agitated at the nanny's lack of response and then snaps, in a very threatening voice: ''I'm coming for the baby if you don't answer me, bi**h!''' he wrote.\n\nJack Newcombe wrote of the terrifying experience in the The Mercury News. He said he and his wife were at work and their nanny was at home with their 18-month-old son when a female voice came over the Nest camera\n\n'She says we have a nice house and encourages the nanny to respond. The voice even jokes that she hopes we don't change our password,' he wrote\n\nNewcombe said he initially grew worried when the nanny texted him and his wife asking if they were speaking through the camera.\n\nHOW TO KEEP YOUR NEST CAMERA FROM GETTING HACKED Nest told users that the company notifies users if they detect their email was part of another website breach. When this happens, the firm will proactively disable their Nest account as a security measure. Other steps users can take: Enable two-factor authentication - They'll be sent a protected code every time they sign in.\n\nChoose stronger passwords - A more secure password includes eight characters or more, as well as a combination of upper and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers.\n\nSet up a Family Account - Instead of sharing your password, share access to your home devices with a user.\n\nBe aware of phishing emails that can make your account vulnerable.\n\nProtect your home network - Make sure your router is up to date and only share login info with select users.\n\nHe immediately pulled up the video feed and could hear the woman's voice speaking to his son through the kitchen camera and 'using bad words'.\n\n'It feels as though my heart is about to beat through my chest. The blood rushes to my face. I am completely helpless,' he said of the experince.\n\nOnce the woman's verbal 'joy riding', as Newcombe describes it, turned dark, he unplugged the cameras and changed all the passwords.\n\nHe told his nanny to take their son to a park down the street n an effort to escape.\n\nNewcombe pointed out that upon doing some research online, he learned he is among a sea of similar cases.\n\nEarlier this year, another family in Los Angeles told of their panic when hackers took over their Nest home security camera to give them a fake warning that three North Korean missiles were about to hit America.\n\nIn December 2018 a Phoenix man thought he was getting robbed when he first heard an unfamiliar voice inside his home.\n\nGoogle, which owns Nest, was forced to send an email to owners of its security devices earlier this year telling them to reset their passwords and enable stronger account authentication settings in light of an uptick in hacked cameras.\n\nThis came after users began reporting a number of bizarre cases, where hackers appeared to take over their Nest security cameras to hurl insults at them, spy on their sleeping baby and even tell Amazon's Alexa to play the song Despacito.\n\nNewcombe described his frustration with Google after calling Nest support which appeared unhelpful.\n\n'I was on hold for an hour and eight minutes. I followed all directions and have subsequently received form emails in broken English,' he wrote.\n\n'Nobody from Google has acknowledged the incident or responded with any semblance of empathy. In every email, they remind me of two-step authentication. They act as if I am going to continue to use Nest cameras.
