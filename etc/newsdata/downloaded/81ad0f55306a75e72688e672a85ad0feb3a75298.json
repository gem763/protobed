USA TODAY\n\nThe occasional splurge won\u2019t sink you financially, but small missteps can quickly develop into bad money habits that could wreck your finances.\n\nWith holiday shopping and expenses looming, now is a good time to develop better money habits. Americans are gearing up to spend a record amount of money this holiday season \u2014 The National Retail Federation predicted sales will rise between 3.8% to 4.2% above 2018 to a total of between $727.9 billion and $730.7 billion.\n\nHere are five common money mistakes you might be making and some strategies to help rein in the flawed financial habits that are hurting your wallet.\n\nUndisciplined saving\n\nNot saving enough is the top financial stressor for millennials, a 2018 Bank of America study found. Josh Strange, the founder of Good Life Financial Advisors of Northern Virginia, said one of the most common money mistakes he encounters is that people aren\u2019t saving money properly.\n\nPeople often don't meet their savings goals because they don\u2019t set aside money immediately after payday, Strange said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t pay yourself first you just don\u2019t get in the habit of doing it,\" Strange said. \"It becomes \u2018Well, I'll save it if I have it.\"\n\nSet up an automatic transfer so that part of your paycheck moves from your checking account to a high interest savings account each month, said Galia Gichon, the founder of Down-to-Earth Finance, a consulting group.\n\nGichon also recommends setting up different savings accounts for different savings goals to avoid dipping into your emergency savings just to cover a big vacation. Even if you\u2019re only saving $50 each month, Gichon said establishing good habits is the first step.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always about the money, it's about our habits,\u201d Gichon said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the people that save automatically save more, without a doubt.\"\n\nWasteful spending\n\nStrange said he often encounters clients who are living beyond their means and amassing consumer debt. The average American adult spends $1,497 a month on nonessential items which can add up to nearly $18,000 a year, according to research commissioned by life insurance company Ladder and conducted by OnePoll.\n\nWasteful spending can become an even bigger issue around the holiday season, Strange said.\n\n\"The holidays can be extremely stressful because people overspend to give people things that they may not want or need because they feel this obligation to give a gift,\" he said.\n\nOne of the first moves Strange makesto tackle a client's wasteful spending is identifying variable expenses that they can cut down or eliminated completely.\n\n\"It might mean not going out to eat as much, canceling a personal service,\" Strange said.. \"We look at whether or not those are things we can afford, and if they are, is it wise to put those on credit cards?\"\n\nGichon suggested making a change like canceling your gym membership or not going out to eat for one month to see tangible results immediately.\n\n\"You see a change right away which makes you feel good about what you're doing,\" she said. \"It might not be a long-term solution, but it makes you feel like you\u2019re headed in the right direction.\"\n\nNot paying off debt\n\nAmericans owe more than $4 trillion in consumer debt, according to the Federal Reserve. If you've racked up a lot of credit card debt, Strange and Deborah Badillo, a financial planner at The Lubitz Financial Group in Miami, both recommended shopping around for interest rates and transferring the balance to a lower interest card, ideally 0% APR.\n\n\"Consumers forget to shop around for the best rates to make sure their money is working for them,\" Badillo said.\n\nStrange suggested paying off the cards with the highest balance and highest interest rates first and working your way down\n\nIf his clients can only afford to pay the minimum payment on their credit cards, Strange recommends getting rid of them altogether.\n\nNot planning for retirement early enough\n\nBoth Strange and Badillo said younger clients often don't start saving for retirement early enough. About 25% of non-retired adults say they have nothing saved, according to the Fed.\n\nBadillo emphasized how important it is to take advantage of employee benefits like 401(k) match programs if they are available to you. Retirement accounts allow you to save a portion of your paycheck before taxes, and many employers will match part of your contribution.\n\n\"Make sure that you take advantage of those programs especially if there\u2019s a match, because [if you don't] then you\u2019re just leaving free money on the table,\" Badillo said.\n\nBadillo also said it's important that younger clients start an IRA or Individual Retirement Account because starting earlier gives your savings more time to grow thanks to compound interest.\n\nIgnoring money problems\n\nMoney is often cited as the number one source of stress for Americans, and Strange, Gichon and Badillo all cautioned that ignoring money problems only makes them worse. Gichon noted that clients often spend more consciously when they pay with cash, but using credit cards can make it easier to lose track or ignore how much you're spending.\n\n\"I think when money worries start to escalate we bury our heads in the sand,\" Gichon said.\n\nShe suggested people stick to using one or two credit cards, and to check their balances every day. Strange said he often sees clients fail to pay huge credit card bills because they don't want to empty out their savings.\n\n\"It\u2019s like this mental roadblock,\" he said.\n\nThe key to getting over financial anxiety is finding what motivates you to accomplish your goals, whether that be paying off debt or saving a certain amount, Badillo said, emphasizing that it's important to take baby steps.\n\n\"We tend to trip if we do something too big, too drastic,\" she said.\"You\u2019re going to have setbacks and it takes a while to develop a healthy habit of being financially sound and checking your money.\"\n\nFollow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2019/10/24/savings-5-bad-money-habits-avoid-and-how-break-them/3903341002/", "description": "Here are five common money mistakes you might be making and some strategies to help curb the financial habits that are hurting your wallet.", "authors": ["N'Dea Yancey-Bragg", "Published A.M.
