The Washington Capitals\u2019 historic Stanley Cup win was 16 months ago, but the list of victories for Monumental Sports and Entertainment grew this October.\n\nTed Leonsis kicked off the month by formally announcing plans for a sportsbook at Capital One Arena, which is on track to be the first facility of its kind inside a U.S. professional sports venue. Then the Washington Mystics won their first WNBA title \u2014 in their new home on the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus that opened last fall \u2014 and Bradley Beal signed an extension with the Washington Wizards.\n\nTaken together, it\u2019s been the most high-profile stretch for Monumental since Leonsis founded the company via merger in 2010. But the owner himself sees the championships as a marker for something greater he wants to build within the District.\n\n\u201cIt was just wonderful to see this plan come together and it reinforces to our organization that if we do the right things in the right way, we can bring the community closer together,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cWe did it around Capital One Arena with the Caps. Now we did it in Greater Washington in the new St. E\u2019s facility.\u201d\n\nMost team owners can\u2019t lay claim to two championships in two years, especially in two different sports. What\u2019s left might be Monumental\u2019s biggest challenge of all.\n\nThe Wizards\u2018 only NBA title came in 1978 when they were the Washington Bullets, and the franchise hasn\u2019t won 50 games in a season since. National media have taken to using them as a punchline. But Leonsis believes it\u2019s their turn to follow what their sister and brother teams accomplished.\n\n\u201cWhat the players and the organization need to internalize is that it is doable,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cWe can believe in the formula because we\u2019ve seen it work and we\u2019ve seen how we turned around, if you will, both the Mystics and the Capitals \u2026 Now we have to focus on how we can do the same kind of development to win a championship at the Washington Wizards.\u201d\n\nBeal signed a two-year, $72 million extension with the Wizards Thursday, taking a major trade target off the market for now. Last season, Leonsis made clear that he abhors the idea of tanking to set up a rebuild, and shipping Beal out of town for a haul of draft picks would have rendered the 2019-2020 team rudderless.\n\nNow, the Wizards will attempt once more to build a roster around John Wall, once he returns from his Achilles injury, and Beal.\n\nLeonsis had breakfast with Beal\u2019s agent Mark Bartelstein early last week, not long after general manager Tommy Sheppard also met with Bartelstein. Leonsis seems to have sold Bartelstein and Beal on the vision he has for the Wizards\u2018 rebuild, a grandiose plan launched in July with the synergy-minded restructuring of \u201cMonumental Basketball.\u201d\n\nOn Beal\u2019s part, it\u2019s a major sign of commitment to a team that pundits don\u2019t give much of a chance to make the playoffs this year. Beal expressed confidence in Leonsis\u2018 plan, crediting the owner\u2019s actions over his words.\n\n\u201cAnybody can say anything. Can you show it? Can you prove it?\u201d Beal said. \u201cAnd Ted\u2019s reorganized this entire basketball organization from the top down. That in itself shows his commitment. He\u2019s made changes around here, just small things. Made changes in the staff \u2026 You have to tip your hat off to it because he didn\u2019t sit on his hands.\u201d\n\nLeonsis holds an annual preseason meeting to talk to the entire Wizards organization. At this year\u2019s meeting, he said he brought a box of rings \u2014 including not just the Capitals\u2019 Stanley Cup ring, but championship rings won by their AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears; the Washington Valor of the Arena Football League; and even by one of Leonsis\u2019s esports ventures, Team Liquid, for its \u201cDota 2\u201d championship. (The Mystics\u2019 ring is still being designed.)\n\n\u201cI said to the Wizards, the whole organization, our singular focus is to do what we did for every one of those other teams and leagues and communities, now with the Wizards,\u201d Leonsis said.\n\nA believer in synergy and \u201ccross-learning,\u201d Leonsis hopes Monumental Basketball creates a closer partnership between the Wizards and G League affiliate Capital City Go-Go, in the same vein that the Bears\u2019 success contributed to \u201corganizational belief\u201d in the Capitals.\n\nTo Leonsis, the formula also calls for \u201cwinning with a higher calling in mind.\u201d He delights in celebrating the charitable work done by Mystics stars Natasha Cloud and Elena Delle Donne. Beal, Wall and new Wizard Isaiah Thomas all have won the NBA Cares Community Assist Award honoring their philanthropic activity.\n\n\u201cWe also believe that one connects with the other, that if we have great people who are connected to the community, it\u2019ll translate up to us winning. And if we\u2019re winning, we can leverage that glow, if you will, to shine it on the community on an ongoing basis,\u201d Leonsis said.\n\nAs the Washington Nationals embark on their first World Series, the District is four wins away from becoming the country\u2019s next \u201cTitletown.\u201d Leonsis attended Game 3 of the National League Championship Series, in part to support the Lerner family, which owns the Nationals and a minority stake in Monumental.\n\nWhen Leonsis tried to visit the men\u2019s room during the game, he said Nationals fans kept stopping him for high-fives and pictures. Perhaps one of those Washingtonians also wanted to ask Leonsis to buy the woeful Redskins from Dan Snyder and turn that team around too. But Leonsis said the fans only had positive comments \u2014 and that his focus is on Monumental.\n\n\u201cDan, when we won the Stanley Cup, wrote me a very nice personal note and sent me a big bottle of Champagne,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been very, very gracious and supportive of us, and I look forward to reciprocating when they win a Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nThough he made it to that Nationals game, Leonsis was notably absent from Game 5 of the WNBA Finals when the Mystics defeated the Connecticut Sun to clinch their first title. A spokesperson said Leonsis was in London, where his daughter lives, for a previously scheduled family commitment at the time.\n\nThat missed game aside, Leonsis is no absentee WNBA owner. New league commissioner Cathy Englebert has been impressed with his support and desire to give a greater platform for women\u2019s sports.\n\n\u201cHe and I and others were frustrated around, why don\u2019t we have a better revenue model?\u201d Englebert said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have more sponsorships? Why don\u2019t our players have more endorsement opportunities? \u2026 It\u2019s all these things that Ted sees and I see so clearly \u2014 the opportunity and the upside of supporting women\u2019s basketball and the WNBA and women\u2019s sports in society more broadly.\u201d\n\nOnly time will tell if the Wizards can copy what the Mystics achieved. Nobody expects it to happen this year, not with Wall sidelined for several months. But if the Monumental Basketball model someday does lead the Wizards all the way back to the playoffs and into the NBA Finals on a Mystics-esque or even Nationals-esque run, Leonsis will hold it up as one more thing Washingtonians can revel in together.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we try to impart to the players and the organization,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cThe role that we can play in this community is unbelievably meaningful, and it\u2019s not just about basketball. It\u2019s not just about hockey. It\u2019s not just about getting the ring. It\u2019s making these lifelong memories.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
