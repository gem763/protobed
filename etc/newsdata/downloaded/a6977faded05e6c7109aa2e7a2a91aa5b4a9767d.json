Photo: Getty Images\n\nOn Sunday night, Mad Men star Jon Hamm and Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus attended the opening performance of illusionist Derren Brown\u2019s Broadway show, Derren Brown: Secret. According to People, one source said the pair \u201clooked like they were having a great time,\u201d and \u201cit very much felt like they were on a date.\u201d But was their outing definitive proof that they are kissing? Or was it, like Derren\u2019s show, a feat of \u201cpsychological illusionism\u201d?\n\n\u201cThe two sat next to each other and Jon was right next to the aisle. They weren\u2019t hiding anything!\u201d another source told Us Weekly.\n\nThe source went on: \u201cLindsay and Jon didn\u2019t show much PDA, but there was definitely some flirtatious banter. Lindsay turned her head to talk to Jon before the show, during intermission and after the show. She was always smiling and looked like she was enjoying her conversations with Jon.\u201d\n\nHm. This could describe two people in the throes of new love, sure. Or it could also describe two adult, human friends interacting with each other.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. When Hamm went to get refreshments at intermission (a bottle of water for her, a fountain drink for himself), the source says Shookus seemed distracted by her phone \u201cbut she still made sure to give Jon attention.\u201d Again, maybe proof of kissing, maybe just a person being polite.\n\nA source close to Shookus \u2014 who split from her ex, Ben Affleck earlier this year \u2014 told Us Weekly that Shookus and Hamm are \u201cjust friends and they have been for over a decade.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time rumors about Shookus and Hamm dating have floated around. The two reportedly were spotted together at a Kanye West concert at Madison Square Garden in September 2016, \u201clooking cozy.\u201d When \u201cPage Six\u201d reached out to Hamm\u2019s reps about the report a few months later they said that he and Shookus \u201chave not dated. They are not friends; they are acquaintances.\u201d\n\nI guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see if the pair end up getting iced coffee together.\n\nStay in touch.
