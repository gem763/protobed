REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson/File Photo\n\nThe MAX, Boeing\u2019s newest single-aisle aircraft, was grounded worldwide in March after two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia within five months. Boeing is updating flight control software at the centre of both crashes that must be approved by regulators before the planes can fly commercially again.\n\nNormally, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has taken the lead on certifying Boeing aircraft and other aviation regulators globally follow suit, a process supported by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).\n\nBut global regulators have indicated they would pursue their own analysis of the 737 MAX and Boeing\u2019s proposed updates, rather than simply following the FAA, which has suffered a dent to its credibility following the two crashes.\n\n\u201cWith the 737 MAX we are a bit worried ... because we don\u2019t see the normal unanimity among international regulators that should be the case,\u201d Alexandre de Juniac, IATA director general, told reporters ahead of a summit in Chicago.\n\n\u201cWe see a discrepancy that\u2019s detrimental to the industry.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement, the FAA said it has a \u201ctransparent and collaborative relationship\u201d with other civil aviation authorities as it continues its review of changes to software on the Boeing 737 MAX.\n\n\u201cEach government will make its own decision to return the aircraft to service based on a thorough safety assessment,\u201d the agency said.\n\nU.S. airlines are scheduling without the 737 MAX into December or early next year, taking a financial hit while the jets remain grounded.\n\nBoeing is targeting regulatory approval for the fixes and new pilot training in October, though the FAA reiterated on Tuesday it does not have a firm timeline to put the jets back in the air.\n\n\u201cOur first priority is safety, and we have set no timeframe for when the work will be completed,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Montreal-based IATA has hosted two summits about the 737 MAX that have included the participation of international airlines, Boeing, the FAA and other regulators.\n\nIf regulators do wish to change the single certification process, de Juniac urged them to it \u201ccollectively.\u201d", "description": "The head of global airlines lobby IATA warned on Tuesday that a discrepancy among global regulators over reapproving Boeing Co's 737 MAX for commercial flight could set a worrying precedent for future aircraft programs.", "authors": ["Tracy Rucinski", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425851777&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821Q6"}
