A recent switch back to a cheaper winter blend of gasoline will likely help limit increases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is some potential for this to get worse, but for many motorists (seeing posts on social media), there is no reason to run out to fill up,\u201d DeHaan said, predicting prices will not surpass their previous 2019 high.\n\nDrivers in California, however, could be hit the hardest. Nearly half of what Saudi Arabia exports to the U.S. is sent to the West Coast, as reported by Reuters.

That compares with $2.84 at the same time last year.\n\nOn Monday, West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude prices experienced their largest gain since Dec. 2008 \u2013 and the highest settle since May 21.\n\nOver the weekend, drone attacks on the heart of Saudi oil production sparked huge fires that halted Aramco production operations. More than 5 percent of the global oil supply was disrupted.\n\nStorage tanks are seen at the North Jiddah bulk plant, an Aramco oil facility, in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, Sunday, Sept. 15, 2019.

He also said the U.S. would release oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which holds about 640 million barrels of crude.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFOX Business\u2019 Charles Brady contributed to this report.", "description": "California drivers could be hit the hardest.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/gas-station-screenshot.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
