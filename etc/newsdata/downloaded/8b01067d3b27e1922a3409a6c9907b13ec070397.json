He said, \"I just think they are a dynasty. I think they are all amazing people with [...] amazing capabilities.\"\n\nA dynasty can refer to a hereditary line of rulers, but it can also refer to a broader succession of family members who play prominent roles in politics, business, or other fields.\n\nTrump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale addresses the crowd before U.S. President Donald Trump rallies with supporters in Manchester, New Hampshire U.S. August 15, 2019.

In 2016, Trump lost California by over 4 million votes.\n\n\"Many of you are worried that we have written you guys off, that California doesn't matter,\" Parscale told the crowd at the convention, the AP reports. \"There's a lot of work out here to be done.\"", "description": "At a Republican Party convention in California, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said the Trump family will become 'a dynasty' with 'a new party.'", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d75401d2e22af560f634312-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
