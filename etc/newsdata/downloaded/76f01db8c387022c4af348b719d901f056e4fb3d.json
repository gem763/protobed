Did I make a mistake? Well maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not,\u201d he said during an interview on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that aired Tuesday.\n\nIt was Biden\u2019s first interview since his overseas dealings came into the spotlight.\n\nWhile Biden said he did not specifically regret his business ventures, he said he wished he\u2019d foreseen it as a political liability.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, Biden\u2019s business interests have become a frequent point of attack for President Trump, who\u2019s lambasted the 49-year-old\u2019s ties to both Ukraine and China.\n\nBiden\u2019s foreign connections also prompted Trump to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July phone call to investigate the 2020 hopeful, as well as his son -- consequently leading to an impeachment inquiry into the chief executive from House Democrats, who\u2019ve accused him of intentionally withholding almost $400 million in aid.\n\n\u201cWhat I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this -- this ridiculous conspiracy idea,\u201d he said.\n\nGiuliani and Trump have claimed that Biden leveraged his name to earn $1.5 billion from Chinese investors, who were seeking to curry favor with the vice president.\n\n\u201cWhen Biden\u2019s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund \u2014 and the biggest funds in the world can\u2019t get money out of China \u2014 and he\u2019s there for one quick meeting, and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that\u2019s a horrible thing. I think it\u2019s a horrible thing,\u201d Trump said during a joint press conference with Zelenskiy on Sept. 25.\n\nBut Biden disputed that claim, saying it had \"no basis in fact.\"\n\n\"They feel like they have the license to go out and say whatever they want,\" he said. \"It feels to me like living in some kind of, you know, \"Alice in Wonderland,\" where you're up on the real world and then you fall down the rabbit hole, and, you know, the president's the Cheshire Cat asking you questions about crazy things that don't bear any resemblance to the reality of anything that has to do with me.\"\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Biden had served as a board member at the BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Company since late 2013. He purchased about 10 percent of the company for roughly $420,000 in 2017 (when his father was no longer vice president).\n\nThe $1.5 billion that Trump is referencing is seemingly about a sum BHR was trying to raise in 2014 to invest outside of China, according to a Wall Street Journal report at the time. Biden also claimed that he made no many during his dealings with the firm.\n\nBiden will step down from the board later this month, his lawyer said in a statement on Sunday. If Joe Biden nabs the Democratic nomination and defeats Trump in the 2020 election, Hunter vowed to \"not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies,\" his attorney said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "While Biden said he did not specifically regret his business ventures, he said he wished he\u2019d foreseen it as a political liability.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Hunter-Biden-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
