(Russian Foreign Ministry via Associated Press)\n\nIt was all smiles Wednesday when President Trump welcomed Russia\u2019s foreign minister and ambassador to the United States to the White House.\n\nOf course, we only know that thanks to photos from Russia's state news agency. Its photographer was the only one allowed in the meeting, while U.S. journalists were kept out.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Although the encounter between Trump, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak took place in the center of American power, it was Tass, the official Russian news agency, that had the pictures.\n\nAccording to Andrei Sitov, the Tass bureau chief in Washington, the Russian photographer who took the photos covers Lavrov full time and came with him on the plane. He was presented to the White House as the official photographer.\n\nIt was a curious choice for a meeting that took place less than a day after Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey, who was leading the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russian officials.\n\nQuestions about whether Trump fired Comey because of that investigation have swirled since the firing was announced on Tuesday evening.\n\nLavrov arrived in Washington on Tuesday and met with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday morning. As he was entering the State Department, a reporter asked whether the dismissal of Comey \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over Wednesday's meetings. Lavrov joked the question away. \u201cWas he fired?\u201d he sarcastically asked. \u201cYou are kidding. You are kidding.\u201d\n\nAfter the news conference, Trump met face-to-face with Lavrov. The Russian Foreign Ministry was quick to capitalize on the moment, tweeting one of the first photos of the two men shaking hands.\n\nAlso in attendance was Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States. Kislyak's presence was surprising \u2014 he's a key figure in the investigation of the Trump administration's ties to Russia.\n\nTrump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was fired after it came out that he'd met with Kislyak on several occasions but hadn't disclosed the meetings. Attorney General Jeff Sessions also recused himself from anything related to the Russia investigation after it emerged that he, as a U.S. senator, had met twice with Kislyak in July and September, interactions he did not disclose when questioned at his Senate confirmation hearing this year for the attorney general position.\n\nTrump described Wednesday's meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak as \u201cvery, very good,\u201d observing that both the United States and Russia want to stop \u201cthe horrible, horrible killing in Syria as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAs the meeting concluded, the wire service Getty released photos credited to Tass showing all three men standing together in a chummy moment.\n\nMatt Novak from Gizmodo tweeted the photos ....\n\nPhotos of Trump's meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak just hit the Getty wire and they're all credited to Russian news agency TASS pic.twitter.com/qE9lWB6KuS \u2014 Matt Novak (@paleofuture) May 10, 2017\n\n... and Twitter was quick to respond, noting the strange encounter and offering its own sarcastic quips.\n\n\"Hey there, Serge, old buddy! How's it.. uh, I mean, uh, very nice to meet you for the first time ever, Ambassador Kislyak. So nice.\" pic.twitter.com/jCEa1HkPus \u2014 Mig Greengard (@chessninja) May 10, 2017\n\n\"And then I said I fired him because he wasn't doing a good job!\" pic.twitter.com/02IUIJQZ8C \u2014 Eliot Higgins (@EliotHiggins) May 10, 2017\n\nOthers at today's Trump Lavrov meeting included.... pic.twitter.com/NwCoS8Bpwq \u2014 Tim Hillard (@timehillard) May 10, 2017\n\nIn addition to the Russian officials, Trump also welcomed Henry Kissinger to the White House on Wednesday morning. The meeting was not on the president's official schedule, and it took the press pool by surprise. They were ushered into the Oval Office expecting to see Lavrov, but instead found Trump chatting with the 93-year-old former American diplomat.\n\nKissinger, of course, is most famous for serving as national security adviser and secretary of state under President Richard Nixon. More recently, he has advised Trump on key appointments and praised his leadership. Kissinger \u201chas maintained close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin,\u201d according to Politico, and said previously that Comey was \u201cnot doing a good job.\u201d\n\n\n\nFormer secretary of state Henry Kissinger and President Trump speak to reporters in the Oval Office. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nKissinger is both celebrated as a realist statesman and reviled as an amoral meddler in the affairs of foreign countries. He helped orchestrate a more open relationship between the United States and China and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973, but also helped overthrow Chilean President Salvador Allende and pushed the United States to secretly bomb Cambodia.\n\nOf the meeting, Trump said that he and Kissinger talked about Russia \u201cand various other matters,\u201d including Syria.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with a president inviting foreign representatives to the Oval Office, but sitting presidents do not usually host foreigners linked to major scandals in their own administration.\n\nThey also tend to avoid photo-ops with representatives of countries accused of interfering in U.S. elections.\n\nThey might also avoid someone so closely associated with Nixon on a day when their decision to fire the sitting FBI head is being compared to some of that disgraced president's worst offenses.\n\nBut, as we've learned again and again in these last 111 days, Trump is no ordinary president.\n\nCarol Morello contributed to this report.\n\nNote: A previous version of this story said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov joked with reporters about the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey as he was entering the Oval Office.
