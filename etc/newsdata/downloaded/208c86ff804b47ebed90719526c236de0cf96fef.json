Sweeney also says that this situation shouldn\u2019t occur again in the future, as Epic plans to communicate refund and Steam key policies upfront to avoid these late-stage predicaments.\n\nWhen future games go Epic-exclusive after offering crowdfunding rewards on other PC stores, we\u2019ll either coordinate with colleagues at the other stores to ensure key availability in advance, or guarantee refunds at announcement time. \u2014 Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) July 2, 2019\n\nA long-awaited third game in Yu Suzuki\u2019s venerated classic Dreamcast series, Shenmue III launched its Kickstarter campaign four years ago, promising PC availability on Steam and earning more than $6 million to deliver the game by December 2017. That delivery window was ultimately pushed to November 2019 after a series of delays, and last month at E3, Suzuki\u2019s company Ys Net announced that its publishing partner Deep Silver had struck a deal with Epic to bring the PC version of the game exclusively to Epic\u2019s PC storefront.\n\nThat frustrated some backers expecting a Steam release, as well as members of the broader PC gaming community that continue to push back against Epic\u2019s strategy of securing exclusivity to help bolster the popularity of its game store, which has a more generous 88 / 12 percent revenue cut over Steam\u2019s industry 70 / 30.\n\nOn the surface, the controversy sounds trivial; PC gamers are generally upset they have to use a different app to launch games on Epic\u2019s platform, unlike the exclusivity arrangement on consoles that stipulates consumers own an entirely different piece of hardware. But the PC gaming community has also expressed general distaste with exclusivity as a concept, rather than the actual inconveniences it generates. A number of pro-Steam contingents of the community also consider Epic\u2019s store an inferior product to Steam, with the Epic Game Store still missing some key features that have existed for years on Steam.\n\nThat said, it doesn\u2019t look like Epic\u2019s strategy of securing exclusivity on popular titles is winding down any time soon. Following comments made by Epic Games Store chief Steve Allison during the Game Developers Conference in March that suggested Epic might wind down the approach, Sweeney later clarified that the company took time to think it over and decided it would continue securing deals so long as publishers and developers appreciated the terms.\n\nDeep Silver, which also had a rocky launch controversy earlier this year when it had to honor Steam preorders after Epic secured exclusivity on 4A Games\u2019 Metro Exodus, is clearly interested in such deals. So is publisher 2K Games, which kicked off perhaps the most heated chapter in this controversy by signing over launch exclusivity of Gearbox Software\u2019s much-anticipated Borderlands 3 to Epic. (Like every other Epic-exclusive title, Borderlands 3 will also come to Steam at a later date.) Numerous other developers this year have released or plan to release Epic-exclusive games on PC.\n\nThanks to the success of Fortnite and Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine 4, the company has a significant amount of resources to spend on competing with Steam and, in Sweeney\u2019s eyes, shifting the platform arrangement toward a more developer-friendly revenue split. Sweeney has been outspoken about the strategy in press interviews and on Twitter. Just last week, he wrote in response to a Twitter user, \u201cWe believe exclusives are the only strategy that will change the 70/30 status quo at a large enough scale to permanently affect the whole game industry.\u201d And he claims it\u2019s working, as evidenced by the studios and publishers willing to work with Epic and the resulting sales and revenue metrics from Epic\u2019s store.\n\nIf the Epic strategy either succeeds in building a second major storefront for PC games with an 88/12 revenue split, or even just leads other stores to significantly improve their terms, the result will be a major wave of reinvestment in game development and a lowering of costs. \u2014 Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) June 26, 2019\n\nIn the case of Shenmue III, it\u2019s clear the empty promise of a Steam launch version and the resulting refunds Epic will have to fork over are just another bump in the road.\n\n\u201cI believe this approach passes the test of ultimately benefitting gamers after game storefronts have rebalanced and developers have reinvested more of their fruits of their labor into creation rather than taxation,\u201d Sweeney wrote in conclusion of his defense of exclusivity last week. \u201cOf course, there are lots of challenges along the way, and Epic is fully committed to solving all problems that arise for gamers [and] for our partners as the Epic Games store grows.\u201d", "description": "Game studio Ys Net, its publishing partner Deep Silver, and distributor Epic Games have come to a solution to appease angry fans over the PC exclusivity of upcoming, Kickstarter-backed game Shenmue 3.
