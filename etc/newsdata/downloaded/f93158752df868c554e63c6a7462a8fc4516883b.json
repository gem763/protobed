Jonas is set to join the singing competition in spring 2020. USA TODAY\n\nSpoiler alert: This story contains details about Tuesday's episode of \"The Voice.\"\n\nHas John Legend lost his magic touch?\n\n\"I lost my mojo, man,\" the reigning champ and V-EGOT winner said during Tuesday's Blind Auditions after losing gospel singer Ricky Braddy to fellow coach Blake Shelton.\n\nIn typical Shelton fashion, the country artist pointed and laughed in Legend's face to rub it in. \"I love how graceful you are when you win. You're just a class act,\" Legend said sarcastically.\n\nBut the \"All of Me\" singer brought his A-game the rest of the night and did everything in his power to land \"someone who makes me feel good.\"\n\nLast night on 'The Voice':Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani are fighting again\n\n\"The Voice\" coaches Kelly Clarkson, Gwen Stefani, John Legend and Blake Shelton.

But I was like, 'No turn, you like her. You have a chance,'\" Stefani said during her pitch, before trying to win Rayne over with her rock-star attire. \"So I\u2019m going to stand up so you can look at my outfit while I talk.\"\n\nLegend got up and did his own model walk to win back Rayne\u2019s attention and favor, prompting Stefani to up the ante and literally shake a tail feather.\n\n\"That was a really compelling pitch by Gwen,\" Legend said. \"Her outfit is outstanding as well. I thought I would be the most colorful when I picked this jacket, but boy was I wrong.\"\n\nThe modeling pointers from his wife, Chrissy Teigen, appeared to pay off because Rayne joined Team Legend.\n\nMore:Nick Jonas set to replace Gwen Stefani as a coach on 'The Voice' for spring 2020 season\n\nI might not be as colorful as @GwenStefani.. but... I have to say... my team is looking pretty bold to me! #VoiceBlind \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) October 9, 2019\n\nKhalea Lynee, 36, caught everyone's attention with her soulful performance of Daniel Caesar and H.E.R.'s \"Best Part.\" All four judges turned around, a feat that is getting increasingly harder as the season progresses and coaches' teams are filling up.\n\n\"You just mesmerized all four of us and the entire audience,\" Legend said. \"You have so much passion, but you have discipline. I would love for you to be on the team of the defending 'Voice' champion. That\u2019s me!\" Shelton sighed, \"Oh my God.\"\n\nClarkson chimed in, \"I have won twice, so I can win.\"\n\nStefani tried to form a personal connection with Lynee, whose favorite artist is Anita Baker. \"Anita Barker is the first record \u2013 I know it seems weird \u2013 but one of the first records I ever got,\" she exclaimed.\n\nShelton pointed out his seniority. \"I\u2019m the senior choice here. I\u2019m the only person who\u2019s done this show every season since it\u2019s been on TV. \u2026 I think this is meant to be. I love you.\"\n\nWhen Legend felt Lynee slipping away, he pulled out his last trick: His voice. He serenaded her, singing, \"I think America\u2019s going to love you. Body and soul. And I\u2019m going to give you the best that I got.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Clarkson said while throwing up her hands, knowing that her chances of landing the soulful singer plummeted with each word Legend sang.\n\nWhen in doubt.. sing your pitch! I\u2019ll give you a shoutout on #3, Blake. Let\u2019s do this, Khalea! #TeamLegend#VoiceBlinds \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) October 9, 2019\n\nHis tactic paid off. Lynee joined Team Legend. And it's safe to say, his mojo is officially back.\n\nHe added, \"I couldn\u2019t fight fair.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/09/the-voice-recap-john-legend-thinks-he-lost-his-mojo/3914072002/", "description": "The Blind Auditions are winding down on \"The Voice,\" and coaches are upping the ante as they battle for team members.", "authors": ["Cydney Henderson", "Published P.M.
