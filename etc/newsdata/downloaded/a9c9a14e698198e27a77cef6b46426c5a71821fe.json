It also confirmed that from 2023, customers will be able to get a flight on-demand in Dallas and Los Angeles.\n\nUber had in February told an Australian House Infrastructure, Transport and Cities Committee that it was keen to trial Uber Air in either Melbourne or Sydney and that it just needed Australian governments to work alongside the Silicon Valley darling to make that happen.\n\nIn announcing Uber Air was coming to Australia, the company announced partnerships with Macquarie, Telstra, and Westfield-operator Scentre Group, and said it would work with existing partners including Melbourne Airport to develop the infrastructure and telecommunications needed to create the aviation network.\n\nSee also: Uber, US Army partner up for silent electric aircraft tech (CNET)\n\nMalligan was previously Uber's head of cities for Australia and New Zealand.\n\nShe previously worked as a manager in Bain and Company's Private Equity practice in San Francisco and Sydney and holds a combined Bachelor of Commerce and Law degree from the University of Sydney, and a Master of Business Administration from Columbia University in New York.\n\nMeanwhile, Airbus is working on its own air taxi product, Vahana, with the company in July showing off a full-scale demonstrator vehicle that recently completed a full transition flight.\n\nVahana has undertaken more than 80 flight tests since last year, which the company said help to validate the overall design and configuration. The lessons learned from Vahana, Airbus said, will enable Airbus Urban Mobility to develop a future market-ready electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle.\n\nAirbus also has a partnership with Audi.\n\nIn the eVOTL space, there's also competition coming from NFT with its Aska dual-purpose vehicle designed both to drive on roads and to fly through the air; Kitty Hawk, funded by Google co-founder Larry Page and led by self-driving car pioneer Sebastian Thrun; Ehang from China; Terrafugia, which hopes to sell its flying car in 2019; and AeroMobil in Slovakia, which like NFT, hopes for a hybrid flying-driving vehicle.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "The company seems to be pushing forward with the launch of Uber Air in Melbourne next year.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/11/2fd4bd74-c664-45f7-9ca6-b8214d6bb840/thumbnail/770x578/67cba74cc8f4a4d0f34788ed4376a820/uber-air-melbourne.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
