No, because the women\u2019s game is not there yet.\n\n\u201cThe women\u2019s game is not in a place where we should be paying those sorts of figures for players until we start getting more people in the ground.\n\n\u201cWe want to do it the right way and we want people to be here for the right reasons.\n\n\u201cIf I throw money at it I get a player who comes over for two years, takes the money and then disappears.\n\n\u201cYes, there are times when you want to sprinkle a bit of stardust on the team but that has to be invested.\n\n\u201cIt is more about a long-term project here: people who are invested in the club and where we want to go.\u201d\n\nWhere they want to go is top of the FA WSL and into Europe but Stoney is well aware of the challenge they face as they take the next step, having dropped just five points and conceded only seven goals in winning the FA Women\u2019s Championship.\n\nBecause of their name United are a huge draw, with an average attendance of over 2,000 last season, and they will be immediately expected to compete for honours in the top flight.\n\n\u201cI think we have the opportunity to change the face of women\u2019s football because of the global reach the club has and the fan base, which is bigger than I anticipated,\u201d added Stoney.\n\n\u201cIf we can get it right we set the standards that way. Because of the scale of the club we have a huge responsibility to help that and try to promote it.\n\n\u201cIt is my job to balance that with the players because it is really unfair to put that expectation and pressure on a group of young players.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget we started 14 months ago with four weeks to build an entire squad and staff.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just been promoted and all of a sudden there is an expectation to do things we might not be ready to do yet.\n\n\u201cThey (the players) will have to understand it is not going to be like last year. Last year was probably too easy at times, I don\u2019t mean that disrespectfully but we were a full-time team. We weren\u2019t very well liked.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Manchester United Women head coach Casey Stoney will not throw money at her squad in an attempt to make them an instant hit in the women\u2019s game even though there is now huge expectation on them.
