It's unclear whether they have now dropped out of the school or whether an investigation resulted in USC forcing them out.\n\n\"USC is conducting a case-by-case review for current students and graduates that may be connected to the scheme alleged by the government and will make informed decisions as those reviews are completed,'' a USC spokesman told NBC News in March.\n\nOlivia is a social media star who lost multiple sponsorships after her parents were charged. She also happened to be celebrating spring break on a yacht owned by USC chairman Rick Caruso when news of the scandal broke because she is friends with Caruso's daughter.\n\nBoth daughters took a months-long hiatus from social media before returning to wish Loughlin a happy 55th birthday in July.\n\nFour more parents pleaded guilty Monday, admitting to being part of a scheme in which wealthy parents paid bribes to have standardized test scores altered and their children fraudulently recruited as athletes.\n\nActress Felicity Huffman pleaded guilty to mail fraud and honest services fraud in May after paying college admissions fixer William Rick Singer $15,000 to have her daughter's SAT score fraudulently boosted.\n\nThe first images were released Sunday showing the former \"Desperate Housewives\" star in a prison uniform while serving her 14-day sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, a low-security prison in Dublin, California.\n\nLegal experts say Loughlin and Giannulli could potentially face years of prison time if convicted. U.S. attorney Andrew Lelling, the lead federal prosecutor in the case, said in a rare interview earlier this month that Loughlin will almost certainly face a longer sentence than Huffman if she is found guilty.\n\n\"If she is convicted, we would probably ask for a higher sentence for her than we did for Felicity Huffman,'' Lelling said. \"I can't tell you what that would be.\"\n\nHe added: \"The longer the case goes, let's say she goes through trial. If it is after trial, we would ask for something substantially higher. If she resolved it before trial, something lower than that.\"", "description": "Lori Loughlin's daughters, Olivia and Isabella Giannulli, are no longer enrolled at USC as their parents stand accused of paying bribes to get them admitted.", "authors": ["Scott Stump"], "top_image": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_43/1496989/lori-loughlin-olivia-isabella-today-main-191022_d34d91d60da3ee3fe121580659e2367c.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
