Cohen faces years in federal prison after he\u2019s sentenced on December 12.\n\nThe campaign-finance violations concern Cohen\u2019s role in arranging hush-money payments for Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also said she had an affair with Trump. Prosecutors said these payments, which served to suppress damaging information about a candidate for federal office, were tantamount illegal campaign contributions to Trump.\n\nIn a news release detailing Cohen\u2019s crimes, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York did not release the names of those who have not been charged with a crime, describing them with terms like Editor-1 and and Woman-2. But it is clear who they are from previously confirmed information about the Daniels and McDougal matters.\n\nAs previously reported, McDougal wasn\u2019t paid directly by Cohen, but rather the Enqurier\u2019s publisher, American Media, Inc. AMI paid the ex-Playboy playmate $150,000 in 2016 for her life rights, then did not publish her story, a practice known as \u201ccatch and kill.\u201d\n\nMcDougal\u2019s attorney was Keith Davidson, who went on to represent Daniels, an adult-film actress.\n\nPreviously unreported are the allegations, made here by prosecutors, that Davidson worked with the National Enquirer to also catch and kill Daniels\u2019 story.\n\nOn October 8, 2016, Davidson informed Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard that Daniels was \u201cwilling to make public statements and confirm on the record her alleged past affair\u201d with Trump, according to prosecutors. Howard and his boss, American Media, Inc. CEO David Pecker, \u201cthen contacted Cohen and put him in touch\u201d with Davidson,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nOver the next few days, Cohen and Davidson arranged a $130,000 agreement to purchase Daniels\u2019 silence about her alleged affair with Trump.\n\nBut there was a catch, according to prosecutors.\n\n\u201cCohen did not immediately execute the agreement, nor did he pay\u201d Daniels. By October 25, Davidson told Pecker that Daniels was \u201cclose to completing a deal with another outlet to make her story public,\u201d the feds said.\n\nHoward then texted Cohen that \u201c[w]e have to coordinate something on the matter [Davidson is] calling you about or it could look awfully bad for everyone.\u201d\n\nAccording to the prosecutors\u2019 account, Pecker and Howard then called Cohen through an encrypted app, the feds write, before Cohen agreed to pay Daniels and called Davidson to finalize the deal.\n\nThe next day, prosecutors said, Cohen drew down $131,000 from a \u201cfraudulently obtained\u201d home equity loan and deposited it in a bank account he had opened in the name of a Delaware shell corporation, Essential Consultants LLC. The money was then wired to Davidson. After it was deposited, Davidson sent Cohen copies of the settlement agreement that silenced Daniels.\n\nIt was hush money, the feds said, and it was meant to help candidate Trump.\n\n\u201cCohen caused and made the payments described herein in order to influence the 2016 presidential election,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIn so doing, he coordinated with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments. As a result of the payments solicited and made by Cohen,\u201d neither McDougal or Daniels \u201cspoke to the press prior to the election.\u201d\n\nProsecutors seized Cohen\u2019s phones, computers, and documents during an April raid by FBI agents. Soon after, Davidson began reportedly began cooperating with federal investigators. Prosecutors subpoenaed AMI for records related to Cohen\u2019s work in paying off McDougal.\n\nAMI and Davidson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u2014 Victoria Bekiempis contributed to this report.", "description": "For the first time, the Trump-friendly tabloid is said to have played a role in paying off another alleged mistress of the candidate-turned-president.", "authors": ["Justin Miller", "National Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1534897271/180821-miller-stormy-daniels-na-hero_ubq6q3", "published_at": "2018-08-21"}
