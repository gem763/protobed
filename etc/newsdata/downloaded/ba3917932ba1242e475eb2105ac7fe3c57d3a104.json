While the photo already has a solemn tone to it, Adam's caption is especially serious.\n\n\"Being in the public eye isn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows, so we are grateful for our support system of friends and family that aren\u2019t afraid to go to battle for us and lift us up when we are under attack,\" he wrote.\n\nImmediately after seeing the post, many of the Busbys' fans commented that they were thinking of the TLC family and sending their positive thoughts. Adam took the time to reply to a few of his fans and commenters, who were asking questions about the caption. When one fan suggested that Adam was referring to online trolls, the Outdaughtered star replied, \"it goes a little deeper than that. On a much higher level.\"\n\nView photos Photo credit: Instagram More\n\nView photos Photo credit: Instagram More\n\nView photos Photo credit: Instagram More\n\nRight now, it's unclear what prompted Adam's post. Unfortunately though, we do know that online parent shaming is something that the Busbys have had to deal with a lot. Earlier this month, Adam had to shut down one Instagram troll who suggested that he and Danielle take too many vacations away from daughters Olivia Marie, Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Parker Kate, Riley Paige, and Blayke Louise.", "description": "\"Being in the public eye isn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows.\"", "authors": ["Kayla Keegan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A0BkeH3msYkZ5_LooB2DKQ--~B/aD01MDA7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/good_housekeeping_561/4f2f60a1b9130c70f51598ff568af9c3", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
