The result is a movie with a lot of strong moments, but which feels too much like \"It: Endgame\" or \"Once Upon a Time ... in Derry,\" aspiring to epic qualities that it doesn't earn or possess.\n\nThe first movie , which focused on a group of barely pubescent children forced to deal with an ancient evil embodied by the killer clown Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), had a real charm in the bonding of those self-proclaimed losers, which brought Stephen King's novel -- previously turned into a mostly admirable miniseries -- to life.\n\nAs in King's book, this chapter reunites those kids 27 years later to finish what they started. It has the benefit of seeing the youths juxtaposed with their adult incarnations -- played by James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain and Bill Hader, among others -- but spends so much time building toward the inevitable climax that it's only a marginal improvement over the weak ending of the TV version.\n\nIndeed, McAvoy's Bill -- a writer whose stammer returns as old fears are revisited -- is teased about his inability to deliver good endings, a joke that strikes a little too close to home. (There's also a King cameo in which he takes the author to task, just in case anybody wasn't clear on the meta nature of the gag.)\n\nRead More", "description": "'It Chapter Two' review: The Stephen King sequel overstays its welcome, although James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain and Bill Hader add star power to the story.", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190827144656-it-chapter-two-super-tease.jpg"}
