It\u2019s a little overwhelming.\n\nThen there are the litany of brands and what they specialise in. Some are organic, others anti-ageing and a handful, anti-pollution.\n\nSo where to begin? We\u2019ve kept things fairly straightforward with our roundup. The below list consists of hero products and cult classics.\n\nThere\u2019s cleansers, toners and moisturisers with the odd speciality product thrown in for when you feel like giving your skin a boost. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll understand almost everything we recommend here.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers , but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nLiz Earle cleanse and polish hot cloth cleanser: \u00a317, Liz Earle\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why this cult product has won copious awards. Liz Earle\u2019s hot cloth cleanser contains exclusively natural ingredients, such as rosemary, chamomile and cocoa butter. Using it with the warm cloth gently exfoliates the skin and leaves it feeling incredibly clean afterwards. It also happens to be suitable for a wide range of skin types, which is rare in the world of skincare. It\u2019s not even that expensive, another rarity. Once you start using it, you\u2019ll be hooked.\n\nBuy now\n\nCharlotte Tilbury's magic cream: \u00a370, Charlotte Tilbury\n\nThis award-winning moisturiser is an ideal product for summer, given that it contains a high SPF of 25. But considered that we\u2019re told to wear SPF even on the cloudiest of days, you should wear it all year round for optimum protection. It\u2019s quite a heavy cream, so might not be best for those with sensitive skin, but when used sparingly (you\u2019ll want to do this anyway considering the price), it really does leave your complexion looking bright and dewy. It also comes in a lovely hexagonal pot with a rose gold lid that you can keep to store your earrings in once it\u2019s run out.\n\nBuy now\n\nPai kukui and jojoba skin brightening exfoliator: \u00a328, Look Fantastic\n\nExfoliators are a tough one. The affordable options in supermarkets and pharmacies might look decent, but they could also scrub your skin to smithereens. It\u2019s important to exfoliate though to eradicate any dead skin and prevent blackheads from developing. This one from organic British brand Pai is perfect for those looking for something natural and gentle that still does the job. Use it once or twice a week for a quick exfoliation job, or leave it on for a few minutes while you soak in the bath and enjoy its citrus scent.\n\nBuy now\n\nBy Terry lip balm: \u00a340, By Terry\n\nLip balms don\u2019t get better than this. By Terry has become one of the most sought after luxury beauty brands on the market thanks to its signature rose scent that fills the nostrils with a gardenia so joyous, you\u2019ll want to eat almost every product. With this lip balm, you might just get lucky. Its rich texture might feel a little thick when you lather onto your lips \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not one to wear underneath lipstick \u2013 but it leaves them feeling baby skin soft and also stains your pout with a pale pink hue.\n\nBuy now\n\n111 Skin rose gold brightening facial treatment mask: \u00a385, Net-a-porter\n\nSheet masks have become increasingly popular as we look for quick-fix skin treatments that won\u2019t leave our hands smothered in muck. This one from cult brand 111 Skin feels deeply opulent, and not just because of its rose gold sheen. It\u2019s a little slimey and slippery to apply, but once you do, you can feel its benefits soaking into your skin. After just 15 minutes, you can remove it and see instant glowing results. Just be sure to rub in any excess moisture as opposed to washing the goodness away immediately after removing the mask.\n\nBuy now\n\nSisley clay mask: \u00a385, Net-a-porter\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to choose one product from Sisley\u2019s infallible skincare range, but its clay mask takes the winning spot thanks to its silky smooth texture that doesn\u2019t feel anywhere near as clogged-up as some other clay masks. It also doesn\u2019t harden the skin when it\u2019s drying, which can happen a lot with cheaper variations. Easy to wash off with just a flannel and warm water, this is the only clay mask you should be investing in.\n\nBuy now\n\nSunday Riley C+E micro dissolve cleansing oil: \u00a335, Space NK\n\nThis gentle cleansing oil is the best makeup remover on the market, stripping away even the most robust of mascaras in just one swipe with a cotton pad. You really don\u2019t need to use a lot to get the full effect, meaning it\u2019s worth the high price tag. Plus, the oil itself contains vitamin C and turmeric, both of which have been proven to offer plenty of benefits to the skin.\n\nBuy now\n\nGlossier balm dotcom: \u00a310, Glossier\n\nThis lip balm is a best seller from the famously Instagrammable American brand founded by Emily Weiss. It\u2019s deeply moisturising but also comes in various tints, so it acts as both a lip shade and a balm. It\u2019s strangely addictive, so be warned that your product \u2013 which comes in a paint style tube \u2013 might run out quite quickly. We liked the purple shade, not only because it tinted our lips with a pleasant shade of berry, but because it happened to leave them tasting fruity and delicious too.\n\nBuy now\n\nBurts Bees orange cleanser: \u00a37.29, Amazon\n\nThis cleanser is worth purchasing for the scent alone. The orange smell is immediately palette cleansing when washed all over your face. It\u2019s also good at removing any blusher or bronzer you might\u2019ve been wearing that day, though you might need something stronger to remove eye makeup. Burts Bees prides itself on quality and natural ingredients, so you know everything you\u2019re rubbing into your complexion is providing a heady dose of key nutrients. This is a particularly good product for oily skin.\n\nKhiels tumeric scrub: \u00a336, Space NK\n\nThis bright orange face mask truly invigorates any complexion and feels delightful and refreshing when applied. It contains extracts of cranberry seed and turmeric, but thankfully doesn\u2019t leave your skin tainted yellow like the spice would. Instead, it simply has a brightening effect that will make you want to use it again and again. Though we suggest using it just once a week.\n\nBuy now\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder advanced night repair: \u00a358, Est\u00e9e Lauder\n\nThis is a favoured product among celebrities and models, and for good reason. Est\u00e9e Lauder has sold heaps of its famous night oil for years, it is the definition of a cult product. Why? Because you only need a single drop applied before you moisturiser to see transformative effects on your skin. If you\u2019re suffering from a breakout, you\u2019ll almost always see an improvement the next day having gone to sleep with this product on your skin. We couldn\u2019t recommend it more highly.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Skincare for women in their 20s and 30s\n\nIt has to be Liz Earle. While there are admirable products included in this list, cleanse and polish is the one that will stand the test of time and keep you coming back for more when you run out. It\u2019s affordable, all-natural and easy-to-use and genuinely leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
