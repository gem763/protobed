Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in recent polls. But the debate\u2014the first during which only the top 10 candidates will appear on a single stage\u2014will follow a period in which several of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign trail miscues were magnified.\n\nIt also comes after a New Hampshire cattle call in which Ms. Warren appeared before cheering throngs of activists, and several of Mr. Biden\u2019s rivals said the party needed to avoid the trap of picking a safer choice against Mr. Trump.\n\nVoters ask questions during a Joe Biden campaign town hall on Sept. 6 in Laconia, N.H.

Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ask other people to vote for someone we don\u2019t believe in,\u201d Ms. Warren said at Saturday\u2019s New Hampshire\u2019s state party convention.\n\nWithout mentioning Mr. Biden by name, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said the party couldn\u2019t \u201cplay it safe\u201d in choosing a nominee while former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro pointed to Democrats\u2019 history of nominating a \u201cnew, exciting face.\u201d\n\nThe 76-year-old Mr. Biden is seeking the presidency for the third time and has dominated Democratic polls as the candidate viewed as the most electable against the president, ahead of Mr. Sanders, 78, and Ms. Warren, 70.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News survey released during the weekend found Mr. Biden with 29% among registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, followed by Mr. Sanders at 19% and Ms. Warren at 18%. The poll found that nearly half of the electorate viewed Mr. Biden as having the best chance of defeating Mr. Trump, an attribute that the former vice president has made a key part of his campaign.\n\nA senior Biden campaign adviser said the former vice president has maintained his position despite being \u201cunder relentless attack\u201d since before he entered the race. In Houston, the former vice president will seek to emphasize his work during his career to accomplish \u201cprogressive change,\u201d and highlight a divide in the field between \u201cthose who want to build on the Obama legacy and those who want to attack it.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden waves to the audience after the July 31 debate in Detroit.

Bush to level with the public about the potential for a long war. But he also said in July 2003, for example, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, \u201cI voted to go into Iraq, and I\u2019d vote to do it again.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders has suggested he may revisit Mr. Biden\u2019s Iraq war vote in the debate. During an appearance last week on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d Mr. Sanders sidestepped a question about Mr. Biden\u2019s recent gaffes but added, \u201cOur records are very different. Joe voted for the war in Iraq, Joe voted for the Wall Street bailout. I did not,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.\n\nIn a \u201cBern Notice\u201d email distributed by the campaign, Mr. Sanders\u2019s adviser David Sirota wrote that Mr. Trump \u201cis a president who treats details as irrelevant\u201d and had displayed \u201cterrible judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a Democratic nominee with good judgment who knows that when the details are ignored, working people get left behind,\u201d Mr. Sirota wrote.\n\nThe leading Democratic candidates look likely to share the same stage at the next presidential debate, after Tom Steyer failed to get the support needed to qualify, according to two polls.

Joe Manchin. \u201cThe problem is that the media and opponents will fixate on it and if you\u2019re Biden, or any candidate, you never want to hand others any opportunity to muddy your message.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s team has pushed back against the coverage of the gaffes, arguing that they have little bearing on voters\u2019 view of him.\n\nThe senior Biden adviser said Mr. Biden always wants to know if he has misstated a fact but the campaign would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d encourage him to change his way of speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s part of who he is and why people like him,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cThey know they\u2019re getting the real Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nBut in the aftermath of the flubs, some of Mr. Biden\u2019s lesser-known opponents haven\u2019t been so subtle.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan of Ohio told Bloomberg News in an interview last week that he thought Mr. Biden was \u201cdeclining,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think he has the energy. You see it almost daily.\u201d\n\nPressed by reporters Saturday on whether he still held that view, Mr. Ryan said in New Hampshire, \u201cI\u2019m not backtracking from it. It is a concern that we\u2019re hearing from a lot of people in the country and I don\u2019t think I need to bang everybody over the head with it.\u201d\n\nWrite to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com", "description": "Joe Biden is facing a test from Democratic primary rivals who are trying to put him on the defensive while they press for a next-generation candidate who could energize the party and defeat President Trump.", "authors": ["Ken Thomas", "Ken.Thomas Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105259/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
