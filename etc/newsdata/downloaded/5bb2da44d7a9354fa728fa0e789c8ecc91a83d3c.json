(Scott Suchman/National Symphony Orchestra)\n\nThis fall, Kevin Carlson, a trombonist, expected to be starting his senior year at the Juilliard School in New York. Instead, he\u2019ll be playing with the National Symphony Orchestra as assistant principal trombone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a leave of absence [from Juilliard],\u201d he says, \u201cin case things don\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nCarlson, just 23, is about to become the NSO\u2019s youngest player. He\u2019s one of four new members joining the orchestra as it prepares to start its season Saturday. He\u2019s also part of something of a sea change. Now at the start of his third season, Gianandrea Noseda, the NSO\u2019s music director, has overseen the hiring of 16 players \u2014 about one-sixth of the orchestra.\n\n\u201cUltimately, my goal as Music Director is to blend the energy of the new players with the existing traditions of the NSO in order to secure the future development of the orchestra,\u201d Noseda said in an statement.\n\nFor players, the NSO has become more appealing than ever. It has long been one of the best-paid orchestras in the country. Now, it\u2019s also seen as among the more dynamic ones. The orchestra is touring Asia this year, and a European tour is said to be in the works. It appeared at Carnegie Hall in the spring and will go to Lincoln Center in November. Selected performances are being streamed and distributed online on Medici.tv; others will be recorded, including the Beethoven cycle at the end of this season.\n\nAll of this activity is because of Noseda, who is popular with audiences, critics, orchestras and opera houses and who is ever more in international demand. More and more, the NSO is coming to reflect his approach.\n\nFor a young musician, even getting an audition is a victory. Tryouts often attract hundreds of players; the odds are against any one person landing a job with even a modest orchestra. Auditioning is an art in itself and a major focus of many instrumentalists\u2019 conservatory studies.\n\n\n\nKevin Carlson is a new trombonist with the NSO. (National Symphony Orchestra/Kennedy Center)\n\nMarina Aikawa is one of two new violinists with the NSO this season. (National Symphony Orchestra/Kennedy Center)\n\n\u201cI have taken like 10 auditions,\u201d says Marina Aikawa, a violinist who is starting with the NSO this fall and who studied at Juilliard, the Yale School of Music and the orchestral program at the Manhattan School of Music in New York.\n\n\u201cThe more you take, [the more] you know what to do. . . . It\u2019s just about experience. Some people get it their first shot, but, for me, I needed the experience.\u201d\n\nFor Aikawa, coming to the NSO closes a circle: It was the first American orchestra she heard live, shortly after her family moved from Japan to Virginia. (Her parents and brother are now back in Japan; she is excited about visiting them when the orchestra tours in the spring.) Aikawa even played at the Kennedy Center when she was 14 and a contestant in the NSO Young Soloists Competition, with her mother at the piano.\n\nBut Noseda was an equally important draw. Aikawa played under his baton last summer in the orchestra of the music festival in Verbier, Switzerland.\n\n\u201cSo I knew he was a great music director,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd he has a great personality, as well. I just look up to him so much.\u201d\n\nNoseda\u2019s magnetism has helped people leave other jobs, as well \u2014 from violinist Derek Powell, who joins the orchestra this fall from the U.S. Army Band, to violinist Ying Fu, originally from Shanghai, who in the middle of last season left the prestigious Philadelphia Orchestra and came to Washington with his pianist wife and 3-year-old daughter to take the long-vacant post of the NSO\u2019s associate concertmaster.\n\n\n\nYing Fu came to the NSO from the Philadelphia Orchestra. (National Symphony Orchestra/Kennedy Center)\n\n\u201cIt was pretty hard,\u201d he says of his decision to leave. \u201cPhiladelphia is one of the orchestras I always dreamed of playing with when I was young.\u201d\n\nFu cites two reasons for making the switch. One, he says, is the organization. \u201cI really like how the NSO runs. It\u2019s very organic, it\u2019s very smooth, you don\u2019t have too many struggles in doing your work.\u201d The Philadelphia Orchestra has been financially struggling and had a brief strike in 2016.\n\nThe other, he says, \u201cis Maestro Noseda. He used to conduct in Philadelphia a lot, but after he got this job, it\u2019s hard to book him, so it\u2019s nice to have another chance to work with him again.\u201d\n\nFu also is enjoying being part of an orchestra on the rise.\n\n\u201cRecently,\u201d he says, \u201cMaestro hired a lot of great musicians \u2014 violin section, oboe, horns. So it feels like they are trying to push the orchestra to another level, to make it more internationally known. The level is there. If you look at the players, they\u2019re at the same level as Philadelphia. . . . With Noseda\u2019s leadership, the whole orchestra has the desire to work together.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, he says, the fabled Philadelphia Orchestra is \u201ctrying to keep [its] good reputation, which is harder.\u201d Trying to live up to your own legend, in other words, is sometimes tougher than creating a new one.\n\nFor trombonist Carlson, who grew up on Staten Island in a family of engineers, it\u2019s amazing to have an orchestral job at all. \u201cI was the black sheep until I got into Juilliard,\u201d he says. There, his teachers included Joseph Alessi and Colin Williams of the New York Philharmonic \u2014 trombone royalty \u2014 and he also played with the prestigious National Orchestral Institute at the University of Maryland in 2017. Still, no one expects to land with a major orchestra on their first audition.\n\n\u201cIt was a two-day thing,\u201d Carlson says. \u201cThere is a preliminary round on the first day, because there are so many [people auditioning]. . . . After I got past the first round, I called my mom, and she was freaking out. I was like, \u2018Calm down.\u2019 She said, \u2018I know I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. But I\u2019m so excited for you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHaving won the job, Carlson returned to Juilliard to finish his junior year. But, he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t take classes too seriously after that.\u201d\n\nThe National Symphony Orchestra opens its season with a gala performance Sept. 28; its first subscription concert is Oct. 3. kennedy-center.org/nso.", "description": "Gianandrea Noseda has hired 16 new players in his first two years as music director.", "authors": ["Anne Midgette", "Classical Music Critic", "September At Pm", "Anne Midgette Came To The Washington Post In", "When She Consolidated Her Various Cultural Interests Under The Single Title Of Chief Classical Music Critic.
