Twitter\u2019s most recent banning was quite brief, as the memester was back and questioning his blacklisting with a tweet of a question mark.\n\nBreitbart News has reached out to Twitter for comment.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
