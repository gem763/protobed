While that's made steady-growth stocks expensive, Kostin says some still trade at reasonable prices.\n\nKostin says the trend and the valuation gap won't change soon because it looks like the US economy will keep growing at a slow pace, and in those circumstances, investors prefer growth stocks to value stocks.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nIs there a limit to how much investors will pay for steady, reliable earnings growth in an increasingly volatile market?\n\nIf there is, Goldman Sachs says we haven't found it yet. While stocks with steady profit growth are typically rewarded with higher valuations and those with volatile earnings trade at a small discount, David Kostin \u2014 Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist \u2014 says the gap between them has never been bigger. And he doesn't expect that to change.\n\n\"Investors currently pay a record-high premium for stocks with stable earnings growth vs. firms with more volatile growth,\" Kostin wrote in a recent client note. \"The most stable growers trade at a 23% valuation premium vs. the S&P 500, compared with a 25% discount for the most volatile growers.\"\n\nInvestors looking for a simple way to invest in high-quality companies with steady growth could consider the iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF.\n\nWhile growth stocks have crushed value stocks throughout the 10-year bull market, Kostin explains that the gap between the groups is actually getting wider as the economy slows. Since value stocks do best when the economy is growing very quickly or shrinking, he says, that's unlikely to change soon.\n\nRead more: The chief strategist at a $1.3 trillion brokerage breaks down how traders are using Roku as a pawn in the great streaming wars\n\n\"During periods of modest US economic growth (e.g. 0% to 3%, investors have typically assigned a scarcity premium to growth stocks that are able to generate idiosyncratic growth in excess of the economy,\" he said.\n\nDespite investors' ongoing craving for growth stocks and the huge valuation gap, Kostin says some companies still offer steady earnings growth at reasonable prices. He's compiled a group of companies listed that have 10 years of stable EBITDA growth, but trade at \"undemanding\" valuations compared to their peers.\n\nHe excludes companies that had suffered a stretch of poor earnings within the past five years and companies that are expected to have a bad year in 2020.\n\nThe stocks below are ranked in decreasing order, based on the standard deviation of their quarterly EBITDA growth over the past 10 years.
