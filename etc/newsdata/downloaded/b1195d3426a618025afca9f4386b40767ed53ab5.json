Her teammates then told her she had been disqualified because of her hijab.\n\n\"I felt like I had got hit by a truck and punched in the gut,\" Noor told the BBC's Outside Source programme.\n\n\"It's not because they're looking out for my safety, or because they are concerned that I have an advantage, because I definitely don't have an advantage wearing my hijab.\n\n\"I think it's discriminatory against my religion.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \u2018The power of the hijab for Muslim girls in sport\u2019\n\nNoor says she felt \"humiliated\" after the race, especially since officials said nothing to her beforehand.\n\n\"I looked like a clown running that race and I only ran it for those officials,\" she said.\n\nHer coach had failed to submit a religious waiver for the race, but has since filed one for Noor's upcoming regional competition, and OHSAA has accepted it.\n\nWhile the association's rulebook does not specifically mention hijabs, it states religious headwear requires a waiver, local media report.\n\nOHSAA told the BBC that they were \"looking at this specific uniform regulation to modify it in the future so that religious headwear does not require a waiver\".\n\n\"If the coach or school had obtained the waiver previously, all this could have been avoided. The race official was simply enforcing this rule.\"\n\nThe statement added that they had communicated with the school and were committed to educating coaches on all sport rules.\n\nImage copyright Facebook/Noor Alexandria Abukaram Image caption Noor during the Saturday race\n\nAn OHSAA spokesman told the Associated Press news agency that they had previously considered dropping the religious waiver requirement.\n\nThe spokesman also noted that the rule was not always enforced, including in some instances of runners wearing hats in cold weather.\n\nNoor believes no-one should have to sign a waiver for something like a hijab.\n\n\"They don't need to alter the course for me specifically. I'm running just like everyone else, I'm starting on the same start line and finishing on the same finish line.\"\n\nBut she says that she's seen a lot of positive feedback from her community, and across the US. Her cousin's initial Facebook post sharing Noor's story had over 2,000 likes and 3,000 shares as of Friday.\n\n\"I'm really happy that I decided to let this story go public because it really brings out a dialogue, and a lot of different people have been reaching out to me saying that similar things have been happening to them.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Massachusetts senator and 2020 Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren also weighed in, saying: \"Muslim students should never be denied participation in school activities.\"\n\nControversy surrounding around athletes and hijabs is not new.\n\nLast year, a 16-year-old basketball player in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was made to leave a game over her hijab, which prompted a statewide rule change.\n\nFemale athletes in particular have been singled out over strict dress codes.\n\nLast month, a teenage swimmer in Anchorage, Alaska, was disqualified after winning a race on the grounds that her school-issued swimsuit had exposed too much of her bottom.\n\nThe decision was overturned following public outcry.", "description": "The 16-year-old was not told that she would be disqualified over the hijab until after the race.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13E81/production/_109373518_24xp-hijab2-superjumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
