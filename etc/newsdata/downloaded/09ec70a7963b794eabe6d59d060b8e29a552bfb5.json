What the....?! Have complained! What eight-year-old needs to be paranoid about an \u201cuneven skin tone.\u201d\n\nAnd the BBC Radio 5 Live presenter's followers quickly took to the comments section to express their shock at the options on offer.\n\n'That's absolutely disgusting!! Yes WTF ,' raged one, while another wrote: 'Good grief. What an awful message to send to children. And from a school.'\n\nSam Walker, who is originally from the UK, took to Twitter to share the form her daughters brought home - which gave her the option to airbrush their school photos\n\nThe broadcaster posted a picture of the form and circled the options in yellow, highlighting there are two levels of airbrushing available (pictured)\n\nSam took to Twitter and told how she has since complained to the school. 'What eight-year-old needs to be paranoid about an \"uneven skin tone,\"' she added\n\nA third added: 'Yet another example of, \"Just because you can, doesn't mean you should,\" while a fourth added: 'Seems like a lot of hassle for whiter teeth and a couple of zits.'\n\nAnother who was left outraged by the suggestion went on to say how the entire point of a school photo is to 'look back and laugh at how goofy' they are.\n\n'I love the horrible lighting and flaws captured at Valentine Elementary School in San Marino, CA! Just BE kids!!' she continued.\n\nMeanwhile, others slammed the wrong message it is sending out to their children - who are young enough to still be in primary school.\n\nMany agreed that the option to airbrush is giving the wrong impression to young children across the globe\n\n'What does this teach children???? It\u2019s nonsense!!' wrote one, while a second added:\n\n'We were all paranoid about those things, but we didn't have the message shoved down our throats that these things are so important they need to be covered up for us to be seen public. I worry what Instagram is doing to kids.'\n\nMeanwhile, another took the opportunity to praise the photographer her granddaughter - who has scars on her chest - had at her school.\n\n'What a dreadful idea,' she said. 'Our granddaughter (5) had her school pictures done she has scars on her face and skin grafts on her chest.\n\n'The photographer did a brilliant job taking pictures of her not showing any of the burned areas, so it can be done with out the air brush.'", "description": "Sam Walker, who is originally from the UK but now lives in the US, has revealed her outrage after she was given the option to 'airbrush' her daughter's primary school photographs.", "authors": ["Chloe Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/18/20291924-0-image-a-49_1572286936915.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
