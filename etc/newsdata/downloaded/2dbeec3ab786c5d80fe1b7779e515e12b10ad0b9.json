Hence, one of the things that it had to settle was the auto-deleveraging section which governs counterparty liquidation. Looking at Binance\u2019s official page, however, we can see that it is entirely copied from that of their competitor \u2013 BitMEX.\n\nBinance Rips Off BitMEX AD Page\n\nA few days ago, Binance announced the so-called \u201cBattle for Binance Futures,\u201d launching two futures testnet platforms. Shortly after that, the exchange also acquired a crypto-asset derivatives platform in order to formulate a joint venture and foray into the field of cryptocurrency futures, options, and other derivatives.\n\nAmid all this, it appears that Binance had lost its sharp edge and created a separate page to explain how Auto Deleveraging (ADL) works.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s interesting to see that the entire page is pretty much copy-pasted from the same page that Binance\u2019s direct competitor in the field of crypto derivatives, BitMEX, has.\n\nNaturally, BitMEX was quick to pick this questionable, to say the least, move by Binance.\n\nCongrats on the Testnet Futures launches @binance. Glad to see you enjoyed reading our documentation as much as we enjoyed writing it! pic.twitter.com/lLzcLcX6t4 \u2014 BitMEX (@BitMEXdotcom) September 4, 2019\n\nIndeed, looking at the page, it is copied word for word with a few short exceptions. Given that BitMEX is in direct competition with Binance in the cryptocurrency derivatives market, it\u2019s very strange that the world\u2019s leading exchange has allowed for a rather silly mistake of the kind.\n\n\u201cShame On Us\u201d Zhao Says\n\nArthur Hayes, the CEO at BitMEX, staying entirely true to himself was quick to call out Changpeng Zhao, the CEO at Binance, saying that they can do better than that.\n\nZhao\u2019s response came rather swiftly. He said that the team missed this in the \u201cDD process\u201d prior to the acquisition and that they haven\u2019t read the BitMEX documents on their own.\n\nShame on us. \ud83d\ude02 Sorry about that. Missed this in the DD process before the acquisition (didn\u2019t read the BitMex docs ourselves). Will fix/remove ASAP. The official docs of Futures A platform (developed internally) are here: https://t.co/TPjvYgB2hr for your review. \u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) September 4, 2019\n\nNeedless to say, regardless of the reasons for the mistake, this doesn\u2019t do Binance any good. It\u2019s rather questionable why leading cryptocurrency exchange has allowed itself to rip off procedures of another one without adjusting them to their very own specifications.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "Just recently Binance acquired a crypto-asset derivatives trading platform and announced that it intends to foray into the field of cryptocurrency", "authors": ["George Georgiev", "View All Posts George Georgiev", "About The Author", "Georgi Georgiev Is A Seasoned Writer With Over Two Years Of Experience Writing About Blockchain", "Cryptocurrencies.
