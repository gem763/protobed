That's what we want.\n\n'He is a horse who is exciting for racing. At home he is physically getting stronger and he looks like a man amongst boys.\n\n'We hope he will go and live up to expectation and we can dream for his three-year-old career. If we get beaten we will have to regroup.\n\n'Thankfully the horse doesn't know what is spoken about him and carries on as the same relaxed character he has been in his career so far.\n\n'There are some fresh players on the pitch tomorrow and we respect them all..'\n\nThose fresh faces include Wichita, seven-length winner of the Tattersalls Stakes, and Mill Reef Stakes runner-up Mystery Power, who looked like a step up to seven furlongs would suit him.\n\nClive Cox-trained Positive has looked a very useful two-year-old, winning Sandown's Solario Stakes but he is a 16-1 chance after being beaten five lengths in Goodwood's Vintage Stakes.\n\nQuadrilateral does not dominate the picture for 1,000 Guineas for fillies like Pinutubo currently lords it over the colts but she strengthened her position as ante-post favourite with a head win from Powerful Breeze in the Bet365 Fillies' Mile.\n\nHaving looked in trouble two furlongs out, the Roger Charlton-trained filly clawed her way to the front to give jockey Jason Watson, last year's champion apprentice, his first group one win in Britain.", "description": "Trainer Charlie Appleby concedes expectations are sky-high for Pinatubo in Saturday's Group One Darley Dewhurst Stakes but is happy that preparations could not have gone smoother.", "authors": ["Marcus Townend For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19607112-0-image-a-44_1570828838990.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
