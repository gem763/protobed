A series of artful nude portraits, posted on the ESPN website, celebrate the body of a player born to be a basketball phenomenon.\n\nOne of those photos wound up on Cambage\u2019s shirt before today\u2019s game against the Washington Mystics, representing a literal and metaphorical flex from the 206cm baller.\n\nThe move was well received by fans online \u2013 with the exception of Mystics diehards, who essentially wanted their team to shut out the semifinal series.\n\nLIZ CAMBAGE IS WEARING A T- SHIRT OF HERSELF FROM THE BODY ISSUE pic.twitter.com/oXM8HTqDuv \u2014 whitney medworth (@its_whitney) September 25, 2019\n\nNobody Not a single soul Liz Cambage flexed on everyone and they mama by wearing herself posing naked on her shirt.

The Mystics won today\u2019s game 90-94, ending Cambage\u2019s season. Still, the Australian still managed to be the equal-highest scoring player on the court with 25 to her name, in addition to a game-high 12 rebounds.\n\nYou can read ESPN\u2019s excellent Body Issue profile of Cambage here.\n\nREAD MORE Liz Cambage Just Smashed A WNBA Record By Dropping 53 Points In One Game", "description": "Did the Las Vegas Aces lose against the Washington Mystics?
