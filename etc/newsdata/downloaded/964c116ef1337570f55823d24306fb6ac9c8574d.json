The authorities have destroyed domes and minarets on mosques, including one in a small village near Linxia, a city known as \u201cLittle Mecca.\u201d\n\nSimilar demolitions have been carried out in Inner Mongolia, Henan and Ningxia, the homeland of China\u2019s largest Muslim ethnic minority, the Hui. In the southern province of Yunnan, three mosques were closed. From Beijing to Ningxia, officials have banned the public use of Arabic script.\n\nThis campaign represents the newest front in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s sweeping rollback of individual religious freedoms, after decades of relative openness that allowed more moderate forms of Islam to blossom. The harsh crackdown on Muslims that began with the Uighurs in Xinjiang is spreading to more regions and more groups.\n\nIt is driven by the party\u2019s fear that adherence to the Muslim faith could turn into religious extremism and open defiance of its rule. Across China, the party is now imposing new restrictions on Islamic customs and practices, in line with a confidential party directive, parts of which have been seen by The New York Times.", "description": "A secret Communist Party directive has led to restrictions on Islamic practices far from Xinjiang, the western region where Uighurs have been brutally repressed.", "authors": ["Steven Lee Myers"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/world/00china-islam-top/00china-islam-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
