New housing starts rose for the first quarter in five in the three months to June.

June's quarterly total marks a 25 per cent decline on the near-62,000 total commencements chalked up in the peak March 2016 quarter.\n\nAnd while Wednesday's figures showed commencements of detached houses fell 10.6 per cent in the June quarter to 25,715, there are signs demand is picking up.
