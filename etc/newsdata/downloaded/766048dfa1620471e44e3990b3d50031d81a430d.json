The 13-year-old victim was taking a bath when the accused entered the bathroom and allegedly raped her.\n\n\"The victim's uncle, who stays in a back room in the yard, heard the minor crying and called other family members. After finding out what had happened to the victim, the uncle reported the matter to the police and the 42-year-old suspect was arrested.\"\n\nThe 13-year-old also claimed that this was not the first time that her stepfather had raped her, Funani said.\n\nThe accused is expected back in court on October 16 for a formal bail application.\n\nNorth West provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Baile Motswenyane condemned the incident, saying the police would do anything possible to ensure that the accused remained in custody.\n\n\"It is sad that the child was allegedly violated by someone who was supposed to protect her and that the incident took place amid calls for drastic action against perpetrators of gender-based violence,\" said Motswenyane.", "description": "A North West man who was left to care for his partner's three young children allegedly repeatedly raped one of them, the Stilfontein Magistrate's Court has heard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6080/d7464c91cf2e4e43955b8442a7187cd4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
