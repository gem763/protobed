Behind the hurricane, dry air moves in for our weekend on northwesterly breezes out of Canada. It looks potentially spectacular!\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Friday): It\u2019s mostly cloudy as Dorian passes to our east-southeast. A few gusty showers \u2014 maybe even a storm \u2014 are possible, especially in the morning, but nothing heavy, long lasting, or severe is currently expected. We could feel a tad clammy or muggy (low to mid-60s dew points) at times but at least high temperatures generally stick to the 70s. Temperatures might close in on 80 if we see more sun during mid- to late afternoon hours. Winds by midday may near 20 mph, with some gusts around 30 mph possible. It\u2019ll calm a bit by sunset. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: Shower chances \u2014 along with clouds \u2014 decrease. If not before sunset, quickly after it. Northeast breezes also continue to die down. Upper 50s to mid-60s looks to be our low temperature range, by just before dawn. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates.

High temperatures in the low to mid-80s should feel great! Right about average for this time of year, too. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Skies are mostly clear, so be sure to glance the waxing moon near Jupiter and Saturn. Northwesterly breezes may blow consistently around 5 mph, but that only helps upper 50s to mid-60s low temperatures feel that much more refreshing. Confidence: Medium-High\n\n\n\nA pedestrian walks through an alley Wednesday in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSunday: This has real potential to be another \u201cNice Day,\u201d with (almost crisp) temperatures in the upper 70s to low 80s. Dew points may dip toward the almost autumnal 50-degree mark. That\u2019s very dry September air for around here \u2014 boy oh boy! Cloud levels and breeze levels are a bit hard to pin down, but we may be able scour them out of the forecast as we get closer. Let\u2019s assume some clouds and breezes bubble up from time to time. Get outside, regardless. Just use a bit of sunscreen midday! Confidence: Medium\n\nSunday night: Another familiar low temperature range, with upper 50s to mid-60s likely by around dawn. Skies may gradually cloud up overnight, with a slight shower chance before daybreak. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nCloudier but still comfortable upper 70s to low 80s for Monday and Tuesday. Only slowly does noticeable humidity return, by Tuesday, with dew points in the mid-60s possible. Hit-or-miss showers, even a couple thunderstorms, are possible. Especially with a weak disturbance trying to move through later Monday. Stay tuned to forecast tweaks as we get closer.
