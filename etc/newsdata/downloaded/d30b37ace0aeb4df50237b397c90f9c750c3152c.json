This is not the time for a general election. This is a time for cool heads and grown-up Government.\n\nMr Hammond told Ridge on Sunday: ' I will vote against it. This is not the time for a general election. This is a time for cool heads and grown-up Government'\n\n'Parliament has indicated clearly that it is willing to support this deal. The Prime Minister said he wants a deal. These deadlines - October 31 - are meaningless.\n\n'The key thing now is to get the deal properly scrutinised in Parliament. That doesn't mean delaying it by months, it means giving Parliament a few days, a couple of weeks, to scrutinise the Bill, amend it if necessary and then we can make progress.\n\nThe Tories are up three points on 40 per cent, which Jeremy Corbyn 's Labour remains stuck on 24 per cent as he continues to dither over Mr Johnson's offer of a pre- Christmas election\n\n'The Government should stop making threats, stop throwing tantrums, and get on with the grown-up business of doing its business. Just because it can't get exactly what it wants doesn't mean it should stop working.'\n\nHe added that the UK could leave the EU by the end of November 'if the Government just stops messing about'.\n\nMr Hammond, who quit the Cabinet in July before Mr Johnson took office, lost the Tory whip last month.\n\nHe indicated that if there was a general election he would run in his Runnymede and Weybridge seat as an independent, adding that he would not seek to 'curry favour' with Boris Johnson in order to be able to run as a Tory.\n\nHe said he he 'probably would not' back a second referendum amendment to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, but could support a customs union.\n\nBoris Johnson's Conservatives opened up a 16-point lead in the polls today, in a sign that the public backs the Prime Minister's attempt to break the Brexit deadlock.\n\nThe Tories are up three points on 40 per cent, which Jeremy Corbyn's Labour remains stuck on 24 per cent as he continues to dither over Mr Johnson's offer of a pre-Christmas election.\n\nThe opposition leader needs to decide by tomorrow what his party will do when Mr Johnson calls a vote for a general election and a change to pass his Brexit deal.\n\nThe poll by Opinium for the Observer also shows Mr Johnson is seen as the best leader by more than twice as many people as Mr Corbyn is, with a 39 per cent approval rating compared to 16 per cent for the Labour man.\n\nBoris Johnson opens up 16-point lead in the polls as he tries to find a solution to Brexit with Jeremy Corbyn dithering over whether to back a general election Boris Johnson's Conservatives opened up a 16-point lead in the polls today, in a sign that the public backs the Prime Minister's attempt to break the Brexit deadlock. The Tories are up three points on 40 per cent, which Jeremy Corbyn's Labour remains stuck on 24 per cent as he continues to dither over Mr Johnson's offer of a pre-Christmas election. The opposition leader needs to decide by tomorrow what his party will do when Mr Johnson calls a vote for a general election and a change to pass his Brexit deal. The poll by Opinium for the Observer also shows Mr Johnson is seen as the best leader by more than twice as many people as Mr Corbyn is, with a 39 per cent approval rating compared to 16 per cent for the Labour man. The PM has also seen a boost in support for his Brexit deal, with 29 per cent now seeing is as a good deal, up from 23 per cent last week. However the percentage who though it was a bad deal also rose from 21 to 23 per cent. Adam Drummond, head of political polling at Opinium, said: 'Another week and the story remains largely the same with the Tories cementing the Leave vote while the Remain vote is both divided and underwhelmed with the options available to it. 'The Conservatives have hit the symbolically important 40 per cent mark for the first time since before missing the Brexit deadline back in March and the reaction to Boris Johnson's deal appears to be that the public are divided on whether it will be good (although probably bad for the economy) but more want MPs to vote for it than vote against it. 'To the extent that there is a way out of the impasse, a general election is the most popular individual outcome but, if Johnson's deal were put up against the option of remaining in the EU in a binary referendum, the country remains just as evenly split as it was last time we asked.'\n\nCould there be a general election on December 9? No 10 says it will consider backing Lib Dem and SNP-style plan to sideline divided Labour and break the Brexit deadlock\n\nBritain's chances of having a general election in early December increased today after the Government hinted today it could support opposition parties' efforts to sideline Labour and break the Brexit deadlock.\n\nA No 10 source today suggested Boris Johnson would look at a proposal similar to that suggested by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party if a planned Commons vote tomorrow fails.\n\nBoris Johnson will ask MPs to agree on Monday to back his proposal for a December 12 election under the Fixed Term Parliament Act (FTPA), but is expected to be defeated.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has so far insisted that Boris Johnson must rule out a No Deal Brexit before he supports an election, something the PM will not do.\n\nThe rival plan supported by Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon is for a bill that would allow Mr Johnson to secure a December election with a simple majority of MPs, by-passing the need for two-thirds support under the FTPA.\n\nThis means it would have a chance of passing without Labour support.\n\nBut the No 10 move comes after senior ministers had branded the Lib Dem plan a 'stunt' and a 'gimmick' in live television interviews.\n\nThe Number 10 source said: 'Tomorrow MPs will vote on an election on December 12 so we can get a new Parliament.\n\n'If Labour oppose being held to account by the people yet again, then we will look at all options to get Brexit done including ideas similar to that proposed by other opposition parties.'\n\nMrs Morgan told Sky's Ridge on Sunday: 'What is different about the offer, or stunt I might say, by the SNP and Lib Dems is they have obviously made it clear that they have no intention of wanting Brexit to be done, no intention of wanting the Withdrawal Bill'\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson appeared to try to assuage Tory fears that the rebel bill could be amended to introduce things like votes at 16 when she appeared on the BBC\n\nCulture Secretary Nicky Morgan had earlier hit out at the scheme. But she refused to confirm that the Government would vote against it, saying it would have to wait and see what is in the paperwork.\n\nThe draft law would grant an election on December 9 - three days before the PM's proposed date and, crucially, when more students are still at university to cast their votes in Remain-supporting target swing seats.\n\nMrs Morgan told Sky's Ridge on Sunday: 'What is different about the offer, or stunt I might say, by the SNP and Lib Dems is they have obviously made it clear that they have no intention of wanting Brexit to be done, no intention of wanting the Withdrawal Bill.\n\n'They are saying, ''Go for an election''. It may well be that an election is going to happen.\n\n'If the SNP and Lib Dems want an election then they have a chance to vote for one as quickly as tomorrow when the Government's motion is voted on.\n\n'We will see if they are in our lobby or not.'\n\nDiane Abbott told the BBC a short time later that Labour would be prepared to 'discuss' the bill with the Lib Dems\n\nParty chairman James Cleverly later appeared to more firmly slap down the bill, telling the BBC: 'It's clearly a gimmick. It moves the election date by three days and takes the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (Wab) completely off the table.\n\n'If they really want to vote for an election they can vote for the bill we put forward.'\n\nBut Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson appeared to try to assuage Tory fears that the rebel bill could be amended to introduce things like votes at 16 when she appeared on the BBC.\n\nIn a sign that she was prepared to work with the Government to get the bill through she said: 'I recognise the time pressure that we are under right now doesn't give us that luxury - January 31 isn't that far away.\n\n'I think we have to pass this as it is drafted. We cannot assume we will keep getting an extension to Article 50. We do need to resolve this issue.'\n\nScottish First Minister Ms Sturgeon tweeted today: 'Doing nothing allows Johnson to get his bad deal through (with Labour support) or, even worse, run down clock to end January when No Deal becomes a real risk all over again\n\n'Re a People\u2019s Vote, I\u2019ve strongly supported that and the SNP would vote for it - but there\u2019s no evidence that the majority for it exists within this Parliament.\n\n'And if there is an extension to Jan 31, the clock starts ticking again immediately. We have no time to waste.\n\n'For all his bluster, Johnson would much prefer to fight an election with Brexit already ''delivered''.\n\n\u2018An election now would instead force him to explain his failure to keep his 31 October ''do or die'' promise and also defend his bad deal.\u2019\n\nThe Prime Minister used an article in the Sunday papers to accuse MPs of holding the country 'hostage' by refusing a general election.\n\nHe is looking to pile pressure on parliamentarians to give him the two-thirds backing he needs on Monday to secure a trip to the polls.\n\nMP Chuka Umunna said the Lib Dems had offered a general election because it looks 'highly unlikely' that a second referendum can be secured under the current numbers\n\nBut the Lib Dems and SNP, in a move that circumvents Labour's indecision, are to reportedly set to offer the Conservative Party leader an even easier route to an election, requiring just a simple majority in the Commons.\n\nMP Chuka Umunna said the Lib Dems had offered a general election because it looks 'highly unlikely' that a second referendum can be secured under the current numbers.\n\nThe time frame involved for a December 9 election would not allow Mr Johnson to 'ram' through his Withdrawal Agreement Bill before polling day, he said.\n\nHe also looked to allay Tory fears and said adding new elements such as votes for 16-year-olds would be 'outside the scope of the Bill'.\n\nHowever, Labour indicated it would vote against the bill, with shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth telling Ridge it was an 'opportunistic stunt'.\n\nHe added: 'I mean it's entirely ridiculous. It would need cross-party support to get through the House of Commons procedures and then it would be subject to all kinds of amendments, particularly when it gets into the House of Lords.\n\nIan Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, confirmed he had co-signed a letter with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson to European Council president Donald Tusk asking for a Brexit delay until January\n\n'It's just a stunt so the Lib Dems can get on the telly today.'\n\nBut his frontbench colleague Diane Abbott told the BBC a short time later that Labour would be prepared to 'discuss' the bill with the Lib Dems.\n\nHowever she said that the idea of telling the EU how long a Brextension the UK wanted could be 'problematic'.\n\nIan Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, confirmed he had co-signed a letter with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson to European Council president Donald Tusk in which they sought an extension until January 31 at the earliest so that the 'risk of a devastating no-deal Brexit' could be removed.\n\nHe added: 'If that meaningful extension is secured we will then work together to bring forward an election this year - but on Parliament's terms, not on the Prime Minister's.'", "description": "The former Tory said he wanted a Brexit deal done before voters go to the polls and said there was a need for 'cool' heads in the Government.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/09/20237780-0-image-a-20_1572166850989.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
