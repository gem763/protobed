Signing Elliott would give Cowboys a third RB, not to mention their MVP. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) August 31, 2019\n\nAlso on the roster is fullback Jamize Olawale, per The Athletic\u2019s Jon Machota.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting the Cowboys\u2019 53-man roster at this point last year also featured only two running backs in Elliott and Rod Smith, but that was the benefit of having a do-everything player like Elliott. Tony Pollard and Alfred Morris don\u2019t quite cover that ground.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nElliott has made clear he desires to become the NFL\u2019s highest-paid running back, which means the Cowboys would have to top Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley\u2019s four-year, $60 million deal. The Cowboys were previously reported to have offered Elliott top-two money (read: second) among running backs.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the Cowboys and Elliott have made progress, but it seems a holdout that has gotten quite personal might be nearing its end.\n\nThe Cowboys have left a very Ezekiel Elliott-shaped hole on their roster.
