Kelvin Ansari gave his son advice about life in phone conversation hours before death", "language": "en", "text": "Kelvin Ansari\u2019s children are hard-pressed to remember a time when their father was not in uniform.\n\nDuring his 21 years with the U.S. Army, Ansari served tours in Kuwait, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF 'BLUE LIVES LOST'\n\nHis dedication to public service inspired him to become a police officer in 2008, and the 50-year-old Georgia native rose to the position of sergeant last year.\n\n\u201cHe was in uniform \u2013 with the Army, then the police department \u2013 all my life,\u201d said his son, Kelvin Ansari, Jr. \u201cWe were comfortable with it. He fought in different wars, we saw him as Superman. His whole tenure, I don\u2019t remember any close calls. We were used to him always returning.\u201d\n\nOn May 10, Kelvin, who is 26 and lives in New York, spoke with his father on the telephone.\n\nHis father, in his characteristic philosophical way, dispensed some pearls of wisdom to his son, including, \u201cRemember, your reputation precedes you.\u201d\n\nTwenty-four hours later, the elder Ansari was fatally shot as he tried to arrest a robbery suspect.\n\nOFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY IN 2019\n\n\u201cMy dad was just approaching the car and this guy just hopped out of the car and shot my dad,\u201d Kelvin Jr. said, still trying to understand what will never make sense.\n\nHe is left with special memories. And regrets.\n\nHe remembers his father, who loved to tinker with electronics, helped him build his first computer.\n\n\u201cHe was always trying to fix or build something,\u201d said Kelvin, an artist. \u201cHe was very hands-on. If he didn\u2019t know how something worked, he just had to figure it out.\u201d\n\nHe recalls how his father, who loved to reflect, always had a special space wherever they lived where he retreated for some quiet time. And there was the Boyz II Men Barber Shop in Savannah where his father took him and his brother to get their hair cut when he returned from an Army tour in Germany.\n\nAnd then there are the regrets -- things left unsaid and undone on the belief that there always will be tomorrow.\n\n\u201cI wish I had reached out to him more,\u201d his son said, \u201cthat I had made more of an effort. I have found out that he also wanted to start reaching out to me more. I was busy, he was busy. I was the child who had left the South and moved away. I think of all the things I never got a chance to do with him, like travel, have a real vacation with my dad. He loved to travel. That\u2019s why my last conversation with him hurts so much.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe played phone tag for a long time before we finally got to have that last conversation, and the words he said to me, \u2018Remember, your reputation precedes you,\u2019 permeate through me.\u201d\n\nWhen he reached Savannah after his father died, Kelvin Jr. realized the impact Ansari had on the community.\n\nMemorials to his father are everywhere in Savannah, including near the Boyz II Men Barber Shop, in front of which his father was killed.\n\nHis elementary school art teacher had her class work on a portrait of Sergeant Ansari, and local artists created paintings and drawings in his honor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA little boy ran a mile carrying a Blue Lives Matter flag in Ansari\u2019s honor and recorded a video message praising his service to the country and the community.\n\n\u201cThe Savannah Police Department and Savannah in general have been so supportive,\u201d his son said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten social media messages \u2013 in the thousands \u2013 from people I\u2019ve never met. I\u2019m so thankful that he is remembered like that.\u201d", "description": "Kelvin Ansari\u2019s children are hard-pressed to remember a time when their father was\u00a0not in uniform.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Llorente"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/Kelvin-Ansari.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-09"}
