The past year of political wrangling over Brexit has plunged the British pound to its weakest value in a generation and dealt another blow to London\u2019s already depressed real estate market.\n\n\n\nAt the moment, Americans, as well as Saudis and Emiratis, two Arab nations with currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, enjoy the steepest discounts in London compared to the last market peak in 2014, according to an analysis by Mansion Global and Dow Jones market data analysts, which looked at currency fluctuations for a dozen major players in the London market.\n\n\n\nMore: Amid Political Changes, Buyers Would Be Wise to Consider Prime Central London\n\nAmerican buyers in the U.K. are paying roughly one-third less than they were five years ago thanks to favorable shifts in the exchange rate. The benefit, of course, isn\u2019t limited to Americans, per se, but any buyer with U.S. dollars to burn, including any U.K. expatriate getting paid in greenbacks.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t news to the droves of such buyers who\u2019ve already descended on the London property market, according to Edward Heaton, founder and managing partner of buying agents Heaton & Partners.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is evidence of a definite pickup in activity in prime central London at the moment, predominantly from international buyers, who are very open that they believe the combination of a weak sterling and low prices make this the perfect time to buy,\u201d Mr. Heaton said. \u201cTheir view is that post-Brexit, regardless of the outcome, that both prices and sterling will pick up.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrices in some pockets of central London have fallen as much as 20% to 30% off their 2014-15 peak, which when coupled with the weak sterling \u201chas created the opportune moment for foreign buyers to purchase property at pretty much half the price compared to five or six years ago,\u201d Mr. Heaton added.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese buyers are taking the view that regardless of the type of Brexit we have, the world is not going to come to an end; London will still be a place to park money,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMore: Forget Perfectly Timing the Market and Focus on What You Can Do Instead\n\nLooking at it another way, in 2014, a U.S. buyer with a budget of US$1 million could maybe cover the cost of a 500-square-foot studio in St. John\u2019s Wood\u2014a popular London neighborhood for American expats in London, according to Mansion Global\u2019s calculation using average price-per-square-foot data from firm LonRes. These days, that exact same budget will, on average, cover 700 square feet due to a stronger dollar and a dip in neighborhood home prices.\n\nOther Currencies Also Benefit\n\nNo U.S. dollars? No problem. A strong Hong Kong dollar is also handing residents a major discount on U.K. property at a critical time for residents of the semi-autonomous Chinese city. A favorable exchange rate gives the U.K. housing market particular appeal, as violent clashes between political protestors and police spur affluent Hong Kongers to seek safe havens abroad, Mansion Global has reported.\n\n\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar now stretches 34% further than it did at the height of the London market in 2014, according to our analysis.\n\n\n\nMore: For a Safer Bet in a Tough Luxury Market, Consider the Penthouse\n\nSimon Deen, director of London-based property agency Aston Chase, said the firm was involved in five deals involving buyers from Hong Kong since the beginning of September, including a \u00a310.75 million sale at the Corinthia Hotel\u2019s private residences in Westminster.\n\n\n\n\u201cDespite the short-term issues with Brexit, they still see London as a good solid base to invest their capital, and also a place to live and educate their children,\u201d said Mr. Deen.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the buyers from Switzerland, another major player in the London housing market, are seeing a 27% discount on the exchange rate compared to five years ago, followed by Singaporeans with a 22% discount.\n\n\n\nMany agents and market analysts have credited an influx of foreign buyers\u2014cognizant of the investment opportunity in London\u2014with driving high-end deals in recent months. A number of these buyers have shown a particular interest in new developments, which has attracted the likes of billionaire American hedge funder Ken Griffin. He\u2019s reportedly agreed to buy a \u00a3100 million penthouse at the still under-construction Peninsula Hotel in Belgravia.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the super-rich, if something fits the bill, they\u2019ll buy it,\u201d regardless of stamp duty or Brexit, said Gary Hersham, founder of Beauchamp Estates.\n\n\n\nBetting that things could get any better for certain foreign buyers is unwise, he added.\n\n\u201cYou can never trade at the bottom and you can never trade at the top, so it\u2019s not prudent to wait,\u201d Mr. Hersham said.\n\n\n\nMore: Rising Rents, Wary Buyers Means Now Might Be the Time to Buy an Investment Property\n\nSome Remain on the Sidelines\n\nSo why might foreign buyers sit on the sidelines despite the dramatic currency discounts?\n\n\n\nFor one, not every currency has strengthened against the pound. The Australian dollar, for example, has not strengthened against the pound like other major currencies over the past five years. And Russian buyers\u2014once an incredibly important driver of ultra-prime home sales in London\u2014have seen their spending power plummet about 24% since 2014, according to our analysis.\n\n\n\nBesides that, there are two main reasons would-be buyers with the means in London have until now opted not to act, agents say.\n\n\n\nThe first is a desire for more political clarity surrounding Brexit, which as of now has a deadline of Oct. 31. Domestic buyers, as well as foreign buyers that need to sell in order to buy, could make a case for holding off if clarity helps bolster home sales and prices.\n\n\n\nBut the uncertainty is exactly what\u2019s working in foriegn buyers\u2019 favor at the moment. The pound is expected to strengthen with greater political and economic clarity, particularly if a trade deal is struck, and would thereby chip away at the exchange rate advantage first-time U.S. or EU buyers, for example, now enjoy.\n\n\n\nThe second bet some would-be overseas investors are making is that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will follow through on vague promises to reform property transfer taxes, known as stamp duty. That includes the possibility of slapping the seller rather than the buyer with the tax bill.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, lawmakers implemented a graduated stamp duty tax with a top rate of 12% on the price of a home over \u00a31.5 million, and then added another 3% for all second-home purchases two years later.\n\nBut those successive stamp duty hikes have already weighed on the housing market to the point that sellers have largely swallowed the added cost through deflated home prices, said Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, a Mayfair-based estate agency.\n\n\n\nIn effect, Mr. Wetherell said in an email, \u201cwe already have a tax on the vendors because the values of property have been affected by the stamp duty and land tax.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut dreams of stamp duty reform are likely just that, as lawmakers will be hesitant to deprive the government\u2019s general fund of the additional revenue enjoyed since the tax was raised in 2014. There\u2019s little-to-no chance Mr. Johnson\u2019s administration will get around to minor policy reforms like stamp duty until Brexit is well behind us.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Melinda Gates Commits $1 Billion to Advance Gender Equality in U.S.\n\nAnd if the case for investing now wasn\u2019t already strong enough, international buyers who choose to finance their home purchase can borrow at record-low rates, as Chris Sykes, a mortgage consultant for lender Private Finance, recently noted.\n\n\u201cWhile home-movers might be tempted to maintain their \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach in the face of this political uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Sykes wrote in market commentary, \u201cthey should also recognize that this uncertainty is also presenting value and opportunity across the housing market, which isn\u2019t guaranteed to be sustained in the long-term.\u201d\n\n\n\nClick for More In-Depth Analysis of Luxury Lifestyle News\ufeff", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-113359?size=1.4988290398126465&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
