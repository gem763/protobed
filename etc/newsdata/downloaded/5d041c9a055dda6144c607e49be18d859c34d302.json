Photo: Walt Disney Television Photo Archives/Walt Disney Television via Getty\n\nThis morning when I was catching up on the news, I saw two things you don\u2019t see every day. The first was a Jimmy Carter story, relating the former president\u2019s comment that he could not have done a good job as Chief Executive at the age of 80, which is the landmark Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would reach in a first term if elected in 2020. Since Carter went on to suggest these two old birds were in fact his favorites for the nomination, I chose not to write up his apparently humorous endorsement of an age limit.\n\nThere was also a UFO story, courtesy of the United States Navy, as CNN reported:\n\nThe US Navy has finally acknowledged footage purported to show UFOs hurtling through the air. And while officials said they don\u2019t know what the objects are, they\u2019re not indulging any hints either.\n\nThe objects seen in three clips of declassified military footage are \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena,\u201d Navy spokesperson Joe Gradisher confirmed to CNN.\n\nThe clips, released between December 2017 and March 2018 by To The Stars Academy of Arts & Sciences, appear to show fast-moving, oblong objects captured by advanced infrared sensors.\n\nHere\u2019s the best part:\n\nTwo of the videos, both from 2015, contain audio from US fighter pilots attempting to make sense of what they\u2019re seeing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a f****g drone, bro,\u201d a pilot says to his colleague in the first clip.\n\n\u201cMy gosh! They\u2019re all going against the wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at that thing, dude!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t write about that, either, because, well, I had no idea what it meant.\n\nBut then late today when looking at that old reliable source This Day In History, I found a eery coincidence: a Jimmy Carter UFO Story. Seriously:\n\nFuture President Jimmy Carter files a report with the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) on September 18, 1973, claiming he had seen an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) in October 1969.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign of 1976, Democratic challenger Carter was forthcoming about his belief that he had seen a UFO. He described waiting outside for a Lion\u2019s Club Meeting in Leary, Georgia, to begin, at about 7:30 p.m., when he spotted what he called \u201cthe darndest thing I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d in the sky. Carter, as well as 10 to 12 other people who witnessed the same event, described the object as \u201cvery bright [with] changing colors and about the size of the moon.\u201d Carter reported that \u201cthe object hovered about 30 degrees above the horizon and moved in toward the earth and away before disappearing into the distance.\u201d He later told a reporter that, after the experience, he vowed never again to ridicule anyone who claimed to have seen a UFO.\n\nThat would have been while he was serving as Governor of Georgia.\n\nBut even the usually unusually honest Carter backtracked on UFO candor after his rise to national power:\n\nDuring the presidential campaign of 1976, Carter promised that, if elected president, he would encourage the government release \u201cevery piece of information\u201d about UFOs available to the public and to scientists. After winning the presidency, though, Carter backed away from this pledge, saying that the release of some information might have \u201cdefense implications\u201d and pose a threat to national security.\n\nSounds like they got to Jimmy Carter before he blew the whistle.", "description": "On a day when there was a Jimmy Carter story and a UFO story, I discovered that on this day in history in 1973 Jimmy Carter reported seeing a UFO, leading to a pledge to release intel on UFOs if elected president, which he did not do.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/18/18-jimmy-carter.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
