He would scream every 10 to 15 minutes and I would be up and down all night without fail comforting him.\n\n\"My husband Josh works nights, so to settle all four children on my own was a task in itself, and I'd spend over an hour every night trying to appease everyone.\n\n\"I really was at my wits end.\n\n(Image: OLIVIA BUNCE/ MERCURY PRESS)\n\n\"But my new routine is working wonders - I feed him, give a baby massage, pop him in his pyjamas and then use the pillow spray five to 10 minutes before bed and slowly settle him down for the night.\n\n\"He nods off almost instantly, sleeping through from 9pm for eight hours every single night I've used it.\"\n\nChloe had been trying to find new ways to help Joshua sleep on his own for a while, and stumbled across the pillow spray, with the Very Hungry Caterpillar packaging catching her eye.\n\nAfter the magical results wowed her, the mum-of-four decided to invest in a bottle for herself and her three other children, Brooklyn, 12, Ava-Lily, eight, and Mila, five.\n\n(Image: OLIVIA BUNCE/ MERCURY PRESS)\n\nThe spray is fragranced with Sicilian lavender, ylang ylang, jasmine, amber and mandarin.\n\nChloe said: \"I'm absolutely over the moon with the pillow spray, it has completely changed Joshua's bedtime routine and he is a much happier and more settled baby.\n\n\"My husband didn't believe me until I started sending him pictures of Joshua fast asleep and now we've bought one for our bed and our other three children.\n\n\"Before using the spray, I had no time for myself both during the day and in the evening.\n\n\"Now Joshua is falling asleep at 9pm, I have time to do face masks and paint my nails.\n\n(Image: OLIVIA BUNCE/ MERCURY PRESS)\n\n\"I can spend time with my other children in the evening too and it finally means that when Josh has nights off we get some time to ourselves.\n\n\"I'm in a much better place mentally, and have been enjoying TV series, reading to the girls and I'm generally content knowing I can get in bed and have a good night's sleep.\n\n\"The household is a much brighter place!\"\n\nChristina Moss and Julia Yule, co-founders of Bloom and Blossom, added: \"With five children between us, we know the trials and tribulations of settling into a bedtime routine all too well, and we're delighted that Chloe has found a solution with our pillow spray.\n\n\"We often hear from parents struggling with their little one's sleep and if we can help even a few mums and dads to create more positive bedtime routines, then we've done our job.\"\n\nTo view the full selection of Bloom and Blossom products, go to bloomandblossom.com .", "description": "Mum Chloe says her son Joshua now sleeps for eight hours every night without fail - and has even dubbed the spray her 'magic potion'", "authors": ["Hollie Bone", "Image", "Olivia Bunce", "Mercury Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20583127.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-MIRACLE-SPRAY-SENDS-BABY-TO-SLEEP-EIGHT-HOURS-A-NIGHT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
