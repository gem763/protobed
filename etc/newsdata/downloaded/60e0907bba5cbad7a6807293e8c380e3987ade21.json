REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund is set to postpone its plan to raise its funding quotas, or voting shares, that would see China replace Japan as the second-most-influential voice at the body, a Japanese official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe plan will be shelved due to stiff resistance from the United States, the official said on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media.\n\nWashington, which as the largest shareholder in the global lender wields an effective right of veto, has previously expressed opposition to increasing the IMF\u2019s overall funding and shareholder quotas, a move that would also reshuffle voting rights.\n\nVoting power in the body is tied to what proportion of funding a member contributes, and that proportion is in turn linked to the member\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe Group of 20 major economies pledged in June, at their financial leaders\u2019 meeting in Japan, to conclude the 15th general review of quotas no later than the IMF annual meetings scheduled to take place next week.\n\nThe G20 urged the IMF to expedite its work on resources and governance reform as a matter of the highest priority.\n\nThe fund, hoping to boost its ability to respond to financial crises, has set a goal to decide by this autumn whether to increase funding, as well as how much to raise quotas by and the proportion of each member\u2019s contribution.\n\nThe IMF last decided to increase funding quotas in 2010, which was implemented in 2016. China first overtook Japan as the world\u2019s second largest economy in the latter months of 2010.\n\nJapan has held the second position in terms of funding quotes, and therefore voting rights, since 1992. However, its proportion of funding has slipped to 6.46% from 6.56%. China\u2019s contribution has jumped to 6.39% from 4%, rising from sixth to third place.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund is set to postpone its plan to raise its funding quotas, or voting shares, that would see China replace Japan as the second-most-influential voice at the body, a Japanese official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438448608&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970W3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
