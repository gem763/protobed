If you saw 9to5Google's hands-on video with a leaked Pixelbook Go prototype, the new Chromebook from Google shouldn't be much of a surprise.\n\nStill, official details are best, and Google announced its new Pixelbook Go Chromebook during its event in NYC on Tuesday.\n\nThe Pixelbook Go is a 13-inch Chromebook that's 13mm thin, weighs two pounds, and is housed in a magnesium outer shell. Google says the laptop has a 12-hour battery life.\n\nIt'll be available in two colors, including \"just black\" and \"not pink,\" and it starts at $650. Google will start taking pre-orders on Tuesday, but it's not yet clear when the laptop will begin shipping.", "description": "Google unveiled a brand-new Pixelbook laptop at its big hardware event in New York City on Tuesday morning.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5d70c4af9092ef524f3b4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
