On top of that, closed-door depositions and the release of a series of text messages bolstered the case further.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry has paid off so far. And now, the House effort is poised to intensify further in coming days as investigators seek to meet with diplomats, including the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine -- who was reportedly removed by Trump because she failed to facilitate an investigation of Biden.\n\nTrump even appeared resigned to the likelihood of his impeachment -- which would be the third in American history -- as he spoke to reporters on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats, unfortunately, they have the votes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey could vote very easily.\u201d\n\nThe House opened its inquiry with a probe of Trump\u2019s conduct in a July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. After freezing military aid to Ukraine, which is battling a Russia-backed insurgency, the American president asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, one of Trump\u2019s top Democratic rivals in the 2020 presidential contest.\n\nTrump claims that Biden improperly helped his son Hunter profit from business deals in Ukraine and China. The allegations related to Ukraine have been discredited, and those related to China aren\u2019t supported by publicly known details. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has dismissed the allegations as without merit.\n\nTrump suffered his biggest setback this week with the release of the text messages. Those included U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker telling a Ukrainian official he had \u201cheard from the White House\u201d that a Zelenskiy trip to Washington was conditioned on the Ukrainian leader convincing Trump he\u2019d \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of a probe Trump sought into the 2016 election.\n\nOther texts showed U.S. and Ukrainian officials brokering a proposed announcement of investigations into a Ukrainian gas company that employed Hunter Biden, and alleged electoral interference aimed at undermining Trump. There were also internal exchanges between two Trump administration officials debating whether security assistance from the U.S. would be conditioned on investigations.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d U.S. Charges D\u2019affaires in Ukraine Bill Taylor wrote in one message. The other official said there was no such quid pro quo but then urged an end to text exchanges on the matter.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, said in a letter to colleagues that the communications were alarming.\n\n\u201cThese text messages reflect serious concerns raised by a State Department official about the detrimental effects of withholding critical military assistance from Ukraine, and the importance of setting up a meeting without further delay,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe president on Friday reiterated his insistence that there hadn\u2019t been any improper pressure, and said he was motivated by rooting out corruption, not winning an election. But when asked by a reporter if he\u2019d ever pressed a world leader to investigate impropriety not related to one of his political enemies, Trump said he would need to check.\n\nAlso this week, congressional investigators unveiled documents showing Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, leaned on the State Department to investigate conspiracy theories related to Biden and Ukraine.\n\nAides to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo cautioned against unfounded reports suggesting that the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine was a hotbed of Democratic support, according to the documents.\n\nIn early May, the State Department unexpectedly recalled Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, whom Giuliani falsely accused of helping bring to light secret payments made by the party of Ukraine\u2019s then-President Viktor Yanukovych to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Trump said Thursday that he\u2019d heard \u201cvery, very bad things about her.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump\u2019s battle against an accelerating impeachment inquiry is growing tougher after a week of damaging revelations and self-inflicted wounds that emboldened Democrats and put the White House on defense.The president added to the frenzy by publicly calling on Ukraine and", "authors": ["Justin Sink"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
