At 2:30 p.m. local time, it was 99 degrees (37 Celsius) in Doha with a \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature of 122 (50 C). The forecast for the midnight race through downtown Doha is 89 (31.6 C).\n\nThere are 69 women on the start list, planning to race against each other and tackle conditions they rarely face. Meet organizers will have extra medical staff on the course looking for signs of heat exhaustion.\n\nInside the open-roofed stadium, where air conditioning is keeping the track about 20 degrees cooler than in the city where the marathon will be run, the meet will start Friday evening with qualifying for the men\u2019s 100 meters. Defending champion Justin Gatlin, American Christian Coleman and Canadian Andre De Grasse are among the medal contenders.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The midnight marathon is going on as scheduled at the steamy track and field world championships in Qatar.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
