He was a friend of Yuri Gagarin, who became the first man in space in 1961 and trained with him.\n\nHe was selected to perform the first spacewalk as the Soviet Union and United States, Cold War foes, were locked in a frantic race to conquer space.\n\nAfter 18 months of intensive training Leonov was ready to become the first man to float in space.\n\nOn March 18, 1965, at the age of 30, he made history when he left a spacecraft during the Voskhod 2 mission for a spacewalk that lasted 12 minutes and nine seconds.\n\n\"(There was) an inky black, stars everywhere and the sun so bright I could barely stand it,\" Leonov told AFP in 2015 when he was a sprightly 80-year-old.\n\nTethered to the craft with a 5m long cord, he gazed in wonder at Earth's geography laid out sweepingly below him.\n\n\"I filmed the Earth, perfectly round, the Caucasus, Crimea, the Volga. It was beautiful.\"\n\nLeonov and another cosmonaut, pilot Pavel Belyayev, orbited at a distance of 500km from Earth.\n\nThey completed the first ever spacewalk 10 weeks before the United States repeated the feat.\n\nTheir mission was declared successful even though Leonov experienced several mishaps.\n\nTheir return to Earth nearly ended in tragedy when Leonov and Belyayev were forced to crash land in a forest some 180km from the Urals city of Perm.\n\nRescuers only found the crew four hours later.\n\nTribute in outer space\n\nA decade later in 1975 Leonov commanded the Soyuz 19 spacecraft which docked with the US Apollo spacecraft in the first joint space mission between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nLeonov celebrated his 85th birthday on May 30 and cosmonauts Kononenko and Alexei Ovchinin dedicated a May spacewalk to him, taking a picture of him into space and wearing spacesuits with birthday greetings written on the back.\n\nPutin also congratulated Leonov at the time, calling him \"a worthy representative of the legendary team of Soviet cosmonauts\".\n\nLeonov was an accomplished artist and writer and his contemporaries described him as warm and likable.\n\n\"It's a huge tragedy for us all,\" said the wife of fellow cosmonaut Boris Volynov, Tamara Volynova.\n\n\"Alexei is a unique person,\" she told AFP.\n\nHe helped many cosmonauts and was a \"great story-teller\", space historian Alexander Glushko said.\n\nHe also helped US astronaut Tom Stafford adopt two Russian boys.\n\nLeonov will be laid to rest at a cemetery just outside Moscow on Tuesday.", "description": "Alexei Leonov, a legendary Soviet cosmonaut who was the first man to perform a spacewalk in 1965, died in Moscow, aged 85, after a long illness.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9467/653ad44c794640189ea6f3be6bfc5b02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
