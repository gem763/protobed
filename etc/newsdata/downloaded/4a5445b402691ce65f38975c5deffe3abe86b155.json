Will users trust the company with their secrets?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nFacebook's new dating feature is now live in the United States. (Images courtesy of Facebook)\n\nDo you trust Facebook with your most intimate secrets?\n\nThe social media giant wants you to do just that with the matchmaking service it launched in the United States this week, despite its spotty record with privacy, advertising and disinformation.\n\nUsers 18 and up can now opt into Facebook Dating from the main menu on their app or desktop, creating a new profile separate from the one their friends currently see. After that, Facebook suggests matches to other users based on \u201cpreferences, interests and other things you do on Facebook.\u201d Those suggestions do not include existing Facebook friends.\n\nForget swiping left or right: Facebook daters comment directly on the profile or use the traditional \u201clike\u201d button.\n\nThere\u2019s also a \u201cSecret Crush\u201d feature that allows the user to select up to nine Facebook friends or Instagram followers. If one of those individuals also uses Facebook Dating and has added the user to their Secret Crush list, a notification is sent to both individuals.\n\n[Facebook\u2019s new dating feature: Your 7 burning questions, answered]\n\nFacebook says the new service will give its users a better chance to get to know potential matches\u2019 authentic selves. But it\u2019s unclear how many users will trust Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social media platform with 1.2 billion daily users, with powering their love lives.\n\nThat\u2019s in large part because the company has come under fire in recent years for multiple scandals involving misinformation, fake accounts and breaches of trust. A 2016 ProPublica investigation found that Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude users by race. In 2018, a whistleblower revealed that Facebook allowed political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to improperly access data from millions of users. Late last year, the New York Times reported that Facebook had hired an opposition research firm to discredit critics by linking them to philanthropist George Soros.\n\nOn Wednesday, TechCrunch reported a security researcher found an easily accessible database online containing hundreds of millions of phone numbers associated with Facebook accounts.\n\n[Facebook\u2019s dating service is a chance to meet the catfisher, advertiser or scammer of your dreams]\n\nWhile other dating apps and sites have built a $3 billion industry using personality data for matching and marketing purposes, experts worry that Facebook \u2014 with its enormous audience and sophisticated ad-targeting platform \u2014 could amplify opportunities for abuse.\n\nA scamming problem already exists on the platform, privacy watchdogs say. The new service could expose users to additional hoaxes including those who disguise their identity to prey on susceptible people. It could also result in helping advertisers use sensitive information to target vulnerable individuals.\n\nIn a blog post, Nathan Sharp, Facebook Dating\u2019s product manager, wrote that \u201cSafety, security and privacy are at the forefront of this product,\" and that the design of the service includes the ability to report and block any user, a prohibition on sending photos, videos or payments over messages, and easily accessible safety tips.\n\nThe service, which was announced more than a year ago, is now available in 19 countries including Canada, Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines. It\u2019s coming to Europe by early next year.\n\n[Would you confess your secret crush to Facebook?]\n\nThe new service could also heighten another common problem in the online dating world: an increasing prioritization of physical attractiveness over other important qualities, said Marsha Winer, owner of the San Francisco-based matchmaking service Introductions by Marsha.\n\nThat\u2019s a trend she\u2019s seen accelerate over her 36 years in the business as more and more apps focus on choosing a partner largely based on profile photos. She believes Facebook Dating will encourage more of the same. Single people nowadays, said Winer, \u201cput so much emphasis on the picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re discounting so many good possibilities,\u201d she added.", "description": "The company that brought you Cambridge Analytica wants to find you a soul mate.", "authors": ["Marie C.
