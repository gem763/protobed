It operates buses, trams and ferries and on-demand shuttles in Australia, and expanded into New Zealand in August after buying bus services in Auckland and Wellington.\n\nThe Moovizy app on trial in France's St Eitienne gives users many different transport options.\n\nExpanding cities like Sydney need to provide multi-modal transport options, particularly to people living far away from city centres, he said. \"It's becoming a key element of the quality of life.\"\n\nIn France, Transdev is using buses to get people living in rural areas to train stations.\n\nBuses with wifi now pick up passengers from parking lots near freeways that lead into Paris from the south and take them to the high-speed train station at Massy. This system has reduced congestion around train stations, Mr Mallet said.\n\nTransdev is increasing the number of electric buses it operates today from 600 (including 200 around Amsterdam's Schiphol airport) to an expected 1400 by 2023.\n\nIt is also experimenting with autonomous vehicles in partnership with carmaker Renault in the French city of Rouen.\n\nAutonomous cars and shuttles are likely to work best if they are used on dedicated lanes or dedicated zones so that they can be monitored with cameras from a control room that can slow the vehicles down or stop them if necessary, Mr Mallet said.", "description": "Cities, not Google, should tell residents the best ways of getting around, says Transdev's global CEO.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.3403%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_27%2C$y_137/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9b4f6dcc455231d75f29df4c2f4c02a918be2492", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
