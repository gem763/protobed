XRP price must surpass $0.2950 and $0.2980 for a decent rally.\n\nRipple Price Analysis\n\nRecently, ripple declined below the $0.2850 support area against the US Dollar. However, the $0.2810 area acted as a support and XRP price started a fresh recovery. The price gained momentum above the $0.2850 resistance. Moreover, there was a break above the $0.2920 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price even spiked above the $0.2950 resistance, but it failed to surpass the $0.2980 resistance.\n\nA high was formed near $0.2977 and the price is currently correcting lower. It is trading below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent leg from the $0.2813 low to $0.2977 high. Currently, it seems like the $0.2900 area and the 100 hourly SMA are protecting declines. The next key support is near the $0.2895 level. It represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent leg from the $0.2813 low to $0.2977 high.\n\nAny further losses might push ripple price towards the key $0.2850 support area in the near term. On the upside, there is a strong resistance near the $0.2950 and $0.2980 levels. Moreover, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2950 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. Therefore, an upside break above the $0.2950 resistance may perhaps open the doors for a fresh increase.\n\nHaving said that, the price must gain strength above $0.2980 to continue higher. The next key resistance is near the $0.3040 level (the previous swing high). Finally, if the bulls gain momentum above $0.3040, the price could recover towards the $0.3100 area.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price is clearly facing a major hurdle near the $0.2950 and $0.2980 levels. If there is a successful close above $0.2950 and a follow through above $0.2980, the price could continue to rise in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is struggling to gain in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is currently just near the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.2900, $0.2850 and $0.2800.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.2950, $0.2980 and $0.3040.", "description": "Ripple price is making attempt to clear a few key hurdles against the US Dollar, while bitcoin is recovering.
