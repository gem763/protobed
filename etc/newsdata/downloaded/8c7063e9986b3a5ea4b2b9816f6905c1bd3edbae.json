The sudden collapse has left many workers desperate and with no income.\n\n'Unite is determined to get these workers the wages they're owed. We are also urging banks, mortgage lenders and landlords to give these workers the breathing space they need to get back on their feet.\n\n'Unite stands shoulder to shoulder with the workers' calls for the directors to hand back their bonuses and will put pressure on this Government to bring in legislation to ensure that a company collapse of this kind is never again allowed to happen.'", "description": "Rachel Murrell, 41, a member of the Unite union, set out from Devon last Friday walking 25 miles a day to highlight the plight of the 9,000 workers who lost their jobs.", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/21/19314280-0-image-a-5_1570220014813.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
