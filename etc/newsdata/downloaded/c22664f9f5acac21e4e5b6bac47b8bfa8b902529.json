They believe they know better than you, and your listeners, and the voters how the country ought to be run. At this moment in time, the deep state has a knife aimed at the heart of American democracy, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing playing across your TV screens and newspapers pages and online, with these so-called whistleblowers, who are, of course, in fact, angry hate-filled rage-driven bureaucrats determined to take down the President of the United States and illicitly and improperly using the Whistleblower Protection Act in order to effectuate their designs.\u201d\n\nMiller continued, \u201cOne of the gravest threats that we face today \u2014 and I can\u2019t emphasize this enough \u2014 to our republican form of government is the unelected deep state, and I\u2019ll explain what I mean by that. The Constitution of the United States, Article II, states very clearly that, and this is a quote, \u2018The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\u2019 What that means is that the whole executive power is vested in one democratically elected person: the president. The president, who is accountable to the voters \u2014 the president, who is accountable to the American people, holds and wields the executive power. Every other person in the federal government in the executive branch is an extension of his authority, is acting as an extension of his authority delegated to them. They have no independent authority. So when a deep state bureaucrat says, \u2018I don\u2019t want Donald Trump to be president. I don\u2019t want to effectuate his policies. I don\u2019t want to carry out his agenda, so I will do the opposite,\u2019 they\u2019re violating the Constitution and they\u2019re taking away the power of the American people to elect who heads the executive branch and what policies they implement.\u201d\n\nMiller said what Trump is facing would be the equivalent of a member of Congress having disloyal staff forced on them from their predecessors \u2014 people working to undermine that member\u2019s wishes on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cImagine, as an example, if a U.S. senator or congressman was elected but was saddled with staff from the previous senator or congressman that worked against them night and day to block them from carrying out the legislative agenda they campaigned on,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWould anybody ever tolerate that? This is the same thing happening in the executive branch, now, but played across thousands of people seated throughout the federal government, and I\u2019ve seen this firsthand.\u201d\n\nMiller said in his years at President Trump\u2019s side, he has seen up close and personal what \u201cdeep state saboteurs\u201d do when they disagree with Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cWhen we hold interagency briefings, and you\u2019ll invite career folks on, like, for example, working on an issue like, say, refugee policy, and if they don\u2019t like the direction you\u2019re taking, they will leak and spin and lie about the contents of your meetings,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey\u2019ll take it to the Washington Post and the New York Times and to MSNBC. They\u2019ll share private documents, they\u2019ll share private emails, they\u2019ll share private correspondence, and then they\u2019ll spin and fabricate and lie to create their desired narrative to try to steer policy in the direction they want to steer it in, and the most dangerous expression of this \u2014 of course, we\u2019ve seen \u2014 has been in the intelligence community, which is amassed with awesome power, awesome capabilities, and they\u2019re directing that and wielding that \u2014 in some cases \u2014 against a duly-elected President of the United States of America, which is a form of sabotage that should terrify everyday American citizens. That is now the situation we find ourselves in.\u201d\n\nMiller continued by noting that the reason these actors continue to attempt to undermine Trump is because Trump has completely upended the failures of both major political parties over the past several decades in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe last point I\u2019ll make about this is the why,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhy? Because this president dared to disrupt two-party betrayal of the American people over many decades: betrayal on trade, betrayal on China, betrayal on foreign policy, betrayal on our southern border, betrayal on our economy, decade after decade, year after year, administration after administration. This president dared to stand up to defy that betrayal \u2014 was elected to end that betrayal \u2014 but the people who profited like parasites off of that betrayal are now the ones trying to prevent him from executing the agenda that the American people installed him to execute. That\u2019s the situation we find ourselves in today.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Miller pointed to several specific examples of saboteurs before these current so-called whistleblowers who used their positions in government to attempt to undermine Trump\u2019s policies. At the very beginning of the administration was Sally Yates, the acting attorney general of the United States during the earliest days of the Trump administration, who refused to enact the lawful order of the travel ban at the beginning of the administration. Trump fired her as a result and then, later, the travel ban was implemented \u2014 and upheld as lawful by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cSally Yates, yeah, Sally Yates, let\u2019s hit on that,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSally Yates refused to carry out a lawful order of the president. And then she received an email \u2014 this was from back in reference to the travel ban case \u2014 she received an email from Andrew Weissman who later found himself on Mueller\u2019s team telling her something to the effect of \u2018I\u2019ve never been more proud of you than I am today.\u2019 That\u2019s not an exact quote but it\u2019s the general spirit of it \u2014 that gives you some insight into how the deep state operates.\u201d\n\nMiller noted that there are millions of people who work for the federal government and the vast majority of them do their job and do it well. But then there are people like Peter Strzok, the now-former FBI agent whose text messages with Lisa Page \u2014 his lover and an FBI attorney \u2014 demonstrated that the two of them were part of a broader effort to misuse the federal government perches from which they sat to attempt to create an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d against Trump to hurt him.\n\n\u201cYes, there are millions of people who are employed by the federal government and are contracted with the federal government, and enormous numbers of them are extremely patriotic people, but we also know that in the Beltway of Washington, DC, in the Maryland-Virginia area that federal employees tilt overwhelmingly left, and while a good number of them are able to set aside their personal feelings to carry out their jobs, there is quite a number of them who are not so willing, and those of them who have great power have the potential to do extraordinary damage, and exhibit A in this case is Peter Strzok,\u201d Miller said. \u201cLook at the emails and text messages Peter Strzok was sending. And, by the way, those were only the emails and text messages he was sending on his government device. The person at the center of the Clinton investigation and the 2016 investigation \u2014 on his government device \u2014 was texting hateful thoughts \u2014 terrible plots \u2014 against the president and the president\u2019s supporters.\u201d\n\nIf it was not for those text messages becoming public, Strzok would have gone on working for the FBI and probably would have continued working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team. He was removed for bias when those messages were revealed, and Miller makes the case that there are many more like him throughout the government.\n\n\u201cTo the point about it being a deep state, who in America knew who Peter Strzok was before the text messages came out?\u201d Miller said. \u201cSomebody that labored behind closed doors, probably worked in secret without ever giving a sign to anyone around him but secretly working against this president, only looping in the people that he felt needed to know, now exposed to the world. But how many more Peter Strzoks are there throughout this government \u2014 throughout the intelligence community \u2014 that are doing the exact same thing that he\u2019s doing, yet unknown and undetected? We can be certain that a few of them now are filing themselves as whistleblowers.\u201d\n\nNow that there are anonymous so-called \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d from that same deep state who have \u2014 without revealing their identity while pushing false allegations against the president \u2014 sparked impeachment proceedings against the president, Miller said it is an outrage.\n\n\u201cIt violates every notion of due process at the center of the American system of government and based upon, by the way, a conversation that we can now all read for ourselves \u2014 that we can now all see for ourselves \u2014 in an unprecedented show of transparency,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe president was doing nothing more than carrying out his lawful obligation as president to root out and uncover corruption, duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United States including the laws against corrupt practices and now is facing a Pelosi-led legislative coup. It\u2019s beyond comprehension.\u201d\n\nTo fight back against this, Miller called on all Americans to stand with President Trump.\n\n\u201cWhat people need to do is they need to support our president,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe battle lines are drawn. Support our president. And, tell your members of Congress that they need to support our president too. That is the single most important thing you can do.\u201d\n\nMiller also predicted a \u201cTsunami-sized backlash against the Democrats\u201d for jumping the gun on impeachment and moving forward without the transcript or the complaint, both of which prove the president\u2019s innocence of the claims against him.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff should not be allowed in polite society,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe should be relegated to wearing a tin-foil hat. He was the lead proponent of this ludicrous Russia conspiracy theory against our president that has been so systematically debunked, and dismantled, and disproven at every turn but again pushed from the beginning by permanent bureaucrats and their Democrat co-conspirators. Again, the situation is indeed a grave one \u2014 but there will be a tremendous backlash against the Democrats. But understand this, for the Democrats, they want to stop this president because they want to stop his policies. They want to force back onto you open borders. They want to subjugate you under a regulatory regime that crushes your liberties. They want to enmesh in foreign conflicts all around the world. And they want to keep us in a state of economic serfdom to foreign countries trade-cheating and mercantilist policies. So, this is about the sovereignty, security, independence, and freedom of the American people.\u201d\n\nMore from Miller\u2019s exclusive interview with Breitbart News Sunday is forthcoming.", "description": "Stephen Miller joined Breitbart News Sunday to expose the deep state: forces driving the effort by Democrats to proceed with impeachment.", "authors": ["Matthew Boyle"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/washdc-us-capitol-building-storm-clouds-filephoto-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
