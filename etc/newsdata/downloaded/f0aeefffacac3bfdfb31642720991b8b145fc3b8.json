Other applications had not arrived in time, he added.\n\nMagufuli agreed to extend the amnesty for another seven days until October 6.\n\n\"I urge you, the DPP and other responsible organs to hasten the process and set these people free once they completed the payment,\" said Magufuli.\n\n\"After that period, make sure you deal with new economic crime cases in accordance with normal legal procedure. I don't want to reach a point where people would be thinking that there is no more economic crime in Tanzania.\"\n\nIn a similar initiative earlier this month, the Tanzanian parliament amended criminal laws to allow for plea bargaining in certain crimes in a bid to reduce backlogs in the judicial system.\n\nIt allows the accused to negotiate with prosecutors and plead guilty for a more lenient sentence.\n\nThe new legislation came after several such special agreements with prosecutors.\n\nIn April, leading mobile phone service provider Vodacom, agreed to plead guilty and pay 5.28 billion Tanzanian shillings to the government after its managing director, Hisham Hendi, and four other executives were charged with economic crimes.", "description": "Tanzania's president John Magufuli has announced an extension to an economic crimes amnesty after prosecutors were flooded with 467 requests in the initial seven-day period.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7935/2b1fb04657754b54a0d2908b20efbb5a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
