The permit expires in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe strive to build sustainability into everything that we do, and our data centers are no different,\u201d Google said in a statement to The State. \u201cWe\u2019ve been proud to call South Carolina home for more than ten years, and we\u2019re proud of the investments that we\u2019ve made here, including more than $2 billion in capital investment, supporting employment opportunities, municipal improvements, educational programs and local nonprofits.\u201d\n\nGroundwater withdrawals are a source of growing concern in South Carolina as demands on aquifers, large subterranean water supplies that line the state\u2019s coastal plain, rise. Besides Google, megafarms in the center of the state have also come under scrutiny for their water use.\n\nCritics of DHEC\u2019s said Google could get cooling water from rivers in the area rather that siphon off drinking water.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2019 have a beef against Google itself, but I don\u2019t think it is appropriate to use pristine groundwater for cooling computers, versus providing that water for people,\u2019\u2019 Clay Duffie, manager of the Mount Pleasant Waterworks that draws water from the ground and a local river, told The State. \u201cWe are obviously concerned about the [long-term], safe sustainable yield of that aquifer.\u201d", "description": "South Carolina on Wednesday approved allowing Google to pump nearly 550 million gallons of drinking water per year to cool its servers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/google_060618getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
