Options range from a turbulent no-deal exit to abandoning the whole endeavour.\n\nJohnson says he wants to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal with the bloc. But he lost his parliamentary majority this week and expelled 21 lawmakers from his ruling Conservative Party\u2019s group in parliament after they supported an opposition plan to try to bloc a no-deal exit.\n\nJohnson says the only solution is a new election, which he wants to take place on Oct. 15, allowing him to win a new mandate with two weeks left to leave the bloc on time. He needs two-thirds of parliament\u2019s lawmakers to back an early election.\n\nBut opposition parties, including the Labour Party, said they would either vote against or abstain on calls for an election until the law to force Johnson to seek a Brexit delay is implemented. Johnson failed to win enough support in a vote on Wednesday for an election.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn held a call with other opposition leaders on Friday to discuss their plans.\n\n\u201cNO LONG WAIT\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will have that election when the time is right but I will make you this promise, we are not going to have a long wait,\u201d the leader in the British parliament of the opposition Scottish National Party, Ian Blackford, told BBC television, adding that his party would oppose it on Monday.\n\nThe opposition bill, which would force Johnson to seek a three-month Brexit delay, was approved by parliament\u2019s appointed upper chamber, the House of Lords, on Friday. Queen Elizabeth is expected to sign it into law on Monday.\n\nOpposition lawmakers say they are wary of approving an election, which would mean parliament would be dissolved. They want to ensure parliament can still sit in October to ensure Johnson complies with the law requiring he delay Brexit.\n\nThe leader of Welsh party Plaid Cymru\u2019s British parliamentary group, Liz Saville Roberts, told Sky News this meant an election would have to be after Oct. 31.\n\nJohnson, a leader of the Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum who took office in July after Theresa May quit having failed three times to get a Brexit deal through parliament, has said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit.\n\nHe says he wants a deal with Brussels but would be willing to leave without one, and has cast the bill aiming to stop a no-deal Brexit as a surrender to the EU.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go to Brussels, I\u2019ll get a deal and we\u2019ll make sure we come out on October 31, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d Johnson said during a visit to a farm in Scotland.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson visits Darnford Farm in Darnford, Banchory near Aberdeen, Scotland, Britain September 6, 2019.

But the issue could be taken to the Supreme Court for a final appeal.\n\nJohn Major, a former Conservative prime minister who supported the court challenge against suspending parliament, said Brexit was a deceit that would undermine the United Kingdom\u2019s standing and could even split it asunder.\n\n\u201cBrexit will reduce our global reach, not enhance it,\u201d Major said. \u201cOnce outside Europe, we British will have little or no voice. We are not used to being outside the inner circles of decision-making \u2013 and we will hate it.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nMajor said Johnson should fire Dominic Cummings, the advisor behind his high-stakes Brexit strategy whom Major cast as a \u201cpolitical anarchist\u201d.\n\nWhen asked about Major\u2019s call, Cummings told Reuters: \u201cReally?
