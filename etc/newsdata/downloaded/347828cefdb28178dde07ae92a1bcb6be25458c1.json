Star shortstop Carlos Correa was late covering a base. There was a wild pitch, too.\n\nIt was perhaps the poorest inning of the season for the 107-win Astros, and came at the most inopportune time.\n\nThe result: The Nationals swiftly added five more runs and were well on their way to a 12-3 win and a 2-0 Series lead.\n\nKurt Suzuki\u2019s leadoff homer in the seventh off Justin Verlander put the Nationals up 3-2. By the time Suzuki grounded out to end the inning, there were sarcastic cheers from the fans, many of them already in the aisles and heading out of Minute Maid Park.\n\nAll season, Hinch\u2019s aversion to intentional passes had been something of an amusement to statheads. The Astros hadn\u2019t issued one since Aug. 17, 2018, when reliever Hector Rondon put on Oakland\u2019s Jed Lowrie.\n\n\u201cWe see the downside of it. Clearly I think there\u2019s a lot of downside given that I haven\u2019t done it all year,\u201d Hinch said after this loss.\n\nIntentional walks became an official statistic in 1955. The Astros set the record for fewest last year with only four, then lowered it even more.\n\n\u201cSome of it is comfort with what I\u2019ve learned on adding runners on base for free,\u201d Hinch said late this season, explaining why he eschewed the strategy.\n\nBut no doubt, no one imagined that one free runner would turn into something like the Nationals put together after Soto\u2019s stroll.\n\nWashington manager Dave Martinez, meanwhile, wasn\u2019t surprised to see it.\n\n\u201cI had a feeling once first base was open,\u201d he said.\n\nHowie Kendrick kept things going, driving in a run with an infield single that kept eluding Bregman. Two more scored on a single by Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera, and two more came home when Ryan Zimmerman dribbled an infield single that Bregman threw past first base.\n\n\u201cClearly that inning didn\u2019t go that way, nor did the next inning, nor did the next inning after that,\u201d Hinch said.\n\nAll after that little walk in the park.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At this rate, AJ Hinch might never issue another intentional walk the rest of his life.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ben Walker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/world_series_nationals_astros_baseball_17325_c0-115-2763-1726_s1200x700.jpg?62cd6c34eed95923c14059dc7444e1422428dc97", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
