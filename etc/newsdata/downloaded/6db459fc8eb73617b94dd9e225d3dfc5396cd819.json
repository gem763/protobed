The fire was aimed at causing chaos within a sewing workshop to distract guards and aid the prisoners' escape attempt, authorities said.\n\nHe was already serving time for attempted murder after shooting a North Carolina state trooper at close range in 2013. At the time of the shooting, he was a fugitive from Vermont wanted on a probation violation.\n\nJurors viewed a video in which Brady told investigators he was upset over his nearly 25-year sentence and felt he had nothing to lose. He said he thought about escaping for months before making the break.\n\nCorrections Enterprises Manager Veronica Dardenwas identified as one of four victims brutally murdered by four inmates during a botched escape from the Pasquotank Correctional Institution in 2017\n\nCorrections Officer Justin Smith was identified as one of four victims brutally murdered by four inmates during a botched escape from the Pasquotank Correctional Institution in 2017\n\nCorrections Officer Wendy Shannon was identified as one of four victims brutally murdered by four inmates during a botched escape from the Pasquotank Correctional Institution in 2017\n\nMaintenance worker Justin Smith was identified as one of four victims brutally murdered by four inmates during a botched escape from the Pasquotank Correctional Institution in 2017\n\nBrady described the attack on one of the victims in the interview describing how the inmates attacked one of the corrections officers -- Shannon -- and hit her until she 'stopped.'\n\n'Until she stopped what?' the interrogating law enforcement officer asked.\n\n'Moving,' Brady replied.\n\nJurors also saw prison camera photos of the four prison workers lying in pools of blood as Brady and others armed with hammers or scissors stood over them, The Virginian-Pilot reports.\n\nPrison understaffing at the time of the assault was so severe that workers cut corners in ways that endangered personnel, an evaluation team from an arm of the US Justice Department found in a report released last year.\n\nA quarter of the jobs at the Pasquotank prison were vacant, and the reliance of managers on staff overtime led to burnout and complacency, the National Institute of Corrections report said.\n\nUnderstaffed prison workers failed to keep track of tools, metal shards and hazardous chemicals, the report said.\n\nDoors were left unlocked, and inmates roamed unobserved near the sewing plant where the fire was set and created undiscovered hiding places outside the view of video cameras.\n\nDarden, head of the sewing plant, was 50. Howe, who was in maintenance, was 31. The corrections officers Smith and Shannon, were 35 and 49, respectively.", "description": "Mikel Brady, 30, is the first of four North Carolina inmates accused of murdering four prison workers during a botched escape.
