The complainant, a U.S. intelligence official, further accused senior White House officials of a cover-up, saying they \u201cintervened to lock down all records of the phone call.\u201d\n\nRead a redacted version of the declassified complaint below.\n\nTrump used the phone call with the Ukrainian leader \u201cto advance his personal interests,\u201d the whistleblower wrote, citing \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\u201d\n\nThe president, the complaint said, \u201cis using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals. The President\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General (William P.) Barr appears to be involved as well.\u201d\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee released the declassified complaint after reportedly receiving it from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cIt is a travesty that it was held up this long,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThis complaint should never have been withheld from Congress. It exposed serious wrongdoing, and was found both urgent and credible by the Inspector General.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThis complaint is a roadmap for our investigation, and provides significant information for the Committee to follow up on with other witnesses and documents. And it is corroborated by the call record released yesterday. ... The public has a right to see the complaint and what it reveals.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham shrugged off the complaint, claiming \u201cnothing has changed\u201d with its release.\n\nThe complaint is \u201cnothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings \u2015 all of which shows nothing improper,\u201d Grisham said in a statement.\n\nSchiff\u2019s committee also released a letter from Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nThat letter, dated Aug. 26, describes the complaint as \u201ccredible\u201d and of \u201curgent concern\u201d and notifies Maguire that the law requires him to pass along the complaint to congressional intelligence committees within seven days.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s legal team applauded the decision to declassify the complaint, telling The Hill on Wednesday that the document \u201cestablishes that, ultimately, the lawful whistleblower disclosure process can work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe await the release of the complaint in its totality,\u201d the attorneys told The Hill.\n\nThe Trump administration, under bipartisan pressure, provided the then-classified complaint Wednesday to congressional intelligence committees, who had for days been urging Maguire to comply with the law and release it. Maguire had initially refused, and Schiff first heard about the complaint earlier this month after the inspector general for the intelligence community told him Maguire was sitting on it.\n\nThe unnamed whistleblower first filed the document in August, several weeks after a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nA reconstruction of the phone call released by the White House on Wednesday details multiple instances in which Trump pressured his counterpart to investigate the family of one of his main political rivals, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden. During one point in the call, Trump asked the Ukrainian president for a \u201cfavor\u201d shortly after Zelensky brought up U.S. military aid that had been provided to the country.\n\nThe inspector general determined that the complaint was \u201ccredible\u201d and of \u201curgent\u201d concern, and many Democrats who have seen it have echoed those sentiments.\n\nAttorneys for the whistleblower told The New York Times on Wednesday that their client hoped to remain anonymous as any investigation into the matter continues. The lawyers were working with lawmakers and the White House to determine how the person could speak with members of Congress.\n\n\u201cIntelligence officers, by nature, are not people who want to be publicly known,\u201d Andrew Bakaj, the lead lawyer for the person, told the Times. \u201cIf you are an intelligence officer through and through, you are doing this for national security.\u201d\n\nThere was already support from both parties to release the complaint to the public, including from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.).\n\nSoon after reports of that call were revealed, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday that a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump would begin. Those calls continued to grow after the documents were made public, and as of Wednesday evening, a majority of the House supported the decision to open the inquiry.\n\nRead a redacted version of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint below:\n\nThis is a developing story.
