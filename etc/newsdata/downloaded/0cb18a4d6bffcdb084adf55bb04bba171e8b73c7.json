Wales' Josh Adams in action REUTERS/Peter Cziborra\n\nFrance coach Jacques Brunel said on Friday that his team knew exactly what to expect from the Welsh at Oita Stadium, a suffocating defensive blanket, pressure applied at the set piece with the occasional burst of individual brilliance.\n\nAdams, who will go into the match as the tournament\u2019s joint leading try-scorer with five in four matches including a hat-trick against Fiji, said that assessment was possibly outdated.\n\n\u201cMaybe in the past we\u2019ve kept games a little bit closer and kicked a little bit more ball, but that\u2019s dependent on the gameplan and how we look at the opposition,\u201d Adams told reporters on Saturday.\n\n\u201cYou identify areas where you can put teams under pressure, and if that\u2019s keeping things tight with the forwards and putting more boot to ball that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\n\n\u201cI definitely think in the last four games we\u2019ve moved the ball quite well, and have scored some good tries, actually. It\u2019s another string to our bow.\u201d\n\nWales will go into the match with plenty of confidence having won all four pool matches and beaten France in seven of their last eight meetings.\n\nCoach Warren Gatland said on Friday that they had yet to put in a complete 80-minute performance in Japan and Adams said getting all facets of their game working was part of the quest for that.\n\n\u201cWe not only can grind teams down with the pack we\u2019ve got, dominate aerially with the kicking game, we can also move the ball around and use our threats in the backs,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to keep teams guessing sometimes, whether we\u2019re going to come hard with the pack or shift it wide, but it\u2019s another string to our bow. It\u2019s all about trying to get a complete game.\n\n\u201cYou never will, but it\u2019s trying to get as close as you can to that.\u201d\n\nThe winners of Sunday\u2019s quarter-final will play South Africa or Japan in the last four.", "description": "Wales have developed more variety in their game and France are in for a surprise if they go into Sunday's World Cup quarter-final expecting a one-dimensional approach from the Six Nations champions, winger Josh Adams said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442574465&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I04V", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
