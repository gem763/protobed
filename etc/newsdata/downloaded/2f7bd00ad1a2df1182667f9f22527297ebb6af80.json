Bush. She is a CNN national security analyst. Follow her on Twitter @sam_vinograd.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s revolving door took another spin earlier today, when President Donald Trump announced that he asked Ambassador John Bolton to resign from his position as national security advisor. Bolton is Trump\u2019s third National Security Council chief to cycle out and was reportedly fired because of his policy differences with the president. (Bolton said he chose to resign.)\n\nSome have openly worried about what Bolton\u2019s departure could mean for U.S. national security. Senator Mitt Romney lamented the loss of Bolton\u2019s \u201ccontrarian\u201d voice. At a time when the administration has been censoring contrarian views\u2014including factual ones\u2014telling the president what he needs to hear, and not just what he wants to hear, is an asset.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut painting Bolton as a heroic truth teller is missing the point. Bolton was a hugely ineffective national security adviser. He didn\u2019t occupy the role in any substantive way and failed to carry out the basic tasks that NSAs are expected to do\u2014including holding regular national security policy meetings and getting through to the president. While he was ignoring his job, he instead focused on building up his own ego, publicly airing his disagreements with the president and pursuing his own policy convictions.\n\nBolton might try to drum up sympathy on a media tour\u2014he has already contacted members of the media attempting to set the details of his White House departure straight\u2014but no one should shed a tear for him. He met his demise because he cared more about his ego than the job he signed up for. U.S. national security took a hit for it.\n\nBolton was national security advisor in name only. His predecessors have all used the role differently depending on their personal styles and the presidents whom they served. But successive NSAs have still agreed that certain core responsibilities come with the job, including running a dynamic, high level interagency process. This process\u2014in which the NSA solicits the views of relevant members of the national security team\u2014is used to provide recommendations to the president on national security issues.\n\nThis requires endless hours in the situation room engaging with other members of the national security council, from the secretary of state and secretary of defense to the secretary of the treasury and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. It also requires coordination with the intelligence community so that all members of the national security council, and the president, are operating from the same sheet of music.\n\nWhile running this process, the NSA serves as the president\u2019s senior most adviser on national security. He or she is successful when he or she knows the president\u2019s every move and advises him on whether to take it\u2014advice that is based on both his or her views and the views of the rest of the NSC.\n\nBolton dropped the ball on this important process. Early in his tenure, we learned that he had significantly scaled down critical national security council meetings, and the paucity of these \u201cPrincipals Committee\u201d meetings were worrying members of Trump\u2019s cabinet.\n\nEither because he wasn\u2019t faithfully executing his job and representing the interagency\u2019s views or because the president just didn\u2019t want to hear what he had to say, Bolton didn\u2019t earn the ear of the president. He was put to pasture in Mongolia when Trump met with Kim Jong Un at the DMZ and was not in a key meeting with a North Korean official in the Oval Office. More recently, reporting indicated that Bolton wasn\u2019t even originally invited to a key meeting on Afghanistan let alone running it.\n\nWhile Bolton wasn\u2019t performing the core functions of his job in private, he was making a name for himself in public. He publicly contradicted Trump on issues like the U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria and used different talking points on core national security issues like North Korea.\n\nTrump, too, spoke publicly about his differences with Bolton\u2014particularly on issues that they used to be eye to eye on like North Korea. But the difference between the two is that Bolton chose to serve this president. In doing so, his job while national security adviser was to publicly support the president\u2019s decisions, whether he agreed with them or not. Instead, Bolton distanced himself from the man he was supposed to be serving, and did little to signal that he was focused on much other than his preferred policy narrative.\n\nThere were even reports that the U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan reconciliation, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, didn\u2019t want to leave Bolton with a copy of the peace deal under negotiation with the Taliban out of fear that Bolton would leak the details to the press, especially if he disagreed with them. More recently, Bolton\u2019s disagreement with the president\u2019s decision to meet with the Taliban at Camp David made its way into the press .\n\nInternal divisions are nothing new on the national security council. President Barack Obama and members of his national security team didn\u2019t agree on every issue, nor did they hold back when it came to sharing those differences. But disagreements were aired in the situation room, or behind other closed doors. The operating principle was, and should be, that the team hashes out differences privately so that it can present a united front behind the president in public.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for this. When internal divisions become public, classified discussions play out in the court of public opinion. U.S. diplomacy can become confused, and national security decisions look like they don't have full of buy-in. Foreign counterparts know which members of the national security apparatus are more in line with their objectives and can try to play members off against each other. That\u2019s not in our national security interest\u2014what happens in the Situation Room should stay in the Situation Room.\n\nEven on Tuesday, on the day of his departure, Bolton was focused on establishing his personal narrative, publicly. Shortly after Trump claimed to have fired him, Bolton texted Fox News host Brian Kilmeade to assert that he had resigned and that he was not in fact fired. He\u2019s reportedly already departed the White House rather than working with the president to ensure a smooth transition to whomever will act in his place. Whether that was his choice or Trump\u2019s, it\u2019s something that any NSA should have insisted on because it\u2019s in the best national security interests of our country.\n\nBolton took the road less traveled when it comes to serving as a national security advisor. He didn\u2019t perform the core functions of his job nor did he understand how to voice differences of opinion, whether with the president or with other members of the national security council, in an appropriate or useful fashion. Instead, he remained on the sidelines except when it came to making sure that things he wanted us to know he said were a matter of public record. Let\u2019s hope that the next national security adviser does a lot better than Bolton.", "description": "The former national security adviser failed to live up to the most basic requirements of his position.", "authors": ["William J.
