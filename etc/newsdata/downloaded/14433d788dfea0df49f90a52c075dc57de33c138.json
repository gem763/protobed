Supplied\n\nWoolworths has had the run of the town since it opened its original store in 1982. Its only competition until more recently has been a small independent supermarket \u2013 an IGA \u2013 that operates at the other end of town. Aldi joined the mix in 2012 but Coles, which has supermarkets in Ballina and Ocean Shores, has not yet infiltrated the market.\n\nColes, which traditionally has had a larger presence in Victoria than in NSW, declined to comment on whether it was interested in Byron Bay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoolworths will soon be opening another store nearby, a 3300sq m supermarket at Lennox Head, as part of a $35 million shopping centre development to service the 500 new households within the Epiq housing estate.\n\nAnd in 2009, after strong community opposition, the hinterland community of Mullumbimby succumbed to Woolworths when it won approval from the state government to build a 3000sq m centre.\n\nA Woolworths spokeswoman said the Byron Bay Shire formed a key part of the significant investment it continues to make in northern NSW.\n\n\"We work hard to provide convenient shopping experiences for our Byron Bay customers with good prices on products they want and a great fresh food offer,\" she said.\n\nByron's evolution\n\nGiven the Byron Bay region's reinvention in the 1970s from an industrial area to a hippie nirvana that attracted surfers and environmentalists with its countercultural lifestyle, residents have had mixed success trying to keep a lid on large-scale businesses and franchises in favour of farmers markets and local health food stores.\n\nSince the 1990s the town has been thwarting attempts by McDonald's to establish itself in Byron. More recently, at the new Mercato development, there is a noticeable absence of fast-food outlets despite the likes of Hungry Jack's rumoured to have been looking to making a move to Byron.\n\n\"Despite some jarring elements Byron still has its [small] scale, sense of place and social vibrancy,\" the former long-term mayor of Byron Bay, Jan Barham, told The Australian Financial Review. \"It's changed but not at the rate and fear we had in the '80s and '90s.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"But when Baskin and Robbins [arrived] it was a big realisation for the community that council can't control commercial operations.\"\n\nSubway, Domino's and Sportsgirl franchises have since set up shop in the town.\n\n\"Council doesn't have control over commercial operators and who comes in, only the structures and that\u2019s been eroded by state approvals,\" she said.\n\nWith Byron's focus on farmers' markets, health food stores and independently owned ethical businesses, the idea of supermarket monopolies in town were at odds with the general Byron vibe, Ms Barham added.\n\nRegional manager at NSW business chamber, Jane Laverty, said she supported investment in regional areas that created entry-level jobs for young people, which was often the case with retail businesses.\n\n\"When you have competition among supermarket groups the consumer is the one that benefits, and it's already hard enough to live in regional areas to get that competitiveness in terms of cost of living,\" Ms Laverty said.\n\nShe said supermarkets also catered to less transient visitors who bought their groceries and were there for the longer term, which was of great benefit to the local community.", "description": "Byron's biggest shopping centre development opened up earlier this year and now a nearby site ripe for development has hit the market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5963%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6bf8050dd163e8b0ca4c9d8dffc13a124f483b2b", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
