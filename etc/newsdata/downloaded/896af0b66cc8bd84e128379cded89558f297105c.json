You\u2019ve gotta laugh, don\u2019t you?\n\nJenkins took to Twitter to share the side-by-side comparison, which shows the nauseating Trump logo superimposed onto his FXB cap, alongside the caption \u201cWoke up this morning to know I\u2019m the new face for the 2020 @realDonaldTrump campaign?\u201d\n\nWoke up this morning to know I\u2019m the new face for the 2020 @realDonaldTrump campaign ???????? ? pic.twitter.com/gl5SqPxKsj \u2014 Rykard ???????? (@ItsRykard) September 13, 2019\n\nThis is a rookie move by Trump\u2019s team for a number of reasons. Firstly, if you were going to nab someone\u2019s photo, surely you\u2019d choose someone who didn\u2019t have a high profile and the power to hang you out to dry.\n\nAlso, given that Trump\u2019s willing to spend billions on nuclear weapons, you\u2019d assume they\u2019d have a few pennies lying around to invest in a wee, simple photoshoot\u2026 But no, instead of simply paying for their own model, they had to resort to a photoshop job that looks like it was done by one of their interns on Microsoft Paint.\n\nOnce again, the Trump administration have proven how trustworthy they are.\n\nAfter receiving a few recommendations to find legal representation, Jenkins came up with his own solution:\n\nHaha! Tbh I\u2019ll be happy for a free week in Trump Tower ???????????? \u2014 Rykard ????????
