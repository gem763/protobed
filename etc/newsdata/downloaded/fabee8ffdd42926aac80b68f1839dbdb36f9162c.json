Don\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s never been head coach\n\nWhen it comes to the progress the Springboks have made, eighteen months ago \u2013 when Rassie Erasmus took his first press conference as what we understood to be the Boks\u2019 head coach in a borrowed jacket \u2013 seems a lifetime ago.\n\nBut according to an SA Rugby statement which followed a few weeks later, the head coach position was as temporary as the borrowed jacket as his real day job, the one most of us whinged about him getting a six-year contract for, the director of rugby post.\n\nThe broad strokes of the press release were that Erasmus would guide the Boks to the ongoing World Cup before handing over the reins to someone else.\n\nLooking at the strides the Boks have made under Erasmus, about the only person who would like Rassie to focus on his day job once he\u2019s done in Japan is Mrs Erasmus, who, one presumes, would like the lawn to be mowed by the man of the house once in a while, instead of reading about whatever local rugby team he\u2019s seconded himself to.\n\nConsequently, speculating about Erasmus\u2019 successor as head coach \u2013 what with his team looking to make itself comfortable in Japan at the hosts\u2019 expense in today\u2019s quarterfinal \u2013 may come across as premature.\n\nBut in keeping with what we were told last year, Erasmus should spend the remainder of the year looking for a man after his own heart to take over coaching the Springboks.\n\nOf the current Super Rugby coaches, two of the three that are incumbent \u2013 John Dobson (Stormers) and Sean Everitt (Sharks) \u2013 will be making their coaching debuts in the competition, while the Bulls\u2019 Pote Human, with respect, doesn\u2019t scream Bok coach.\n\nHaving recently parted ways with Swys de Bruin \u2013 who left Erasmus high and dry by leaving his consultancy at the Boks less than a month before the World Cup \u2013 will probably end up with another greenhorn in Ivan \u201cCash\u201d van Rooyen.\n\nThere is Johann van Graan, whose arrival at Munster to replace Erasmus hinted at his having been recommended by the older man, but he hasn\u2019t looked anywhere near to restoring the Irish team to its heady days as European champions.\n\nThis leaves us to look within the current coaching team. Matt Proudfoot is known to want to graduate to head coach after the World Cup, but he is unlikely to be Erasmus\u2019 man given that he is the only member of the Bok coaching team who wasn\u2019t handpicked.\n\nOne gets the impression that Mzwandile Stick, who has already been thrown in at the deep end, is being slowly developed, so the one person that comes under the spotlight is defence coach Jacques Nienaber.\n\nA friend of the Bok coach from their army conscription days, the physiotherapist-cum-defence guru is Erasmus\u2019 most trusted lieutenant \u2013 and few people are more loyal to rugby relationships than Erasmus (ask Stick) \u2013 and has already been doubling up as the head coach\u2019s eyes and ears on the pitch as well as the first respondent physio on the field.\n\nThe pros of the decision would be the continuity of Erasmus\u2019 philosophy, that as director of rugby he\u2019d have the alignment he obsesses over, and that most defence coaches have historically made good head coaches.\n\nBut the elephant roaming the room is that Nienaber has never been head coach before. The problem is that in South Africa there are numerous precedents, the most recent being Van Rooyen\u2019s promotion from Lions conditioning coach to head coach in last year\u2019s Currie Cup.\n\nLong story short, Erasmus \u2013 who may yet be tempted by coaching the Boks against the British and Irish Lions in 2021 \u2013 has to sell the call. His track record and a satisfactory World Cup would grant him that consensus, so don\u2019t be shocked if Nienaber is the new Bok coach.", "description": "When it comes to the progress the Springboks have made, eighteen months ago \u2013 when Rassie Erasmus took his first press conference as what we understood to be the Boks\u2019 head coach in a borrowed jacket \u2013 seems a lifetime ago.", "authors": ["Simnikiwe Xabanisa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8113/9ac522c19def49948511a089bd776b19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
