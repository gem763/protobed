After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nColeen continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\nRebekah has denied the allegations (Picture: Jean Catuffe/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.

I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nThe reality star continued: \u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe concluded her post with a broken heart emoji.\n\nRebekah is currently pregnant with her fifth child, her second with footballer Jamie Vardy.\n\nThe WAG achieved further fame in 2017 when she appeared on I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here!\n\nShe and Coleen became pals as their husband played alongside each other for England.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
