FOREX-Dollar stands tall as investors seek shelter\n\n* Dollar finds support in quiet trade\n\n* Kiwi sharply sold as business confidence sags\n\n* Australian dollar drifts lower ahead of anticipated rate\n\n* European, U.S. data eyed\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Tom Westbrook\n\nSINGAPORE, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The dollar found broad\n\nsupport on Monday as global political uncertainty and fears over\n\na widening of the Sino-U.S trade war kept investors in safe\n\nharbours ahead of a slew of global economic indicators this\n\nweek.\n\nThe greenback was steady against most major currencies. It\n\nheld firm on the Japanese yen at 108.93 per dollar and\n\nsterling at $1.2287, while easing very slightly against the euro\n\nto $1.0932.\n\nIt gained against riskier, trade-exposed currencies such as\n\nthe Australian dollar and the Chinese yuan. The biggest loser\n\nwas the New Zealand dollar, which fell half a percentage point\n\nas business confidence hit its weakest in more than 11 years.\n\n\"Risk-off sentiment is prevailing in the market,\" said\n\nAnthony Doyle, global cross-asset specialist at fund manager\n\nFidelity International in Sydney, citing U.S. political turmoil\n\nand Brexit as looming worries, besides the trade war.\n\n\"There's a lot of uncertainty out there,\" he said.\n\nIn Asian hours, traders mostly shrugged off news that the\n\nTrump administration was considering de-listing Chinese\n\ncompanies from U.S. stock markets after the reports were hosed\n\ndown by Treasury officials. Elsewhere, factory activity surveys in China suggested there\n\nwere some signs of improvement this month, though analysts\n\nbelieve the gains cannot be sustained and forecast further\n\neconomic weakness. In Australia, forecasts for a rate cut on Tuesday firmed\n\nwith gathering economic gloom. Markets are pricing a better than\n\n75% chance the Reserve Bank of Australia will reduce its cash\n\nrate for a third time this year. RBAWATCH\n\nGerman inflation, British economic growth and U.S.\n\nmanufacturing indicators are all due later on Monday, with U.S.\n\nemployment figures at the end of the week. Anything short of\n\nexpectations poses a risk to fragile sentiment.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies the dollar edged\n\nhigher to 99.165.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 dropped as far as $0.6257,\n\nvery close to a four-year low, as a survey showed sour business\n\nsentiment and made a case for a rate cut. The Australian dollar AUD=D3 also drifted lower to $0.6756\n\non expectations of monetary easing.\n\nWith markets largely baking in another rate cut, further\n\nmoves in the Aussie will likely be driven by the RBA's tone and\n\noutlook, said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage\n\nPepperstone Group in Melbourne.\n\nTraders are expecting a lull in trade-war headlines as China\n\ntakes a week-long holiday from Tuesday, which marks the 70th\n\nanniversary of the People's Republic of China.\n\nChina's yuan held steady at 7.1219 per dollar.", "description": "FOREX-Dollar stands tall as investors seek shelter", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1P1M1_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
