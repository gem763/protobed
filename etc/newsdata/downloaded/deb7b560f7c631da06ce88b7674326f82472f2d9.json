This twist on the classic uses the last of the summer tomatoes, reducing their pur\u00e9e into a thick, concentrated gravy. A few added spices make for a tangy sauce in which to poach sea bass or other fish fillets. Be careful to cook the fish just until slightly firm and flaky to ensure it stays tender. Serve it as an appetizer, as Libyans do, or as a main course. A simple bulgur pilaf makes a nice accompaniment.\n\nFeatured in: For Libyan Jews, This Spicy Fish Stew Is The Taste Of Rosh Hashana.", "description": "Traditionally this Libyan Jewish dish is made with tomato paste, water and fish steaks, and served on holidays like Rosh Hashana This twist on the classic uses the last of the summer tomatoes, reducing their pur\u00e9e into a thick, concentrated gravy A few added spices make for a tangy sauce in which to poach sea bass or other fish fillets", "authors": ["Joan Nathan", "Erin Jeanne Mcdowell", "Barbara Kafka", "Melissa Clark", "Colu Henry", "Jerrelle Guy", "Samin Nosrat", "Julia Moskin", "Ali Slagle", "Sam Sifton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/16Roshrex/merlin_160015893_b3822410-838a-4573-b62c-4848c684d5e8-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
