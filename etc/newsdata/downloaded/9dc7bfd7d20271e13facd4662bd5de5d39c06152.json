Randall Flagg, who is sometimes referred to simply as the Dark Man, is described as someone \"with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers.\" He has the ability to appear in the dreams of plague survivors -- with a rather sinister motive in mind.\n\nOther cast members include Whoopi Goldberg as Mother Abagail, the frail 108-year-old woman who must save the world.\n\nJames Marsden, Amber Heard, Odessa Young, Jovan Adepo, Owen Teague, Henry Zaga and Brad William Henke also star.\n\nProduction began Friday in Vancouver. Josh Boone and Ben Cavell will write and executive produce and Boone will also direct. King will write the last chapter of the series, which will end with a coda that's different from the one in the book.\n\nRead More", "description": "Alexander Skarsgard will play Randall Flagg -- aka The Dark Man -- in \"The Stand,\" CBS All Access' limited series based on the Stephen King novel.", "authors": ["Whitney Friedlander"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190913091239-alexander-skarsgard-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
