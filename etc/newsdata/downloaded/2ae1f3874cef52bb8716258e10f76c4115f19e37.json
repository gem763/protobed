USA TODAY\n\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Aaron Boone is lying completely sprawled out in the hallway outside the New York Yankees clubhouse late Monday evening at Target Field.\n\nInside the clubhouse, the Yankees celebrated their American League Division Series sweep over the Minnesota Twins, spraying champagne and beer, but it was as if someone called the cops and shut the party down for violating a noise ordinance.\n\nThe party lasted for no more than 30 minutes until the ripping sound of plastic protecting the lockers came off the wall, and just like that, they looked barely more excited than if they just swept the Baltimore Orioles in July.\n\nThe Yankees entered this series four days ago with the task of shutting down baseball\u2019s greatest power-hitting team, conquered, and swiftly dismantled the Twins by a combined score of 23-7 as if they just stole a car, stripped it down, and sold it for parts.\n\nNow, after winning their 106th game of the season, comes the real challenge: Winning the next round and advancing to their first World Series in a decade.\n\nFor the Yankees, the drought feels like it has lasted forever.\n\nNow, they\u2019re poised to make their own history.\n\nNATIONALS: 'Old guys' send series back to Los Angeles\n\nNLDS: Dodgers bound for another postseason disappointment?\n\nThey don\u2019t have anything resembling the 1-2 punch of Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole of the Houston Astros. Yet, they\u2019ve got one of their most complete teams since the turn of this century, able to beat you with power ball, small ball, defense, pitching and a clubhouse culture that has the biggest heart in the land.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\u2019 Yankees All-Star infielder DJ LeMahieu says quietly in the corner of the clubhouse, surveying the scene alone. \u201cEarly on, I felt it one of going to be one of those years. No matter who it is, they\u2019re going to get the job done, and that\u2019s a special feeling.\n\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s a lot of deep talented players here, but it\u2019s so selfless. Everyone checks their ego at the door. And roots for everyone.\n\n\u201cWe not only have the talent, but that chemistry, and that can sure can take you a long way in this game.\u2019\u2019\n\nYankees players celebrate on the field after sweeping the Twins in the ALDS. (Photo: David Berding, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nYankees slugger Aaron Judge says he has never seen anything like it, and when he spoke to the team after the game, hoisting his beer, he made sure to give the game hero\u2019s championship wrestling belt to 22-year-old Gleyber Torres, the youngest star of them all.\n\n\u201cI never been in an organization like this before where you\u2019re surrounded by so many All-Stars, superstars, MVPs and Cy Young winners,\u2019\u2019 Judge says, \u201cand they check their ego at the door. When we come in here, we all fight for one thing, and that\u2019s to win the ballgame today.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got an environment like that, there\u2019s no better place to play and thrive.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Yankees have reached the postseason 18 times, winning six pennants and four World Series championships since Brian Cashman became the GM in 1998, and yet, this group may be the most unique of them all.\n\nThey had a record 30 players on the disabled list this season. Their regular lineup didn\u2019t play their first game together the entire season until Game 1 of the ALDS. Giancarlo Stanton, their $325 million player, played 18 games all season. Their ace, Luis Severino, pitched only 12 innings until Monday night\u2019s clinching game. Their prime setup man, Dellin Betances, pitched two-thirds of an inning before his season ended.\n\nTheir leading winner, Domingo German (18-4), was suspended the rest of the season for violating MLB\u2019s domestic violence policy.\n\nSo it was only fitting Monday night that reliever Zack Britton walked off the mound in the eighth inning with a tender Achilles tendon, closer Aroldis Chapman\u2019s left hand was wrapped in ice when he fist-bumped Cashman, and veteran starter CC Sabathia pronounced himself ready for the ALCS after missing the division series with a strained shoulder.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a baseball team, it\u2019s a cavalry in spikes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got a lot of resiliency, a lot of heart, and a lot of talent,\u2019\u2019 Cashman says, \u201cbut in terms of what\u2019s going to make it unique, it\u2019s got to climb the final two mountains to compare it to our other teams.\n\n\u201cObviously, a storyline will be written. We want it to be a positive one. So we\u2019ll wait and see.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Yankees were cautious not to divulge who they prefer to play in the ALCS between the Astros and Rays, but let\u2019s be serious, there will be no bigger Tampa fans on Tuesday night.\n\nIf the Rays win, they force a Game 5, meaning that Cole would be unavailable until Game 3 in the ALCS.\n\nAnd if the Rays win that game, they may never have to see Cole again in the postseason if he switches leagues as a free agent.\n\nBesides, if the Rays win the series, the Yankees suddenly will have home-field advantage and will be playing a team they defeated 12 times during the season.\n\nWho do you think they\u2019d rather play?\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter either way,\u2019\u2019 LeMahieu says. \u201cThey\u2019re both really good teams. I just know that if we just keep playing like we did all year, and this series, we\u2019re going to be just fine.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd, well, a little scary.\n\nThis is a pitching staff that suffocated the Twins\u2019 high-powered offense. The Twins scored just seven runs, and produced only a solo homer the last 21 innings. The Yankees yielded a meager .218 batting average and 2.33 ERA, striking out 35 batters in 27 innings.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people had question marks about our pitching coming in,\u2019\u2019 Judge says, \u201cbut we have a lot of guys that put everything on the line every time they step on that rubber. When you\u2019re going against a team that hit the most home runs during the season, and shut them down to seven runs, that\u2019s impressive.\n\nThey put on a highlight show with their defense, with dazzling plays made by Judge, shortstop Didi Gregorius and Torres.\n\nAnd, of course, there was the star of the show, Torres.\n\nIf there was an MVP award in the Division Series, it would have gone to Torres, 22, who hit .417 in the series with a .462 on-base percentage, .917 slugging and an 1.378 OPS. He became the youngest Yankee to homer in the postseason since Derek Jeter in 1996, and only the second player under the age of 23 in major league history to produce three extra-base hits in a postseason game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be telling stories about that kid for quite awhile now,\u2019\u2019 Judge says. \u201cHe comes to work every single day, and always has a smile on his face. He\u2019ll come to the box with the bases loaded, and give us a little smile, like, 'I got this.\u2019 He\u2019s just a special individual.\u2019\u2019\n\nSays Cashman: \u201cYou see the personality coming out while he\u2019s consistently having success. It\u2019s a talent very few people possess.\u2019\u2019\n\nNow, with everyone still playing, and the Yankees having four days off, they can sit back, relax, and be even more dangerous in the ALCS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see these guys ball out,\u2019\u2019 Stanton says, \u201cbut we all know we got more work to do.\n\n\"We\u2019re the Yankees. It\u2019s our time of year.\u2019\u2019", "description": "After making mincemeat of the 101-win Minnesota Twins, the Yankees must wait to see who they'll meet in the American League Championship Series.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
