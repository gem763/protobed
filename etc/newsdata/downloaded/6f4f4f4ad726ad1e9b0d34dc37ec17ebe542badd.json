It is not right.\n\n\u201cI say to myself, whenever that happens, you have got to stick together as a team \u2013 which is what the boys did in Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cI was really proud of them and in those situations, where they say they would walk off the pitch, it\u2019s right (to make a stand) because no player should be treated differently.\n\n\u201cWe are all equal, it is an equal game, so we all have to stay strong. Stay the same, and the boys dealt with it well.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHopefully everything will be sorted properly by UEFA \u2013 everything that happened was obviously not right, but we have to stick together as a team and move on from it.\n\n\u201cGareth is the manager, he makes the decisions and we always have to stand by him.\n\n\u201cAs players, we speak to the manager and captain to ask them what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong.\n\n\u201cIf the manager says we stay on the pitch, we stay there, try to cope with it and we make the decision all as a team.\n\n\u201cIf we think it is right, and we can focus and carry on playing, then we do that. If not, and the manager says something different, then we do what the manager says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all up to the manager and the captain, but it\u2019s also a team decision, so we have a say in what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n(Image: Michael Zemanek/BPI/REX)\n\nHudson-Odoi performed with impressive verve for the Under-21s as they maintained their 100 per cent record in qualifying for the Euro 2021 championship in Hungary and Slovenia.\n\nAnd he can feel the confidence returning to his game, adding: \u201cMy dribbling and everything will come back to what it was.\n\n\u201cNow I am feeling a bit more confident to get on the ball and do my stuff. As the games go on I will get fitter, get more opportunities to run at people and I already feel better now.\u201d", "description": "The Chelsea star was not involved in England's 6-0 win over Bulgaria which was overshadowed by the racist behaviour of supporters", "authors": ["Mike Walters", "Image", "Getty Images", "Michael Zemanek Bpi Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14241115.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Callum-Hudson-Odoi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
