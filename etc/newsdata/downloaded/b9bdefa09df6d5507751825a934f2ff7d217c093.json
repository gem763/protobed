Has she taken down another victim?\n\nOnly time will tell\u2026\n\nJodie wore a high-vis jacket (Picture: Splash News)\n\nThe scenes were shot at night in London (Picture: Splash News)\n\nThe last chapter of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s trail-blazer closed with an infatuated Villanelle pulling the trigger on her prey, Eve, who was presumed dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of fans were skeptical that Eve has been killed off, but it looks as though she\u2019s alive and kicking as Sandra was spotted on set back in August.\n\nHow did she get that bruise?
