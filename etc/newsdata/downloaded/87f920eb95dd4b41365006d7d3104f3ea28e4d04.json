There was no chance in Westeros that Peter Dinklage (also known as Tyrion Lannister) was going to win an Emmy for the final season of Game of Thrones and not find a way to ruffle a few feathers. That's practically obligatory for a Lannister.\n\nBut when the actor was giving his acceptance speech for his fourth Emmy win, he took it to the next level with a quote that made Fox have to hit that bleep button on the back end. While addressing the audience, the actor said, \"Ten years of absolute sweat, but ten years of the most talented, motherfucking people,\" before trailing off at the audience's reaction and Fox's censorship. He quickly rebounded though, noting, \"Hey, it's over. I don't care.\"\n\nRead the full speech below:\n\n\"Thank you. I have no idea what I'm about to say, but here we go. I count myself so fortunate to be a member of a community that is all about tolerance and diversity, because no other place could I be standing on a stage like this. It's been about 10 years, all said and done, since the moment I met Dave and Dan until right now. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but I knew that David and Dan were quite brilliant. Ten years of absolute sweat, but 10 years of the most incredible, talented, funniest motherfucking people \u2014 hey, it's over, I don't care \u2014 I've ever been lucky enough to work with. We did nothing but sweat, we did nothing but laugh. Dave and Dan, we literally walked through fire and ice for you. Literally. And I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. Thank you.\"\n\nThe award came after three previous trophies and four nominations, making Dinklage Game of Thrones' most reliable power hitter. With the show coming to an end after eight seasons, this will be the last time that Dinklage will be nominated for the role of Tyrion, but considering that he had another nomination for his role in My Dinner with Herv\u00e9, it's safe to say that Dinklage is going to appear on his fair share of television screens moving forward.\n\nDinklage was the only Game of Thrones cast member to nab a major acting trophy for the final season (Drogon probably has a few fiery words to say about that). Here's to Tyrion\u2014long may he reign as the foul-mouthed icon we know him to be.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "You don't get out of Westeros without a few four, or twelve, letter missteps.", "authors": ["Justin Kirkland"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Sn_Vb3pTae8Jz3LVV6tzMQ--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/esquire_269/dc9e5b3fba398ceeb5dcb95e83bcb1cf", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
