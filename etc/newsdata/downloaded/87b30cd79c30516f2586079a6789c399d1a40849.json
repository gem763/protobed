The news was announced via his personal Instagram, where thousands reacted to the news.\n\nLindbergh, who was born in Germany, was one of the greats. He shot Anna Wintour\u2019s first Vogue magazine cover in 1988. Two years later, he ushered in the era of the \u201990s supermodel, when he photographed Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Tatjana Patitz, Christy Turlington, and Linda Evangelista for the cover of British Vogue. He wanted to \u201cbroaden\u201d the idea of beauty, he told editor Liz Tilberis at the time, which is why he cast so many different women. He also photographed campaigns for Calvin Klein and David Yurman, and his work has been shown in museums and galleries around the world, from Gagosian Paris to the Met.\n\nLindbergh was known for photographing his subjects in black-and-white, capturing them in as natural a state as possible. He began his career photographing models in plain white T-shirts, for example, and was also the first photographer to shoot Pirelli calendar subjects without makeup. \u201cRefusing to bow to glossy perfection is Peter Lindbergh\u2019s trademark,\u201d wrote Suzy Menkes.\n\nLindbergh was working up until very recently. He shot the September issue cover of British Vogue, for example, at the direction of guest editor, Duchess Meghan Markle.\n\n\u201cHis ability to see real beauty in people, and the world, was ceaseless, and will live on through the images he created,\u201d wrote the magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, on Wednesday.\n\nThe photographer is survived by his wife, Petra; his first wife, Astrid; his four sons, Benjamin, J\u00e9r\u00e9my, Simon, and Joseph; and seven grandchildren.", "description": "On Tuesday, September 3, the renowned fashion photographer, Peter Lindbergh died at the age of 74.
