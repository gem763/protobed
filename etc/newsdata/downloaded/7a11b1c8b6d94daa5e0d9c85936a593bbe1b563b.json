Institutional investors in Norway are among those leading divestments in the oil and gas sector. In June, the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund\u2014whose investments in Canada totalled US$28 billion at the time\u2014sold off investments in companies that do oil and gas exploration unless they had renewable-energy operations to help counteract their emissions.
