He recently announced he is battling stage IA breast cancer in an interview with \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor Michael Strahan. In this first-person account, Knowles shares his story on coming to terms with his diagnosis, thoughts on the stigmas attached to male breast cancer and his hopes that his account will inspire more men to speak out.\n\nI noticed because I wear white T-shirts. I had a dot of blood on my T-shirt.\n\nThe first day I was like \"Oh, OK, no big deal ... maybe it\u2019s something that just got on my T-shirt.\" Second day I looked and the same thing and I was like, \"Eh ... interesting.\"\n\nThen on the third day I was like, \"What is this? I wonder what this is.\"\n\nA couple of days passed, and I didn\u2019t have any type of discharge. Then on the fifth day, another, just a tiny drop of blood. I told my wife, I said, \"Look at this,\" And she says, \"You know, when I cleaned the sheets the other day I saw a drop of blood on it, and I didn\u2019t pay any attention to it -- but this is kind of weird.\" I immediately went to my doctor.\n\nWhen I had the blood on my T-shirt initially I didn\u2019t think it was breast cancer. My mind went a lot of places. My mind went to what medication I was on, because different medications might have caused some sort of discharge ... and then I thought, just because of the risk factor, that it could be breast cancer and I would go get a mammogram.\n\nFor context, in 1980 I worked in the medical division of Xerox. I worked there for eight years, selling Xeroradiography, which was at that point the leading modality for breast cancer.\n\n\u201c \u201d Talk about it. Speak up. Speak out. Sooner, faster, quicker about it. That\u2019s what strength is. Weakness is when you want to keep it secret.\n\nBy being in that position, I had to learn, because I sold to radiologists, all of the modality technology terminology. Then I worked with Philips, selling MRI/CT scanners. I just want to give some context to why it got my attention, more so than others.\n\nI knew this: Back then, it was 1 in 10 women would get breast cancer, now it\u2019s 1 in 8 because we have more research and more data.\n\nAlso, my mother\u2019s sister died of breast cancer, my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s two and only daughters died of breast cancer and my sister-in-law died in March of breast cancer with three kids \u2013 a 9-, 11- and a 15-year-old -- and my mother-in-law had breast cancer. So breast cancer has been all around me. My wife's mother has breast cancer, too.\n\n\"That is a very common thing to hear from male patients,\" Dr. John Kiluk, a surgical oncologist who specializes in breast cancer in The Center for Women's Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center, told \"Good Morning America.\" \"When it comes to breast cancer we really don\u2019t know what causes it. We are trying hard to find what causes cancer. ... I think the one thing though that we do know is that there\u2019s a strong genetic tie with cancer.\"\n\n\"Female breast cancer is very common -- it happens in 1 in 8 women,\" Kiluk continued. \"Male breast cancer is rare -- we have about 2,000 to 3,000 cases a year in the United States. ... I think anyone who presents with any kind of strong family history really do warrant to consider doing genetic testing to figure out if there is a tie that we can explain what\u2019s going on here.\"\n\nFast forward, I go to my doctor, and I say I\u2019d like to get a mammogram. He suggested I get a mammogram, but first he said, \"Let\u2019s get a smear.\"\n\nSo they got a smear of the blood, and it was nonconclusive. Then we got a mammogram and that\u2019s when we saw that, in fact, there was breast cancer there. At least they thought. The next step is to get an ultrasound and a needle biopsy. That\u2019s when they determined it for sure -- I had breast cancer.\n\nThe first calls I made were to my kids, and my former wife, Tina. My wife, Gena, already knew; she went with me to the exam.\n\nIt was July and I had surgery immediately, and that\u2019s when we got back the BRCA results, a genetic test used to determine a person's chance of developing breast cancer.\n\nI also met with Dr. Susan Domchek, director of the MacDonald Women\u2019s Cancer Risk Evaluation Center and executive director of the Basser Center for BRCA at the University of Pennsylvania, and she shared with me this whole BRCA information that I had never heard: all men and women have a BRCA gene. The results from my BRCA test were that I had a mutation on my BRCA2.\n\n\"The importance of gene testing is several fold,\" Kiluk said. \"One is that if we do find the gene that you can give estimates on what is the probability in finding cancer in that person\u2019s lifetime. With that information you can help guide treatments and surveillance to hopefully prevent any future issues and be very proactive. Even if the genes are negative, you still have to be very careful because who\u2019s to say there is something we just haven\u2019t discovered yet.\"\n\n\"But that being said, if we do have a gene, it really helps with counseling and screening and with the BRCA1 in particular there\u2019s a strong tie between breast cancer and ovarian cancer and so we can be very proactive in looking out for those kinds of cancers,\" he added. \"Usually the most common gene that we associate with male breast cancer is the BRCA2 gene and that\u2019s probably the most common gene I come across with our male patients. One in 400 people carry a BRCA gene.\"\n\n\u201c \u201d Men want to keep it hidden, a secret, we feel embarrassed \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason for that.\n\nNow what does having a mutation on BRCA2 mean for a man? You have a high risk -- 50 to 70% chance -- of getting breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer or melanoma. For women, it\u2019s breast cancer and ovarian cancer.\n\nI\u2019m still getting test results back. I got an MRI for pancreatic cancer and my pancreas and liver are fine. My dermatologist removed 2 moles -- both of which came back benign for melanoma. I got an MRI on my prostate a week ago, but we\u2019re still waiting on the results.\n\nI am going to get the second breast removed in January, because I want to do anything I can to reduce the risk. We use the words \"cancer-free,\" but medically there\u2019s no such thing as \"cancer-free.\" There\u2019s always a risk. My risk of a recurrence of breast cancer is less than 5%, and the removal of the other breast reduces it down to about 2%.\n\nMy kids have a 50% to 70% chance of getting the BRCA mutation and breast cancer. That\u2019s male or female. We used to think this was only an issue for women, but this is male or female.\n\nOn using his voice to inform and inspire\n\nI want to continue the dialogue on awareness and early detection -- male or female. The key to this is early detection.\n\n\u201c \u201d I\u2019m not defined by my body.\n\nBreast cancer has been prevalent in our family. I want men and women to be aware -- if you detect the cancer early you can have a low mortality rate and live a normal life. If you find breast cancer, stage 1 or stage 2, you have a really good shot at a normal life.\n\nBut it\u2019s the importance of going and doing it. I get frustrated that people aren\u2019t going to get the procedure. For men and women, it\u2019s taking the time to get a BRCA test -- just a simple blood test. You can do it in addition to any other blood tests you\u2019re doing, or you can do it separately. It\u2019s $250, and it\u2019s covered by all insurance companies.\n\nThere\u2019s no excuse for it. We\u2019ll go get a new pair of shoes. Well, why not an important test you can go and get that could save your life? Equally important, your children's lives.\n\nRobert Galbraith/Reuters, FILE\n\nHis message for those battling male breast cancer\n\nFind a support team, and that team shouldn\u2019t discriminate if it\u2019s male or female. That would be number one. Talk about it. Speak up. Speak out. Sooner, faster, quicker about it. That\u2019s what strength is.\n\nWeakness is when you want to keep it secret.\n\nI need men to speak out if they\u2019ve had breast cancer. I need them to let people know they have the disease, so we can get correct numbers and better research. The occurrence in men is 1 in 1,000 only because we have no research.\n\nMen want to keep it hidden, because we feel embarrassed -- and there\u2019s no reason for that.\n\n\"Everyone understands female breast cancer and that we\u2019ve come so far with advances in breast cancer. \u2026 Women go in, get their mammograms and check themselves -- everyone is hyper-vigilant,\" Kiluk said. \"That\u2019s why we\u2019re having really good outcomes with females. Now on the other side, I\u2019d say that most people don\u2019t even realize that guys can get breast cancer. As patients, guys may push things off and say, 'Oh no, it\u2019s nothing; it\u2019s just a cyst or something like that.'\"\n\n\"Even doctors can ignore things and say, 'Oh you\u2019re a guy, don\u2019t worry about it,'\" he continued. \"As a result, things can progress along. We don\u2019t hear it that often with male patients that someone is a stage 1, they are usually further advanced because it\u2019s not diagnosed early. There\u2019s no recommendation for men to do mammograms for screening but that being said, I think it\u2019s important that everyone be aware that \u2018yes, I\u2019m a guy but I can still get cancer and I should check myself.\u2019 This goes for anything in the body; the patient is the best doctor. So much of cancer is early detection and giving awareness is the No. 1 piece to that puzzle.\"\n\nThe second thing is know your family history. This is not just for cancer, it\u2019s for all diseases -- especially in the black community. I want the black community to know that we\u2019re the first to die, and that\u2019s because we don\u2019t go to the doctor, we don\u2019t get the detection and we don\u2019t keep up with technologies and what the industry and the community is doing. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\n\nOn making room for men in the breast cancer conversation\n\nI feel gratitude that I caught it early. I have even more sense of understanding when a woman gets breast cancer and the psychological decision that it must be to have your breast removed.\n\n\u201c \u201d We\u2019ve got to change the process of getting an exam. Even from walking into a building that says \"female breast clinic.\" That\u2019s got to be rethought.\n\nNot all the things that I went through will be the same for a woman.\n\nHow would it look? How would my wife accept it? How will other people accept it? How will I feel about myself? All of those questions -- I came up with answers.\n\nI\u2019m not defined by my body. My wife kinda laughed and was like, \"So what? I love you.\" For a man, it\u2019s easier. You know, if I open my shirt you can\u2019t even tell. It\u2019s an easier thing for a man.\n\nBut I do sympathize now and have empathy for a female when they have to go through that decision-making process. I think the world has gotten different, technology is different, reconstruction is available. There\u2019s all sorts of things available today, because technology keeps changing.\n\nIn the '80s, it was xeroradiography, which is what I sold. In the '90s and 2000s, it was film. Then it became ultrasound, and now it\u2019s really MRI technology that\u2019s the gold standard for getting a mammogram. It\u2019s no longer film, especially with dense breasts.\n\nWe have work to do. I shared with the University of Pennsylvania that if we\u2019re going to try to emphasize breast cancer for both men and women we\u2019ve got to change the process of getting an exam. Even from walking into a building that says \"female breast clinic.\" That has to be rethought, to the point that the questions that were asked: \"When was the last time you had your cycle? Have you ever had a pregnancy?\" These have to change.\n\nI want to emphasize that because that\u2019s one of the things that keeps men from going. Just walking into a building, I know how I felt, walking into a room that said \"female breast center.\"\n\nIt\u2019s those things that have to change.", "description": "In this first-person account, Mathew Knowles shares his story on coming to terms with his diagnosis and his thoughts on the stigmas attached to male breast cancer.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/mathew-knowles-abc-ml-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
