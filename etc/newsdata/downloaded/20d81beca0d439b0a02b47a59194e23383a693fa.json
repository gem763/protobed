Biden had argued that he had to keep his focus on defeating Trump at the ballot box as the Democratic nominee next year.\n\nBut polling indicates a swift shift in the public\u2019s mind on the question of impeachment. Majorities now back Congress moving forward now that Trump has said in public that he had sought investigations in Ukraine and China against Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to take on Trump next year. Support for impeachment has risen eight points among Republicans since May and 11 points among independents, according to CNN\u2019s polling.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts. You know, to preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d Biden said at a campaign stop in Rochester, N.H.\n\nAs Biden was speaking, the President reacted on Twitter: \u201cSo pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment \u2013 and I did nothing wrong. Joe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\u201d\n\nSo pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nThe dual-track breaking developments suggested the President had set aside at least part of his 1 o\u2019clock hour to watch one of the Democratic frontrunners, who in poll after poll is seen as a strong challenger to the President\u2019s re-election. Trump not only faces a re-election challenge but a potential constitutional one from Congress.\n\n\u201cWe cannot let him get away with it,\u201d Biden said to loud applause during one of his stronger appearances of the year. \u201cWe all laughed when he said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. It\u2019s not a joke. He is shooting holes in our Constitution, and we cannot allow him to get away with it.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s updated stance puts him in the mainstream of the Democrats seeking their party\u2019s nomination, and in line with the voters who have a solid raft of other options. A full 81% of self-described liberals in the latest Washington Post poll said they thought Trump\u2019s asks were inappropriate and 68% of self-described moderates said the same. Perhaps most threatening to Trump? The 37% of self-described conservatives who thought Trump was inappropriate to have asked for foreign help. Even the fewest defections from the Trump alliance of 2016 is a danger for the re-election campaign, and Biden has made clear he plans to compete for any voter who will hear him out.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s disclosure that he had sought foreign help to ding his domestic political rival shifted the primary\u2019s discussion, from an exercise in resistance to one of political necessity inside a contest that may be the most progressive in a generation. The Post poll released this week shows 57% of independents and a remarkable 28% of Republicans think Congress should have begun an impeachment inquiry into Trump. Being for impeachment no longer was considered fringe.\n\n(The same dynamic is at play among Republicans, especially those facing voters this year, but in reverse. Sen. Martha McSally, appointed to fill the balance of the late John McCain\u2019s seat after losing a bid last year for a full six-year term, has been \u201cevolving,\u201d in the words of an Arizona Republic headline. The celebrated fighter pilot called impeachment a \u201ckamikaze mission\u201d in September but in recent days has repeatedly refused to answer local reporters\u2019 questions about her position, merely saying the process is serious. She faces a potentially rough bid next year in a border state where Trump is simultaneously beloved and reviled.)", "description": "Biden had argued that he had to keep his focus on defeating Trump at the ballot box", "authors": ["Philip Elliott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/L9GcbwrtBDy5OEaq8tKgZg--~B/aD02ODQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/08ebb44a34ad3bcf6ac41f05ab7e434e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
