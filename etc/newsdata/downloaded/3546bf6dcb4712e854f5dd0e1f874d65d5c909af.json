Well, except perhaps one team. (Sorry, Miami Dolphins fans.)\n\nBut it\u2019s always good to have the long game in mind. NFL teams are not just stuck in day-by-day and week-by-week mode, as there\u2019s always a team-building element that stretches out months and years into the future.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s see which teams could be the most heavily armed when the offseason comes (before you know it). The NFL draft historically has been the best way to build an infrastructure, and there are a handful of needy teams who appear to be stocking up for 2020 and beyond.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHere are the five teams \u2014 plus a wild card sixth team \u2014 that are loaded with 2020 NFL draft capital as things stand now:\n\nYes, there\u2019s a reason to be hopeful, even coming off a historic Week 1 home loss. The Dolphins currently own an incredible eight first- and second-round picks over the next two years and should be able to use that haul to land the future franchise quarterback of their choosing.\n\nSome have suggested that the Dolphins might be playing the extra long game here and actually waiting for 2021 to do so, with Clemson\u2019s true sophomore QB Trevor Lawrence being the type of prospect who is worth nuking two entire seasons for.\n\nMy gut feeling right now? I can\u2019t see that.\n\nDolphins fans might buy into a one-year punt, but floundering for two years? Out of the hopes that they can get Lawrence and immediately contend? It doesn\u2019t add up. They\u2019ll make the big push for a QB next year \u2014 with Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa and Oregon\u2019s Justin Herbert the targets as things stand.\n\nAlabama QB Tua Tagovailoa ... future Miami Dolphin? (Getty Images)\n\nStory continues\n\nHeck, the Dolphins might not even need to trade up for either one if they land one of the first two or three picks in the draft. But should they need to flex their draft-pick muscles, it shouldn\u2019t be hard. That is, unless the team(s) picking ahead of them also are looking to draft quarterbacks.\n\nThe worst-case scenario here would be selecting third overall (or lower) and have multiple teams also interested in drafting a QB. That\u2019s about the only way that the Dolphins won\u2019t get one of their preferred targets at the position. That\u2019s why you figure they have to do work on Plans C, D and E, which could be Georgia\u2019s Jake Fromm, Utah State\u2019s Jordan Love or \u2014 too soon? \u2014 LSU\u2019s Joe Burrow, who is off to a blistering start for the Tigers.\n\nThe Laremy Tunsil trade netted them first-rounders in 2020 and 2021, plus a second-rounder in 2021. They also have the Saints\u2019 second-rounder next year from a draft day trade in April and could end up netting extra third- and fifth-round compensatory picks (via Over The Cap) for losing Ja\u2019Wuan James and Cameron Wake in free agency.\n\nThat\u2019s a massive pile of assets. Will general manager Chris Grier and head coach Brian Flores use them wisely? The next seven months\u2019 worth of speculation will be fascinating.\n\nThe draft next April is in Las Vegas, and the (new) local team will be holding residency for three days. The Raiders\u2019 draft runway show will include additional first- and third-round picks from the Chicago Bears, via the Khalil Mack trade (although Chicago owns the Raiders\u2019 second- and fifth-round picks).\n\nThe team has used 18 draft picks the past two years (12 of them in Rounds 1-4) and appear to have built up its infrastructure.\n\nHeck, the Raiders\u2019 rookie 2019 class \u2014 they have 12 first-year players on the roster \u2014 had their fingerprints all over Monday\u2019s impressive victory over the Denver Broncos, playing a combined 314 snaps in that game. (Only the recently re-acquired Keelan Doss was inactive among Oakland\u2019s rookies vs. Denver.)\n\nJon Gruden, left, and Mike Mayock know that the future of the Oakland Raiders could depend on another big draft haul in 2020. (Getty Images)\n\nWill GM Mike Mayock and head coach Jon Gruden be more aggressive with that pick ammo? They took a very safe, high-floor approach to the No. 4 overall pick this spring with Clelin Ferrell and now have seen some high-end talent walk out the door in Amari Cooper, Antonio Brown and Mack. The Raiders could use a few true difference makers and might target one or two of them in the draft \u2014 or trade picks for a veteran.\n\nAnother factor: How good is this team?\n\nEither way, the Raiders might be compelled \u2014 especially coming to a new town \u2014 to go big in this coming draft as a way to sell tickets. The Raiders could end up with some real firepower based on how those two teams end up finishing in the standings. And if it\u2019s another disappointing Raiders season, the pressure will crank up on Gruden and Mayock to hit big in some way.\n\nThe absolute worst-case scenario would be the Raiders (despite the 1-0 start) sinking to the bottom of the league and the Bears (despite the 0-1 start) winning the Super Bowl. That would mean the Raiders would pick 32nd overall and the Bears 33rd, so the Mack trade would look even worse in retrospect, essentially dealing him for only one first-round pick, not two.\n\nEven with the Jadeveon Clowney trade, they\u2019re in nice shape next year. They sent away a third-round pick to Houston in that deal but will land an extra second-rounder from the Chiefs via the Frank Clark trade. (That second-round pick will be the less favorable of the Chiefs\u2019 two 2020 second-rounders, their own and the 49ers\u2019 two, so it could come at the end of Round 2 if the Chiefs are as good as expected.)\n\nStill, they also stand to add third-, fourth-, sixth- and seventh-round compensatory selections for letting Earl Thomas, Justin Coleman, Mike Davis and Shamar Stephen walk in free agency this year. The always-active Seahawks should be well-stocked in this coming draft, prepared to move up or down the board.\n\nThe trend under GM John Schneider and head coach Pete Carroll has been to slide down in the draft and later maneuver up or down in the middle rounds. This coming draft-pick till affords them that freedom again.\n\nProjecting their needs and potential targets is always a crapshoot. The Seahawks work off their own draft board, which often deviates from the collective league value of prospects, so it\u2019s a mystery to consider how they might approach this year.\n\nOur safest prediction: They\u2019ll be busy again.\n\nDon\u2019t look now, but the Ravens have built a nice little nest egg for 2020.\n\nThey own all of their picks next year in Rounds 1-5; have extra fourth- and fifth-round picks via the Patriots and Vikings, respectively; and Baltimore is slated to earn third- and fourth-round compensatory picks. The Ravens will be shipping out their own sixth-rounder to New England and a seventh to Green Bay, but they\u2019ve accumulated some nice assets here.\n\nThe Ravens have a bunch of 2020 free agents, although none terribly pressing to re-sign. Expect some roster overhaul and a bit of a youth movement, with Marshal Yanda a possible retirement candidate and Jimmy Smith a player they might be ready to move on from.\n\nWith Lamar Jackson on his rookie contract, count on the Baltimore Ravens to use their draft assets aggressively. (Getty Images)\n\nStill, bet on them being aggressive. That could include signing a few outside free agents and being ready to pounce up in the draft if the right opportunity to add a difference maker presents itself.\n\nThe Ravens are in that rookie-QB contract window with Lamar Jackson to load up at other positions, and Jackson is coming off a career-best performance in Week 1. It\u2019s a great spot to be in if you\u2019re GM Eric DeCosta, ready to load up for a Super Bowl run.\n\nYep, they\u2019re in great shape in the draft again next year \u2014 a tradition unlike any other.\n\nEven with fourth-, fifth- and multiple sixth-round picks going to other teams, the Patriots will get back a fourth-rounder from the Bears from the David Montgomery trade and stand to get two third-round compensatory picks for losing Trent Brown and Trey Flowers in free agency.\n\nThat could mean that New England will have five Day 1 and 2 selections next spring. So yes, the rich stay rich, even if the Patriots\u2019 dominant Week 1 performance and recent history suggest they\u2019ll be picking at the ends of rounds once again. That\u2019s never stopped them in the past from working the system better than most teams.\n\nTom Brady\u2019s future appears to be a year-to-year situation, and we don\u2019t know for certain that Jarrett Stidham is his clear-cut replacement. They\u2019ll also have decisions to make on Antonio Brown, Joe Thuney, Kyle Van Noy, Josh Gordon and Jamie Collins, so there are quite a few moving parts.\n\nBut if there ever is a team with plans upon contingency plans, it\u2019s the Patriots. Bill Belichick has whiffed on some Day 2 picks in recent years, no doubt. But few people in league history have found ways to solve problems and find answers than Belichick, and he once again should be in great positioning to do so.\n\nAnd a team that could crash this party \u2026\n\nThey\u2019re short a second-round pick in 2020, thanks to the Montez Sweat trade. It could be a tough blow for a team that landed at No. 31 in Frank Schwab\u2019s Week 1 power rankings. (Geez, Frank, at least they looked semi-decent for the first 20 minutes!)\n\nLosing that pick could sting if the Redskins struggle this season, giving the Indianapolis Colts a selection that might end up in the 30s. But if it means picking in the top 10 (or top five \u2026 or top two?), the Redskins should end up in good shape.\n\nThere's also the standoff with Trent Williams. The Redskins say they\u2019re not trading him now, but their minds could change quickly if some OL-desperate team comes to them with a significant offer. That theoretically could make their 2020 pick pool grow.\n\nAfter taking Dwayne Haskins in Round 1, the Redskins might pass on a QB in 2020 ... we think. (Getty Images)\n\nDrafting Dwayne Haskins in Round 1 this year likely means that the Redskins also will be in good shape to offer their first-round selection to a QB-needy team, although making that assumption after the Arizona Cardinals dumped Josh Rosen under similar circumstances is a dangerous proposition.\n\nAnd the by-product of finishing that low in the standings likely would cost head coach Jay Gruden his job, and it might even force team owner Daniel Snyder to reevaluate the structure of the front office despite his blind loyalty to Bruce Allen.\n\nThe ideal situation, should they lose this season, would be to see enough development from Haskins in Year 1 to feel good about him and then peddle the first-round pick to the highest bidder. That could offset the missing second-round pick, and they also are expected to gain an additional fourth-rounder via compensatory pick.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Here are the five teams \u2014 plus a wildcard sixth team we added at the end \u2014 that are loaded with 2020 NFL draft capital as things stand now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TUofVfmRiCBGmqCQJF1zdg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MjkuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/stk0boefuf0C2wY0Cp2o_Q--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjQ4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7efd8860-d3ef-11e9-a7d7-fe8113bab143", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
