Deloitte declined to comment.\n\nThe ATO said it could not comment on the affairs of specific taxpayers due to confidentiality, and also in this case because the matter was before court.\n\n\u201cThe ATO administers the taxation and superannuation laws fairly, and taxation laws require the Commissioner of Taxation to administer taxation laws independently,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe ATO operates under the common law principle of natural justice, to act fairly and without perceived or actual bias.\u201d\n\nThose dissatisfied with their assessment can object and seek external review, either via an appeals tribunal or the Federal Court, it added.\n\nHuang emerged as one of Australia\u2019s biggest political donors soon after he began living in Australia, giving to both the country\u2019s main political parties. He rose to prominence after an influential opposition lawmaker was forced to resign in 2017, following allegations that he was linked to Chinese-aligned interests.", "description": "A prominent Chinese businessman and Australian political donor has dismissed an investigation by Australia's tax authorities into his assets as politically motivated.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
