Each baby is weighing approximately 2kgs and both the babies are healthy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she will have any major health issues in the post-delivery period.\n\nIn addition to Ms Mangayamma\u2019s unclear exact age, there are similar mixed reports about her husband\u2019s age. The BBC says he is 82, the BBC Telugu service does not give him an age, and the Hindustan Times and SWNS reports he is 80-years old.\n\nAccording to a separate report by the BBC, Mr Rajarao suffered a stroke on Friday \u2013 the day after the twins were born \u2013 and is now being treated in hospital.\n\nThe oldest confirmed mother was Mar\u00eda del Carmen Bousada from Spain, who gave birth to a child when she was 66 using IVF treatment. She died of ovarian cancer two years later.\n\nIn 2016, an Indian woman from Punjab who \u201cbelieved she was 70\u201d, gave birth to her first child after receiving two years of IVF treatment.", "description": "A woman aged 73 has reportedly given birth to twin girls in eastern India.
