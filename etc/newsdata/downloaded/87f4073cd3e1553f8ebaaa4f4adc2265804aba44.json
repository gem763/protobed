Because federal funding cannot be used for such research, the center needs private support.\n\nThe center\u2019s research will focus on applications of the drugs for treating opioid addiction, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders and depression, among other diseases.\n\n\u201cPsychedelics are a fascinating class of compounds,\u201d said Roland Griffiths, the center\u2019s director and a professor of behavioral biology in the Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cThey produce unique and profound change in consciousness,\u201d he said. \u201cThe center will allow us to expand on research to develop new treatments for a wide variety of psychiatric disorders. And it will allow us to extend on past research in healthy people to improve their sense of well being.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohns Hopkins is deeply committed to exploring innovative treatments for our patients,\u201d Paul B. Rothman, chief executive of Johns Hopkins Medicine and dean of the medical school\u2019s faculty, said in a statement. \u201cOur scientists have shown that psychedelics have real potential as medicine, and this new center will help us explore that potential.\u201d\n\nPsilocybin and MDMA are illegal drugs in the United States classified by the federal government along with heroin and cocaine. Laws relating to salvia vary by state, but it\u2019s illegal in most states.\n\nBut researchers at Hopkins and elsewhere have said such drugs could help in areas of pain, addiction and brain disorders.\n\nThe center is being funded by the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation and philanthropists who include Tim Ferriss, an author and technology investor; Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress; Blake Mycoskie, founder of the shoe company TOMS; and Craig Nerenberg, an investor.\n\nFerriss said his interest in the drugs is personal. There is depression and brain disease among family members, and a good friend died of a drug overdose. He said his contribution, between $2 million and $3 million, is the largest investment he has made in a corporate or nonprofit endeavor.\n\nHe said he was hoping to \u201caffect the timeline\u201d of federal regulatory approvals for psychedelic drugs, though he opposed over-the-counter uses.\n\n\u201cGood science takes time,\u201d he said, adding that he wanted to support \u201cunlocking the full potential of productive teams.\u201d\n\nThe center will look at how psychedelics affect behavior, brain function, learning and memory, the brain\u2019s biology and mood.\n\nThe Hopkins researchers said they understood the risks and dangers of using psychedelic drugs that they said were not addictive but could be abused. They said they could control for potential abuse or bad outcomes, such as long-term effects of the drug\u2019s use on those with undiagnosed mental health disorders, in a laboratory setting where people and drugs are carefully screened.\n\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse says there are many potential short- and long-term harms from hallucinogens. Users can see, hear and feel things that don\u2019t exist, experiences that can be unpleasant, known as a \u201cbad trip.\u201d\n\nUsers can suffer increased heart rate and blood pressure, nausea, intensified feelings, loss of appetite, sleep problems, excessive sweating and panic, though others may have intense spiritual experiences and feelings of relaxation. Users also can be a danger if they drive.\n\nOver time, according to the drug abuse institute, users can suffer persistent psychosis, visual disturbances, disorganized thinking, paranoia and mood changes, among other problems.\n\nThe institute said people can overdose on some hallucinogens, such as PCP, though serious medical emergencies are not common and not associated with drugs typically used in the research studies. Drugs also can be contaminated, and those trying to use psilocybin could consume poisonous mushrooms that look like the ones containing the compound.\n\nThere are not currently any federally approved psychedelic drugs for medicinal purposes.\n\n\u201cThe field is chock full of lessons, and we take them seriously,\u201d said Matthew Johnson, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences in the medical school, who is the center\u2019s assistant director. But he said the potential benefits could be enormous.\n\nThe rate of fatal opioid overdoses will probably make use of psilocybin more acceptable to the public, after a \u201cwar on drugs\u201d in the 1970s and \u201980s stymied all research into psychedelic substances for decades, said Sara Lappan, a visiting instructor in the counseling program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s department of human studies.\n\nLappan is working on a study using psilocybin to treat addiction to cocaine, a drug that has been making a comeback among users after years of declines. The Alabama study is among a handful around the country testing psilocybin for a variety of treatments.\n\nThat study aims to give people \u201cthe ability to change\u201d because of how they view themselves. It\u2019s like giving them \u201c10 years of therapy smashed into six hours,\u201d she said.\n\nResearchers, she said, hope eventually to use their scientific data to change the legal status of the drug, though she said she knew of no researcher who wants recreational use of psilocybin. And she agreed that the studies have shown promise because the participants and the substances are carefully screened.\n\nAt Hopkins, the funding is expected to support five years of research and a team of six faculty neuroscientists, experimental psychologists and clinicians.", "description": "", "authors": ["Baltimore Sun", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
