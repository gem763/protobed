This might be a sad news to some but for others it means reviving your wardrobe and getting ready for new season trends.\n\nInstagram is currently filled with endless fall outfit ideas and layering opportunities. What might be surprising, however, is how many of these fashion favorites can be found on Amazon.\n\nMore and more bloggers and influencers are copping fashion forward pieces on the retailing giant, and we're so here for it. Here are the best Amazon fashion finds we discovered on Instagram this week.\n\nSan Diego blogger Jen kicks off this list in a simple yet classic outfit. She paired an $18 black high-waist denim skirt with a $10 grey bodysuit, both found on Amazon. She finishes off the look with a Halogen cream cardigan and black thigh-high boots from Goodnight Macaroon. Her Instagram interiordesignerella will have you coming back for more fall inspiration.\n\nSocial media marketing consultant and fashion blogger Shannon is pumpkin patch ready in this edgy ensemble posted to her Instagram Shannonwaterman. She pairs a leopard print skirt, which you can get for as little as $8.99 on Amazon, with a black long sleeve turtleneck, black bag and suede hat for the simple yet stylish look.\n\nIf walking through a field covered in falling leaves while holding a Starbucks doesn't say fall, then nothing will. Fashion lover Ana loves a good deal and where else to find the best deals than Amazon. This ultra soft and chunky pullover sweater was a great find on Amazon for less than $20. She completed the look with a brown patterned skirt, Sam Edelman nude boots and a newsboy hat from Target. Her social media Ana_Nava is a great place to find inspiration for affordable outfits.\n\nSweaters are a fall must and Britney is serving looks in this cute oversized knit sweater that starts at just $18.99 on Amazon. The wife and new mom matched her sweater with a pair of Topshop black ripped jeans, nude loafers, and a tori tote bag all tied in with accessories for this post on her LoverlyGrey Instagram. She completed the look with a pecan brown hat from Red Dress Boutique.\n\nStyle blogger Sarah Lindner rightly captioned this picture: 'Another great Amazon Find.' She found this snuggly nude turtleneck on Amazon for just $30, and the thick scarf was just $12. For this post on TheHouseOfSequins, Sarah also wore a pair of blue skinny jeans and carried a Vince Camuto grey leather tote. Accessories are always a good way to complement your clothes, and the blogger completed her look with some gold plated midi-rings also from Amazon.\n\nFashion blogger Danielle, who posts at Shopdandy, is dressed head to toe in Amazon finds here. She pairs a $20 v-neck tunic top with black SPANX leggings, a $13 blanket scarf and Steve Madden knee-high boots. A nude chain bag and gold aviator sunglasses complete the look.\n\nFallen leaves makes for a great backdrop. And Nina Lacher knows it. The Florida mom posed for this photo on LawofFashionBlog wearing a khaki oversized boyfriend sweater and $13 chunky beanie both from Amazon. The rest of her outfit consists of a pair of ripped blue jeans from American Eagle, nude Vince Camuto boots and a Louis Vuitton cross-body bag.\n\nDailyMail.com may earn commissions on sales from the links on this page.", "description": "Amazon may not typically be the place you head to for fashion.
