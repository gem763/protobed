The Democrats reportedly dug through 7,000 lawsuits from all 50 states to pinpoint Trump's vulnerabilities.\n\nAccording to Axios, the DNC also put together a comprehensive document of each time Trump said Mexico would pay to build a wall along the United States-Mexico border during the 2016 presidential campaign. The DNC is expected to drop relevant information with local reporters, groups and Democrats in key battleground states, an anonymous source familiar with the document said.\n\nOne of their other key tactics will be focusing on anecdotal stories in states like Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona, Colorado, Florida and Texas. They want to find residents who feel Trump's policies have negatively impacted them. Specifically, Democrats plan to focus on farmers and truckers and how tariffs have hurt them.\n\nDemocrats want to \"prosecute the case that he [Trump] is bad at his job and it is hurting people in real ways,\" DNC Chairman Tom Perez said during a meeting with Democratic strategists last week, a source in attendance told Axios. The goal is to \"make it about [Trump's] performance as president, not his bigotry or awfulness.\"\n\nThe DNC has also filed of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to obtain even more information on Trump as the 2020 election gets closer.", "description": ".09/08/2019 20:34:05PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/247/ef67a9f4-4c98-4138-aaca-4ce46efae64c.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
