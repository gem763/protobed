Made of wormwood, florence fenel and green anise, it has been dubbed the 'green fairy' or 'the devil in a bottle,' and is a must-have drink for many visitors to the city. It also contains thujone, a chemical with mind-bending properties.\n\nAn estimated 6,000 England fans are expected in the Czech capital for the Euro 2020 qualifier, which has resulted in a massive security operation on account of Prague's reputation as Europe's stag-do capital. The majority are expected to remain in the city over the weekend.\n\nEngland supporters travelling abroad caused trouble in Porto and and Guimaraes last summer\n\nAround 6,000 England fans are expected in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic\n\nThe official ticket allocation for England fans is 3,800 for the match in Prague's Eden Arena stadium.\n\nPavel Nova, who works at the Moskyt bar in Prague, told Sportsmail: 'Absinthe is very popular for all those who visit Prague. But we know what can happen to those who drink too much; it can send you crazy and out of control.\n\n'England fans will be welcome to try this famous drink but we will not allow them to drink more than three shots of it. After that, we will not serve them any more absinthe. And if they are already very drunk, we will not serve them at all.'\n\nAbsinthe is drunk by mixing it with water and sugar. One of its most famous devotees was Vincent van Gogh, who was addicted to the drink and cut off his ear while under its influence. It is also believed to have contributed to his suicide.\n\nSupporters will not be able to drink more than three shots of the lethal beverage on Friday\n\nEliska Reznik from Bar Ferdinanda said: 'There is already tight security for this match and we do not want to be responsible for causing any problems by allowing England fans to drink as much absinthe as they want. Prague is known for its absinthe but this weekend is not a good time for England fans to find out what it is capable of.\n\n'It is a very powerful drink that can get you drunk very quickly and make you do things that you won't remember. We are restricting its drinking for England fans for their own safety and for the safety of our beautiful city.'\n\nCzech police are deploying special anti-riot units, helicopters and officers on horseback, in addition to hundreds of other officers who will be on duty in what is one of the biggest ever security operations in the city for a sporting event.\n\nAround 11 British police officers are also in the city working with their Czech counterparts to help identify known troublemakers.\n\nA gigantic Czech police operation is preparing for the arrival of England fans in the city\n\nEarlier this week, England manager Gareth Southgate appealed to supporters of the team to be on their best behaviour. It was also reported that deputy chief constable Mark Roberts, the National Police Chiefs' Council's Football Policing Lead, had written to UEFA in an attempt to have the game moved - but European football's governing body rejected the request.\n\nThe Football Association has also launched a campaign called 'report that idiot' calling on England fans to police themselves and report troublemakers to the police and to them.\n\nWhile last year's World Cup in Russia passed off trouble free, violence has flared at other matches, particularly those that are within easy reach and cheap to travel to, such as today's match in Prague.\n\nThe 19,000-capacity Sinobo Stadium will host Friday night's Euro 2020 Group A qualifier\n\nEngland supporters clashed with Portuguese police in Porto and Guimaraes last summer at the Uefa Nations League and were stormed by officers armed with batons and shields.\n\nSouthgate pleaded: 'Sadly, we are going to a place where people travel anyway for nights out from our country. What we don't need to see is that behaviour that I am afraid happens on our own high streets.\n\n'It is not something that is just England supporters, it is a societal issue of people with alcohol who are unable to control themselves. We certainly don't want to be taking that abroad and that being a representation of our country.'", "description": "VIVEK CHAUDHARY IN PRAGUE: Sales of the alcoholic drink absinthe are being restricted for England fans in Prague over fears that it might cause them to hallucinate or become violent.", "authors": ["Vivek Chaudhary For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/12/19584544-0-image-a-83_1570792152941.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
