Unfortunately we could not find a photo of a living Berardius minimus.\n\nScientists have confirmed that small, black-beaked whales spotted by Japanese whalers are an entirely new species, according to a new study.\n\nHokkaido whalers had long referred to two types of whales as tsuchi-kujira, a name that encompassed the Baird\u2019s beaked whale, called Berardius bairdii, and a smaller black whale, called kuro-tsuchi (or karasu, meaning crow). Scientists had previously performed a genetic analysis that revealed the smaller whales didn\u2019t seem to match the tsuchi-kujira. Now they\u2019re ready to declare the whale a separate species, with the name Berardius minimus.\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting announcement. \u201cA species of 6 to 7 metre whale was not scientifically recognised until the 21st Century!\u201d Tadasu K. Yamada, study first author and curator emeritus Tadasu K. Yamada of the National Museum of Nature and Science in Japan, told Gizmodo in an email. \u201cAnecdotal knowledge of \u2018karasu\u2019 was confirmed finally!\u201d\n\nThe smaller whale has long existed in traditional knowledge, thanks to its black colour. Researchers began studying stranded carcasses of the smaller whale, most notably a severely decomposed 2008 specimen whose crescent-shaped blowhole indicated it was a member of the Berardius genus. They published a genetic analysis of the specimens in 2013, and fully described the new species in a paper published last week in Scientific Reports.\n\nB. minimus differs from the other species in its genus by its relatively small size, since it\u2019s just 6 to 7 meters compared to the other species\u2019 10 metres. It\u2019s also black and has different proportions, including a smaller beak. Researchers have not found adult female specimens yet.\n\nUnidentified beaked whales in the Nemuro Strait.

Yamada et al., Scientific Reports)\n\nOne researcher not involved with the study, research program officer Dee Allen at the Marine Mammal Commission in the United States, found the work convincing. \u201cThe fact that we are STILL discovering new species in our oceans \u2014 in this case, animals as big as 6.9 metres! \u2014 is what makes science, and especially ocean science, so exciting,\u201d she told Gizmodo in an email.\n\nBeaked whales are an elusive group of mammals that can dive to thousands of feet below the ocean\u2019s surface and stay submerged for over an hour. Their behaviour makes them difficult to study, and researchers only have stranded whales and lucky sightings to base their work on. Several other new beaked whale species have been described since 1990, Allen said.\n\nStudy author Takashi Matsuishi, professor at Hokkaido University, told Gizmodo in an email that the study relied on Marine Mammal Stranding networks, systems used to relay information about stranded and recently deceased marine mammals in order to allow researchers to take data on the animals. He also credited the expertise of locals; one fisherman, Kenji Sakurai, assisted in analysis and would come armed to the site to protect carcasses from hungry bears.\n\nThere\u2019s more that researchers hope to learn about this species. The Berardius genus already confused scientists, who have debated whether two other, similar-looking populations, B. bairdii and B. arnuxii, were separate species. Now that researchers classify these groups as separate species, they\u2019d like to know when B. minimus separated from the other two.\n\nResearch like this once again shows that there\u2019s a ton of information left to be gleaned from our oceans \u2014 and that non-scientists who are closely tied to these ecosystems can offer valuable knowledge and resources to scientific projects.", "description": "Scientists have confirmed that small, black-beaked whales spotted by Japanese whalers are an entirely new species, according to a new study....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/yzho6qyo2mgb7ozwx687.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
