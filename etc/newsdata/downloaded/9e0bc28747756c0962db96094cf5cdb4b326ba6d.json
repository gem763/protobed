She knows the words to \u201cI\u2019m a Little Teapot.\u201d Her dimples are disarming.\n\nHer parents didn\u2019t want their daughter to dance. They didn\u2019t want her to sing. They wanted her to die with them for their cause.\n\nLast year, when she was 7, Ais squeezed onto a motorcycle with her mother and brother. They carried a packet that Ais refers to as coconut rice wrapped in banana leaves. Her father and other brother climbed onto a different bike with another parcel. They sped toward a police station in the Indonesian city of Surabaya, a place of mixed faith.\n\nThe parcels were bombs, and they were set off at the gate to the police station. Catapulted off the motorcycle by the force of the explosion, Ais rose from the pavement like a ghost, her pale head-to-toe garment fluttering in the chaos. Every other member of her family died. No bystanders were killed. The Islamic State militant group, halfway across the world, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAis, who is being identified by her nickname (pronounced ah-iss) to protect her privacy, is now part of a deradicalization program for children run by the Indonesian Ministry of Social Affairs. In a leafy compound in the capital, Jakarta, she bops to Taylor Swift, reads the Quran and plays games of trust.\n\nHer schoolmates include children of other suicide bombers, and of people who were intent on joining the Islamic State in Syria.\n\nEfforts by Indonesia, home to the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, to purge its society of religiously inspired extremism are being watched keenly by the international counterterrorism community. While the vast majority of Indonesians embrace a moderate form of Islam, a series of suicide attacks have struck the nation, including, in 2016, the first in the region claimed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\nNow, with hundreds of Islamic State families trying to escape detention camps in Syria amid Turkish incursions into Kurdish-held territory, the effort has taken on more urgency. The fear is that the Islamic State\u2019s violent ideology will not only renew itself in the Middle East, but may also metastasize thousands of miles away in Indonesia.\n\nThere are signs that it is already happening.\n\nLast week, a man whom the police linked to ISIS wounded the Indonesian security minister, Wiranto, in a stabbing. Since then, at least 36 suspected militants who were plotting bombings and other attacks have been arrested in a counterterrorism crackdown, the police said this week.\n\nHundreds of Indonesians went to Syria to fight for ISIS. In May, the police arrested seven men who had returned from the country and who, the police say, were part of a plot to use Wi-Fi to detonate explosive devices.\n\nThe risks, however, are not limited to those who have come back. Indonesians who never left the region are being influenced by the Islamic State from afar.\n\nIn January, an Indonesian couple who had tried but failed to reach Syria blew themselves up at a Roman Catholic cathedral in the southern Philippines. More than 20 were killed in the attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State.\n\nIn Indonesia, there are thousands of vulnerable children who have been indoctrinated by their extremist parents, according to Khairul Ghazali, who served nearly five years in prison for terrorism-related crimes. He said he came to renounce violence in jail and now runs an Islamic school in the city of Medan, on the island of Sumatra, that draws on his own experience as a former extremist to deradicalize militants\u2019 children.\n\n\u201cWe teach them that Islam is a peaceful religion and that jihad is about building not destroying,\u201d Khairul said. \u201cI am a model for the children because I understand where they come from. I know what it is like to suffer. Because I was deradicalized, I know it can be done.\u201d\n\nDespite the scale of the country\u2019s problem, only about 100 children have attended formal deradicalization programs in Indonesia, Khairul said. His madrassa, the only one in Indonesia to receive significant government support for deradicalization work, can teach just 25 militant-linked children at a time, and only through middle school.\n\nGovernment follow-up is minimal. \u201cThe children are not tracked and monitored when they leave,\u201d said Alto Labetubun, an Indonesian terrorism analyst.", "description": "MEDAN, Indonesia -- Ais likes to dance.
