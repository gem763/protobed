Menus during the study period varied from days with no vegetarian or vegan dishes to those where they comprised 75 per cent of the options.\n\nAnalysis revealed that doubling the vegetarian offerings on a given menu from a quarter to a half of available choices increased the vegetarian option's share of sales by almost 15 per cent.\n\nCaterers in the third college teamed up with the researchers for a term-long experiment in which lunchtime menus were varied between the standard of one veggie option and two.\n\nThe team found that doubling the vegetarian lunch options increased the proportion of vegetarian sales by 8 per cent.\n\n'One of the exciting things about this study is the scale of information on individual diners' choices,' said paper co-author and conservation scientist Andrew Balmford.\n\n'It allowed us to test for rebound effects, when customers compensate for less meat at lunch by eating more in the evening. We found little evidence of this.'\n\n'We discovered that changing the relative availability of vegetarian options had the strongest effect on those who usually eat more meat.' said Balmford.\n\nThe study of data on over 94,000 meal selections in three of the university's colleges is the first to show that diversifying meal options can nudge diners to vegetarianism\n\n'Shifting to a more plant-based diet is one of the most effective ways of reducing the environmental footprint of food,' said Ms Garnett.\n\nMeat-rich diets are a key driver of species loss and climate change.\n\nDairy, egg, fish and meat farms account for around 58 per cent of the greenhouse gases generated by global food production and make up 83 per cent of its land use, despite only contributing to around 18 per cent of the world's caloric intake.\n\nThe catering service at Cambridge University has slashed its carbon footprint by almost 11 per cent by taking beef and lamb off of its menus. Pictured, King's College, Cambridge\n\n'Replacing some meat or fish with more vegetarian options might seem obvious, but as far as we know no one had tested it before. Solutions that seem obvious don't always work, but it would appear that this one does,' she added.\n\n'Education is important but generally ineffective at changing diets. Meat taxes are unpopular,' said paper author Theresa Marteau, a behaviour and health expert.\n\n'Altering the range of available options is more acceptable, and offers a powerful way to influence the health and sustainability of our diets.'\n\nResearchers found that raising the number of veggie option from one- to two-in-four had the biggest effect on regular meat eaters but did not affect overall meal sales\n\nThe team are helping to shape Cambridge's food policy, with the University Catering Service working to reduce meat options.\n\nKey to this effort has been the elimination of beef and lamb \u2014 which are the biggest contributors of meat-based greenhouse gases \u2014 from menus.\n\nIn fact, the service \u2014 which runs the university's central cafeterias that are separate from the dining facilities provided in individual colleges \u2014 announced earlier this month that such changes had cut its carbon footprint by 11 per cent.\n\nMeat-based diets, in comparison to vegetarian ones, generate more harmful greenhouse gases and require more land for their production\n\n'Universities are increasingly at the forefront of providing plant-based options that are affordable and delicious, making it easier to choose a more sustainable diet,' said Ms Garnett.\n\n'I think that's what really has to change. We're not saying all cafeterias and restaurants should turn vegan overnight.'\n\n'But if food were the film industry, vegetarian and vegan meals need to land more starring roles, and meat dishes have got to stop hogging the limelight.'\n\n'Flexitarianism is on the rise. Our results show that caterers serving more plant-based options are not just responding to but also reshaping customer demand.'\n\n'Simple changes such as increasing the proportion of vegetarian options could be usefully scaled up, helping to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "description": "Experts from Cambridge's geography, public health and zoology departments collected a year's worth of cafeteria sales data - amounting to over 94,000 meal choices - from three of the university's colleges.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/14/19108438-0-image-a-75_1569848886499.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
