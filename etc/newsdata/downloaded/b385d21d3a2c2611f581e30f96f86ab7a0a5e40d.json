It's just basic arithmetic here, and if we don't want coal to provide much of it because coal is by far the most carbon-intensive fuel then oil and gas will have to play a role going forward.\n\n\"I make no apology for BP continuing to invest in oil and gas.\"\n\nIn May, BP shareholders passed a resolution with 99 per cent support requiring BP to spell out a strategy consistent with the goals of the Paris climate accord of December 2015. A second resolution that would have required BP to set goals for \"Scope 3\" emissions - those emitted by its suppliers and customers - was rejected.\n\nMr Dale said energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage and hydrogen would be important areas alongside renewable energy to meet the net zero emissions goal.\n\nCarbon capture was one technology that is still not playing a role anywhere near to the one it needs to, he said, urging governments to provide incentives either through a carbon price or another means of support.\n\n\"That's a key technology and I think potentially it can play a role in Australia both in terms of its power system in the near term ... but also going forward in terms of the development of clean hydrogen within different parts of the world, including in Australia.\"", "description": "Delaying the inevitable move toward net zero emissions makes the inevitable transition more costly and chaotic, says BP's chief economist, Spencer Dale.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4816%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_458%2C$y_130/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d53407aed44e2f85be94b81a750dd371c75daee4", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
