REUTERS/Manaure Quintero\n\nTrump is under fire over his request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for an investigation into Joe Biden, a leading Democratic candidate to challenge him in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised, because that\u2019s what Donald Trump does every day against Venezuela,\u201d said Maduro, whom Trump and dozens of other nations in the West and around Latin America have said rigged a 2018 election and is thus a usurper.\n\nThe leftist Venezuelan leader accused Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of bombarding foreign leaders and officials with calls threatening to withdraw aid and block loans as part of their campaign to topple him.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump should have a thousand impeachments against him for the thousand calls and thousand acts of extortion he has carried out against governments to harm Venezuela,\u201d Maduro added at a news conference in Caracas.\n\nSome analysts believe the impeachment inquiry may distract Trump from foreign policy priorities, including leading international efforts against Maduro.\n\nBut the Venezuelan leader did not share that view.\n\n\u201cWhat is going to change towards Venezuela? Nothing. Because that is the policy of the empire,\u201d Maduro said.\n\n\u201cThey believe Latin America and the Caribbean is their backyard and belongs to them ... If they checked all (Trump\u2019s) calls in the last year, they would find enough evidence to prove the abuse of power against noble Venezuela.\u201d\n\nWashington recognizes Congress head and opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s interim leader, but Maduro retains power due to the loyalty of the armed forces and international support from China and Russia.\n\nBoth the United States and European Union (EU) slapped new sanctions on Maduro\u2019s government last week, demanding free elections as the way out of Venezuela\u2019s political crisis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not bothered by the European Union sanctions. We laugh at the European Union sanctions,\u201d scoffed Maduro, casting the bloc as a failed group following U.S. orders.\n\nOpposition leader Guaido welcomed the new EU travel bans and asset freezes on another seven Venezuelan officials, saying it demonstrated the global pressure on Maduro.\n\n\u201cWhile the regime is alone and exposed, we are advancing on all fronts,\u201d he told a news conference.", "description": "Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, under fire all year to quit from the United States and its allies, exulted on Monday in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, though he did not expect the White House to let up against him.", "authors": ["Shaylim Valderrama", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435645918&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1EA", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
