Make introductions. Offer thanks, express optimism, maybe crack a joke. Clear the room of onlookers, and off you go.\n\nBut Robert O\u2019Hara had a more pointed agenda in mind when he found himself in a ring of 75 actors and designers and producers one midsummer morning, in a studio lined by a wheelbarrow, a four-poster bed, and refreshments labeled \u201c dildo cornbread\u201d and \u201cnuts cake.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Hara is the director of \u201cSlave Play,\u201d Jeremy O. Harris\u2019s raunchy, riveting and risky new work, whose many provocations begin with its double entendre title. Mr. O\u2019Hara, like Mr. Harris and many members of the cast and crew, is black. So with just four weeks to go until the first preview, he ignored the naughtily named snacks and invoked his forebears.\n\n\u201cFor many years of my life, I\u2019ve had random white people come to me and ask me about where my last name came from, and I would just look them in the face and say, very politely: \u2018Slavery\u2019,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hara told the rapt gathering at New 42nd Street Studios, quieting the lingering chitchat. \u201cI just want us all to be mindful that it\u2019s because of what our ancestors endured \u2014 and survived, and abolished \u2014 that we have the audacity to be in this room.\u201d", "description": "Risky?
