Powell said the central bank will resume purchases of Treasury securities in an effort to avoid a repeat of recent turmoil in money markets. (Daniel Brenner/Bloomberg).\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said Tuesday the central bank will begin buying more Treasury bonds \u201csoon\" in order to keep the plumbing of the U.S. financial system running smoothly.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and I will soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time,\u201d Powell said at the National Association of Business Economics meeting in Denver, Colorado. \u201cThis is not QE.\"\n\nPresident Trump wants the Fed boost the economy ahead of the 2020 election with lower interest rates and big purchases of Treasury bonds, an action known as \u201cquantitative easing,\" or QE. He has pressed Powell and the Fed to make these changes for months, but Powell has long insisted that he will not change course based on political pressure.\n\nThe Fed chair did not specify the exact size of the new asset purchase program, but he said it would not be a resurrection of what they did after the recession 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cI want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis,\u201d Powell said.\n\nIn an effort to pump more money into the financial system, the Fed went from holding less than $1 trillion in assets in 2007 to $4.5 trillion in 2015. The Fed has gradually trimmed its holdings back under $4 trillion as the economy has improved, but that action has shrunk the level of reserves available to banks.\n\nThere was alarm on Wall Street last month when there did not appear to be enough reserves in the system and the overnight borrowing rates that banks use to ensure they have enough capital on hand spiked to levels not seen since the financial crisis.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York took swift action to pump additional reserves into the system for several days, but many analysts said the Fed needed a more permanent fix. Powell\u2019s announcement Tuesday was a widely anticipated move that is meant to prevent a repeat of what occurred in September. The final details should be announced at the Fed\u2019s next meeting and press conference on October 30.\n\nPowell stressed that the Fed\u2019s goal is to keep the economy on solid footing, not to give it a sugar high.\n\n\u201cI balk at the idea that we\u2019re running the economy hot, this feels very sustainable,\u201d Powell.\n\nHis remarks come as the U.S. manufacturing sector struggles to get out of a recession, and many economists have been downgrading their economic growth forecasts for next year to below 2 percent.\n\nPowell left the door open to additional rate cuts to protect the U.S. economy from weak growth abroad and Trump\u2019s trade war, but he did not promise lower rates.\n\nWall Street is pricing in nearly an 85 percent chance of a rate cut in October. The expectation of a rate cut this month jumped after Powell\u2019s remarks.\n\nRelated:\n\nFed Chair Powell takes heat from Trump and Wall Street over his communication style\n\nTrump faces crucial decision on China as both economies strain", "description": "'I balk at the idea that we\u2019re running the economy hot, this feels very sustainable,' Powell said at the National Association for Business Economics meeting in Colorado.", "authors": ["Heather Long", "Economics Correspondent", "October At Pm", "Heather Long Is An Economics Correspondent.
