When Blair\u2019s A Journey was published in 2010 \u2013 amid cancellation of launch events over protests from anti-war campaigners \u2013 it sold 92,060 copies in its first four days on sale. At the time, this made it the fastest-selling autobiography since Nielsen began to track book sales in 1998.\n\nFor the Record: David Cameron's memoir is honest but still wrong Read more\n\nCameron\u2019s sales make For the Record the bestselling non-fiction hardback of the week, and the second bestselling book overall, behind Atwood\u2019s much-anticipated follow-up to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which sold 103,177 copies in hardback in its first five days.\n\nBlair has sold almost 350,000 copies of his autobiography to date, but lost the title of fastest-selling memoir in 2013 when Manchester United football manager Alex Ferguson\u2019s memoirs shifted 115,000 in the first week.\n\nIn comparison, John Major sold just 5,415 copies of his memoir in its first week, but went on to top 200,000 in total. Edward Heath\u2019s The Course of My Life, published in 1998, has yet to top 20,000 copies, while Gordon Brown\u2019s My Life, Our Times has sold 27,846 altogether.\n\nAll pale in comparison to Margaret Thatcher, whose memoir The Downing Street Years is believed to have shifted 120,000 copies in a week (an estimated figure as it was published before Nielsen\u2019s records began). It has sold more than 500,000 copies since.\n\nCameron\u2019s publisher Harper Collins said it was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the figures and that the memoir\u2019s audiobook had been its biggest ever in the first week of release.\n\nRichard Humphreys, nonfiction buyer for Waterstones, said all signed copies of the memoir had sold out: \u201cWe are very pleased with how well the book has done \u2026 prime ministerial memoirs are always keenly awaited and despite the controversy of his exit from Downing Street and the subsequent political tumult, this has been a widely sought after book in our shops.\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s 700-page book, dealing with the former prime minister\u2019s decision to call a referendum on British membership of the European Union in 2016, was described as a truthful account by Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian. But Freedland found that the \u201clitany of confessed errors gradually loses its charm\u201d, and \u201cat a certain point, the reader stops feeling sympathy for the author and concludes that he was just serially and unforgivably wrong. For the Record is meant to be the case for the defence. In fact, Cameron has written his own indictment.\u201d\n\nIn the Telegraph, Allison Pearson found similarly, calling it \u201can exhaustive (and exhausting) case for the Defence\u201d, in which \u201cthe author is like a driver who, in a moment of madness, caused an almighty pile-up and tries to convince a jury to go easy on him, offering plentiful evidence of previous good conduct.\u201d\n\nWriting in the Standard, editor George Osborne, who was Cameron\u2019s chancellor, found it to be \u201cone of the very best\u201d political memoirs, although he admitted he was not neutral because Cameron is his friend. \u201cHis book has been so hard for him to write. It\u2019s been a kind of purgatory for him, motivated by a sense of duty that prime ministers should explain why they did what they did, for the record. It\u2019s why it is so good,\u201d wrote Osborne.", "description": "For the Record, the former PM\u2019s account of his time in office sold close to 21,000 copies in its first week, behind Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, which topped 100,000", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f0e5292bc29fc8f9ddef397769a2e3e58cd023/0_244_5868_3521/master/5868.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33293d2ad34cac6bba2ead1256e80261", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
