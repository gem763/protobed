It might have just gotten easier.\n\nThe ACT announced the changes on Tuesday, saying they're meant to better serve students. But the modifications may give even more advantages to rich students, close observers say.\n\nThe ACT is one of two national tests many colleges use to judge students\u2019 readiness for college. It considers four subject areas: English, math, reading and science, plus an optional writing test. The other test is the SAT, run by the College Board. The two tests both require most students to pay a fee, among other similarities, and most selective colleges will take results from either assessment.\n\nBut the testing companies are in fierce competition with each other. The ACT used to be the more widely used test, but the SAT overtook it in recent years. In 2018, 1.9 million took the ACT, and 2.1 million took the SAT.\n\nStakes for both tests are high: Former ACT/SAT test administrator pleads guilty in college admissions scandal\n\nStarting in fall 2020, students will be able to retake specific subject areas of the ACT where they did poorly, for a fee. In the past, students had to retake the whole test if they wanted to improve their score.\n\nStudents must have taken the test in full at least once before they can retake individual sections. The test can also now be taken digitally at a testing center when it's administered nationally. That means test-takers will get their results more quickly, ACT officials say.\n\nThe SAT is changing too: Testing company to add 'disadvantage' score to some students' exams\n\nThe changes are meant to better serve students and spare them unnecessary time taking tests, said Mary Michael Pontzer, a vice president at ACT. She said the changes were not taken for the sake of being competitive with SAT or to increase the ACT's market share.\n\n\"ACT is a nonprofit organization. We're mission driven. This is about the students,\" Pontzer said. \"We're excited to see how these new options will help students reach their maximum potential.\"\n\nThe company said the actual material in the test would remain the same.\n\nThe change with the greatest potential to affect college admissions is the introduction of a \u201csuperscore.\u201d It applies to students who have taken the test more than once, and it\u2019s a composite score of their best results in each subject.\n\nColleges don\u2019t have to use the \u201csuperscore,\u201d and they could opt to use scores from a single test. Many colleges, however, already consider a students\u2019 best scores across multiple tests.\n\nPontzer said ACT had coordinated with some higher education officials, and the company thinks it has support from them.\n\nStill, some say the advent of one-subject testing and \"superscores\" could benefit the wealthy and add unnecessary stress to a culture already hyper-focused on test scores.\n\nHigh-stakes testing: Reports of leaked SAT leave students wondering about integrity of test\n\nThe changes \"privilege the privileged,\" said Adam Ingersoll, a co-founder of test-prep firm Compass Education Group. They\u2019re the ones with the resources to pay the fee to retake the test multiple times.\n\nThe standard version of the test costs $52, and $68 with the writing option. Some students are eligible for fee waivers. The ACT said it would say later this year how much it would cost to retake individual sections of the test. Pontzer said the fee would be lower to retake specific sections than to retake the full test.\n\n'What makes your child entitled?': Judge takes on privilege as she sentences parents in college scam\n\nThe new policy could also have the effect of inflating test scores. Already, Ingersoll said, a high score is increasingly necessary for admission at highly selective colleges. Still, he said, high scores \"are increasingly common and thus non-distinguishing.\"\n\nThe option to retake may be good for some students, but it also could become another form of stress, said Jayne Caflin Fonash, president of National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\nFor a student who did poorly in just one section but overall did well, retaking one section may be helpful, she said. But it's sometimes a better use of a student's time to develop other parts of their life, rather than trying to improve already good test scores.\n\nWhat about parents who cheated?

Deacon, dean of admissions at Georgetown University, wrote his initial reaction is the college would not accept \"individual subscore results\" or a \"superscore.\" But he said given that the new policies don't take place until 2020, \"there will be ample time to study the impact of such changes and announce any adjustments of current policies if appropriate.\"\n\nWhile the ACT and SAT tweak their tests, a growing number of colleges are giving students the choice to opt out of submitting a test score. These colleges say doing so opens the door to disadvantaged students who may not otherwise apply. Test-optional colleges are often smaller, private schools, but they do include larger entities, such as the University of Chicago.\n\nThe changes in the ACT may drive more colleges that way, said Akil Bello, a founder and former CEO of the test-prep company Bell Curves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reason to go test-optional because there\u2019s a lot of mess in the system,\u201d Bello said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/10/08/act-test-changes-score-retake-sections-prep-college-admissions/3909233002/", "description": "Students will be able to retake sections of the ACT test.
