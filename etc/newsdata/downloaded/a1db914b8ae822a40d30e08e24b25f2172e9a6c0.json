I\u2019m off the fence \u2014 this movie is immoral bulls\u2014t.\u201d\n\nWarners Bros. did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\n\u201cIn actuality, the most morally questionable aspect of the film is the use of a Gary Glitter song, and the film is well aware of this,\u201d tweeted Darren Mooney, a columnist for the Escapist Magazine film blog. \u201cThe decision to pay a pedophile royalties is indefensible.\u201d\n\nGadd released \u201cRock & Roll (Part 2)\u201d as a single in 1972. It was his only major hit in the U.S., though the song remained popular in the decades that followed due in part to being played frequently at professional sporting events.\n\nCombined U.S. ticket sales for screenings of \u201cJoker\u201d this weekend amounted to about $96.2 million, setting a new monthly box-office record.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
