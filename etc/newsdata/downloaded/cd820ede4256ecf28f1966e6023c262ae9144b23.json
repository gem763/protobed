Fuel supply to the Eastern and Central regions is more than adequate for civilian purposes. The real motive behind this attempt is to set up a new illegitimate entity for the illegal export of oil from Libya,\u201d NOC\u2019s chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cLet us be clear, if NOC loses its oil export monopoly, the future integrity of Libya is at grave risk,\u201d Sanalla noted.\n\n\u201cNOC is exploring all legal and diplomatic measures, and puts all companies operating on the oil market on notice that any attempt to deal or sign contracts with this false company is a clear violation of Security Council resolutions,\u201d the state oil firm\u2019s chairman said.\n\nRelated: Trump Clashes With California Over Fuel Regulations\n\nA serious internal conflict within Libya\u2019s already fractured oil sector could, once again, result in volatile oil production levels from one of the wildest cards in the oil market in the past half-decade.\n\nThe security situation in Libya has worsened since the spring after eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar ordered in early April his Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on the capital Tripoli. The self-styled army has been clashing with troops of the UN-backed government in a renewed confrontation that has escalated and disrupted, once again, Libya\u2019s oil production and exports.\n\nTwo outages at the biggest oil field Sharara in one month forced Libya\u2019s oil production down to below 1 million bpd in the first week of August\u2014the lowest level in five months and a sign of Libya\u2019s wild card status in terms of production consistency. The outage at Sharara resulted in Libya\u2019s average crude oil production declining by 21,000 bpd month on month in August, to 1.056 million bpd from 1.078 million bpd in July, according to OPEC\u2019s secondary sources.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Libya\u2019s NOC condemned the setting up of a parallel board of directors at one its key subsidiaries, in what looks like a breakaway from the main company", "authors": ["Tsvetana Paraskova"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
