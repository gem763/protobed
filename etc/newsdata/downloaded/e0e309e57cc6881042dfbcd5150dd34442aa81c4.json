He added his second with a touch from close range in the 65th after Lucas P\u00e9rez had equalized for the visitors with a neat bicycle kick in the 50th. Gerard Moreno scored the third after another fast break in the 84th, and substitute Javier Ontiveros closed the scoring from a free kick in stoppage time.\n\nThe result leaves Villarreal with the league\u2019s best attack with 24 goals, one more than Barcelona.\n\n\u201cWe have a very good attack and we need to keep working to continue like this until the end of the season,\u201d said Ekambi, the forward from Cameroon who has five league goals, all scored in the last four matches.\n\nMoreno has seven goals, tied with Real Betis\u2019 Loren Mor\u00f3n as the league\u2019s top scorer.\n\nIt was the ninth straight winless away match for Alav\u00e9s. It had beaten Villarreal five times in the last six league games between the teams.\n\n\u201cWe had our chances, but their second goal made it difficult for us,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Karl Toko Ekambi scored a goal in each half as Villarreal beat Alav\u00e9s 4-1 to move closer to the top of the Spanish league on Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
