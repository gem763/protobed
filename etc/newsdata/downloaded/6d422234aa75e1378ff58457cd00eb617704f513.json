Viral Press\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t understand me due to the language barrier, so he referred me to the woman sitting at the counter next to him \u2013 she too was having difficulty understanding.\u201d\n\nMs Khalil was passed on to another male member of staff, who had a lengthy phone conversation before informing her she couldn\u2019t eat anything on board flight TK17.\n\n\u201cI agreed and said it was fine, I pack my own food for flights anyway,\u201d she said.\n\nThe man said the airline required Ms Khalil to sign a statement to the effect that she promised not to eat on board the aircraft, before telling her she couldn't fly at all following another phone call.\n\n\u201cHe eventually returned and told me I couldn\u2019t fly because they require 24 hours\u2019 notice of an allergy,\u201d said Ms Khalil, who pointed out that no such requirement is advertised on the Turkish Airlines website. \u201cAll he said to me was, \u2018this is what operations have told me, if you have any issues you can contact customer relations.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith no alternative, Ms Khalil and her husband went to the airline\u2019s helpdesk to change their tickets, only to be told they would have to pay $1,800 (\u00a31,442) to rebook on the next flight, which wasn\u2019t until the following day.\n\nMs Khalil called the experience \u201can ordeal\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have been flying my entire life, and have never had an experience like this before.\n\n\u201cI was devastated when the entire ordeal was happening, and felt completely helpless in that no one was even listening to me when I explained that I was following the exact same procedure in Istanbul as I did in Toronto.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThey put a huge damper on what was a beautiful vacation that we had been looking forward to. The stress of finding and paying for accommodation for one more night in Istanbul took a major toll on me and my husband.\u201d\n\nTurkish Airlines offered no assistance, no help with finding overnight accommodation and no adjustment to the regular ticket pricing, according to Ms Khalil.\n\nIn addition to the outlay for new flights and a hotel room for the night, Ms Khalil also lost income from having to reschedule her following day\u2019s clients.\n\n\u201cWe deserve not only compensation for the financial loss this caused, but also for the emotional toll it took on us,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt discriminated against, and I felt that my rights were completely violated in this situation.\u201d\n\nOn Turkish Airlines\u2019 website, the only allusion to allergies is the following: \u201cBe sure that you inform us of any allergies you may have for your in-flight meal.\u201d There is no mention of having to inform the airline when booking a ticket, nor a stipulation of a 24-hour cut-off point before the flight.\n\nA Turkish Airlines spokesperson told The Independent: \u201cTurkish Airlines has been contacted by the passenger who has shared her full experience.\n\n\u201cWe take allergy attacks extremely seriously and our priority is always to ensure our passengers are safe to enjoy a pleasant flight.\n\n\u201cThis matter is in the hands of our customer relations and customer services management team who are treating it with the utmost importance.\u201d\n\nThe airline came under fire earlier this year when a young man and his girlfriend were kicked off their UK-bound flight due to his nut allergy.", "description": "A passenger says she was left feeling \u201cdevastated\u201d and \u201chelpless\u201d after Turkish Airlines denied her boarding and forced her to pay almost \u00a31,500 for new flights, because she told them she had\u00a0a nut allergy.", "authors": ["Helen Coffey"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/27/11/istanbul-ataturk-airport.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
