Now several dancers and former dancers have claimed Epstein assaulted them, too.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Tuesday that \u2014 according to lawsuits filed against Epstein\u2019s estate in the days since he died, by suicide, in a Manhattan jail cell where he was being held on sex-trafficking charges \u2014 people in Epstein\u2019s circle had recruited some of his young victims from New York City dance studios. As with many of his other victims, Epstein allegedly lured the aspiring performers into his grasp through a network of recruiters under the pretense of assisting their careers.\n\nOne woman, identified in the lawsuit as Lisa, said a fellow dancer approached her after a ballet class in 2002 and recruited her to give Epstein private exercise classes at his Manhattan townhouse. Epstein was immediately overly familiar, demanding \u201cseveral sexually charged stretching activities,\u201d per the Times, and on the third visit, he requested a massage and then assaulted her with a sex toy and masturbated. She claims he implied it would be ruinous for her career if she didn\u2019t go along with it. Their abusive relationship allegedly continued for eight years. Following the initial attack, Lisa says Epstein gave her $300 and a book called Massage for Dummies.\n\nAnother dancer, referred to as Priscilla Doe in court documents, says she was recruited to give Epstein massages in 2006, when she was 20 years old. During her third massage appointment with Epstein, according to the Times, he assaulted her with his hands and with sex toys and told her that he could help her dancing career \u201cif she would do what he wanted to do.\u201d He continued to coerce her into sex until 2010, she says, and once held her down and threatened her after she posted on social media about traveling to his private island, leaving her \u201cin fear for her safety and her life.\u201d\n\nIn court papers, Priscilla Doe also claims Epstein flew her to Florida during his notoriously lenient 13-month stint in a state jail, during which he was allowed to spend 12 hours a day, six days a week outside of the facility on \u201cwork release.\u201d While the billionaire sex offender was technically incarcerated, the documents say, he had sex with Doe at his Palm Beach mansion \u2014 wearing his ankle monitor for the house arrest. Per the Times, she\u2019s not the only woman who claims Epstein flew her to Florida for sex while he was serving time.\n\nIn addition to reporting on lawsuits filed by women who say Epstein sexually exploited them, the Times spoke with a dancer named Marlo Fisken whom Epstein hired as a personal trainer in 2006, when she was in her early 20s. Fisken says she didn\u2019t work for him for long. The Times reports that, after a few sessions, Epstein asked her to \u201cmassage his testicles to help with flexibility,\u201d a request she refused to gratify.", "description": "New lawsuits allege that Jeffrey Epstein recruited and subsequently abused several young New York City dancers.", "authors": ["Hannah Gold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/03/3-jeffrey-epstein.w1200.h630.jpg"}
