But central-bank officials were split over Wednesday\u2019s decision and the outlook for further reductions.\n\n\u201cThere will come a time, I suspect, when we think we\u2019ve done enough. But there may also come a time when the economy worsens and we would then have to cut more aggressively,\u201d said Mr. Powell at a news conference Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell explaining the central bank's monetary-policy decision at news conference in Washington.

Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, ticked higher though held their recent range.\n\nMarkets have been looking to the Fed for more concrete promises of rate cuts, but Mr. Powell has been reluctant to make any. The trade-related risks are out of the Fed\u2019s control and difficult to predict, and officials are divided over how to respond.\n\nSeven of 10 Fed officials voted in favor of lowering the benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 1.75% and 2%, with two reserve bank presidents preferring to hold rates steady and one favoring a larger, half-point cut.\n\nThe Fed also on Wednesday injected money into the banking system for the second day in a row to ease a crunch in overnight funding markets, and said it would do so again on Thursday. The operations are aimed at keeping the fed-funds rate in the central bank\u2019s target range.\n\nHolding Pace The Federal Reserve has joined other central banks in cutting rates in 2019. How central bank rates evolved this year Rate at the end of 2018 Current rate India Iceland Chile Russia Philippines Australia Serbia Brazil U.S. South Korea South Africa Mexico Hong Kong Thailand Japan Colombia U.K. Rates that did not change Switzerland Hungary Denmark China Euro area Canada Sweden Rates that increased Czech Republic Norway \u20132% 0 2 4 6 8\n\nMr. Powell said the funding issues and the Fed\u2019s operations \u201chave no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy.\u201d\n\nHe signaled concern that uncertainty about trade policy was chilling business investment and that a pullback in manufacturing activity would continue. But the U.S. consumer has been resilient this year, and a modest slowdown in the pace of hiring hasn\u2019t pushed the unemployment rate higher.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unusual situation,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cOur eyes are open. We\u2019re watching the situation. We\u2019ve cut rates twice.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has been under attack from President Trump to aggressively cut interest rates\u2014to boost stock markets and weaken the U.S. dollar\u2014after the White House\u2019s trade talks with China hit an impasse this spring. Mr. Trump had called for the Fed to cut rates by a half-point in April, but he has since said the Fed should lower rates more aggressively.\n\nLowered Expectations The Fed\u2019s forecasts of the federal-funds rate for the end of 2019 have changed over time. Circles below are sized according to the number of officials who set their projections to the corresponding rate for each release. Projected midpoint for rate at end of 2019 Target range following this quarter\u2019s release 10 officials 5 Seven of 17 officials projected one more quarter-point cut this year 4.0% 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 Sept. \u201917 Dec. March \u201918 June Sept. Dec. March \u201919 June Sept. Projection release date\n\nSoon after the Fed announced its rate cut Wednesday, Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Powell on Twitter. \u201cJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again,\u201d he wrote, one of 30 such statements about Fed policy since the July meeting. \u201cNo \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\u201d\n\nMr. Powell has repeatedly declined to respond to those attacks and did so again. \u201cI continue to believe that the independence of the Federal Reserve from direct political control has served the public well over time,\u201d he said Wednesday. The Fed \u201cwill continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s moves to shelve rate increases earlier this year and later to cut them twice this summer\u2014combined with broad declines in market-determined rates due to weak global-growth prospects\u2014have already led to lower borrowing costs for consumers buying cars or taking out mortgages.\n\nMr. Powell said officials still have a positive outlook for the U.S. economy. But he signaled less certainty about the rate path than at the Fed\u2019s late July meeting. The majority of Fed governors and reserve bank presidents who decide on policy \u201cis going meeting by meeting,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials expected the U.S. economy to slow this year, but increased uncertainty means they aren\u2019t sure if the economy is going to cool a little bit or a lot.\n\n\u201cThe idea that if you see trouble approaching on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can, I think that\u2019s a good idea in principle,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cApplying that principle in a particular situation is where the challenge comes.\u201d\n\nThe policy statement released after the meeting was little changed from July, when officials cut rates and held the door open to more reductions. Projections released after Wednesday\u2019s two-day meeting showed the extent of the split over the policy outlook, complicating the challenge facing Mr. Powell.\n\nSeven of 17 officials penciled in one more rate cut this year. The other 10 were split evenly between those who thought the new level of rates, after Wednesday\u2019s cut, would be appropriate through the rest of 2019 and those who thought rates shouldn\u2019t have been cut.\n\n\u201cA divided committee is not that surprising given there\u2019s a high level of uncertainty in the economic trajectory,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nThe Fed appears largely split between \u201cthose who believe the global situation is going to keep slowing the U.S. economy and threaten to unleash disinflation versus those who view the world as background noise and focus on domestic variables,\u201d said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you agree with the Fed\u2019s rate cut, and what do you think it signals about the U.S. economy?
