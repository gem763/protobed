(The Logic)\n\nTalking point: None of the proposals the leaders cited specifically target scale-ups; some of them\u2014like the Liberals\u2019 BDC funding pilot\u2014are specifically designed to help new or small firms, instead. That\u2019s in keeping with the election campaign so far. All four major parties have promised new restrictions or taxes on foreign tech giants, but none has pledged significant new programs or funding for fast-growing firms. The current Liberal government has retargeted some major business-support organizations\u2014like the Industrial Research Assistance Program and Sustainable Development Technology Canada\u2014onto bigger projects. The Conservative green-patent tax credit addresses the same cleantech IP protection concern as the current government\u2019s patent collective; the party\u2019s environmental plan also includes $250 million for green technology venture capital funds-of-funds, to which the Liberal government allocated $50 million.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
