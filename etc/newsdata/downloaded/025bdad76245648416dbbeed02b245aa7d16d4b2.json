Her husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\n\n\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment,\" she added.\n\nDr Michael Wardlow, chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said pregnancy discrimination was \"still all too common\".\n\n\"In spite of the legislation being in place for more than 40 years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it,\" he added.\n\nMcGrane Nurseries said it had engaged a human resources firm and was working with the Equality Commission to implement a \"series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgement of this case\".", "description": "Laura Gruzdaite was accused of \"skipping work\" despite telling bosses about a baby scan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0EBC/production/_108927730_lauragruzdaite3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
