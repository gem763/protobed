New England Patriots (4-0) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 1\n\nThe offense, and QB Tom Brady in particular, struggled at Buffalo. But the Patriots were bailed out by their defense and special teams. It\u2019s all but official that yet again there won\u2019t be a competitive race in the AFC East this season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2. Kansas City Chiefs (4-0) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 2\n\nPatrick Mahomes was not at his breathtaking best against the Lions. But it says plenty that he still was quite good and that he and the Chiefs found a way to win.\n\n3. Chicago Bears (3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 7\n\nThe defense is playing at a very high level again this season, and the loss of QB Mitchell Trubisky to a shoulder injury shouldn\u2019t be all that debilitating. Backup Chase Daniel is capable of giving the Bears what they need from the position.\n\n4. New Orleans Saints (3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 13\n\nThe Saints have beaten the Seahawks and Cowboys with Teddy Bridgewater at QB. He threw an early interception and took an ill-advised late sack Sunday night against Dallas, but four field goals and the play of the New Orleans defense were enough. The chances of the Saints holding things together until Drew Brees returns from his thumb surgery seem greatly improved.\n\n5. Seattle Seahawks (3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 15\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Seahawks rebounded from the loss to the Saints by taking care of business with the victory Sunday at Arizona. Now comes a quick turnaround for the big Thursday night meeting with the Rams.\n\n6. San Francisco 49ers (3-0) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 10\n\nThe 49ers return from their bye week as the NFC\u2019s lone unbeaten team. They won\u2019t be under the radar any longer.\n\n7. Los Angeles Rams (3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 3\n\nThat was an alarmingly poor performance in the loss to the Buccaneers. Jared Goff\u2019s 517 passing yards were offset by his three interceptions. The running game was nonexistent as Goff threw 68 passes. And what\u2019s with giving up 55 points to the Bucs? Coach Sean McVay had better come up with some answers quickly.\n\nAD\n\nWith the Cowboys\u2019 loss in New Orleans, there\u2019s no clear-cut team to beat in the NFC\n\n8. Dallas Cowboys (3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 4\n\nYes, the Superdome is loud and it\u2019s a tough place to play. But if the Cowboys are going to be a Super Bowl team, they simply have to be able to win a game like that, especially when the Saints are without Brees.\n\nAD\n\n9. Philadelphia Eagles (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 18\n\nThe triumph Thursday night at Lambeau Field kept the Eagles\u2019 season from unraveling any further, and Sunday\u2019s Cowboys loss was an added bonus for Philadelphia. That quickly, the Eagles are right back in the NFC East race.\n\nReplay reversals, goal-line stands give the Eagles a victory they badly needed in Green Bay\n\n10. Green Bay Packers (3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 5\n\nDoes anyone want to be the NFC\u2019s top team? The Packers\u2019 chance to stake their early-season claim came undone amid their offensive failures near the goal line in the loss Thursday night to the Eagles.\n\nAD\n\n11. Cleveland Browns (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 17\n\nThe win in Baltimore kept the Browns from being labeled an early-season bust. QB Baker Mayfield played well and the Browns showed versatility on offense, relying on RB Nick Chubb and WR Jarvis Landry, when the Baltimore defense made it clear that it would do whatever possible to take away WR Odell Beckham Jr. as an option for Mayfield.\n\nAD\n\n12. Buffalo Bills (3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 9\n\nThe Bills hung tough against the Patriots. They won\u2019t overtake New England in the division race but they showed that they could be a viable playoff contender. The playing status of QB Josh Allen becomes an issue after a hit Sunday that placed him in the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol.\n\nAD\n\n13. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 24\n\nThe Bucs don\u2019t get to pass the Rams in the rankings even with Sunday\u2019s big win. Not yet, at least. But maybe this is a promising team, after all. Perhaps Coach Bruce Arians indeed will get the best out of QB Jameis Winston.\n\n14. Los Angeles Chargers (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 19\n\nMelvin Gordon wasn\u2019t needed Sunday in the victory at Miami. But with the RB back in the fold after ending his holdout, the Chargers perhaps can find a way to recapture last season\u2019s form.\n\nAD\n\n15. Baltimore Ravens (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 6\n\nThat was an extremely disappointing performance Sunday in the loss at home to the Browns. The Ravens had appeared to be the AFC\u2019s third-best team, on the heels of the Patriots and Chiefs, after their competitive road loss at Kansas City. Instead, they came home and showed that they might be just another team, capable of reaching the AFC\u2019s upper tier but certainly not guaranteed of being there.\n\nAD\n\nThe Browns kept the Ravens from running away with the AFC North\n\n16. Carolina Panthers (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 20\n\nNo one is in a rush, it seems, for Cam Newton to return to the Panthers\u2019 lineup, given how Kyle Allen is playing as the fill-in starter at QB. Even Newton is vowing to take his time and allow his foot to heal properly. When Newton does return, the Panthers just might have a QB issue on their hands.\n\n17. New York Giants (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 21\n\nDaniel Jones made mistakes in his second NFL start in the win over the Redskins. But he still has two victories in two games since taking over at QB for Eli Manning, and hope has been restored.\n\n18. Jacksonville Jaguars (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 22\n\nAD\n\nRookie QB Gardner Minshew II and the Jaguars continue to reassemble their once-broken season even as the Jalen Ramsey saga plays out. Ramsey was on the inactive list Sunday in Denver after missing practice time last week because of the flu, back soreness and the birth of his child. With the Jaguars refusing to honor his trade request, it only gets more interesting.\n\nAD\n\n19. Detroit Lions (2-1-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 12\n\nThe near miss against the Chiefs seems to signal that Coach Matt Patricia has things headed in the right direction. That did not seem to be the case when the Lions struggled so badly last season after Patricia replaced the fired Jim Caldwell.\n\n20. Houston Texans (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 8\n\nThe Texans really should be better than this. Losing at home to the Newton-less Panthers simply is not acceptable.\n\nAD\n\n21. Tennessee Titans (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 23\n\nThe road triumph in Atlanta was surprising. Just when it seemed like time to consider giving up on Marcus Mariota as the long-term answer at QB, he came out and played extremely well.\n\nAD\n\n22. Oakland Raiders (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 25\n\nThe win in Indianapolis reinforces the notion that the Raiders are much improved this season, even after the Antonio Brown fiasco. The NFL\u2019s suspension of LB Vontaze Burfict for the remainder of the season for his illegal hit Sunday may or may not hold up on appeal. Either way, it\u2019s clear that the Raiders cannot count on Burfict, given his long history of being punished for repeated on-field transgressions.\n\n23. Indianapolis Colts (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 11\n\nThe loss at home to the Raiders puts the Colts in the thick of the middling teams in the AFC South and in the league. If the NFL wants \u201cany given Sunday\u201d parity, it has gotten it.\n\nAD\n\n24. Minnesota Vikings (2-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 14\n\nNew season, same old story for Kirk Cousins. It appears ever more certain that he\u2019s simply not the QB to get the Vikings or anyone else to the NFL\u2019s upper tier. But the Vikings are pretty much stuck with him, given the fully guaranteed contract they handed to Cousins before last season.\n\n25. Pittsburgh Steelers (1-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 26\n\nIf only the Steelers could play the Bengals every week, they\u2019d be fine. Mason Rudolph was sharp Monday night and the Steelers got into the win column. But that dink-and-dunk approach won\u2019t work against everyone.\n\n26. Atlanta Falcons (1-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 16\n\nThis is shaping up as an extremely disappointing season for the Falcons, especially given the opportunity they seemed to have in the NFC South with the QB injuries elsewhere to the Saints\u2019 Drew Brees and the Panthers\u2019 Cam Newton.\n\n27. Denver Broncos (0-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 27\n\nThe leads, early and late, slipped away against the Jaguars, and the Broncos\u2019 season is headed nowhere.\n\n28. Arizona Cardinals (0-3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 28\n\nSo much for Coach Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s system revolutionizing the way offense is played in the NFL. There was no reason for the Seahawks or anyone else to be particularly impressed Sunday.\n\n29. New York Jets (0-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 31\n\nThe Jets actually move up in the rankings by not playing, thanks to the woes of other teams. At least the Jets have some prospect of improving when QB Sam Darnold returns to the lineup.\n\n30. Cincinnati Bengals (0-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 30\n\nThis is looking hopeless, at least in the short term. QB Andy Dalton has no chance playing behind this depleted offensive line and without his top receiver, A.J. Green.\n\n31. Washington Redskins (0-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 29\n\nIt didn\u2019t make much sense to fire Jay Gruden this week, since an interim coach would have had to face the Patriots in his first game. But the Redskins face the Dolphins after the Patriots, so making the change next week could be in play if things go as expected this weekend.\n\n32. Miami Dolphins (0-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 32\n\nThe Dolphins actually had a lead Sunday before their inevitable loss. Does that qualify as them going off-script, however briefly?\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nThe Browns kept the Ravens from running away with the AFC North\n\nThis NFL season has been filled with injuries and controversies.
