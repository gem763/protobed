Video games don\u2019t usually work this way; you get what you get when it comes to dialogue options. But in Disco Elysium, you can devote your character\u2019s brain space to thinking about certain topics, thereby opening up more dialogue options when a certain topic arises again. On this week\u2019s Kotaku Splitscreen, Kirk told me how \u201cwild\u201d that is. (That\u2019s his word. He used it a lot.)\n\nFirst, we talk about the games we\u2019ve been playing, which in my case is Destiny 2 and Borderlands 3. Kirk beat Sayonara Wild Hearts before plunging into Disco Elysium. We then break for discussion of the news (32:23), touching on Kotaku\u2019s coverage of Pok\u00e9mon Go and privacy, Blizzard\u2019s approach to China and Hong Kong, and the Fortnite black hole. We close with off-topic talk (56:53) about books we\u2019re reading, plus Kirk\u2019s music pick of the week.\n\nGet the MP3 here, or read an excerpt below.\n\nMaddy: Is it bad wild or good wild?\n\nKirk: Very good wild. Very ambitious and creative and just... wild. I\u2019m very early in this game; I played a couple of hours, these are initial impressions. It could be that it turns out it\u2019s terrible at some point or another.\n\nMaddy: It\u2019s all gonna change. It\u2019s gonna get even more wild after the first two hours.\n\nKirk: I think that maybe it is! This game is made by a studio called ZA/UM. The lead writer and lead designer is a guy named Robert Kurvitz, who I\u2019ve seen some interviews with and read a little bit. He\u2019s been working on this game for 15 years.\n\nMaddy: Whoa.\n\nKirk: That\u2019s what they say, 15 years. And that should give you some sense of where we\u2019re going here. This game is legit wild. The closest comparison I can make is Planescape Torment. That\u2019s where this game draws its DNA from. It\u2019s very, very text-heavy. It\u2019s a role-playing game in the truest sense of the word.\n\nIt\u2019s all about playing a role, as a person. It takes that using the power of text, because it can go inside, do an inner monologue, and have all of these very complicated stat-check interactions. It\u2019s just not like any other RPG you\u2019ve played that looks like this.\n\nPremise first. It\u2019s kind of like a steampunk detective game. You\u2019re playing a specific character. He\u2019s this guy who wakes up, completely hungover, with no memory of where he is, in this hotel room \u2014\n\nMaddy: Classic noir setup.\n\nKirk: Classic noir setup! There\u2019s been a murder. He\u2019s a deadbeat cop. At that point, you basically just decide who he is. You can pick any of a ton of different personality traits and play him a bunch of different ways. You walk around in a kind of isometric point of view. It\u2019s very painterly looking. It\u2019s actually gorgeous; the art looks really cool.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about the world, because like I said, I\u2019ve only played a little bit. But it\u2019s very local. I get the feeling the whole game maybe takes place in this one district of this city, and you\u2019re trying to solve crimes and talk to people. There\u2019s probably a whole big story as you\u2019re investigating things.\n\nIt\u2019s very, very text-heavy. It\u2019s kind of like interactive fiction meets an isometric game. It all takes place during text, though there is voice acting, which so far I\u2019d say is pretty mixed. Some of the acting is good, some isn\u2019t. It has all the hallmarks of a game that was made by a small studio over a long period of time. Characters will talk a bit at first, then transition to just text.\n\nNow let me see if I can explain the wildness of this game. Your character\u2019s mind is its own whole collection of systems in the game, and each system is governed by statistics and roles, and you interact with it in different ways. So, as a basic example, you\u2019re really hungover and kinda messed up... Your partner comes to get you, you have a bunch of conversations with him.\n\nYou go out to his car, and you get on the radio to HQ. You have to call in and tell them that you lost your badge, which is apparently a very, very big deal. This is not going to be good. A lot of this is, you\u2019re learning this world as you go, and what things mean, because you don\u2019t know \u2014 it\u2019s a different world. There are different rules. Apparently, losing your badge is really bad. It\u2019s worse than you would think. It\u2019s not just, \u201cOh, I lost this thing, I need to get another one.\u201d\n\nMaddy: It\u2019s like losing your gun?\n\nKirk: Well, you lost your gun, too. That actually comes up in conversation.\n\nMaddy: [laughs] That\u2019s bad.\n\nKirk: It\u2019s a thing that will cause disgrace on your precinct for a generation, or something. So you call in, and the writing is all very funny and very good. It has this distinct vibe, off-kilter and odd, but good. You call in, you start talking to people, and in the middle of the conversation, you make a memory check, and you pass it. This all happens passively; it\u2019ll just be, you\u2019ll remember what the guy\u2019s name is, and then you can greet him by name. There are all these different checks that you\u2019ll make. You\u2019ll make an interfacing check to see if you can remember how to use the button to call in, or if you can\u2019t remember.\n\nWhen you\u2019re on the radio, you\u2019ll do a composure check, and it\u2019ll say: \u201cComposure check: Trivial. Passed.\u201d And it\u2019ll give you some kind of narration, like, \u201cYou now are able to keep your composure as you talk to these people.\u201d They begin making fun of you. You have an encyclopaedia skill that\u2019ll pop up and tell you as your brain remembers something. I\u2019m playing a high-intellect character, so I\u2019m able to remember things.\n\nIncreasingly the whole game is governed by these myriad, just unbelievable amount of stat checks that are happening under the hood, in your character\u2019s mind. It\u2019s all about role-playing every aspect of this person and their personality, as their own mind is almost like a foil that you\u2019re working against and changing the flow of the conversation based on how you\u2019re doing.\n\nMaddy: So do you change those stats according to which dialogue options you select? Or are you changing them manually? Or it\u2019s a dice roll? How do you know you\u2019re a high-intellect character, for example?\n\nKirk: I picked that at the beginning. You can be a brawler, a more direct character, or a high-intellect character. I should say, there is no normal combat in this game. This isn\u2019t a combat RPG. There are fights, but they all play out via the same stat checks, and just through text. It isn\u2019t like you\u2019re taking a critical shot and landing a hit. You do occasionally get in fights, but it\u2019s much more like a detective RPG. You\u2019re trying to solve mysteries and not going out and fighting random enemies.\n\nIt\u2019s all happening under the hood. I\u2019ve picked a character who\u2019s smart, so he knows things and remembers things, and I don\u2019t think is very strong or charismatic, maybe? But you can be a smooth operator. I have a feeling that this game totally branches and everybody changes, like everything changes in relation to you, so I think that who you play as and what you do, from what I\u2019ve gathered from the reviews that I\u2019ve skimmed, makes a huge difference.\n\nAndy Kelly, who wrote it up for PC Gamer, said that you don\u2019t want to exhaust every dialogue option, for example, because sometimes you\u2019ll just say some shit you shouldn\u2019t have said and make someone mad at you. Then they\u2019ll remember, and then later, they won\u2019t want to help you with something.\n\nMaddy: That rules, though, because so many games don\u2019t do anything even close to that, and you\u2019re supposed to exhaust every dialogue option. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re missing out on video game.\n\nKirk: Exactly. I think there are a lot of RPG tropes that this game completely throws out and replaces with this completely wild system of all of these interlocking inner systems... There\u2019s also a whole system of thoughts, and it\u2019s what your character is currently thinking about, and you can dedicate head space to a certain subject.\n\nIf you think about an argument that someone will make to you, you can chew over it for the next little while, and you\u2019ll make progress on that thought and you\u2019ll have new options when you go back to talk to them. It\u2019s so wild. I keep using that word, I guess. But it really feels transgressive, almost experimental, in a way that I haven\u2019t felt playing a game like this in a really long time. It\u2019s a trip.", "description": "In real life, if you think over an argument you had with someone, you\u2019ll probably come up with more ideas on what to say to them when you see them again.
