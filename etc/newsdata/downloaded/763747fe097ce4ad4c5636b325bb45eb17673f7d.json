Then, just as the coalition government came into power, the girl from Orpington pivoted towards outraged political comedy. She has gone on to become one of comedy\u2019s most articulate chronicler of the left\u2019s beleaguered decade. But what\u2019s consistent through both incarnations and into her recent show about motherhood is a personality that fizzes with fun and \u2013 Tories be damned! \u2013 an indomitable love of life. BL\n\n49\n\nTheir Brentford-set series followed a group of loserish friends, but its creators are anything but. Asim Chaudhry, Allan \u201cSeapa\u201d Mustafa, Steve Stamp and Hugo Chegwin gave the mockumentary a millennial spin with a web series that caught the eye of Office producers Roughcut. Over five series, the group nailed subcultural satire by drawing on their experiences in the world of garage MCing, making for a show that was authentic and absurd. With PJDN now over, the group seem to have the comedy world at their feet, with a film and a US version on its way. HJD\n\n48\n\nWhile Coel\u2019s statuesque skills have been lent to more serious thespian pursuits recently (2018\u2019s Black Earth Rising), her self-penned series Chewing Gum was a landmark. Based around Tracey, a neurotic 24-year-old living in a tower block in London, the show had all the appeal of an Inbetweeners-era coming-of-age sitcom (such as the scene in which she tries to lose her virginity in a disabled loo). But with its misfit lead navigating her sexuality and identity, it was a revelation for a generation of black women who were previously made to feel invisible in comedy. HG\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Doing it all ... Mindy Kaling. Photograph: Ramona Rosales\n\n47\n\nHad Mindy Kaling just written and appeared on The Office (US), revitalising a flagging show with her livewire neediness, she\u2019d make the list. Had she only written the books Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns) and Why Not Me?, she\u2019d make the list. Had she only made The Mindy Project, she\u2019d make the list. Had she only written and starred in the Emma Thompson film Late Night, there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019d make the list. But she\u2019s done all of these things, so question her place here at your peril. SH\n\n46\n\nSuspend your expectations of comedy: like his hero, the great Dutch comic Hans Teeuwen, Brookes is here to scramble your sense of what\u2019s happening on stage, what\u2019s up next and why the hell you\u2019re laughing. Maybe his antics \u2013 eyeballing his crowd, absenting himself, stretching his sinewy frame into odd shapes \u2013 relate to the currents of talking about incest, eco-angst and existential despair that pass for his material. Or maybe they\u2019re just what this \u201chipster Nosferatu\u201d finds funny. Either way, you can\u2019t take your eyes off him. BL\n\n45\n\nFans of the barrel-chested comic may have first witnessed him in Garth Marenghi\u2019s Darkplace, where his poker-faced arrogance became the stuff of cult worship. His roles often come from an alternate version of the 70s - his sophisticated, Bafta-winning Toast and its excellent interior design and music being one of the most innovative comedies on TV in years. While his face does minimal work, it\u2019s his voice \u2013 described as \u201cpart bounty hunter, part 70s porn star\u201d \u2013 that has soothed this century, from his BBC shorts to The IT Crowd, The Mighty Boosh, Snuff Box, House of Fools and yoghurt adverts. HG\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cinematic treat ... Dustin Demri-Burns and Seb Cardinal. Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian\n\n44\n\nWhen Cardinal Burns arrived on the comedy circuit, it was obvious from the quality performances, the sharp script and the range of characters that Seb Cardinal and Dustin Demri-Burns had talent. When their TV break came (on E4 then Channel 4), it wasn\u2019t just funny, it was a cinematic treat, both in how it looked, and how the sketches were like entire worlds to immerse yourself in. See their suburban Banksy, the Made in Chelsea spoof Young Dreams, and one-off sketches (their Clowns sketch is a beauty). PF\n\n43\n\nHannibal Buress would almost certainly like to be known for more than just being the guy who made a joke that triggered Bill Cosby\u2019s downfall. But in the US at least, Buress has long had a following, thanks to TV specials, late-night chatshow appearances and his role in Comedy Central sitcom Broad City. His onstage style is relaxed to the point of almost complete stillness, a sort of mumblecore standup. It is a red herring, though, as his material is astute and often fearless. PF\n\n42\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A rare thing ... Limmy.\n\nThe Glasgow comic, real name Brian Limond, is a rare thing in comedy: a comedian not known for panel show appearances or TV roles but rather for his online notoriety. His DIY efforts led to a linear series, Limmy\u2019s Show on BBC Scotland, but his success has largely been on his own terms (think podcasts, blogs, tweets and clips on now-deceased video service Vine). Dark, subversive, weird, sad and absurd yet universal, Limmy proves that doing it your own way \u2013 via the odd fake obituary \u2013 is a risk worth taking. HJD\n\n41\n\nThe \u201ccomedian\u2019s comedian\u201d, Lee is known for his meandering, oddball tales and surreal projects such as Jerry Springer: The Opera. Bridging the gap between 90s standup and the present (his influence is clear on bright, bizarre young things like James Acaster), Lee\u2019s recent show, Content Provider, tackled Brexit with brilliant amounts of bathos (\u201cOoh no,\u201d he coos on stage, \u201cI only wanted bendy bananas, and now there\u2019s this chaotic inferno of hate!\u201d). HJD\n\n40\n\nStandup in the 21st-century has been more emotionally intimate than anything we\u2019ve seen before \u2013 and no one bares more soul than Simon Amstell. Having started the millennium hosting trashy C4 show Popworld, a flit to standup recast this celebrity irritant as one of our most intense, and most fretful, comedians. His over-thinking, self-abasing work \u2013 minutely chronicling the emotional life of a gay, Jewish, vegan B-lister who questions everything \u2013 spans live comedy, cinema and sitcom (BBC2\u2019s Grandma\u2019s House), and is always brilliantly alive. BL\n\n39\n\nFor much of the millennium so far, British telly has been searching for its own Daily Show \u2013 a stringent, sassy topical comedy vehicle to help shape the nation\u2019s political conversation. The closest it\u2019s come has been The Mash Report, whose very own Jon Stewart is the standup Nish Kumar. A multiple Edinburgh Comedy award nominee, London boy Kumar is the smartest, and often the silliest, political comic we\u2019ve got: acute, furious and often the ridiculous fall guy of his own jokes. BL\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A masterclass ... Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele as Outkast. Photograph: Courtesy Eve/Rex Shutterstock\n\n38\n\nNow that Jordan Peele is a full-blown Hollywood darling, it\u2019s easy to forget where he came from. And that\u2019s a remarkable shame, because he came from Key and Peele, a Comedy Central show that burnished the art of sketch comedy to a golden sheen. Almost every sketch it ever produced is a masterclass of the form; perfect little nuggets of set-up, escalation and pay-off. Substitute Teacher, I Said Bitch, Turbulence, Outkast Reunion; these are all on YouTube and will improve your afternoon a hundredfold. SH\n\n37\n\nAs sketch comedy disappeared from TV screens, you could have been forgiven for thinking the artform was moribund. Far from it: the ex-Footlights trio Sheeps have twisted it into new shapes \u2013 most notably in 2014 show Wembley Previews, which featured one sketch, repeated in a dizzying array of styles. As if that weren\u2019t enough, one-third of the team, the morose Yorkshireman Liam Williams, launched a voice-of-his-generation solo career, which blazed across the standup stage and brought us the hit BBC4 YouTube spoof Pls Like, and People Time, made with peers Claudia O\u2019Doherty, Jamie and Natasia Demetriou and Ellie White. BL\n\n36\n\nCult comics Tim and Eric nailed the nightmarishness of American excess way before Trump-induced anxiety spread across world. Dragging a Gen X cynicism into the present day, their creations reflect the incessant yammering of advertising, reality TV surrealism and the onslaught of online images and information. Some of their humour has no deep meaning, either: the greasy-haired spook Spagett, waxy entertainer Casey Tatum, and heartbreak horror of Carol and Mr Henderson. From their Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! series to web shorts such as Tim\u2019s Kitchen Tips, their layered, abstract nihilism basically invented meme culture. HG\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mind-expanding ... Sara Pascoe. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian\n\n35\n\nYes, comedy has to be funny \u2013 but it can be mind-expanding, too, and never more so than in the work of Sara Pascoe. Even before her bestselling book about the female body, Animal, the Essex-born comic wore her erudition \u2013 and anthropological way of seeing the world \u2013 on her sleeve. The result was a series of cracking standup shows applying Pascoe\u2019s loveably nervy intelligence to pair bonding, Nietzschean philosophy, \u201csperm selection\u201d \u2013 all the big questions, in other words, and never a hack gag in sight. BL\n\n34\n\nTwenty years back, few had mime and clowning pegged as the hippest strands of 21st-century comedy. No one\u2019s played a greater role in their revival than Phil Burgers \u2013 AKA sexy clown-comic Dr Brown. A graduate \u2013 like so many of the saucer-eyed acts who followed \u2013 of Ecole Philippe Gaulier in Paris, Burgers developed an instant cult following with his silent, late-night shows: beautiful, skilful and playful, but also terrifying, in that Burgers displayed zero inhibitions and required his audiences to leave theirs at the door. An Edinburgh Comedy award followed; Burgers\u2019 influence is still being felt on live comedy. BL\n\n33\n\nA man with such comic gift he can make an HSBC advert watchable. Ayoade\u2019s dry-as-a-bone humour may be an acquired taste, but it hasn\u2019t stopped him piecing together a career of unusual breadth: as host of gadget and travel shows, a deft movie director, the droll voice of sanity in panel shows, author of two impeccably written books, and, perhaps most inspired of all, presenter of The Crystal Maze. His most straightforwardly comic role to date is as Moss the uber-geeky IT technician in The IT Crowd. The appearance of Ayoade in any show is a seal of quality. PF\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wunderkind ... Kevin Bridges. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\n32\n\nBridges was already marked out as a standup wunderkind before his brilliant debut show in 2009 aged 23. He\u2019s barely put a foot wrong since, and now rivals Michael McIntyre as Britain\u2019s finest exponent of that much-maligned form, observational comedy. What Bridges brings to it is a punchiness that never tips over into aggression, and an intelligence that steers him away from cheap shots and dumbed-down material. And best of all, he\u2019s a rare example of a mass-appeal standup who has the courage to be openly political, and the charm for it not to be divisive. PF\n\n31\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t want to be Amy Schumer. She releases a standup set (The Leather Special) and has to defend herself against rightwing trolls determined to reduce its Netflix rating. She releases a movie (I Feel Pretty) and has to defend herself against leftwing trolls who form a consensus about its message based purely on its trailer. This weight of expectation would crush most people, but not Schumer. This is probably because she is very, very funny. Watch Trainwreck, or Mostly Sex Stuff, or any episode of Inside Amy Schumer for proof. We\u2019re lucky to have her. SH\n\n30\n\nPut aside, if you can, his tabloid ubiquity and ropey oeuvre of Hollywood films. Turn a blind eye to his questionable role in the 2015 general election. Brand the cultural phenomenon isn\u2019t always a laughing matter, but Brand the comedian is harder to resist. On stage, where he can control how the narcissism, verbosity and new age philosophy come across \u2013 and where they\u2019re spliced with wit, self-mockery and a palpable love of people and life \u2013 Brand is a presence to conjure with, one of our most unique and charismatic comic talents. BL\n\n29\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Career of two halves ... Aziz Ansari. Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer\n\nAnsari has had a career of two halves. First, he was the playful standup whose routines revolved around clashing cultures and botched romances, a style translated into Netflix\u2019s Master of None. When allegations of sexual assault were made in 2018, it seemed his career might be over for good. He has denied claims, no charges were pressed, but Ansari is now tackling the subject in his work; a review described his new tour as \u201ca cry against extreme wokeness\u201d. Whether he can regain his former success remains to be seen, but he\u2019s determined to use comedy to make a statement. HJD\n\n28\n\nWhen Daniel Kitson won the 2002 Perrier award, breakout success seemed just a matter of time. But that\u2019s not what Kitson wanted. The Yorkshireman has since constructed the most respected bespoke career in comedy. He doesn\u2019t do telly, panel shows or media \u2013 yet his gigs (sometimes standup, sometimes plays, sometimes solo storytelling) often sell out far in advance. And his voice is among the most distinctive in comedy: barbed but romantic, blunt but lyrical, fiercely protective of humanity\u2019s fragile flame as the chill winds of soulless modernity billow around it. BL\n\n27\n\nWhen he was team captain on Mock the Week and best known for comparing a swimmer to a spoon, few would have nominated Frankie Boyle as one of the comics of the century. But that was before the Glaswegian\u2019s transformation into the most lacerating comic-critic of Tory Britain. On stage, in his newspaper columns, and on his terrific BBC show New World Order, Boyle has retained the brutality and joke-writing brilliance of his early work, but applied it to sociopolitics over celebrity. Boyle 2.0 is the appalling, apocalyptic comic-poet our end-of-days era demands. BL\n\n26\n\nMost assumed that The Daily Show would end when Jon Stewart quit in 2015. To all intents and purposes, the show was Stewart; intelligent, probing, angry and humane. So what do you do when you have to replace the voice of a generation? Easy, you find another one. Enter Trevor Noah. He\u2019s younger than Stewart, and much slicker, but his Daily Show has finally found its voice. Noah is such an outsider \u2013 not only a foreigner, but a South African born to interracial parents at the height of apartheid \u2013 that his point of view can\u2019t help but stand out against those of the white male Jimmys that make up the rest of late night TV. SH\n\n25\n\nWhen he played the O2 in London in 2013, on the back of the cult success of his autobiographical sitcom Louie, Louis CK was greeted as the world\u2019s best standup: a philosopher with great jokes, and a pitiless chronicler of the foibles of the midlife male. Then in 2017, several female comics alleged he had sexually harassed them. CK confessed, and withdrew from comedy \u2013 but not for long enough, say critics of his recent comeback. No one denies he delivered some brilliant standup in his pomp \u2013 but all those cynical gags about predatory maleness no longer sound quite so funny. BL\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bob Mortimer and Vic Reeves on Vic and Bob\u2019s Big Night Out. Photograph: BBC/Sophie Mutevelian\n\n24\n\nDespite reaching their anarchic zenith in the 90s, the pair segued into the 00s with hits such as Shooting Stars (which ran until 2011), lost classics such as Catterick and Vic and Bob\u2019s Afternoon Delights, as well as sitcoms (House of Fools) and reboots (Big Night Out). They\u2019ve also prospered independently and in the most surprising places \u2013 Bob\u2019s able to turn a panel show such as Would I Lie to You? into an odd Audience With performance. Between them they\u2019ve survived a triple heart bypass and a visit to the I\u2019m a Celebrity Jungle, to remain the reigning champions of surreal comedy. HG\n\n23\n\nGadsby\u2019s 2017 show, Nanette, was supposed to be her last before quitting comedy. An attack on homophobia and sexual violence, and an outpouring of pain and anger, Gadsby \u2013 a dry, modest comic from Tasmania \u2013 also turns her fire on standup itself, for giving the illusion of helping her mental health. Nanette was so bold, timely and devastatingly well written, that it\u2019s taken on a life of its own. A Netflix special was a huge hit, and she has, thank goodness, reversed her decision to quit the business. PF\n\n22\n\nFrom Ali G to Borat to Br\u00fcno, Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s audacious trolling and timely satire has made him one of comedy\u2019s best-known provocateurs. His style might not feel as edgy as it once was, and there have been some blips along the way (see 2012 film The Dictator). However, when he gets it right he can still make a huge impact, with latest series Who Is America? highlighting the ludicrousness of US politics. HJD\n\n21\n\nThe sadcom is the subgenre that takes the darker elements of the human condition \u2013 the ones previously reserved for standup \u2013 and fuses them with the tenets of TV comedy. Arguably, no comic has nailed this auteur trend better than Notaro, whose Amazon show One Mississippi focused on an annus horribilis that included the death of her mother, her cancer diagnosis and a breakup. In the wake of its (unpopular) cancellation, she brought her mix of deadpan and emotion to a Netflix special, Happy to Be Here, sealing her reputation as a pioneer of \u201ctraumedy\u201d. HJD\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Awkwardness ... Issa Rae in Insecure. Photograph: John P Fleenor/HBO\n\n20\n\nUS comic Rae harnessed the power of the webseries in the early 2010s, with her YouTube comedy The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl landing her a place on Forbes\u2019 30 Under 30 Entertainment List in 2012. While an early project with Shonda Rhimes was canned, Rae\u2019s star rose via her HBO series, Insecure. In a world still bound to tired stereotypes of alternately fierce and subjugated black women, this pop culture-heavy comedy stood out, as did the voice behind it, who plays the lead role with an understated confidence and, of course, lashings of awkwardness. HJD\n\n19\n\nThe criticism commonly levelled at mid-career Ricky Gervais (the arena standup; the outre awards host; the man who made and played Derek) is that he\u2019s turned into \u2013 or perhaps always was \u2013 his Office alter ego David Brent, forever tittering at how provocative he can be. Which at least goes to show what an unforgettable comic monster Brent was in the first place, a middle-management pipsqueak with delusions of charisma, fronting a pioneering cringe comedy and still-brilliant mockumentary nailing the pettiness and desolation of workplace life. BL\n\n18\n\nNo one with half a brain ever doubted that female could be funny. But feminism? Even Bridget Christie fought shy of the subject early in her career, when she stepped out as a daft sub-surrealist in disguise as Charles II. Or an ant. But then came A Bic for Her, her breakout 2013 set, a fantastically daft \u2013 yet fiercely committed \u2013 cri de coeur against everywhere sexism. Alongside the book, and the radio show, Christie has gone on to enjoy a brilliant career in campaigning comedy, and not only for feminist causes \u2013 sometimes it seems that there\u2019s nothing this terrific clown can\u2019t make funny. BL\n\n17\n\nRanganathan was on the brink of quitting comedy when he won the Leicester Mercury comedian of the year contest in 2013. Since then, the former maths teacher has done everything from presenting a travelogue with his mum (BBC3\u2019s Asian Provocateur) to making a sitcom based on the real-life story of inheriting his dad\u2019s pub (The Reluctant Landlord) to presenting a hip-hop podcast, as well as being a Mock the Week fixture. While he has stated that he doesn\u2019t do \u201cAsian comedy \u2026 I\u2019m just an Asian man who happens to be doing comedy\u201d, race features within a self-deprecating, off-kilter style.

Photograph: David Fisher/Rex Features\n\n16\n\nTo call someone \u201crandom\u201d may be slanderous in 2019, but when the Boosh arrived in the mid 00s with their hermaphroditic mermen, talking gorillas and giant lumps of evil bubblegum it was an illuminating antidote to the bleak mockumentary realism of the comedy that was booming at the time. Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt\u2019s Boosh radio series introduced listeners to the zooniverse of strange wonders, but their 2004 TV show was totally transportive: from its art school aesthetic to its dreamlike characters, it was as visually stimulating as a Jim Henson creation, or like stepping into a Frank Zappa album. HG\n\n15\n\nHis reputation has been damaged lately by some unpleasant material on gender \u2013 even if the 2017 Netflix specials in question went on to be the channel\u2019s most watched comedy specials of all time. But for years, you\u2019d have struggled to find a more authoritative standup worldwide than Dave Chappelle. Live performance aside, he entered the big league with Chappelle\u2019s Show, the trailblazing sketch series that made a whole new kind of merry with race, politics and pop culture. Its status \u2013 and Chappelle\u2019s no-compromise reputation \u2013 was secured when the star mysteriously quit the programme mid-recording in 2006, triggering a seven-year sabbatical from showbiz. BL\n\n14\n\nTo watch a Maria Bamford standup set is to sprint full-pelt to keep up with her train of thought. Other comedians might take the time to state and reinforce a premise before launching into their punchlines, but not Bamford. Her sets are a free-associated cavalcade of broken logic and weird voices, and it often takes full concentration just to figure out what\u2019s going on. Watch 2012\u2019s The Special Special Special! if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s Bamford performing standup for just her parents, and it is glorious. SH\n\n13\n\nPolitical views can kill a comedian\u2019s mojo (hello, Eddie Izzard). So what will happen to Sarah Silverman? Her early standup persona was a sort of narcissistic brat with no boundaries. Then she got politicised. Silverman\u2019s reaction to the rise of Donald Trump has been not just liberal rage, but attempts to reach out to his voters and understand them. Will this new-found earnestness kill her comedy mojo? It appears not. Her latest Netflix special, A Speck of Dust, shows she can inveigle her politics into her standup without compromising either. She\u2019s a remarkably gifted comic, with incredible control and courage \u2013 that she is still evolving makes her all the better. PF\n\n12\n\nFormer SNL cast member Amy Poehler got her big break as Pawnee\u2019s most enthusiastic public servant on Parks and Recreation. Poehler\u2019s hyperbolically feminist Leslie Knope pokes fun at lean-in culture, while also cementing the actor\u2019s reputation as a master of weirdo characters. It\u2019s a trend she continued as a mentor for Broad City\u2019s Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, helping to bring their show to TV and acting as its exec producer. HJD\n\n11\n\nMost SNL performers simply slope off when their time is up, but not Kristen Wiig. Her final episode, after seven years on the show, ended with a Lorne Michaels slow-dance as Mick Jagger sang Ruby Tuesday to her. By that point, of course, she\u2019d already written and starred in Bridesmaids \u2013 a hit so colossal that it tends to overshadow her other work. Stick a pin anywhere in her filmography, though, and you\u2019ll strike gold. Plus she\u2019s playing the baddie in Wonder Woman 1984, which is likely to vault her into the stratosphere. SH\n\n10\n\nHorgan has gone from portraying young drinking, shagging women (Pulling), to dysfunctional grown-up relationships (Catastrophe) to motherhood (Motherland) \u2013 and has nailed them all. Each show has been wickedly warts-and-all with almost documentary realism. Catastrophe remains the pick of the bunch, managing to be both funny and touching, and in Sharon and Rob she has created a comedy couple that will endure. PF\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Slippery ... Tim Key.\n\n9\n\nThe first half of this decade saw an extraordinary flowering of creative live comedy centred around north-London production house The Invisible Dot. Jonny Sweet, Claudia O\u2019Doherty and the stars of the Inbetweeners all made work here \u2013 but the flagship act was poet and performance-art comic Tim Key. Every Key show was an event, designed to upend \u2013 and expand \u2013 expectations of live comedy, and seduce us all with Key\u2019s coy and slippery humour. A role as Alan Partridge\u2019s sidekick gained Key wider recognition, but the live work is his indelible signature.

Everything Davis has written has been soaked in the worst excesses of human misery, but with a worrying degree of relatability, showing up the vulnerabilities of all of us. Human Remains was full of delusion. Nighty Night was a study of sociopathy. Hunderby exposed the dark guts of our period drama fetishisation. Camping felt like being drugged unconscious and dragged into the forest by woodspeople (or a clingy boyfriend). Her latest, Sally4Ever, is possibly her darkest yet. Even in the quaint format of the podcast \u2013 Dear Joan and Jericha \u2013 she manages malevolence. Inexplicably, she has not created a dud in her career. A spectacular achievement.

His most recent, Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999, is his best, and most personal, about a break-up that had a surprise showbiz angle. Acaster feels like an utterly uncompromised act: his shows can be elaborate metaphors and his stage presence has a sort of Dylan-ish prickliness \u2013 on TV panel shows he\u2019s the grit that cuts through the chumminess.

His first two standup specials since 2000, Never Scared and Kill the Messenger, are full of trademark Rock fury; but the third, last year\u2019s Tamborine, is quieter and more humane. Plus in this time he made Everybody Hates Chris, Top Five and The Motherfucker With the Hat. That Chris Rock is one of the funniest people alive goes without saying. The scary thing is that, after 30 years in the business, he might actually be getting better. SH\n\n2\n\nYes, there is Alan Partridge \u2013 a character of such magnitude that lesser comedians would have given up at that. But in addition, Steve Coogan has starred in three series of The Trip, seamlessly blending travelogue, impression show and gloomy indie drama into a brave new form all of its own. His film work has lurched from critically celebrated highbrow comedy (24 Hour Party People, A Cock and Bull Story) to hugely underrated would-be blockbusters (Hamlet 2, Around the World in 80 Days). And he\u2019s Alan bloody Partridge, for crying out loud. Surely that\u2019s enough by itself. SH\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Powerhouse \u2026 Tina Fey Photograph: Chris Pizzello/AP\n\n1\n\nTina Fey is having quite the busy century. In 1999 she became Saturday Night Live\u2019s first female head writer, winning the show its first best writing Emmy for 13 years in the process. In 2004 she wrote Mean Girls. From 2006 to 2013 she wrote and starred in 30 Rock, winning 112 Emmy nominations along the way. In 2011 she was paid $6m to write Bossypants, opening the floodgates for dozens of essay collections by female comedians. She co-created Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. She executive-produced Great News, one of the best lost sitcoms of our age. She has rapped with Childish Gambino. She performs the definitive Sarah Palin impersonation. She is one of the very few non-obnoxious people ever to host the Golden Globes. And she isn\u2019t slowing down, either; her new NBC sitcom \u2013 in which Ted Danson will play an obnoxious mayor of Los Angeles \u2013 sounds like it\u2019s going to be a slam-dunk, and she\u2019ll soon star in what\u2019s likely to be the most successful film of her life in Pixar\u2019s Soul. She remains precisely as exacting, hilarious and influential as she\u2019s ever been. Remove any of her projects from your life, with the possible exception of Wine Country, and the world immediately becomes a much worse place. A true legend.
