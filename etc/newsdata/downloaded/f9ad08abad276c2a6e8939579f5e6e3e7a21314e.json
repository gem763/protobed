I can remember the variety of butterflies, their miraculous beauty, strength and fragility \u2013 I miss them in the visceral way I miss members of my family long since dead.\u2019\n\nThe 60-year-old Love Actually and Nanny McPhee star provoked ridicule in May this year when The Mail on Sunday revealed she had taken a first-class flight from Heathrow to New York after joining Extinction Rebellion campaigners in London and urging people to fly less. In the book, she writes: \u2018All humans know somewhere deep \u2013 somewhere like our spinal cords, somewhere we are not used to communicating with \u2013 that our planet is suffering.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like being in a sci-fi story where we are under attack from the Martians \u2013 except in this story we are the Martians and there is no spaceship out there poised to save us from destruction.\u2019\n\nOscar-winner Dame Emma says: \u2018I can remember how many bees I used to see in parks and gardens in London and on the hills of Argyll. I can remember the variety of butterflies, their miraculous beauty, strength and fragility \u2013 I miss them in the visceral way I miss members of my family long since dead\u2019 (stock image)\n\nDame Emma also talks about the difficulty of reducing humanity\u2019s addictions to scientific innovations and inventions which she says once seemed \u2018miraculous\u2019 but are now \u2018agents of destruction\u2019.\n\nShe writes: \u2018It\u2019s hard to let go of our addictions, so hard. But let go we must if we, and the greater web of life of which we are, after all, only a part, are to survive.\u2019\n\nAnother contribution comes from actor Sir Mark Rylance, who quit the Royal Shakespeare Company earlier this year in protest at its sponsorship deal with oil giant BP. He writes about light pollution after a trip rafting down the Colorado River in America.\n\nThe new book also includes the lyrics to Yoko Ono\u2019s song I Love You, Earth in which the star repeatedly proclaims her affection for the planet and its wonders.", "description": "Dame Emma makes the  revelation in a new book called Letters To The Earth.
