This dropped to \u00a398,300 in 2017, after adjusting for inflation and the fewer number of sessions worked.\n\nGPs are earning 14 per cent less than they were in 2008 amid a nationwide shortage of family doctors, a study by University of Manchester has revealed\n\nThe NHS has lost almost 700 GPs in the past three years, figures from NHS Digital show.\n\nA team from University of Manchester analysed surveys taken by doctors between 2007 and 2017.\n\nUp to 1,300 doctors filled in the questionnaire each year. Almost all respondents (96 per cent) reported their income.\n\nNational statistics show the average GP income has been fairly stable over the last decade, despite changes to the economy.\n\nStudy author Rose Atkins and colleagues found that, after adjusting for inflation, the average GPs income decreased by 12.5 per cent.\n\nThe biggest drops in income were recorded by partnered GPs, who are the highest earners because they are a 'partner' in their GP practice.\n\nThey saw a drop of 15.1 per cent over the decade, from \u00a3115,911 in 2008 to \u00a398,373 in 2017.\n\nWHY ARE GPS IN SHORTFALL? Pressures on GP services are higher than ever. Since 2013 the number of people living in the UK has soared from 64million in 2013 to nearly 67million. But the number of GPs has not kept pace. Experts have said the dwindling number highlighted a 'crisis' in doctors' surgeries and that GPs were under 'tremendous pressure' and 'fighting a losing battle'. Fewer young doctors are choosing to specialise as GPs, and are opting for more \u2018macho\u2019 career paths as surgeons or specialists. Numbers of GPs are known to be dwindling in recent years, placing even more pressure on an over-stretched health service. Many are retiring in their 50s, moving abroad or leaving to work in the private sector, as practices have threatened to close their waiting lists until action is taken. This continued crisis has left many patients at risk, with staff unable to cope with the rising demand and slashed funding. The British Medical Association (BMA) has warned that unless the NHS pension taxation scheme was reformed, more doctors would be lost. Concerns about high-earning doctors\u2019 pensions were raised in 2016. Doctors who earn more than \u00a3110,000 a year enter a 'taper zone' which triggers big tax bills. The shortage of doctors comes despite the NHS adopting a plan to recruit 5,000 extra GPs by 2021. Meanwhile, a record 138 GP surgeries shut down last year, closing at a rate of more than two a week, affecting more than 500,000 patients. As recently as 2013, just 18 surgeries shut across the UK. By last year that number had increased nearly eight-fold.\n\nSalaried GPs, who have a fixed salary, saw a ten per cent decrease from \u00a357,189 in 2008 to \u00a351,208 in 2017.\n\nThe recommended minimum annual salary for a full-time salaried GP in England, under the range set by the Doctors and Dentists Review Body, is \u00a357,655.\n\nThe researchers, whose findings were published in the British Journal of General Practice, also took the number of shifts worked into consideration.\n\nThe average number of shifts worked by GP partners decreased from 7.7 to seven per week, and 5.6 to 5.3 for salaried doctors.\n\nIncome adjusted for shifts worked and inflation dropped by ten per cent for partner GPs and seven per cent for salaried GPs, between 2008 and 2017.\n\nThe team concluded: 'The decrease in GP income adjusted for sessions worked and inflation over the last decade may have contributed to the current problems with recruitment and retention.'\n\nBritish GPs are among the highest paid in the world, earning up to four times as much as the national average salary of \u00a326,000.\n\nBut they haven't had a significant pay rise since 2004, when a GP contract was negotiated by the last Labour Government.\n\nThe NHS has lost almost 600 GPs in the last year - in June 2019 there were 28,257 GPs working in England, two per cent below the figure a year earlier.\n\nAlmost as many family doctors left the health service between June 2018 and June 2019 as did in the entire three years to March, according to NHS figures.\n\nIn England an ambition was set in 2016 to hire 5,000 more GPs by 2020 \u2013 but this target, pledged by Jeremy Hunt, seems likely to be missed.\n\nHealth secretary Matt Hancock pledged earlier this year to set a new deadline, but it has not been confirmed.\n\nA report by think tanks suggested the shortfall in GPs could grow by around 4,500 in five years unless urgent action is taken.\n\nDwindling number of GPs is placing even more pressure on an over-stretched health service.\n\nMany are retiring in their 50s, moving abroad or leaving to work in the private sector, as practices have threatened to close their waiting lists until action is taken.\n\nThis continued crisis has left many patients at risk, with staff unable to cope with the rising demand and slashed funding.\n\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) has warned unless the NHS pension taxation scheme was reformed, more doctors would be lost.\n\nDubbed the 'tax trap', big bills linked to the value of a doctors pension has been blamed for deterring staff from taking on overtime.", "description": "University of Manchester analysed data from surveys\u00a0collected every two years.
