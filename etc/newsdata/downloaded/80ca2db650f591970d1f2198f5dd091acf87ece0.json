REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage\n\n(Reuters) - PG&E Corp (PCG.N) rejected a $2.5 billion offer from San Francisco to buy the bankrupt Californian company\u2019s power lines and other infrastructure within the city, calling the offer inadequate.\n\nThe offer significantly undervalued the assets and a deal would not be in the best interest of the company\u2019s customers, PG&E\u2019s chief executive officer, Bill Johnson, wrote in a letter to San Francisco Mayor London Breed and City Attorney Dennis Herrera.\n\nThe company\u2019s financing strategy to emerge from bankruptcy did not include selling off company assets, Johnson said in the letter, which was dated Oct. 7.\n\n\u201cAlthough we cannot accept your offer, we want to clearly communicate that PG&E intends to continue working with the City to best serve the citizens and businesses of San Francisco,\u201d Johnson wrote.\n\nSan Francisco had made the offer in September, eight months after the utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nBreed and Herrera responded on Friday by saying that San Francisco would continue to pursue the acquisition of PG&E\u2019s electrical assets. They said in a statement that arguments made by the company on the proposal were \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the comprehensive analysis done by the city and its financial advisers.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t surprised by PG&E\u2019s response so far,\u201d the two officials said. \u201cWe\u2019re also not giving up. Now more than ever, it is clear that we must take back control of San Francisco\u2019s electric service and achieve energy independence.\u201d", "description": "PG&E Corp rejected a $2.5 billion offer from San Francisco to buy the bankrupt Californian company's power lines and other infrastructure within the city, calling the offer inadequate.", "authors": ["Shanti S Nair", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439865600&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A281", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
