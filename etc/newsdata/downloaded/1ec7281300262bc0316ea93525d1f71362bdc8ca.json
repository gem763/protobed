Benedict College Spokeswoman Kymm Hunter reportedly told the White House press pool that only seven students attended the speech, and CNN reports that Columbia\u2019s Mayor Stephen Benjamin said the White House chose who else attended.\n\n\u201cThis should have been an opportunity for at least scores of students to attend this event,\u201d Benjamin reportedly said to CNN.\n\nHunter said in a statement to The State that asking students to remain in their dorms was part of a safety plan the school made in conjunction with the Secret Service and that classes were canceled.\n\n\u201cThe campus was closed and streets surrounding the campus were shut down to all vehicle traffic from 1:30 p.m.-3:00 p.m. Faculty, staff and student who were on campus were asked to stay inside, but if anyone needed to go to work or to another building, it was not problem,\u201d Hunter reportedly said in the statement.\n\nHunter did not respond immediately to comment.\n\nNia Byas, a 20-year-old sophomore at Benedict College, tells that TIME that students were asked not to leave their dorms from 12 to 4. Byas chose to protest the speech.\n\n\u201cI protested for all historically black institutions. My goal was to make my voice be heard that I don\u2019t want Donald Trump visiting any historically black colleges, especially my campus,\u201d she tells TIME.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech kicked off the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum, a bipartisan criminal justice forum intended to help build upon the progress of the First Step Act passed in 2018. According to the forum\u2019s event page, all presidential candidates were invited and many Democratic candidates will speak this weekend. On Friday, California Sen. Kamala Harris said she would protest the forum because the President received an award for criminal justice.\n\nI won't be complicit in papering over Trump's record. pic.twitter.com/eF27XpaRZy \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 26, 2019\n\nIn his speech, Trump spoke about the need for criminal justice reform, and also mocked the Obama administration and said that Trump administration has made more progress for African Americans than \u201cin the history of our country.\u201d\n\nProtests formed outside the auditorium as the President delivered his speech on Friday.\n\nProtesters march through the streets of Columbia, SC ahead of the president\u2019s criminal justice speech here at Benedict College. pic.twitter.com/NpiouNNljS \u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) October 25, 2019\n\nReporters in the area highlighted some of the students protesting.\n\n\u201cAs an African American, I feel very unsafe.\u201d She is a freshman at Benedict College and said students were asked not to leave their dorm rooms between 1pm-4pm. @wachfox pic.twitter.com/1ogtxIFAsG \u2014 Sooji Nam (@sooji_namtv) October 25, 2019\n\nBenedict sophomore Nia Byas said she thought it is \"inappropriate\" for Trump to visit a historically black college. \"I feel like he is just here to antagonize us.\" pic.twitter.com/QjgpVw0TRO \u2014 Emily Bohatch (@emilybohatch) October 25, 2019\n\nTwo Benedict College students say an announcement was made by the school\u2019s president stating students weren\u2019t allowed to leave campus until 3 or 4 pm during #Trump\u2019s visit today for their safety. #TrumpInColumbia pic.twitter.com/CRFHQMKi89 \u2014 The State Newspaper (@thestate) October 25, 2019\n\nOthers associated with Benedict College expressed frustration on Twitter.\n\nAs a former employee of Benedict College, I think Donald Trump being allowed on that campus after the hateful rhetoric he's spewed for years is an administrative failure. HBCUS are our sanctuaries from hate. You don't invite the Klan to dinner! \u2014 Aisha K.
