The profiles in courage belong to Reps. Susan Brooks of Indiana, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Fred Upton of Michigan, and Will Hurd of Texas. (That\u2019s not counting Michigan\u2019s Justin Amash, who left the GOP on July 4 of this year and also voted for the resolution).\n\nBy voting to condemn a president of their own political party, the four demonstrated bravery, decency, and intellectual honesty.\n\nWhile many Americans will appreciate this willingness to stand athwart Trumpism, yelling \u201cstop!\u201d I suspect not everyone will fully appreciate this sacrifice. It is good to be reminded that it\u2019s not so easy to stand against one\u2019s own party. Just a few months ago. Democrats had the chance to issue a clear resolution condemning Rep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s anti-Semitic rhetoric. That resolution passed only after it was revised and weakened to the point of being meaningless. It\u2019s easy to say the other guys (or ladies) should do the right thing. It\u2019s much tougher when it\u2019s your party.\n\nThis is not to change the subject from Trump\u2019s indefensible comments. Some on the right engaged in a semantics debate over whether or not his words fit some textbook definition of \u201cracism,\u201d but his comments were indefensible no matter what label you put on them. The correct vote was to support the resolution condemning his \u201cracist comments that have legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\u201d\n\nShould we be sad that only four Republicans agree with that, or happy that there are four brave Republicans willing to take a stand? I\u2019m a glass-is-half-full type of guy. This is partly because I\u2019ve have been conditioned for low expectations of Republicans, but there\u2019s more.\n\nStanding up to Donald Trump, for Republicans, at least, is a demonstrably thankless endeavor. It\u2019s hard to think of an example where it ended terribly well, and there are lots of examples where it ended badly (see Jeff Flake and Bob Corker). What does seem to work is acquiescing. Just ask Lindsey Graham.\n\nThis is because the rank-and-file Republican base is with him. It\u2019s hard to ask elected Republicans to defy their constituents\u2014their voters\u2014which is precisely what we consistently do when we ask them to stand up to Trump. Again, it\u2019s easy to say that leaders ought to do the right thing. In practice, though, human nature is to take the easy way out.\n\nI realize Tuesday\u2019s vote doesn\u2019t change much. Just as their votes were a necessary, but not sufficient, repudiation of their party\u2019s president, so is this column praising the Republicans who cast those votes. Because, come tomorrow, there very well may be reprisals.\n\nBut while it might be only a symbolic sign of a respectable conservative remnant, these leaders provide a glimmer of hope that someday the party of Lincoln and Reagan will once again rekindle. Once the light is fully extinguished, it is harder to imagine a rebirth. For today, at least, I\u2019d rather light a candle than curse the darkness.", "description": "Few party members have been rewarded for standing up to Trump.
