Daniel Leal-Olivas/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nThe Mail on Sunday newspaper reported that Johnson said he would find a way to circumvent a recent parliament vote ordering him to delay Brexit rather than take Britain out of the EU without a transition deal.\n\n\u201cThe madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,\u201d Johnson was quoted as saying. \u201cHulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be - and that is the case for this country. We will come out on October 31.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s parliament has repeatedly rejected the exit deal Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May negotiated with the EU, and this month rejected leaving without a deal - angering many Britons who voted to leave the bloc more than three years ago.\n\nJohnson wants to harness that anger to win a majority in an early national election, but his efforts to call one have so far been thwarted by opposition parties who want to first ensure Britain cannot leave the EU without a deal on Oct. 31.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats party, which has 18 seats in Britain\u2019s 650-seat parliament, on Sunday made its bid for the votes of those who want remain in the EU, toughening its anti-Brexit stance to say it would stop the exit process if it won power in an election, and would reject any Brexit deal Johnson struck.\n\n\u201cIf people put into government as a majority government, the \u2018Stop Brexit\u2019 party, then stopping Brexit is exactly what people will get,\u201d party leader Jo Swinson said.\n\nHUGE PROGRESS\n\nJohnson has said he wants to negotiate a new deal that does not involve a \u2018backstop\u2019, which would potentially tie Britain against its will to EU rules after it leaves in order to avoid checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe EU has so far insisted on the backstop, and Britain has not presented any detailed alternative.\n\nNonetheless, Johnson said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very, very good conversation going on about how to address the issues of the Northern Irish border. A huge amount of progress is being made,\u201d Johnson told the Mail on Sunday, without giving details.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party called for more details on what Johnson was proposing.\n\nJohnson drew parallels between Britain\u2019s situation in Brexit talks and the frustrations felt by fictional scientist Bruce Banner, who when enraged turned into the super-strong Incredible Hulk, frequently leaving behind a trail of destruction.\n\n\u201cBanner might be bound in manacles, but when provoked he would explode out of them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Sunday Times reported that Johnson\u2019s senior adviser Dominic Cummings had raised the idea of suspending parliament for a second time. Parliament is currently suspended until Oct. 14 - a decision which is being challenged in the courts by those who say it is an attempt to block debate on Brexit.\n\nSTOP BREXIT PARTY\n\nOn Saturday, former Conservative minister Sam Gyimah said he was switching to the pro-EU Liberal Democrat party in protest at Johnson\u2019s Brexit policies and political style, and Swinson said she believed she could win an election.\n\nBut, polling suggests the Liberal Democrats, who in the party\u2019s modern form have never won more than 62 seats at an election, are unlikely to find themselves in a position to stop Brexit outright.\n\nPolls published late on Saturday painted a conflicting picture of the Conservative Party\u2019s political fortunes under Johnson.\n\nA poll conducted by Opinium for the Observer newspaper showed Conservative support rose to 37% from 35% over the past week, while Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour held at 25% and Liberal Democrat support dropped to 16% from 17%. Support for Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party remained at 13%.\n\nHowever, a separate poll by ComRes for the Sunday Express put Conservative support at just 28%, down from 30% and only a shade ahead of Labour at 27%.\n\nComRes said just 12% of the more than 2,000 people it survey thought Britain\u2019s parliament could be trusted to do the right thing for the country.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson likened himself to the comic book character The Incredible Hulk in a newspaper interview where he stressed his determination to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1429945469&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0RI", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
