REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nWith lawmakers in the U.S. Congress moving to impose sanctions of their own, Trump announced he would soon issue an executive order authorizing sanctions against current and former officials of the Turkish government for contributing to Turkey\u2019s military operation in northern Syria.\n\nIn a statement, Trump said he had increased tariffs on imports of Turkish steel back up to 50 percent, six months after they were reduced, and would immediately stop negotiations on what he called a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Turkey does not appear to be mitigating the humanitarian effects of its invasion,\u201d said Trump.\n\nTurkey launched a cross-border operation into northern Syria a week ago after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told Trump in a phone call he planned to move ahead with a long-planned move against America\u2019s Kurdish allies in the region.\n\nTrump abruptly announced a redeployment of 50 American troops from the conflict zone to get them out of harm\u2019s way, dismissing criticism that this would leave the Kurds open to attack. This was widely seen as giving Erdogan a green light for his operation.\n\nThe resulting scenes of carnage have exposed Trump to harsh criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike for abandoning the Kurdish allies who were instrumental in the U.S. battle against Islamic State militants in Syria.\n\nAs Congress has vowed to act if he will not, Trump said Turkey\u2019s action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and \u201csetting conditions for possible war crimes\u201d but he made clear he had no plans to reverse his decision to withdraw.\n\n\u201cAs I have said, I am withdrawing the remaining United States service members from northeast Syria,\u201d said Trump.\n\nU.S. troops coming out of Syria will stay in the region to monitor ISIS and a small footprint will remain at the Tanf base in southern Syria, he said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican allied with Trump, expressed his displeasure in a statement.\n\n\u201cAbandoning this fight now and withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria would recreate the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,\u201d he said.\n\nA statement from Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic senators Robert Menendez and Jack Reed said the only person who is able to \u201cimmediately stop this tragedy unfolding is the president himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first step when Congress returns to session this week is for Republicans to join with us in passing a resolution making clear that both parties are demanding the president\u2019s decision be reversed,\u201d they said.\n\nTrump said his executive order would enable the United States to impose sanctions on those current or former Turkish officials who may be involved in human rights abuses. He said it will authorize sanctions such as blocking of property and barring entry into the United States.\n\nTurkey\u2019s lira, which had weakened some 0.8% in the day, reacted minimally to Trump\u2019s announcement. It stood at 5.9300 at 2018 GMT, from 5.9260 beforehand.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday raised steel tariffs on Turkey and threatened more sanctions over its incursion into Syria as Trump scrambled to limit the damage from his much-criticized decision to clear U.S. troops from Turkey's path.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Humeyra Pamuk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440856265&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1PU-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
