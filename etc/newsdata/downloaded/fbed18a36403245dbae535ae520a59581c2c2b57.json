He has been released from prison but remains under house arrest, facing terrorism and espionage charges, which he vehemently denies. His detention is a further point of contention with Erdo\u011fan \u2014 with whom Trump had personally been friendly despite his increasingly authoritarian behavior.", "description": "Brunson was detained after the 2016 failed coup against Turkey's president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/aiH6q4uAlXQ2CIpISoSskD_LauE=/0x540:5184x3456/1920x1080/2018/08/02/1533168627941.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-02"}
