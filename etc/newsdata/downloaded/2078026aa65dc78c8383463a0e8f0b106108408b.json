Nothing in Cuba presents a threat to the United States. There\u2019s no likelihood that the Soviets or Cubans would try and install an offensive capability in Cuba,\" said a sneering National Security Advisor, McGeorge Bundy, on ABC\u2019s Issues and Answers, Oct. 14, 1962.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s fifty-odd-thousand Cuban refugees in this country, all living for the day when we go to war with Cuba. They\u2019re the ones putting out this kind of stuff (about missiles),\u201d said a sneering President John F. Kennedy on Oct. 15th, 1962.\n\n\u201cThe USSR could derive considerable military advantage from the establishment of medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles in Cuba. But this would be incompatible with Soviet practice to date and with Soviet policy as we presently estimate it,\" noted a CIA report, Sept 19, 1962.\n\n(All quotes above meticulously documented in this internationally-acclaimed book)\n\nFor months prior to Kennedy and Bundy\u2019s sneering against the Cuban missile-mongers, dozens of young Cuban exiles had been risking their lives by infiltrating Cuba and bringing out eyewitness reports of what remains the biggest military threat to the U.S. in its history. In the process, some of these Cuban boys were also dying by firing squad and torture at the hands of Castro and Che Guevara\u2019s KGB-tutored secret police.\n\nOutrageously, many of these young Cubans had been working for the CIA itself when they infiltrated Cuba at enormous risk to their lives. But their eye-witness reports of missiles were pooh-poohed by the CIA\u2019s mostly Ivy-League-pedigreed and Washington-based \u201csuits.\u201d After all, these Cubans had an \u201caxe-to-grind.\u201d So their reports were no more credible to the CIA\u2019s ultra-educated and ultra-sophisticated Washington-based \u201canalysts\u201d than the ones from other deplorable \u201caxe-grinding\u201d Cubans a few years earlier. To wit:\n\n\u201cThe Cuban SIM (Servicio de Inteligencia Militar) report is nothing more than a summary of allegations made against Fidel Castro\u2026this summary has been slanted in an effort to make Castro a \u201cRojo\u201d (Red) but the result is a rather poor one...Castro is definitely not a communist \u2026 the U.S. should not be taken in by President Fulgencio Batista\u2019s attempt to label the revolutionary movement as communist inspired, dominated or influenced.\u201d -CIA report from Havana station, Nov. 1958.\n\nAt any rate, exactly 24 hours after President Kennedy\u2019s sneer against those deplorable \u201crumor-mongering\u201d Cuban exiles, U-2 photos sat on his desk showing those \"refugee rumors,\" pointed directly at Bundy, JFK, and their entire staff of Ivy League-credentialed national security wizards.\n\n\u201cOK, Humberto,\u201d some amigos retort. \u201cBut then JFK quickly took the bull by the horns! He showed those Russkies who was boss! He stood up to them and Khrushchev retreated with his tail between his legs! That\u2019s what Democrats used to do!\u201d\n\nHAH! What a joke. In fact:\n\n\"We ended up getting exactly what we'd wanted all along,\" snickered Nikita Khrushchev in his diaries, \u201csecurity for Fidel Castro\u2019s regime and American missiles removed from Turkey and Italy. Until today the U.S. has complied with her promise not to interfere with Castro and not to allow anyone else to interfere with Castro. After Kennedy's death, his successor Lyndon Johnson assured us that he would keep the promise not to invade Cuba.\"\n\nIn his diaries Khrushchev snickers further: \"it would have been ridiculous for us to go to war over Cuba\u2013for a country 8,000 miles away. For us, war was unthinkable.\" So much for the threat that so rattled the Knights of Camelot and inspired such cinematic and literary epics of drama and derring-do by their court scribes and court cinematographers.\n\nIn fact Khrushchev prepared to yank the missiles before any \u201cbullying\u201d by Kennedy. \u201cWhat!\u201d Khrushchev gasped on Oct. 28th 1962, as recalled by his son Sergei. \u201cIs he (Fidel Castro) proposing that we start a nuclear war? But that is insane!...Remove them (our missiles) as soon as possible! Before it\u2019s too late. Before something terrible happens!\u201d commanded the Soviet premier.\n\nSo much for the gallant Knights of Camelot forcing the Russians\u2019 retreat. In fact, the Castro brothers and Che Guevara\u2019s genocidal lust is what prompted the Butcher of Budapest to yank the missiles from their reach.\n\nConsidering the U.S. nuclear superiority over the Soviets at the time of the (so-called) Missile Crisis (five thousand nuclear warheads for us, three hundred for them) it's hard to imagine a President Nixon \u2014 much less Reagan \u2014 quaking in front of Khrushchev's transparent ruse a la Kennedy.\n\nThe genuine threat came --not from Moscow\u2014but from the Castros and Che. \u201cIf the missiles had remained, we would have fired them against the very heart of the U.S., including New York. The victory of socialism is well worth millions of atomic victims.\u201d (Che Guevara, Nov. 1962.)\n\nIn fact, here was the consensus at the time from America\u2019s military chiefs and most prominent Republicans:\n\n\u201cThe biggest defeat in our nation\u2019s history!\u201d (Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Curtis Lemay.)\n\n\u201cWe missed the big boat,\u201d (Gen. Maxwell Taylor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been had!\u201d (Navy Chief of Staff George Anderson.)\n\n\"It\u2019s a public relations fable that Khrushchev quailed before Kennedy. The Kennedy-Khrushchev deal was a deplorable error resulting in political havoc and human suffering through the America\u2019s.\u201d -Gen. Alexander Haig\n\n\u201cWe locked Castro\u2019s communism into Latin America and threw away the key to its removal!\u201d -Barry Goldwater\n\n\u201cKennedy pulled defeat out of the jaws of victory and gave the Soviets squatter\u2019s rights in our backyard!\u201d -Richard Nixon.\n\n(All quotes above meticulously documented here.)\n\nWilliam Buckley's National Review devoted several issues to exposing and denouncing Kennedy's appeasement. The magazine's popular \"The Third World War\" column by James Burnham roundly condemned Kennedy's Missile Crisis solution as \"America's Defeat.\"\n\nCastro's regime's was granted new status. Let's call it MAP, or Mutually-Assured-Protection. Cuban freedom-fighters working from south Florida were suddenly rounded up for \"violating U.S. Neutrality laws.\" Some of these bewildered men were jailed, others \"quarantined,\" prevented from leaving Dade County. The Coast Guard in Florida got 12 new boats and seven new planes to make sure Castro remained unmolested.\n\nIt's a tribute to the power of Castroite mythology that, even with all this information a matter of public record for almost half a century the academic/Fake News Media mantra (gloat, actually) still has Castro, \"defying ten U.S. Presidents!\"\n\nCan we talk? Instead, he\u2019d been protected by them.\n\n\n\n", "description": "[These missiles in Cuba are] \u201cnothing but refugee rumors.
