So maybe, some of the executives reasoned, Phillips\u2019s origin story could set up a character who audiences would understand is based on the Joker, but who isn\u2019t literally the Joker. Couldn\u2019t he be some kind of peripheral figure instead? The idea divided the studio chieftains, but everyone agreed transposing the actual Joker from his more familiar context as the Dark Knight\u2019s most infamous antagonist and placing him on his own within a mash-up of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy was a risky move. Then there was the question of how it would resonate with DC Extended Universe fans, accustomed to straight-down-the-pike comics adaptations like Aquaman and Wonder Woman.\n\nIn the end, of course, the Joker did not dance down the stairs and out of his own namesake motion picture. Over the weekend \u2014 Joker\u2019s fourth in theaters \u2014 the $55 million, Joaquin Phoenix-starring criminal character study claimed the No. 1 spot at the box office for the second time, taking in $18.9 million domestically to become the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. With its cumulative worldwide haul of $849 million, Joker handily toppled the record of $785 million previously set by the comedy-thriller Deadpool 2. And now, with the passing of fears that Joker would inspire an incel uprising or in-theater active-shooter gun violence \u2014 and amid a swarm of awards buzz for Phoenix\u2019s deliberately bonkers performance \u2014 the superhero-adjacent drama appears poised to break $900 million at the global box office.\n\nJoker\u2019s splashy arrival in the movie marketplace as something more akin to a singular cultural event than another superhero spinoff can be attributed to a combination of factors beyond Phillips\u2019s absolute unwillingness to make anything but a Joker movie. In the fall of 2018, with principal photography on Joker still in progress, Rich (who replaced Kroll last January) settled on a very specific promotional strategy. The film (which was co-financed by Village Roadshow and the Canadian production company Bron Studios) would be released in the fall movie corridor, a time of year typically associated with serious adult fare, not popcorn comic-book movies. And in an early bid to distinguish it within the superhero genre, Warner\u2019s marketing and distribution executives strategized to premiere Joker at a prestigious European film festival.\n\nIt helped that a spot on the upcoming summer-release calendar had opened up, allowing Warner Bros.\u2019 previously scheduled fall DC Universe movie, Wonder Woman: 1984, to move from a November roll-out to a potentially more lucrative June 2020 theatrical release. Joker was accepted at both the Venice and Toronto International Film Festivals. Instead of walking away from its titular character, Warner Bros. was walking away from the typical comic-book movie playbook.\n\nBut according to various people close to the project, the fuse that lit fan excitement for Joker can be carbon dated to Sept. 21, 2018, more than a year before it would premiere to an eight-minute standing ovation in Italy. That day on his Instagram account, Phillips posted camera test footage of Phoenix in character \u2014 first as the sad-sack aspiring comedian Arthur Flack, then later in smeary Joker makeup and full clown regalia \u2014 backdropped by the Guess Who\u2019s 1969 single \u201cLaughing.\u201d It prompted a collective gasp across the internet. The 30-second clip made clear that Phoenix\u2019s gaunt interpretation of the character was tonally separate and distinct from previous Joker movie performances by Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Jared Leto (who reportedly lobbied the studio to prevent the director from filming Joker and fired his agents when the project moved forward).\n\nSubsequent trailers for the film emphasized its edgy cool \u2014 placing Joker on a dramatic continuum much closer to \u201970s crime dramas like Serpico or Dog Day Afternoon than, say, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. And further signaling Joker\u2019s seriousness of artistic intent, Warner\u2019s marketers opted not to release any product tie-ins or Happy Meal\u2013style toy promotional agreements that normally supply additional revenue streams for comic-book adaptations.\n\nFinally, in the weeks leading up to Joker\u2019s Oct. 4 release, the conversation surrounding the film became increasingly alarmist. At a time when mass shootings have become frighteningly constant, some critics questioned the effect of releasing a major studio film focused on a disaffected loner who is liberated by hate and emerges as an icon only after arming himself. But just as discussion of Joker\u2019s potential to inspire Aurora, Colorado\u2013style domestic terrorism threatened to overtake its buzz, the studio began limiting Phillips\u2019s and Phoenix\u2019s exposure to the press. Warner Bros. took the unusual step of canceling all red-carpet interviews with reporters at the movie\u2019s New York and Los Angeles premieres. From there, sources say, the film relied on the already-captured attention of fans still aching for the IP to set box-office records.\n\nSo now that Joker has split the atom for R-rated, superhero-inspired crime drama, should moviegoers expect to see the multiplex glutted with similarly lugubrious, comic-book related, mid-budget movies? Not necessarily so, says one of our sources, who points out that after Deadpool 2 set the previous R-rated box-office record, precisely zero other ultraviolent, hyperprofane comic-book-adapted thrillers were green-lighted by Hollywood studios. Although a Joker sequel is not entirely out of the question. \u201cYou don\u2019t see people hankering for a solo movie about the Penguin,\u201d Erik Davis, managing editor of Fandango, points out. \u201cBut Joker is just a character who has always piqued people\u2019s interest. He has been portrayed in the comics over the years in so many different ways, with so many different backstories, and so there are all these different avenues that they can go down when it comes to exploring this character.\u201d", "description": "Joker\u2019s Unlikely Path to Becoming the Highest-Grossing R-Rated Movie Ever.
