Anyway, Phoebe Waller-Bridge has signed a big overall deal with Amazon Studios that, according to Variety, is worth \u201caround $20 million a year,\u201d and means she\u2019ll be creating and producing a bunch of new TV that will premiere exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. \u201cI\u2019m insanely excited to be continuing my relationship with Amazon,\u201d Waller-Bridge said in a statement. \u201cWorking with the team on Fleabag was the creative partnership dreams are made of. It really feels like home. I can\u2019t wait to get going!\u201d In addition to Fleabag, Waller-Bridge created BBC America\u2019s Killing Eve, has the series Run coming to HBO, and did some work on the next Bond script. In a Hollywood Reporter profile back in August, Waller-Bridge said of overall deals that \u201cyou can smell it a mile off when people are just saying, \u2018We want to pay for your name,\u2019 to be associated with their company and then have their own agenda\u201d and that she didn\u2019t trust that, but admitted there is certainly \u201can appeal in not having to meet new people all the time.\u201d There is also certainly an appeal in $20 million a year, and on our end, in the idea that, if we\u2019re definitely not getting more Fleabag, we\u2019re getting some other Waller-Bridge ideas soon.", "description": "Phoebe Waller-Bridge has signed a big overall deal with Amazon to make TV for them exclusively estimated to be about $20 million a year.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/24-phoebe-waller-bridge.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
