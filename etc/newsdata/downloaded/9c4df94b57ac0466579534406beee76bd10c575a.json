He knows how to bowl on (these) pitches, gets reverse swing straight into play once he knows there is some help on offer,\" said Rohit Sharma, named man of the match for hitting two centuries in the game, which was his first as an opener.\n\n\"He has mastered that art (of reverse swing) now, bowling with the old ball and getting it to reverse.\"\n\nSouth Africa were staring down the barrel at 70-8 but Dane Piedt (56) and debutant Senuran Muthusamy (49 not out) put on 91 runs for the ninth wicket to frustrate the Indian bowlers briefly.\n\nShami got last man Kagiso Rabada caught behind for 18 to trigger celebrations in the Indian camp.\n\nSharma put India in a commanding position with a century in each innings on his debut as a Test opener -- a first by any batsman in Test history.\n\nHis knocks of 176 and 127, coupled with a fine 215-run innings by Mayank Agarwal, helped India put India in a commanding position.\n\n\"Once you have 500 on the board, it's difficult for the opposition. Mayank and Rohit played brilliantly,\" India skipper Virat Kohli said.\n\nShami took three key wickets in the morning session including that of skipper Faf du Plessis for 13 to dim South Africa's hopes of saving the game.\n\nJadeja soon joined forces to run through the middle order with three wickets in one over including that of overnight batsman Aiden Markram (39) with a one-handed return catch.\n\nThe Proteas resumed the day on 11 for one and soon the batting came under attack by some inspired Indian bowling on a pitch that offered variable bounce.\n\nOff-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin struck first to clean up overnight batsman Theunis de Bruyn for 10, becoming the joint-fastest to 350 wickets in his 66th Test.\n\nAshwin, who claimed eight wickets in the match and registered his 27th five-wicket haul on Friday, now shares the feat with Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan.\n\nHe finished the game with eight wickets.\n\nShami continued with his exploits, bowling Temba Bavuma for nought on a delivery that stayed low.\n\nThe veteran paceman came back in his second spell to rattle the stumps of captain du Plessis, who was leaving the incoming delivery, and Quinton de Kock for zero.\n\nThe match also witnessed the most number of sixes -- 37 from four innings -- surpassing the 35 that were smashed in a game between Pakistan and New Zealand in 2014-15.\n\nSharma -- India's limited-overs star -- got 13 of those sixes, the most in a five-day game by one batsman, breaking Wasim Akram's record of 12 for Pakistan.\n\nSouth African opener Elgar also made an impression with his 160 in his team's first innings total of 431 that appeared to bring the visitors back in the game.\n\n\"I thought up until this morning we competed really well,\" du Plessis said of the loss.\n\n\"On a day five pitch, things happen quicker, but it's the nature of Test cricket.\"\n\nThe second Test will begin on October 10 in Pune.\n\nScores in brief:\n\nIndia - 502/7 dec (Agarwal 215, Rohit 176, Maharaj 3/189) and 323/4 dec (Rohit 127, Pujara 81, Maharaj 2/129)\n\nSA 431 (Elgar 160, De Kock 111, Du Plessis 55, Ashwin 7/145) and 191 (Piedt 56, Muthusamy 49*, Markram 39, Shami 5/35, Jadeja 4/72)\n\nIndia won by 203 runs and lead the three-match series 1-0", "description": "The Proteas have lost the first Test against India after being rolled in the opening session of day 5 on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2860/6b79b411f3c64660923129c6101ff58b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
