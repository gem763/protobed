That\u2019s not going to happen at all. When will we land on Mars? Not in the 2020s.\u2019 He explained that \u2013 unlike trips to the Moon, which 12 people have now walked on \u2013 Mars is a \u2018different kettle of fish\u2019.\n\nTech entrepreneur Musk and his SpaceX team have proposed developing infrastructure on Mars and aim to get humans on the red planet by 2024.\n\nMusk says Saturday marked the 11th anniversary of a SpaceX rocket reaching orbit for the first time\n\nBirds fly overhead the huge silver rocket which is set to be launched by the end of the year\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk updates the next-generation Starship spacecraft at Brownsville, Texas\n\nA worker walks by the base of a prototype of SpaceX's Starship spacecraft at the company's Texas launch facility\n\nFlash in a pan: Rocket in TV series in 1936\n\nBut Mr Whitehouse told an audience at Henley Literary Festival: \u2018The Moon is three days away and you can get back with no problem. Mars is at least nine months away... It\u2019s probably a three-year round trip \u2013 so there is no coming back if there is a problem. It means you need a much better spacecraft, it means you have to have life cycles and recycling, because you can\u2019t take all the food you need to go there.\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t take all the oxygen you need, you need to recycle it. Experiments show the degradation of the human body is worse than we thought, particularly mental impairment \u2013 and that\u2019s after just a year in space. Also there\u2019s radiation and that\u2019s worse than we thought. And the expense.\u2019 However, at the SpaceX launch pad in Texas on Saturday, Musk told a crowd: \u2018We need to make space travel like air travel.\u2019 He said the critical breakthrough would be making \u2018a rapidly reusable orbital rocket\u2019.\n\nSpaceX currently flies two kinds of rocket \u2013 the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, the world\u2019s most powerful rocket \u2013 for NASA, the US Air Force and private satellite firms. It is planned that Starship will eventually fly atop a new booster rocket, the Super Heavy.", "description": "Former BBC science correspondent David Whitehouse has said people will not land on Mars in the 2020s.
