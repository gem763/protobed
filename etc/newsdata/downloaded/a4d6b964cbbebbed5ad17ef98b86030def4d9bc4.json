The challenge is tough but my priority will be to take Pakistan cricket on high,\u201d said Azhar in his first media interaction in Lahore after taking charge as captain of Pakistan team for the second time.\n\nAzhar last time captained the green shirts in a Test and 31 ODIs back from 2015 to 2017. After continuous failures as captain, he himself stepped down from the post.\n\nHailed from Lahore, Azhar believes that he has learnt a lot in last couple of years. \u201cYou will now see a completely different me. I have learnt a lot from my experiences and this upcoming opportunity will make me more strong,\u201d he said.\n\nThe right-handed batsman knows the importance of forthcoming tour of Australia which will be his first assignment as captain. \u201cOur track record in Australia is not too good. Beating Australia at their backyard is not easy but our priority will be to play aggressive cricket on challenging wickets there,\u201d Azhar said.\n\nTalking about Misbah-ul-Haq\u2019s presence as head coach and chief selector, Azhar thinks that it will help him a lot while working with his former teammate. \u201cI have played a lot of cricket with Misbah. Be it domestic cricket or International, Misbah has always helped me out,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has sacked Sarfraz Ahmed from all three format\u2019s captaincy. Azhar will lead Pakistan in ICC Test Championship 2019-2020 while Babar Azam has been appointed as the captain in T20Is till the upcoming T20 World Cup next year in Australia.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "The new captain of Pakistan team in Test cricket, Azhar Ali, confidently took the charge of the national team in red-ball format.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Azhar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
