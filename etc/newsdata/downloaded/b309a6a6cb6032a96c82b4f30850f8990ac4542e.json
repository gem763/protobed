It\u2019s hard enough getting used to a stepbrother or stepsister in a normal situation. Now imagine you\u2019re getting used to them while an Allosaurus and a family of Nasutoceratops go full WWE on your campsite. Such is life in the U.S. in the Jurassic Park universe.\n\nWritten by Trevorrow and screenwriter Emily Carmichael, \u201cBattle at Big Rock\u201d takes place a year after Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, offering a sneak-peek at all the stuff we will no longer be able to do when (and we do mean when) dinosaurs take over North America. Outdoor weddings? Absolutely not. Driving alongside cliffs? Big time no. Fishing? Basically get all your outdoor vacations in now, is the moral of the story. Jurassic World aside, what other franchises are you dying to see finagle a short film in between movies? Or, let\u2019s be honest here, which ones wouldn\u2019t you want to see?", "description": "Director Colin Trevorrow releases a short film in the world of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in which dinosaurs terrorize an American family while they camp.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/16-Battle-At-Big-Rock.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
