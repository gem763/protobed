Now, the families of those killed are still struggling to pick up the pieces in the wake of the nation\u2019s deadliest road transportation incident in 14 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough year. When you\u2019re grieving, you look for opportunities to get your mind off of what you lost and do some things you enjoy,\u201d Justin Cushing tells PEOPLE. \u201cBut a lot of those things just remind you of those you lost. You remember how much better they were with those people. It definitely has been difficult.\u201d\n\nJustin\u2019s brother, Patrick Cushing, his best friend, Adam Jackson, and cousin Erin McGowan were among the 17 passengers inside the limo who were killed in the crash on Oct. 6 last year. Driver Scott Lisinicchia also died.\n\nThe group was celebrating Amy Steenburg\u2019s 30th birthday when the party limo they were in failed to stop at a T-intersection. The limo flew into a nearby parking lot and crashed into an unoccupied SUV, killing everyone inside the limo.\n\nRELATED: Children of \u2018Amazing\u2019 Parents Killed in Limo Crash Are the \u2018Cutest,\u2019 But the Loss Is \u2018Tough\u2019\n\nAmanda Halse (left) and Patrick Cushing | Amanda Halse/Facebook More\n\nThe accident also claimed the lives of two pedestrians, who were struck by a parked SUV after it was slammed into by the limo.\n\nRELATED: 4 Sisters, an Iraq War Veteran and Newlyweds: All the Victims of the Horrific Limo Crash\n\nAlong with Patrick, Adam, Amy, and Erin, the victims include: Amanda Halse (Patrick\u2019s girlfriend), Axel Steenburg (Amy\u2019s husband), Rich Steenburg (Axel\u2019s brother), Abigail Jackson (Adam\u2019s wife), Allison King, Mary and Rob Dyson, Shane McGowan (Erin\u2019s husband), Matthew Coons, Savannah Bursese, Amanda Rivenburg, Brian Hough, James Schnurr, Michael Ukaj, Rachael Cavosie, and Lisinicchia (the driver).\n\n\u201cI got married [on Sept.] 29, so there was some joy. But my brother was supposed to be my best man. Adam was supposed to be in my wedding. There was some sadness there,\u201d Justin tells PEOPLE.\n\nDebris after limo crashes in Schoharie, New York | Hans Pennink/AP/Shutterstock More\n\nAmy, Abigail, Mary, and Allison were sisters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit overwhelming at times. We have a large community now of people who have lost someone close to them,\u201d Justin continues. \u201cThough I\u2019m going through it, I don\u2019t even know exactly what to say to some of the other parents, brothers, sisters, cousins, friends, that have lost people. You know how emotional it can be.\u201d", "description": "Remembering the 20 Lives Lost in the NY Limo Crash", "authors": ["Char Adams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kvDkvSGgerm54KxXyaR4fw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/1b0bf862f9b1c738df23a58ef82ce220", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
