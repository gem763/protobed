Most likely would have taken the top spot - Now he is also Dead! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nA spokesman for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is believed to have jointly conducted the mission, said there had been a \u201csuccessful raid targeting and arresting senior Isil members\u201d on Monday night without elaborating.\n\nLocal sources reported that the mission lasted no more than 20 minutes and no clashes were heard.\n\n\u201cAn Iraqi family had moved there in recent times,\u201d Aghiad al-Kheder, co-founder of anti-Isil activist group Sound and Picture, told the Telegraph. \u201cWe think two men were taken away by the helicopters.\u201d\n\nThe men\u2019s identity, or relationship to Baghdadi, was not immediately known.\n\n\u201cWe think it's related to the Baghdadi raid,\u201d said Mr Kheder, whose group has sources on the ground in the area. \u201dFor sure US found important documents and maybe in the next few days we will see many operations like this.\u201d\n\nPentagon officials told the Washington Post that the documents and other information gathered during the raid on the compound in Barisha in Idlib province close to the Turkish border would prove useful in hunting down remaining senior Isil figures.\n\nThe officials said two men were also captured alive in the raid who they hoped could provide intelligence about the group.\n\nEvidence was growing that Isil had an established smuggling ring, taking senior members from Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria and Qaim in western Iraqi to Idlib.\n\nPolat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF, last night revealed more detailed information about the group's role in finding Baghdadi.\n\n\"Since 15 May, we have been working together with the CIA,\" he revealed on Twitter. He said their surveillance tracked the 48-year-old reclusive leader moving to the village of Barisha in northern Idlib from northern Deir Ezzor in April.\n\nHe said the SDF used a \"human asset\" with access to the compound to steal a pair of underpants belonging to the Isil leader. It was later tested and it came back positive.\n\nIraqi officials confirmed to the Telegraph that they had arrested members of Baghdadi\u2019s inner circle who were part of the ring and gave up the leader\u2019s location.\n\nIt is thought fighters with the Islamist group Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-aligned group which is usually hostile to Isil, were also facilitating senior Isil leaders\u2019 movement through rebel-held Idlib.\n\nBaghdadi was discovered at the house of one Hurras al-Din commander, Abu Mohamed al-Halabi, who was killed in the raid.\n\nMustafa Bali, SDF\u2019s spokesman, said that Muhajir, described as Baghdadi\u2019s right-hand man, was believed to have been in the area in order to facilitate Baghdadi\u2019s movements in Idlib and possibly on to Turkey.\n\nMuhajir was targeted in the village of Ain al-Baydah near Turkish-administered Jarablus with the help of SDF intelligence.\n\nLocal sources said Muhajir had been travelling in a convoy made up of an oil tanker and a car.\n\nThe SDF has questioned how Ankara was not aware of the presence of Baghdadi and other senior leaders so close to areas in Syria under its control.", "description": "The US is believed to have carried out fresh raids on suspected senior Islamic State members in Syria overnight, as officials assessed a treasure trove of intelligence gathered from Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s final hideout.
