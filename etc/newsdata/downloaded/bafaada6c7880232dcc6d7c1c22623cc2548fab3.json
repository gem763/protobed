The problem's name is Philippe Coutinho, and the problem with Philippe Coutinho is that he is just too good.\n\nHaving hit a career low at Barcelona in recent years, former Liverpool star Coutinho is returning to his best form in the Bundesliga. With two goals and three assists from his first eight games, the season-long loan spell in Munich appears to be just what the doctor ordered for the shy Brazilian star.\n\nGiven the wave of excitement which greeted Coutinho's arrival at Bayern last summer, there were justified fears that the Brazilian would struggle under the weight of expectation, and take a while to accustom himself to life in Germany. The opposite has been true, as the 27-year-old has gone from strength to strength in recent weeks.\n\nBayern Munich coach Niko Kovac has a problem. The problem's name is Philippe Coutinho\n\nA beautiful chipped assist against Paderborn two weeks ago was one of several moments which had Bayern fans gasping in delight at their new signing, and Coutinho has also endeared himself to his team-mates.\n\n'He is almost perfect on the ball,' gushed Manuel Neuer recently. The infamously goal-greedy Robert Lewandowski, meanwhile, stunned the nation when he allowed Coutinho to take a penalty against Cologne a week earlier, foregoing his own hat-trick so that the Brazilian could score his first Bayern goal.\n\nIn the space of just a few months, Coutinho has become a player transformed from the one whom readers of Spanish newspaper Marca voted the worst midfielder of last season.\n\nSuddenly, the little magician so adored by Liverpool fans is back on the scene. As Coutinho himself admits, that is partly down to the similarities between English and German football.\n\n'The Bundesliga and the Premier League are very similar in terms of intensity,' he told the Bundesliga website last month. 'In La Liga, teams sit deep against Barcelona... but here you don't have time to think. Every ball is war.'\n\nThe similarities don't end on the pitch. Bayern pride themselves on taking care of their players better than other major clubs, and Coutinho has said that the family atmosphere around the club reminds him of his time under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nAs he has returned to full fitness, Coutinho has become an indispensable part of Kovac's plans\n\n'Everything here is very much like a family. I had that in Liverpool, but here it is perhaps a bit more so,' he told Sky Sports.\n\nThat family atmosphere pervades all aspects of the club, with some staff members speaking to Coutinho in Portuguese while Spanish speaking colleagues such as Thiago Alcantara have helped him integrate in the dressing room.\n\nFor his part, the Brazilian has made the right noises in terms of integration, promising to try to learn German and dutifully singing the praises of Lederhosen and the Oktoberfest.\n\nCoutinho's rise has seen fellow attacking midfielder Thomas Muller pushed to the sidelines\n\nPHILIPPE COUTINHO'S STATS FOR SEASON Appearances: 8 Goals: 2 Assists: 3\n\nThe 27-year-old is not the most imposing of characters. An amiable and softly spoken family man, such platitudes about Bavarian culture and the beauty of the city of Munich are about as much insight as he gives into the challenges of his new life. Yet for his fellow Brazilian and former Bayern star Paulo Sergio, Munich is the perfect place for his sensitive compatriot.\n\n'I spoke to him and he told me he feels comfortable in Munich,' Sergio told Sport1. 'He is somebody who needs motivation. But I played alongside Niko Kovac at Bayern and Leverkusen, and he knows about Brazilians and their mentality.'\n\nKovac has certainly struck up a strong relationship with his new player, with Coutinho calling him 'a super guy and a top coach' in a recent interview with Sport Bild magazine. As he has returned to full fitness, Coutinho has become an indispensable part of Kovac's plans, starting in all of Bayern's last four games.\n\nYet the strength of that relationship is not without its problems. Coutinho's rise has seen Bayern legend and fellow attacking midfielder Thomas Muller pushed to the sidelines, and that is something that Bayern coaches do at their peril. Kovac is not the first Bayern coach to be presented with the conundrum, but it is a new one for the Croatian.\n\nWhereas his cool relationship with James Rodriguez last season allowed him to rotate the Colombian and Muller, that may prove more difficult with Coutinho. The Bayern coach has already declared that he thinks playing both players alongside each other would be 'too attacking'.\n\nAll it took was a move to Munich, and the little magician is back to his magical best\n\nMuller, who is also in excellent form with four assists already this season, is understandably aggrieved. Having played no more than half an hour in Bayern's last five matches, the 30-year-old fired a warning shot at Kovac this week, telling Kicker magazine that he would have to consider his future if the coach continued to treat him as a substitute.\n\nThe duel between the two attacking midfielders could be a decisive sub-plot in Bayern's season, but it remains a problem for Kovac rather than one between the two players.\n\nMuller has insisted that his frustration is nothing personal against Coutinho, who has said that the German welcomed him to Bayern with open arms.\n\n'He is an idol in Germany and at Bayern, and he has given me a fantastic welcome,' Coutinho told Sport Bild last month. 'It's a joy to be in the same team as him, and he has made my start here very comfortable.'\n\nThat, it seems, is the measure of Coutinho, who has endeared himself to everyone at Bayern, even to a player with whom he is in direct competition.\n\nLong term, Kovac will need to find a way to harmonise his two attacking midfield stars, but in the meantime, nothing is going to wipe the grin off Coutinho's face.
