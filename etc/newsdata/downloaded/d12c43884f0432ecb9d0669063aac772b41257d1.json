Then there is a secondary layer to his struggles. It seems to those at the club that Ramsey has not understood the correct rhythm and demands of Italian style training.\n\nAARON RAMSEY 2019-20 JUVENTUS STATS Games: 4 Minutes: 198 Goals: 1 Assists: 0\n\nJuventus return to action in Serie A against Bologna at the Allianz Stadium this weekend - but many expect Ramsey to miss out.\n\nMaurizio Sarri intends to train the player calmly, not wanting to rush his recovery.\n\nBut with every game he does not start, Juventus fans' frustration builds with many afraid that Ramsey may have a career tormented by injuries like Claudio Marchisio. This is not a rash judgement, it is one that has formed among supporters in recent weeks.\n\nDespite having muscle fatigue, Ramsey was summoned by Wales boss Ryan Giggs for the recent double header against Slovakia and Croatia - a move Juventus did not approve of.\n\nThey would have much preferred to hold on to Ramsey over the international break and treat the player in Turin at the club's Continassa training ground.\n\nRamsey worked away from the main group and did not feature in either Euro 2020 qualifier for Wales, responding positively to his separate training plan before arriving back in Italy.\n\nHis call-up by Wales was contentious but he did work separate to the main first-team group\n\nJuventus fans are wary he will be ravaged like injury just as Claudio Marchisio (right) was\n\nWith Adrien Rabiot in an identity crisis, Emre Can seemingly in limbo, it will be up to Sami Khedira, 32, and Blaise Matuidi, 32, to work overtime. With Ramsey yet to establish himself in the side, 22-year-old Rodrigo Bentancur could benefit from some chance of playing in the starting 11.\n\nSarri is hopeful to get Ramsey back for the first Champions League match at home against Lokomotiv Moscow on October 22.\n\nJuventus are willing to wait for the Welshman, but he must adapt to demands in Italy and prove he is not a player who is now too fragile to compete at the top level for a big club.", "description": "ALVISE CAGNAZZO IN ITALY: The Caerphilly-born midfielder is muscular yet fragile and at the age of 30, he finds rapid physical recovery difficult to achieve, which has raised fears among supporters.", "authors": ["Alvise Cagnazzo For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/12/19882144-0-image-a-2_1571399120909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
