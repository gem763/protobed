An all-electric F-150 is in the works, a $500 million investment into Rivian was promised, as was the debut of its first mass-market EV. For the latter, we finally have an unveiling date in the books.\n\nFord\u2019s Mustang-inspired battery-electric SUV will be revealed to the public on November 17, according to a press release. The company\u2019s announcement is light on other details (in the sense that there are none), but they did release a teaser video you can watch below.\n\nWhen Ford initially said it was working on an electric SUV inspired by its famous Mustang, people were flummoxed. Why throw the muscle car name into the mix at all? If we look at the facts, it makes sense: Ford is investing $11 billion into EVs and SUV sales are soaring, but people are still skeptical of the technology. So it would seem that by using a household name and the most popular configuration, Ford is looking to succeed where other EV releases have failed.\n\nAs CNBC reports, there are a few other tidbits the automaker has let slip. First of all, it\u2019s going to be a \u201cperformance SUV,\u201d meaning it will probably offer above-average horsepower and speed to do justice to the name. Also, as CNBC writes, \u201c\u2026 ordering for the vehicle will start in conjunction with the SUV\u2019s unveiling during a private event on on [sic] Nov. 17, days ahead of its public debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\u201d\n\nSo while the unveiling date is not the on-sale date, and you most likely won\u2019t get a chance to drive the zero-emission, dad-bod Mustang for months, you will apparently be able to order it before the holidays.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "Ford previously announced that it would release an all-electric SUV inspired by its Mustang muscle car, now the automaker has set a date for its unveiling.", "authors": ["Alex Lauer"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mustang_hero.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
