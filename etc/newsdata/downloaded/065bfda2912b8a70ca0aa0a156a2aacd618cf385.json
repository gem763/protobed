He then accused Vindman of being a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d, or a dyed-in-the-wool Trump critic, but the claim was quickly debunked in multiple reports.\n\nThat did not stop Trump\u2019s defenders in the media from attacking Vindman as disloyal.\n\n\u201cHere we have a US national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest, and usually, they spoke in English,\u201d said Fox News host Laura Ingraham. \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?!\u201d\n\nHer guest, John Yoo, a former George W Bush administration lawyer infamous for drafting a framework for torture, agreed. \u201cYou know, some people might call that espionage,\u201d Yoo said.\n\nBut the backlash in the Republican ranks, rare where Trump is involved, was unusually harsh.\n\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s a Purple Heart. I think it would be a mistake to attack his credibility,\u201d John Thune, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, told Politico. \u201cYou can obviously take issue with the substance and there are different interpretations about all that stuff. But I wouldn\u2019t go after him personally. He\u2019s a patriot.\u201d\n\nCongresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the daughter of former vice-presidentDick Cheney, and a member of the House Republican leadership, echoed Thune in a press conference.\n\n\u201cWe need to show that we are better than that as a nation,\u201d said Cheney. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who put their lives on the line. And it is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in this process.\u201d\n\nAs news of Vindman\u2019s testimony leaked out of the deposition room, it emerged that he had kept his own set of notes about the 25 July call between Trump and Zelenskiy, in which Trump asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d and repeatedly brought up Biden, a leading Democratic candidate in the 2020 election. It was just one more piece of evidence in a mounting pile in which each layer seems to exactly confirm the one beneath it.\n\nUkraine wants to stay out of Trump impeachment inquiry, says official Read more\n\nPressure on Trump in the impeachment inquiry is mounting rapidly. House speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would vote Thursday on a resolution to move the proceedings out of closed-door depositions and into open hearings. At that point, many Americans would for the first time encounter the damaging accusations against Trump from the witnesses making them.\n\nOn the Senate floor Monday, majority leader Mitch McConnell, a prominent Trump defender, called the House proceedings a \u201csham\u201d.\n\nBut with each witness to testify, Trump\u2019s defense, amplified by Republicans, has weakened further. Trump has insisted he was only interested in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, denied a political motive for seeking investigations of Biden, denied that military aid for Ukraine was withheld for inappropriate leverage, and denied that any of his conduct was untoward.\n\nThe only defense left on Tuesday was to attack the messenger. But the attack appears to have bounced off the medals on Vindman\u2019s chest.", "description": "Lt Col Vindman\u2019s testimony drew expected backlash from Trump defenders, but some Republicans say they\u2019ve gone too far", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be2305f29d6cd26bce087fbafd2c6cef5c578fb0/0_236_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c69c7612e66937bced7766cce4473431", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
