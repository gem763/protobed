That case was filed by El Paso County and an immigrant rights group, the Border Network for Human Rights, through a Washington-based watchdog group, Protect Democracy.\n\nBriones said El Paso\u2019s standing was bolstered by indications that $20 million in funds that would otherwise be spent for construction within its borders at the Fort Bliss Army based would be diverted for the border project. He also said the county\u2019s reputation was at risk from the spending because of Trump\u2019s contention that it was needed to check chaos and lawlessness at the border.\n\nThe judge said he was not interfering with $2.5 billion at issue in the California case, but he did appear to intend to halt an additional $3.6 billion in spending planned by the administration. However, his decision Friday did not specify the exact scope of the injunction he plans to impose as a result of his ruling. He gave the plaintiffs 10 days to submit specifics for that and five days for the federal government to respond.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling, but lawyers pressing the suit quickly hailed the judge\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cAs someone who served in government under a Republican administration, I never imagined a Republican president would attempt to expand executive power this far by overriding the appropriations power that belongs to Congress,\u201d said Stuart Gerson, who served as a senior Justice Department official under former President George H.W. Bush and acting attorney general under Clinton.\n\n\u201cI hope today\u2019s ruling will prompt Republicans in Washington to recommit to the checks and balances that have defined our Republic and protected our freedom,\u201d Gerson added.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling vindicates the Founders\u2019 wisdom and confirms that the president is not a king, and that he cannot override Congress\u2019s power to decide how to appropriate funds,\u201d said Kristy Parker, an attorney with Protect Democracy.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/75/97/02ab2bd34604b76cef0fcaca5333/0916wall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
