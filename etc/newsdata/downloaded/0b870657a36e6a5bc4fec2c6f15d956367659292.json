He hit nine during his 37-point third quarter - also a record - against Sacramento on Jan. 23, 2015.\n\nEdwards finished 9 of 15 from 3-point range and scored 30 points.\n\nCELTICS 118, CAVALIERS 95\n\nTremont Waters added 24 points, matching Edwards from the field at 10-of-16 shooting, and seven assists while Boston rested most of its regulars.\n\nCollin Sexton led the Cleveland (1-3) starters with 20 points. Darius Garland, the No. 5 overall pick in June, added 16.\n\n76ERS 106, PISTONS 86\n\nJoel Embiid scored 20 of Philadelphia\u2019s 51 first-half points and finished with 24 points and eight rebounds as the 76ers and Pistons played short-handed.\n\nBen Simmons (back), James Ennis (calf) and Al Horford (rest) did not play for Philadelphia (4-0). Blake Griffin (hamstring), Andre Drummond (rest) and Markieff Morris (bronchitis) all sat out for Detroit (2-2).\n\nTobias Harris added 10 points, all in the first half, for Philadelphia, and rookie Matisse Thybulle had seven points, six rebounds, four steals and two blocks. Norvel Pelle added five blocks.\n\nChristian Wood scored 19 points for Detroit and Tony Snell added 17. The teams combined to make just 12 of 50 from 3-point range.\n\nTIMBERWOLVES 119, PACERS 111\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns had 33 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three blocks to lead Minnesota.\n\nRobert Covington added 10 points and 19 boards, and each Minnesota (2-2) starter scored at least nine points.\n\nDomantas Sabonis had 11 points and 13 rebounds in the first half for Indiana (3-1). No other starter for the Pacers reached double-digit scoring.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "From Larry Bird to Ray Allen, the Boston Celtics have suited up some of the best perimeter shooters in NBA history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/celtics_cavaliers_basketball_54300_c0-1212-2643-2753_s1200x700.jpg?dc809fd903a6bb1550b1dfe207e26b91ebf342aa", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
