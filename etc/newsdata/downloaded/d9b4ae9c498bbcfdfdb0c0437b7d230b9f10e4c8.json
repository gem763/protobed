Now she\u2019s charged with murder.", "language": "en", "text": "The prosecution and defense each provided few details in the murky case, and the criminal complaint remains under seal. Orange County officials did not immediately respond to The Washington Post\u2019s request for additional records, including the incident report and coroner\u2019s report for Sokalski\u2019s death.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a brief statement Monday, Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer alleged that Koepplin helped Sokalski die in April 2018 by injecting him with drugs. The Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department opened an investigation into Sokalski\u2019s death after his body was discovered by staff at a hotel in Mission Viejo, Calif.\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s right to die law strictly governs the conditions under which terminally ill adult patients with the capacity to make medical decisions can be prescribed an aid-in-dying medication,\u201d Spitzer said in a statement. \u201cThat was not the case here. It is beyond disturbing that someone who is trained as a nurse to aid the sick and the dying would twist their duty to willingly end the life of another human being.\u201d\n\nTwo months after Sokalski\u2019s death, a California appeals court reinstated the state\u2019s controversial right-to-die law which allows terminally ill patients with fewer than six months to live to request lethal drugs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMichael Guisti, Koepplin\u2019s attorney, denies wrongdoing by his client and disputes the prosecutor\u2019s allegation that Koepplin was even present at Sokalski\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe she acquiesced to any request at all. If you look at the DA\u2019s press statement, there\u2019s a huge leap of faith \u2014 and almost nothing till we get to an assisted suicide accusation,\u201d Guisti told The Post on Wednesday. \u201cIn this case, especially since it has that \u2018angel of death\u2019 aura around it, people are paying attention, [but] my client just didn\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nA relative for Sokalski did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nGuisti said Sokalski was \u201capparently heartbroken over some other woman \u2014 that\u2019s what we\u2019re understanding precipitated this thing.\u201d He confirmed that Sokalski and Koepplin had been friends for several years and credited Sokalski for introducing Koepplin to her now-husband.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKoepplin and her husband sold their home in California last year and moved to Peoria, Ariz., according to Guisti.\n\nGuisti said Koepplin was aware that she had been under investigation for the past 16 months, but that her previous attorney in Arizona told her that charges were unlikely; he said it was unclear why the DA\u2019s office was pursing Koepplin now. In criticizing the Orange County DA\u2019s office for what he characterized as overly-aggressive prosecution \u201cand a rush to judgment,\u201d Guisti invoked his former client, Michelle Hadley.\n\nHadley was framed and jailed for three months in a high-profile 2016 case in which Orange County prosecutors accused her of orchestrating an elaborate kidnapping and \u201crape fantasy\u201d plot to endanger the woman who married her ex-fiancee. Hadley was later exonerated by the same office; prosecutors ultimately charged the wife of Hadley\u2019s ex-fiancee with the scheme.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have a newly elected DA and he\u2019s not gonna let go of anything that has sizzle,\u201d Guisti said.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson from Spitzer\u2019s office declined to comment on further details of the case but said via email, \u201cwe only file cases if we can prove the facts beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\u201d\n\nKoepplin faces up to 25 years to life in prison if convicted. Her trial is slated for January.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The registered nurse has pleaded not guilty.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yLdcatdrMiRhDBneJghch6b5kNw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QKZVEKUPLMI6RLSZAGEA5LC7DU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
