Brown becomes a free agent but his prospects of signing with another team are complicated by the possibility that the league could, if he\u2019s signed, put him on paid administrative leave via placement on its commissioner\u2019s exempt list. If he\u2019s placed on the list, Brown would be paid his salary but would be ineligible to participate in a team\u2019s practices or attend its games.\n\nBrown reacted to the move on social media, thanking the Patriots and writing, \u201cThe marathon continues.\u201d Later, he added \u201cJust got fired on Friday.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s move by the Patriots was just the latest episode in a saga that has disrupted the NFL\u2019s celebration of its 100th season and complicated the operations of franchises on both coasts, most recently those of the six-time Super Bowl champions. Brown this summer regularly took his views and complaints to social media, fighting the NFL over his desire to use a helmet not up to the league\u2019s safety standards and clashing with Oakland Raiders General Manager Mike Mayock, leading to his release from Oakland and his arrival in New England earlier this month. The past two weeks brought allegations of inappropriate and disturbing behavior toward women, although without criminal charges.\n\n[From earlier: It\u2019s Antonio Brown\u2019s NFL now, and everyone else is just living in it]\n\nThe Patriots previously had appeared intent on keeping Brown on their roster while deferring to the league\u2019s investigation but took action Friday after a report Thursday night by Sports Illustrated about the text messages allegedly sent by Brown. Brown, 31, played in one game for the Patriots. He did not play in a single game for the Raiders, who had obtained him in an offseason trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nBrown\u2019s one-year contract with the Patriots was worth up to $15 million and included a $9 million signing bonus. The first payment of that bonus, for $5 million, is due Monday. The team could attempt to void the guaranteed money in Brown\u2019s deal under a clause in his contract prohibiting him from taking any action that \u201cmaterially undermines the public\u2019s respect for\u201d the team. That potentially would lead to a grievance by Brown through the NFL Players Association.\n\nBrown\u2019s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, wrote on Twitter it was \u201cunfortunate things didn\u2019t work out with the Patriots\u201d but added that Brown is \u201chealthy and is looking forward to his next opportunity in the NFL.\u201d Rosenhaus wrote that Brown hopes to play \u201csoon\u201d for another team.\n\nPatriots Coach Bill Belichick said earlier Friday at his regular media briefing in Foxborough, Mass., that the team was \u201clooking into\u201d the situation.\n\n\u201cI know there are questions about Antonio,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cWe take all the situations with our team very seriously. There are some things that we\u2019re looking into. I'm not going to comment on any of the off-the-field situations.\u201d\n\nFor the second time since last week, Belichick cut short a news conference because of questioning about Brown.\n\n\n\nThe New England Patriots released wide receiver Antonio Brown. (Lynne Sladky)\n\nBrown has not been charged with a crime. But a former college classmate who worked for Brown as a trainer, Britney Taylor, accused Brown in a lawsuit in Florida of rape and sexual assault in three separate incidents in 2017 and 2018. Brown has denied the allegations through his attorney, who said that Brown regards the lawsuit as a \u201cmoney grab.\u201d\n\nTaylor met with NFL representatives for 10 hours Monday as part of the league\u2019s investigation.\n\nAnother woman, through her attorney, accused Brown of sending threatening text messages to her Wednesday night.\n\nThe woman told Sports Illustrated in a previous report that Brown hired her in 2017 to paint a mural in his home but cut off contact with her when she ignored his unwanted sexual advance. After that initial report, according to Sports Illustrated, the woman received a group text Wednesday night that appeared to come from a number Brown had previously provided to her, accusing her of fabricating her account of the alleged 2017 incident. The text chain included photos of her and her children and was characterized by the woman as intimidating, according to the report.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy specifically prohibits \u201cstalking, harassment, or similar forms of intimidation.\u201d\n\nIn a phone conversation Friday evening, Lisa Banks, an attorney for the woman, said she and her client sent the NFL a letter Thursday night detailing Brown\u2019s messages to the woman. NFL officials responded immediately, Banks said, and arranged a phone conversation for Friday morning.\n\nThe NFL \u201cclearly took this seriously,\u201d Banks said. By the time she and her client spoke Friday morning with the with NFL, league officials had already reached out to the Patriots and Brown\u2019s representatives to instruct Brown to cease contact with the woman.\n\nWhile Brown faces no criminal charges, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is empowered under the conduct policy to place a player on paid leave if he believes after an investigation that a player may have violated the policy. NFL officials said their investigation began after news of the lawsuit being filed was reported Sept. 10.\n\nIf Brown is signed by a team and placed on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list, Goodell would decide when to remove him from it. The list is designed to keep a player off the field until the league decides whether to discipline him under the conduct policy, generally with a suspension without pay.\n\nBrown could appeal being placed on the exempt list through the NFLPA. But the appeal would be resolved by Goodell, who has broad authority to discipline players under the personal conduct policy. The NFLPA\u2019s attempts to challenge that authority in court mostly have failed. An arbitrator also upheld the league\u2019s use of the exempt list for paid leave for players after the union filed a grievance.\n\nBrown made his only appearance for the Patriots in their victory last Sunday at Miami. He had four catches for 56 yards and a touchdown. He had become one of the NFL\u2019s most productive pass-catchers for the Steelers, being selected to seven Pro Bowls and averaging 114 catches for 1,524 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nBrown agreed to a contract Sept. 7 with the Patriots, hours after he was released by the Raiders.\n\nAdam Kilgore contributed to this report.\n\nRead more NFL coverage:\n\nNFL power rankings Week 3: Cowboys, Ravens move up as others suffer QB unrest\n\nBrewer: If Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger can\u2019t stay healthy, good luck to the NFL\n\nThe NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive\n\nLamar Jackson will let you choose how he beats you\n\nTroy Aikman says NFL officiating issues are \u2018maddening\u2019 and \u2018nauseating\u2019\n\nEli Manning being benched for Daniel Jones was inevitable.
