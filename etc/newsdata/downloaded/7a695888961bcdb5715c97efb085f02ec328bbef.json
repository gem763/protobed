He often gets into cars, vans, buses and trains. So I thought something like that happened.\n\nHe\u2019s got hundreds of followers on Facebook (Picture: Jackie Hood /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018I soon told my daughter Jackie and she put a post out on social media.\n\n\u2018We started getting messages from people saying they had seen him.\n\n\u2018A couple from Helensburgh saw him and brought him back to us.\n\n\u2018Since he has been back he keeps trying to go back out.\n\n\u2018But he is in detention and I won\u2019t let him out until he calms down a bit.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth and husband Dennis, 90, rescued George five years ago.\n\nThe gran-of-two said the cat has offered great comfort to Dennis who suffers from dementia.\n\nShe said: \u2018George lies on his knee and they fall asleep together.\n\n\u2018George goes out every day. He goes on pavements and visits his pals.\n\n\u2018He is such a friendly animal and that\u2019s his biggest problem.\n\nHe\u2019s quite the social media star (Picture: Jackie Hood /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018He loves to be stroked and picked up by people.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s such a funny character.\n\n\u2018People seem to love him, he certainly has a lot of followers.\u2019\n\nDaughter Jackie, 50, helped her parents set up George\u2019s Facebook page, which now has 800 followers, three months ago.\n\nThe mum-of-two said: \u2018When George is at home he doesn\u2019t want attention from anyone apart from my dad.\n\n\u2018But when he is out he has a secret life.\n\n\u2018The local primary school had a trip to the safari park. I am not sure how but George managed to sneak into the bus and fortunately the bus stopped and chucked him out before arriving there.\n\n\u2018He has got into a few local buses a few times too.\n\n\u2018He has also got into a train going to Edinburgh and a ScotRail staff member messaged me to say they had to put him out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He is certainly a cat that enjoys travelling. I have no idea how often he does this.\n\n\u2018You never know where he is going, we just find out once he has been caught.\n\n\u2018I set up a Facebook page for him about three months ago and that\u2019s how I started finding out about his weird adventures.\n\n\u2018He goes to a nursery up the road.\n\n\u2018He gets in and out of people\u2019s houses.\n\n\u2018He goes to the local Tesco store and he tries to get into people\u2019s cars at the carpark.\n\n\u2018He goes to local garages and he is not afraid to stand up to dogs.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve also been told that he has been behind a bar which is unbelievable.\n\n\u2018Everyone knows him.\u2019\n\nMORE: Boy with cancer whose dream of getting dog helped him through treatment is given adorable puppy\n\nMORE: Little girl caught on camera saying \u2018this is how we f*** it up\u2019 as she eats tagliatelle\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A cat has become a social media star and famous on Facebook after his owners documented his travels around the country.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88968915_1570597828.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
