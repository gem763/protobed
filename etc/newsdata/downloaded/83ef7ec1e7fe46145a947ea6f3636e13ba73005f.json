For many lawmakers, it would be a choice between two different types of misery.\n\nOpponents of Brexit, or this particular deal, would voice strong objections to whatever Johnson brings back (if indeed he pushes ahead with an agreement laden with British concessions). But would Brexit-weary voters forgive a party that turned down a deal now? Johnson is betting they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nWinning support from his own Conservative MPs should be more straightforward for Johnson than it was for Theresa May, his predecessor in No. 10. Lee Rowley, a Tory MP who opposed May\u2019s deal three times, was speaking for others too when he said on Monday: \u201cFor the health of our democracy and to restore faith in this most venerable of institutions, in my view we simply must get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nThe so-called Spartans among Conservative lawmakers who refused to support May\u2019s withdrawal deal have given signs they\u2019ll back their new leader. They\u2019re deeply worried that further delays to Brexit will hurt the Conservatives\u2019 chances at an imminent general election and increase the likelihood of the U.K. not quitting the EU at all.\n\nIt helps that some arch-Brexiters are now on the government payroll. Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, has even suggested that if Johnson comes back with terms like those he described previously as \u201ccretinous\u201d when they had May\u2019s name on them, he\u2019d probably support them.\n\nThat wall of endorsement might crumble if Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party \u2014 the Conservatives\u2019 parliamentary allies \u2014 withheld their blessing; and EU officials believe Johnson won\u2019t give the green light to a deal unless he\u2019s sure the DUP will back it. Arlene Foster, the party\u2019s leader, said of his potential deal on Tuesday evening: \u201cIt would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s proposed concessions to Brussels are thought to include customs checks between the U.K. mainland and Northern Ireland, anathema to unionists.\n\nBut maybe the DUP can be bought off by promises of billions of extra cash from Westminster for Northern Ireland. And Johnson will have been buoyed somewhat by potential support for his putative deal from some Brexiter MPs in the opposition Labour Party.\n\nIndeed, Labour\u2019s mightily complicated Brexit position will look even more awkward if Johnson came back to Parliament with a deal and DUP support. The party leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit strategy has assumed an almost infinite level of public patience: First win a general election (which will have to take place soon given Johnson\u2019s lack of a majority), then renegotiate the Brexit deal and then hold a referendum on whether to remain or leave with Labour\u2019s deal. With the British public exhausted by Brexit, a Johnson deal would look like more of an election winner for the Tories.\n\nAny deal vote in Parliament will almost certainly include an amendment demanding the agreement be put to the people in a confirmatory referendum. Some Labour MPs favor the party backing such a referendum before agreeing to a new general election. But that would require another long extension of the Brexit process, again not something that\u2019s going to be loved by many British voters.\n\nThe position of the centrist Liberal Democrats, revived under leader Jo Swinson as the Stop Brexit party, will be important. The Lib Dems support a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d on any agreed Brexit deal, although their preference is to revoke Brexit altogether. But if getting a referendum required a vote of no-confidence in Johnson, Swinson has refused to back even a temporary replacement government with Corbyn in charge. So the Labour leader would have to let someone else become prime minister or Swinson would have to accept him in Downing Street. Neither outcome looks likely.\n\nIn other words, all parties are considering not just the terms of Johnson\u2019s possible deal but the terms on which they will fight the election. A vote for a deal would be a vote to end this phase of the Brexit negotiations and pave the way for the general election, although it would strengthen Johnson going into it. A vote against a deal would probably mean an extension from the EU to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline and more uncertainty, perhaps still including an election. Voters again may reward Johnson for his efforts to break the impasse and penalize MPs who got in the way.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If, as reports suggest, British and European Union negotiators are inching toward a point where they can present a Brexit deal for approval, the U.K. parliament will soon have a historic decision to make on whether to back it.
