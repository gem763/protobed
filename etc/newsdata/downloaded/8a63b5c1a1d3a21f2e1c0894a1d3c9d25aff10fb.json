This may include websites you used for printing your Instagram photos, various dating apps or Instagram tools for making collages, finding your top photos and more.\n\nProviding a tool to remove third-party apps\u2019 access to your account is now a fairly commonplace security setting among platform providers. Instagram is late to offer such functionality. Twitter, Facebook and Google have had similar functionality in place for years.\n\nAnd Instagram isn\u2019t hurrying its launch, either.\n\nThe company says its new security features will take a whopping six months to reach all users, as it\u2019s designed to be a gradual rollout. For comparison\u2019s sake, most new features tend to roll out in days or sometimes weeks, but rarely as long as half a year.\n\nThe choice to move slowly is worth calling out here \u2014 especially given that Instagram\u2019s parent company Facebook\u2019s massive personal data scandal, Cambridge Analytica, arose because users had connected to a third-party app that improperly collected users\u2019 personal data.\n\nInstagram, arguably, has less of a treasure trove of personal information on hand to tap into, compared with Facebook. But there\u2019s still no need to let some app you used once, many years ago, continue to access information like your Instagram username, your photos, all your captions, timestamps of your posts, permalinks and more. And if you maintain a private account with the intention of only sharing your content with close friends and family, this level of access might make you even more uncomfortable.\n\nWhile Instagram isn\u2019t clear in its public announcement about its reasoning for such a slow rollout, it\u2019s tied to API changes for developers. The company is giving developers time to move from the Instagram Legacy API Platform to the Facebook Graph API.\n\nAs the company explains in a developer announcement, the new API will enable \u201cappropriate consumer use-cases, while protecting user privacy and safety\u201d \u2014 including giving users the ability to decide what information they share with apps, then revoke access through the Instagram mobile app. The legacy API platform will be deprecated on March 2, 2020.\n\nIt would have made sense for Instagram to communicate to users that the gradual rollout is because it\u2019s giving developers time to get their apps ready for these changes. But because it didn\u2019t mention this, the news of the slow rollout comes across as Instagram not believing such a feature is a priority or important to users.\n\nIf you have the new security setting, you\u2019ll find it under \u201cSettings\u201d in the Instagram app. It will be under \u201cSecurity,\u201d then \u201cApps and Websites.\u201d From this screen, you can tap \u201cRemove\u201d on any apps you don\u2019t want connected to your Instagram account.\n\nRelated to this, Instagram says it\u2019s also introducing an updated authorization screen that will detail all the information an app is requesting when you go to authorize it to connect to your Instagram account. If you think it\u2019s over-reaching, you can just choose \u201cCancel\u201d instead of \u201cAuthorize.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the new features now, just wait until sometime in 2020, I guess.", "description": "Instagram is slowly rolling out\u00a0a new feature that will help better protect your personal data from being accessed by your long-discarded, third-party applications \u2014 that is, any app you had once authorized to access your Instagram profile over the years.
