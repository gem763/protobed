We\u2019ll take a comprehensive look across the DFS industry to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe will be looking at the five-game main slate starting at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nZack Wheeler - NY Mets (vs. Miami)\n\nThis is an abbreviated five-game evening slate, and I\u2019m not looking to get sneaky at pitcher. Wheeler is the most expensive hurler in the player pool while noticing a price increase after allowing just one earned run in each of his past five starts. He\u2019ll step into the best possible matchup against a Miami offense that ranks near the bottom in every crucial hitting category. You could look towards Aaron Civale or Sean Manaea in tournaments, but Wheeler is the obvious cash game choice tonight.\n\nAlso Consider: Sean Manaea, Aaron Civale\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nCarlos Santana - Cleveland (at Chicago White Sox)\n\nWhite Sox RHP Dylan Cease has been surprisingly good lately, but tonight\u2019s date with the Indians represents a tougher test than his last two against Seattle and Detroit respectively. In other words, Cease\u2019s .381 wOBA split to left-handed bats could be exposed, and Santana is a prime candidate to make that happen. A Cleveland stack of Santana, Jose Ramirez, and Francisco Lindor (plus a few others) is firmly in play tonight.\n\nAlso Consider: Matt Olson, Pete Alonso\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nAledmys Diaz - Houston (at LA Angels)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Astros plan on resting most of their regular starters, so Diaz should step into a premium lineup spot. The matchup is inspiring while facing Angels\u2019 RHP Jaime Barria, who carries a vulnerable .384 wOBA split to right-handed bats. Diaz is swinging a confident bat as well, picking up nine hits with one homer, six runs, five RBIs, and a steal over his past five games. Needless to say, this is an excellent spot to continue to his heater.\n\nAlso Consider: Jurickson Profar, Ian Happ\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nJose Ramirez - Cleveland (at Chicago White Sox)\n\nRamirez missed a month of action with a broken hand, but he seems healthy after smacking three homers with eight RBIs in two games since rejoining the lineup. The Cleveland switch-hitter will look to keep the momentum against White Sox RHP Cease and his aforementioned .381 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Don\u2019t be surprised if Jose comes through for the third straight game in this series.\n\nAlso consider: Matt Chapman, Abraham Toro\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nAndrelton Simmons - LA Angels (vs. Houston)\n\nLet me start this write-up by acknowledging that Francisco Lindor and Marcus Semien are very strong plays in this slate. However, both of them are extremely expensive as well, so I\u2019ll outline a cheaper shortstop to help the rest of your lineup mesh. Andrelton Simmons will hold the platoon advantage over Houston LHP Wade Miley, and the veteran southpaw has struggled after allowing 18 earned runs through 11 innings over his past five starts. In fact, Miley has only completed more than one inning in two of those five appearances...that\u2019s how bad he\u2019s been. Simmons and company are definitely in play while the Houston lefty tries to figure things out.\n\nAlso Consider: Francisco Lindor, Marcus Semien\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nYasiel Puig - Cleveland (at Chicago White Sox)\n\nPuig is a right-handed bat, so he\u2019ll miss out on the .381 wOBA split (to LHB) of Cease. However, the trade deadline acquisition has been doing his part to keep Cleveland in the playoff picture, racking up 15 hits with five doubles, seven RBIs, and two stolen bases over his past eight games. Puig can do it all, and he\u2019s a streaky hitter who has clearly found his groove. Go ahead and look towards him on DFS sites that haven\u2019t fully adjusted for his recent performances.\n\nMichael Conforto - NY Mets (vs. Miami)\n\nSpeaking of underpriced players with respect to recent performances, Conforto has outpaced his mid-range salary with eight hits, three homers, and eight RBIs over his past three games. The Mets carry a high-end scoring projection (alongside OAK, CLE, and HOU) while facing Miami RHP Jordan Yamamoto. The Marlins\u2019 rookie is battling back from the injured list, and he allowed four or more earned runs in six of seven games prior to that. In other words, there\u2019s an opportunity for the Mets to post some runs here, and Conforto has been the main source of that lately.\n\nAlso consider: Kyle Schwarber, Oscar Mercado, Franmil Reyes, Brandon Nimmo, Ramon Laureano, Jake Marisnick (punt)", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays for the evening slate (7:05 ET) on Thursday, September 26.
