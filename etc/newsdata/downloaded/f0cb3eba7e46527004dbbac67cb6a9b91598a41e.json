This is real hope, so many people gathering on a weekday at such short notice. This is real hope to me,\u201d she said.\n\nBiggers has spent the last six months mobilizing fellow students to pressure the city council into adopting more stringent measures to address climate change.\n\n\u201cAt the time our specific goal was to get the school board to pass a climate resolution,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cBut then it was pretty easy to get the school board to get a climate resolution so we went to the city council and now we\u2019re trying to get the coal fired [power] plant shut down,\u201d he added.\n\nThe University of Iowa burns coal at its power plant, providing a clear target for the young activists who lead the crowd in regular chants of \u201cEnd Coal Now!\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be part of a global movement and especially at this stage, it\u2019s just an amazing, amazing opportunity to see a global leader,\u201d said Abbey Jordahl, a freshman at UI from Ankeny, Iowa. \u201cHonestly I couldn\u2019t believe it when I read that Greta was coming here, I was like \u2026 Iowa City?! What?! I\u2019ve been following her for a while, honestly I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Activist Greta Thunberg joins a climate strike march in Iowa City. Photograph: Daniel Acker/Reuters\n\nThunberg rallied an enthusiastic, young crowd, flush with high school and university students, many of whom had made their own signs to greet her. \u201cRight now the world leaders keep acting like children and somebody needs to be the adult in the room,\u201d she said, referencing her speech at the United Nations in New York the previous week.\n\nThunberg said afterwards that she doesn\u2019t like being the centre of attention. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get used to,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut it\u2019s something I have to do and I can\u2019t really complain. I just kind of shut off the brain,\u201d she said.\n\nExplaining why she believes she is now on the receiving end of criticism from world leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, she suggested: \u201cThey do it because they see something that is threatening and they want to silence that and if they don\u2019t have anything else to say, if they can\u2019t criticize the science, which is all we are saying, then they start attacking us personally and sending threats and hate and so on so maybe they can\u2019t cope with it.\n\n\u201cIt could definitely be they feel threatened by a new generation,\u201d she added \u201cThere is a lot of young people especially young girls in this movement who are leading and maybe they don\u2019t like that, I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nClaire Carlson, a senior studying geoscience, environmental science and business at UI from Ottumwa had joined friends from the Environmental Science Club at the rally. \u201cIts nice to finally see a large group of people come together and address the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Greta\u2019s done a really good job of bringing a voice to that especially at a really young age. I think it means that more people are starting to understand the need for impactful legislation with regards to climate change.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest More than 3,000 people gathered in the shadow of the University of Iowa on Friday afternoon to hear Thunberg speak.

Carlson favours the young mayor from South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, but Warren is the name on most people\u2019s lips when asked which way they\u2019re currently leaning.\n\n\u201cThere are still some centrists who like to play both sides on climate \u2026 such as Joe Biden,\u201d said Derek Torres who has moved to Iowa City from Atlanta. \u201cThey always speak in terms of jobs \u2026 but if there\u2019s no air or water there\u2019s no jobs,\u201d he reasoned.\n\nThunberg has become adept at using Twitter to spread her message, but does she enjoy using it? \u201cYes and no,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of it is just meaningless. And people wanting to brag about themselves or whatever, lots of hate, trolls, anonymous people who have separate accounts.\u201d But she admitted she does enjoy updating her tagline. \u201cYou need to have fun as well,\u201d she joked.", "description": "More than 3,000 people gathered in the shadow of the University of Iowa on Friday afternoon to hear Thunberg speak", "authors": ["Chris Robinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea1ff77c909f9f18e4ba94ab95e266bbdfdd7eb/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c0cacee078ed130ce60ba9259487409", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
