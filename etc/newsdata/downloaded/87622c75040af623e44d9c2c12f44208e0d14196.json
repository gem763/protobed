He thought that they would be more patient.\u201d\n\nIn She Walks With Apes, a documentary from The Nature of Things, we explore the research of these three women \u2014 Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey and Canadian Birut\u00e9 Galdikas \u2014 who were selected to observe and study primate behaviour right in the apes\u2019 jungle habitats.\n\nJane Goodall in the field as a young woman\n\nGoodall says that women may have evolved to be keen observers because they tend to play a larger role in child-rearing: \u201cTo do that well, you have to be patient, you have to be able to understand the wants and the needs of a little creature before it can talk and, also, you need to be very observant of relationships in the \u2026 family group or the tribe, because you want to keep your child away from a family member who\u2019s in a bad mood or something like that. So all of those attributes, if [this theory is] true, would tend to make women better.\u201d\n\nPrimatology is now an area of science with one of the highest proportions of female to male scientists. But it\u2019s also an area that\u2019s fraught with hardship.\n\nScientists have to spend months with the animals before they grow accustomed to a human\u2019s presence, and fieldwork is often carried out in countries that are war-torn or politically unstable. In the latter case, however, being a female researcher can have its advantages. \u201cBeing a woman helped me in practical ways,\u201d Goodall wrote in a 2018 essay for Time. \u201cWhite males were still perceived as something of a threat, whereas I as a mere woman was not.\u201d\n\nJulia Badescu is one scientist who followed in Goodall\u2019s footsteps. Today, she studies chimpanzees in Uganda. \u201cPrimatology has benefitted [in] many ways from lots of women coming into the field. Because of Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas \u2026 they set the stage for women to pursue these studies more,\u201d she says.\n\nJulia talks about how she dreamed of living in the forest with animals as a young girl.\n\nFor a long time, men were dominant in the field, and the women who worked under male supervisors often studied behaviours like killing, hunting and male dominance. Badescu says that women brought different perspectives to their study. \u201cFemale questions might tend more to female dominance ranks, understanding how females relate to each other, different strategies of females when it comes to copulations and trying to get pregnant \u2026 do they prefer to copulate with specific individuals or do they kind of copulate with everyone to confuse paternity?\u201d\n\nShe feels that to gain the most scientific perspective, other groups underrepresented in the field should become primate observers, too. \u201cWhat are the questions a disabled person might ask? What are the questions a person of colour might want to ask? Or a gay woman or man might want to ask? A lot of these are being ignored, I think.\"\n\nOf course, Badescu isn\u2019t alone in following the path of one of Leakey\u2019s three renowned researchers. By transforming the primatology, the Trimates \u2014 as Fossey, Goodall and Galdikas are known \u2014 became role models for countless young women who might not have otherwise pursued science.\n\nMORE:\n\nBaby orangutans get a second chance at life at a Borneo orphanage\n\nBirut\u00e9 Galdikas is a famous primatologist that you\u2019ve probably never heard of\n\nGaldikas, who has studied orangutans in Borneo for almost 50 years, attributes the three women\u2019s success to determination. \u201cBecause we stayed, we found out things about the great apes that would have been impossible to find out in other ways. So, I think it\u2019s that accumulation of data, of staying, that helps serve people as a role model,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cYoung men have many more role models,\u201d Galdikas continues, \u201c[and] their role models are much more diverse. You can think of first astronauts, explorers, musicians, researchers, movie directors \u2026 they're all men, at least initially, right? So, I think men have a much wider universe to choose from, while women have a much smaller universe, and that may account for why people look at us, girls look at us, as role models.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Leakey was right in his theory about women tending to be better observers in the field, his choice of the three Trimates ended up changing the study of primatology forever. And in turn, those pioneering primatologists opened doors for generations of young women.\n\nWatch She Walks with Apes on The Nature of Things.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/trimates.jpg"}
