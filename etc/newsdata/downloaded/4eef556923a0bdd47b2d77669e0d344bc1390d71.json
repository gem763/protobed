The two teams will meet in Yokohama for one of the most anticipated matches of this World Cup, hosted by Japan.\n\nFrance is the other certain semi-finalist, and they will have to face whoever wins between Japan and South Africa in Saturday afternoon's match.", "description": "England beat Australia to win through to the semi-finals of the Rugby World Cup for the first time in 12 years.", "authors": ["Viola Stefanello"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/38/94/1000x563_cmsv2_54058822-7716-5402-a39f-5034e420942f-4243894.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
