And while you might try and fight it, it\u2019s time to retire those hearty roasts and warm comfort foods for another year, and embrace something a little cooler: salads.\n\nore a riot starts, it\u2019s worth mentioning that if the idea of a salad makes you think of sad rabbit food or soggy, cheap dressing-laden iceberg lettuce, then this article was made for you. Your salad doesn\u2019t have to suck, and we\u2019re here to show you how easy it is to make one that fills you with joy \u2013 and a hearty summer meal.\n\nThe dressing\n\nThe difference between a good salad and a bad salad is one simple component: the dressing. If your version of a dressing comes from a bottle, it\u2019s time to stop. Not only are ready-made dressings full of strange ingredients that add no goodness, but they also don\u2019t taste anywhere near as good as they could. And making your own dressing truly is one of the easiest things to do, using ingredients you likely already have in your pantry.\n\nThe science behind a vinaigrette goes something like this: you\u2019ll need olive oil, an acid, an emulsifier, some kind of balancing, sweet note and seasoning. In reality, this means olive oil; your choice of either lemon juice or vinegar (like white wine, balsamic or apple cider, NOT white vinegar); a bit of wholegrain, Dijon mustard or very finely chopped garlic or shallots; honey or sugar; and salt and pepper.\n\nWhisk the vinegar or lemon juice, mustard (or garlic), honey and salt and pepper together before very slowly whisking the olive oil in. Whisk the olive oil in increments, as you need it to emulsify before you add more (you\u2019ll know it hasn\u2019t emulsified when you can see the oil separate from the vinegar mix and it will quite literally taste oily). Continue slowly whisking in the oil until you\u2019re happy with the taste and consistency. From there you can tweak anything, like adding a splash more vinegar for brightness, or softening the acidity with a touch more honey or sugar. Voil\u00e0, you\u2019ve now made a dressing.\n\nLettuce leaves\n\nNow that you\u2019ve got yourself a tasty little dressing, you need something interesting to dress. This is where you\u2019re going to step away from the iceberg lettuce and look to something with more flavour and texture. There are no rules here, as long as you don\u2019t use iceberg. You can opt for butter lettuce, kale or baby spinach or mix all of them up with basil, parsley and rocket. Like something on the bitter side? Go for radicchio or endive. If crunch is what you crave, pick up cos or baby gem.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve settled on a lettuce, make sure the leaves are easy to eat by tearing them into bite-sized pieces so that you don\u2019t need to unhinge your jaw to eat them.\n\nTexture\n\nAny salad worth its salt will have a good mix of interesting, varying textures. Lettuce plus feta and tomato might seem like a good enough combination, but we\u2019re not here for good enough, we\u2019re here for greatness. So, try adding things like roasted macadamia nuts and seeds (like sunflower or pumpkin), fresh cucumber or raw carrot or cabbage.\n\nOn the softer side of things, avo is always a welcome salad addition, but also consider a 6-minute egg, pitted olives and softer cheeses like robbiola or Danish feta.\n\nAdd-ins\n\nThere really isn\u2019t anything that can\u2019t go in your salad, so when it comes to making yours interesting, the sky is the limit. Grilled broccoli, saut\u00e9ed asparagus, peas or mange tout are great for bulking up a green salad, while you can up the protein factor with leftover roast salmon, chicken or steak. Crisp up some chickpeas and throw those in too, or add some white beans for a creamy texture. And when it comes to cheese, think beyond feta by adding shaved Parmesan, goat\u2019s cheese or torn Mozzarella.\n\nThe final flourish\n\nNow that you\u2019ve got your components ready, you don\u2019t want to mess up right at the last moment. Before adding anything to your salad, place your leaves in your bowl and give them a light sprinkle of lemon juice, olive oil and salt and pepper. If you want your lettuce leaves to have character, you need to season and dress them lightly before adding everything else.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to add the rest of the ingredients and toss everything together gently before carefully drizzling over a little dressing. Remember not to drown the salad in dressing \u2013 add it slowly, tossing carefully as you go, to ensure everything is gently coated. Then you can finish off with a flourish of cheese or toasted nuts, and tuck into the salad of your dreams.\n\nALSO READ: 25 Days of summer salad: Healthy recipes to kick-start", "description": "The perfect salad inspiration right in time for summer.", "authors": ["Jess Spiro"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7930/ad6bf14c6c264eca9f6147f7b50c754d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
