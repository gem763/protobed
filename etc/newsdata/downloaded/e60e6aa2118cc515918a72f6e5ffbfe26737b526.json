(Ben Margot)\n\nBaker Mayfield got benched on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d \u2014 and that might not have been the most humiliating thing that happened to him during his Browns\u2019 resounding loss to the 49ers.\n\n[Kyle Shanahan is getting it done in San Francisco, adding to the Redskins\u2019 embarrassment]\n\nEarlier in the game, Mayfield got sacked by San Francisco\u2019s Nick Bosa, after which the rookie defensive end exacted sweet revenge from their college days. Mimicking an infamous Mayfield moment following a 2017 win by Oklahoma over Ohio State, Bosa pretended to plant a flag into the turf at San Francisco\u2019s stadium.\n\nQuite the long play, as Nick Bosa waited 758 days to get his revenge on Baker Mayfield for planting a flag at midfield of Ohio Stadium: pic.twitter.com/rrpFxeGUdR \u2014 Andrew Lind (@AndrewMLind) October 8, 2019\n\nMayfield had done a much more literal version of the troll job after his visiting Sooners defeated Bosa\u2019s Buckeyes, 31-16, in September 2017. Mayfield, who would go on to win the Heisman Trophy that season before Cleveland made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft, ran back onto the turf with an Oklahoma flag and planted it in the large \u201cO\u201d painted on the middle of the Ohio Stadium field.\n\nIn the wake of that display, Mayfield attempted to downplay the inflammatory nature of his act, saying: \u201cI did not mean for it to be disrespectful toward any Ohio State people at all. \u2026 I got caught up in an emotional win and, yeah, it should have been something I did in the locker room, so I apologize for doing it in the middle of the field.\"\n\nBosa, this year\u2019s No. 2 overall pick, was far less apologetic in comments to reporters Monday following San Francisco\u2019s 31-3 win.\n\n\u201cHe had it coming,\u201d Bosa said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually talk,\u201d added Bosa, the younger brother of Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa, but he made an exception for his college antagonist. \u201cBaker? Baker? You good?\u201d he said he told Mayfield, to no response. \u201cCome on, pick it up. We want a challenge.\u201d\n\nHad to do Nick Bosa Baker Mayfield comparison gif pic.twitter.com/xYl6bLmNYa \u2014 Heavens! (@HeavensFX) October 8, 2019\n\nThe mock flag-planting occurred just before the first half ended Monday, and things got no better for Mayfield over the final two quarters. He ended up completing just 8 of 22 passes for 100 yards and two interceptions, and he was pulled for backup Garrett Gilbert with approximately five minutes remaining.\n\nAfterward, Mayfield claimed he was not aware of Bosa\u2019s sack celebration until he was \u201cinformed\u201d just before fielding questions at his postgame news conference.\n\n\u201cGood for him,\u201d he said of Bosa, who finished with two sacks, four quarterback hits, one forced fumble and a fumble recovery. \u201cGood play.\u201d\n\nOther NFL players thought it was a pretty good play by Bosa, as well, most notably fellow Ohio State alumni.\n\nBABY BEAR HELD IT DOWN! SALUTE! \u270a\ud83c\udffe \u2014 Darron Lee (@DLeeMG8) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cThat flag plant been bothering me for years,\u201d former Buckeyes wide receiver DeVier Posey tweeted Monday in approval.\n\nMeanwhile, Mayfield was more than bothered by Bosa and the rest of San Francisco\u2019s talented defensive line.\n\n\u201cHe was panicking,\u201d Bosa said. \u201cHe was double-clutching. Rolling back and forth.\n\n\u201cWe had him rattled all game.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPresident Trump congratulates Kirk Cousins on Vikings\u2019 win over Giants\n\nRedskins fire Coach Jay Gruden, who says he isn\u2019t bitter: \u2018I didn\u2019t get it done\u2019\n\nAnother Redskins coach fired, and his successor already is destined to fail", "description": "Flag-planting antics by the former Oklahoma quarterback following a 2017 win at Ohio State comes back to haunt Mayfield during an awful loss to Bosa's 49ers.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams", "October At Am", "Des Bieler Is A Staff Writer In Sports Who Covers A Wide Variety Of Topics", "Including Fantasy Football.
