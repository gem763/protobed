The Tower, Destiny\u2019s social space where players can collect quests from characters and store their gear, has a construction project underway. Two weeks ago, it was just scaffolding. As of this week, it\u2019s starting to look like a portal. There\u2019s a story here, and it\u2019s pretty easy to know where it\u2019s going if you\u2019ve spent this month regularly playing Destiny. But it\u2019s not the only one \u2014 and it\u2019s far from the best one.\n\nThe presumed portal being built in the Bazaar section of the Tower, behind Ikora Rey, is connected to the current season-long storyline, dubbed the Season Of The Undying. Shadowkeep\u2019s main story ends with your Guardian obtaining an artefact that\u2019s connected to most of the new problems players have to deal with in the ongoing story this season. Since the artefact communicates with The Black Garden, the birthplace of the Vex enemy faction, it\u2019s kicked off a narrative chain reaction that provided some backstory for new Destiny 2 activities.\n\nFirst, it led to the opening of a new raid, The Garden of Salvation, which coincided with Vex portals opening up on the Moon \u2014 and, subsequently, the Vex Offensive activity. All of these things \u2014 the artefact, the raid, the Vex Offensive, and this currently-under-construction portal \u2014 are all steps in an ongoing effort to understand and fight back against the Vex. What will happen when that portal is complete? We can\u2019t say for sure, but it\u2019s extremely likely that it\u2019s leading to the final scheduled event in the Season of the Undying roadmap, the Vex Offensive final assault.\n\nThe easy comparison here is Fortnite. Destiny has been adapting several ideas popularised by that game for its own use. Destiny 2\u2019s new Season Pass takes more than a few cues from Fortnite\u2019s Battle Pass, and its slow and gradual approach to environmental storytelling is similar to Fortnite\u2019s method of teasing changes coming to the game via hints in the in-game world. (It also has roots in classic MMOs, of course.) It\u2019s neat, particularly for players who might not be constantly browsing the internet for the latest news. They get to see a living game world that slowly changes as it introduces interesting new things for them to do.\n\nBut the best Destiny stories have always been in the margins, and despite the attempts to foreground some of that with these seasonal stories, the most compelling stuff is still off to the side. It\u2019s a problem that comes with abundance \u2014 Shadowkeep has introduced a bunch of plot threads that I find fascinating. I still have so many questions about what\u2019s going on with the Moon, you know? So yeah, I\u2019m going to be a little disappointed if or when the game decides to devote some time to a portion of its story that I\u2019m not so hot on, like the Vex.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the Vex are a bad place to go for interesting stories. On paper, I love them \u2014 a synthetic race of hive-mind machines that exist outside of time, causing problems in the past, present, and future all at once is my jam \u2014 it\u2019s just, as they exist in Destiny now, they\u2019re a mystery there for mystery\u2019s sake. No one knows what they want or how they work, so there\u2019s nothing to think or speculate about beyond whatever big secret Destiny lore skirts around. They don\u2019t have the strange religion of the Hive, the feudal society of the Fallen, or the extravagant and petty warmongering of the Cabal to latch on to.\n\nWhat is there focuses on the struggles of off-screen characters trying to survive the Vex. As you fight Vex hordes in the Vex Offensive or elsewhere, you\u2019ll unlock pages from a lore book called Aspect, which chronicles a Guardian named Praedyth\u2019s failed attempts to escape the Vault of Glass, the first raid from the original Destiny. It\u2019s a mind-boggling story of a man trying to hold on to his mind in a prison he cannot comprehend, working with fellow prisoners to fight their way back to freedom and, well, linear time. It\u2019s a cool thing to spend twenty minutes reading, but it\u2019s not something that makes me more interested in the Vex.\n\n\u201cPraedyth has watched from his cell for longer than he knows how to quantify, sitting inside, looking out. He\u2019s seen so many different timelines. There\u2019s no way to know which are real. From a certain point of view, they might all be.\u201d -From the entry titled \u201dEpistemic\u201d in the lore book Aspect.\n\nThe current focus on the Vex would be less frustrating if Destiny\u2019s other ongoing stories didn\u2019t feel more interesting or substantial. There\u2019s the backstory behind the weapons and armour found in the Garden of Salvation raid, which introduce a fireteam of Guardians who turned to the Darkness in rebellion against the Traveller.\n\nThere\u2019s the lore book Revelation, which delves into what happened in the Moon\u2019s K-1 Lost Sectors when a routine moon mining expedition leads to the discovery of a strange object that causes madness, resurfacing a bit of lore from a Destiny 1 multiplayer map. And there\u2019s also an increased focus on the Bray family in various lore entries.\n\nThey\u2019re the ones behind Clovis Bray, the corporation responsible for most of the human technological leaps made in the Destiny universe before the calamity that the games begin some time after. Like Weyland-Yutani of the Alien films or the Umbrella Corp from Resident Evil, the Brays are great fodder for conspiracy theories, and it\u2019s fun to pay attention whenever one of their names pop up.\n\nAll this? Way cooler than the Vex.\n\nThe problem, I suppose, is taste. In Destiny\u2019s efforts to become a more compelling, living game, its developers must choose to focus on one story above others, and since taste is subjective, different players might care about some subplots more than others. The bright side here is that live games, like TV shows, can spin stories that grow in the telling. There\u2019s always an opportunity for unexpected turns, or for seemingly unrelated threads to suddenly be tied together that might make a story I previously disliked story land really well.\n\nWith that in mind, it might be foolish to presume what that portal behind Ikora Rey really is. Sure, it\u2019s probably leading to the final assault Vex Offensive activity. But maybe it\u2019s a red herring, or a plot that will backfire horribly without any explanation whatsoever, like when Twin Peaks: The Return introduced a glass box with zero explanation, and then had a face-eating monster come out of it and murder people with just as much explanation.
