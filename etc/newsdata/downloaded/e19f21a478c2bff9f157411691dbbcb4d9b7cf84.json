Listen to songs mentioned in the book while you read on our \"Dominicana\" Spotify playlist. At the end of each month, we'll invite the author on \"GMA\" to answer your questions.\n\nMore about 'Dominicana,' by Angie Cruz\n\n\"Dominicana\" is one of those novels that will linger in your mind long after you've turned the last page. It's story of 15-year-old Ana Ruiz, who's living in New York City in the 1960s after leaving her home in the Dominican Republic. She's marrying a man twice her age in hopes of helping her family come to the U.S. someday.\n\nA coming of age story that's also a raw portrait of the immigrant experience, \"Dominicana\" is filled with heart and intensity and is sprinkled with some moments of humor. Author Angie Cruz delivers a knock-out novel that critics are calling \"an essential read for our times.\"\n\nFlatiron Books\n\nAfter Ana's husband, Juan, shows his true colors, she is ready to forget her promise to her family to help them immigrate to America and hatches a reckless plan to escape her new home in New York City. Juan's younger brother, the free-spirited C\u00e9sar, manages to stop her and convinces her to stay.\n\nAs the Dominican Republic slides into political turmoil, Juan returns to protect his family assets, leaving C\u00e9sar to take care of Ana. Suddenly, she's free to take English lessons, lie on the beach at Coney Island, go dancing with C\u00e9sar, and, most importantly, imagine a different kind of life in America. When Juan returns, Ana must decide once again between her heart and her duty to her family.\n\nInspired by her own mother's story, \"Dominicana\" is the story of one woman's journey to America and to finding herself.\n\nStart reading now with an excerpt\n\nOne kiss and suddenly I'm una mujer. Not a nina or jovencita but a woman. I touch the mirror to understand how it happened without warning, but with the hot-pink dress on, the girl who had never been kissed is gone. I am Ana, about to be married and to travel to America. Juan Ruiz is expected before noon. I look into the distorted mirror at the white lace ruffles around the neckline over and around my shoulders. The dress cinches at the waist and barely covers my knees. Juanita has blown out my hair and tied it back into a bun at the crown with ribbon upon curly ribbon, in white and pink. I put one hand on my waist, shift my hip to one side. Is that really me?\n\nIn New York I'll have a closet full of dresses and jewelry. All kinds of purses and shoes. And Juan will pay for me to go to the salon every week and get my nails done. And he'll take me to see shows and we'll go dancing with live bands. And our house will be full of his friends and family. Every day will feel like a party.\n\nMam\u00e1 walks into the room carrying her pouch of makeup. Come by the window. The light is better, she says.\n\nI kneel on the floor and lean against her knees. Hold myself up nice and tall so she can study my face.\n\nLook up, she says, and brushes mascara on my eyelashes, then blows into them to dry. She pulls the sides of my eyes and draws a line above them, leaning back for a better look.\n\nI want to see, I want to see, I say, and jump over to the mirror.\n\nSurprise! My eyes are twice as big. My lashes twice as long.\n\nMam\u00e1 pats pink cream on my cheeks and curses how dark my skin has become. Even darker after spending time with Gabriel in the pool.\n\nWhat if Gabriel sees me now? He'd probably think I'm too much woman for him.\n\nMam\u00e1 pats red lipstick on my lips and asks me to lick and spread. But Juan won't like it, I say. Just for the photo, she says. So your lips don't get lost on your face.\n\nShe takes a tissue to blot them. A trick she recently learned from a magazine. So it won't get on your teeth, she says.\n\nI go back to the mirror, thinking of all those times Teresa stole my mother's makeup and put it on to sneak out at night to meet El Guardia. I smile to show Mam\u00e1 that no lipstick got on my teeth. We all need some kind of mask.\n\nMam\u00e1 makes me sit outside on a wooden bench, under the shade of an almond tree, where it's much cooler than our house\u2014a real furnace. Teresa, Yohnny, Juanita, and Lenny are off to the beach.\n\nAna, get out of that dress, Teresa insists. El Guardia will be here any second. She's in her bathing suit, a sausage casing, under the oversize men's shirt she uses for cover.\n\nMy little brother, Lenny, already in his cutoff shorts, slaps his sweaty arm against mine. Gabriel will be there, Teresa eggs me on as if she knows about the kiss.\n\nOh the fun I will miss, I say, thinking about Mam\u00e1's warning.\n\nNot a hair out of place. Not a speck on the dress or else.\n\nOoh Gabriel, Lenny teases.\n\nI try not to blush.\n\nWhen he gave me a lift home on his bike, the feeling my mother calls the devil who steals reason came up between my legs. Without reason is how women make mistakes. Big ones, like Teresa, who got caught by the devil the day El Guardia stuck his cucumber inside her and gave her a baby Mam\u00e1 has to care for.\n\nGo, already, I tell them. Mam\u00e1'll kill me if I get up from this bench.\n\nOne time, Yohnny spoke back to her and she hit him with a broomstick so hard he lost consciousness. She did cry afterward for those three, maybe five minutes when we all thought he was dead.\n\nYou really want to go away with that old man? Teresa asks.\n\nHer tits sit on her chest like hand grenades.\n\nIt's true, Juan's old and hasn't married and has no children. This worries my mother, but he comes from hardworking people who can be trusted. And he's tall and fair, and his shoes are always polished. Besides, out of all the girls Juan could marry and take to America, he picked me.\n\nLook, Teresa, I finally say, when one's hungry no bread is too hard to eat. I have no choice.\n\nTeresa takes a small towel from her bag and pats the sweat from around my hairline and neck, her breath fresh from chewing on fennel.\n\nYou're a ghost with all this powder. And this ridiculous dress?\n\nPoor little thing.\n\nI like the dress, I mumble. All my life I wore Teresa's hand-me-downs although she is wider and shorter than me. She's probably jealous. The dress smells new, all starchy and crisp.\n\nC'mon, Ana, if the old man wants you he'll wait until we get back from the beach.\n\nEl Guardia's clunker pulls up. One of the doors has fallen off, but he has temporarily duct-taped it back to the car. Merengue blasts from his radio. He honks on the horn.\n\nYou don't have to marry him, Teresa says, extending her hands. As El Guardia revs the engine she reminds me that Gabriel is waiting for me at the beach.\n\nI touch my lips. Underneath the lipstick, I can still taste his kiss.\n\nMam\u00e1, a real mind reader, rushes out of the house and swats Teresa away with a kitchen towel.\n\nGet away from her. Why do you want to ruin Ana's life the way you ruined yours?\n\nMam\u00e1 turns to me and asks, Do you want to stay here and end up with a good-for-nothing, pigeon-toed, backward man like El Guardia, who can't even feed his own child? Or do you want to go to New York with a respectable, hardworking man so you can make something out of yourself and help your family?\n\nAt least El Guardia loves me, Teresa shouts back, loud enough to cut through the music blasting from the car.\n\nAy, love, love, love. You children don't know anything about love or survival. You live in the clouds.\n\nI can't look at either of them, so I stare at Yohnny, who's tying a goat to a tree. If he lets her loose she'll run. She looks at me with longing. I want to pet her.\n\nTeresa's feet cut the ground, her nostrils prepared to hold Mam\u00e1 back so I can make a run for it.\n\nI bite the inside of my cheek and breathe in the fresh-mown grass, the scent of lilacs and manure, of decayed mangoes fallen from the tree. I listen beyond the arguing and music for the hum- mingbirds that their wings, for the gravel under Lenny's feet, for Gabriel's breath in my ear. At least I kissed him when I had the chance.\n\nEl Guardia honks again. He knows not to step out of his car when Mam\u00e1's home. When she caught his devil eyes on Teresa, she warned El Guardia, if he stuck it into her daughter she would chop off his dick. Everyone knows Mam\u00e1 can carve a chicken blind.\n\nC'mon, Ana, stand up for yourself.\n\nTeresa pushes, although she knows my marriage agreement was sealed with hard liquor.\n\nLeave her alone! Yohnny calls out to Teresa.\n\nBully me, and I transform into an ant. I'm not like Mam\u00e1 and Teresa, who fight for every inch of land and man.\n\nYeah, leave her alone, Lenny says, and stands in front of me with his arms crossed high on his chest, knowing full well Teresa can flick him away with her pinkie.\n\nDon't worry, I say. We'll all be together in New York one day.\n\nYou'll see.\n\nAnd we'll ride the subways? Yohnny chimes in. And spickee inglis, Lenny says.\n\nOver there you'll have no one, Teresa says. No family. No one to protect you. She presses her forehead against mine, our sweat gluing us to each other.\n\nYohnny karate-kicks the air and splits us apart.\n\nI'll protect you, he says. I'll fly there and kick whoever's ass. A man's heart in a child's body, that's Yohnny.\n\nI hold back from laughing, to not upset Mam\u00e1. She counts on me to follow through on this.\n\nStop it, Teresa. I don't want to go to the beach, okay!\n\nTeresa rolls her eyes and hugs me as if it's the last time I'll ever see her.\n\nMam\u00e1's so proud of me. Finally I've accepted what she knows is the only answer for me.\n\nEnough already. Mam\u00e1 waves them away. Leave now. I'd rather Juan not see you hooligans being such a bad influence on Ana, Mam\u00e1 says.\n\nLenny and Yohnny whoop and holler their way back to El Guardia's car. They slide into the backseat through the open window and stick their arms out, waving good-bye.\n\nYou're just like Pap\u00e1, Teresa says, who lets Mam\u00e1 boss him around.\n\nBut even she knows this marriage is bigger than me. Juan is the ticket for all of us to eventually go to America.\n\nThe sun bites hard into one side of my face. I try to think of the beach, of the way the waves crash against the rocks, the fun to be had. Of Gabriel and the keys he carries in his pocket. The way he traced my body, his eyes like fingers. I had memorized the ends of his tight curls, his skin an orange-brown glow, as if someone had lit a candle inside of him.\n\nAll morning, my father rocks on his chair and smokes his pipe. My mother pokes her head out the kitchen window checking on me, smiling and waving. All her hopes and dreams tie into me. And as if to show me my good fortune\u2014to sit, do nothing in my new dress\u2014she bosses Juanita and Betty to fetch some yucca and batata out back, to wash the sheets, to feed the chickens, and to mop the floors, muddied from yesterday's thundershower.\n\nYou so lucky, they say. Unlike them, I've never fantasized about going to New York. They track every dollar bill mentioned in passing conversation and gossip about every American hair clip, pair of shoes, or dresses worn by girls in the area who tease men like Juan in exchange for gifts and opportunity. They all hope for a proper proposal to get to a place where even country girls like us become glamorous and rich.\n\nIf there was time Pap\u00e1 would've killed a goat and invited everyone in the area to celebrate my departure. Mam\u00e1 would've piled the pl\u00e1tanos and chayote on one serving tray, yucca covered in red onions on another. Yohnny would've shared his brew of mamajuana to get everyone loose. The house would've been full with neighbors and family. One sip of mamajuana, and I'd be digging my feet into the dirt in my backyard to the beats of the drum and the scraping of the g\u00fcira. And Gabriel would've tried to keep his distance out of respect for Juan. But Teresa would've made him dance with me.\n\nWhat could a kid like Gabriel ever do for me?\n\nAnd yet we would spin and spin around as if we could turn back time. Stop it somehow.\n\nOh, I want to be grateful for my fortune. But I don't want to leave our house in Los Guayacanes painted the color of buttercups by my late grandfather, the only house for miles that has survived all the hurricanes. Our house, the one I share with my parents, Yohnny, Lenny, Teresa, Juanita, and Betty, where there is everything I know and can imagine, for all of my life.\n\nFrom \"Dominicana\" by Angie Cruz.
