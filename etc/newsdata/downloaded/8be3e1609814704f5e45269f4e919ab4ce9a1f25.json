It was one of the few opportunities Boca had in the entire match.\n\nRiver Plate advanced to the final of the Copa Libertadores after seeing off arch rivals Boca Juniors 2-1 on aggregate\n\nDespite losing 1-0 on the night, River prevented their rivals from overcoming a two-goal deficit to advance to the final\n\nRiver will now compete for their fifth South American crown in the final in Santiago on November 23, although question marks remain over the host's ability to host the final next month.\n\nStreet protests against transportation rises have rocked the Chilean capital, but South America's football body CONMEBOL said it does not have an alternate plan for the Copa Libertadores decider.\n\nRiver's opponent will be known on Wednesday, when Brazil's Flamengo hosts Gremio at the historic Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. The first leg between the two Brazilian sides ended 1-1.\n\nGremio were involved in a captivating tie with River in last year's semifinals, in which the Argentinians only advanced with a goal from the spot at 86 minutes in their 2-1 away win in Porto Alegre.\n\nTuesday's result was another setback for Boca who had looked to get their revenge on their arch rivals following last season's loss in the final in Madrid.\n\nJuan Carlos Hurtado of Boca gave fans hope with ten minutes remaining as he drew one goal back in the second leg\n\nFormer West Ham striker Mauro Zarate looks to inspire fans to chant Boca on as they searched for the all important equaliser\n\nIt was a closely fought contest at La Bombonera Stadium between last year's finalists as they both looked to advance\n\nThe stats don't make for good reading for Boca fins.

'We searched for our goal at all times, we took risks. Now we feel this result was unfair,' he said.\n\nThe only incident that caused some tension in the match at La Bombonera was a 15-minute delay because of paper thrown by Boca fans onto the pitch. Before the second leg of the 2018 final, River fans threw rocks at a bus with the players of their archrivals and hurt several of them hours before the match.
