The Rams have revealed Keogh was among those who continued drinking after a team-building dinner with staff on Tuesday evening.\n\n'As a club, we cannot, and do not, condone the actions of a small group of players on Tuesday evening,' Derby said in a statement. 'The players were out as part of a scheduled team-building dinner with staff and while the majority of them acted responsibly and left at around 8pm and were not involved, a small group, including the team captain Richard Keogh, continued drinking into the night. They should have known when to stop and also ignored the opportunity to be driven home using cars laid on by the club, and chose to stay out.'", "description": "Derby have condemned an 'alcohol-related incident' that has led to captain Richard Keogh being ruled out until the end of the season", "authors": ["Source"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dff4de4f7ca730a22d081ef5879e1abd1dcaf70b/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7cb8ea0a36e4b0b5db890cc624300ca6", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
