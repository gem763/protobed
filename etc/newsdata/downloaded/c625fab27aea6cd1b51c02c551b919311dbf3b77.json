Sets IPO at 10 Million Shares; Sees Pricing at $14-$16 Each", "language": "en", "text": "By Colin Kellaher\n\nProgyny Inc., a benefits-management company backed by private-equity firm TPG Inc., on Tuesday said it expects to sell 6.7 million shares at $14 to $16 apiece in its initial public offering.\n\nAt the $15 midpoint of that range, the New York company focused on fertility and family-building benefits said it expects net proceeds of about $91 million.\n\nCertain shareholders, including Germany's Merck KGaA (MRK.XE), are selling another 3.3 million shares in the IPO, for a total offering of 10 million shares, Progyny said.\n\nProgyny will have about 82.2 million shares outstanding after the IPO, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for a market capitalization of roughly $1.23 billion at the $15-a-share midpoint.\n\nTPG, which isn't selling any shares, will own about 25% of Progyny after the offering.\n\nWrite to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 15, 2019 11:22 ET (15:22 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
