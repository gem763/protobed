Smoke from the front line, marking their battle against Islamic State, which launched an assault on northern Iraq last summer, is visible from the base.\n\nReuters photographer Asmaa Waguih spent time with the women who have taken up arms.\n\nA fighter adjusts her scarf while another carries a picture of jailed Kurdish militant leader Abdullah Ocalan. As the pickup truck carrying the soldiers passed by the winding road on Mount Sinjar, northwest Iraq, a child on the roadside cheered the soldiers and raised his hands with the V-sign. He chanted, \"Biji Scrok Apo\", Kurdish for, \"Long live Apo,\" referring to the jailed Kurdish militant leader Abdullah Ocalan. Islamic State militants overpowered Kurdish forces in the Sinjar area of Iraq last August and proceeded to purge its Yazidi population - an ancient, predominantly Kurdish people who follow their own religion - killing hundreds and taking thousands captive.\n\nI had asked to go to Mount Sinjar because I knew there were Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant bases there and that women would be among the fighters. They were very kind and welcoming towards me but they had work to do.\n\nEver since the Islamic State took over Mount Sinjar and declared its cross-border caliphate last year, many minority Yazidis have joined forces with PKK fighters and Kurdish peshmerga fighters from Iraqi Kurdistan who defended their lands. Grateful to the Kurds, many Yazidis decided to join with them to fight Islamic State and free the rest of Sinjar.\n\nFighter stand near a position hit by Islamic State car bombs. I didn't make it to the front line, which marks the battle against Islamic State, but I could see it from Mount Sinjar.\n\nMale and women fighters worked together, side by side. All of the fighters, whether women or men, don\u2019t get married, choosing to sacrifice their personal lives for the cause they believe in. Many women I met were from families who were staunch supporters of the PKK, often with other members joining up. The fighters were willing to give up having a family of their own to defend their land, dying in the process if necessary.\n\nHaval Raperin, a member and leader of a group of PKK fighters combs her hair. Some of the women had cut links with home. The fighters came from different parts of Kurdistan but spoke a common dialect of Kurdish so they could understand each other. They addressed each other as \u201ccomrade\u201d and it was clear that they supported each other in whatever challenge they faced.\n\nA displaced Yazidi family, including a fighter, who live in tents nearby, chant slogans as a military convoy carrying the body of a Yazidi fighter passes by. These women and their male counterparts are an example of what some may see as an extreme example of patriotism. They are very organised and strong-minded women. It makes me feel that being a Kurd is something very unique. You always have another language and country that are part of your identity, while dreaming of a land of your own: an ideal that you\u2019ll defend, come what may.\n\n1 / 23 Slideshow Fighters adjust a machine gun as they prepare to join others near a position which has been hit by Islamic State car bombs.
