(CBLT Newshour/CBC Archives)\n\nAccording to the Toronto Star, the building's management had identified beer sales as a new revenue stream that would boost the bottom line by $2 million to $3 million per year.\n\nTeam President Cliff Fletcher told the newspaper that fans were unlikely to swallow a hike in ticket prices, making beer an attractive alternative.\n\n\"We're the last of the dry buildings in North America,\" he later told the CBC.\n\nUntil June that year, an Ontario law restricted sales of beer at sports stadiums.\n\nBut the Toronto Blue Jays had been free to sell beer at games since 1982, first at Exhibition Stadium and later at SkyDome, which had opened three years earlier and enjoyed a special exception from the provincial legislature.\n\nCity council had a say\n\nResidents living near the arena object to the potential for problems if beer becomes available. 1:35\n\nSkyDome was far from any residential area at the time, but the same did not apply to the Gardens.\n\nAnd that was the basis of \"community concern\" that was the topic of a Toronto city council meeting on Sept. 25, 1992.\n\n\"There must be a few places in Canada, and in Toronto, where parents can take their kids and not have liquor sold,\" said Coun. Kay Gardner.\n\nSome people living near the Gardens were leery of the impact beer sales would have on people leaving the game.\n\n\"If you add alcohol, it will only lead to greater rowdyism and noise, which will no doubt have an adverse effect on the neighbourhood,\" said Ian Stuart of the local residents' association.\n\nBeer still not near\n\nToronto city councillor Kay Gardner said she didn't want Maple Leaf Gardens to become a \"drinking palace.\" (CBLT Newshour/CBC Archives)\n\nGardens management assured councillors it would take steps to mitigate any problems, such as cutting off sales for the third period and hiring four off-duty police officers to assist with crowd control.\n\n\"That satisfied the committee, which voted 6-1 in favour of the plan,\" said reporter John Northcott.\n\nBut the full city council still had to approve the plan, as did the provincial liquor board.\n\n\"The Gardens management is optimistic they'll be able to serve beer there sometime in October,\" said Northcott.\n\nThe first beer at a Toronto Maple Leafs game was poured on Jan. 30, 1993.", "description": "Management at Maple Leaf Gardens hoped to be able to sell beer in time for the start of the 1992-93 hockey season.
