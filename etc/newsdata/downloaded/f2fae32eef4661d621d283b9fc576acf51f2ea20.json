Skinner. In it, Davis chastised FEC Chair Ellen L. Weintraub for using government time and resources for \u201cideological, and at times, political, purposes.\u201d He recounted four instances where Weintraub had used FEC resources to publish her personal opinions on President Trump.\n\nIn a February 2017 statement issued on FEC letterhead, Weintraub requested the president show evidence of \"alleged voter fraud in New Hampshire,\" a reference to Trump\u2019s claim that illegal voting had cost him the state's four electoral votes in the 2016 presidential election. In a March follow-up letter, Weintraub reiterated that request.\n\nIn May 2017, Weintraub wrote a statement, again on FEC letterhead, rebuking Trump for his creation of an Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, saying: \u201cMr. President, take responsibility for your words. Document them if you can. Apologize to them if you have to. But don\u2019t ship them off to a commission.\u201d\n\nFEC CHAIR: TRUMP IS 'DAMAGING TO OUR DEMOCRACY' WITH 'BASELESS' VOTER FRAUD ALLEGATIONS\n\nWeintraub wrote a second letter to Trump about his New Hampshire voter fraud claims in August 2019 in a tone Davis described as \u201cpartisan snark.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put it in terms a former casino operator should understand: There comes a time when you need to lay your cards on the fable or fold,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe letter was not hosted on the FEC website, but was drafted with the agency\u2019s letterhead and appeared on Weintraub\u2019s Twitter feed, according to Davis.\n\nDavis also criticized Weintraub for appearances on CNN and MSNBC to \u201cdiscuss matters outside the purview of the FEC.\u201d On at least two occasions, Weintraub dismissed Trump\u2019s claims as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d that are \u201cdamaging to our democracy.\u201d\n\nDavis argued that Weintraub had violated the FEC\u2019s nonpartisan position by failing to indicate \u201cin any interview that she was speaking as a private citizen and not as Chair of the nonpartisan FEC.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBecause of her ostensible bias against President Trump, Weintraub \u201cshould publicly admit her political differences with the President, disclose her conflict of interest, and at the very least, recuse herself from voting on Matters Under Review involving the President,\u201d Davis wrote.\n\nResponding to Davis\u2019 memo via Twitter, Weintraub wrote she would \u201cnot be silenced\u201d and that the \u201cindependence of the United States Federal Election Commission will not be compromised.\u201d\n\nReached out to for comment, Weintraub directed Fox News to the tweet.", "description": "The top Republican on the House Committee on House Administration\u00a0the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) inspector general\u00a0on Thursday to investigate the agency\u2019s leader\u00a0for allegedly using her position to publicly disparage President Trump.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
