It will also discontinue handgun sales in Alaska, marking its complete exit from handguns and allowing it to focus on hunting rifles and related ammunition only.\n\n\u201cWe have a long heritage as a company of serving responsible hunters and sportsmen and women, and we\u2019re going to continue doing so,\u201d according to a memo by Walmart\u2019s CEO, Doug McMillon, that will be circulated to employees on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWalmart is further requesting that customers refrain from openly carrying firearms at its stores unless they are law enforcement officers. Last month, a gunman entered a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, and killed 22 people using an AK-style firearm whose sale Walmart already bans. Texas became an open-carry state in 2016, allowing people to openly carry firearms in public.\n\nRadical gun reform may finally have a voice in Washington Read more\n\nWalmart\u2019s moves will reduce its market share of ammunition from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%, according to Tuesday\u2019s memo. About half of its more than 4,000 US stores sell firearms.\n\nThe country\u2019s largest retailer has been facing increasing pressure to change its gun policies by gun control activists, employees and politicians after the El Paso shooting and an unrelated shooting in Dayton, Ohio, that killed nine people. A few days before that, two Walmart workers were killed by another worker at a store in Southaven, Mississippi.\n\nIn the aftermath of the El Paso shooting, Walmart ordered workers to remove video game signs and displays that depict violence from stores nationwide. But that fell well short of demands for the retailer to stop selling firearms entirely. Critics have also wanted Walmart to stop supporting politicians backed by the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe retailer has long found itself in an awkward spot with its customers and gun enthusiasts. Many of its stores are located in rural areas where hunters depend on Walmart to get their equipment. Walmart is trying to walk a fine line by seeking to embrace its hunting heritage while being a more responsible retailer.\n\nWith its new policy on open carry, McMillon noted in his memo that individuals have tried to make a statement by carrying weapons into its stores just to frighten workers and customers. But he added that there are well-intentioned customers acting lawfully who have also inadvertently caused a store to be evacuated and local law enforcement to be called to respond.\n\nHe said Walmart will continue to treat \u201claw-abiding customers with respect\u201d and it will have a \u201cnon-confrontational approach\u201d.\n\nWalmart says it hopes to use its weight to help other retailers by sharing its best practices such as software that it uses for background checks. And the company, which in 2015 stopped selling assault weapons like the AR rifles used in several mass shootings, urged more debate on the reauthorization of the assault weapons ban. McMillon says Walmart will send letters to the White House and the congressional leadership that calls for action on these \u201ccommon sense\u201d measures.\n\n\u201cIn a complex situation lacking a simple solution, we are trying to take constructive steps to reduce the risk that events like these will happen again,\u201d McMillon wrote in his memo. \u201cThe status quo is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) was swift to criticize the retailer\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is shameful to see Walmart succumb to the pressure of the anti-gun elites,\u201d it said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nOver the last 15 years, Walmart had expanded beyond its hunting and fishing roots, carrying items like assault rifles in response to increasing demand. But particularly since 2015, often coinciding with major public mass shootings, the company has made moves to curb the sale of ammunition and guns.\n\nWalmart announced in February 2018 that it would no longer sell firearms and ammunition to people younger than 21 and also removed items resembling assault-style rifles from its website. Those moves were prompted by the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people.\n\nIn 2015, Walmart stopped selling semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15-style rifle, the type used in the Dayton shooting. The retailer also does not sell large-capacity magazines, handguns (except in Alaska) or bump stocks, nor the AK-style firearm that was used by the El Paso shooter.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Walmart stopped selling handguns with the exception of Alaska.", "description": "Company to ask shoppers not to openly carry firearms, even where legal, after series of mass shootings", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091b9a528010f2f020c2b14a020b0348d6f4ed81/0_36_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=336c207c69ef24ad01f5ad1e4f3961b5"}
