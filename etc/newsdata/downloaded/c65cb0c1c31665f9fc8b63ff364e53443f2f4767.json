Blanchard has been covering sustainability and ethics in the industry since the eighties. Previously in charge of fashion editorial at the Independent, the Observer and the Telegraph magazine, she has made a career writing insightful features on style and our - sometimes conflicted - relationship with it.\n\nWe sat down for a cup of tea, a couple of days after the launch of her latest book 100 women, 100 styles (Laurence King, 2019) to chat about inspiring women and her journey from catwalk reporter to fervent advocate for transparency in the fashion supply chain. Not forgetting of course, her exclusive insights into personal style and how to find it.\n\nFrida Kahlo, Cara Delevingne, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the punk princesses, the pioneers, the silver screen goddesses - the Cleopatras - which is one of my favourite chapters,\u201d Blanchard explains as she lays out the structure of her new book. \u201cIt\u2019s a hundred women who changed the way we look. I was really keen on the fact that it was women who had done something, but also had really interesting individual style.\u201d From Frida Kahlo to Cara Delevingne, the book works like a who\u2019s who of the most iconic female personalities of the 20th and 21st century.\n\n100 women, 100 styles (Laurence King, 2019) - Lupita Nyong'o Tamsin Blanchard\n\n\u201cIf you look at someone like Georgia O'Keeffe, she had a style and she wore the same things over and over again, as women did in the past. You would have a set of clothes, you would mend them, look after them, and they would become your signature. I thought that was really interesting and worth celebrating.\u201d Blanchard tells me. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of sustainability ingrained in this whole idea of finding your style and keeping with it. You have a wardrobe full of clothes you love and have a resonance with.\u201d she adds.\n\nSustainability. You don\u2019t have to spend much time with Tamsin Blanchard before the word in question is raised. This is because she\u2019s a pioneer, having covered the fashion industry from a socio-political and cultural point of view for the Independent way before everyone else. \u201cI liked the idea that you could use fashion to express who you are, what your opinions are, your political leanings even. I was very anti-fur. I realised that fashion was a political issue. I then started to look into social and environmental aspects of the industry.\u201d she recalls.\n\n\u201cI was really interested in brands like Patagonia who had just started making fleece out of PET plastic bottles. This, to me, was a story that seemed far more interesting than what was going on on the catwalks.\u201d she says.\n\n100 women, 100 styles (Laurence King, 2019) - Bjork Tamsin Blanchard\n\nRana Plaza and Fashion Revolution\n\nWhat radically changed the course of her journey was the Rana Plaza incident. On 24th April 2013, the Bangladesh factory collapsed, killing 1,127 garment workers and sparking outrage worldwide. Blanchard was Fashion Features Director of the Telegraph at the time and remembers it as a clear \u201cwake-up call\u201d. \u201cThe fact that the factory knew there were cracks in the walls, and the workplace was unsafe, marked the point when people started to realise there was something really wrong going on in this industry,\u201d she explains.\n\nSoon after, she joined Fashion Revolution - a global movement working towards raising awareness of poor conditions in factories and garment workers\u2019 rights - led by Orsola de Castro and Carry Somers. \u201cIt was an opportunity for me to use my knowledge and my contacts. My skills as a writer were used to help promote the fashion revolution campaign,\u201d she says.\n\nSo, where are we now? I ask. \u201cThe fashion industry has become quite polarised in a way. Luckily, there\u2019s a whole new generation of designers coming out who would no longer consider creating a brand without sustainability at its core. They understand about the importance of transparency in the supply chain, being open about what they\u2019re doing, and sharing advice on best practice.That\u2019s really a massive shift\u201d, Blanchard explains.\n\nThe science of personal style\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a huge change in the way citizens think about the clothes they buy. It\u2019s very much been led by the food industry. People are realising that they actually have a choice, and increasingly are going for the better option,\u201d she adds. Finding and refining one\u2019s own personal style plays a significant role in being a more sustainable shopper. Hence, a book like '100 women, 100 styles' aims at providing female readers with visual inspirations and nudging them in the right direction.\n\n100 women, 100 styles (Laurence King, 2019) Tamsin Blanchard\n\n\u201cI think a really good place to start is a charity shop, because you are then confronted with a rail of diverse clothes where you can find something that you\u2019re personally drawn to. Choose things that you love, not that have been marketed at you, and maybe don\u2019t really suit you. I think it does take some time. Listen to your friends who often have really honest opinions, go to clothes swaps, and explore your own style in a way that\u2019s not going to cost a fortune either,\u201d Blanchard concludes with a smile.\n\nTamsin Blanchard's news book, 100 women, 100 styles (Laurence King, 2019), is available to buy now.\n\nFind out more about Fashion Revolution and how to join the cause on their website.", "description": "Eminent journalist Tamsin Blanchard tells us all about how to start a fashion revolution.", "authors": ["Ines Fressynet"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/43/66/1000x563_cmsv2_0dae3d29-5a2e-5173-af3d-b954406da73e-4234366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
