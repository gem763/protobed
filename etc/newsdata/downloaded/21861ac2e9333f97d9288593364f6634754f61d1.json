Microsoft was awarded the contract in an upset last Friday, on Monday the stock soared to a new record.\n\nAccording to the military issues web site Task & Purpose, former Defense Secretary James Mattis was directed by the president to \"screw Amazon.\" Task & Purpose reported this story in \"Holding The Line: Inside Trump's Pentagon with Secretary Mattis\" a new book from Penguin Random House written by former Mattis speechwriter and communications director Guy Snodgrass.\n\nAMAZON MAY BECOME BIGGEST NATIONAL SECURITY PLAYER\n\nTask & Purpose obtained an advanced copy of the book. FOX Business has not yet seen a copy.\n\nBeyond the book, President Trump has routinely tossed barbs at Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos who also owns The Washington Post, which has often reported unfavorable stories about the Trump Administration.
