As the name implies, there were armchairs, a coffee table and shelves stacked with books. There was even a roaring fire.\n\nDuring the course of the conversation, I asked the man who trained to meditate for up to 16 hours what he might recommend for someone to get started on the path to mindfulness right away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe gives me two answers.\n\n\u2018Pick one activity during your day \u2013 that might be having a cup of coffee or reading the paper \u2013 and do it without doing anything else at the same time.\n\n\u2018That might mean you don\u2019t look at your phone while you drink the coffee. Just put it down and focus on doing one thing without any distraction.\u2019\n\nSo, I put it to you to see if you can focus on this article without any distractions. Ignore your notifications or avoid clicking on another browser tab. You\u2019ll have taken the first step towards mindfulness and I\u2019ll tell you at the end of the article what Andy\u2019s second technique is.\n\nMeanwhile, if you\u2019re not familiar with Headspace, let me fill you in.\n\nHeadspace is accessed through an app and aims to make meditation more accessible to people (Headspace)\n\nThe app is part of a wider company devoted to digital health and making mindfulness more accessible. Initially, that\u2019s through guided meditation but there are other avenues, such as movement and nutrition, to consider as well.\n\nHeadspace \u2013 through Andy\u2019s narration \u2013 guides you through different techniques and while there\u2019s a free tier, you have to subscribe and pay a monthly fee of \u00a39.99 to keep accessing the new content. You can cut the monthly price in half if you sign up for a year at a time.\n\n\u2018I get called an overnight success, but it\u2019s taken 11 years,\u2019 Andy tells Metro.co.uk. A Bristol native, Puddicombe moved to the US to start Headspace with his co-founder Rich Pierson. Now he lives in LA with his wife and kids and Headspace employs 300 people in LA, San Francisco, New York and London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe app is pushing beyond just a subscription service on our smartphones. It\u2019s currently about halfway through the FDA approval process in the US which will allow doctors to prescribe it to patients \u2013 therefore sidestepping the need to pay for a subscription as it will be covered by health insurance.\n\nThe app uses animations and narration from Andy himself (Headspace)\n\n\u2018Things like mental health and emotional wellbeing are the disease states we go after. And the common wisdom is meditation is only for mental diseases, like anxiety for example,\u2019 Andy says. \u2018And yes, while there\u2019s definitely a place for that, we\u2019re also seeing a huge impact on physical ailments as well. Things like migraines or high blood pressure can be treated with meditation.\u2019\n\nIndeed, Headspace the company is split into three distinct areas: the consumer channel (the app), business-to-business (corporate wellness schemes) and healthcare (the aforementioned FDA process).\n\nThe drive into corporate and healthcare is an obvious one \u2013 it\u2019s easy to write mindfulness off as some kind of pseudo-profound. But Andy tells me that 10 days of Headspace usage will improve focus by 14% \u2013 something anyone can try for free using the app.\n\nHe defines focus as committing to any task, whether mental or physical, without distraction.\n\nBut why is focus so hard to begin with?\n\n\u2018Meditation existed 2,500 years ago,\u2019 Andy explains. \u2018What\u2019s happening now is that we\u2019re amplifying the noise and the distraction.\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s not telling us anything we don\u2019t already know here. The bombardment of digital information \u2013 whether that\u2019s 24/7 news, social media posts or the call of a new Netflix series \u2013 is leaving us both wired and stressed.\n\nWhen I mention that Generation Z (those typically born between the mid-90s and mid-2000s) won\u2019t ever know a world without these things, Andy gets circumspect. He says that we won\u2019t know the true effect of the Information Age for at least a generation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Stuff is happening in schools right now,\u2019 he says, \u2018it\u2019s coming from a generation who better understand the need for concern around this kind of thing.\u2019\n\nThe company has a Headspace for Educators program that offers free access to the service for teachers, school administrators and support staff. It has partnered directly with over 168 schools in the UK since 2015.\n\nAs the company puts it: \u2018Headspace believes that if we can help educators build resilience, improve sleep quality, mitigate stress and foster mindfulness in their classrooms \u2013 the impact on the next generation will be immeasurable.\n\n\u2018We want to not only help Educators build their own healthy routines, but offer guidance and support to easily integrate Headspace into their classrooms in the most thoughtful, validated and relevant way.\n\n\u2018To do this, we\u2019re leveraging our authentic expertise, our full content library, our brand and techniques.\u2019\n\nOf course, Headspace delivers digital content to you through a smartphone \u2013 just like Netflix, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook or any other digital service competing for our attention. So is it just part of the same problem?\n\nAndy is willing to talk about his relationship with the smartphone as a piece of tech before I\u2019ve even gotten a question out.\n\n\u2018A phone is just a piece of metal and plastic,\u2019 he says emphatically.\n\n\u2018It can\u2019t do anything on its own, but in most cases people have it optimised for distraction.\u2019\n\nAt this point, he picks up his iPhone from the coffee table in front of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis homescreen is Zen personified.\n\nIt\u2019s only got a couple of rows of icons on it and is refreshingly free from notifications.\n\n\u2018The only red dot I ever see is the one from settings telling me there\u2019s an update,\u2019 he tells me.\n\nIt may seem inconsequential but rearranging how your phone works may go a long way to helping you check it less often. And while Andy does have to use social media for his work \u2013 posting updates to his followers or responding to questions about Headspace \u2013 he does it fleetingly and with purpose.\n\nAndy now lives in LA with his wife and two kids (Headspace)\n\nSo, what does someone who has lived in 10-15 different countries over the course of his life (not to mention co-creating an internationally-recognised brand) feel about the state of the world in 2019?\n\n\u2018I believe in people having different viewpoints but I think we\u2019re losing the ability to listen. We\u2019re losing the art of talking about meaningful things,\u2019 he tells me.\n\n\u2018However, I also feel everything is quite cyclical in nature. So while the world may feel divisive at the moment, I have great optimism. I know things will change.\u2019\n\nHe reiterates that all of his success has come from a simple mission of wanting to bring mindfulness and meditation to a wider audience and promote it as a way to tackle a variety of problems. And getting started with it is simple \u2013 if you\u2019ve made it this far without checking your phone or getting distracted then congratulations.\n\nAs promised, Andy\u2019s one other simple tip for getting into mindfulness was to take a minute \u2013 just 60 seconds \u2013 to make yourself comfortable, close your eyes, settle your hands on your stomach and just listen to your breath inhaling and exhaling.\n\nGive it a try for yourself and see what happens.
