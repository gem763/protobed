Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2019\n\nThe higher tariffs appear to present only increased trade risk to the U.S. economy, a risk that Powell acknowledged in July as a key reason for needing an \u201cinsurance\u201d cut of 25 basis points.\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams acknowledged in early September that Chinese trade concerns have led to \u201cangst\u201d among U.S. businesses pulling back on investment. Weaker manufacturing numbers have also shown tangible impacts on the U.S. economy as a result of the trade war.\n\n\u201cOn our own shores, concerns around trade policy with China are adding to an uncertain picture,\u201d Williams said September 4.\n\nThe geopolitical picture globally has darkened, as well. The European Central Bank moved last week to counter continued weakness in the Eurozone with more stimulus. In China, weaker industrial production has extended worries of a slowdown.\n\nComplicating things further were developments on the Arabian peninsula this weekend, where a drone attack on a Saudi Arabian crude-processing center triggered a sharp spike in oil prices.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Matthew Luzzetti said a spike in oil prices should \u201creinforce the Fed\u2019s already dovish bias.\u201d Luzzetti wrote Sept. 16 that higher energy prices should not dramatically change the Fed\u2019s concerns over the persistent undershooting of its 2% inflation target, since its preferred measure of prices (core personal consumption expenditures) is an inflation reading that strips out oil prices.\n\n\u201cBarring a more substantial geopolitical flare-up that leads to a sharp tightening of financial conditions, this move in oil should have only modest effects on the US economy,\u201d Luzzetti wrote.\n\nHow robust is the US?\n\nAs a result of increased global weakness and trade tensions, many expect Powell to repeat his talking points on July\u2019s \u201cinsurance\u201d cut in justifing another 25 basis point cut Wednesday.\n\nBut why not 50 basis points?\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee already has a rift between policymakers favoring accommodation and the two voters that do not (Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George).", "description": "A spike in oil prices and escalating trade tensions are among the many news developments weighing on the Federal Reserve as it announces its next policy-setting decision on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Brian Cheung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZYG4wCMhEki4qpkXQoyeGg--~B/aD0zNDI5O3c9NTE0MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/839063e0-b467-11e9-bfbf-6e3bf6cb352c", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
