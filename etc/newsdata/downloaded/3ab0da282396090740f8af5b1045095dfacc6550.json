Here a selection of them speak about their priorities\n\nThey took gap years to stay at home and run for office. They list as their political heroes progressive leaders such as Jacinda Ardern and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And they plan to juggle their new roles as elected officials with university exams and shifts at McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe record number of young New Zealanders, some still in their teens, who surged to victory in the country\u2019s local government elections on Saturday \u2013 in what was dubbed a \u201cyouthquake\u201d by commentators \u2013 were not lured by dreams of high-profile posts in national politics.\n\nInstead, they ran for roles on New Zealand\u2019s city and district councils or community boards \u2013 where elected officials have always tended to be older, white and male, and where elections have been treated with apathy by voters of all ages.\n\nChristchurch attack: New Zealand tries new tactic to disrupt online extremism Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about representing our planet and representing a whole group of people who aren\u2019t currently strongly being heard around the council table,\u201d says Sophie Handford, 18, who was the youngest to be elected on Saturday, winning a seat on the lower North Island\u2019s K\u0101piti coast district council.\n\n\u201cObviously our planet doesn\u2019t have a physical voice,\u201d she says. \u201cI see the extreme importance of raising issues related to the planet and our climate at all levels.\u201d\n\nInspired by the climate change activism of the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, Handford took a gap year after she finished high school in 2018 to lead New Zealand\u2019s school student strikes over inaction on global heating. Her progressive agenda included boosting mental health support and tackling youth homelessness.\n\nThe so-called \u201cyouthquake\u201d in Saturday\u2019s election did not reflect a large boost in overall voter turnout. Preliminary figures showed 44% of New Zealanders cast ballots \u2013 just two percentage points higher than at the 2016 local government elections.\n\nYouth voting figures were not available on Wednesday. But the number of elected officials under 30 doubled according to preliminary figures, from 14 to 30 after the ballot, and the cohort under 40 increased by a half, to 91 from 59 last election. In previous local government elections, more than 90% of those elected were over 40.\n\nThe number of women elected also grew \u2013 from 19% of the country\u2019s mayors in 2016 to 25% in Saturday\u2019s poll.\n\nOn Monday, Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s Labour prime minister, noted the increase. \u201cIt certainly seems a bent of environmentalism across the country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me that there was actually quite a bit of change in these elections.\u201d\n\n\u2018Put your hand up and get into it\u2019\n\nOn Saturday afternoon in Rotorua, a lakeside town in the North Island, Fisher Wang, 19, has just finished his shift at McDonald\u2019s when he learned that taking a gap year to run for office had also paid off for him.\n\nA few weeks before he was due to leave home for university this year, he says \u201cthis thought came into my head\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was like, Fisher, is that really what you want to do? Do you really want to go and study law and do all that for the rest of your life?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fisher Wang was \u2018starstruck\u2019 when Jacinda Ardern called him. Photograph: Supplied\n\nMeeting Ardern during her 2017 election campaign \u201creally fuelled the fire\u201d to get involved in politics, says Wang, who hopes to champion environmental and youth issues as a Rotorua Lakes councillor. He was \u201cstarstruck\u201d when the prime minister rang to congratulate him after Saturday\u2019s result.\n\n\u201cShe talked about her journey into politics,\u201d he says. \u201cThe advice she gave me was to enjoy it, put your hand up and get into it.\u201d\n\nWang says he will continue to work at McDonald\u2019s on his days off, adding that it was a good opportunity to hear from his constituents.\n\nFeedback while hitchhiking\n\nAnother successful candidate who said victory would not change his habits was the new mayor of the South Island city of Dunedin, Aaron Hawkins \u2013 one of the country\u2019s youngest elected mayors. Hawkins, 35, is already a familiar sight on the city\u2019s roadsides because he hitchhiked to work as city councillor \u2013 a practise he would continue despite the offer of a mayoral car.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got 15 minutes and you get unfiltered feedback from people who probably aren\u2019t ever going to turn up to a council annual plan process or a bylaw review hearing,\u201d says Hawkins, who travelled to work on Wednesday with a beekeeper. \u201cGetting those perspectives from people about what they think\u2019s going well or not well in the city is great.\u201d\n\nA two-term councillor, Hawkins was in 2014 one of only two local representatives in New Zealand aged under 30, and has worked to support other young candidates entering politics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a willingness in the wider community, not just among fellow young people, to see those perspectives represented in local decision-making,\u201d he said. \u201cThe climate strike movement has been incredibly helpful in that, with thousands of young people marching in the streets, demanding that we do better and demonstrating leadership.\u201d\n\nFor the youthful newcomers, raising their profiles and convincing sceptical voters had at times been a challenge.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tamatha Paul, 22, was elected to the city council in Wellington. Photograph: Supplied\n\nTamatha Paul, 22, who was elected to the city council in the capital Wellington, says she and 60 volunteers had run her campaign with military precision. Over six months, they had visited each home in her ward multiple times and texted voters with personalised updates on issues they cared about.\n\n\u201cWith political parties, often they have access to pre-existing data that will tell them who in the ward already supports them and they\u2019ll just revisit those homes,\u201d says Paul, a former student leader who has worked on prison and marijuana law reform campaigns. \u201cI wanted a mandate and I didn\u2019t just want it to be progressive residents, I wanted every resident I could sway while retaining my own values.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Handford, 18, says she was often asked about her life experience and credentials.\n\n\u201cMy response was, well, don\u2019t I bring a different perspective? And maybe that perspective is what we need,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at what life experience and credentials have done for us so far, maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider the way we look at governance.\u201d", "description": "The number of elected officials under 30 doubled in city and district elections.
