In are thick, bushy caterpillars seen on the likes of Cara Delevingne and Meghan Markle (who reportedly turns to Audrey Hepburn for inspiration, when it comes to the upper third of her face.)\n\nPrescriptive advice on how to style eyebrows can be maddening. Look up any online tutorial and you\u2019ll get this main advice: your arches should look natural. One might think that means they can just let their brows grow the way they are. How naive.\n\nIncreasingly, Natural brows has become shorthand for arches that have been enhanced with a serum, pencil, gel, or prodded with a tiny tattoo gun that deposits a fuller-looking arch for around $2,000 a pop.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make you want to give up and buy an eye patch that covers everything. But anyone who has ever felt, as the term goes, \u201cbrow envy,\u201d isn\u2019t alone. Last year, conspiracy theorists speculated that Justin Trudeau might be insecure about the divisive feature, after a video taken at the G7 summit appeared to show one of his arch extensions fall off.\n\nThose in pursuit of perfection can turn to beauty blogs and Reddit forums for help with styling. (One oft-repeated rule: \u201cYour eyebrows should be sisters, not twins.\u201d) But, like most salon talk, gossip begins to flow fast. For every well-intended tutorial, there are dozens more memes shaming over- or underdone brows, dutifully catalogued on Pinterest boards and Instagram pages.\n\n\u201cEyebrows are so important in unexpected ways,\u201d makeup artist Mary Irwin told The Daily Beast. \u201cThink about Frida Kahlo, Brooke Shields, the 1920s skinny brow\u2014those all made statements about beauty, politics, and our place in the world. Unfortunately, personal preference can sometimes override common sense and people end up with crazy shapes that don\u2019t fit the proportion of the face and just look awful.\u201d\n\nEnter, Awful Eyebrows, a subreddit dedicated to documenting just that. With over 150,000 followers, administrators have described it as simply \u201ca place for embarrassing eyebrows.\u201d Users can upload photos of celebrities, reality TV stars, or\u2014in one case\u2014\u201cthe homewrecker my dad left my mom for,\u201d and judge their makeup skills. Or lack thereof.\n\nIrwin isn\u2019t surprised by such emotional responses. \u201c[Brows are] a big part of what shapes a face and makes it look proportional and attractive,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen something is \u2018off\u2019 or extreme, and not in an artistic sense, it triggers a \u2018something\u2019s wrong\u2019 reaction.\u201d\n\nOne Awful Eyebrow regular, a 21 year-old from California who told The Daily Beast his name is James Smith, has used the subreddit since 2016. \u201cI have only posted once, but have thought about it constantly,\u201d Smith said in a DM. \u201cEyebrows are something I never really thought about sharing with anybody until I found the subreddit, and then anytime I have seen someone look that bad, I always know the perfect place to post them.\u201d\n\nSmith defines \u201cawful eyebrows\u201d as \u201canything that makes me think the following: \u2018Why would anyone intentionally put the effort to modify their look to look like THAT?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t think \u201cnatural\u201d brows are ever awful: \u201cI see them more like a bad haircut.\u201d\n\n\u201c I think it is more of a public discussion than public shaming. \u201d\n\nEven though people flock to the forum to post screenshots taken from Facebook or Instagram\u2014presumably without the subject\u2019s consent\u2014Smith doesn\u2019t think that Awful Eyebrows \u201cshames\u201d anyone. (Some of community\u2019s rules are, \u201cNo harassment\u201d and \u201cNo mocking of features that cannot be helped.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI think it is more of a public discussion than public shaming,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNo one on reddit is really malicious toward the subjects of posts, even if [they have] really goofy or messed up eyebrows. We come to the site for the commentary, and most of us don\u2019t enjoy cruelty or encourage shaming.\u201d\n\nIndeed, when brave souls decide to post their own photos on Awful Eyebrows for help with makeup tips, the comments usually skew to thoughtful, constructive advice with abundant smiley emojis.\n\nIrwin, the makeup artist, turned to a principle of psychology to explain why there are so many \u201cawful eyebrows\u201d out there. \u201cIt reminds me of the Dunning-Kruger effect, where cognitive bias makes people mistakenly assess their ability as higher than it is, and leads to the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability. It\u2019s the aesthetic version of that\u2014you\u2019re convinced you look good, and nothing will tell you otherwise.\u201d\n\nFor Irwin, good brows don\u2019t have to be \u201cuber-full,\u201d \u00e0 la those famously fluffy ones that live below Delevingne's forehead. \u201cThey should be proportional to the face, in a color that\u2019s flattering to the skin and hair. I know people who bleach their brows to look invisible, and it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s all about your taste level.\u201d", "description": "A subreddit dedicated to \u201cawful eyebrows\u201d has become extremely divisive. \u201cI think it is more of a public discussion than public shaming,\u201d one user claims to The Daily Beast.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570562514/191008-alaina-bad-brows-tease_d1vd9x", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
