This week, we\u2019re going behind the scenes at Lifehacker. I\u2019m Abu Zafar, and this is how I work.\n\nLocation: New York\n\nCurrent gig: Video and Podcast Producer\n\nCurrent computer: MacBook Pro 2016\n\nCurrent mobile device: iPhone XR\n\nOne word that best describes how you work: Feverishly\n\nFirst of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today.\n\nI went to school for journalism in Ohio. I worked four jobs during school, produced and hosted a show about local politics on the school\u2019s television station, launched a Key and Peele-style sketch comedy show that ran for 3 seasons, led the entire entertainment programming department at the station, and skipped a lot of classes to do these things. I think I also started a short-lived podcast in there somewhere too. Eventually, I decided I hated Ohio and promptly moved to New York after graduation.\n\nOnce I arrived in New York, I left my retail job at Apple as quickly as I could to jump into the media world. I got my foot in the door at Mic, where I took a job cleaning, repairing and managing video equipment. I hustled and began producing Mic\u2019s daily news podcast, assisting with shoots and edits on the video team, and I eventually worked my way up to a video shooter/editor position.\n\nFrom there, I made the jump to a video producer position here at Lifehacker.\n\nWhat are your job responsibilities?\n\nI research, pitch, schedule, shoot, edit and host videos for Lifehacker. In short, my job is to produce videos from start to finish that fit the Lifehacker brand and appeal to our audience.\n\nTake us through a recent workday.\n\nI try to get in to work around 8:30 - 9 am. I don\u2019t really have a morning routine, and my days depend entirely on what my next deadline is. Some days are spent just editing a video. Other days there might a shoot, or I might be scheduling or scripting an upcoming video.\n\nBesides your phone, what apps, gadgets, or tools can\u2019t you live without?\n\nGoogle Calendar and Todoist run my life and make sure I get edits done on time, but also remember to eat and do laundry. Listening to podcasts on Pocket Casts keeps me sane during my commutes.\n\nBesides my phone and laptop, the only gadget I absolutely couldn\u2019t live without is my Nintendo Switch. I used to be a big gamer growing up, but basically stopped gaming when I went to college. Treating myself to a Switch for my birthday last year has gotten me back into gaming and it\u2019s been a delight diving back into a hobby I used to love so much.\n\nPhoto: Abu Zafar\n\nWhat\u2019s your workspace setup like?\n\nThe poor man\u2019s tech YouTuber setup. I aspire to have a sleek, minimalist workspace with perfectly managed cables, an unnecessarily high-resolution monitor (mounted on a swivel arm, of course) and LED lighting that automatically changes colour to match my mood. Instead I have an old monitor from college, a lamp that illuminates just 28 per cent of my room, and the only thing that swivels is my chair. My cables are actually managed really well though.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite shortcut or hack?\n\nAlways snooze emails. Never snooze alarms.\n\nWho are the people who help you get things done, and how do you rely on them?\n\nWe have a small three-person video team at work and I rely on my two colleagues for everything. Our skills complement each other well, and I\u2019ve learned lots of new things from them. Our senior producer Joel is an organisation and logistics whiz. My fellow producer Heather does amazing animation work.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest mistake you\u2019ve made at work, and how did you deal with it?\n\nLuckily, no one dies if I do my job wrong. So I try not to take things too seriously. But mistakes happen, and I try to deal with all the same way I\u2019d deal with any conflict in my life: communicate openly and honestly with everyone involved, don\u2019t dwell on the mistake, and find a path forward.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break?\n\nI\u2019ll fire up my Nintendo Switch, put on a podcast, and chill. Currently I\u2019m playing Civilization 6 and catching up on old episodes of Conan O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend. Alexander the Great just declared war on me for the third time and the episode with Jeff Goldblum was equal parts delightful and uncomfortable.\n\nScreenshot: Abu Zafar\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite side project?\n\nLast year, I launched a podcast network dedicated to celebrating video game storytelling. We have three podcasts on the Lore Party Podcast Network and our flagship podcast, Lore Party, has over 100 episodes. Managing the 15-person team and running the podcasts day in and day out has been one of the most rewarding projects of my life.\n\nWhat are you currently reading, or what do you recommend?\n\nI\u2019m currently re-reading the Witcher series in preparation for the upcoming Netflix show. I recently finished a biography of Saladin, the legendary leader of the Muslims during the Crusades. I\u2019m also reading a book about the French Revolution because history is wild folks, and we should all be prepared to take down the aristocracy if things go south in 2020.\n\nCan you share a music playlist you\u2019ve made, whether for working or elsewhere?\n\nI don\u2019t really listen to music. When I do, it\u2019s only Childish Gambino or Logic.\n\nWho else would you like to see answer these questions?\n\nLil Nas X and Kara Swisher.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\n\u201cTake a break, dude.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a problem you\u2019re still trying to solve?\n\nWhether I want a corgi or a golden doodle.", "description": "Every week, we share the shortcuts, workspaces, and productivity tips of our favourite experts.
