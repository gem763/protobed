We\u2019ve been swapping our Virginia home for one in Florida for the past four winters and boy, have we made a lot of snowbirding mistakes.\n\nLet me tell you seven lessons we\u2019ve learned. If you\u2019ll be a snowbird this winter, maybe they\u2019ll help you avoid our goofs.\n\n1. Choose a place that reflects your lifestyle. Often, snowbirds choose areas based on where they\u2019ve vacationed. But here\u2019s the thing: Spending a few months somewhere and living your daily life there is not a vacation. That\u2019s why your snowbird location needs to reflect the kinds of activities and lifestyle you most enjoy doing regularly.\n\nIf you\u2019re an active, Type A personality, you won\u2019t be content with a laid-back beach community for long. So, you might want to rethink that isolated beach house and choose an area where you can keep active, go to different restaurants, hang out with others and live a lifestyle similar to the one you have up north.\n\n2. Don\u2019t go all in the first year. Start your snowbirding experience by renting a place just for a month or two before committing for the full winter. You really won\u2019t know if you love it until you live it and won\u2019t know if you\u2019ve chosen the right place until you\u2019ve spent several weeks or more there. If you\u2019re not happy, try a new area next year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: They ditched America to retire by a lake in Chile on about $3,000 a month \u2014 and rarely come back\n\nOnce you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve found the right spot, book the whole winter. If you can, talk with the landlord and book the following year before you leave. Good rentals go quickly.\n\n3. Go electronic with all your bills. Years ago, it was difficult to keep up with the business of your life when you were away from home. You had to rely on the mail to receive and pay bills and get checks, plus keep up with the myriad things you had to do. Technology, however, has made it so much easier.\n\nSo, before you leave home for the winter, create automatic payments with your regular creditors, set up electronic bill pay with your bank and, if your regular bank doesn\u2019t have a branch where you\u2019ll be, open a checking account near your winter home. Then, set up the ability to electronically transfer funds back and forth between your banks.\n\n4. Make new friends. One of the difficult things about being away from home for months at a time is the growing distance you\u2019ll feel with friends and family. You try to stay current \u2014 FaceTiming, texting or calling frequently \u2014 but it\u2019s not the same. You can\u2019t get together for hours at a time over dinner, for instance.\n\nFortunately, when you join a new community as a snowbird, you\u2019re likely to find many there just like you. Introduce yourself.\n\n5. Don\u2019t overbook visitors. Friends and family from up north may want to visit, since you\u2019ll be basking in the sun while they\u2019d be shoveling snow. Just don\u2019t overdo extending open invitations.\n\nAlso see: Where\u2019s the best place for me to retire?\n\nWe love when our pals and loved ones come to visit. But being a frequent host takes a lot of time and energy. So, schedule those visits in moderation. Otherwise, your winter home will turn into a bed-and-breakfast (without the income!) Also, try to limit the length of stay for your house guests. As Ben Franklin said: \u201cGuests, like fish, begin to smell after three days.\u201d\n\n6. Make your snowbirding home a second home. If you buy a place rather than renting one, it\u2019s quite a bit easier to keep clothes and other necessities there so you don\u2019t have to lug them all back and forth. But even if you\u2019re renting, it\u2019s possible to store some items either in the residence itself (with the landlord\u2019s permission) or in a nearby storage unit. Doing so will make traveling to and from much easier. And having your belongings with you will add to the feeling of your snowbird home feeling like \u201chome.\u201d\n\n7. Take your time traveling back and forth. For many people driving to their snowbird location, the trip takes two days, maybe three. What\u2019s your hurry? You\u2019ll be there for three or four months. Why not turn your travel into enjoyable road trips of four or five days or longer?\n\nStop to see places that are \u201calmost\u201d along the way. Visit friends or family you typically only see rarely. Stop in the fun city or national park that you\u2019ve been meaning to see for years. This will make the journey fun and easier on the body.", "description": "7 tips from a couple who made a few mistakes traveling from Virginia to Florida for the winters.", "authors": ["Bart Astor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR526_na_sno_ZG_20190918103953.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
