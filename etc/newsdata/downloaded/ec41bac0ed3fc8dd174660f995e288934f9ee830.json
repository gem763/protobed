A group of people wearing helmets, masks and goggles can be seen on the side of the sneaker design.\n\n\u201cBased on the global competitions guidelines, Vans can confirm that a small number of artistic submissions have been removed. This decision was taken to uphold the purpose of Custom Culture,\u201d Vans, a unit of VF Corp (VFC.N), said in a Facebook statement.\n\nVans did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nA search of the username Naomiso on the Custom Culture\u2019s website did not yield any result on Tuesday.\n\nSome people in Hong Kong have called for a boycott of the sneaker brand on Facebook while some retailers have suspended sales of Vans products.\n\n\u201cStarting from today, every branch of our company will suspend sales of all Vans products,\u201d said Search Sneaker Shop, one of the best-known sneaker stores in Hong Kong, in a Facebook post on Saturday.\n\nEYE OF A STORM\n\nHowever, mainland Chinese users on the Weibo social media platform praised Vans for getting rid of the design, after being enraged by it at first.\n\n\u201cPlease everyone let\u2019s support Vans this time. The Hong Kong losers are starting to boycott Vans, but the mainland market will lift it up,\u201d said one Weibo user.\n\nAnother company dicing with Chinese anger is Tiffany & Co which deleted a twitter advertisement on Monday showing a female model with a hand covering an eye.\n\nA female medic was hospitalised after being hit by a pellet in the eye during protests. She became a symbol for what protesters say is excessive police force.\n\nThe advertisement has not created waves on China\u2019s social media. Tiffany & Co did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment, a U.S. video game developer, said on Tuesday it had removed video-on-demand (VOD) replay of a Hearthstone match, after a masked Hong Kong player called for the liberation of the region in a post-game interview.\n\nChinese state television, meanwhile, said it would not air NBA exhibition games played in the country this week, heaping pressure on the U.S. basketball league after a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive backing the Hong Kong protests.", "description": "U.S. sports brand Vans has removed \"a small number\" of submissions in a sneaker design competition including one apparently giving a shout out to Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, as companies weigh the risks of angering China.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
