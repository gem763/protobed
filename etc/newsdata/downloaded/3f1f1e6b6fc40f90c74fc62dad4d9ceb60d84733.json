REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n\nReuters\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we get closer and closer to the first primary contests, the Democratic National Committee has unveiled new, stricter requirements for candidates to make the fifth Democratic debate on November 20, which will be hosted by MSNBC and the Washington Post.\n\nIn order to qualify for the November debate, candidates need both 165,000 individual donors and to earn either 3% in four DNC-approved national polls or 5% in two approved early-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada.\n\nPolls released between September 13 and November 13 \u2014 the week before the debate \u2014 will count towards qualification.\n\nRead more: How Bernie Sanders' heart attack helped convince Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to reject Warren\n\nSo far, nine candidates have met both requirements, according to Politico's Democratic primary poll tracker. Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the most recent candidate to meet both qualification thresholds.\n\nBut the stricter polling requirements leave some mid-tier candidates who easily qualified for the September and October debates at risk of being left off the stage.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke has also satisfied the fundraising requirement and has two qualifying polls, giving him a good shot at making the stage.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard has the required 165,000 donors but just one qualifying poll so far, and former HUD Secretary Julian Castro has zero polls, meaning neither will likely qualify for November. Castro recently threatened to drop out of the race altogether if he doesn't raise $800,000 by Halloween.\n\nSen.
