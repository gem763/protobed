Let\u2019s hope the Nats can move past last night and get another win!\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Mostly cloudy, slight chance of afternoon showers. Highs: Mid-to-upper 60s.\n\nTonight: Mostly cloudy. Showers likely by dawn. Lows: Mid-50s to near 60.\n\nTomorrow: Morning rain, ending in the afternoon. Highs: Upper 60s to mid-70s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nToday promises to be passable on the whole. A warm front passing the region may try to deliver a few showers but they won\u2019t be anything of much consequence if so. It does continue to look dry for the evening and into the early overnight, as well. The main chance of rain focuses on Sunday morning, then it\u2019s back to decent weather to start the week.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

Highs generally head toward the mid-60s, with some upper 60s mixed in. It could touch 70 downtown. A warm front lifting through the area could deliver some showers during the afternoon or into early evening, but any of that should be quick and light if it happens. Winds are turning toward the southeast with time, around 5 to 10 mph. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: Game 4 of the World Series should go off without much weather concern. Clouds rule as muggier air is on the way in. This combo means it won\u2019t cool off all that much overnight. As we get past midnight and toward the pre-dawn hours, odds of rain are up. And rain should be steadier by sunrise. Lows are in the mid-50s to near 60. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates.

Not the greatest news for the Marine Corps Marathon, especially since a few heavier waves could swing through midmorning. It\u2019s not a cold rain at least, as dew points climb to near 60 ahead of an approaching front. Kind of humid for late October. Highs should head into the 70s on a south wind. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Somewhat cooler and drier air moves in. It\u2019s not super cool or dry for the time of year, though. Game 5 of the World Series should be rain free, or any random shower is quick to pass. Lows range from near 50 in the cool spots to the upper 50s downtown. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nMonday and Tuesday are looking rather nice from here. High temperatures both days wander toward 70 degrees. Monday may be the sunnier of the two as a cold front from the northeast may encroach on the area by Tuesday, delivering some clouds with time. At this point it doesn\u2019t seem it\u2019ll make it through here, but if it does it could be cloudier and cooler than currently expected.
