He says his on-field performance as a rookie last season was overshadowed by his feel-good back story.\n\nMr. Griffin\u2019s left hand was amputated at age 4, the result of amniotic band syndrome, a congenital birth defect. His father, Terry Griffin, still put him through the same football drills as his twin brother, Shaquill Griffin, and even adapted gym equipment so the boys could work out together.\n\nMr. Griffin\u2019s eye-popping stats in the 2018 NFL Combine caught the eye of the Seahawks, who chose him in the fifth round of that spring\u2019s player draft. Reunited with his brother, a Seahawks cornerback, and the first one-handed player drafted into the modern NFL, Mr. Griffin became a media sensation.\n\nMr. Griffin made just 11 tackles in the 2018 season, but was a special-teams stalwart. He spent the off-season fine-tuning his diet and workout with the help of his brother back home in St. Petersburg, Fla. Mr. Griffin, 24, says he felt stronger than ever going into preseason but injured his right knee in an August exhibition game.\n\nMr. Griffin tackles De\u2019Mornay Pierson-El of the Oakland Raiders in their preseason game on Aug. 29 in Seattle.

Seattle hosts the Cincinnati Bengals Sunday in its season opener.\n\nPhotos: No NFL Player Works Out Like Shaquem Griffin A look at the work the Seattle Seahawks linebacker put in at the training room this preseason The Seattle Seahawks purchased new equipment that allows Shaquem Griffin, whose left hand was amputated when he was 4, to perform the same exercises as other players in the weight room this year.

Daniel Silverberg for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Workout\n\nMr. Griffin calls his twin brother his secret weapon in the gym. \u201cWhen one of us gets tired, the other one motivates to get in another rep and push harder,\u201d he says. \u201cWe keep each other competitive.\u201d\n\nThe men worked out 90 minutes to two hours five days a week this off-season, devoting three days to upper body and two days to lower body. A leg day might have included Mr. Griffin doing deadlifts, pushing a weighted plate across the gym, and tossing a medicine ball against a wall or to his brother and then performing a one-legged squat.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How would you feel about having a close relative as a workout buddy? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cI actually love squats,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d do squats over pull-ups any day. They\u2019re the hardest.\u201d Mr. Griffin wears a prosthetic on upper-body days to perform exercises like pull-ups, rows and 225-pound bench presses. The brothers did 30 minutes of core work each day, including crunches, bicycle crunches and v-ups, where you lay on the floor, face up, and touch fingers to toes. Their father owns a towing business. Sometimes they\u2019d go to his shop and perform tire flips or push cars.\n\nRecovery was a focus. Mr. Griffin would get two massages a week and would visit a chiropractor every other week. He also has a sauna in his house and regularly foam rolls.\n\nIvan Lewis, Seattle\u2019s head strength and conditioning coach, says the team purchased new equipment that allowed Mr. Griffin to do everything that everyone else was doing in the weight room this year. A new harness that straps around his shoulders allows him to deadlift significant amounts of weight and perform Olympic movements such as clean pulls with more force, he says.\n\n\u201cWhen I pull on something heavy, the harness strap pulls down on my shoulders,\u201d Mr. Griffin says. \u201cPulling, snatching and throwing heavier weights around is more doable.\u201d Position-specific drills to enhance game speed were also a big part of pre-season training.\n\nShaquem Griffin, left, and Shaquill Griffin walk off the field during a game against the Minnesota Vikings on Dec. 10, 2018 in Seattle.

The chef dropped off personalized meals every other day at the home they share. Instead of eating three big meals a day, the brothers would eat four or five smaller meals\u2014small for an NFL player, anyway.\n\n\u201cI used to eat whatever I wanted,\u201d Mr. Griffin says, \u201cbut I realized food is my fuel and affects my performance and recovery.\u201d Breakfast is six egg whites with sweet potatoes, turkey bacon and sausage. Post-workout they eat protein bowls of brown rice, broccoli and chicken or steak. Lunch and dinner are either fish or baked chicken with brown rice and a roasted vegetable. Cheesecake is his splurge.\n\nThe Gear\n\nMr. Griffin is a Nike loyalist. (He has an endorsement deal with the company.) He wears compression pants to help with muscle recovery. He uses a Theragun, a massage tool that looks like a drill with a massage ball at the end. \u201cWe are big on bodywork,\u201d he says. \u201cWe even have a massage chair like you\u2019d find in a nail salon at our house.\u201d\n\nThe Playlist\n\nMr. Griffin is an R&B fan. Favorite artists include Earth, Wind & Fire, Keith Sweat and the Isley Brothers.\n\nSweating With Your Sibling\n\nSibling rivalry can boost a workout regimen\u2014depending on the siblings, says Laurie Kramer, a professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University in Boston. She says negative sibling rivalries can often be the result of family dynamics.\n\n\u201cParents may favor one child over the other in ways that feel unfair, and anger and frustration can leak out in a physical way,\u201d she says. \u201cThat can lead to low self-worth in one child and create resentment.\u201d\n\nIn general, she says competition is viewed by the public in a more positive light. \u201cWe compete with others or ourselves and are trying to match or surpass, whereas rivalry involves elements of competition but also negative emotions,\u201d she says.\n\nDr. Kramer points to the book \u201cThe Psychology of Rivalry,\u201d which underscores how sibling solidarity can be a positive force. The book references how the Griffin brothers play on the same team and push each other for the good of the team.\n\nMichael Rogers, a professor in the department of human performance studies at Wichita State University, says there are plenty of pros for parents to have children who play the same sport and on the same team. It\u2019s more convenient, for one thing.\n\nHe says challenges can arise when siblings compete for the same position on a team. \u201cEncourage your kids to pursue their passions,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s an age gap, make sure the intensity level is appropriate for the younger one.\u201d As siblings age, Dr. Rogers says childhood competition can turn into motivation to keep fit and in touch, especially if siblings live far apart but connect via technology.\n\nWrite to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.com", "description": "The Seattle Seahawks linebacker tweaked his diet and boosted his off-season routine with the help of his twin brother and teammate, Shaquill Griffin.", "authors": ["Jen Murphy"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104403/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
