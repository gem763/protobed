The prime minister apologized and said \u201cit was a dumb thing to do.\u201d\n\nTime magazine posted the photo, which it says was published in the yearbook from the West Point Grey Academy, a private school in British Columbia where Trudeau worked as a teacher before entering politics. It depicts Trudeau wearing a turban and robe, with dark makeup on his hands, face and neck.\n\nTrudeau, who launched his reelection campaign exactly one week ago, said he should have known better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pissed off at myself, I\u2019m disappointed in myself,\u201d Trudeau told reporters traveling with him on his campaign plane.\n\nThe Canadian prime minister is but the latest politician to face scrutiny over racially insensitive photos and actions from their younger days. Earlier this year, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam faced intense pressure to resign after a racist picture surfaced from his 1984 medical school yearbook page. He denied being in the picture but admitted to wearing blackface as a young man while portraying Michael Jackson at a dance party in the 1980s.\n\nTrudeau said the photo of him was taken at the school\u2019s annual dinner which had an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d theme that year. Trudeau was dressed as a character from \u201cAladdin.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister said it was not the first time he has worn makeup before, saying he wore makeup while performing a version of the Harry Belafonte song, \u201cBanana Boat Song (Day-O)\u201d during a talent show.\n\n\u201cI should have known better then but I didn\u2019t, and I am deeply sorry for it,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask Canadians to forgive me what I did. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I take responsibility for it. It was a dumb thing to do.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said he\u2019s always been more enthusiastic about costumes than is \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are the situations I regret deeply,\u201d he added.\n\nThe photo\u2019s publication could spell more trouble for Trudeau, who polls say is facing a serious challenge from Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.\n\nTrudeau has been admired by liberals around the world for his progressive policies in the Trump era, with Canada accepting more refugees than the United States. His Liberal government has also strongly advocated free trade.\n\nBut the 47-year-old son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was already vulnerable following one of the biggest scandals in Canadian political history, which arose when Trudeau\u2019s former attorney general said he improperly pressured her to halt the criminal prosecution of a company in Quebec. Trudeau has said he was standing up for jobs.\n\nTrudeau said he would have a conversation with his kids in the morning about taking responsibility.", "description": "Canadian leader Justin Trudeau\u2019s campaign for national elections was hit Wednesday by the publication of a yearbook photo showing him in brownface makeup at...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK164_trudea_ZG_20180531185358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
