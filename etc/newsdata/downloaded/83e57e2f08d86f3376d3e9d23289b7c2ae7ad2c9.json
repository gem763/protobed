Initially, there is outrage. Maybe there are even the remnants of shock, although it is happening so often these days that shock feels like a luxury we should no longer be allowed.\n\nAnd then you know what\u2019s next. Things go a bit quiet. We cover up the memories with a shroud and let dust settle on the shroud and make it grey. And then we start finding excuses not to punish racism.\n\nWe have got really rather good at this part. In fact, we have become expert at it. Not just UEFA, who have been pathetically ineffectual in this area for a long time.\n\nUEFA have been pathetically ineffectual in dealing with racism for a long time now\n\nJohn Barnes will say a black man in inner city England without an education has it worse. And he may be right. And people who hate footballers and their wealth will applaud.\n\nBut then maybe a poor Bangladeshi worker toiling in unbearable heat in Qatar and working in the kafala system has it worse still. So what? One kind of injustice should never be used to excuse another. Others will ask \u2018who are we to cast the first stone?\u2019 And they may be right, too. For we are no angels.\n\nYomping around European capitals armed with our new Brexit-inspired braggadocio, colonising streets and city squares with our red and white flags, singing songs about German bombers in Dortmund, reviving No Surrender to the IRA, the old marching tune of Combat 18.\n\nThen there\u2019s the idea that racism is a societal problem, not a football problem. And in a way that is right, too.\n\nBut I\u2019m not quite sure what point it proves. Isn\u2019t the point that we should tackle racism where it manifests itself? In America, there is little racism in sports grounds. But white policemen seem to shoot an awful lot of black civilians.\n\nThere is always someone who tells players that protest against injustice would be wrong. They\u2019re the same people who would tell Colin Kaepernick not to take a knee and John Carlos and Tommie Smith not to give a black power salute and Muhammad Ali not to say that he \u2018ain\u2019t got no quarrel with them Vietcong\u2019. The authorities are afraid of protest. They know its power. So they always try to promote reasons to stay quiet.\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight: our game against Bulgaria last week should have been abandoned and awarded to England.\n\nThe three-step protocol is a joke. The referee should have taken the teams off. It should be his responsibility to do the right thing. Failing that, England should have walked off.\n\nOur game against Bulgaria last week should have been abandoned and awarded to England\n\nIt is the one thing that would force UEFA into real action. If England had walked off, there would be no more empty words. I guarantee you Bulgaria would have been thrown out of the Euros by now. Banned. Shamed. End of story. Bye bye until you can be better.\n\nSo the first myth we need to explode is another trope parroted by those who want us to do as little as possible. It\u2019s the one that says the human filth hooting monkey noises at England\u2019s black players last Monday night in Sofia and the scum making Nazi salutes in the stands would have won if Gareth Southgate\u2019s team had walked off. They would not have won. They would have lost.\n\nIf England had walked off, two things would have happened: our players would have attracted world wide acclaim for finally saying that enough is enough and that they will not take this any more. They would have been hailed as pioneers.\n\nAnd UEFA would have been plunged into crisis. Suddenly, they would have had to confront the reality of the ugliness growing fast around football again. Suddenly, they would have had to accept that paltry fines and partial stadium closures and other slaps on the wrist are simply not doing it.\n\nThey would have had to do something radical. Like ban Bulgaria from international competition. That\u2019s what Hristo Stoichkov, their former captain, suggested before he broke down in tears on television last week. It took guts for him to say that and he\u2019s right. It\u2019s time for UEFA to stop fiddling at the margins and take some real action.\n\nUEFA would have had to confront the reality of the ugliness growing fast around football again\n\nThey did it to English clubs after the Heysel disaster and we deserved it. England were on the brink of being chucked out of Euro 2000 after our hooligan fans ran amok in Belgium as well. We would have deserved that too. Now it\u2019s time to do the same to countries and clubs that allow racism to spew from their stadiums.\n\nThese are not petty infractions. This is an evil and it should be treated as such. This is a return to a dark age. This is subjecting footballers to things they should never have to be subjected to and which are a basic affront to any idea of civilised society. And if UEFA won\u2019t tackle it willingly, they should be forced to do it.\n\nA walk-off would do that. Haringey Borough left the pitch on Saturday after it appeared their Cameroon goalkeeper was abused by a visiting Yeovil fan during their FA Cup match. But it will need action by a high-profile nation like Germany or Holland or France or England.\n\nUEFA would do the right thing then, only if out of shame. And fear. And then it would be up to Bulgaria, in this instance, to decide whether it wanted to confront its issues or submit to a long exile from international football. Its shot at education. It\u2019s choice.\n\nAnd yes, let\u2019s not forget ourselves. This isn\u2019t just about Bulgaria. We should all be subject to the same rules and it is time the penalties for racist abuse got a whole lot more severe. If they don\u2019t, if we don\u2019t show the collective will to fight it, if we do not instil in associations or clubs the fear of heavy penalties for permitting this scourge, then it will fester and grow.\n\nWhen UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin talks about fighting racism, that's all it is: talk\n\nMillwall, for instance, were fined just \u00a310,000 by the FA at the start of this season for another racism offence. It was not the first time and yet we chose to give them a paltry fine and issue them with \u2018a 12-point action plan\u2019. Next time it happens, Millwall should be deducted points. The next time after that, relegated.\n\nThe same when England fans cause trouble abroad. It is only a minority. But the minority cause trouble so often, it is becoming an issue again. Any idea that after Bulgaria we occupy a moral high ground is a joke.\n\nFines for racism are pathetic. Manchester City had to pay more for being a few seconds late on to the pitch. Besiktas had to pay more for \u2018insufficient organisation\u2019 when a cat wandered on to the pitch during their Champions League game with Bayern Munich in 2018.\n\nSo when UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin talks about the admirable stance in fighting racism, that\u2019s all it is: talk. We\u2019ll soon find out if Bulgaria are to be thrown out of Euro 2020, which should be the minimum punishment. Anything less would be another victory for the apologists.\n\nFigures just released show that 1.12 billion viewers watched coverage of the Women\u2019s World Cup in France last summer. During the tournament, the record UK TV audience for a women\u2019s football match was broken four times, ending with a peak of 11.7m for the loss to United States in the last four.\n\nAnd last week, the FA announced the match with Germany at the start of next month had become the first England women\u2019s game to sell out Wembley. We can safely say that the idea no one cares about women\u2019s football is dead in the water.\n\nWomen's football is growing at an incredible rate and there is so much interest in the game\n\nJapan have won the World Cup already!\n\nA strange thing happened at Oita Station on the island of Kyushu at the end of last week.\n\nThe Japan Rail employees who staff the ticket office at the central gate arrived at work in new uniform. They still wore their regulation peaked caps but their usual starchy shirts had been replaced by the red and white jersey of the Japan national rugby team.\n\nThis is not a country where officialdom does levity easily and so it was another sign of the impact the Brave Blossoms have had on this country and the rest of us.\n\n53% of Japan's population had watched the Brave Blossoms take on Scotland last Sunday\n\nSixty million Japanese, 53 per cent of the population, watched Japan\u2019s group game with Scotland last Sunday. That figure will be beaten by the audience for Sunday's quarter-final with South Africa.\n\nThere is something beautiful about watching the way their team plays the game, something about its fearlessness and its optimism and its exuberance.\n\nSouth Africa are likely to be too good for the hosts in Tokyo today but for what they have already done for the game here and across the world, the Brave Blossoms have already won.", "description": "OLIVER HOLT: When footballers are defiled by racism, when other people try to make them feel inhuman and like animals and like inferior beings, the pattern is often the same.", "authors": ["Oliver Holt For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/21/19936258-0-image-a-99_1571516981830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
