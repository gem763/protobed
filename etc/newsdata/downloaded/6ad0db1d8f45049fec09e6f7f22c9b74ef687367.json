At the same time, Texas has more inmates in state prisons than nearly any other state, and ranks sixth in incarceration rates. It might need more Creuzots. Whether he can succeed will reveal a lot about the appetite for reformers outside their traditional strongholds.\n\nRead: The sheriff who\u2019s defying ICE\n\nMichael Mata, the president of the Dallas Police Association and one of Creuzot\u2019s outspoken critics, told me the DA\u2019s public comments about his policy change on petty theft struck him as as an irresponsible, opportunistic bid for attention. \u201cYou just hear about the DAs in these cities saying the big, bad cops are out there arresting people who are just trying to survive,\u201d Mata said. \u201cIt only furthers the disconnect between the community and the police officers who serve it.\u201d He said local shop owners have told him they are now struggling with shoplifting.\n\nCreuzot told me he has talked with representatives of retail associations, who have not mentioned a shoplifting spike, and any allegations of an uptick in crime as a result of his policies have not been substantiated. The DA, who has worked with Republicans in the past, also said he wasn\u2019t bothered by Abbott\u2019s tweet about him. \u201cI got a big chuckle out of that,\u201d he said. \u201cHe probably wasn\u2019t serious when he said it.\u201d\n\nTaking controversial positions isn\u2019t new to Creuzot. From 1982 to \u201989, he worked as an assistant prosecutor in the Dallas DA\u2019s office, where he was tasked with reexamining the case of Randall Dale Adams, who was convicted of killing a police officer and made famous as the subject of Errol Morris\u2019s documentary The Thin Blue Line. Creuzot believed that Adams was innocent. The DA, John Vance, decided to retry Adams\u2014and assigned the case to one of the prosecutors who had initially mistried him. The conviction was later thrown out, and the case was dismissed based on evidence from the film. Creuzot, alongside another prosecutor, was uneasy with Vance\u2019s handling of the case and resigned from the office shortly after.\n\nIn 1991, he was appointed by then\u2013Governor Ann Richards to be a state district judge. Richards assigned him to the Texas Punishment Standards Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the Texas penal code in order to keep offenders from recommitting crimes. The commission came up with the idea of opening rehabilitative centers to treat people instead of incarcerating them.\n\nIn 1998, Creuzot started a program called the Dallas Initiative for Diversion and Expedited Rehabilitation and Treatment (DIVERT Court). It offered substance-abuse treatment in lieu of long sentences and helped to bring about a 68 percent reduction in recidivism. \u201cIt was the first time anyone had seen anything like that in the state of Texas,\u201d he told me. Later he was able to persuade the Texas legislature to fund it and other programs based on the savings it provided. While on the bench, though, he clashed with other judges who he felt were making decisions outside their legal authority. He retired in 2012 in part because he was tired of fighting with them.", "description": "As a progressive district attorney in one of the reddest states, Dallas County\u2019s John Creuzot is a controversial figure.", "authors": ["Ariel Ramchandani"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19275829005139/facebook.jpg?1571862400", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
