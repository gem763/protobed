And some days it\u2019s hard to write your feelings if you're not in the right place.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"The last few weeks I\u2019ve been in a really weird place... I find it hard to talk about it .. I guess it\u2019s anxiety and pressure of life ... and when I actually reached out to someone they said I was draining.\"\n\nShe went on to criticise the person she reached out to, who she did not name.\n\nThe blonde bombshell urged her followers to \"be nice to people\" as you never know what someone might be going through.\n\n(Image: GC Images)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nCaroline continued: \"I feel like this is why some people keep their emotions to themselves. I certainly hate talking about my feelings. And being a burden is my biggest fear....\n\n\"I\u2019m lucky to be able to pick myself up when things feel s***. But what happens if someone can't?\n\n\"Be nice to people. You never know what\u2019s going on. Ever.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nCaroline is preparing to film the winter series of Love Island, which starts this January.\n\nEarlier this month she teased she was starting a new job, though wouldn't say what it was.\n\nMany of her fans are convinced this means that filming is already underway.", "description": "The TV presenter, 39, confessed she had been in a 'really weird place' mentally over the last few weeks", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Instagram", "Gc Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564562.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_London-Celebrity-Sightings-September-25-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
