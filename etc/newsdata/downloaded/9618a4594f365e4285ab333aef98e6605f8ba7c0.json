Far from it", "language": "en", "text": "Liverpool\u2019s 3-0 win at Burnley on Saturday shows that last season\u2019s Premier League runners-up are continuing to make progress. Burnley have posed J\u00fcrgen Klopp real problems since his appointment on Merseyside, not always getting a result but constantly breaching Liverpool\u2019s defence. There was no great danger of that at the weekend, but the positives from a convincing win at a tough away ground were somewhat overshadowed. Instead, attention turned to a potential rift in the Liverpool squad. Worse still, it concerned players who will be utterly pivotal to their hopes of overcoming Manchester City and going one better in the league this season.\n\nWhen Liverpool have won big in the past, the names of Sadio Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah have often graced the same scoresheet. The relationship between the club\u2019s fearsome front three has been a key catalyst to transforming a team from hopefuls to European champions. For that reason, when Man\u00e9 was enraged at being substitute just moments after Salah had opted not to put him in on goal, the narrative was that there was trouble in paradise. Not long before, Salah had also attempted to go for goal himself rather than picking out Firmino in a far more favourable position.\n\nRoberto Firmino adds shine to Liverpool\u2019s victory over Burnley Read more\n\nTellingly, Salah, unlike his fellow forwards, had failed to find the net at Turf Moor. Regardless of the level you are playing at, if your teammates are scoring goals, it is tempting to force your way in on the act \u2013 at times to the detriment of the team. Had Liverpool been drawing the game or just winning by a single goal, Salah\u2019s decision-making may have been very different. You don\u2019t score the number of goals he has without taking the greedy option every once in a while, but is it unfair to say he is overly selfish.\n\nSalah is undoubtedly more individualistic in his play than his teammates, but he is also more effective in the final third. He is better at picking up positions not only to shoot for himself but pick out a teammate to do the same. He ranks tenth for chances created in the Premier League since the start of last season, with 77. That\u2019s way above either Man\u00e9 (55) or Firmino (46).\n\nThe modest number of chances the Brazilian creates may come as a surprise to some, but there is a reason for that. His job is to operate further from goal, allowing his wide teammates to bomb on in attempt to stretch the play and get behind the opposition\u2019s defence. Firmino, after all, has attempted to pass with more than 70% of his overall touches since the start of last season, with Man\u00e9\u2019s equivalent figure just over 65% and Salah\u2019s just under 60%.\n\nSalah shoots more often than his teammates, doing so with 7.5% of his touches to Man\u00e9\u2019s 4.8% and Firmino\u2019s 4.7%. He also attempts more dribbles, doing so with 8.1% of his touches to Man\u00e9\u2019s 5.5% and Firmino\u2019s 4.5%. Crucially though, his end product more than compensates for what some might see as selfishness. While Man\u00e9 scored as many goals as Salah last season (the pair shared the Golden Boot in the Premier League with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang), he managed just one assist \u2013 a tally he has already matched this campaign. Salah, by comparison, set up eight league goals last season and has set up two already this campaign.\n\nMan\u00e9 and Salah have an exceptional partnership, the most productive in the squad. They have set up chances for each other 40 times since the start of last season, with Man\u00e9 setting up Salah 23 times and Salah returning the favour on 17 occasions. The combination between Salah and Firmino is not far behind, on 38; Salah has teed up the Brazilian 21 times, being paid back with 17 chances in return.\n\nDavid Squires on \u2026 the Premier League story so far Read more\n\nInterestingly, the link-up between Firmino and Man\u00e9 is not nearly as effective. They have combined to create a chance for one another just 20 times since the start of last season \u2013 exactly half what Salah and Man\u00e9 have achieved. Again, Liverpool are at their most productive when Salah is involved.\n\nWith regards to Man\u00e9\u2019s outburst on the sidelines on Saturday, it is natural to become even more concerned with one\u2019s goal return in a team that scores so many. It sparks competition among teammates that may at times boil over into what some might consider petulance \u2013 see Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s reaction to being withdrawn for Gabriel Jesus last month. With the right guidance and coaching, that competition can breed great success.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sergio Ag\u00fcero is receives an earful from his manager as he leaves the pitch during Manchester City\u2019s game against Chelsea.

Would he have done so under different circumstances with the scoreline less comfortable? History, in terms of his own returns by way of chances created and assists when compared to his teammates, suggests he probably would.\n\nThrow in the fact that footballers have personal lives and mood swings outside of the game and one might come to the conclusion that Man\u00e9 was just more wound up than usual. Only time will tell if there is any genuine lasting friction between the players, but perhaps the international break will do everyone involved some good.\n\n\u2022 Visit WhoScored for more statistics and ratings\n\n\u2022 Follow WhoScored and Martin Laurence on Twitter", "description": "Salah shoots and dribbles more than Sadio Man\u00e9 and Roberto Firmino, but he also scores and sets up more goals", "authors": ["Martin Laurence"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebcdfb30cec8bcdc4f0785266df00f5b90171f6e/0_0_2398_1438/master/2398.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=066bc3f763d1dd3525706ae2de0d01c4"}
