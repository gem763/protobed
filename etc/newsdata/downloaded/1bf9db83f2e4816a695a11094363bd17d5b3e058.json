Shoppers between the ages of 35 and 44 expect to spend the most at $1,158, according to the findings.\n\nFor the two months leading up to the end of the year, holiday retail sales are expected to increase between 3.8 percent and 4.2 percent over 2018 for a total of between $727.9 billion and $730.7 billion, the survey indicated.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nNRF President and CEO Matthew Shay noted that consumers are in \u201cgood financial shape\u201d despite recent tariff hikes.\n\n\u201cConsumers are in good financial shape and willing to spend a little more on gifts for the special people in their lives this holiday season,\u201d he said.\n\nThis comes amid the United States and China showing no signs of progress toward ending a tariff war that threatens global economic growth.\n\nUnder Trump, the United States has slapped tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports and is planning to hit another $160 billion on Dec. 15. That would extend import taxes to virtually everything China ships to the United States. China has hit back by targeting about $120 billion in U.S. goods, focusing on farm products.\n\nThe tariffs Trump first imposed on Chinese imports last year largely spared American consumers by focusing on industrial goods. However, the latest rounds are targeting goods that consumers are looking to purchase for holiday gifts such as smartphones and baseballs.\n\nHOW HOLIDAY STAFFING ISSUES CAN CRUSH SMALL BUSINESSES\n\nShay said retailers are expected to import \u201cnear-record volumes\u201d of merchandise ahead of the tariffs that are scheduled to take effect in December.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The holiday shopping rush has already begun for nearly 40 percent of Americans who embarked on the mission for purchase that something special months before pumpkins were even carved.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/shopping-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
