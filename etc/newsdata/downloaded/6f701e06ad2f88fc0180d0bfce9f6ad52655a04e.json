Even the saints are terrible sinners, in their depiction. They hope to stall reform by inculcating broad cynicism in the public. This is precisely Trump\u2019s strategy. Trump\u2019s call to Zelensky was, it seems, part of an attempt to retain political power by depicting the entirety of Washington politics as a swamp. Because Trump\u2019s corruption is his greatest electoral vulnerability, he intends to blunt that weakness by demonstrating that his leading Democratic opponent isn\u2019t so different from himself.\n\nBut that opponent is in fact nothing like Trump\u2019s depiction, representing as he does the now old-fashioned American commitment to democracy in Ukraine.\n\nIn 2015, Joe Biden, then vice president, ventured to Kiev to lend support to the fledgling revolution. A year earlier, protesters had occupied the Maidan, the city\u2019s central plaza, protesting the thuggish rule of the pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. When police murdered 100 protesters, Yanukovych fled to Moscow and his government toppled. On the eve of Biden\u2019s visit, however, there were good reasons to worry that the euphoria of the revolution had failed to dislodge the corrupt power structure.\n\nThe avuncular pep talk he delivered to the Rada, the Ukrainian parliament, was rousing, self-aware, blunt, and compassionate. In lyrical prose, he praised the murdered and insisted that the Ukrainian political class redeem their suffering: \u201cThis is your moment. This is your responsibility. Each of you\u2014if you\u2019ll forgive me for speaking to you this way in your body\u2014each of you has an obligation to seize the opportunity that the sacrifices made in the Maidan.\u201d\n\nAt the peak of peroration, Biden argued that democracy requires removing the \u201ccancer of corruption.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a throwaway line. He made a detailed case against kleptocracy: \u201cIt siphons away resources from the people.\u201d He urged the country to reform the judiciary in general and the office of the prosecutor general in particular. And in private, he was even more forceful. He said that if the country didn\u2019t fire Viktor Shokin, the man who occupied that office, the United States wouldn\u2019t guarantee essential loans.\n\nShokin represented the failure of the revolution. The reborn democracy was flailing because the country hadn\u2019t punished and expunged representatives of the ancient regime. Ukraine never thoroughly investigated the atrocities committed against the protesters on the Maidan. The members of the political class connected to Yanukovych largely managed to escape without paying any price for looting the country, so they kept their fortunes and resumed their political meddling. In short, Shokin was the face of a culture of impunity.", "description": "Ever since the earliest years of this century, Ukraine has been the contested frontier in a grand ideological struggle.", "authors": ["Franklin Foer", "Staff Writer For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS17W6B/facebook.jpg?1569356484", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
