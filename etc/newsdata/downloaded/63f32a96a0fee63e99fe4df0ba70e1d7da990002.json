'And that particular trip has not been reimbursed but about three-fourths of it would be business and one-fourth would be personal. The Trump part would be considered personal because I don't get paid for representing the president.'\n\nRudy Giuliani said his trip to Madrid was paid for by other clients and he works for Donald Trump 'pro bono'\n\nWhile in Madrid, Giuliani met with Andrey Yermak (left), an aide to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (right)\n\nGiuliani claimed he helped Donald Trump on a 'pro bono' basis.\n\nHe said that Madrid trip was paid for by other clients for separate work that happened to coincide with the Ukrainian business.\n\nGiuliani also said he never charged the State Department for the work he did to meet with Ukrainian officials.\n\n'I've done work for the State Department before and I never charged them for it,' he said. 'They call upon citizens all the time. I did it at least three times with [former Secretary of State] Colin Powell... I did this as a service to my government.'\n\nMeanwhile House Democrats are demanding to know who are those clients paying for Giuliani.\n\n'Rudy needs to disclose his clients for the Ukraine work,' said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a New York Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n'He's up to his neck in criminals and dirty money. Was he playing the President to get himself paid? Seems there's no honor among thieves,' Maloney added.\n\nHouse Democrats, as part of their impeachment investigation, are investigating Trump's call to the Ukrainian president and allegations the U.S. would with hold military aide to the Ukraine unless they investigated an unproven theory about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt's unclear if Giuliani and his work are a target of the Democrats.\n\nBut Giuliani's work for the State Department, his ties to the Ukraine, his role in pushing conspiracy theories involving the Ukraine and the Bidens, and who paid for all this has come under increased scrutiny.\n\nThe former mayor was not a federal employee so he would not be subject to kind of government regulations that staffers are about possible conflicts of interest and outside work.\n\nGiuliani has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nGiuliani said he is not paid for his work for Trump but House Democrats want to know how his business is funded\n\nGiuliani was part of a push to get the Ukrainians to investigate Hunter Biden and Joe Biden\n\n'I haven't done anything in the Ukraine in two years. I have never done a deal in Ukraine,' he told the Daily Beast. 'I haven't even thought about a deal in Ukraine over the last two years.'\n\nEarlier this week, two Giuliani's associates - Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman - reportedly held one-way tickets for when they were arrested at Dulles International Airport on charges related to a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump's re-election, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nFruman and Parnas were held on a four-count indictment which included charges of conspiracy, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records.\n\nThe men allegedly had key roles in Giuliani's efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation against Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nOn Giuliani's visits to Ukraine, the pair had reportedly helped arrange meetings with Ukrainian officials as Giuliani tried to prove Biden and his family sold influence and squashed corruption investigations there.\n\nWednesday's indictments mark the first criminal charges related to the Ukraine controversy. While they do not suggest wrongdoing by the president, they raise additional questions about how those close to Trump and Giuliani sought to use their influence.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested on Wednesday on campaign finance charges\n\nGiuliani said he couldn't comment and that he didn't represent the men in campaign finance matters.\n\nGiuliani himself has emerged as a central figure in a scandal that has now engulfed Trump and left him facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he misused his office for his own political gains.\n\nOne of the key questions is who financed Giuliani's globe-trotting as he pursued unsubstantiated allegations that Biden had tried to fire Ukraine's then chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, to stop him investigating an energy company on which his son Hunter served as a director.\n\n'Nobody pays my expenses,' Giuliani said in an interview with Reuters on Friday. 'What does it matter if I'm getting paid for it. Isn't the real story whether he (Biden) sold out the vice presidency of the United States, not whether I got paid for it?'\n\nReuters was not able to independently verify how Giuliani paid for his trips.\n\nBiden has accused Giuliani of peddling 'false, debunked conspiracy theories.'\n\nGiuliani traveled to Madrid to meet Andrey Yermak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinskiy, a few days after a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Zelinskiy to investigate Biden. Yermak had sought the meeting with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani said that he chose Madrid as the meeting place because he was going to be there anyway on behalf of two clients, whom he declined to name.\n\n'We were negotiating where to meet. He was going to come to New York. I said Mr. Yermak, I'm going to Madrid for four days, five days. Would it be easier if I met you there? He said yes, so those expenses were paid by I assume one client. Since I took two days off I think I paid some of that personally as well.'\n\nGiuliani did not say what they discussed at that meeting, but a whistleblower complaint about Trump's call with Zelinksiy made public last week said U.S. officials had characterized the meeting as a 'direct follow-up' to the president's call.\n\nGiuliani said he had received no money from Trump's election campaign or the Republican National Committee, the bureaucratic body that oversees Trump's Republican Party.\n\nHe said he did not view his work as a 'political act.'\n\n'This began almost a year ago, two years before any election, when I heard the allegations about Joe Biden I did not think about them as connected to the 2020 election. At that point he wasn't even a candidate.'\n\nGiuliani said he met a Ukrainian prosecutor in Paris in April or May for further discussions about the firing of Shokin. He added that he had been in the French capital 'for other reasons once again.'\n\nGiuliani said he met Shokin's replacement, Yuriy Lutsenko, in Warsaw in February after first meeting him in New York in January.\n\nGiuliani said the meeting with Lutsenko in Warsaw was 'really social.'\n\n'I think it was either dinner or cigars after dinner. Not opportune for substantive discussion,' he said.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani said his trip to Madrid to meet with an aide to the Ukrainian president was funded by another client as Democratic lawmakers demand to know who is paying for his business.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/18/19599914-0-image-a-58_1570814783682.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
