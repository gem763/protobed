REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian\n\nPopulist-leaning Alberto Fernandez came out swinging against business-friendly incumbent Mauricio Macri, calling him responsible for the country\u2019s recession. But eager to fight Macri\u2019s effort at casting him as die-hard leftist who would isolate Argentina, Fernandez refused to be boxed in.\n\n\u201cI am not dogmatic,\u201d he said in a televised debate with Macri and several lesser-known candidates contesting the Oct. 27 election.\n\n\u201cThe solutions I offer will be both orthodox and heterodox. What you will never see are policies that go against those who produce and those who work for a living,\u201d he said.\n\nGrains producers in Argentina, one of the world\u2019s key bread-baskets, have been strong Macri supporters. But Fernandez\u2019s surprisingly comfortable win in the August primary all but ended Macri\u2019s hopes of being re-elected.\n\n\u201cFernandez is not playing populism here. He\u2019s sounding more like a an angry technocrat, blaming Macri for everything,\u201d Julio Burdman of local political polling firm Observatorio Electoral told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe probability of Fernandez not winning in the first round is very, very low. The economy has done nothing but get worse since the primary election, so it\u2019s not likely that Macri is gaining much ground,\u201d Burdman said.\n\nTo win in the Oct. 27 first-round, Fernandez must get at least 45% of the vote or 40% with a difference of 10 percentage points over his nearest rival.\n\nFarmers and other business groups have voiced fear that a Fernandez presidency would send Argentina back to the days when ex-President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner saddled the economy with heavy trade and currency controls that Macri quickly rolled back when he took office in late 2015.\n\nFernandez de Kirchner, who feuded with the farm sector during who two-terms in office and whose battles with bond-holders kept the country in default, is running as Fernandez\u2019s vice presidential candidate. Facing several corruption charges stemming from her 2007-2015 presidency, all of which she denies, she has been largely absent from the campaign.\n\nMacri won office on promises of using orthodox economics to attract the investment needed for sustainable economic growth.\n\nBut his fiscal push included highly unpopular cuts to public utility subsidies, which increased inflation by jacking up power and heating gas bills for businesses and families.", "description": "The front-runner in Argentina's presidential election reached out to undecided voters on Sunday, promising both orthodox and unorthodox policies to cure the country's deep economic troubles.", "authors": ["Hugh Bronstein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440570942&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D05P", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
