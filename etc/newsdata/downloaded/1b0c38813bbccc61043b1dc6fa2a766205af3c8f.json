He announced Friday that he would appear for questioning on Capitol Hill this week, in apparent defiance of the State Department.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland has requested that the Department of State allow him to testify as soon as possible,\u201d Jim McDermott, a lawyer representing Sondland, said in a statement emailed last Thursday. \u201cPrecisely because no one is above the law, Ambassador Sondland has turned over all relevant documents sought by Congress to the Department of State, as the Federal Records Act requires.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOne witness who may not be called before Congress is the still-anonymous government whistleblower who touched off the impeachment inquiry. Top Democrats say testimony and evidence coming in from other witnesses, and even the president himself, are backing up the whistleblower's account of what transpired during Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy. Lawmakers have grown deeply concerned about protecting the person from Trump's threats over the matter and may not wish to risk exposing the whistleblower's identity.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday, \"We don't need the whistleblower, who wasn't on the call, to tell us what took place during the call. We have the best evidence of that.\"\n\nSchiff said it \"may not be necessary\" to reveal the whistleblower's identity as the House gathers evidence. \"Our primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected,\" he said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Mike Emanuel and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, is expected to tell congressional lawmakers on Thursday that President Trump told him there was no quid pro quo when it came to Trump\u2019s controversial July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/08/694940094001_6093276976001_6093273055001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
