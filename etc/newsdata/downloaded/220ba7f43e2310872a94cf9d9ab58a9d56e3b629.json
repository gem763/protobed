This is what I got.\u201d\n\nLovato, who went on to rename her cellulite \u201ccelluLIT,\u201d said in this \u201cnew chapter\u201d \u2014 post overdose amid a comeback with new management, an upcoming album and acting gigs in the works (Will & Grace!) \u2014 it\u2019s about \u201cbeing authentic to who I am rather than trying to meet someone else\u2019s standards. So here\u2019s me, unashamed, unafraid and proud to own a body that has fought through so much and will continue to amaze me when I hopefully give birth one day.\u201d\n\nLovato also wrote about how she\u2019s relieved to be done with \u201ca strenuous workout schedule\u201d on top of 14-hour workdays and \u201cdepriving myself from a real birthday cake rather than opting for watermelon & whip cream with candles because I was terrified of REAL cake and was miserable on some crazy diet sh**.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cHere\u2019s me, RAW, REAL! And I love me. And you should love you too! Now back to the studio. I\u2019m working on an anthem.\u201d\n\nIn a P.S., she added, \u201cJust so everyone\u2019s clear. I\u2019m not stoked on my appearance BUT I am appreciative of it and sometimes that\u2019s the best I can do. I hope to inspire someone to appreciate their body today too.\u201d\n\nAnd inspire she did. Messages of praise from her fans \u2014 famous and non flowed in.
