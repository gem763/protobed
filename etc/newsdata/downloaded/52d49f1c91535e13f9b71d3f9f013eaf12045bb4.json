Though the Redskins cornerback wasn\u2019t involved in the play, he knew his team had made a devastating mistake, one they should have easily been aware of heading into a new season.\n\nMoments earlier, DeSean Jackson broke free, and as the Redskins understand, when the wide receiver breaks free on a play, that\u2019s it.\n\nJackson, with his blazing speed, scored two touchdowns Sunday \u2014 including the game\u2019s go-ahead score \u2014 and the Redskins gave up a double-digit lead in Sunday\u2019s 32-27 loss.\n\nFor years, Jackson had tortured the Redskins before joining them for two seasons and ultimately leaving in 2018 as a free agent. This offseason, Jackson reunited with the Eagles, giving Philadelphia an aspect that had been missing in recent years\u2014 speed.\n\nEven at 32 years old, Jackson routinely torched the Redskins throughout the second half \u2014 finishing the game with eight catches and 154 yards. Jackson\u2019s playmaking ultimately made the difference as Washington couldn\u2019t hold on to a 17-point lead.\n\nBefore Jackson swung the game, the Redskins looked well on their way to an upset.\n\nWashington entered the 2019 season with an unproven group of playmakers, but the coaching staff was optimistic their overall talent was better than last year. Washington, in particular, was high on second-year running back Derrius Guice, who coach Jay Gruden said was ready to earn the \u201cmother load\u201d of carries. Washington went as far as to keep Adrian Peterson, last year\u2019s rushing leader, because of its confidence in Guice.\n\nIt was the Redskins\u2019 success in the passing game, however, that jolted them to a 20-7 halftime lead. After having a 29th-ranked passing attack last year, Washington looked revitalized behind quarterback Case Keenum and a duo of speedy receivers. Keenum got into a rhythm with a series of quick throws and also took shots deep \u2014 the latter of which the Redskins rarely did in 2018.\n\nWashington first got on the board with a 48-yard touchdown from tight end Vernon Davis, who hurdled over Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby in a remarkable feat of athleticism.\n\nBy the end of the half, Keenum had 257 yards \u2014 more than what Alex Smith had in all but three of his 10 games last season.\n\nKeenum benefitted from a reworked receiving core. Third-rounder Terry McLaurin hauled in a 70-yard bomb in the second quarter to help the Redskins jump out to a 17-0 lead. In training camp, the Ohio State product emerged as a not-so-secret weapon for the Redskins, beating out former first-rounder Josh Doctson for a starting spot.\n\nMcLaurin finished with 125 yards in his debut. Doctson, by comparison, went three years without posting a 100-yard game with the Redskins.\n\nThe offense, though, stalled in the second half. A mixture of penalties, drops and incompletions prevented the Redskins from even getting a first down until late in the fourth. Washington added a garbage-time touchdown with six seconds left to cut Philadelphia\u2019s 12-point lead to five.\n\nDefensively, Washington was mostly solid to begin the game but wore down as the game went on. In the second quarter, Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz found a streaking Jackson up the seam for a 51-yard touchdown. Jackson blew by cornerback Josh Norman, who didn\u2019t have any safety help over the top.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 defensive line wasn\u2019t as effective as they\u2019d hoped to be. Washington sacked Wentz just once and the team also lost Jonathan Allen to a leg injury late in the first quarter. Allen did not return.\n\nThe game finally swung in the third quarter when Jackson torched rookie cornerback Jimmy Moreland and caught a 53-yard pass from Wentz. The Eagles took a 21-20 lead and Washington couldn\u2019t come back.\n\nWashington will now have to regroup before next week\u2019s home opener against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
