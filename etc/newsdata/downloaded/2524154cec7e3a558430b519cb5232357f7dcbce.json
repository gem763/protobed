Here are highlights from the release:\n\n\u2014Economic activity and employment appeared to grow at a modest pace in August and late July. Wages rose at a \u201cmodest to moderate\u201d pace from the earlier part of the summer, and price increases were also modest.\n\n\u2014\u201cAlthough concerns regarding tariffs and trade policy uncertainty continued, the majority of businesses remained optimistic about the near-term outlook,\u201d the Fed said in its summary of the report.\n\n\u2014While most sectors of the economy grew, agriculture remained weak and manufacturing activity \u201cwas down slightly from the previous period.\u201d That was consistent with a report this week from the Institute for Supply Management that pointed to a contraction in the factory sector in August. \u2014Housing remained stagnant in most districts, while new-home construction was flat. \u2014Consumer spending appeared mixed, with some districts reporting growth while others reported flat sales. The Atlanta Fed noted that retailers in its district saw \u201cheightened uncertainty among consumers due to the geopolitical environment; they also expressed concerns about whether this uncertainty will impact consumer confidence and spending behavior during the upcoming holiday season.\u201d \u2014There were 62 mentions of tariffs, trade policy or related terms, up from 54 in the previous beige book, released July 17. \u2014Reports about the impact of tariffs remained mixed. The New York Fed\u2019s contacts in retail and auto sales said the effects on prices haven't been noticeable. One of the Chicago Fed\u2019s contacts predicted that new tariffs on Chinese imports wouldn\u2019t start affecting retail prices until early 2020, while another reported that some retailers had already begun implementing \u201cincremental\u201d price increases. \u2014Some companies reported that tariff-related uncertainty was hampering their investment plans. \u201cSeveral contacts reported that both they and their customers had delayed capital spending as trade tensions and related uncertainty clouded their outlooks,\u201d the Cleveland Fed said. Conversely, one electrical-equipment firm in the Boston Fed\u2019s district said tariffs had led them to invest more in automating factories in the U.S. rather than moving them to Mexico.
