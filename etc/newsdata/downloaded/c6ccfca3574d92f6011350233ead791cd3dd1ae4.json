Supermarket products are now made with the sort of buzzy ingredients we expect to find in premium versions.\n\nDermatologist Dr Sam Bunting says: \u2018The price often has little bearing on what\u2019s in the pot these days. I recommend looking for products with clearly communicated levels of active ingredients.\u2019\n\nSainsbury\u2019s My Skin Matters Purifying Cleansing Milk contains rosehip oil and niacinamide, which take off make-up without stripping the skin of natural lipids.

Eyelash curlers have become a favourite tool of celebrities and can add the perfect finishing touch to eye make-up.\n\nBut the pressure of squeezing the lashes can pull on the hairs and, in a worst-case scenario, result in lash loss if you are not careful.\n\nTrichologist Trisha Buller says: \u2018The overuse of eyelash curlers is known to have an adverse effect. For good lash care, gently remove make-up every night, apply a lash conditioner to keep them hydrated and avoid using curlers.\u2019\n\nTo nourish lashes and encourage growth, try an enhancing product such as Nouveau Lashes Lash & Brow Conditioning Serum. shop.nouveaulashes.com Shop\n\n3 OF THE BEST: WINTER HAND CREAMS\n\nSHAMELESS INDULGENCE", "description": "Elsa McAlonan reveals a selection of the best skincare products on sale in UK supermarkets.
