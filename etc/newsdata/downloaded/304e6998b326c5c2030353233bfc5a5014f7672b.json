Passengers were being offered a full refund or to rebook on an alternative date or airline.\n\n\"We are very sorry that Balpa's actions will affect thousands more travel plans,\" she said. \"We urge them to call off their strike and return to negotiations.\"\n\nThe airline had previously estimated the strike would cost it \u00a340m a day.\n\nBalpa called the decision to cancel flights \"irresponsible and inconsiderate to its customers\" and said it was a strategy designed to save the airline money.\n\nBy giving passengers two weeks' notice, the airline avoids having to pay compensation.\n\nBalpa said it had set the second strike period at the later date to allow time for negotiations to take place, but that BA had not responded to its latest proposals.\n\nThe union said it had given BA \"multiple opportunities\" to work with them to avoid the strike.\n\nBritish Airways (BA) has offered pilots a pay rise of 11.5% over three years, which it says would boost the pay of some captains to \u00a3200,000.\n\nHowever, Balpa says many of its members earn much less than that, with new pilots starting on less than \u00a330,000.\n\nWhen BA cancelled flights a fortnight ahead of the two-day strike earlier this week, it mistakenly cancelled extra flights as well.\n\nThe airline was forced to draft in extra customer relations staff over the August bank holiday weekend to deal with hundreds of thousands of phone calls and messages, after customers found they could not get through to change their flights.", "description": "British Airways has begun emailing thousands of passengers ahead of another day of strike action.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7A6B/production/_108693313_p1qvcrcl.jpg"}
