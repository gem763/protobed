Three tries in the first 15 minutes and a bonus point before half-time was an emphatic response to last week\u2019s forced departure of Rob Howley, the man who shaped the way the Six Nations champions used possession for 12 years.\n\nWales won the grand slam earlier this year through an aggressive defence but what tended to be lost, after five scores under 30 points, was the capacity they had to come from behind to win, most notably when they trailed France by 16 points in Paris, but also against England in a far tighter contest. They showed a creative side, even if they did not flaunt it.\n\nHere, as Georgia braced themselves for a shoving contest in the scrum and lineout mauls to defend, they found the ball quickly spirited away to a midfield crowded with decoy runners. Georgia had set the speed to slow motion but immediately found themselves having to operate at fast forward. To their credit, they rallied after the break and tied the second period, but by then Wales were thinking about the matches which will shape their destiny this tournament, against Australia and Fiji.\n\nGeorgia had the ideal start as they packed down for a Wales scrum just two minutes in. All eight forwards shoved hard, still bound and enjoying themselves as Gareth Davies picked up and darted way, assessing his options before firing a flat pass to Jonathan Davies. The defence, unready, stood back and the centre had a free run to the line from 20 metres.\n\nDan Biggar, who was inadvertently clouted in the face by Liam Williams during the celebrations having suffered a cut chin during the warm-up, missed the conversion from in front of the posts, but was soon lining up a second after another scrum. Josh Adams came into the midfield from his wing, ran on to Biggar\u2019s inside pass and linked with Gareth Davies who cut in despite having the pace to make the line on the outside. Justin Tipuric picked up, sold dummies to two willing guards, and shimmied away.\n\nBy way of variation, the third try came from a lineout. Again Adams came off his wing undetected and swerved away from what passed for the defence on a 40-metre run to the line. The crowd made it a home match for Wales: while at least 1,000 had made the long trip, the bulk of those dressed in red were locals, enthusiastically cheering every break and score even though many would probably have struggled to locate the country on a map. The nickname of the Dragons fired interest and one woman proudly sported a Wales football jersey bearing one.\n\nSuch is the way the country has taken to a sport it is unfamiliar with. Georgia rallied in the third quarter to quieten the clamour, but one minute before the interval, Tipuric won a line-out, Gareth Davies looped around Ken Owens and Jonathan Davies cut the line before freeing Williams. Simple but deadly. A legacy of the work Howley did during the summer or a quick imprint of his replacement, Stephen Jones, who joined the squad four days before?\n\n\u201cThe plays were in place and the players executed a number of set-piece opportunities,\u201d said the Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, who took off a number of influential players early in the second half, starting with Gareth Davies, and that, along with the humidity which dampened the ball and a spirited revival by Georgia who tightened up and gained belief from an early try from a rolling maul from a lineout, made the second half less of a procession. Wales had partly turned their attention to the match against Australia on Saturday which will probably decide who finished at the top of the pool. Both played the role of iconoclasts in the opening round, Wales by spreading the ball quickly and often, the Wallabies by subduing lively opponents through mauling and grinding. \u201cIt was a performance that showed their experience,\u201d said Gatland, who was not minded to aim a missile in the direction of his opposite number, Michael Cheika, an indication of how quietly confident he is.\n\nHe will probably have to summon a replacement second row with Cory Hill having a fitness test on Tuesday having struggled to recover from a leg injury. \u201cHe is possibly out of the World Cup,\u201d said Gatland.\n\n\u201cWe will assess him tomorrow and if he is not right, he will go home.\u201d Gatland said that Ken Owens, who received treatment after hearing a click in his right knee following a heavy tackle, was not a concern, although when his captain Alun Wyn Jones made the same remark during the grand slam victory over Ireland in March, he did not play again for two months.\n\nOwens was taken off immediately after he received treatment and the game meandered to its conclusion. Wales scored two tries from counter-attacks and Georgia, who were fortunate that there was no review on a reckless challenge by Shalva Sutiashvili on George North which brought the wing clattering to the ground as he attempted to field a high kick and again exposed the inconsistency in the application of what is meant to be a stipulation, scored their second try after winning a scrum penalty.\n\nWales 43-14 Georgia: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nPlay Video 1:42 'We will get better' - Gatland insists Wales will improve after win against Georgia \u2013 video\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Josh Adams of Wales dives over to score with very little resistance.
