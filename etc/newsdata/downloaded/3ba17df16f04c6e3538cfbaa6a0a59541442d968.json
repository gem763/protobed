Voice assistants have become a staple feature in headphones, the industry has moved toward USB-C for charging, and we\u2019ve had countless versions of Bluetooth in the meantime, each bringing more incremental improvements in connectivity and sound quality.\n\nSo the arrival of the third-generation Sennheiser Momentum Wireless headphones (which I\u2019ll refer to as the Momentum 3 from here on) is kind of a big deal in headphone terms. The new headphones are still a premium set of cans at $400 (\u00a3349), but they\u2019re full of new features and tech that wouldn\u2019t have been possible four years ago. All these new additions combine to create a feature-packed pair of headphones that are also comfortable to wear, and which look every bit as stylish as Sennheiser\u2019s previous models. The only downside, which I\u2019ll get onto in a second, is that you can find headphones that sound better at this premium price point.\n\nOur review of Sennheiser Momentum Wireless (3rd Gen) Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Punchy, vibrant sound\n\nComfortable over long periods, even with glasses\n\nTile integration is handy\n\nUSB-C Bad Stuff Not the most refined sound at this price point\n\nAudio passthrough switch a little fiddly Buy for $399.99 from Sennheiser\n\nA lot has changed over the past four years of headphones, so let\u2019s start by listing off some of the ways in which these third-generation headphones have had to catch up. There\u2019s a new voice assistant activation button (Google Assistant and Alexa are both supported on Android, while Apple users are limited to Siri), a proximity sensor which automatically starts and stops your music depending on whether you\u2019re wearing the headphones, and they also use a USB-C port for charging. Thankfully Sennheiser has stuck with a traditional three-button layout to control volume and playback rather than switching to gesture controls as many other headphone makers have done. The buttons were reliable and easy to use in my testing.\n\nWhere things get a little more interesting is with the integration of Tile support, which allows you to use the Tile app to find your headphones if you lose them around your house. It\u2019s not an entirely new feature (we\u2019ve already seen Bose add it to its SoundSport headphones, for example), but it\u2019s still something that isn\u2019t common on most wireless headphones. It works like any other Tile device, which is to say that it works well for locating your headphones should you misplace them.\n\nRelated The best wireless headphones to buy right now\n\nAnother less unique trick the Momentum 3 have is that they try to automate certain actions based on when you\u2019re wearing the headphones or whether you\u2019ve got them safely stowed away. They do have wear detection (similar to other headphones like the Bowers & Wilkins PX Wireless), and also turn off automatically when you fold them down. In fact, folding the headphones like this is the only way to actually turn them off, since they don\u2019t have a traditional on / off button. Without a proper power button, there\u2019s no way to wear them around your neck without having them in standby mode, which meant that I forgot they were turned on and connected to my phone on more than one occasion. A little annoying.\n\nI should mention that you can turn off the \u201cSmart Pause\u201d setting in the app, which will stop the headphones from automatically playing music when they sense that you\u2019re wearing them. You can also use this app to adjust the EQ of the headphones, as well as other settings. By using this app, you\u2019re automatically opted in to sharing usage data, but you have the option of opting out in the privacy section of the app. There\u2019s no mention of Sennheiser collecting your information for marketing purposes, as one lawsuit claimed that Bose was doing.\n\nA companion app lets you adjust the EQ and turn off presence detection\n\nAll the features in the world wouldn\u2019t matter if the Momentum 3 don\u2019t sound good when you listen to them. Thankfully, they sound good \u2014 really good \u2014 and they\u2019re definitely in the same ballpark as Sony or Bowers & Wilkins\u2019 latest headphones. But the problem is that these headphones cost $400, and if you\u2019re prepared to spend that amount of money then I think you can technically get better sound quality elsewhere if that\u2019s your number one priority.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Sennheiser\u2019s latest headphones don\u2019t have anything going for them. They support Qualcomm\u2019s AptX standard, their bass has a nice punch and heft to it, there\u2019s no harshness or sibilance to the trebles, and all across the audio spectrum their sound is clear and balanced. Listen to a track where there\u2019s a lot going on, like \u201cLeviathan\u201d by Japanese jazz group Mouse on the Keys, and you\u2019re not going to lose track of any elements of the song, even as its drums and two pianos combine to form a barely coherent melody.\n\nHowever, the headphones never quite achieve the same refinement as the Bowers & Wilkins PX Wireless, which sound a touch more weighty and grounded to my ears. They\u2019re just more precise in how they deliver their sound. The overall sound separation offered by Bowers & Wilkins\u2019 noise-canceling headphones is also a hair\u2019s breadth better, which contributes to a wider soundstage. Listen to \u201cKnights of Cydonia\u201d by Muse on the Sennheiser Momentums, and something about it doesn\u2019t have that epic edge that you\u2019d hope to get from the song.\n\nThat said, Sennheiser\u2019s latest headphones are the much more comfortable pair to wear, with a nicely padded set of ear cups that meant that they put close to no pressure on my ears, even when I wore glasses while listening to them. This is something that Bowers & Wilkins\u2019 headphones sometimes struggle with. Despite the big cushions, Sennheiser\u2019s headphones didn\u2019t end up feeling too bulky, and still folded down into a compact package.\n\nThey\u2019re very comfortable to wear over long periods\n\nI also think they\u2019re a really great-looking pair of headphones, although for my money Sennheiser\u2019s headphones always look best in cream, rather than the black models that the company is leading with for these headphones. Sennheiser says that its new headphones will be available in \u201csand white\u201d from November.\n\nThe headphones\u2019 noise cancellation also holds up really nicely. I used them extensively on my commute through the London\u2019s rumbling and occasionally screeching Underground network, and they did a good job with both, even if they couldn\u2019t cut out either sound entirely. When I tried them out on a flight they were able to cut out the low rumble of the plane\u2019s engines completely, and significantly reduce the high-pitched sounds around me. This doesn\u2019t mean I was able to enjoy complete silence on my flight, but it was definitely enough to let me listen to podcasts and music without having to turn the volume up any louder than usual. You might technically get slightly better noise-cancellation from Sony or Bose, but Sennheiser\u2019s offering is more than good enough.\n\nThis is a minor point, but it was also nice to discover that the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless are very listenable with their noise-cancellation turned off. Some headphones, like AKG\u2019s N60 NC or Sennheiser\u2019s own HD1, don\u2019t let you turn off noise-cancellation at all, while the sound quality of others, like the Bowers & Wilkins PX Wireless, takes a nosedive whenever you do. If you\u2019re anything like me, then you\u2019re likely to do 90 percent of your listening with noise-cancellation turned on regardless, but it\u2019s nice to have the option of turning it off when you\u2019re walking along busy city streets.\n\nThe headphones also have an audio passthrough feature, which turns off your music and uses the headphones\u2019 microphones to amplify background sounds, in case you want to quickly listen out for external sounds like travel announcements. The feature works well, but it\u2019s a little harder to access than on Sony\u2019s latest headphones. Sony\u2019s headphones let you simply cup your hand to the headphones to turn on their passthrough feature, whereas Sennheiser\u2019s rely on you flipping a small switch, which can be harder to do quickly when you want to catch a train announcement. I also found myself turning off the noise-cancellation when I just wanted to turn off the ambient passthrough mode.\n\nAnnoyingly, Sennheiser\u2019s rated battery life for the third-generation Momentum Wireless has taken a bit of a dip compared to its last-generation headphones. The company claims you should get 16 hours of playback out of its latest headphones, compared to the 22 hours it quoted for prior models. However, I didn\u2019t find this to be a huge problem during my time with the headphones. I found I had to charge them twice over the two weeks I used them, during which I used them for numerous commutes and while making other journeys. In comparison, Bowers & Wilkins advertises that you\u2019ll get 22 hours from the PX Wireless, Sony says its WH-1000XM3 can do 30, and Bose quotes 20 hours for its QC 35 II.\n\nAside from the lack of a physical on / off button, the only other quibble I had with the headphones was that they use a 2.5mm connector when you want to plug in a physical cable. This might just be a personal thing, but I\u2019ve always found 3.5mm cables to be more widely available in a pinch, like when you show up at the airport and you\u2019ve forgotten the cable you need to plug your headphones into the in-flight entertainment system.\n\nThe Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3 are a great and much-needed update to Sennheiser\u2019s high-end wireless headphones. I really like their retro-inspired design, and they\u2019re comfortable to wear. It\u2019s also nice to see Sennheiser experiment with some newer features, even if it doesn\u2019t stick the landing on all of them. Tile support is a nice addition, for example, but I would have really liked to have seen a traditional on / off button in addition to being able to turn them off by collapsing them. If you\u2019ve been holding off on buying the current Sennheiser Momentums because of their slightly dated specs, then the new headphones are a great update.\n\nI\u2019d stop short of recommending these headphones to absolutely everyone, however, particularly if you\u2019re looking for the absolute best sound quality available. A $400 price point puts these headphones firmly into premium territory. For that money, if you\u2019re looking for the absolute best sound quality then I\u2019d sooner point you toward the Bowers & Wilkins PX Wireless, while anyone looking to maximize on noise-cancellation would do well to check out the latest from Sony or Bose.", "description": "The third-generation Sennheiser Momentum Wireless are full of new features and tech that create a feature-packed pair of headphones.
