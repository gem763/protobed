The chairman added that the Fed believed the current rate range would be \"appropriate\" to support the economy barring a major downturn.\n\n\"If something happens to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that's what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate stance of policy,\" Powell said. \"We don't see any evidence of that.\"\n\nI break down the Fed's decision here.\n\nAt a crossroads: While the Fed was widely expected to cut rates this month, the decision comes amid increasing concern that the central bank could soon run out of weapons to fight a recession.\n\nThe U.S. economy has slowed steadily throughout 2019 after a burst of growth last year.\n\nU.S. gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.9 percent in the third quarter, while average monthly job gains have fallen from 223,000 in 2018 to 161,000 in 2019.\n\nThe upcoming October jobs report, scheduled to be released Friday, is also expected to show paltry employment gains due in part to the 40-day strike at General Motors plants that began Sept. 15.\n\nAnd business investment in equipment and structures, manufacturing output, and exports have all fallen sharply as fading global growth cuts into foreign demand for U.S goods and services.\n\nBut critics of the Fed's approach argue that with interest rates already close to stimulatory levels, another rate cut will deprive the Fed of crucial fuel to power the economy through a severe downturn.\n\nPowell's defense: Powell tamped down fear that the declines in business investment and expansion would soon cut into a 3.5 percent unemployment rate, a 50-year low. The chairman argued that the consumer-side of the economy has largely been insulated from headwinds challenging businesses.\n\n\"The consumer-facing companies that we talked to in our vast network of contacts report that consumers are doing well and are focused on the good job market and rising incomes,\" Powell said.\n\n\"We see the economy as having been resilient to the headwinds that have been blowing this year.\"\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nUS economy grew at 1.9 percent in third quarter, holding steady amid recession fears:\n\nThe U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.9 percent in the third quarter of 2019, upending expectations of a sharp slowdown driven by a global economic slump and the rising costs of trade tensions.\n\nU.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 1.9 percent between July and September, according to data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.1 percent in the second quarter, 3.2 percent in the first quarter and 2.9 percent in all of 2018.\n\nTrump touted \u201cThe Greatest Economy in American History!\u201d in a tweet less than an hour before the highly protected GDP data was released. I break down the full report here.\n\nThe good: While 1.9 percent is far below the 3 percent growth rate President Trump Donald John TrumpNumber of uninsured children rises for second year, tops 4 million Trump moment from White House Halloween trick-or-treat event goes viral White House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report MORE promised during his 2016 campaign, economists had largely projected GDP growth to slump as low as 1.3 percent.\n\nConsumer spending, which powers 70 percent of the economy, grew at a solid rate of 2.9 percent in the third quarter, though well below a 4.6 percent spike in the second quarter.\n\nExports also reversed a steep 5.7 percent decline in the second quarter to rise 0.7 percent in the third, while residential investment also rebounded from a 3 percent decline in the second quarter to a 5.1 percent increase in the third.\n\nThe bad: Even so, business investment in structures and equipment continued to decline, reflecting an ongoing U.S. manufacturing recession and the unwillingness of businesses to expand amid global economic tensions.\n\nChile backs out of hosting APEC summit, adding uncertainty to US-China trade deal:\n\nChile will no longer host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit next month amid widespread unrest in the country, President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era announced Wednesday, adding uncertainty to a trade agreement between the U.S. and China.\n\nPresident Trump was among the world leaders expected to attend the gathering in Santiago on Nov. 16 and 17.\n\nTrump said as recently as Monday that he planned to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping there to sign phase one of a trade deal between the two countries.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the summit would be called off altogether or held in a different location.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement that it did not appear there was a secondary site prepared to host APEC in light of Chile's announcement. He downplayed any impact the change might have on the signing of the China trade deal, which the two sides are still negotiating.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nAP: \u201cTrump's Rust Belt revival is fading. Will it matter in 2020?\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post: \u201cIn China's capital of Halloween slime and ooze, the trade war is a scary subject\u201d\n\nMolson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley said Wednesday that the company will undergo a massive restructuring across North America, cutting hundreds of jobs and merging its Canadian, U.S. and Latin American brands into one company.\n\nODDS AND ENDS", "description": "Happy Wednesday and welcome back to On The Money.
