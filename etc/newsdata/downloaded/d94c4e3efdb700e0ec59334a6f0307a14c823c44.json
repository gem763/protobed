It\u2019s far too early to make claims like that.\"\n\nA City fan said \"We heard all this craic last season\" - referring to the fact that many observers were handing Liverpool the title when Guardiola's side fell seven points behind last December.\n\nAnother tweeted: \"How exactly do Liverpool have to lose 5 if they beat @ManCity and we lose another? Not heard of draws?\"", "description": "Former Arsenal star reckons City can forget about defending crown if they lose at Anfield next month", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20078441.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Aston-Villa-v-Middlesbrough-Sky-Bet-Championship-Play-Off-Semi-Final-Second-Leg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
