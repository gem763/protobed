It is not white nationalism to recognize limiting principles on liberal universalism, and a justifiable role for particularity \u2014 ethnic, cultural, religious \u2014 in many political arrangements. A sprawling multiethnic republic like the present United States is an admirable thing, to be defended against ethnic Balkanization and racist chauvinism alike. But our democratic imperium is not the only legitimate form of political order, and a society does not automatically become illiberal or racist or authoritarian just because it retains an established church or allows a right of return or maintains a preference for a particular language.\n\nParticularism can lead to chauvinism and cruelty, certainly, and there\u2019s room to criticize Israel or any other nation on those grounds. But liberal universalism is no panacea either: It can overreach and impose an oppressive uniformity, or overreach and simply self-destruct. The self-determination of specific tribes and peoples and traditions \u2014 be they Polish, Kurdish, Tibetan or Jewish \u2014 can be as necessary to human liberty in some cases as a push toward cosmopolitanism is in others. And insofar as universalists of different sorts \u2014 liberal Eurocrats, Bush-era neoconservatives \u2014 have gone terribly astray recently in ignoring the role of difference in human affairs, a healthy conservatism has to correct for this error even as it resists the pull of bigotry.\n\nThen move to Vance\u2019s plea for pro-natalism and higher American birthrates. It is not white nationalism to believe that countries like the United States would be better off with more babies. That belief can be held for racist reasons by racists, but it can also be held, reasonably and righteously, by people who worry about the economic consequences of demographic decline \u2026 or by people who worry about the social consequences of shrinking family trees and a widespread unfulfilled desire for kids \u2026 or by people who regard a higher birthrate as a cure for ethnic division because it actually makes assimilating immigrants easier \u2026 or by people who just think babies are good and societies that can easily afford to rear more of them should do so.\n\nIn reality, far from being creepily obsessed with birthrates, conservatism actually failed America over the last generation by paying insufficient attention to the economics of child rearing and the natural family\u2019s strange decline. And a healthy post-Trump conservatism must be more pro-natalist or it will not be at all.\n\nThen move to Fairbanks\u2019s critique of the supposed \u201cConfederate\u201d style in center-right pleas for intellectual diversity. It is not white nationalism to believe that growing ideological uniformity in the commanding heights of culture makes American politics more polarized. That belief can be expressed in whiny or self-pitying fashion, sure, and it can be expressed in ways that ignore the political power that conservatism obviously wields, sometimes to tremendously ill effect. But fundamentally, it does not rebut the people Fairbanks absurdly analogizes to slaveholders, the people who worry about the ideological monoculture on campuses or the power of groupthink in elite newsrooms, to say, \u201cDonald Trump is president, what are you complaining about?\u201d \u2014 not least because Donald Trump is president in part because of a toxic interaction between the left\u2019s cultural power and the right\u2019s bunker mentality!\n\nOf course conservatism\u2019s concern about its own exclusion from cultural influence is self-interested. (How could it not be?) But that exclusion is still real, and no serious post-Trump conservatism could stop challenging and critiquing it \u2014 both for the right\u2019s own sake and for the sake of escaping our present political-cultural derangement.", "description": "Conservatism\u2019s racism problem is real.
