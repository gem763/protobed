But when a Korean golfer named Bio Kim \u201cgave the finger\u201d to a crowd watching him tee off after someone\u2019s cellphone rang, he was suspended from play for a whopping three years.\n\nKim, 29, was also fined the equivalent of $8,350. He appealed the suspension given out by the Korean Professional Golfers\u2019 Association (KPGA), and it reduced the suspension to one year.\n\nThe Korean PGA is not affiliated with the PGA Tour in the U.S., which said in a statement: \u201cBio Kim does not currently have status on any PGA TOUR-affiliated Tours. However, he would be eligible to attempt to Monday qualify for events starting in January.\u201d\n\nMarketWatch took a look at how Kim\u2019s suspension compared with what other sports have meted out for similar acts.\n\nNFL quarterback Michael Vick\n\nPunishment: $20,000\n\nPerhaps the most high-profile middle finger situation. Atlanta Falcons QB Vick was at the peak of his powers in 2006, but a blowout loss to his rival New Orleans Saints led his home crowd to boo him as he walked off the field. Vick gave his home fans not one, but two middle fingers. That \u2018obscene gesture\u2019 cost Vick $20,000 and it didn\u2019t help that the whole thing was caught on camera.\n\nNFL safety Malcolm Jenkins\n\nPunishment: $13,469\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins believed New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton was running up the score during a regular season game in 2018. A frustrated Jenkins flashed his middle finger in Payton\u2019s direction, a move that reportedly cost him $13,369\n\nNBA forward DeMarcus Cousins\n\nPunishment: $25,000\n\nDeMarcus \u201cBoogie\u201d Cousins has the highest dollar amount fine on this list, and for good reason. After a heartbreaking loss to the Golden State Warriors in 2017, Cousins approached the locker room and screamed \u201cFuck Golden State!\u201d and gestured two middle fingers toward a group of fans.\n\nThe combination of what the NBA called \u201can inappropriate statement and gesture\u201d earned Cousins a hefty $25,000 fine.\n\nNBA center Myles Turner\n\nPunishment: $15,000\n\nIndiana Pacers center Myles Turner was subbed out of a regular season game against the Philadelphia 76ers when he got caught up in the \u201cheat of the moment.\u201d Turner flipped off the booing Philly crowd as he walked to the bench in frustration. Turner was likely upset because 76ers center Joel Embiid went off for 40 points and 21 rebounds that night \u2014 he was fined $15,000 by the NBA.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that simply \u201cbooing\u201d is about the least egregious thing Philly fans have ever done.\n\nMLB outfielder Yasiel Puig\n\nPunishment: suspended for 1 game; undisclosed fine\n\nWhen he was on the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017, Puig gave the finger to Cleveland Indians fans with both hands. He was suspended and fined an undisclosed amount. \u201cIt was something that he wishes didn\u2019t happen,\u201d his manager said the next day. \u201cIt was a reaction of emotion on his part. Bad judgment.\u201d\n\nTennis player Daniil Medvedev\n\nPunishment: $4,000\n\nProfessional tennis player Daniil Medvedev was fined $4,000 for pressing his middle finger against the side of his head during a U.S. Open match in 2019. Medvedev had been the subject of a series of fines throughout the U.S. Open ranging from verbal abuse of referees to other unsportsmanlike conduct. Throughout the tournament fans booed Medvedev, and he sarcastically said it helped him win. But when he played an impressive final against Rafael Nadal and lost in five close sets, he won the crowd back to his side.\n\nAthletes raising their middle finger seems to have a long history. A picture of one Charles \u201cOld Hoss\u201d Radborun appears to show him making the gesture in a photo of his team, the 1886 Boston Beaneaters. He\u2019s reportedly the first person to be pictured giving the middle finger.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the league levied any punishment on Radborun for his conduct.", "description": "Bio Kim of the Korean PGA was originally suspended for three years.
