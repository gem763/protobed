Banks globally have been left holding parts of loans that funded at least seven private-equity deals, and Barclays was a lead underwriter on four of them.\n\n\u201cIf you have a deal that\u2019s not structured properly, that has some idiosyncratic weaknesses to it, the market can be pretty punishing at the bottom end,\u201d said Staley.\n\nBanks typically arrange leveraged loans to fund acquisitions for private-equity companies yet they\u2019re rarely forced to come up with the cash themselves, instead selling on the debts to investors before deals close. The industry has surged in an era of rock-bottom interest rates -- and Staley has targeted the business as an area for growth -- yet it has begun showing some signs of stress amid fears of an economic slowdown and has prompted warnings from regulators.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a market that you have to have your eyes open to, you can still get the strong deals done,\u201d Staley said. \u201cWe\u2019re very comfortable with our portfolio, with our performance in the third quarter, but a couple of idiosyncratic deals have opened people\u2019s eyes that it\u2019s not a free ride right now.\u201d\n\nTwo of the troubled deals -- for invoice processing company OSG Billing Services and kitchen-cabinet maker ACProducts -- were underwritten before a sell-off in the market last year. Barclays, the sole underwriter on both, is still holding around half of each financing, Bloomberg reported.\n\nBarclays has arranged about $16.2 billion of new U.S. leveraged-loan deals so far this year, dropping two places to fifth among underwriters compared with 2018, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The U.K. bank\u2019s team has had a \u201cvery good year,\u201d Staley said.\n\n--With assistance from Ruth McGavin.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Donal Griffin in London at dgriffin10@bloomberg.net;Davide Scigliuzzo in New York at dscigliuzzo2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Vivianne Rodrigues at vrodrigues3@bloomberg.net, Chris Vellacott, Marion Dakers\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Barclays Plc Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley, whose bank is among lenders sitting on $2 billion of risky corporate loans they\u2019re struggling to sell, has warned of the dangers of poorly assembled deals.Buyers of leveraged loans are shunning transactions that aren\u2019t \u201cstructured properly", "authors": ["Donal Griffin", "Davide Scigliuzzo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZKYGnR9vPaD4HO2STePtdg--~B/aD0xMDM2O3c9MTYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/ddb64c56c885f2a60715c2b51e0c5689", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
