Neal Maupay is no Robert Lewandowski, Maty Ryan is no Manuel Neuer, and Aaron Connolly was never expected to do what Serge Gnabry did in that 7-2 demolition.\n\nYet they had Tottenham's number all the same here. They embarrassed Mauricio Pochettino's men, ensuring a stein or two would be raised to this result in East Sussex on Saturday evening.\n\nThose present at the Amex Stadium got the party started early, singing 'we want seven, we want seven'. The oles rang round as Brighton caressed the ball from man to man with the game won.\n\nBrighton youngster Aaron Connolly slots in a delicious third goal - his second - curled beautifully into the bottom corner\n\nThe 19-year-old takes the acclaim of the home supporters at the Amex Stadium after a man-of-the-match performance\n\nEarlier, Hugo Lloris screams in pain after falling awkwardly on his left arm in the process of conceding the first goal\n\nThe horrific injury was sustained in the third minute and Lloris was given oxygen as he was taken off the pitch on a stretcher\n\nMATCH FACTS Brighton (4-4-2): Ryan 8; Montoya 8, Webster 8.5, Dunk 8.5, Burn 8.5; Gross 8, Alzate 8 (Bong 88min), Stephens 8 (Murray 90), Mooy 8; Maupay 8.5, Connolly 9 (Bissouma 80). Booked: Stephens, Dunk. Subs (not used): Button, Balogun, Jahanbakhsh, March. Tottenham (4-2-3-1): Lloris 4.5 (Gazzaniga 8, 4); Sissoko 4, Alderweireld 4, Vertonghen 4, Davies 4.5; Dier 4.5, Ndombele 4 (Winks 45, 4.5); Lamela 4, Eriksen 3.5, Son 3.5 (Moura 73); Kane 3.5. Booked: Dier. Subs (not used): Sanchez, Alli, Foyth, Skipp. Referee: J Moss (West Yorkshire) 6.\n\nTheir supporters even serenaded Pochettino with chants of 'you're getting sacked in the morning'. Tongue in cheek, but the Argentine cannot have endured many worse weeks as a manager than this.\n\nBefore the dissections of Tottenham begin, however, we must first applaud Brighton. The last time they scored more than once in a league game? December 2018, against Crystal Palace.\n\nThis win was largely down to Connolly, the 19-year-old from Galway making his full Premier League debut. His second goal was remarkably similar to Gnabry's first on Tuesday \u2013 both running from the left at Toby Alderweireld, both cutting on to their right foots, both scoring into the far corner.\n\nWas that by design? 'Coincidence,' Graham Potter said. 'I tend to not say to my players, \"Be Bayern Munich\".' Even so, it was impressive, and Connolly formed a fine centre-forward partnership with Maupay, who opened the scoring.\n\nIt was a howler by Tottenham's goalkeeper and captain Hugo Lloris which led to that goal inside three minutes, though what happened next churned stomachs inside the Amex.\n\nPascal Gross sent an in-swinging cross from the left towards the back post and a routine catch from Lloris was expected. Yet the backtracking Frenchman fumbled the ball, leaving it for Maupay to nod into an empty net. While Brighton celebrated, Lloris stayed down.\n\nBrighton forward Neal Maupay was the beneficiary of Lloris' mistake, and tapped into an empty net from close range\n\nLloris received attention very quickly from Tottenham's medical staff as well as paramedics present at the Amex Stadium\n\nAt first, you thought he did not dare get up because of embarrassment. Not so. It was because as he landed, his left arm bent backwards, leaving him in excruciating pain.\n\nOne particular replay, shown on the Amex's big screen, showed the moment it appeared to snap. It drew a gasp from the crowd, and that clip was not shown again.\n\nAfter five minutes of medical attention, Lloris was carried off on a stretcher, inhaling oxygen and with a doctor supporting his arm. Paulo Gazzaniga came off the bench.\n\nTottenham's horrific week had just got worse. Pochettino, stood with arms folded, looked positively fed up.\n\nBrighton went into this having scored five Premier League goals this season, and three of those came on the opening day. They had been creating chances, but not finishing them off.\n\nConnolly taps in Brighton's second midway through the first half after keeper Paulo Gazzaniga had saved his first effort\n\nConnolly was fortunate the ball deflected back to him and the Irishman couldn't miss three yards from goal\n\nThe Brighton players celebrate Connolly's second goal and their third of the afternoon which made the three points secure\n\nTottenham's Toby Alderweireld, Tanguy Ndombele and Erik Lamela look despondent after Brighton's second goal\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nSo into the starting line-up came Connolly, the young forward born in the year 2000. After 32 minutes, the teenager marked his first start in the top flight with a goal.\n\nA cross from the left came in from Dan Burn and Connolly got to it first. His initial shot was saved by Gazzaniga, but he was back on his feet in a flash to finish the rebound.\n\nSuddenly, Tottenham were trailing 2-0. Can we call it a crisis now? Brighton's supporters think so, as those first hints at Pochettino being given the boot began to emerge.\n\nMoussa Sissoko, the midfielder being used at right back, had suffered a challenging half of football. Both of Brighton's goals had originated from the side he was tasked with manning.\n\nAfter 43 minutes, we witnessed something rare \u2013 a Tottenham chance. Son Heung-min and Harry Kane led a breakaway. The ball was spread to Erik Lamela. He had a go, but Lewis Dunk got back to clear off the line.\n\nHarry Kane, who took over as captain after Lloris' injury, motions to Lamela as Spurs tried to find a way back into the game\n\nChristian Eriksen, who was linked with a move away from Tottenham all summer, again struggled to find his form at Brighton\n\nIt was a day to forget for Kane too, after the England forward missed a glorious chance to score with his left-foot\n\nTottenham's Son Heung-min looks dejected during the 3-0 defeat at Brighton on Saturday afternoon\n\nAt half time, Pochettino took off \u00a354million Tanguy Ndombele and on came Harry Winks. Yet still, Brighton pushed for a third. When out of possession, they pressed. When in it, they asked questions.\n\nOn the hour mark, Gross rattled the crossbar with a free-kick from the left. Moments later, it was 3-0, and game over. Connolly ran at Alderweireld, who looked like a lost puppy. The Brighton striker could see where he wanted the ball to go, and he duly found the far corner. A fine finish.\n\nOnce again, those chants came out: 'We want seven.' Followed by: 'Sacked in the morning.'\n\nIn the 70th minute, Kane could and should have scored. He cut on to his left foot, sending one defender to the shops, but then fired his subsequent shot over the crossbar. Not his day, and not Tottenham's.\n\nHow do you get over a 7-2 defeat at home to the champions of Germany? Not like this, that's for sure.", "description": "KIERAN GILL AT THE AMEX STADIUM: Brighton are no Bayern Munich.
