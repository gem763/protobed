It's a well-mannered creature and clearly doesn't want to be handled.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's no threat to anyone but we are concerned if it gets loose on the highway.\"\n\nThe animal was seen at a bed and breakfast in the county but is believed to have wandered to the mountains.\n\nDeb Verplank, the owner of Orchard House Bed and Breakfast became invested in the story of Meteor after he was spotted in her gardens.\n\nShe said: \"I didn't even know what a yak was until he turned up. He was so brazen. The farmer has left his trailer here so we are hoping he is found alive.\"\n\n\"I really think Meteor knew what was going on and where he was headed and decided it wasn't for him.\"\n\nMr Cissell said if Meteor was returned, he would have to be kept alive now that he was a celebrity.\n\nHowever, he did add: \"As a small family farm, it will be a loss to our family's situation.\"", "description": "A yak described as \"aloof\" is loose somewhere in Virginia after escaping transport to the butchers.", "authors": ["Dhruti Shah", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/48E4/production/_108806681_yak1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
