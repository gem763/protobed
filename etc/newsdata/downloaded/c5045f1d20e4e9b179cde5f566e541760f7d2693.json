Khalilzad was unavailable for comment.\n\nIt was not the Afghan government's misgivings that sank the deal - U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly canceled secret talks with the Taliban at his Camp David retreat that were planned for Sept. 8 and has since said the talks are \"dead\".\n\nBut for the Afghan government, that may be an opportunity get back in the game and shape the future direction of the peace process.\n\nA presidential election, which the Taliban and even many Western officials had wanted to cancel to focus on sealing the peace accord, is now expected to go ahead on Sept. 28. Ghani is favorite to win, leaving him well-placed to claim a popular mandate to set the terms of any new agreement with the Taliban.\n\n\"Now, the management of the peace process, its planning and implementation is the sole duty of the government of Afghanistan,\" Ghani told an election rally last week. \"I will implement that.\"\n\nThe Taliban has vowed to violently disrupt the election and on Tuesday killed nearly 50 people in twin suicide bombings, one targeting a Ghani election rally.\n\n\n\n\n\nFUTURE TALKS?\n\nAfghan officials say the view in Kabul was that the U.S. deal offered too many concessions to the Taliban while getting nothing in return, and left the Afghan government, supposedly America's ally, swinging in the wind.\n\nThe disagreement illustrates the deep split that developed between the United States and the government over any peace deal and underlines how hard it has been for them to present a united front in dealing with Taliban negotiators.\n\nThe deal's collapse has also damaged the credibility of Khalilzad, say Afghan officials and Western diplomats in Kabul who have been following the talks closely. His future is now in doubt and it is still unclear whether talks can be revived.\n\nThe State Department declined to respond to requests for comment on Reuters' questions concerning the future of the talks and the criticisms of the draft deal.\n\nThe commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan has said the Taliban \"overplayed their hand\" in the negotiations and that the pace of U.S. military operations was likely to pick up.\n\nTrump's decision to fire his hawkish National Security Adviser John Bolton has added a further complication, and some in Washington fear the election will make it harder for talks to be revived before next year's U.S. presidential election.\n\nIf talks are resumed, Ghani's officials say Khalilzad's format of holding separate negotiations with the Taliban as a preliminary step to later talks between Afghan participants in the conflict cannot be repeated.\n\nInstead, the government will press for a sequence that would see a ceasefire followed by direct talks with the Taliban, leading to credible security guarantees. Only then would U.S. troops be withdrawn.\n\n\"The government needs to be on board if there is a deal in the future,\" the Afghan official said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"MAJOR FAILURE\"\n\nUnder the draft accord, some 5,000 American troops would be withdrawn in exchange for assurances that Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks against the United States and its allies. That would leave roughly 9,000 stationed there.", "description": "Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had no more than 20 minutes to study a draft accord between the United States and the Taliban on pulling thousands of U.S. troops out of his country, but upcoming elections could put him back at the heart of talks to end decades of war.
