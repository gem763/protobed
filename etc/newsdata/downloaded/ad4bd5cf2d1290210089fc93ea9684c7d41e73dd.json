The Nationals also gained homefield advantage as the best-of-5 series moves to Washington for Game 3 on Sunday and Game 4 on Monday.\n\nThe Dodgers threatened in the ninth inning with Daniel Hudson on the mound. He was able to strike out Corey Seager with the bases loaded to earn the save.\n\nOn Friday at Dodger Stadium, the Nationals took advantage of a shaky Clayton Kershaw, jumping out to a 3-0 after two innings. Then it was a matter of holding on as the Dodgers cut the deficit to 3-2 in the bottom of the seventh.\n\nStephen Strasburg held the Dodgers offense to one run.

Well, so much for that, so we think.\n\nWith the Nationals clinging to a 4-2 lead heading into the eighth inning, Nationals manager Davey Martinez brought in Scherzer. Wise move.\n\nScherzer retired the Dodgers in order in the eighth by striking out the side.\n\nCLAYTON CURSE-SHAW?\n\nIs it a postseason curse that unsettles Clayton Kershaw, the three-time Cy Young Award winner who entered game with a 4.32 ERA in 30 playoff appearances? Or just postseason anxiety? There was yet more reason to wonder after witnessing this:\n\nDuring 178 1/3 innings pitched during the regular season, Kershaw hit just two batters. On Friday, he managed to equal that total in just two innings \u2014 plunking Juan Soto in the first and nailing Victor Robles in the second. It was part of more postseason misadventures for Kershaw, who allowed seven of the first 12 batters he faced to reach base.\n\nSomehow Kershaw escaped those two shaky innings while allowing just three runs. More impressively, he retired nine of the next 10 batters and exited after six innings of semi-adequate postseason pitching.\n\nVINTAGE: Verlander has another masterful postseason start\n\nLA's NEW ACE? Buehler validates he can handle the big stage\n\nBREAKING IT UP\n\nOK, maybe it\u2019s a tad early to be tracking potential no-hitters with two outs in the fifth inning. So forgive us as we report .. Will Smith, the Dodgers\u2019 rookie catcher, broke up Strasburg\u2019s no-hit bid with two outs in the bottom of the fifth. For the record, there have been only two no-hitters in major league baseball's postseason history \u2014 Don Larsen\u2019s perfect game for the Dodgers against the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series and Roy Halladay\u2019s no-hitter for the Philadelphia Phillies against the the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series.\n\nThere seemed to be a glimmer of hope of a third postseason no-hitter when Strasburg struck out Cody Bellinger and Max Muncy for the first two outs of the fifth inning as the Dodgers\u2019 offense looked lifeless. But then up stepped Smith, the baby-faced 24-year-old who laced a 2-2 change to center for a single that ended the no-hit bid.\n\nMAY IN OCTOBER?\n\nIt was mildly surprising that rookie pitcher Dustin May made the Dodgers\u2019 NL Division Series. On Friday, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts demonstrated he\u2019s not afraid to use the redheaded reliever in significant situations \u2014 such as top of the seventh, bases loaded with two out and the Dodgers trailing 3-1.\n\nHow\u2019d it work out? May threw five pitches to veteran Howie Kendrick before inducing Kendrick into a weak ground.", "description": "Nationals' Stephen Strasburg took a perfect game into the fifth inning against the Dodgers.
