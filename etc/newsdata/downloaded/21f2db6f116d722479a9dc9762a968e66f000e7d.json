A country sitting on a peninsula, Korea has a long naval tradition, despite being a \u201cshrimp\u201d between the two \u201cwhales\u201d of China and Japan. However, the partitioning of Korea into two countries in 1945 and the stated goal of unification \u2014by force if necessary\u2014lent the country to building up a large army, and reserving the navy for interdiction and special operations roles. Now, in the twenty-first century, the country\u2019s navy is set to be the sea arm of a substantial nuclear deterrent.\n\nThe Korean People\u2019s Navy (KPN) is believed to have approximately sixty thousand men under arms\u2014less than one-twentieth that of the Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA) ground forces. This, as well as comparable budget makes the KPN\u2019s auxiliary role to the KPA. KPN draftees spend an average of five to ten years, so while Pyongyang\u2019s sailors may not have the latest equipment, they do end up knowing their jobs quite well.\n\nA substantial number of these sailors serve in the KPN\u2019s submarine fleet, which is one of the world\u2019s largest. In 2001, North Korea analyst Joseph Bermudez estimated that the KPN operated between fifty-two and sixty-seven diesel electric submarines. These consisted of four Whiskey-class submarines supplied by the Soviet Union and up to seventy-seven Romeo-class submarines provided by China. Seven Romeos were delivered assembled, while the rest were delivered in kit form. Each Romeo displaced 1,830 tons submerged, had a top speed of thirteen knots and was operated by a crew of fifty-four. The Romeo submarines were armed with eight standard-diameter 533-millimeter torpedo tubes, two facing aft. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was filmed touring and taking a short voyage on a Romeo-class submarine in 2014.\n\nDespite such an endorsement, the submarines are generally considered obsolete and are being phased out. In 2015, the Pentagon believed that North Korea has seventy submarines of unknown types on active duty. A multinational report on the sinking of the South Korean corvette ROKS Cheonan states that the KPN operated twenty Romeo-class submarines, forty Sang-O (\u201cShark\u201d) class coastal submarines (SSCs), and ten midget submarines of the Yono class.\n\nThe Sang-O class of coastal submarines is approximately 111 feet long and twelve feet wide, and displaces 275 tons. It can do 7.2 knots surfaced and 8.8 knots submerged. There are two versions, one with torpedo tubes and another where the torpedo tubes are replaced with lockout chambers for divers. The latter are maintained by the KPN but operated by the Reconnaissance Bureau\u2019s Maritime Department. An improved version, informally known as the Sang-O II, is 131 feet long, displaces between 350 and 400 tons, and reportedly has a top speed of thirteen knots. The armed variant is believed to be capable of carrying, in addition to torpedoes, sea mines, while the Reconnaissance Bureau\u2019s version carries between thirty-five and forty passengers and crew.\n\nFinally, North Korea has about ten Yono-class midget submarines (SSm). Derived from an Iranian design, the Yono class displaces 130 tons submerged, with two 533-millimeter torpedo tubes and a crew of approximately twenty. The submarine can make an estimated eleven knots on the surface, but only four knots submerged.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s submarine fleet, while smaller and less well funded than the other armed services, has generated an outsized number of international incidents. On September 18, 1996, a Sang-O SSC operated by the Reconnaissance Bureau ran aground near Gangneung, South Korea. The submarine, which had set a three-man party of commandos ashore two days before to reconnoiter a South Korean naval base, had failed to pick up the party the the previous night. On its second attempt, the submarine ran aground and became hopelessly stuck within sight of the shoreline.\n\nAboard the submarine were twenty-one crew and and the director and vice director of the Maritime Department. South Korean airborne and special-forces troops embarked on a forty-nine-day manhunt that saw all of the North Koreans except for one killed or captured. Many committed suicide or were murdered by their superior officers to prevent capture. The remaining North Korean sailor, or agent, is believed to have made his way back across the DMZ. Eight ROK troops were killed, as were four South Korean civilians.", "description": "So which is it?", "authors": ["Kyle Mizokami"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YMtRZS0Sj9c2iq_W9Jq9mw--~B/aD05NTk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/ba6dbc82e48082513df909b24d4e818f"}
