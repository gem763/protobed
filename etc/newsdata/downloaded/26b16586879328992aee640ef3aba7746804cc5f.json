Sign up here.\n\nChina\u2019s policy makers are preparing for two key policy meetings in the coming weeks with fresh evidence that sooner rather than later, the number for gross domestic product growth will start with a 5.\n\nData released Friday showed an economy expanding at just 6.0%, the slowest in almost three decades, and with broad investment growth too tepid to rely on an upturn down the road.\n\nPeople\u2019s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang responded to the data not by hinting at much greater stimulus in the pipeline, but by reminding investors that China\u2019s focus remains on keeping its heavy debt load under control.\n\nYi\u2019s comments may set the scene for a meeting of the Politburo, the Communist Party\u2019s top leaders, and the ensuing Fourth Plenum of the Party\u2019s Central Committee, a broader gathering that may mull longer-term questions of economic policy. While those events could produce a shift away from the current targeted, moderate stimulus regime, there have been few signals to date of any change.\n\nThe leaders are \u201clooking at a very long horizon,\u201d and that approach makes the headline growth rate -- either above 6% or slightly below it -- not that important, Yao Wei, chief China economist at Societe Generale SA in Paris, said in an interview on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meetings in Washington last week.\n\n\u201cThey measure the policy scope by looking at the overall debt, by looking at how much risk there is in shadow banking, in the housing sector and in inflation,\u201d Yao said. \u201cLooking at all these things, they judge they actually don\u2019t have much scope from a long-term perspective. So they\u2019re very careful about how to use it and when to use it.\u201d\n\nGrowth volatility is acceptable if other targets on employment, income and environmental protection are met, according to the top economic planning agency. China is facing downward pressure and challenges, but the country is able to meet major economic targets for this year, the National Development and Reform Commission\u2019s spokesman Yuan Da said Monday.\n\nIn the first three quarters of 2019, there were 10.97 million new urban jobs created, 99.7% of the target for the full year, according to the Statistics Bureau.\n\nWith few major monetary policy moves in the past month, the Loan Prime Rate, a market gauge of borrowing costs, remained unchanged in October, according to a PBOC release Monday.\n\nIn his statement to the IMF\u2019s steering committee at the meetings, Yi said that growth had been stable this year and the \u201cmain economic indicators kept within an appropriate range.\u201d While keeping credit growing, the bank should also pay attention to \u201cmaintaining a stabilized leverage ratio,\u201d he said.\n\nYi won support for China\u2019s approach from the IMF, which otherwise has been urging more action to support the global economy. Kenneth Kang, deputy director of the fund\u2019s Asia and Pacific Department, said any support to prop up the Chinese economy should be \u201ccontained, calibrated to the shock, it should be temporary in nature and it should be focusing on re-balancing growth down the road.\u201d\n\nStabilization Signs?\n\nEven though the third quarter growth numbers came in below estimates, policy makers may in fact be seeing signs of a stabilization, particularly if the nascent trade-war truce with the U.S. holds.\n\nCorporate demand for long-term credit picked up in recent months, the growth of auto sales -- an important part of the country\u2019s retail sales -- contracted less, and infrastructure investment stabilized at a low level. These factors are among those that have prompted economists from Citigroup Inc, Barclays Plc, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd, and Natwest Markets Plc to cautiously call a bottoming-out.\n\n\u201cThe positive factors such as the trade truce, low base effect, the stabilization of manufacturing sector and pickup of infrastructure investment may give the PBOC more reason to take a wait and see approach,\u201d Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., wrote in a note.\n\nTo be sure, if conditions were to worsen materially from here, China still has ample room to react, with interest rates far above zero. Before last week\u2019s growth data, economists surveyed by Bloomberg saw full-year expansion for 2019 coming in at 6.2% before slowing to 5.9% in 2020.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
