Things were no different Friday at UFC on ESPN 6.\n\nHardy (5-1 MMA, 2-1 UFC) pulled off what was seemingly a first in UFC history when, between the second and third round of his heavyweight fight with Ben Sosoli, he used an inhaler. The former NFL standout went on to a unanimous decision win, but there was immediate outrage and questions after what transpired..\n\nOnce the event, which took place at TD Garden in Boston, came to a conclusion, the UFC announced Hardy\u2019s win had been overturned to a no contest due to the inhaler use. Hardy believes he did nothing wrong because he asked a Massachusetts State Athletic Commission official in the octagon if he could use the inhaler, citing U.S. Anti-Doping Agency approval.\n\nThat ultimately proved false, with Hardy\u2019s victory being changed to a no contest, much to his dismay.\n\n\u201c(I\u2019m) super sad,\u201d Hardy told reporters, including MMA Junkie, post-fight at UFC on ESPN 6. \u201cIt\u2019s a ventolin albuterol inhaler for exercise-induced asthma. I used it my whole life. I sign the commission paperwork when I weighed in. It\u2019s on the USADA paperwork when I take every single drug test so that y\u2019all know that I\u2019m not taking steroids. I\u2019m just naturally a monster.\u201d\n\nFootage of the inhaler usage that led to Greg Hardy's win being overturned and declared a No Contest #UFCBoston pic.twitter.com/qmZ8KtXyVO \u2014 ESPN MMA (@espnmma) October 19, 2019\n\nUFC president Dana White was at a loss for words over the entire situation. He understands how it unfolded when watching the footage back, but he put the onus on Hardy\u2019s chief corner, Din Thomas from American Top Team, for not having awareness that use of the inhaler would be illegal.\n\n\u201cI think if you watch it you can understand how it happened,\u201d White said. \u201cBut he asked the guy, and the guy said, \u2018Is it medically approved?\u2019 And he said, \u2018It\u2019s USADA approved.\u2019 Because he put it down on his sheet that he was using an inhaler, and they knew he used an inhaler. So it\u2019s crazy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say. First of all: Din Thomas \u2026 come on, Din. You\u2019ve been in this game forever. His corner, they\u2019ve got to know you can\u2019t use an inhaler in the corner. They should know that. Shouldn\u2019t even be a question. You can drink water. It\u2019s pretty simple. Gatorade in some states.\u201d\n\nHardy reiterated that he did not intend to break rules by using the inhaler mid-fight. He believed at the time that it was legitimate and attempted to clarify that, even though the inhaler gave him no performance advantage.\n\n\u201cYou have complete control of your diaphragm and your lungs (when using the inhaler),\u201d Hardy said. \u201cThey can expand and contract normally. Mine do not. They inflame. It restricts the breathing and airflow. I\u2019m sure a lot of people out here have kids with asthma. You can\u2019t leave them alone, or they\u2019ll die. So it literally just clears the airway so I am able to breath. It\u2019s not so I can breath better. It helps me breath just like you, which evens the playing field.\u201d\n\nHardy ultimately was most frustrated with being caught up in another controversy that took away from his performance, which he believes went well against Sosoli, going three rounds for the first time and taking \u201cthe most and the hardest\u201d shots of his MMA career thus far.\n\nNevertheless, Hardy said he intends to keep moving forward with a positive attitude.\n\n\u201cThe worst part is, here I am letting people down again,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sucky feeling. All I\u2019m trying to do is \u2013 we had a conversation before the fight, I\u2019m doing everything I\u2019m supposed to be doing. I asked permission, they told me I could, and I\u2019m in trouble again. My mind\u2019s on just make sure everyone is happy, making sure everything is cool because it\u2019s a crappy feeling. Everything is about my inhaler instead of me watching a sweet (Chris) Weidman knockout from my boy (Dominick Reyes). Same as any other situation: I\u2019m worried about my team.\n\n\u201cI just fought more time than I\u2019ve ever fought in my whole entire career, and we\u2019re sitting here talking about an inhaler that I\u2019ve used my whole entire life. That\u2019s a crappy feeling, dude. I never want to take away from the UFC brand. I never want to take away from anybody, and I feel like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, and I\u2019m not OK with that.\u201d", "description": "Greg Hardy and the UFC boss both were frustrated after what transpired in Boston.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Dave Doyle"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/greg-hardy-ufc-boston-post-fight.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
