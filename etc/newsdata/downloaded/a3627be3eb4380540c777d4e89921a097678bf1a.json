The axe has been wielded indiscriminately.\n\nIn one area of South Yorkshire, the parliamentary constituency of Wentworth and Dearne, there are now no banks. In contrast, nearby Rotherham has kept nearly all its bank branches. How are they faring? Toby Walne went to find out.\n\nAbandoned town: Wath Upon Dearne\n\nWednesday is market day in Wath upon Dearne. Until a couple of years ago, the market drew in bustling crowds attracted from miles around, coming from Barnsley in the north to Rotherham in the south. Not for nothing did the 19th Century poet James Montgomery describe it as 'the queen of villages' at the heart of South Yorkshire.\n\nMarket day in Wath upon Dearne, where the former Yorkshire Bank is now an empty salon\n\nHow things have changed. Today the market is a shadow of its former self. Indeed, it's a rather depressing affair, especially when the skies are grey and the heavens open in spectacular fashion as they did four days ago when I visited.\n\nApart from a few people aimlessly wandering across the town's square, Wath resembled a ghost town.\n\nThe market's stalwarts \u2013 a grocer, fishmonger and florist \u2013 battled on gamely, but business was at best patchy. Stoic. Heroic.\n\nMaybe, I witnessed Wath at its worst, but there is no escaping the fact that this small town has hit hard times.\n\nBoarded-up shops dominate the high street while the numerous empty market stalls are evidence that the town is slowly dying on its feet.\n\nSadly, there appears little way back. The scars of the past \u2013 the demise of the local coal industry \u2013 and limited employment opportunities mean a revival in the town's fortunes are as likely as Arthur Scargill making a comeback.\n\nThe banks have also played a significant part in the town's atrophy. They have pulled the plug on Wath by closing the town's branches. All of them.\n\nOur Manifesto Every town should have at least one bank.\n\nEvery town should have a free cash machine.\n\nEvery town should have a post office.\n\nFor smaller communities without a bank, post office or free cash machine, \u2018cashback\u2019 must be offered for free at local shops and pubs.\n\nOne regulator must take charge, ensuring there is access to free cash for everyone, and Natalie Ceeney must play a role.\n\nIndeed, between them they have closed every single branch in the parliamentary constituency that Wath resides in \u2013 Wentworth and Dearne, home to 98,000 citizens. The evidence of the banking industry's withdrawal from Wath is everywhere.\n\nThe HSBC, a grand expansive Victorian building that overlooks the market, is boarded up while the old Yorkshire Bank branch is now an empty hairdresser training salon. Both banks pulled out a couple of years ago following the earlier departure of NatWest and TSB.\n\nThe knock-on effect was almost instantaneous. Shops closed as people stopped coming into town while the market's heart was ripped out. Staring down the sorry looking high street now, half of the shops are closed down. Locals, understandably, are unimpressed by the banks' decision to desert Wath.\n\nMilkman Charlie Wright, who still valiantly makes deliveries to a few of the remaining shops, does not mince his words. He says: 'The banks have killed off our community. Few locals do their shopping here because there are no bank branches left where they can get cash.'\n\nSarah Tingle is incensed at the way banks seem to have no sense of responsibility towards their customers. The 38-year-old radiographer says: 'Banks make so much money out of us all \u2013 but for doing what? Turning this place into a ghost town?\n\n'It is such a pain as a bank customer to have to travel to sort out my finances.'\n\nShe adds: 'Now most Wath residents travel ten miles south to Rotherham in order to do their banking. Many of the town's population are elderly, do not have a car, and must take a half-hour bus ride. They are not internet savvy. They have been ostracised.'\n\nLocal Labour MP John Healey is furious at the way his constituents have been treated. He remains angry over how both HSBC and Yorkshire (now part of Virgin) ignored a 1,200-strong petition signed by locals calling for them to keep their branches in the town.\n\nLocal Labour MP John Healey is furious at the way his constituents have been treated\n\nThe Shadow Secretary of State for Housing says he knew the writing was on the wall for the town when banks started talking about 'community engagement' \u2013 doublespeak for shutting their branches.\n\nTaking time out from the bun fight in the House of Commons, he told The Mail on Sunday: 'We were all too aware that closing branches would be devastating for local businesses and the community \u2013 but the banks just did not want to listen.\n\n'They ignored our pleas that people demand a face-to-face service. Up to a third of residents do not want to bother with internet banking. They want to be dealt with by a real person.'\n\nLike most towns where banks shut up shop, Wath has also lost most of its cash machines. Locals must now use a solitary free machine in the local Tesco supermarket or visit the post office situated in a pharmacy where they can withdraw cash.\n\nI leave Wath bedraggled, wet and depressed. Communities like Wath are dying on their feet and no one in banking circles seems to give a jot.\n\nI ring Natalie Ceeney, author of an authoritative report this year into the nation's shrinking access to cash and former boss of the Financial Ombudsman Service. Maybe she can give me some comfort.\n\n'Banks have a social responsibility to look after customers,' she thunders. 'This includes ensuring that everyone in a community \u2013 young, old and the most vulnerable \u2013 has access to cash.'\n\nIn Wath, banks are not fulfilling any social responsibilities.\n\nSurviving the cull: Rotherham\n\nTen miles south of Wath lies Rotherham. Like Wath, its proud days \u2013 as a northern powerhouse on the back of iron and coal \u2013 have long gone. But there is a vibrancy about the town that Wath seems to have lost.\n\nThriving: Rotherham has nine bank branches with only one being axed since 2015\n\nOf course, the colourful bunting that adorns the town centre helps fuel a feelgood factor. As does the impressive New York Stadium, home to the town's battling League One football team. New York? Rotherham? Surely, some mistake.\n\nThe fact that the town is awash with bank branches also helps create an impression that this is a 260,000-strong community going places.\n\nSo far, only one of the town's bank branches has been axed since 2015 \u2013 one run by State-owned Royal Bank of Scotland.\n\nIt leaves Rotherham with nine still standing \u2013 Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Halifax, NatWest, Santander, Nationwide Building Society, Co-op and Yorkshire Bank. No wonder the bunting is out.\n\nSophia Odugleh is a big believer in bank branches. She argues that banks in Rotherham are not just about finance \u2013 they also provide a vital meeting point for a 'close-knit community'.\n\nThe 23-year-old trainee nurse says: 'Maybe hard cash will disappear one day, but for now we must fight tooth-and-nail for its survival and stop banks closing their branches and cash machines to save money. My mother only ever trusts cash and she has passed this wisdom on to me because it helps with my budgeting.'\n\nTrainee nurse Sophia Odugleh with daughter Ayaah says having bank branches helps strengthen its close community\n\nStrolling down the crowded pedestrianised shopping area, I feel comfortable in the knowledge that wherever you turn, a bank is in sight. Behind the grand Rotherham Parish Church in the centre is the All Saints Square toilets. Even spending a penny \u2013 OK, 30p \u2013 is a relief knowing cash is always close at hand.\n\nMusician Tom Jones and coffee bar assistant Jessica Cassidy love the cafe culture that has permeated the town's shopping area. They understand all too well that banks and access to cash are essential for this town to continue thriving.\n\nTom, who is a drummer for band Bodach, says: 'Banks have a deserved reputation for treating customers badly as they are only interested in profits. But they should have a social duty to keep branches open. Closures are bad for communities and local businesses. In the long-term, how can that be good for banks?'\n\nWhile banks often justify branch closures on shrinking usage, some of the banks in Rotherham are positively thriving. Kelvin Webb, a local butcher, says the NatWest branch he uses to bank his takings is busier than ever.\n\nHe says: 'The queues are often snaking out of the door and it can take half an hour to get our business takings sorted out. The branch sometimes struggles to manage.'\n\nMind you, Kelvin is not complaining. His business is doing well, having a bank across the road makes it easy to deposit takings, and many bank customers pop in to his shop afterwards to buy the odd pork chop and black pudding.\n\nAs Kelvin reminds me in style, bank branches really do matter. They make communities tick over very nicely thank you. If only the country's bank executives could look beyond their abacuses, profit margins and obscene bonuses. Bank branches matter.
