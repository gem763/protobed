Steps Down", "language": "en", "text": "The chief executive of Juul Labs, the dominant e-cigarette company that has been the target of public and regulatory outrage over the soaring use of teenage vaping, stepped down on Wednesday.\n\nThe executive, Kevin Burns, will be replaced by K.C. Crosthwaite, an executive from Altria, the major tobacco company that owns a 35 percent stake in Juul, which is based in San Francisco.\n\nJuul also said it would not fight the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to ban most flavored e-cigarettes, which would severely hurt its domestic sales. And the company said it would end one of its campaigns, \u201cMake the Switch,\u201d which the Food and Drug Administration had criticized as an illegal effort to portray its e-cigarettes as safer than traditional cigarettes.\n\nIn addition, Altria and Philip Morris International said on Wednesday that they had ended talks to merge, dashing the chances of reuniting the two arms of what had once been Philip Morris.", "description": "In addition, the tobacco giant Altria, which has a stake in Juul, and Philip Morris International, said they were ending merger talks.", "authors": ["Sheila Kaplan", "Michael J.
