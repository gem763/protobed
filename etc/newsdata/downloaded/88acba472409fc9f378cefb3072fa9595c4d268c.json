While the driver was later convicted of misdemeanor battery, Kim said Lyft declined to say whether he was barred from Lyft's platform and claimed that police told her the driver continued to work for Lyft while the criminal case against him was pending.\n\nMary Winfield, Lyft's head of Trust & Safety, noted in a statement to ABC News when the lawsuits were filed that Lyft is \"committed to providing safe transportation.\"\n\n\u201cWhat the victims describe is terrifying and has no place in the Lyft community,\" she said of the allegations made in the lawsuit. \"One in six women will face some form of sexual violence in their lives \u2014 behavior that\u2019s unacceptable for our society and on our platform.\"\n\nThe company said it would begin offering sexual harassment prevention training available to riders and drivers. Lyft also screens all driver applicants for criminal offenses and does an annual criminal background check, as well as adding recent measures to prevent drivers from providing a fraudulent identity.\n\nThe company also said it bans drivers for harassment and violence.\n\n\"As a platform committed to providing safe transportation, we hold ourselves to a higher standard by designing products and policies to keep out bad actors, make riders and drivers feel safe, and react quickly if and when an incident does occur,\" Winfield said. \"Our commitment is stronger than ever, as we dedicate more resources in our continued effort to ensure our riders and drivers have the safest possible experience.\"\n\nThe company is now expanding its Community Safety Program \"to bring riders and drivers greater protection and peace of mind,\" Lyft President and Co-founder John Zimmer said in a statement.\n\nRichard Vogel/AP, FILE\n\nThe initiatives will include a way to better predict if someone needs help, providing easier access to emergency assistance and requiring sexual violence prevention education to drivers, the statement said.\n\nLater this year, users will start to receive notices checking in on them during and after the ride, asking if they need support or emergency assistance, according to the company. Riders will also be able to access 911 from the app.\n\nIn addition, the company will partner with the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network to ensure it is effective at educating its community \"to protect against bad actors.\" It will also require drivers to complete mandatory community safety education, and anyone reported for violating them will be removed from the platform or required to complete additional courses.\n\n\"Safety is the cornerstone of all healthy communities, and it\u2019s one of the key values Lyft was founded on,\" Zimmer said. \"We don\u2019t take lightly any instances where someone\u2019s safety is compromised, especially in the rideshare industry, including the allegations of assault in the news last week.\"\n\nWe\u2019re committed to your safety. Today, we\u2019re partnering with @RAINN on Community Safety Education \u2014 and sharing additional initiatives toward our goal of making Lyft the safest form of transportation for everyone.
