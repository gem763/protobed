So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don't need to hunt as I did.\u2019 Agemi\n\nIn a letter shared online, the North American customer care team wrote: \u201cWe listened to you and our marketing team worked a solution.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to inform you that as of December we will use a wrapper design without the feminine symbol.\u201d\n\nThe decision has been a controversial one, however, with some users boycotting the brand amidst allegations of \u201cfemale erasure\u201d.\n\n\u201cWomen are quite literally being erased from sanitary products now,\u201d wrote one user.\n\n\u201cIs there anywhere we are allowed to be visible?! @Always\n\n\u201cI have bought your product since the age of 10. Stop erasing the people who use your product from your product. Or you erase my purchase power too.\u201d\n\nThe advocacy organisation Trans Actual saw the move as largely positive, however.\n\n\u201cWell done to @Always for making sure your packaging is inclusive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re quite frankly worried for the women whose sense of self is so fragile that the removal of a symbol from a packet of sanitary towels makes them feel \u2018erased\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Independent, Always said: \u201cFor over 35 years Always has championed girls and women, and we will continue to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also committed to diversity and inclusion, and after hearing from many people across genders and age groups, we realised that not everyone who has a period and needs to use a pad identifies as female.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that anyone who needs to use a period product feels comfortable in doing so with Always, we updated our pad wrapper design.\n\n\u201cOur mission remains to ensure no girl loses confidence at puberty because of her gender or period and we do this through our puberty education programmes, by providing access to period products with programmes such as #EndPeriodPoverty, and by using our brand voice to tackle societal barriers and stigmas like we did with #LikeAGirl.\u201d", "description": "Always sanitary products have announced that they will remove the feminine \u201cVenus\u201d\u00a0symbol on their products in an effort to make them more inclusive to all customers.", "authors": ["Joanna Whitehead"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/21/12/sanitary-towels.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
