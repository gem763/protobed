And soon her name was removed from the runner board.\n\nInitially, Abukaram had been told that she was violating uniform rules because she was wearing long pants. She went ahead and competed in the event, but afterward she found her name was not listed with the other runners.\n\nThe teen said that her teammates told her, \u2018\u201dYou got disqualified,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018For what?\u2019 and they were like, \u2018For wearing your hijab.'\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, like, my heart dropped. I felt like something horrible happened to me, something that I always thought could happen, but never has happened,\u201d Abukaram added. \u201cI think I was mostly embarrassed because like I never expected that to happen.\u201d\n\nOhio High School Athletic Association spokesman Tim Stried told the paper that students who need a religious waiver for clothing and uniforms need to submit their request ahead of time.\n\nStried insisted that the officials who disqualified the girl were \u201csimply enforcing this rule since a waiver had not been submitted.\u201d\n\nNorthview High did file the waiver request after the incident.\n\nHowever, Stried also noted that \u201cOHSAA is also already looking at this specific uniform regulation to potentially modify it in the future so that religious headwear does not require a waiver.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a part of me, I\u2019m not going to take it off so I can run! I just don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else, like any girls younger than me that are wearing hijab,\u201d Abukaram insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to ever have to worry or to have to write a letter so that they can go run.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @WTHuston.", "description": "An Ohio high school cross-country runner was disqualified from a competition because she was wearing a hijab.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/5db1b9de210000b62534af35-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
