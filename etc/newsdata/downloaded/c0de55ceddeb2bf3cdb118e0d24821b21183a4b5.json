He was 90.\n\nThe cause was viral pneumonia, said his literary agency, Aitken Alexander Associates.\n\nMr. Alvarez, who sometimes wrote under the name A. Alvarez, cultivated a reputation as a swashbuckling adrenaline seeker as well as an accomplished poet, novelist and literary critic. Finding writing to be \u201ca solitary, joyless occupation,\u201d he sought escape through mountaineering, boxing, poker and aviation, then drew on his hobbies for articles in the New Yorker and several books of nonfiction.\n\nInitially, he was known for his adventurous taste in poetry and his literary attacks on the \u201cgenteel\u201d style that dominated British poetry in the years after World War II.\n\nIn books, translations and pieces for the Observer \u2014 where he served as poetry editor from 1956 to 1966 \u2014 Mr. Alvarez introduced readers to bold new writers such as the husband-and-wife duo of Plath and Hughes, American poets John Berryman and Robert Lowell, and Eastern European poets Zbigniew Herbert and Miroslav Holub.\n\nHis 1962 Penguin anthology \u201cThe New Poetry\u201d was a landmark work that featured poetry with a \u201cviolent impending presence,\u201d as he put it, shadowed by the Holocaust, the threat of nuclear war and personal trauma. Along with Robert Conquest\u2019s collection \u201cNew Lines\u201d (1956), it became \u201cthe most discussed poetry anthology of the postwar era,\u201d according to literary critic William Wootten\u2019s book \u201cThe Alvarez Generation.\u201d\n\n1 of 58 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2019.

The anthology\u2019s second edition included two more Americans: Anne Sexton and Plath.\n\nBoth died by suicide; Mr. Alvarez had been a friend of Plath before she killed herself in 1963, at 30. Her death led him to reflect on his own suicide attempt, in 1960, when he swallowed 45 sleeping pills as his first marriage unraveled.\n\nMr. Alvarez chronicled that episode in his 1971 book \u201cThe Savage God: A Study of Suicide,\u201d which linked suicide to creativity and included one of the first substantive overviews of Plath\u2019s life. Speculating on the reasons behind her suicide, Mr. Alvarez wrote that it was, in part, \u201ca \u2018cry for help,\u2019 which fatally misfired.\u201d\n\nThe book fueled public interest in Plath\u2019s work, was attacked by Hughes (who rejected Mr. Alvarez\u2019s analysis of his wife\u2019s death) and marked a turn away from literary criticism for Mr. Alvarez. He later explained that he had \u201cbeen down the salt mine of intellectualism, and decided it\u2019s an excuse, really, for not being in touch with living people.\u201d\n\nIn books such as \u201cFeeding the Rat: A Climber\u2019s Life on the Edge\u201d (1988) and \u201cWhere Did It All Go Right?\u201d (1999), Mr. Alvarez recounted his days working on \u201can ancient steam drifter\u201d and a harrowing climbing expedition in which he and a companion found themselves stranded overnight, at risk of freezing to death before daybreak.\n\nFollowing his curiosity to the North Sea, he spent time on oil rigs as large as the Eiffel Tower, buffeted by 100-foot waves and winds gusting 160 knots. Life on the rig, one roughneck told him for the book \u201cOffshore\u201d (1986), was \u201clike going through one of those black holes from one universe to another.\u201d\n\nMr. Alvarez also wrote about divorce (including his own) in the book \u201cLife After Marriage\u201d (1982) and published one of the first major literary works on professional poker, \u201cThe Biggest Game in Town\u201d (1983). The book was widely credited with helping the game grow \u2014 and with spawning a wave of poker literature \u2014 and was hailed by the London Evening Standard as \u201cprobably the best book on poker ever written.\u201d\n\nAdapted from a New Yorker story commissioned by editor William Shawn, it chronicled the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas and introduced players such as Doyle Brunson, Mickey Appleman and Stu \u201cThe Kid\u201d Ungar. \u201cThe chip is like a conjurer\u2019s sleight of hand that turns an egg into a billiard ball, a necessity of life into a plaything, reality into illusion,\u201d Mr. Alvarez wrote.\n\n\u201cIf they had wanted you to hold on to money,\u201d poker player Jack \u201cTreetop\u201d Straus told him, \u201cthey\u2019d have made it with handles on.\u201d\n\nAlfred Alvarez was born in London on Aug. 5, 1929, to a family with Sephardic Jewish roots that led him to never feel \u201caltogether English.\u201d His mother was a homemaker, and Mr. Alvarez described his father as \u201ca terribly bad and thwarted and unhappy business man in the schmutter trade,\u201d or garment business.\n\nA growth on his ankle required major surgery when he was a boy, contributing to an early sense of alienation and a determination to challenge himself outdoors. He studied at a pair of preparatory schools, the Hall in London and Oundle in Northamptonshire, before entering the University of Oxford, where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1952 and a master\u2019s in 1956.\n\nThat same year, amid an infatuation with the work of D.H. Lawrence, he married Ursula Barr, a granddaughter of the writer\u2019s widow, Frieda. They had met just seven weeks earlier, and as their marriage unraveled, he began playing poker, developing a decades-long habit of playing once or twice a week.\n\nIn 1966, he married Anne Adams, a Canadian child psychotherapist. In addition to his wife, survivors include their two children, Luke and Kate Alvarez; and four grandchildren. A son from his first marriage, Adam Alvarez, died in 2016.\n\nMr. Alvarez wrote two thrillers and the novel \u201cHers\u201d (1974), about a woman married to a professor at an \u201cancient and famous\u201d British university, where she has an affair with one of his students. He also wrote several short volumes of poetry, in which he addressed dreams, love and loneliness in an unadorned style.\n\nHis other books included \u201cPoker: Bets, Bluffs and Bad Beats\u201d (2001), the essay collection \u201cRisky Business\u201d (2007) and \u201cPondlife: A Swimmer\u2019s Journal\u201d (2013), about his daily swimming routine in the Hampstead Heath ponds of London, where he was accompanied in the (often bone-chilling) water by cormorants and sea gulls.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t one word of a piece of Al Alvarez\u2019s nonfiction that loses its voice or makes you say, \u2018Wait a minute, Al, move over,\u2019 \u201d New Yorker journalist Jane Kramer wrote in the introduction to \u201cFeeding the Rat.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, there isn\u2019t a word that doesn\u2019t sound like Al talking.\u201d", "description": "He was an early promoter of poet Sylvia Plath and helped professional poker grow.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DVO6fJ7EgtsOwwsa3UD4yQB_P2o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TOCHHJG65YI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
