No, we can\u2019t become so numb to racism and genocide.\u201d\n\nThe Muslim member of Bosnia\u2019s joint presidency Sefik Dzaferovic labelled the decision to award Handke \u201cscandalous and shameful\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful that the Nobel Prize committee easily neglected the fact that Handke was justifying and protecting Slobodan Milosevic and his executors (Bosnian Serb wartime leader) Radovan Karadzic and (his army chief) Ratko Mladic sentenced by a UN court \u2026 for the most severe war crimes including genocide,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nBy awarding Handke the Academy\u2019s Nobel committee has \u201ccompletely lost its moral compass\u201d, Dzaferovic added.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Genocide denier\u2019 \u2013\n\nBosnian actor Nermin Tulic, who was seriously injured during the 1992-1995 siege of Sarajevo by Bosnian Serb forces, greeted the award by tweeting an emoticon of a smiley vomiting.\n\nLiberal Sarajevo politician Reuf Bajrovic said he could not understand that a jury thought that \u201cHandke is a great writer and that his support to Slobo (Milosevic) and genocide makes part of his work great\u201d.\n\nEmir Suljagic, a survivor of the massacre of more than 8,000 Muslim males from Srebrenica by Serbs, echoed him.\n\n\u201cA Milosevic fan and notorious genocide-denier gets Nobel prize in literature \u2026 What a time to be alive,\u201d Suljagic, a Sarajevo-based professor of international relations tweeted in English.\n\nThe 1995 Srebrenica massacre, the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II, was deemed genocide by international justice.\n\n\u2013 Friend of Serbs \u2013\n\nThe reaction was similar in Kosovo, which was devastated by the 1998-1999 war between Serb forces and pro-independence ethnic Albanian guerillas.\n\n\u201cThe decision of Nobel Prize brought immense pain to countless victims,\u201d Kosovo President Hashim Thaci said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cMilosevic\u2019s supporter and denier of Serbian genocide receives the Nobel Literature Prize,\u201d the main Koha Ditore newspaper said.\n\nAt the 2006 funeral of Milosevic \u2014 who died while on trial for crimes against humanity, and who wanted Handke to testify in his defence \u2014 the writer made a speech in front of thousands of mourners.\n\nSome stood up for Handke, including Nobel-winning compatriot Elfriede Jelinek. But many others, from Susan Sontag to Salman Rushdie, lined up to lambast him.\n\nSerbia newspapers hailed that the Nobel Prize was awarded to a \u201cfriend of Serbs\u201d who has been a member of the country\u2019s academy of sciences and arts since 2012.\n\nburs-ng/ljv/pvh", "description": "Belgrade (AFP) \u2013 Austrian writer Peter Handke\u2019s Nobel literature prize win\u00a0on Thursday sparked outrage in Albania, Bosnia and Kosovo, where he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/63038c_austrian-writer-peter-handke-won-2019-nobel-literature-prize-outrage-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
