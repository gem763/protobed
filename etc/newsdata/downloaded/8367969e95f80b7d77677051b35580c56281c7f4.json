Autonomous vehicles could potentially carry out a range of tasks including logistics support and intelligence gathering, the firm added. Broadly, the Australian Army's RAS Strategy focuses on how it can leverage emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems.\n\n\n\n\"Autonomous technology will assist soldiers to respond in an accelerating warfare environment \u2014 increasing their speed of initiative to outpace, out-maneuver and out-think conventional and unconventional threats,\" Brad Yelland, the chief technology officer of BAE Systems Australia, said in a statement.\n\nConnected and intelligent technologies are starting to impact a number of military organizations. In February 2019, for example, the British Army awarded a \u00a31 million ($1.22 million) contract to a software developer to \"explore how virtual reality can be integrated into soldier training.\"\n\n\n\nAt the time, the British Army said the pilot scheme would look to test a range of virtual reality applications. These include high resolution virtual reality headsets; avatars that can be customized to replicate facial features and body shapes; and technology that offers data capture and analysis to help soldiers \"better understand their own performance.\"", "description": "Autonomous vehicles could undertake a number of important tasks.", "authors": ["Anmar Frangoul"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106111260-1567605187093gettyimages-471630396.jpeg?v=1567605208"}
