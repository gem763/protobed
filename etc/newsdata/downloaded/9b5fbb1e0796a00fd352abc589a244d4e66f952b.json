It could always be fixed through a touch of Photoshop, or a pliant attorney general. It was never about implacable facts that might hunt you down.\n\nAccordingly, Trump chose to play Chicago politics with Ukraine, as if a sovereign nation at war on its eastern border with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia was there mainly to be squeezed for his re-election campaign. He has trashed the press, judges, the Federal Reserve, members of Congress \u2014 anyone or anything that stood up to him. He has set up operations at the White House as a shambolic exercise in terror. His cabinet fawns, as Saddam Hussein\u2019s once did, scrambling to find loftier expressions of adulation that might delay execution.\n\nJust ask the White House operatives who wanted the American warship John S. McCain moved \u201cout of sight\u201d during Trump\u2019s trip to Japan this year, or the National Weather Service hounded for dismissing Trump\u2019s weird obsession that a nonexistent hurricane threat to Alabama existed. Never before in history have meteorologist come so close to being a bellwether of creeping autocracy.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the impeachment inquiry serves what must be the fundamental goal of Democrats: to remove Donald Trump from office as soon as possible. It will increase the political volume; Trump thrives on volume. It will further polarize the United States; Trump thrives on division, not unity. It has little chance of leading to his removal because, even if the House charges Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors, the Republican-controlled Senate is highly unlikely to vote to convict him. It may make life more difficult for swing-state Democratic representatives.\n\nAll of this worries me, but in the end I don\u2019t care. The balance has been tipped. Nobody can accuse Pelosi of rashness. She has been deliberate. She said, \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d That principle must be cardinal.\n\nTrump\u2019s assault on truth, the press, institutions, civility, and the law has been relentless. His unfitness for office has been so glaring as to be breathtaking. As Stephen Burbank, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, wrote , \u201cThere comes a time when strategic political calculations must yield to principle if pragmatism is not to entail complicity.\u201d He continued, \u201cThe impeachment process is integral to the architecture our founders created for the preservation of democracy.\u201d For Congress to ignore what Trump has done would be to set a dangerous example for future generations.\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic, we have witnessed two men making audacious claims to power and suffering resounding rebukes from two separate but equal branches of government that made clear the executive is not above the law \u2014 in Britain from its highest court applying an unwritten constitution, in the United States from Congress exercising its constitutional prerogatives. An important lesson is this: It takes independent institutions to make the law meaningful and hold the executive to account. That is why dictatorships, or illiberal systems like Hungary\u2019s, seek to suppress them.\n\nJohnson is now in a very tight corner. His acts have been found to be unlawful; he should resign. He won\u2019t. But if the gods of retribution have really awoken, he will be gone soon and Britain will yet avoid the national disaster, advanced by his lies, of exit from the European Union.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
