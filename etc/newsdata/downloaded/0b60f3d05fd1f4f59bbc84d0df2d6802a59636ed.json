It\u2019s like my penalty-taking record,\u201d grinned Dyche, too often damned with faint praise about Burnley\u2019s directness when they have churned out England \u00adinternationals on his watch.\n\nAnd one of these days, when \u2018big\u2019 clubs discover boutique vogue is no \u00adsubstitute for efficiency, he might even land one of the plum jobs \u2013 although he is not holding his breath.\n\n\u201cGood people get the good jobs, and that\u2019s the way it is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI certainly enthuse about British managers doing well and, if there\u2019s enough of us doing a good job, at some point maybe owners will think, \u2018Are we missing a trick here?\u2019 \u00adHopefully, that will open more doorways, and open-mindedness, towards English or British coaches.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about me, or whether I get a chance at one of the perceived big clubs, but a \u00adcollective thing about home-grown managers and what we have to offer.\u201d\n\nWhen Dyche took over in 2012, Sir Alex Ferguson was still at large and Arsene Wenger had three more trophies to win before his sunset at \u00ad Arsenal .\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\nApart from longevity \u00aditself, Dyche believes his greatest achievement, since replacing Eddie Howe, has been a \u00adharmonious unity of purpose on and off the pitch.\n\n\u201cWe have managed to turn a club that was perhaps \u00adquestioning where it belonged, into the whole town \u2013 more or less \u2013 totally buying into what we are doing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the world where we live now, that \u00adconnectivity between a club and its fan base is more relevant than ever. We know that winning advances that connection, and so far we have won more than we\u2019ve lost.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really want me here at the start. I think Mick \u00adMcCarthy and Ian Holloway were the favourites, and I was just \u00adanother name in the frame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take on a job when you have to win over a lot of people\u2019s hearts and minds. For six months, our results were up and down... I learned a lot about myself and the task I had taken on.\n\n(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe second difficult period was relegation. The reason I \u00adsurvived was a real, solid truth about the way we spoke in the boardroom. Even though we went down, there was no debt, no losses, and at least we had \u00adupgraded the fabric of the club for a year in the Premier League.\n\n\u201cAnd last season, we only had 12 points from 19 games, which is enough to get you out at a lot of clubs, but the fans understood the reasons and stayed with us. That was class.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the \u2018sliding doors\u2019 \u00admoment in Dyche\u2019s managerial career had come just 13 games into his first job at Watford .\n\nWith a patchwork squad and a chump of an owner \u2013 Laurence Bassini, the discharged bankrupt, who tried to buy Bolton earlier this year \u2013 eight defeats and only two wins in his first 14 games had left him with no margin for error.\n\nHe was given a rough ride at a fans\u2019 forum, and his baptism in the dugout could have been shortlived, until acting chairman Graham Taylor and godfather of Vicarage Road, stood up for him.\n\n(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\n\u201cI was getting absolutely \u00admullered,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cGraham, bless his soul, said, \u2018Hang on a minute \u2013 this fella is answering every one of your questions with candour and honesty, so let\u2019s show him some courtesy\u2019.\n\n\u201cGraham was a powerful \u00adinfluence at Watford, rightly so, and you could feel the shift in \u00adattitude. I\u2019ll never forget that.\n\n\u201cAnd Steve Bruce saved my \u00adcareer by selling us Nyron \u00adNosworthy from Sunderland for a pitiful amount. Without those two twists of fate, who knows where I could have ended up? Maybe \u00adanother first-time manager who had a go but didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nDyche, 48, has learned to surf the barbs about Burnley\u2019s style and added: \u201cThe longer you are in the game, the more it washes over you. I could rebrand this team \u00adimmediately, and start rolling it along the six-yard line, but I don\u2019t think it would work.\n\n\u201cBut, whatever your style, \u00adwinning will never go out of \u00adfashion.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Burnley boss Dyche believes that the only way British managers will be considered by the top clubs is if more have success", "authors": ["Mike Walters", "Image", "Andy Commins", "Daily Mirror", "Pa", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20725451.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Burnley-FCs-manager-Sean-Dyche.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
