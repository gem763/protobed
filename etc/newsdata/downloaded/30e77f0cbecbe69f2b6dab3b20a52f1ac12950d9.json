REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado/File Photo\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Is it better to criticise from inside the tent, to paraphrase U.S. President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s famously earthy line, or from outside? Aberdeen Standard and other shareholders want miner BHP to cut ties with industry groups at odds with Paris climate pledges. The $113 billion Anglo-Australian giant says it is already reviewing its memberships, but argues change can be promoted from within too. It\u2019s a quandary familiar to fossil fuel investors.\n\nAt annual meetings over the coming weeks, shareholders will grill boss Andrew Mackenzie\u2019s outfit over the company it keeps. That makes sense: the impact of negative lobbying is significant, and detrimental. It encourages companies to focus on the short-term - resisting carbon pricing, for example - rather than preparing for inevitable change.\n\nIt also makes for uncomfortable contradictions if companies like BHP talk up green goals, while paying others to undermine them. Such duplicity can be symptomatic of other governance troubles, and there\u2019s reputational risk too, so shareholders are right to be concerned.\n\nBreak-ups are underway. Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell have already announced high-profile exits. BHP left the World Coal Association after its last membership review in 2017.\n\nBut this hasn\u2019t altered the balance of power much yet. The U.N.-backed Principles for Responsible Investment said last year that of the 50 most powerful trade groups, organisations opposing climate policy outnumbered those supporting it by seven to one.\n\nThe question then becomes whether it is better to be inside pushing for change, or to cut ties altogether. Green-minded investors face a similar conundrum: can they exert more pressure by holding shares, or divesting?\n\nThe answer depends on influence, and BHP is the biggest kid on the block. Take the Minerals Council of Australia. In 2016, BHP paid MCA A$1.9 million ($1.29 million), 17% of its subscription revenue. And yet MCA is only beginning to draw up a climate action plan.\n\nBHP pushes back against shareholder criticism by pointing to its periodic membership review; that\u2019s insufficient. Excluding obviously problematic partners like Coal21 is not enough either. But Mackenzie has a plausible argument that he can make a difference from the inside. The miner can assuage investors by not only laying out organisations\u2019 positions and points of disagreement, but also setting clear goals for them, as it does for itself. That would leave less room for hypocrisy.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Is it better to criticise from inside the tent, to paraphrase U.S. President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s famously earthy line, or from outside?
