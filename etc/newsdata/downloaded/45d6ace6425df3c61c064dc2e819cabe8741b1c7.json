Hahn had been considered alongside acting FDA chief Norman \u201cNed\u201d Sharpless and Harvard professor Alexa Boer Kimball.\n\nThe White House and HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and the sources with knowledge of the process cautioned that Trump could still change his mind.\n\nBut Hahn is considered the consensus choice within both HHS and the White House, those sources said. He is also the only one of the finalists to meet with Trump, according to one person with knowledge of the process.\n\nMorning eHealth A daily report on the intersection of health care and technology \u2014 in your inbox.

Administration officials view such leadership experience as crucial to running a sprawling agency responsible for a wide array of initiatives in food and drug safety, tobacco regulation and other areas.\n\nHahn is also a longtime GOP donor, according to Federal Election Commission records, having contributed to Republican presidential campaigns dating at least as far back to George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 presidential run.\n\nAnd unlike some past FDA commissioners, he has accepted relatively little money from the drug and medical device industries. According to CMS\u2019 Open Payments database, which tracks industry contributions to doctors, Hahn received roughly $1,000 in travel and lodging fees from radiation oncology device company Varian Medical Systems in 2017.\n\nThose qualities helped boost Hahn\u2019s candidacy, sources said, as administration officials sought a pick who could quickly clear the Senate confirmation process.\n\nThough Sharpless \u2014 who previously headed the National Cancer Institute \u2014 is well-liked within the FDA and had won praise from former Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, several other former FDA chiefs and health groups, administration officials raised concerns about how he would fare under Senate scrutiny.\n\nSharpless had previously donated to several Democratic campaigns, including both of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential runs and to the opponents of current North Carolina GOP Sens. Thom Tillis and Richard Burr.\n\nBurr sits on the Senate HELP Committee responsible for considering FDA nominees.\n\nIt also remained unclear how Sharpless would approach tobacco regulation \u2014 a hotly contested area that had previously pitted Burr and some other Republicans against Gottlieb\u2019s efforts to crack down on menthol and flavored tobacco products.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, have criticized the FDA under Sharpless over its approach to e-cigarette regulation \u2014 scrutiny that\u2019s intensified in recent weeks amid the spread of a mystery vaping illness that\u2019s largely affected teens.\n\nThis article tagged under: FDA", "description": "Stephen Hahn is in line to be nominated to head the agency within the next several weeks, pending completion of a background check.", "authors": ["Adam Cancryn", "Sarah Karlin-Smith"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d3/24/d8aadbf843c5ab97abd8b8c38898/19114-fda-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
