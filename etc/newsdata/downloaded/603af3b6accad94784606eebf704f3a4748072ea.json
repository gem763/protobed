He\u2019s rude. He\u2019s in your face. And he doesn\u2019t give a damn about how the Left\u2019s political correctness protocols that are killing comedy. Kids cannot take a joke. And the comedian\u2019s take on those of the alternative lifestyle, specifically transgender folks, has stoked the ire of the progressive Left. In other words, do all you can to support Dave Chappelle\u2014who takes free speech seriously in his acts. He attacks everyone. That\u2019s fair. And those attacks are usually hysterical.\n\nHis latest comedy special on Netflix, Sticks and Stones, triggered the critics and liberal America. Everyone else loved it. Alas, we see the disconnect between normal people and the legions of the overly educated, humorless zombies that seek to ruin everything. Ever since Trump won the 2016 election, the critics have taken to hear the resistance, social justice warrior angle that has led them to write trash reviews. I didn\u2019t think the remake of Death Wish, starring Bruce Willis, was necessary but it was a good movie. Chappelle is the latest target of this political correctness cancer, but he shouldn\u2019t despair. The comedian recently won the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, an immense honor. In his remarks, he delivered a defense of the Second Amendment (via Washington Times):\n\nComedian Dave Chappelle gave a compelling defense of the Second Amendment in front of a star-studded Washington crowd on Sunday. The Emmy-winning comedian accepted the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at The Kennedy Center, where he reportedly delivered impromptu remarks defending free speech and comedians he knows who are \u201cvery racist.\u201d \u201c[I] don\u2019t get mad at \u2018em, don\u2019t hate on \u2018em,\u201d he said, USA Today reported. \u201cMan, it\u2019s not that serious. The First Amendment is first for a reason. Second Amendment is just in case the First one doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d Mr. Chappelle argued that only the U.S. \u201ccould produce this many comedians\u201d but that comedy is needed now more than ever in such a tense political climate.\n\nAnd the irony is that Chappelle actually has a disdain for firearms, but he\u2019s not an idiot. He made his views on guns very clear in Sticks and Stones, where he states that he can\u2019t stand firearms, but that he owns several. And yes, we could use more comedy that isn\u2019t subjected to left-wing ad hoc councils on appropriate speech that pop up everywhere nowadays.", "description": ".10/29/2019 19:59:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/239/45c4ce72-bd72-4314-9837-6ac7e646c195.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
