Analyzing responses from 114 participants in four age groups spanning from 8 to 69, K\u00f6ber and Tilmann found that the older they get, the more likely people are to perceive their parents as \u201cindividuals beyond their nurturing role.\u201d People\u2019s \u201cunderstanding of parents\u201d\u2014the notion of them as real people\u2014was found to be low during one\u2019s late teens and 20s, after which it increases through late adulthood. Negative evaluations of one\u2019s parents are especially common during adolescence. \u201cThis is partly because adolescents strive for emancipation from parents in order to establish social autonomy and their own personal identity,\u201d K\u00f6ber and Tilmann wrote.\n\nDuring and right after the traditional college years, that adversarial posture starts to recede as students begin to \u201cperceive their parents as complex individuals with weaknesses,\u201d the scholars suggested. At the same time, as the authors of a separate longitudinal study note, parents may decide to \u201crelinquish some degree of control over their offspring\u2019s behaviors.\u201d Because much of the tension that besets a teenager\u2019s relationship with her parents stems from her sense of repressed autonomy, the newfound independence may help remedy that tension.\n\nOf course, many young adults can\u2019t or don\u2019t attend college: As of April 2019, roughly three in 10 high-school graduates ages 16 to 24 weren\u2019t pursuing a postsecondary education, according to federal data. These emerging adults will likely experience their own transition in their relationship to their parents\u2014perhaps abruptly if they move away from home and become financially independent, perhaps in a gradual way similar to college students if they continue living with their parents but earn their own money.\n\nMany of today\u2019s emerging adults who do pursue college, meanwhile, are attaining independence from their parents more slowly than their predecessors did. Over the past decade or so, parents have assumed a more hands-on role in their kids\u2019 college experiences\u2014a trend that\u2019s helped to popularize the helicopter-parent stereotype and may elongate students\u2019 pathway to full-fledged autonomy. Instead of students announcing, \u2018I got into college!,\u2019 the parents are announcing, \u2018We got into college!\u2019\u201d says Duncan, who\u2019s worked at Meredith, a women\u2019s college, for a little more than a decade as a professor and adviser.\n\nBy playing a more active role in their kids\u2019 college life, parents may be changing the progression of that relationship, and delaying the distance that can breed understanding. In his forthcoming book, Failure to Launch: Why Your Twentysomething Hasn\u2019t Grown Up \u2026 And What to Do About It, the clinical psychologist Mark McConville, who specializes in emerging adults, cautions parents against instilling in their kids the assumption that they\u2019ll always be around to solve problems. This attitude can prompt a child to always take for granted her parents financial and material support, McConville argues\u2014a tendency he suggests is the common denominator across all the \u201cstruggling transitioners\u201d he\u2019s worked with and writes about.", "description": "The distance can actually strengthen the bond.", "authors": ["Alia Wong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_100816136541/facebook.jpg?1569258536", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
