While Garland\u2019s insomnia was thought to have been caused by the prescription pills she was addicted to, Zellweger was kept awake by her research, captivated by the person she was about to portray. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to come to know a person whom you\u2019ve never met, there are tiny little things that you\u2019re mining for,\u201d she says. \u201cI just kept wanting to find the next.\u201d\n\nIn her performance, Zellweger alternates between the warmth and laugh-out-loud wit that made Garland such a magnetic star, and the sadness and loneliness the singer experienced and sometimes succumbed to which, along with the pills, rendered her unable to perform at all. Acting aside, there were also a lot of songs that needed to be sung. The action of Judy centers around the late 1968\u2013early 1969 run of sold-out shows Garland did in London at the Talk of the Town nightclub during some of the final months of her life, in order to earn enough money to provide her two youngest children with a stable home. Zellweger says she couldn\u2019t sing the songs at the beginning, but she learned to. In the movie, she sang and performed the choreography for all of Garland\u2019s hit songs herself.\n\nAt the Toronto International Film Festival last week, Zellweger reportedly received a three-minute standing ovation that brought her to tears. Here, she tells WSJ. about the mood on set, working with director Rupert Goold and how she prepared to sing the \u201cbelters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I read the script, I was intrigued about why David Livingstone, the producer, and Rupert Goold, the director, wanted to make the film. I was curious about what they were hoping to achieve and why they sent it to me. That was it initially. I was curious.\n\n\u201cThey were hoping to bring context to the circumstances surrounding [Judy Garland\u2019s] life in her final months. While her life ended prematurely, and there was clearly difficulty in it, she was a joyful person and ever hopeful. She continued, despite the challenges, to achieve extraordinary things. She continued to deliver to the audiences who had come to expect so much from her through the decades.\n\n\u201cThank goodness there was a vast collection of archival footage on the internet from her television shows [and] her interviews. I read all the biographies I could find. That\u2019s where I began. I got more and more greedy as we went along. One thing made me curious about another thing, and one performance made me want to see another performance, and there was very little sleeping. I wanted to know how she walked. I wanted to see what her laugh sounds like on television versus in private moments. I could find that and then there would be the next thing: How does she carry herself when she\u2019s nervous? How does she carry herself when she\u2019s comfortable? When she\u2019s with her children?\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sing [her] songs when we started. I\u2019ve never really tried to sing belters before, so it was a process, working towards being able to manipulate my voice that way. I methodically tried to break it down and look at it from a stylistic perspective: \u2018Oh, this is the recognizable sort of quality of Judy\u2019s performance, and she bows this way and holds her face this way.\u2019 Like that. I tried to intellectualize it a little bit because it seems much less daunting. And then there were certain things I couldn\u2019t figure out [at first]. I couldn\u2019t figure out the differences in her facial expressions that would change in her cheeks and her eyebrows.\n\nZellweger on the set with director Rupert Goold. \u201cCreatively, I couldn\u2019t be more spoiled in terms of exploring a project,\u201d she says.

[Director Rupert Goold] is such a deeply thoughtful person. I\u2019ve known him for such a long time now. He had a really interesting process in finding the best of the material and the subtext in the narrative. It was as if he wants emotion not to be cerebral but physically felt. So when we were, for example, working on \u2018By Myself,\u2019 which is the first song in the film\u2026there\u2019s a lot of fear and anger and self-realization in the words of that song, also this determination to triumph. So in the rehearsal space, he would have me leaning into this baby grand and trying to push it across the room as I\u2019m singing the song. Because he wanted it to come from my entire body, this performance.\n\n\u201cAnother time, in a rehearsal space on the soundstages, he scattered these chairs all around and I had to stay there. They were metal and plastic chairs\u2014important to note that. Not priceless, hand-carved antiques. He would have me kick them or throw them on the moment of emphasis, where he [wanted me to] \u2018show the truth\u2019 of what she\u2019s feeling so that [it] would translate into the choreography later on. Creatively, I couldn\u2019t be more spoiled in terms of exploring a project.\n\n\u201cOn set, I like to figure out where it is we\u2019re trying to go on that day and stay [in character] there rather than start over all the time. It wasn\u2019t a Method thing or anything like that. [I\u2019d] go home and FaceTime the vocal coach to discuss tomorrow\u2019s work and where we intended to go tomorrow with the dialect.\n\n\u201cFrom what I gather, and plus you can only speculate, I felt hope [was driving Garland at that time]. I felt loneliness and longing, but also joy in moments and tenacity. Determination, maybe, but always hope and love. Love for work and love for children, love for the many possibilities. I think it\u2019s one thing to be a persona with this unparalleled God-given talent, and it\u2019s quite another thing to overcome what seems to be insurmountable difficulty in order to continue to perform. And I think in that context, Judy was heroic. She continued to inspire and share so much with the audiences who adored her, and I think that really sets her apart. I think that was the hope [of the movie], to celebrate her and the legacy of extraordinary work that she\u2019s left for generations.\u201d\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "description": "Preparing to play the iconic performer involved throwing chairs, FaceTiming nightly with her vocal coach and staying in character on set.", "authors": ["Lane Florsheim", "Lane.Florsheim Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108512/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
