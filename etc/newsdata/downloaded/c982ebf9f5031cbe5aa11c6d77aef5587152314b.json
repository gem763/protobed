The prohibition applies to all commercial flights from and within the country, regardless of whether the device is in cabin baggage or hold luggage.\n\nYet Mr Elliott successfully made two domestic flights on Vietnam Airlines wile carrying the computer.\n\nBefore the first flight, from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi, he says: \u201cAt security they asked to look at the serial number of my laptop. They checked extensively and told me that it was fine.\u201d\n\nThe same happened on the second flight, from the Vietnamese capital to Da Nang.\n\nBut when he began his journey back to Europe, he says, the laptop was suddenly suspect.\n\n\u201cAt first they said \u2018don\u2019t switch it on during the flight\u2019. But then security decided to say a flat \u2018no\u2019 to me taking it on the aircraft.\u201d\n\nA manager suggested that he left the laptop behind in Vietnam with a friend. \u201cIt is not going to happen as I absolutely need my laptop to work, book accommodation, etc,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWith my flight departed Vietnam Airlines refused to find me any accommodation. I had to rely on the Vietnamese travel company who invited me here to find me somewhere to stay, which thankfully they did.\u201d\n\nMr Elliott said: \u201cYou have to wonder that if an airline deems this so important that it should be communicated to all passengers who have tickets for travel. But at no stage was this done before my journey and twice during my journey my laptop was deemed safe to fly.\u201d\n\nNeither he nor The Independent has been able to identify any warnings on the Vietnam Airlines website about the suspect MacBook.\n\nHe is now waiting for the battery to be replaced, which could take up to two weeks. The replacement part must be flown in from Singapore.\n\nThe photographer took advantage of the visa-on-arrival option for Vietnam, but with the permit about to expire he had to spend an additional US$65 (\u00a352) to extend his stay.\n\nMr Elliott was due to fly to Romania on Monday 30 September for another job, but has had to postpone the visit.\n\n\u201cThere could be worse places to be stuck but right now I have no idea if my travel insurance will cover this sort of thing.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has asked Vietnam Airlines for a response.\n\nLithium-ion batteries have been implicated in a number of fires on board aircraft, and bans were imposed for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.", "description": "A British travel photographer is \u201ctrapped\u201d in Vietnam because the national airline will not allow him to fly with his Apple MacBook Pro.
