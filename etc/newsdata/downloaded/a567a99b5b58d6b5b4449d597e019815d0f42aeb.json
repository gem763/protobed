That\u2019s prompting authorities to push for consolidation. Desperate to avoid that fate, the banks are shedding their traditional conservatism, fueling questions about their ability to manage riskier holdings including foreign assets.\n\nThe latest case came last week. Local lenders were among the buyers of Samurai bonds sold by Export-Import Bank of India with a BBB+ rating, just three steps away from junk, that may have dissuaded the financial firms in the past. In another unconventional move last month, a few regional banks also put their money in the first negative-yielding note issued by a Japanese agency.\n\nProfits at regional banks have fallen as they compete for a shrinking pool of borrowers in smaller cities and rural areas where depopulation has led to shuttered shops and abandoned houses. Rock-bottom interest rates are also weighing on their margins. They\u2019re taking bigger risks to compensate, such as lending to the real estate sector, buying overseas debt and investing in structured finance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s excessive competition among regional banks now, which is driving fierce competition to get profit margins,\u201d said Takayuki Atake, head of credit research at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. \u201cThey used to only buy domestic bond products but they have no choice but to take risks by looking into overseas debt.\u201d\n\nAuthorities are scrutinizing the riskier behavior, which Moody\u2019s Investors Service says could make their earnings more volatile and increase the cost for them to comply with financial regulations.\n\nEven Japan\u2019s two major rating firms, which have tended to take a more lenient view, are sounding alarms. Downgrades and outlook cuts of regional lenders have increased to 13 so far this year at Japan Credit Rating Agency and Rating & Investment Information, the most for similar periods in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2010.\n\nGlobal fund managers are looking at such cases in Japan, whose central bank was the first to adopt zero interest rates two decades ago, as harbingers of what might be coming elsewhere. Now plunging rates are a global phenomenon, with more than $17 trillion of investment-grade debt worldwide, or about 30% of the total, having negative yields.\n\nThe subzero rates mean that Europe\u2019s banks may soon need to either change their business model or shrink, the head of Denmark\u2019s financial watchdog said last month. Executives at European lenders are also saying they can\u2019t rule out charging retail clients for deposits, something that would break a taboo in the banking world.\n\nThe signs from Japan aren\u2019t encouraging. Net income of 64 first-tier regional banks fell 21% to a seven-year low of 622.3 billion yen ($5.9 billion) in the year ended March 31, according to Regional Banks Association of Japan data. Profits fell as the cost to deal with non-performing loans increased, it said.\n\nMoody\u2019s cited \u201cthe inability of Japanese banks to maintain profits without taking on more risk\u201d last month when it put some of the regional lenders on review for downgrade.\n\nJapan\u2019s shrinking population is also a pressing concern. It\u2019s set to slump by almost a third by 2060, by which time about 40% will be 65 or over, according to the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.\n\nPolicy makers are taking steps to deal with the increased competition among banks amid those demographic changes.\n\nThe Financial Services Agency last month announced steps to monitor regional lenders to ensure their operations are sustainable, including pushing poorly performing banks to change their business models. The government also said earlier this year that legislation will be submitted to parliament in 2020 that will exempt regional banks from anti-monopoly law for 10 years to facilitate mergers.\n\nThose are positive steps for the sector, whose lending to riskier borrowers hasn\u2019t led to a rise in earnings reflective of the higher risks, Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a report. \u201cConsolidation is the only feasible long-term solution to Japanese regional banking\u2019s ills.\u201d\n\n(Updates with tout on negative-yielding agency bond)", "description": "Japan\u2019s Small Banks Load Up on Risk as They Fight to Survive", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic40e974747ac82b89f843e01a3a9c7161.jpg"}
