What I'm about to say is something so racist I never thought my soul could ever feel it. But truly I never wanna spend time with white people again (if that's what non-muslims are called). Not for one moment, for any reason. They are disgusting. \u2014 Sinead O'Connor (AKA Shuhada Sadaqat) (@MagdaDavitt77) November 6, 2018\n\nThe \u201cNothing Compares 2 U\u201d singer \u2014 who famously tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II during a controversial 1992 Saturday Night Live performance in protest against the sexual abuse of children in the Catholic church \u2014 was called an \u201cembarrassment to Ireland\u201d over her November rant, with many commenters telling her to \u201cget some help.\u201d\n\nVideo: Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor Says She\u2019s Done With White People\n\nO\u2019Connor is now backtracking on her inflammatory remarks on the heels of an appearance on Ireland\u2019s Late Late Show on Friday. The 52-year-old wore a red robe and hijab for the show, where she performed her most famous single and discussed her Islamic faith.\n\n\u201cI had so much prejudice about Islam,\u201d she shared, but said that reading the Quran made her \u201crealize I'm home, and that I've been a Muslim all my life. There's a way of thinking.\u201d\n\nFollowing her appearance on the show, O\u2019Connor issued a formal apology for her past comments, telling followers that she was \u201cangry and unwell\u201d as well as \u201ctriggered as a result of Islamophobia\u201d at the time. She apologized for \u201churt caused.\u201d\n\nAs regards to remarks I made while angry and unwell, about white people... they were not true at the time and they are not true now. I was triggered as a result of islamophobia dumped on me. I apologize for hurt caused. That was one of many crazy tweets lord knows \u2014 Sinead O'Connor (AKA Shuhada Sadaqat) (@MagdaDavitt77) September 8, 2019\n\nHer mea culpa received a mostly warm reception from fans, while her Late Late Show performance is earning rave reviews.\n\nGood to see you back on track. We all struggle! Keep on singing x \u2014 Alice Manning (@alida1962) September 8, 2019\n\nFair play for explaining and owning your remarks. No doubt it won't be good enough for the poisonous few but please don't give them any power to drag you down. \u2014 Anna St. George (@Annacreegan) September 8, 2019\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
