The spicy chicken still spicy. It\u2019s just how you order from the 50-year-old Wendy\u2019s is about to look a little different, if you want it to be.\n\nAt long last, Wendy\u2019s (WEN) is getting serious about delivery, to cater to the growing on-demand consumer ordering environment. Wendy\u2019s is looking at bringing in Uber Eats and GrubHub as delivery partners before yearend, CEO Todd Penegor tells Yahoo Finance. Spokespeople for GrubHub and Uber Eats didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.\n\nWendy\u2019s currently has an exclusive arrangement with delivery service DoorDash. But now that its technology systems have been updated, Penegor says Wendy\u2019s is ready to welcome more delivery partners to its platform to fatten up sales and profits.\n\n\u201cWe are now open for business on technology\u201d Penegor says.

Restaurant Brands\u2019 (QSR) said Tuesday its Burger King chain will soon begin delivery through Uber Eats. A spokesperson for Burger King tells Yahoo Finance GrubHub will remain a delivery partner under a pre-existing agreement.\n\nBack in July, McDonald\u2019s (MCD) dropped Uber Eats as its exclusive delivery partner and also added DoorDash.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
