But on no single issue has she faced a more persistent drumbeat from assorted members of her caucus than the impeachment of the president, whom her entire party regards as a criminal but whom far fewer have believed it wise, politically, to prosecute. Suddenly, though, almost her entire caucus is behind her, and Pelosi\u2019s months of caution (years, really, since Maxine Waters and Al Green first started calling for impeachment) look something like strategic prescience. It\u2019s true that the Ukraine story was impossible to predict, and the polling swing in favor of impeachment has happened faster than even its loudest boosters could have hoped. But having held its fire on matters of Trump\u2019s emoluments, his tax records, his alleged collusion, and his obstruction of justice, the Democratic House appears to be in a nearly unified position, poised to bring charges on an egregious, easy-to-follow transgression committed in plain sight \u2014 which even her lefty critics have to admit is not the worst place to be.\n\nWhen Pelosi convened the 235 House Democrats behind closed doors on a Tuesday afternoon late last month to announce that she would back an impeachment inquiry into Trump \u2014 now that there was clear evidence he had pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to effectively support his 2020 campaign \u2014 she was careful to remind them she\u2019d had a plan from the start. \u201cWe had ourselves on a path, seeking the truth there, and that work must still go on,\u201d she said to her colleagues in the Capitol, referring to investigations into the administration they\u2019d pursued since regaining control from Republicans in January. \u201cWhat has happened this past week is grievous and serious with our Constitution. And so we must. It is understandable to the public. It has clarity in terms of what he did,\u201d she continued, according to a senior Democratic aide in the room. \u201cWe have to strike while the iron is hot. This is a national-security issue \u2014 a national-security issue \u2014 and we cannot let him think that this is a casual thing. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m at.\u201d\n\nIt was a monumental, if reluctant, step for the 79-year-old San Franciscan, who is simultaneously a liberal icon and the face of the party Establishment, who watched Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment from the House, then shut down calls to impeach George W. Bush during her first stint as Speaker eight years later. The 17-term congresswoman, who has been known to quote Abraham Lincoln\u2019s line \u201cPublic sentiment is everything,\u201d had long bet there was no way to successfully impeach Trump earlier in his presidency \u2014 frustrating the 138 members of her caucus who were already calling for it before the Ukraine news broke. As recently as early last month, she had privately dressed down the staffers who were leading what she saw as the overly aggressive, undisciplined, and premature impeachment push, sniping, \u201cYou can feel free to leak this,\u201d according to Politico.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted that she\u2019s come around and is moving forward,\u201d said Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton, who led the most recent failed campaign to oust Pelosi, and who\u2019s been pushing for months for impeachment on national-security grounds.\n\nAnother way of looking at it \u2014 the way Pelosi sees it \u2014 is that circumstances demanded action. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, the Democrats changed their minds.\u2019 We didn\u2019t change our minds,\u201d Pelosi told her colleagues on a private conference call late last month, according to an aide on the call. \u201cI think impeaching the president is very divisive unless we have to. And I said we would wait until we had the facts, and we have the facts. And I said when we have the facts, we will be ready. And we are.\u201d\n\nPelosi is now in charge. None of her allies has set up external war rooms or rapid-response operations. Not even Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez, theoretically the head of the party, found out about Pelosi\u2019s decision to move forward with the inquiry until it became public, said Democrats familiar with the time line.\n\nNowhere was Pelosi\u2019s control of the moment and understanding of her caucus clearer than when she chose to empower Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, whom many Democratic members trust as a reliable messenger, to spearhead a process assumed to belong primarily to Jerry Nadler\u2019s Judiciary Committee. For months, moderate members of the caucus chafed while outspoken pro-impeachment members of the Judiciary panel drove the messaging on TV. When former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski appeared before the Judiciary Committee in September and reduced the hearing to an embarrassing filibuster session, even the committee\u2019s own members feared it had run up against a wall. \u201cWe have been engaged in this impeachment inquiry for a very long time and experiencing considerable frustration with the president\u2019s stonewalling,\u201d said Rhode Island representative David Cicilline, a committee member who is part of Pelosi\u2019s leadership team. \u201cWe have made our best effort to bring the contents of the Mueller investigation alive, but under very difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nAiming to streamline the investigation and minimize internal friction, Pelosi and her leadership group told the caucus a few days after announcing her support for the inquiry that Schiff\u2019s committee would take charge of looking into the president\u2019s actions, the Foreign Affairs Committee would look at the State Department and Rudy Giuliani\u2019s involvement, and the Oversight Committee would probe how the White House handled Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders. Judiciary would still bring the ultimate articles of impeachment. But under this new plan, the behind-the-scenes diggers and trusted messengers would handle phase one. The aggressive impeachers would step back in when the time comes to drop the hammer on Trump.\n\nIllustration: Tony Millionaire\n\nThroughout the 2018 midterm campaign, the operatives in charge of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) included a question about support for impeachment in the private national poll they ran every month to inform their strategy. The results, which were distributed to Pelosi and Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, the New Mexico representative then running the committee, found that while support for opening an impeachment inquiry tended to break along partisan lines, the idea of removing Trump from office was deeply unpopular \u2014 something like 15 to 20 points underwater, according to Democrats familiar with the data. Consultants working on individual races recalled seeing some polls in targeted districts where voters opposed impeachment by 40-point margins. When Democrats won the House, despite a flood of anti-Pelosi ads, DCCC leaders cautioned the new majority that Trump\u2019s alleged Russian collusion was too politically tricky to navigate in too many districts, said operatives familiar with the warning.\n\nBack in control, Pelosi made it clear she wouldn\u2019t close the door on impeachment, but she wanted her caucus to focus on policy. At least Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation was still up and running, impeachment advocates reminded one another hopefully. Meanwhile, the House\u2019s various investigative committees, led by Judiciary and Intelligence, ramped up their long-promised investigations of Trump. But high-profile steps forward were halting. Nadler\u2019s Judiciary panel had requested documents from 81 Trump associates early in the year but then dialed back their efforts amid worries from politically vulnerable House members (mostly young moderates who in 2018 won Republican-held districts); months later, after Mueller\u2019s testimony, Pelosi and those members chafed when progressive committee members went on TV in support of impeachment and began calling their work an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThen things changed. By the time of the Lewandowski hearing, Schiff\u2019s Intelligence Committee had learned of the whistle-blower complaint regarding Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, and four days before Lewandowski\u2019s testimony, the committee subpoenaed the acting director of national intelligence. By the end of the week, the country knew the complaint was about Trump pressuring Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Pelosi was watching closely, monitoring the waterfall of news but also sensing \u2014 according to those close to her \u2014 that the ground was moving under her caucus\u2019s feet. Here, it seemed, was a truly beyond-the-pale Trump act that was easy for average Americans to understand, without the weight of years of partisan warfare dragging it into the muck as Mueller\u2019s probe had been.\n\nAfter Mueller\u2019s testimony, Pelosi chafed when progressive committee members went on TV in support of impeachment.\n\nAs more details about Trump\u2019s call rushed out over the weekend, Pelosi was on the road \u2014 including for a pair of funerals, one in Washington and one in South Carolina\u2014and on the phone, speaking with undecided members as more lawmakers jumped onboard with the inquiry, figuring the case would be simple to make and there would be strength in numbers.\n\nThe politically vulnerable lawmakers were on the phone with one another, too. One group of seven freshmen Democrats with national-security backgrounds who represent swing districts \u2014 California\u2019s Gil Cisneros, Colorado\u2019s Jason Crow, Pennsylvania\u2019s Chrissy Houlahan, Virginia\u2019s Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger, New Jersey\u2019s Mikie Sherrill, and Michigan\u2019s Elissa Slotkin \u2014 determined on Saturday, in their preexisting group chat, that they had to say something. These were exactly the kind of middle-of-the-road members the remaining on-the-fence Democrats were watching for a signal that it was safe to step forward on impeachment. That Monday\u2014 the day news broke that Trump had held up aid to Ukraine before speaking with Zelensky \u2014 the group of seven and their aides submitted an op-ed to the Washington Post. Once it was edited and set to publish that evening, they called Pelosi to give her a heads-up.\n\nPelosi read the op-ed during her evening flight back to Washington from New York. She had already called House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer to tell him she would back the inquiry. She started drafting her remarks for a formal announcement but accidentally left them on the plane.\n\nIllustration: Zohar Lazar\n\nThe next morning, Trump called Pelosi, ostensibly to talk about gun control, but the now-inevitable inquiry naturally came up. He insisted he wasn\u2019t holding up the whistle-blower complaint, and she told him to release it, in her recounting to her caucus later in the day. She kept unrelated meetings on her schedule throughout the morning, telling a handful of members who were discussing a separate foreign-policy issue, \u201cAlea iacta est\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe die is cast,\u201d as Julius Caesar said when he crossed the Rubicon \u2014 according to a Democrat present at the meeting. By the early afternoon, she had gathered the chairs of the investigative committees and asked them to send Nadler their best cases for impeachment.\n\nWhen it came time to address the caucus later that day, the mood was \u201csomber [with] a sense of almost inevitability and something of the anticlimactic. We knew sooner or later we were going to end up at this point,\u201d said Virginia representative Gerry Connolly. \u201cIt was not a jubilant meeting. There was no high-fiving.\u201d\n\nPelosi told the caucus, \u201cThere is no question [Trump] has admitted that he brought up the investigation of the Biden family in his call. He is asking a foreign government to help him in his campaign. That is a betrayal of his \u2014 our \u2014 national security. And a betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\u201d Nonetheless, it took a few more days for some members of Pelosi\u2019s caucus to become comfortable with what was happening. Pelosi, Hoyer, Luj\u00e1n, DCCC chair Cheri Bustos, and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn sat down with \u201cfrontline\u201d lawmakers \u2014 ones Republicans will be targeting next November\u2014on September 26 to talk messaging, including how they hoped to keep House Democrats\u2019 drug-pricing initiatives and trade negotiations front and center, rather than allowing the party\u2019s national messaging to be overtaken by impeachment, as had happened to Republicans in 1998 and as the GOP was trying to ensure would happen to Democrats now.\n\nPelosi publicly and privately hammered home the message that this could not be seen as a political inquiry. \u201cWe have to be prayerful, somber, and nonpartisan,\u201d she said on her Sunday call with the caucus, the same call in which she made Schiff\u2019s role clear. The day before, she\u2019d been asked onstage in Austin why she\u2019d flipped. \u201cThe facts,\u201d she said simply. As she handed the call off to Schiff, she informed the caucus, \u201cI will only close by saying the polls have changed drastically about this.\u201d Hakeem Jeffries, the caucus chairman, shared his messaging advice, harping on a six-word framing: betrayal, abuse of power, national security. By October 8, a Washington Post poll showed Americans approved of the House\u2019s move to open the inquiry by a 20-point margin.\n\nFrom Mayor to Betrayer, by Jim Carrey. Illustration: Jim Carrey\n\nFor now, no Democrats are willing to speak with much specificity about the individual articles of impeachment they expect to bring against Trump. But \u201cthere is no longer any doubt in my mind that the House will act on an article, or articles, of impeachment,\u201d said Connolly. Trump will almost certainly be the third president to see charges from the House, even if the body\u2019s Democrats have no expectation that Senate Republicans will turn on him. Some members say they can see the outlines of individual articles of impeachment materializing, first from the president\u2019s Ukraine call and now from the administration\u2019s stated intention of obstructing the investigations. While they won\u2019t commit to a time line, many members see the impeachment playing out over the next few months; some are eager to wrap it up before the Democratic-presidential-primary voting begins in February.\n\nPelosi\u2019s team must manage its members\u2019 expectations, especially given that some still fear that, as Republicans hope, a messy impeachment and an inevitable Senate acquittal could propel Trump to reelection. (Former New York representative Steve Israel likened Pelosi to \u201cToscanini conducting a jazz-fusion orchestra.\u201d) Some members see merit in limiting the ultimate impeachment articles to the Ukraine call and excluding Mueller\u2019s findings. \u201cWe need to keep this focused and quick, although thorough,\u201d said Crow, a first-year congressman from the Denver area. \u201cWe have to get that in front of the American people, and we have to effectively communicate to them.\u201d But to members who\u2019ve been calling for impeachment for months, if not years, a strict Ukraine focus is \u201ctoo near, too simple and clever,\u201d in Connolly\u2019s words. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can ignore the other things that 138 of us thought merited impeachment, especially obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nThe investigative committees are now eager to test the limits of Trump and his allies\u2019 defiance (all the better to draw up impeachment articles based on obstruction, some members say). Trump \u201csounds more and more shrill,\u201d said Illinois representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight panels, a few hours after Trump accused Schiff of treason earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s not able to counter the specific allegations as laid out in the [whistle-blower] complaint. He feels he needs to engage in more ad hominem attacks, which signals we should really follow the facts wherever they lead us.\u201d They still have investigative paths they could follow without the administration\u2019s cooperation, including interviewing any further whistle-blowers and former government officials. If their tactics change in the coming weeks, it will almost certainly mean issuing more subpoenas.\n\nBut as the inquiry matures, Pelosi\u2019s leadership team hasn\u2019t sent rank-and-file Democrats talking points, and its messaging advice hasn\u2019t changed. They \u201cunderstand this is a deeply personal, member-by-member [situation], and we\u2019re gonna talk about it like we want to talk about it. The train has left the station,\u201d said Ruben Gallego, a Phoenix-area congressman who first called for an impeachment inquiry in July. \u201cThe president impeached himself by releasing the transcript. We don\u2019t have to overthink this.\u201d\n\n*This article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
