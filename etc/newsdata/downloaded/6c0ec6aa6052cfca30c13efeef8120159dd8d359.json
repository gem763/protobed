So what is it and why is it so controversial?\n\nBoris Johnson is attempting to rush one of the most complex laws in recent times through Parliament in just three days.\n\n\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) is the 110-page document that takes the Brexit deal Boris Johnson agreed with the EU last week, and puts it into UK law.\n\nBefore becoming an Act of Parliament it needs to pass a \u2018second reading\u2019 general vote, detailed amendments, then a final vote in the Commons - followed by the same process in the House of Lords.\n\n\n\nThe Bill is designed to ensure there aren\u2019t legal gaps in the UK when EU law automatically ends at 11pm on October 31 (or whenever Brexit actually happens).\n\nIt also encodes the 585-page Withdrawal Agreement, plus Boris Johnson\u2019s 64 pages of amendments, into law.\n\n(Image: Inknown)\n\nThis includes the arrangements for Northern Ireland in Boris Johnson\u2019s new deal - which force customs checks on goods travelling from Britain to Belfast.\n\nIt includes guarantees on the rights of EU citizens to stay, with a new \u2018independent monitoring authority\u2019 to ensure their rights are upheld.\n\nAnd it includes the \u00a339bn divorce bill and the transition period, which will extend all EU laws until 31 December 2020 while the UK and EU negotiate a permanent trade deal.\n\nThe Bill doesn\u2019t say what will happen in the future trade deal - that\u2019s a matter for the future. But it does force ministers to make a statement on objectives for it within 30 Commons sitting days of Brexit.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bill ditches the need for a separate meaningful vote on the deal - which Boris Johnson last tried to hold on Monday. Once the Bill becomes an Act, that\u2019s it - Brexit has been approved.\n\n\n\nBut it has huge controversies - read more about them here.", "description": "Boris Johnson is hurtling at breakneck speed to try to pass his Brexit deal - but it could fall apart within hours if MPs stop him rushing it through.
