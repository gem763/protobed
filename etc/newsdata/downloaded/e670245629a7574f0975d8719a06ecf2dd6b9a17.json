Every day between now and when the season opens Oct. 22 we will have at least one story focused on the upcoming season and the biggest questions heading into it. In addition, there will be podcasts, video and more. Come back every day and get ready for a wide-open NBA season.\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 You could see the impact almost immediately.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIn his first minutes in a Los Angeles Clippers uniform last Thursday against Denver, Kawhi Lenoard drained a 14-foot midrange shot, stole a Gary Harris pass and turned that into a step-back three-pointer. Five points and a steal, all in 21 seconds.\n\nMore importantly for the Clippers, you could hear the impact almost immediately, too.\n\nLeonard was talking a lot on defense, directing players and making his presence heard. That has been the case in team practices as well, according to people with the Clippers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more verbal than you would ever know,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cHe\u2019s more demanding in a very positive way. You have to do it right. I love that for our team.\u201d\n\nQuestions abound about how Leonard \u2014 and Paul George, when he returns at some point likely in November \u2014 will fit in with an established Clippers roster and culture this season. The Clippers on paper may be title favorites, but how all those pieces come together remains one of the potential turning points of this NBA season.\n\nThe cultural fit seems smooth.\n\nStory continues\n\nPatrick Beverley and Montrezl Harrell brought an intense, hard-working, tough-to-play-against ethos to Los Angeles \u2014 but Leonard and George are lunchpail guys at heart. The Clippers\u2019 new editions may be top five (certainly top eight) NBA talents, but they came into the league seen as \u201c3&D\u201d guys with some potential. They worked their way to the top, and that works for the Clippers.\n\nOn the court \u2014 at least in the slightly more than 10 minutes he played against Denver \u2014 the roster fit also seemed smooth.\n\nLeonard had seven points on 3-of-6 shooting, but what stood out were the six assists. Leonard played a facilitator role. The first bucket of the game was a Leonard drive-and-kick to JaMychal Green in the corner, who hit the three. Leonard\u2019s other assists were mostly to bigs Ivica Zubac and Harrell cutting to the basket.\n\nDoc Rivers\u2019 plan is to let Leonard feel how other teams are going to guard him, them adapt.\n\n\u201cSome teams will try to guard him one-on-one and he\u2019ll probably try to score,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cSome teams, like Denver today, was up doubling him a lot, and he\u2019ll be a facilitator\u2026\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Kawhi does, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re recreating anything here. He\u2019s a smart player. We\u2019re going to try and keep as much shooting out with him, so teams can\u2019t help. We will try to keep one roller on the floor with him, so that guy\u2019s going down the middle of the paint and he\u2019s creating help. We don\u2019t have to make it that difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe found me every time I was open,\u201d Zubac said. \u201cI really like playing with him.\u201d\n\nThis was not by direct design so much as Leonard taking what the defense gave him.\n\n\u201cIt just happened naturally,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cFor the most part I cause a lot of attention, and I\u2019m going to pass it to the open man. They was knocking down the shots tonight.\u201d\n\nWe will see more of \u201cfacilitator Leonard\u201d this season, and facilitator George as well. That Rivers wants to keep shooters on the court around his stars speaks to what a vital role Green and second-year guard Landry Shamet will play in Los Angeles \u2014 they are going to get opportunities and have to make the defense pay. (Shamet had 11 points against Denver and was 2-of-5 from three.)\n\nThen off the bench, Los Angeles rolls out the best pick-and-roll combo in the league right now, Lou Williams and Harrell. Those two drove the Clippers offense last season, which is why both finished in the top three in Sixth Man of the Year voting, but this season there will be less pressure on them. They may not even close games, even though Williams is one of the better end-game bucket getters in the league.\n\nThe Clippers are that deep with talent.\n\nLeonard showed already how he just makes the game easier for that talent. Zubac setting picks for Leonard and rolling, with shooters on the floor, is not going to be easy to stop \u2014 and that\u2019s without George in the mix yet.\n\nIt\u2019s more than the Xs and Os, however, Leonard and his rings just bring a gravitas to the Clippers they needed.\n\n\u201cHe has a presence about him when he is on the floor, just feels a little different, how he carries himself, how he plays,\u201d Shamet said.\n\nThat presence could carry the Clippers franchise to places it has never been before. It\u2019s the impact the Clippers are ultimately hoping to see.", "description": "The Clippers on paper may be title favorites, but how all those pieces come together remains a big question.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nSjVnPHz1vm36olt.vpuRA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MTkuMDgwNDU5NzcwMTE1/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UYGT2BXQdI6qPlQHvf9Zlg--~B/aD0zOTE7dz02OTY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/2429f2fb974116a988410f8a0337c81c", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
