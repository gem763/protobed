The online forum known as r/The_Donald considers itself a \u201cnever ending rally\u201d dedicated to President Trump. Or, at least it was until it was \u201cquarantined\u201d by its host site Reddit.\n\nFor the uninitiated, here\u2019s a quick primer on Reddit. Reddit is a website where users can post pictures, videos, articles, or links to anything else they want. Depending on how well these are appreciated, other users can either \u201cupvote\u201d or \u201cdownvote\u201d the original post. Reddit then looks at the balance of upvotes to downvotes and decides how popular a post is. More popular posts head to the top of the page, giving them even more visibility.\n\nWhile there is a \u201cfront page\u201d of the site\u2014where every post is sorted\u2014most users hang around specific topics on Reddit. There are different pages (or \u201csubreddits\u201d) for pretty much every topic you can imagine. Everything from pictures of beautiful places on earth, little-known facts, or fan pages for a beloved artist. So, naturally, there is a subreddit for President Donald J. Trump: r/The_Donald.\n\nHow It All Started\n\nOne of Reddit\u2019s more popular types of posts is when a celebrity, person of note, or someone with an interesting story answers live questions from people on the site. The format is known as \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d (AMA), and such events can easily garner thousands of comments. Nothing energized the r/The_Donald subreddit more than when President Trump himself did an AMA in July 2016. This was a significant moment. Just months before the 2016 election, the president chose to host his AMA in r/The_Donald.\n\nA month earlier, the Orlando nightclub shooting had occurred. As users tried to comment and share links about the tragedy, Reddit moderators intervened and removed news stories and posts. Once it became clear that the conversation was being censored on news subreddits, discussion migrated towards r/The_Donald and other forums.\n\nWhile the largely popular r/news subreddit lost thousands of subscribers and viewers while it stayed silent on the tragedy, more than a dozen posts from r/The_Donald reached the front page of Reddit as more users subscribed to the community. This was the first sign of users losing confidence that Reddit was an impartial website.\n\nThe r/The Donald subreddit quickly grew into a veritable online \u201chometown\u201d for Trump supporters and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d superfans, complete with its own brand of meme humor and often tongue-in-cheek posts mocking \u201cthe libs.\u201d It was in short order the place to be if you loved the president.\n\nReddit\u2019s \u2018Quarantine\u2019 Of r/The_Donald Is Hypocritical\n\nIn response, Reddit modified their algorithm to prevent r/The_Donald\u2019s posts from being appropriately indexed and reaching the front page. Now here we are again, dealing with another censorship issue, as the subreddit is the target of a quarantine.\n\nThe Reddit administrator\u2019s imposition of a \u201cquarantine\u201d on r/The_Donald might at first not seem like such a big deal. It is. Having your subreddit quarantined on Reddit means users need to manually \u201copt-in\u201d to view the website, after being greeted by an intimidating page that makes it appear as if what lies beyond is heinous or illegal.\n\nQuarantining a subreddit also makes it so that Google and Reddit will not display the subreddit in any search results or recommendations. This can be crippling. For most subreddits, it\u2019s a poison pill that few survive.\n\nReddit claimed the quarantine was due to users \u201cposting content that encourages or threatens violence\u201d targeting law enforcement in Oregon. However, the same standard is not applied to the r/politics subreddit which advertises itself as a section to discuss \u201cnews and U.S. politics.\u201d\n\nOf course, on r/politics the discussion can lean left and only left; any opinion that is even slightly right of center is marginalized or censored. The content found on r/The_Donald, while perhaps shocking to some, is often humorous and can only be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence if you have a far-left agenda and ulterior motives.\n\nReddit\u2019s \u2018Standards\u2019 Are Inconsistent and Ill-enforced\n\nThere are two reasons I believe this to be a phony quarantine with a sole purpose to quell political dissent. Firstly, any person can post in any subreddit under any username. In this vein, you or I can make threatening posts on a subreddit of our choice to give the impression that a certain community is geared towards or even rooted in violence. There is no way of knowing whether these \u201ccalls to violence\u201d were so-called \u201cNever Trumpers,\u201d radical social justice warriors, or assorted angry leftists masquerading as his supporters to vilify Trump supporters and the r/The_Donald subreddit.\n\nSecondly, posts promoting violence against dissenting voices frequently fester in the r/politics subreddit while Reddit turns a blind eye. The double standard would be hilarious if it were not so dangerous. By silencing conservative voices, Reddit increasingly showcases left-leaning opinions and discourages the free-flowing diversity of ideas that has flourished on the internet for so long. If Reddit continues on this path, all that remains is a giant echo chamber for liberal ideology.\n\nFor instance, in reference to Republican state lawmakers refusing to return to Oregon for a vote, one post on r/politics called for \u201ca shootout between law enforcement and a state senator who absolutely refuses to do his job.\u201d The post was heavily upvoted, a representation of support from forum users. Where was the outrage from Reddit\u2019s bosses? If this doesn\u2019t sound like a \u201cpost encouraging violence,\u201d then what is? Are the moderators asleep at the wheel or just willfully blind?\n\nBy allowing these posts to stay up and garner further upvotes, Reddit highlights its grotesque hypocrisy. Violence isn\u2019t \u201cagainst site policy,\u201d it\u2019s allowed as long as it is directed against a particular political bloc (in this case, against Republicans, conservatives, and their respective viewpoints).\n\nThere Is a Clear Bias on Reddit Against the Right\n\nThe curious case of r/politics and other similar subreddits highlight Reddit\u2019s clear bias against right-leaning voices. Left-leaning users are allowed to spread propaganda and openly endorse violence, while users on the right are afraid to post even a simple meme for fear of being targeted.\n\nEven worse, it is difficult for users to stumble upon r/The_Donald since Reddit blacklisted it from r/all, making it impossible for posts from the subreddit to reach the front page of the website. Simply because Reddit disagrees with the community\u2019s political stance, it believes the messages of r/The_Donald should be contained and \u201cquarantined\u201d as much as possible.\n\nThe quarantining of r/The_Doanld is a blatant attempt by a private company to prevent the president\u2019s base from organizing. By furthering the narrative that Trump voters are a fringe \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d Trump supporters are being deliberately pushed into obscurity.\n\nThe leftist administrators at Reddit want the public to buy the narrative that r/The_Donald supports violence and that right-leaning voices are dangerous. In truth, the group that we should be afraid of is the small section of the Democratic Party that appears to have no problem spreading violent propaganda (recall Tim Kaine\u2019s rallying cry for Democrats to \u201cfight in the streets\u201d), as well as censoring ideas and opinions they dislike.\n\nCompared to the r/politics subreddit, r/The_Donald appears tame. In the politics subreddit, pro-Democrat and anti-Republican sentiment is allowed to foment and become an axis for the hive mind to attack the president. While it\u2019s fine for there to be left-wing and right-wing sections of the website, Reddit\u2019s quarantine of r/The_Donald represents its clear slant against the right-wing perspective.\n\nPosts on the r/politics subreddit that praise Trump are immediately buried and downvoted. If a post even slightly leans towards supporting the president, it is quickly moved to the \u201coff-topic\u201d section, never to be seen again. There appears to be no place for actual political discourse in the Orwellian r/politics subreddit, which is now just a mouthpiece for the Democratic National Committee.\n\nUnfortunately, many who view front-page posts on the r/politics subreddit take these opinions as mainstream when they are actually representative of a radical, far-left community. Take a look at r/politics today and you will see exactly what I\u2019m talking about. There is zero diversity in opinion.\n\nThe Donald Trump Subreddit Survives, For Now\n\nDespite the deck stacked against it, the quarantine of r/The_Donald hasn\u2019t diluted users\u2019 support for the president. It has deepened the subreddit\u2019s resolve. Despite Reddit requiring an \u201copt-in\u201d action to view the subreddit\u2019s content, it has gained thousands of followers. Users have rallied behind its moderators in the fight to lift the containment policy.\n\nReddit\u2019s hypocritical and selective targeting of a conservative forum is exactly one of the issues that prompted President Trump to hold a Social Media Summit. Censorship has a chilling effect. It discourages people from sharing their opinion and taking part in the American tradition of free political discourse.\n\nOne of the most pressing issues of our time is how private organizations on the internet have begun to censor political speech. There is validity to the argument that private institutions can impose whatever rules they want over their users\u2014however draconian they may be. We can all agree certain images and topics don\u2019t have a place on the internet, just as everything isn\u2019t permitted in a public setting. However, once Reddit and Google begin censoring and monitoring the free speech of conservatives while hiding behind breaches against their personal \u201ccode of conduct,\u201d they prevent Americans from participating in a free and open political discourse.\n\nAmericans today need to get their hands on as much varied and critical information as possible. When Reddit stifles the views of only one side, it\u2019s the whole nation that suffers.", "description": "While ignoring explicit calls to violence on other pages, the leftist bosses at Reddit have stifled the r/The_Donald subreddit because of its viewpoints.", "authors": ["Seth King"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/25858555481_a0dc61d654_o1a-Custom.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-23"}
