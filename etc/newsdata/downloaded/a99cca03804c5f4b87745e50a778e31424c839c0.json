Walton said that investment is around $20 million, and thanked the government for opening the \"piggy bank.\"\n\nLaura Walton, president of the union representing around 55,000 education workers across Ontario, spoke to members of the media Sunday on a tentative deal reached with the provincial government that will avert a school strike. (Angelina King/CBC)\n\n\"Thanks for opening the piggy bank and allowing us to get the services that we needed for our students,\" she said.\n\nWalton says those who have benefited the most from this decision aren't workers, but students and parents.\n\n\"I think the students and families were the victors in this, we're just the people supporting them,\" she said.\n\nWhen I spoke with Walton one week ago, she said the union wanted security for workers and to ensure there wouldn\u2019t be further cuts. I asked if CUPE got that today. Here\u2019s her answer: <a href=\"https://t.co/07dK3X1RIi\">pic.twitter.com/07dK3X1RIi</a> \u2014@angelinaaking\n\nWalton said her union will hold ratification votes with the goal of finalizing the new collective agreement by the end of the month. In the meantime, the work-to-rule campaign by CUPE's education workers, which include clerical staff, education assistants and custodians, will end.\n\nFull terms of the deal were not immediately made available.\n\nThe Ontario Public School Boards' Association (OPSBA) says terms of the tentative deal are to be kept confidential until ratification.\n\n\"OPSBA will continue to negotiate with other unions representing teachers and education workers, with the best interests of students in mind,\" said OPSBA President Cathy Abraham in a news release Sunday.\n\nWalton apologized on Sunday for how long it took to be able to provide an update.\n\n\"Believe me this process has taken longer than I hoped it would,\" she said. \"I do regret the disruption to your lives.\"\n\nHad the province and the union failed to reach an agreement, many school boards around the province planned to close schools entirely. Parents were also warned to expect closures and disruptions of recreational and after-school programs.\n\nSee a timeline of talks below:\n\nWhile the dust settles for education workers, the unions representing Ontario's teachers are in the midst of bargaining with the Ford government and the province's school boards.\n\nRead the latest on the status of negotiations:", "description": "Some 55,000\u00a0education workers in Ontario will not strike Monday after successful last-minute contract talks with the provincial government, according to Education Minister Stephen Lecce.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311317.1570411576!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/toronto-ontario-education-minister-stephen-lecce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
