That would mean postponing the remaining debate and votes on the government's legislative plan as set out in last week's queen\u2019s speech, which are currently scheduled for the beginning of next week. That hasn't happened in British politics since 2006.\n\n\u201cWe can do the queen\u2019s speech anytime,\u201d the senior government figure said.\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson heads to the European Council summit, where he hopes EU leaders will agree a deal he thinks the House of Commons could support.\n\n\u201cIt will be more difficult to back a deal if the DUP have already ruled it out\" \u2014 John Redwood, Tory MP\n\nBut the chances of a breakthrough depend in part on what's happening back in London. Brussels will be keeping a close eye on domestic politics in the U.K. to decide whether any concessions are likely to clear the U.K. parliament and are therefore worth the risk.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar suggested Tuesday the Commons could stage an \"indicative vote\" \u2014 which it did in March to show its Brexit preferences. Downing Street has not ruled out splitting off the Withdrawal Agreement, the legal text of the deal, from the so-called Political Declaration, the non-binding statement about both sides' intentions for their future relationship. The former could then be put to the Commons alone at the weekend.\n\nKeep your friends close\n\nIf Johnson succeeds in Brussels, his first challenge back at home will be getting the sign-off from his confidence-and-supply partners in Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party. The DUP sounded the death knell for Theresa May when it refused to support her plan. Johnson is taking no such chances.\n\nThe prime minister or members of his top team have been in daily contact with party's leader Arlene Foster and its deputy leader Nigel Dodds (as well as other top DUP figures) during the final stages of the Brexit negotiations. The contact went up a notch in the days leading up to the summit, with face-to-face meetings on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in Downing Street. Johnson even staged a love-in rally with the top pair at Conservative Party conference. A Downing Street official said: \u201cTheir approval is crucial to us being able to present something.\u201d\n\nSupport from the DUP could unlock the next target faction: The European Research Group of hardcore Brexiteers. In March, 28 ERG members refused to back the May deal at the final time of asking \u2014 in part because the DUP rejected it.\n\nOne ERG member said support from the DUP for a new deal would \u201ctransform the chemistry.\u201d ERG MP John Redwood added: \u201cIt will be more difficult to back a deal if the DUP have already ruled it out.\u201d The Downing Street official said: \u201cHopefully support from the DUP makes it easier for other MPs to feel they are able to support a deal.\u201d\n\nNo. 10 is turning the screw as well. Tory Party whips have told ERG MPs they will be punished like the 21 Tory rebels who failed to support the government in key votes in September if they oppose a deal. That means being kicked out of the parliamentary party and effectively facing deselection as a Tory candidate at the next election \u2014 throwing away their plum jobs.\n\nERG chair Steve Baker reiterated that he would be willing to lose the whip if he feels he cannot support whatever may come back from Brussels.\n\nIf Johnson is able to get the ERG MPs on board, he will turn his focus to Labour MPs. There are a group of 20 or so who represent pro-Brexit seats and are flirting with the government by suggesting they could vote for a deal. These include Stephen Kinnock, Lisa Nandy and Gloria De Piero. But those MPs are reluctant to back an agreement unless their support will make sure it passes. Such a bold move would likely burn bridges with their own party.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has to have a clean go at getting what he believes to be a good deal over the line with MPs\" \u2014 A Downing Street official\n\nMay offered pro-Brexit Labour MPs a list of sweeteners to entice them into backing her deal, including cash for their constituencies and bolt-ons to the agreement, including on environmental protections and workers rights. Still only five backed it.\n\nThis time, Downing Street is taking a carrot-and-stick approach. Johnson has refused to tie bolt-ons to the deal, telling MPs to back it first and take a chance on adding them at a later stage of the legislative process. The Downing Street official said: \u201cThe prime minister has to have a clean go at getting what he believes to be a good deal over the line with MPs. This has to be a clear result on what the PM negotiates.\u201d\n\nLegislative headaches\n\nTo avoid being forced into a Brexit delay by a parliamentary mandate known as the Benn Act, Johnson must pass a deal at a showdown Commons sitting on Saturday. The prime minister has insisted he will not write a letter to Brussels requesting an extension, as the law requires, meaning another member of the government might have to.\n\nDowning Street has not yet ruled out trying to tweak or repeal the Benn Act in case a deal is almost but not quite in the bag by Saturday. \u201cWe are looking at what options are open to us,\u201d the official said.\n\nOne senior Tory MP outlined the letter they would write if given a chance: \u201cDear Brussels. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019ve got to ask for an extension because I\u2019m legally obliged to do so. But I\u2019m not going to pay you a penny during that extension and I\u2019m not going to be negotiating. How long an extension would you like to give us?\u201d\n\nEven then, MPs could press the PM into a fresh Brexit delay. On Sunday, former Chancellor Philip Hammond appeared to confirm he is mulling a way to force an extension even if Johnson secures a deal with the EU. He said parliament \u201cwill need to see the full detail of a deal, not just a headline, before it will approve anything.\u201d\n\nJohnson's legislative window could become even tighter if he fails to clinch an agreement with Brussels this week. Varadkar said on Wednesday that there could be a second European Council summit that could still see the U.K. leave the bloc on October 31. A Downing Street official said it was not possible to comment on timings, but said: \u201cWe have got to be open to making sure we get any deal through in the time available.\u201d\n\nDuring a committee hearing on Wednesday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barlcay again insisted the government would not seek a technical extension.\n\nOne risk however is that the opposition tries to frustrate the legislative process without securing an extension. Once parliament accepts a deal, the Benn Act dies, bringing the cliff edge back on October 31 should MPs try to attach amendments to Brexit legislation during later stages of the parliamentary process. The senior government figure said opposition MPs attempting to hold up the process at that point could end up with a no-deal Brexit \"by accident.\" A Labour spokesperson refused to discuss parliamentary tactics.\n\nOne last heave\n\nEven as Johnson heads to Brussels, MPs pushing for a second Brexit referendum are plotting ways to force one onto any deal he comes back with. Pro-EU campaigners believe Johnson will struggle to pass a deal unless a referendum is attached, but the parliamentary showdown on Saturday will provide a crunch moment for the future of the so-called People\u2019s Vote campaign.\n\n\u201cI think it would be harder to get a referendum if a deal passes without a referendum motion, but I seriously doubt that any deal can pass without a people\u2019s vote attached,\u201d said Mike Buckley, a coordinator working with the Labour for a Public Vote group.\n\nIf Brexit is seen to be delivered, it will be much harder to argue for brand new EU membership.\n\n\u201cIf a deal goes through and we don\u2019t attach a referendum to it, it\u2019s game over,\u201d another senior campaigner said. The campaigners' efforts would then turn to whether a referendum on the future partnership with the EU could be secured before the end of the Brexit transition period.\n\nMore complicated is how MPs might react if Johnson fails to bring a deal back from Brussels. Numerous opposition figures talk of seizing the Commons order paper on Saturday through an emergency debate application on Thursday. That would allow a motion, or even legislation, for a different kind of deal to be voted on \u2014 most likely the deal agreed by May with the concessions she offered to Labour MPs on things like workers\u2019 rights. Campaigners are unsure whether legislation could be drafted in time.\n\nBut MPs are split over whether that deal should have a second referendum bolted onto it or not.\n\nSome pro-deal MPs believe attaching a referendum would make the proposal less likely to carry. \u201cThe People\u2019s Vote lot are playing with fire by refusing to back it without a referendum clause,\u201d said one Labour MP who wants Brexit done. The MP said that if a second referendum did get support, it could still be taken out during the later legislative stages.\n\nPatrick Lohlein, co-ordinator for the Conservatives for a People\u2019s Vote campaign, said: \u201cI\u2019m very confident that a Withdrawal Agreement with a referendum attached to it would pass, but the numbers are quite tight.\u201d", "description": "Convincing EU leaders would be just the first step.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "David M.
