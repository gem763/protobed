Slamming the former vice president for doing what he said was a \u201cvery, very bad thing,\u201d Trump added: \u201cI didn\u2019t do it ... when you see the call [transcript], you\u2019re going to be very surprised.\u201d\n\nQuestioned by reporters during a one-on-one meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda Monday, Trump insisted that he \u201cput no pressure on them whatsoever,\u201d as public scrutiny continued to mount on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky during which Trump purportedly pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cI hope you get to see the call,\u201d Trump said, referring to a transcript of the conversation that he has faced pressure to release. \u201cI did not make a statement that, \u2018You have to do this or I\u2019m not going to give you A.\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump was noncommittal on whether the transcript of that call would be released, telling reporters that it would not set a good precedent.\n\nEarlier, he had questioned the patriotism of the whistleblower whose complaint about deni Trump had increased the focus on the July 25 call.\n\n\u201cAlso, who is this so-called \u2018whistleblower\u2019 who doesn\u2019t know the correct facts,\u201d Trump said in a tweet as he attended a United Nations gathering in New York. \u201cIs he on our Country\u2019s side. Where does he come from.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments came a day after he appeared to confirm that he mentioned Biden, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son, Hunter Biden, in the call with Zelensky. The call is part of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nSpeaking to reporters as he arrived at the United Nations, Trump also appeared to acknowledge that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was part of the conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption,\u201d Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about the contents of the call. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country you think is corrupt? One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption, so it\u2019s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d\n\n[Fact-checking Trump\u2019s latest claims on Biden and Ukraine]\n\n\n\nPresident Trump briefly attends the United Nations Climate Action Summit on Monday in New York. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nTrump has repeatedly raised the specter of impropriety on the part of Biden and his son, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that Trump pushed Zelensky to investigate, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nActing director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire has been unwilling to turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress, a refusal that has rankled Democrats and heightened calls to impeach Trump. The whistleblower, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, is said to be a U.S. intelligence official.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Monday, Trump said that he is not worried about impeachment and that \u201cthe one who\u2019s got the problem is Biden.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Biden did is a disgrace,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly asserted that he said nothing wrong during the call, on Sunday characterizing it as \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say asking Ukraine to find damaging information on a potential 2020 rival could amount to another attempt to involve a foreign power in U.S. elections. Intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump, a claim the president denies.\n\n[GOP rival Bill Weld says Trump has committed \u2018treason, pure and simple\u2019]\n\nSince the spring, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, has pushed the Ukrainians to investigate a gas tycoon who had Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma Holdings starting in 2014.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, he was paid as much as $50,000 some months for his work.\n\nIn 2016, then-Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Ukraine to push for the firing of its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. On that trip, Biden said the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Shokin was removed.\n\nBiden\u2019s push was part of a broader international effort to fight corruption in Ukraine, and Shokin had been accused of ignoring major misconduct. Shokin, at one point, led an investigation into Burisma Holdings. However, the case had been dormant before the prosecutor\u2019s firing, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials, and the U.S. ambassador at the time publicly called for the investigation in Burisma to proceed.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who met with Zelensky in Ukraine in early September, said Monday that the Ukrainian president directly expressed his concern that military aid was being cut off to his country by Trump as \u201ca consequence\u201d of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, Murphy said Zelensky was resisting the investigation because \u201cthey thought there was no merit to it\u201d and that Zelensky asked him \u201cto intervene to unlock the aid.\u201d\n\nMurphy called Trump\u2019s efforts \u201ca fundamentally corrupt act\u201d but cautioned on focusing on whether there was \u201can explicit quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it really matters whether there was a quid pro quo. . . . whether the president explicitly told the Ukrainians that they wouldn\u2019t get their security aid if they didn\u2019t interfere in the 2020 elections,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThere is an implicit threat in every demand that a United States president makes of a foreign power.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) demanding several steps related to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, including a release of the transcript.\n\nSchumer also asked for Senate hearings on the matter and the issuance of a subpoena to compel the delivery of the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Monday that the actions by Biden merit more scrutiny but also urged Trump to release more details about his call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cI would urge him to continue to be as transparent as possible and tell us as much as he can without compromising executive privilege, so that we can understand what happened,\u201d Graham told conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt, adding: \u201cI believe that President Trump is going to blow you away with his willingness to disclose and be transparent about this phone call, because I think he did nothing wrong, and he has nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nEarlier Monday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham was noncommittal when asked whether Trump plans to release a transcript of his call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cWhen foreign leaders come together to speak, they need to be able to speak candidly, so I do think that perhaps releasing this kind of transcript could set a bad precedent,\u201d Grisham said on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s willing to do it, I think, but there\u2019s a lot of other people, lawyers and such, that may have a problem with it, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters on Sunday that he would \u201clove to\u201d release the transcript but that others in his administration are \u201ca little shy\u201d about it.\n\nIn an exchange with reporters outside the White House on Sunday before departing for events in Texas and Ohio, Trump appeared to suggest that he did speak about Biden with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s got a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nLater, in Houston, Trump appeared to backtrack, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t even want to mention it, but certainly I\u2019d have the right to\u201d raise Biden\u2019s name with Zelensky.\n\nKaroun Demirjian, Paul Kane, and Felicia Sonmez contributed to this report.", "description": "Questioned by reporters at the United Nations, Trump insisted that he\u00a0\u201cput no pressure on them whatsoever\u201d on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July 25 call.", "authors": ["Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CbRx2ld3td7zTkCsOmPyUqMxdD8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IHMMYMW6DUI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
