A whistleblower report released on Thursday alleged that President Donald Trump attempted to coerce Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, and that White House officials acted to conceal evidence of his actions. The controversy around the report prompted House Democrats this week to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. Indeed, markets overall have seen only a fleeting impact overall.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, gold has fallen since the impeachment proceedings were announced with investors preferring the dollar as protection from political uncertainty,\u201d said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, in a note.\n\nGold remains up more than 17% in the year to date, with gains tied by many analysts to escalations in the U.S.-China trade war and other geopolitical tensions. Lawler, however, said the recent price action undermines that argument.\n\n\u201cThis firms up our view that the rally in gold prices this year has not primarily been a function of haven flows but as protection from currency devaluation. As such we think overall impeachment is neutral for gold,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.03%, a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was little changed at 99.156 but holding near a more-than-two-year high. The index is up 0.7% this week.\n\nIn other metals trade, January platinum PLF20, -1.57% fell 1.5% to $928.10 an ounce, while December palladium PAZ19, -0.98% shed 1% to $1,625 an ounce.\n\nDecember copper futures HGZ19, +0.56% were up 0.7% at $2.5955 a pound.", "description": "Gold heads for a weekly loss, failing to find haven-related support as the U.S. dollar flexes its muschles.", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX670_goldst_ZG_20181102071937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
