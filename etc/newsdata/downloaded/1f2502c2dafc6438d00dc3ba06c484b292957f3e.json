We're very harsh on new food and drink meeting certain criteria, but we have a blind spot towards alcohol because it's so embedded into our culture.\n\n\"The German court case was interesting. At Imperial, we've been looking at what goes on in a hung-over brain. Economically, hangovers are an enormously important issue, but there's little data around them. The UK suffers its fair share, but we're not the worst in Europe. Mediterranean countries fare better because they drink mindfully and sensibly, and spread it out over meal times, which is better for the brain.\"\n\nSo what exactly is going on in our weary bodies and throbbing heads the morning after?\n\n\"There's dehydration,\" says Nutt. \"There's inflammation of the brain, which is on a par with a bad cold or flu. The pumping headache is caused by an increase in blood pressure. In fact, incidences of strokes go up on a Sunday and Monday due to weekend alcohol consumption.\n\n\"And then there's hangxiety - hang-over anxiety - which is due to something called Gaba (gamma-aminobutyric acid),\" explains Nutt. \"Alcohol targets the Gaba receptor, which sends messages through the brain and nervous system to inhibit the activity of nerve cells, which calms the brain. Alcohol stimulates Gaba, which is why you begin to unwind and feel happy when you drink.\"\n\nAfter the first few drinks, you start blocking glutamate, which causes anxiety, and this leads to the devil-may-care stage that sees you buying another round and missing your last train. However, the body registers these imbalances and begins to bring Gaba levels down and glutamate back up. So, overnight, the happy, carefree you in the pub becomes the anxious, mildly depressed one you see in the bathroom mirror the next morning.\n\n\"Then there's sleep,\" continues Nutt. \"After four hours of going to bed, withdrawal kicks in, so you don't sleep particularly well. Water before bed to stave off a hangover, or drinking a lot of beer, means getting up early to go to the lavatory, which affects sleep further. And a lack of sleep makes hangxiety worse.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlutamate also plays a role in memory, and after around seven drinks the glutamate system is blocked. And if you can't remember what you said in the pub, it further increases hangxiety.\n\nIf you're shy, you'll suffer more, according to a study published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, which found introverted people suffer more hangxiety. \"The people who were more shy had much higher levels of anxiety [the following day] than the people who weren't shy,\" said Celia Morgan, professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Exeter, who worked on the study. \"It could also be a psychological effect - people who are more highly anxious are more prone to rumination, going over thoughts about the night before, so that's another potential mechanism.\"\n\nSo do hangovers get worse with age? \"There's no evidence they do,\" says Sally Adams, an assistant professor in health psychology at the University of Bath. \"Liver mass reduces with age, so your liver is less effective at metabolising alcohol.\n\n\"But you usually binge drink less in midlife, compared with university, so you're less tolerant. And there are social reasons, too. When you have a big job and a family, you feel more shame and anxiety over binge drinking. There's no medical reason for worsening hangxiety, you just have more responsibilities, which means more guilt for briefly neglecting them.\"\n\nSo is there a cure? \"The usual things, like spreading out your drinking and having water in between alcoholic drinks helps,\" says Nutt. \"Ibuprofen is better than paracetamol, because it's anti-inflammatory.\" Nutt also suggests addressing any social anxiety that may lead you to overdrink in the first place.\n\nHe has also developed a drink called Alcarelle, which aims to take the good bits of alcohol, but without the harmful or hangover-inducing ones. Hair of the dog is, he says, a slippery slope and best avoided.\n\n\"If you can stomach it, a hefty breakfast may help. But we don't really know for sure because there's almost no research into hangovers, despite how common and costly they are. People simply laugh them off or hide them and soldier on. But while hangover effects wear off after a day, the effect on your body lasts, and regular drinking takes years off your life.\n\n\"Alcohol is a social drug. However, the social benefits are quite enormous. Think about it: the social gatherings of humans over history have been drink-related, from knees-ups in pubs, to wine in churches, beers at sports games, and drinking around the Christmas table with loved ones. Alcohol breaks down social barriers and brings people together, and adds a wonderful flavour to life.\"\n\nIf only it didn't lead to such wretched hangovers.\n\nThe Telegraph London", "description": "If alcohol was invented today, the recommended safe dose would be about a glass of wine a year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8454%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7e0f5b3e0ee41d14dbeea5d877a639970f3c8679", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
