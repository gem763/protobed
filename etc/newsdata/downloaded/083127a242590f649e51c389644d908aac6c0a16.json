Desperate to feel like part of the club, a certain sect on the right long for his retweets and snarky acceptance. Even when he steps out of bounds, they lay off just to be sure to not burn any precious bridges. Because of this they paint a mythical picture of Tapper just being a straight news guy. Never mind his long history of partisanship or the fact that he\u2019s a Democrat, by golly he\u2019s fair.\n\nSen. Joe Kennedy was on Tapper\u2019s show yesterday and got a taste of his fairness. It ended in Tapper making a ludicrous comparison and getting fact-checked.\n\nThe Daily Caller provides some excerpts.\n\n\u201cBut the Senate intelligence committee, run by your colleague Republican Senator Richard Burr, also has a great many hearings and depositions completely in private,\u201d Tapper said. \u201cCompletely in private.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Kennedy nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d \u201cAnd Democrats are allowed to participate \u2026\u201d Tapper continued. \u201cThat is classified information,\u201d Kennedy interrupted. \u201cThey are dealing with classified information.\u201d \u201cNot everything,\u201d said the CNN anchor.\n\nI want to stop here because you\u2019d think a newsman like Tapper would understand the difference between the Senate Intel Committee, which by definition deals with classified intelligence, and an \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d which is political by its very definition. You know what else the Senate Intel Committee doesn\u2019t do? Selectively leak from every interview in order to push a public, partisan narrative.\n\nTapper might have an argument if Schiff weren\u2019t leaking like a sieve to bolster his political position. The claim that things must be kept secret, even while these leaks occur doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. Has Tapper asked Schiff during one his near hourly CNN hits why it\u2019s acceptable for a 15 page opening statement to end up in the public domain but not the other 10 hours of testimony which contain all the context? Of course he hasn\u2019t.\n\nEventually, Joe Kennedy would set the record straight.\n\n\u201cAlmost all of it is,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cThere is no classified information here.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Tapper was even trying to make that line of argument shows how biased he is. The is absolutely nothing Schiff is doing in the SCIF requires secrecy. There is no classified information being exchanged or studied. He\u2019s using the SCIF as a political shield and the media are happy to play along. Trying to compare that to the Senate Intel Committee is just disingenuous on its face.\n\nTapper was crying last weekend because Republicans were refusing to come on his show. I can\u2019t imagine why they would pass with this kind of interviewing, right? You\u2019d think a fair guy like Tapper would be going after Democrats for their secrecy and game playing, but nah. All the sudden the media love closed door hearings and being kept out of the loop.\n\nImpeachment is literally the attempted removal of a duly elected President from office. There\u2019s a reason the historical precedent is to keep it as transparent as possible, vote on rules, and allow the minority certain powers. What Schiff is perpetrating is a travesty and deserves to be called out, not excused by hacks like Tapper.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
