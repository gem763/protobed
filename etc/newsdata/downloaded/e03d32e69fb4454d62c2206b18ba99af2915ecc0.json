Photo: Paola Kudacki\n\nAt the heart of Egypt\u2019s ancient history is the 14th-century-BCE pharaoh Akhenaten, a leader depicted with full lips, a long nose, and evident breasts. At the heart of the visual cornucopia in Philip Glass\u2019s 1983 opera Akhnaten is Anthony Roth Costanzo, a slender singer with full lips, a long nose, and a voice so high and clear it seems implausible coming from a man\u2019s throat. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around the historical figure, who is almost as famous for the woman he married (Nefertiti) as for his own accomplishments, which were considerable: He forced his nation to jettison the old gods and worship a single deity, making him the first great leader of monotheism; later rulers found his radicalism so extreme they all but obliterated him from the historical record. (Glass accentuates the mystery by having the libretto sung in ancient languages.) Costanzo, the countertenor who sings the role in the wandering production, which will make its way to the Metropolitan Opera House in November, calls his sexually ambiguous character \u201cthe first trans icon.\u201d Costanzo initially appears onstage bald, naked, waxed, and then, as gradually as only Glass can command, he dons the robes of majesty.\n\nCostanzo is a fast-talking enthusiast who has kept the engines of his career perpetually revved. Now 37, he made his debut at 11 as part of the touring company of the Broadway show Falsettos and two years later sang the role of Miles in Benjamin Britten\u2019s darkly creepy opera The Turn of the Screw, based on the story by Henry James. \u201cMy parents were both psychologists,\u201d Costanzo says, \u201cand that\u2019s such a psychologically tortured story! We\u2019d drive out to New Jersey together for rehearsals and talk about sexual abuse and trauma.\u201d It was then that a vocal coach informed him that, judging by the hair on his arms, he wasn\u2019t just a boy soprano anymore but an honest-to-goodness countertenor. Somehow, while at Princeton, he talked 11 department chairs plus the administration into funding his senior thesis \u2014 a sung spectacle about the fictional 18th-century castrato Zefirino \u2014 as well as a documentary about the show. These days, he bubbles over with plans for interdisciplinary collaborations and multimedia productions like Glass Handel, a blowout he produced and performed, which included music videos by the likes of Tilda Swinton and Maurizio Cattelan. (Costanzo doesn\u2019t so much drop names as scatter them like seeds.)\n\nSinging Glass, though, has taught him the virtues of slowness. \u201cOpera time, when you\u2019re performing, feels so stretched out that it can feel uncomfortable to live in that world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as you do it more, you find ways to make that seem natural.\u201d In a Handel aria, a countertenor\u2019s typical habitat, the character makes an emotional declaration, moves on to a connected or contrasting thought, and then repeats the whole speech from the beginning (\u201cda capo\u201d), often supercharged with extra filigrees of notes and expression. Glass, however, breaks a sentence (which might be ancient Egyptian or Hebrew in this case) down into fragments and has the singer repeat them obsessively.\n\nThat kind of repetition can be just as natural as the Handelian kind, Costanzo says: \u201cIf I have a crush on someone and they text me something, I\u2019ll look at that like five times. When the stakes are high, you go into Philip Glass mode.\u201d And, he points out, a lot of people will attend an opera in a language they don\u2019t understand about a figure they\u2019ve barely heard of and still have an idea of what to expect. \u201cIf I go on Tinder and say I\u2019m singing Philip Glass, and they know who that is, it\u2019s a pretty good litmus test.\u201d\n\nAkhnaten premieres November 8 at the Metropolitan Opera.\n\n*This article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
