CEO William Demchak and former U.S. Bancorp chief Richard Davis, according to people familiar with the matter. Messrs. Demchak and Davis took a pass on potentially replacing Timothy Sloan, who resigned in late March, the people said.\n\nWells Fargo continues to pursue Mr. Smith, who is JPMorgan\u2019s co-chief operating officer, but he has told confidants that he is reluctant to take the job and is likely to stay at JPMorgan, some of the people said.\n\nRunning the fourth-largest bank in the U.S. is one of the biggest jobs in the business, but it is not a universally appealing one. Wells Fargo\u2019s new CEO will have to juggle fixing problems in Washington, reviving key businesses and rehabilitating a corporate reputation damaged by many problems that came to light following the bank\u2019s 2016 fake-account scandal.\n\nAny professional glory to be earned turning around the bank is likely years away. Wells Fargo has a long to-do list from regulators and is operating under an unprecedented growth cap imposed by the Federal Reserve in early 2018.\n\nMr. Smith, 60 years old, oversees JPMorgan\u2019s consumer operations and its community bank. He is considered a top candidate to run the bank if Chief Executive James Dimon departs suddenly, but his age makes him less likely to get the job if Mr. Dimon retires in around four years, as planned.\n\nMr. Smith would be an expensive hire. He is owed more than $50 million in long-term compensation, some of which Wells Fargo likely would have to cover. The British-born executive, who joined JPMorgan in 2007 from American Express Co. , was paid $22 million in 2018.\n\nIt is unusual for big, publicly traded companies to go months without a permanent CEO, let alone a bank the size of Wells Fargo. Boards typically line up successors years ahead of time. The most recent big bank in a similar situation was the financial-crisis-era Bank of America Corp. , which took nearly three months to name a replacement after Kenneth Lewis announced plans to retire.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s general counsel, former Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP partner C. Allen Parker, has been serving as interim CEO since Mr. Sloan\u2019s departure.\n\nProminent figures in the banking business have puzzled over the board\u2019s approach to the search, publicly and privately. Mr. Dimon recently took Wells Fargo directors to task for their succession planning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not responsible for a company\u2014just my own view\u2014to have a CEO leave with no plan in place,\u201d he said at an investor conference in late May. \u201cI don\u2019t personally understand that.\u201d\n\nWhatever succession planning the board had done was upended when Mr. Sloan, a 31-year Wells Fargo veteran, resigned. Finance chief John Shrewsberry had been considered a potential successor, people familiar with the matter said, but the board decided to look for an outsider after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, the bank\u2019s main overseers in Washington, expressed dissatisfaction with its response to its troubles.\n\nThere are other factors complicating the search. Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the bank\u2019s largest shareholder, spoke out against hiring anyone with Wall Street roots. Regulators, too, are taking an active role in the process.\n\nThe OCC must approve the new CEO under the terms of an agreement the bank entered into last year. The regulator has sent the bank a letter that outlines what it expects it to do in the process of vetting potential candidates, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe CEO search got off to a slow start. Once Mr. Sloan\u2019s departure was announced, it took the board weeks to hire an executive search firm.\n\nThe firm, Spencer Stuart, started with the small group of top candidates, including Messrs. Demchak, Smith and Davis, with extensive experience in Main Street banking, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Demchak said he had no plans to leave PNC on his bank\u2019s quarterly earnings call in April; he and Mr. Davis told Wells Fargo representatives that they don\u2019t want the job, some of the people said.\n\nThe CEO search has set off a guessing game around the banking business. Yet some people considered worthy candidates by their peers recently hadn\u2019t heard from recruiters, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThat could reflect the influence of Berkshire Hathaway, which owns 9% of the bank\u2019s shares.\n\nIn an April interview with the Financial Times, Mr. Buffett said Wells Fargo\u2019s new CEO \u201cshouldn\u2019t come from Wall Street\u201d and \u201cprobably shouldn\u2019t come from JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs . \u201d Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal \u201cwe don\u2019t like the Wall Street crowd that is making the damn decisions.\u201d\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped employees at rival banks from speculating about their executives landing the job. On April 1, Citigroup Inc. employees emailed each other a fake Wall Street Journal article that said the bank\u2019s Latin America head Jane Fraser would replace Mr. Sloan.\n\n\u2014Andrew Ackerman and Liz Hoffman contributed to this article.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nGordon Smith is CEO of JPMorgan\u2019s consumer and community bank. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said CEO of the consumer and commercial bank.(June 11, 2019)\n\nWrite to Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com and David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com", "description": "Wells Fargo is having trouble getting top bankers interested in its open CEO job.
