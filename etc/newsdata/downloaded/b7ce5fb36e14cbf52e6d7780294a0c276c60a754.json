Trying to suss out what this could mean for Google, its Wear OS platform, and Fitbit\u2019s customers is (pardon the fitness pun) exhausting.\n\nHere\u2019s where I landed: Assuming it bears out, I think that this acquisition portends a wearables reboot instead of shoring up Google\u2019s current smartwatch strategy. I think that mainly because Google\u2019s current smartwatch strategy isn\u2019t helped by Fitbit \u2014 at all. Unless Google has completely lost the thread, this acquisition only makes sense if the company is ready to try something completely different.\n\nIt certainly should be.\n\nLet\u2019s just recap how poorly things are going for Wear OS. Google\u2019s most prolific partner in making Wear OS watches, Fossil, had a sub-five-percent marketshare in North America in Q2. Even if you give Google credit for some piece of the \u201cOthers\u201d in Canalys\u2019 estimates, that leaves Wear OS\u2019 marketshare hovering somewhere between wince and woof.\n\nCommand Line is The Verge\u2019s daily newsletter about computers, gadgets, and software.

Even so, in terms of basic usability and features, Wear OS is a fairly solid platform on which to rebuild \u2014 if only there were hardware to go with it.\n\nThat hardware is not imminent. The best Wear OS watch hardware currently available is Fossil\u2019s latest generation. Reviewing one of those watches, I discovered that many of Wear OS\u2019 performance problems are solved simply by adding more RAM, though that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it very fast.\n\nBut even with enough RAM to run (which few Wear OS watches have), the convolutions the new Fossil watches go through to get through a full day of use are amongst the silliest I\u2019ve seen on any device. There are settings on settings, none of which should ever be visible on a smartwatch, much less necessary.\n\nThose convolutions are necessary because Qualcomm has yet to provide a processor for smartwatches that is worth a damn. We spent years waiting for the Snapdragon 3100 that powers the Fossil I cite above, but it is still outdated at its core in terms of both speed and battery management.\n\nA more recent rumor from XDA suggests that Qualcomm is developing a new chip that would represent a significant step forward \u2014 but that just puts us back to where we started. Do we \u2014 and does Google \u2014 really want to wait (again) for Qualcomm to come through?\n\nBack when it first launched Android Wear, Google made a bet that it could replicate the Android model with watches: distribute free software to companies that could use readily-available components to create their own devices. LG, Motorola, and even Samsung all took a chance on that vision and it didn\u2019t go well for any of them.\n\nThat model just didn\u2019t pan out. I could be convinced that\u2019s because the only way to make a great smartwatch is to be vertically integrated from silicon to software. You don\u2019t need to just cite the Apple Watch to make that case, either. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch Active line is successful not because the Tizen OS is great (though it\u2019s not bad), but because Samsung is nearly Apple-esque in its vertical integration on the smartwatch.\n\nI could just as easily be convinced that Google\u2019s original bet could have led to good smartwatches in the same way that it led to good Android phones. The problem in that scenario is that since the ecosystem didn\u2019t develop, there was no incentive for component makers to support smartwatches. You could call it it a chicken and egg problem, but it\u2019s actually simpler than that. There\u2019s no reason for Qualcomm to raise chickens if nobody\u2019s buying the eggs.\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to fix Google\u2019s current smartwatch woes: it\u2019s the silicon, stupid. And while Google\u2019s lack of control over processors didn\u2019t hurt Android phones, it sure does seem to be holding back Android smartwatches.\n\nQualcomm won\u2019t bother raising chickens if nobody is buying any eggs\n\nI don\u2019t blame Qualcomm entirely \u2014 from where I\u2019m sitting, the company has acted rationally. It surely makes much more money focusing on smartphone chips, high-end chips that could lead to Windows on ARM, and tiny chips that are about to power an entire generation of noise-cancelling earbuds to compete with the just-announced AirPods Pro.\n\nAll of this history leads us to 2019 and the Fitbit rumor. I sincerely doubt that Fitbit is sitting on a revolutionary processor that can save Google\u2019s smartwatch efforts. Google\u2019s current smartwatch problems can\u2019t be solved with Fitbit.\n\nI think it\u2019s much more likely that Google intents to just pivot to where Fitbit already is: selling cheaper, lower-end fitness trackers and basic smartwatches.\n\nIt\u2019s a much better strategy than trying to take on the Apple Watch \u2014 or heck, even the Galaxy Watch \u2014 head on. Maybe Qualcomm will come through with that new chip, but Google would be silly to bet its entire wearables future on it. (If you\u2019re wondering where that mysterious $40 million Fossil smartwatch technology acquisition fits into all this, join the club. We have hats!)\n\nThere\u2019s another reason Google might want Fitbit: its dedicated user base. Hopefully Google sees them as a core group of customers to serve well with expanded, improved fitness offerings, so that they might evangelize Fitbit again. Hopefully it\u2019s not to take whatever fitness data Fitbit has collected and collated and use it to troubling ends. Even with the rumors of a buyout still very fresh, that\u2019s something that Fitbit users are already worried about.\n\nFor f-\u2018s sake. I did not buy a sodding Fitbit in order to give Google the entire motherlode of my intimate biological data. I did not consent to this so I sincerely hope they\u2019ve done their Euro due diligence https://t.co/lrbG7J6p9l \u2014 Carole Cadwalladr (@carolecadwalla) October 28, 2019\n\nI can\u2019t entirely blame them. Since it\u2019s so hard to know what exactly Google would do with Fitbit, it\u2019s easy to assume the worst. If the acquisition turns out to be real, I hope Google will do a better job communicating its intentions than it did with Nest.\n\nAnd I hope Google knows its intentions better than it did with Nest, too.\n\nMore from The Verge\n\nOne quick note about the newsletter. Apologies for not sending one out Monday morning \u2014 or more specifically, not warning you on Friday that I might not. As always, I welcome your feedback - dieter@theverge.com\n\n+ Apple announces AirPods Pro with noise cancellation, coming October 30th\n\n$249 seems like quite a premium, especially compared to Amazon\u2019s forthcoming Echo Buds. I am sure a bunch of people will just up and buy them and be very happy with them \u2014 especially since the H1 chip will make them integrate better with Apple\u2019s products than non-Apple Bluetooth headphones can. I\u2019d recommend holding off to see if the sound quality justifies anything close to that price point, though.\n\n+ Apple\u2019s HomePod now supports multiple users with HomePod 13.2 update. Now do iPadOS.\n\n+ iOS 13.2 reveals Apple\u2019s Tile-like device could be called AirTag\n\nIt seems possible that we could be in for a week of \u201csurprise\u201d Apple announcements. Back in March it had a week of press release announcements for relatively minor product updates. Today\u2019s AirPods Pro announcement is more than minor, but it could foretell other stuff like the above AirTags.\n\nSure looks like we\u2019re not getting another Apple keynote this fall, though. To me the big question is whether or not Apple puts out that long-rumored 16-inch MacBook Pro via press release so as to avoid the embarrassment of talking about keyboards on stage. As I wrote before, that would be a choice and one I don\u2019t think Apple should make. It would not, as they say, be courageous.\n\n+ A summit in Egypt will decide the future of 5G and weather forecasts\n\nWhat if instead of treating 5G like a race, we slowed the hell down and thought about the repercussions a bit more. In the US, at least, these are our airwaves, not the carriers\u2019, and their desire to open up new business lines isn\u2019t the same thing as the public interest.\n\nThe worry is that the rollout could inadvertently throw off weather forecasting, they say, because 5G networks are planning to use a frequency band very close to the one satellites use to observe water vapor. That interference could cost lives and fortunes when it comes to preparing for disastrous weather events.\n\n+ Smart home platform Wink is dying as Will.i.am\u2019s tech company is low on money\n\n+ The first widely available electric Mini will start at $29,900\n\nThat range, though :(\n\n+ Uber unveils a new look for its food delivery drones\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not possible to make one of these things not look ominous, but it\u2019s like they didn\u2019t even try.\n\n+ DJI Mavic Mini images and specs leak in new retailer listing\n\nReleasing a drone that weighs literally one gram less than the cutoff for required FAA registration is incredible.\n\n+ Microsoft leak reveals Windows 10X will be coming to laptops\n\nThe below quote threatened to turn into an entire other essay for this newsletter. Suffice to say I\u2019ll revisit it later, but the TL;DR is nobody knows how to move the desktop forward. Apple with Catalyst, Google with Android on Chrome OS, and Microsoft with ...whatever this is \u2014 all of them are flailing in the dark, hoping to grab hold of something solid.\n\nOn the Office side, it appears Microsoft is prioritizing traditional Win32 versions of Office and the PWA web versions from Office.com for Windows 10X over UWP. Microsoft does have UWP versions of its Office Mobile apps, but the company put the development of those on hold last year. We\u2019ll likely see a significant investment in the web versions of Office over the coming year before Windows 10X ships on the Surface Neo for holiday 2020.\n\nReviews\n\n+ Nvidia Shield TV (2019) review: totally tubular\n\nColor me surprised: I did not expect that 4K upscaling could actually be good, but Chris Welch was impressed.\n\nNvidia\u2019s system makes a noticeable difference, and it\u2019s not just blanketing everything with a coat of sharpening. The AI upscaling doesn\u2019t work for 60fps video, nor does it run when you\u2019re playing games. But for everything else, you can have it optimizing the on-screen picture at all times. And I came away very impressed.\n\n+ Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 13.5-inch review: have a normal one\n\n+ Beats Solo Pro review: beat the noise\n\nDefinitely watch the video on this one. The lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack on these things means I will never ever buy them. The cable to connect 3.5mm audio to the lightning port is $35 (thirty five dollars). It would be insulting if it weren\u2019t so crassly audacious.", "description": "Assuming it bears out, I think that this acquisition portends a wearables reboot instead of shoring up Google\u2019s current smartwatch strategy.
