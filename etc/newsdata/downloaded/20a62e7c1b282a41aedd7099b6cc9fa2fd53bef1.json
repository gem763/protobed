Kamala Harris of California after he slammed the Democratic presidential candidate Friday for supposedly being unfunny.\n\n\u201cWhy is @KamalaHarris the only person that laughs at her jokes\u2026 always way to [sic] long and way too hard? The most disingenuous person in politics\u2026 after Hillary,\u201d President Trump\u2019s oldest son tweeted, referring to his father\u2019s former White House opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know a joke if one raised you,\u201d Ms. Harris replied on Twitter.\n\nThe White House hopeful\u2019s retort was retweeted more than 57,000 times as of late the following morning.\n\nThe president\u2019s son responded by calling the candidate\u2019s presidential campaign a \u201cjoke\u201d on account of her lackluster performance in the polls as of late, though both of his tweets taking aim at Ms. Harris were comparably less well-received. His two quips were retweeted a combined total of about 13,000 times during roughly the same span.\n\nNationwide polling released by Fox News this week ranked Ms. Harris fifth among fellow Democratic presidential candidates, placing her behind current front-runners including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nEach of the candidates is among 12 participating in a Democratic presidential candidate primary debate taking place Tuesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
