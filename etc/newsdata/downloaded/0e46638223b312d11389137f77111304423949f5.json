Mr Netanyahu said that the pair had to form a government together.\n\n\u201cWith the help of God and with the help of the citizens of Israel, and with your help, the president\u2019s, we will form a broad, national unity government later on. I hope we succeed now,\u201d he said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Netanyahu\u2019s party won 32 seats.\n\nBut the incumbent prime minister secured the backing of more lawmakers than his rival, albeit with equally tight margins, with Mr Gantz securing 54 and Mr Netanyahu securing 55.\n\nThe question now is whether the prime minister will be able to form a coalition, or whether the deep divisions between Israel\u2019s political parties will force another election, which would be the third in just one year.\n\nThe president has impressed upon both sides that an election should be avoided at all costs, telling both men: \u201cPeople expect you to find a solution and to prevent further elections, even if it comes at a personal and even ideological cost.\u201d\n\nMr Gantz\u2019s party said that while they were \u201ccommitted to the principle of unity\u201d they could not enter into government if Mr Netanyahu is kept as leader, as he faces indictment in three corruption cases next month.\n\n\u201c[The party] treats the presidency with utmost respect and will accept any decision Rivlin makes. We come to the negotiating table with our principles, but also with an open mind and willful spirit\u201d, a statement from Blue and White party said.\n\nMr Gantz added: \u201cBlue and White, led by me, does not agree to sit in a government whose leader is facing a severe indictment. This issue, among a number of other critical factors, is more important to us than any delegation of ministerial posts or a rotation.\u201d\n\nMr Netanyahu, who has signed a deal with smaller allies including ultra-Orthodox parties, will struggle to form a coalition.\n\nFormer ally Avigdor Lieberman criticised Mr Netanyahu and urged him to be more flexible in talks. He won eight seats in the election but has so far refused to join either side.\n\nThe ex-defence minister and now head of the ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party had called for a secular unity government that excluded the prime minister\u2019s religious allies, a demand Mr Netanyahu has rejected.\n\n\u201cSince the 9 April election we\u2019ve seen Netanyahu\u2019s unlimited flexibility and stunts, from his \u2018Arabs are voting in droves\u2019 cries to the frantic negotiations with the Arab Joint List,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201dStop the blame game over who [would] be responsible for a third election \u2013 and perhaps we will heat the news, even before Rosh Hashanah, of a government, at least in principle.\u201d\n\nPresident Rivlin meanwhile added in his statement that he had offered several suggestions to help with the \u201clegal complications\u201d the country faced, in a veiled reference to Mr Netanyahu\u2019s likely court proceedings.\n\nHe suggested the appointment of an interim prime minister who would take over if the premier was \u201cunable to fulfil his role\u201d, it also added that the law could be amended to put a 100-day limit on the prime minister\u2019s leave of absence.\n\nTamara Wittes, senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings, told The Independent that the question will now be how strongly the various political parties will hold on to their campaign principles.\n\n\u201cLieberman said he will only join a unity government with the two major parties. Does he mean it, or might Netanyahu be able to entice him back into a right-wing coalition? Blue and White said they would not sit in a government with Likud headed by Netanyahu \u2014 will they really insist on his departure as the price of unity, even if it means a third election?\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cThe Likud MKs and all the parties to its right swore loyalty to Bibi as the head of their bloc. Do they mean it, or will they be willing to throw him over to avoid a third election? These are the questions.\n\n\u201cGantz seems to be banking on Lieberman holding his ground, meaning Bibi will fail to form a government of the right and will have to come to Gantz hat in hand. We shall see if that bet pays off.\u201d", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0has been tasked with forming a new Israeli government led by his right-wing\u00a0Likud\u00a0party after power-sharing talks reached a stalemate.
