Now\u2019s your chance with an auction of his possessions.", "language": "en", "text": "Anthony Bourdain was not a pack rat or a collector. His Manhattan apartment was not a museum dedicated to souvenirs gathered over the years when he served as host of \u201cParts Unknown\u201d and \u201cNo Reservations.\u201d His belongings were largely functional or decorative or educational. Few were items that you would immediately identify as keepsakes or mementos from his travels around the world.\n\nThat, at least, is one conclusion you could draw after reviewing the items from Bourdain\u2019s personal collection, which goes up for auction on Wednesday. The lot of more than 200 possessions includes bookshelves, a pocket watch, a chef\u2019s jacket, a cherry-wood sleigh bed, many pairs of sunglasses, a Kenneth Cole distressed leather jacket, a Tom Ford pinstripe suit, a cashmere coat, designer neckties, cookbooks, chef memoirs, art books, a Pottery Barn table with chairs and a filing cabinet with a top drawer that won\u2019t open.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t define him as a collector, someone who spends a lot of time and effort to get every issue of a comic book,\u201d said Laurie Woolever, co-author of Bourdain\u2019s \u201cAppetites: A Cookbook\u201d who for nearly a decade served as his assistant and gatekeeper. \u201cIt was more the things that interested him.\u201d\n\n\n\nA custom Bob Kramer steel-and-meteorite chef\u2019s knife is among the auction items. (Lark Mason Associates)\n\nBut it\u2019s important to remember, Woolever added, that the auction items came from Bourdain\u2019s small apartment, which he occupied from 2016 until his death in 2018. Woolever helped Bourdain pull his apartment together after he separated from his wife, Ottavia Busia, in 2016. Aside from the more functional pieces, like a desk or bed, the space was outfitted with the artwork, mementos or reading materials that were \u201cparticularly meaningful to him,\u201d Woolever said.\n\n[On the anniversary of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s birth, it\u2019s time we talk about depression]\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t everything that he owned, but it\u2019s everything that came with him to that smaller space,\u201d she added.\n\nThe true value of the possessions is hard to pin down with any precision. If you add up the lowest estimates on iGavel, the site where bidding will take place, the lots are worth around $54,200, based on appraisals by Lark Mason Associates, the auction house handling the sale. But the estimates, noted Woolever, are based on the market value of the possessions, not on any sentimental value that a buyer may attach to stuff once owned by Bourdain, a man whose fame reached around the world.\n\n\u201cI guess the value will be determined as the auction goes on,\u201d Woolever said. The auction ends Oct. 30.\n\nAmong the high-value lots is a custom-made Bob Kramer steel-and-meteorite chef\u2019s knife. It\u2019s worth between $4,000 and $6,000, according to the auction site. Woolever said the blade is one of the more sought-after items. The \u201cknife has the clearest through line to Tony being a former chef,\u201d she said.\n\nThere\u2019s also a Patek Philippe Calatrava 18-karat gold watch, with an estimated value between $5,000 and $8,000. Paintings by John Lurie, Duncan Hannah and Brad Phillips are expected to fetch thousands of dollars, too. But the more interesting lots may be those with little value on the free market but potentially tons of value to Bourdain fans: items such as Bourdain\u2019s chef\u2019s jacket, a stash of records, a Zippo lighter engraved with \u201cNo Reputations. Desert Special 2011,\u201d a customized U.S. Navy jacket from the USS Nashville (whose crew helped evacuate Bourdain and his team when they were caught in the middle of a battle in Beirut), four of Bourdain\u2019s college-era stories, a collection of Bourdain\u2019s comic books and many other personal belongings.\n\n\n\nUp for sale: a duck press from the Paris episode of \u201cThe Layover.\u201d (Lark Mason Associates)\n\nSome pieces have a history, and value, that may not be immediately grasped, such as the framed photo from pop star Billy Joel. During his time as a chef, Bourdain reportedly had a \u201cno Billy Joel rule\u201d on the sound system in his kitchens. Cooks who violated the rule could be fired on the spot. But that didn\u2019t stop Joel from sending Bourdain a small gift: a framed photo, along with a note that read, in part, \u201cSo much for your rule \u2014 \u2018No Billy Joel in my kitchen.\u2019 . . . By the way, I don\u2019t like the Grateful Dead either. Love, Billy Joel.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the writing desk. Its estimated value tops out at $1,200. But for the auction program and marketing materials, Woolever wrote a paragraph that may inspire bidders to fight over the piece:\n\nAs Bourdain spent so much time on the road, in hotels, airports, remote desert and jungle camps and the like, the comfort and beauty of his home was paramount. His home furnishings reflected a sense of nostalgia for the mid-century modern aesthetic of his 1950s and 1960s childhood, as well as his abiding love for the design sense employed by the Chateau Marmont, one of his favorite hotels, in West Hollywood. As such, the Peter Lovig Nielsen teak flip-top desk was the centerpiece of his home office. With its sleek but capacious design, it was the ideal hub for a writer who had seen the world and wanted to tell you about it.\n\nSixty percent of the auction\u2019s proceeds will go to Busia and the couple\u2019s daughter, Ariane. The remainder will fund the Anthony Bourdain Legacy Scholarship at the Culinary Institute of America, from which Bourdain graduated in 1978. The scholarship will assist CIA students who participate in one of the school\u2019s international or semester abroad programs. The school expects to award three Bourdain scholarships each year.\n\n[Anthony Bourdain was the best friend I never had]\n\n\u201cChef Bourdain traveled the world with humility, humanity, curiosity, and humor \u2014 traits we hope our students embrace,\u201d said Kevin Allan, CIA\u2019s vice president of advancement, in a statement.\n\nFor Woolever, working on the auction has been a bittersweet experience. She hasn\u2019t seen many of these objects since she worked with Bourdain. She said her boss had no misty-eyed notions about what happens after death. She thought he would be \u201cindifferent or supportive\u201d of the auction.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s benefiting a new generation of students at the CIA is somewhat comforting,\u201d Woolever added.\n\nBourdain\u2019s longtime assistant said she has little interest in bidding on an item. Turns out, she\u2019s not much of a collector, either. She already has plenty of keepsakes from her time with Bourdain: They\u2019re stored in memory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty well steeped in him,\u201d Woolever said. \u201cAn object to me doesn\u2019t have much appeal.\u201d\n\nRead more on Voraciously:\n\nA new survey about American breakfast preferences is stuck in the past\n\nOvi O\u2019s is a nod to an era when cold cereal was the \u2018breakfast of champions\u2019\n\nTo David Chang, the \u2018ethnic\u2019 food aisle is racist.
