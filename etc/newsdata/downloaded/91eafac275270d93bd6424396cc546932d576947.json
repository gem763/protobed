Elsewhere, you have to cook them yourself. They're not difficult to make and, if you like, you can double the batch and freeze the excess so you have them on hand for whenever you have a craving.\n\nIf you have a tortilla press, then use it to press the dough into circles. It works in the same way as the small press used to make dumpling wrappers, but it has a greater diameter. Without a tortilla press, you'll have to roll the dough into circles, using a small, short rolling pin.\n\n\n\nI tested this recipe several times, trying various types of curry powder and brands of canned sardines. It is essential to use a good, well-balanced curry powder so that no single spice dominates. For the sardines, don't bother buying the expensive ones from France or Spain, because once the fish is mixed with the other ingredients, you can't tell the difference in quality. Sardine cans come in different sizes, depending on the brand. For this recipe, the total weight of sardines, including the sauce, should be about 400 grams (14 oz). It's fine if it's a little more; the filling will just be slightly more pungent.", "description": "In Singapore and Malaysia curry puffs - fried pies filled with meat, seafood or vegetables - are sold at fast-food shops, bakeries and kopitiam (a traditional\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_cooking/public/d8/images/2019/10/18/mer59391363.jpg?itok=jFL4E5HL", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
