(iStock)\n\nDoctors striking in Zimbabwe for pay hikes defied a government order to resume work on Monday and asked the UN and private businesses to help fund their return to the wards.\n\nThe doctors are in the second month of a strike over salaries which have dwindled to less than $100 per month in some cases as a result of galloping inflation.\n\nThey say their pay has lost value by at least 1 500 percent.\n\nIn a statement, the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA) said they have used up their savings by \"subsidising the employer\" for them to just report for work.\n\nNegotiations with the government have been deadlocked as the doctors rejected a 60 percent pay increase and demanded their salaries be pegged to the US dollar.\n\nHealth Minister Obadiah Moyo at the weekend ordered the medics to return to work, warning them with unspecified disciplinary action if they did not comply.\n\nThe government has adopted a ham-fisted response to the strike, now in its 34th day.\n\nLast month police tried to stop the doctors from marching to parliament, until a court allowed the protest.\n\nThe leader of the doctors' union Peter Magombeyi was last month abducted by suspected state agents, only to be released five days later after pressure from his colleagues.\n\nThe government tried to block him from travelling to neighbouring South Africa for treatment after local doctors recommended further medical assessment.\n\nHe was only allowed to leave following another court order.\n\nThe striking doctors have appealed to the World Health Organization (WHO), local businesses, churches and NGOs to help raise funding to supplement their wages.\n\n\"Lives are being lost and there is need to urgently raise resources to supplement... the salaries of 1 800 government-employed doctors,\" they said.\n\nShould the UN heed the doctors' call, it will not be the first time it has supported health personnel in the crisis-ridden country.\n\nUNICEF ran a so-called Health Transition Fund, a multi-donor pooled fund for four years from 2011, paying out allowances to augment medical practitioners' salaries.", "description": "Doctors striking in Zimbabwe for pay hikes defied a government order to resume work on Monday and asked the UN and private businesses to help fund their return to the wards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/18e7dc79ce7c4212ba195be718d868a6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
