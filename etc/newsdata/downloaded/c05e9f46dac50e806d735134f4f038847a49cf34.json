I am very displeased about it.\u201d Speaking outside the North Korean Embassy, he read a statement in Korean that a translator next to him read in English.\n\nKim said negotiations broke down \u201centirely because the U.S. has not discarded its old stance and attitude.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s talks were the first between the U.S. and North Korea since the February breakdown of the second summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Vietnam.\n\nNorth Korea has since resumed missile tests, including an underwater-launched missile that fell inside Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone Wednesday.\n\nState Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said Kim\u2019s comments did \u201cnot reflect the content or the spirit\u201d of the \u201cgood discussions\u201d that took place over eight-and-a-half hours, adding that the U.S. accepted an invitation from Sweden to return to Stockholm in two weeks to continue discussions.\n\nIn a statement, Ortagus said the U.S. delegation \u201cpreviewed a number of new initiatives that would allow us to make progress in each of the four pillars\u201d of a joint statement issued after Trump and Kim\u2019s first summit in Singapore.\n\n\u201cThe United States and the DPRK will not overcome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula through the course of a single Saturday,\u201d Ortagus said\n\nTalks were held at the Villa Elfvik Strand conference facility in Lidingo, an island in the Stockholm archipelago located northeast of the capital, Swedish news agency TT said. It added that Kim Miyong Gil arrived on Thursday while U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun came on Friday.\n\nBecause the U.S. does not have official diplomatic relations with North Korea, Sweden has often acted as a bridge between Washington and Pyongyang.\n\n___\n\nMatthew Lee reported from Athens, Greece.", "description": "HELSINKI (AP) \u2014 North Korea's chief negotiator said Saturday that discussions with the U.S. on Pyongyang's nuclear program have broken down, but", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/05/6f29e3_north-korea-us-talks-35245-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-file-in-30-2019-file-photo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
