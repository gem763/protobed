Reporters spoke to one family that had moved into their rebuilt home on Saturday, only to be immediately evacuated again.\n\nThe spectacle was cinematic: at one point, fire jumped the Carquinez Strait at the end of San Francisco Bay, shrouding the bridge on Interstate 80 in smoke and flame.\n\nEven areas that didn\u2019t actually burn felt the effects: Pacific Gas and Electric turned off power to millions, fearful that when the wind tore down its wires they would spark new conflagrations.\n\nThree years in a row feels like \u2013 well, it starts to feel like the new, and impossible, normal. That\u2019s what the local newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, implied this morning when, in the middle of its account of the inferno, it included the following sentence: the fires had \u201cintensified fears that parts of California had become almost too dangerous to inhabit\u201d. Read that again: the local paper is on record stating that part of the state is now so risky that its citizens might have to leave.\n\nOn the one hand, this comes as no real surprise. My most recent book, Falter, centered on the notion that the climate crisis was making large swaths of the world increasingly off-limits to humans. Cities in Asia and the Middle East where the temperature now reaches the upper 120s \u2013 levels so high that the human body can\u2019t really cool itself; island nations (and Florida beaches) where each high tide washes through the living room or the streets; Arctic villages relocating because, with sea ice vanished, the ocean erodes the shore.\n\nBut California? California was always the world\u2019s idea of paradise (until perhaps the city of that name burned last summer). Hollywood shaped our fantasies of the last century, and many of its movies were set in the Golden state. It\u2019s where the Okies trudged when their climate turned vicious during the Dust Bowl years \u2013 \u201cpastures of plenty\u201d, Woody Guthrie called the green agricultural valleys. John Muir invented our grammar and rhetoric of wildness in the high Sierra (and modern environmentalism was born with the club he founded).\n\nCalifornia is the Golden state, the land of ease. I was born there, and though I left young enough that my memories are suspect, I grew up listening to my parents\u2019 stories. They had been newlyweds in the late 50s, living a block from the ocean in Manhattan Beach; when they got home from work they could walk to the sand for a game of volleyball. Date night was a mile or two up the Pacific Coast Highway to the Lighthouse, the jazz club where giants such as Gerry Mulligan showed up regularly, inventing the cool jazz that defined the place and time. Sunset magazine showcased a California aesthetic as breezy and informal as any on earth: the redwood deck, the cedar-shake roof, the suburban idyll among the eucalyptus and the pine. That is to say, precisely the kinds of homes that today are small piles of ash with only the kidney-shaped pool intact.\n\nTruth be told, that California began to vanish fairly quickly, as orange groves turned into airplane factories and then tech meccas. The great voices of California in recent years \u2013 writers such as Mike Davis and Rebecca Solnit \u2013 chronicle the demise of much that was once idyllic in a wave of money, consumption, nimbyism, tax dodging, and corporate greed. The state\u2019s been booming in recent years \u2013 it\u2019s the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy, bigger than the UK \u2013 but it\u2019s also home to tent encampments of homeless people with no chance of paying rent. And it\u2019s not just climate change that\u2019s at fault: California has always had fires, and the state\u2019s biggest utility, PG&E, is at this point as much an arsonist as electricity provider.\n\nStill, it takes a force as great as the climate crisis to really \u2013 perhaps finally \u2013 tarnish Eden. In the last decade, the state has endured the deepest droughts ever measured, dry spells so intense that more than a hundred million trees died. A hundred million \u2013 and the scientists who counted them warned that their carcasses could \u201cproduce wildfires on a scale and of an intensity that California has never seen\u201d. The drought has alternated with record downpours that have turned burned-over stretches into massive house-burying mudslides.\n\nAnd so Californians \u2013 always shirtsleeved and cool \u2013 spend some of the year in face masks and much of it with a feeling of trepidation.
