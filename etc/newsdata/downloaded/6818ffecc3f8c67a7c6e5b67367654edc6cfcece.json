Don\u2019t wait to live on your terms.\n\nJenn Gottlieb. Courtesy of The Oracles\n\nBefore becoming an entrepreneur, I moved to New York to fulfill my dream of being an actor. I took the starving artist approach that you're \"supposed\" to do, accepting any role for any amount of money, even if it meant selling my soul. I thought being miserable, broke, and objectified was the only way. I landed an awesome role co-hosting a VH1 show, but I was portraying myself as someone who couldn't have been more inauthentic to who I truly was. When the show was cancelled, I was forced to take a hard look at my life. I knew there had to be a way to fulfill my passion in a manner that helped others. I wanted to bring more to the world and was done waiting for opportunities and approval.\n\nI decided to reinvent what success looked like for me, not anyone else. I went against the grain and was true to who I wanted to be. It was scary and uncomfortable, but I created a life and career beyond my wildest dreams. Now I get to perform, innovate, and help people \u2014 and I'm paid well. Be true to who you are, even if it means going against pressure from others, and the opportunities, relationships, and money will flow!\n\n\u2014 Jen Gottlieb, co-founder and chief mindset officer at Super Connector Media and host of Unfair Advantage live, a premier publicity event connecting entrepreneurs to the media; follow Jen on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram", "description": "Don't just grind away at something you're not passionate about when your gut is telling you to go another direction.", "authors": ["The Oracles"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5ccb5db4021b4c0df7622c38?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
