In other words, if just a small percentage of them turn on the president, he\u2019ll lose the key state.\n\nAccording to data cited by Axios, more than 4 million people in swing states were regular vapers in 2016, and that number has only increased since then.\n\nJudging from the reaction on Twitter TWTR, +0.70% from the likes of \u201cMatt From SMM,\u201d many of them could be single-issue voters in 2020:\n\nFDA could have quietly screwed us but now that the President has put his name on this flavor ban, he owns it.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t like banning other tobacco products. Vapers are a tight-knit (and large) community that will fight against anyone trying to take their lifestyle away. \u2014 Matt From SMM (@SuckMyMod) September 22, 2019\n\nRead: Walmart to stop selling all e-cigarettes", "description": "In key battleground states, vapers could make all the difference.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX420_juul_1_ZG_20181031135507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
