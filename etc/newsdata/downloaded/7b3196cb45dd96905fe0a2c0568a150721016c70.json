George Washington and Benjamin Franklin were among some leaders who believed history was the most important subject to undertake. While they said it in a political context so that past political mistakes are not repeated, history can help us live more sustainably in the present.\n\nA few thousand years ago before the onset of the industrial revolution that emphasised on mass production in the cheapest manner possible, people used to live in conjunction with their immediate environment.Indian architecture was a prime example of drawing from nature to create shelter. People used to live in hot and humid India without air conditioners that infect the environment with toxic chlorofluorocarbons.\n\nlizcleere\n\nWe are now living in the Anthropocene Era, where human beings are impacting and altering the environment much more than other species. Growing consciousness of the reality of climate change (despite what US President Donald Trump might say), there is implicit pressure to mend our way before it\u2019s too late.\n\nThere are many lessons that can be learnt from our recent ancestors on living in harmony with the environment and we needn\u2019t look too far in the past to learn how to. Indian architecture used to employ techniques that can be applied today as well.\n\nDon't Miss 14 K SHARES 16.2 K SHARES 11.2 K SHARES 4.7 K SHARES 3 K SHARES\n\nManit Rastogi, Architect and co-Founder of Morphogenesis, who designed Pearl Academy of Fashion in Jaipur using a number of old techniques said there is the misconception that green means expensive. But he said it is possible to create sustainable buildings that are cheaper to build and run.\n\nHere are five techniques that Indian architecture used in the past:\n\n1. Jharokhas\n\nBCCL/Indiatimes\n\nHawa Mahal in Jaipur is called so because it houses 953 windows, known as jharokhas that maintain air ventilation and so keep temperatures low. Creating small perforations in the building is a smart way to naturally cool buildings in a hot and humid country like India.\n\n2. Roshandan\n\nIndian forums\n\nRoshandan was a key feature of many houses in the northern part of India, which both ventilated air and let light in. They are usually located on the high-end of the ceiling wall or on top of windows. Their location was important because they let hot air close to the ceiling escape while maintaining cooler air inside and below. In winter, roshandans would be closed and used as skylights.\n\n3. Jaali\n\nPinterest\n\nA rough translation of Jaali would be 'net' and is an architectural technique that uses natural/environmental dynamics to create comfort. Jaali is small perforations in a wall that eliminates direct sunlight and also maintains a constant movement of air. Also, it lets light in without glare and so the intensity of light remains unaffected. Jaali effectively applies the Bernoulli and Venturi laws, which says that the speed of air increases when it passes through smaller holes. So even if there is mild wind outside, Jaali still manages to create an intense effect inside.\n\n4. Baori\n\nAviott\n\nStepwell is a vernacular architectural style used commonly in medieval India. A pool of water dug into the ground or surrounded by walls so that the air is constantly cooled by water evaporating in an enclosed, shaded area.\n\n5. High ceilings\n\nThe logic with high ceilings is that hot air rises and escapes from ventilators, automatically creating a cooling effect.\n\nIn the quest for urbanisation, Indian cities have erected buildings that go against its immediate surroundings. A hot and humid sub-continent does not need glass buildings, which are better suited for cooler environments. Urban planners and architects should take a lesson or two from Indian history to create cities and buildings that are not only better suited for its environment, but also help in sustainable living.\n\nCover image is by Better Photography and for representational purposes only.", "description": "Here are five techniques that Indian architecture used in the past that can be used today for sustainable living.
