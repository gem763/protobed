REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco\n\nU.S. S&P500 mini futures ESc1 traded down 0.1%, with a big part of early losses cut after the New York Times reported Washington will soon issue licenses allowing some U.S. firms to supply non-sensitive goods to China\u2019s Huawei Technologies.\n\nAnother report, from Bloomberg, that the White House is looking at rolling out a previously agreed currency pact with China, also raised hopes of a partial deal and helped to lift risk assets.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS gained 0.24% while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.34%. Shanghai shares .SSEC also rose 0.49%.\n\nEuropean stocks are on course to open higher, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures STXEc1 rising 0.17% in Asian trade.\n\nEarlier U.S. stock futures slumped as much as 1.3%, as the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported the Chinese delegation, headed by Vice Premier Liu He, was planning to leave Washington after just a day of minister-level meetings, instead of as originally planned on Friday.\n\nTop negotiators from the two countries were scheduled to meet in Washington on Thursday and Friday to try to end a bruising 15-month-old trade war.\n\nThough there were some conflicting reports on whether Liu\u2019s plans have been changed, many market players remained cautious.\n\nWithout significant progress, U.S. President Donald Trump is set to hike the tariff rate on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% next Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBarring any surprise today, it looks like their talk is breaking down. The tariff will be hiked. The situation looks dire,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\nChina is unlikely to be willing to make an easy compromise with a U.S. president who seems increasingly vulnerable to domestic political pressure as opposition Democrats seek to impeach him, analysts also said.\n\nU.S. Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden called for the impeachment of Trump for the first time in a deepening partisan fight over a congressional investigation of the Republican president.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s recent impeachment risk has turned the timetable against him, Chi Lo, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset in Hong Kong, wrote in a report to clients.\n\n\u201cWhile China is not eager to reach a trade deal, Mr. Trump is, however, under pressure to get at least a temporary deal done to help his re-election bid before his impeachment risk rises and the U.S. economy weakens further,\u201d Chi said.\n\nIn the currency market, the offshore yuan reversed early losses to gain 0.3% to trade at 7.1148 per dollar CNH= following the Bloomberg report about a U.S.-China currency pact.\n\n\u201cThe yuan rose on expectations of a currency pact. If there will be such an agreement, the yuan could rise to 6.9 to the dollar. But the trouble is, no one knows what\u2019s in that pact that they had reportedly agreed in February,\u201d said Ei Kaku, currency strategist at Nomura Securities.\n\nIn the onshore trade, the renminbi gained 0.25% to 7.1130 CNY=CFXS.\n\nThe safe haven yen and Swiss franc gave up most of their early gains.\n\nThe yen last stood almost flat at 107.56 JPY= while the Swiss franc traded at 0.9946 franc per dollar CHF=, about 0.1% higher than late U.S. levels. The euro firmed slightly to $1.0986 EUR=.\n\nSterling wobbled near one-month lows against the dollar and the euro as hopes of a break-through on a key sticking point for a Brexit deal were dashed.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, a coalition partner in the British government, said it would emphatically oppose a reported European Union concession on the Irish backstop under any Brexit deal.\n\nThe pound last stood at $1.2227 GBP=D4, up 0.2% for the day but still not far from Tuesday's five-week low of $1.2196.\n\nThe Turkish lira retreated to six-week lows as Turkish troops, together with their Syrian rebel allies, attacked Kurdish militia in northeast Syria, opening a fresh chapter in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old civil war.\n\nThe lira fell to 5.8777 per dollar TRYTOM=D4, the lowest since its flash crash on Aug. 26.\n\nU.S. Treasuries yield slipped back after having risen to 1.594% on Wednesday, pressured partly by this week\u2019s heavy bond supply.\n\nThe 10-year Treasuries yield dipped to one basis point to 1.577% US10YT=RR.\n\nThe price of front-end Fed funds rate futures gained on increasing bets on more rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nThe November contract FFX9 is almost fully pricing in a 0.25 percentage point cut on Oct. 30.\n\nOil prices also slid on wariness over U.S.-China talks. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 0.15% to $58.23 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 lost 0.11% to $52.53 per barrel.", "description": "Global stocks recouped early losses as news reports raised hopes that the United States and China would settle some economic disputes, but investors were kept on edge by an earlier report that trade talks due to begin on Thursday could be cut short.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439093716&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9826H", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
