The repo market is where hedge funds and banks lend funds in return for collateral such as Treasurys or government-sponsored mortgage bonds.\n\nThe surge in repo rates briefly tugged the central bank\u2019s benchmark interest rate above its preferred range, raising questions as to whether the Fed was losing its grip on monetary policy.\n\nWilliams said the central bank had anticipated some strains, but that \u201cthe size of the reaction in the repo markets were well outside the range of recent experience.\u201d\n\nHe made his comments while speaking at the Managed Funds Association\u2019s annual meeting in New York, where he later held a question-and-answer session with the media.\n\nWilliams underlined how the Federal Reserve had decided to increase its balance sheet under careful consideration, arguing that the bills market was large enough to accommodate its plans.\n\nInvestors and analysts have raised worries that the U.S. central bank will struggle to source sufficient bills from banks and investors.\n\nWilliams said the central bank could still tweak \u201ctechnical details,\u201d suggesting this could include buying short-dated coupon-bearing securities later.\n\nRead: New York Fed president defends his bank from criticism over the way it handled turmoil in money market\n\nWilliams said that one of the tools that would come under evaluation was a permanent lending facility allowing repo-market participants to readily borrow funds from the New York Fed. However, he said it was more important for the Fed to boost the level of reserves circulating in the financial system via the expansion of the central bank\u2019s balance sheet.\n\n\u201cRepos do add reserves, but it doesn\u2019t act as a substitute to have a higher level of reserves permanently,\u201d he said.\n\nExecutives at Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs GS, -0.46% and JP Morgan JPM, +0.56% , which play a large role in money markets, have recently cited liquidity and capital requirements \u2014 designed to ensure banks have sufficient reserves \u2014 for preventing them from lending out funds as they might have before the financial crisis.\n\nWilliams said the central bank\u2019s moves to boost the level of reserves through the increase of its $3.6 trillion portfolio would take into account such \u201cunintended consequences\u201d regardless, and that the capital requirements were \u201cthere for a reason,\u201d citing the soundness of the biggest U.S. banks.\n\n\u201cWe want the leadership of the biggest banks to be strong risk managers,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the economy, Williams said though he took heart in strong consumer spending data, he said it was not a leading indicator and therefore should play a less of a role in determining the need for further interest-rate decisions.\n\nThe head of the New York Fed said he would pay close attention to the trade and geopolitical uncertainty clouding the global economy.\n\n\u201cMy concern is if we see a broader slowdown in the economy, in business investment, manufacturing, this would start to hurt jobs and the earnings of households, and start to hurt the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nRead: Fed\u2019s Williams, downplaying recession fears, says \u2018outlook very favorable\u2019\n\nStocks ended slightly higher on Thursday.
