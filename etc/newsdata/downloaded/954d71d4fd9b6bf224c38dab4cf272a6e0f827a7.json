Col. Alexander Vindman, saying the fact he was born in Ukraine may have been a factor in his decision to report concerns about President Trump\u2019s July telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe former Wisconsin GOP congressman appeared on CNN\u2019s New Day hours before Vindman is set to become the first sitting White House official to testify in the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. Vindman is the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council and is expected to tell House investigators that he was so alarmed by what he heard on Trump\u2019s call to Zelensky that he felt obliged to reported it to one of his superiors.\n\nVindman\u2014and his twin, who also works for the NSC\u2014was born in Ukraine but left for the U.S. when they were 3 years old, according to a profile of him published by The New York Times on Tuesday. That fact raised alarmed for Duffy, who appears to have doubts over whether Vindman had America\u2019s best interests in mind when reporting the call.\n\n\u201cIt seems very clear that [Vindman] is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about his concern [for] American policy, but his main mission was to make sure the Ukraine got those weapons. I understand it: We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from. Like me, I\u2019m sure that Vindman has the same affinity.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would put the defense of his ancestral homeland of Ireland ahead of America\u2019s, Duffy ignored the question and said: \u201cHe\u2019s entitled to his opinion, he has an affinity, I think, for the Ukraine, he speaks Ukrainian, he came from the country, and he wants to make sure they\u2019re safe and free.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI understand that, but my point is the president is the one who gets to set the policy and he\u2019s the one that looks out for America first, and the American taxpayer, and American citizens.\u201d\n\nDuffy stepped down from Congress this fall, citing the health needs of one of his children. The former MTV Real World participant was hired by CNN as a commentator this month.\n\nDuffy then failed to answer whether he believed that Vindman, a decorated war hero who earned a Purple Heart in Iraq, was looking out for America over the country of his birth.\n\nDuffy\u2019s comments echoed those made by Fox News host Laura Ingraham and two of her guests Monday night, when they suggested that Vindman is guilty of \u201cespionage\u201d and could be a Ukrainian double agent. During a panel discussion on The Ingraham Angle, Ingraham said she found it unusual that Vindman occasionally spoke to Ukrainian officials in their language.\n\nThe Fox News host said: \u201cHere we have a U.S. national-security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest, and usually, they spoke in English. Isn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d\n\nFormer Bush administration official John Yoo, who was appearing on the show as a guest, then added: \u201cYou know, some people might call that espionage.\u201d", "description": "The new CNN hire expressed doubts over whether the wounded Iraq War vet had America's interests in mind when he raised flags over Trump\u2019s call.", "authors": ["Jamie Ross"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_804,w_1430,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572352096/Screen_Shot_2019-10-29_at_12.27.47_jwqdgv", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
