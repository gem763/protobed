(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nWashington Redskins right tackle Morgan Moses wasn\u2019t happy with the decision to make running back Adrian Peterson a healthy scratch on Sunday, and said he plans to say something to the Redskins\u2019 coaching staff to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\n\u201cAny time you\u2019ve got a Hall of Fame guy that doesn\u2019t dress, man, it\u2019s a slap in the face,\u201d Morgan told the Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan on Monday, when asked if Peterson would have helped a Redskins running game that produced a measly 28 yards in a season-opening loss to the Eagles. \u201c \u2026 It\u2019s my job as one of the older guys on the offensive line to speak up and say, \u2018Hey, we need him.' Obviously, you don\u2019t put a Hall of Fame guy like that on the sideline, and when he\u2019s healthy, as well. I think he brings a lot to the game. I think he brings a lot to our team. But to have that guy just standing on the sideline is just, it doesn\u2019t sit well to guys on the team or the NFL.\"\n\n[Inside the four drives that doomed the Redskins in their loss to the Eagles]\n\nShortly after the news broke that Peterson would be a healthy inactive for the first time in his career on Sunday morning, reports emerged that the decision hadn\u2019t gone over well with Peterson\u2019s teammates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a couple people earlier in the week, and even today, and they\u2019re not happy about this,\u201d former Redskins linebacker and CBS Sports Network analyst London Fletcher said on \u201cThat Other Pregame Show.\u201d \u201cNot everyone is on board with Adrian Peterson not playing in this ballgame. \u2026 It\u2019s affecting that locker room. I just don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nMoses first expressed his displeasure with the decision to reporters after the Redskins rushed for their fewest yards in a season opener since 1965.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have too many walking Hall of Famers on your football team,\u201d Moses said Sunday. \u201c \u2026 Obviously, we think he\u2019s a hell of a football player. He has a hell of a lot of juice left. Hopefully, it\u2019s just a one-week thing and we can move forward.\u201d\n\nGruden\u2019s decision to sit Peterson in favor of running backs Derrius Guice, Chris Thompson and Wendell Smallwood was based in part on his desire to have another player who could contribute on special teams active, which Smallwood provided. Gruden also suggested there weren\u2019t enough carries to go around between Guice, who missed all of last season with a torn ACL, and Peterson, who rushed for 1,042 yards in 2018.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a first- and second-down back,\u201d Gruden said of Peterson after the game. \u201cSo is Derrius. So, really, what do we have? About 20 first downs a game. Probably eight of those are passes, 12 of those might be runs, and Derrius can handle those 12. So if we have a game where we think we can run the ball 55 times in a game in an I-formation, then sure, I\u2019ll get him up.\u201d\n\nGruden said the decision of whether to activate Peterson will be \u201cweek-to-week,\u201d while Moses said he will be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if Peterson is inactive for Washington\u2019s home opener against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWith Guice coming off the injury and him having his first action, a lot of us felt like Adrian should have been out there, even if it was just to spare Guice,\u201d Moses said. \u201c \u2026 I know I\u2019m not the only person that feels that way, but we gotta correct some things.\u201d\n\nFellow running back Chris Thompson said he also \u201cwanted AP to be out there\u201d against the Eagles, but understood the coaching staff\u2019s need to consider special teams when deciding on its list of inactives.\n\n\u201cI was excited, too, just possibly being a three-headed monster out there, being able to come in after he and Guice had pounded on the defense,\u201d Thompson, who rushed for 10 yards on three carries, said Monday on 106.7 The Fan. \u201c \u2026 I don\u2019t know if he makes a difference [Sunday] or not, but we\u2019d still like to see him.\u201d\n\nPenalties didn\u2019t help the Redskins\u2019 running game against the Eagles. Moses, who led the NFL in accepted penalties last season and committed two of Washington\u2019s 12 penalties on Sunday, criticized the officiating after the game and suggested the referees had it out for the Redskins. He repeated that opinion on Monday, but added that penalties weren\u2019t the reason Washington lost.\n\n\u201cI might be stretching this a little bit \u2026 but there\u2019s no question that we\u2019ve been targeted throughout the NFL these last couple of seasons on penalties,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do our best to play by the rules, but sometimes these holding calls, they\u2019re just outrageous. Obviously, these referees have never played a lick of football in their life, and for some reason they think it\u2019s holding. When you\u2019ve got your hands inside the breastplate, or if you\u2019re running and diving at somebody, there\u2019s no way that can be a hold. \u2026 It\u2019s a little outrageous, but you gotta figure out a way to get around it.\u201d\n\nWashington committed the seventh-most penalties in the NFL last season and the fifth-fewest in 2017.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nEagles fans show more fight than Redskins in season opener\n\nWith Adrian Peterson, Redskins have two options: Play him or set him free\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 season opener was a lot of things.
