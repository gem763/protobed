Next up is the winless New York Jets this weekend.\n\nThe Jets are a 22-point underdog against the defending champions and will start third-stringer Luke Falk at quarterback in Foxborough.\n\nFor the second consecutive week, New England received 11 of the 12 first-place votes for 383 points in balloting Tuesday by media members who regularly cover the NFL.\n\n\u201cBill Belichick shows no mercy on former Patriots defensive coordinator Brian Flores against the Dolphins, and the New England machine rolls on,\u201d Newsday\u2019s Bob Glauber said. \u201cThere\u2019s already talk of an unbeaten season, a testament to how well they\u2019re playing.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs stayed at No. 2, collecting the remaining first-place vote and 368 points.\n\nThe Chiefs host the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday in one of the top matchups of Week 3. The Ravens, off to a 2-0 start, jumped three places to No. 5.\n\n\u201cThe league\u2019s No. 2 defense faces quite a challenge Sunday at Arrowhead, where Patrick Mahomes is waiting,\u201d said Ira Kaufman of Fox 13 in Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams moved up a spot to No. 3 after routing the New Orleans Saints 27-9 in a rematch of last season\u2019s NFC championship game. The Saints, who will be without quarterback Drew Brees for the next six to eight weeks with a torn ligament in his throwing thumb, fell seven spots to No. 10.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic about the Saints in Brees\u2019 absence,\u201d said Alex Marvez of Sirius XM.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys, Seattle Seahawks and Green Bay Packers, three NFC teams off to 2-0 starts, all made solid climbs in the poll.\n\nThe Cowboys moved up two spots to No. 4, and the Seahawks and Packers each jumped four places to Nos. 6 and 7, respectively.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings, each coming off close losses, lost some ground. The Eagles fell three spots to No. 8 after Sunday night\u2019s loss to Atlanta, and the Vikings dropped two places to No. 9.\n\n\u201cThat loss all on (Kirk) Cousins,\u201d Fox Sports\u2019 John Czarnecki said of the Vikings quarterback who was 14 for 32 for 230 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions in Minnesota\u2019s 21-16 loss to Green Bay.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New England Patriots are one of nine 2-0 teams in the NFL.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Simmi Buttar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/patriots_dolphins_football_28192_c0-181-4330-2705_s1770x1032.jpg?c078252a3efe1e1a90d0455179aa63a2b419a9c6", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
