Taylor misplayed a line drive to center a half-inning later, allowing what could have been the tying run to score. Instead, the cushion afforded by Eaton held up and helped expand the Nationals\u2019 lead \u2014 putting them two wins away from their first World Series appearance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBiggest hit of the year so far,\u201d shortstop Trea Turner said.\n\nAD\n\nThe pivotal double came one day after he delivered the other most important insurance run of the season. In Friday night\u2019s Game 1, Eaton smacked a triple to left-center field and later scored on a Howie Kendrick single to give the Nationals breathing room in a 2-0 win. The hit in Game 2 somehow seemed even more surprising because the Cardinals\u2019 starter, Adam Wainwright, had befuddled Eaton all afternoon.\n\nThe right-hander mixed pitches, locations and speeds against the veteran outfielder. Eaton flied out to left field in the first inning on Wainwright\u2019s signature 12-to-6 curveball. He grounded out meekly in the third on a sinker off the plate. He struck out looking in the sixth when Wainwright started outside with a curveball and a fastball and then came back in with another sinker.\n\nAD\n\nThe shadows in Busch Stadium for the afternoon game didn\u2019t help. When the ball leaves the pitcher\u2019s hand, the hitter looks at the seams, and the direction of the spin usually tells him what type of pitch it is. Shadows sometimes make the ball appear gray and cloud the seams. Eaton pointed out that Kolten Wong, the Cardinals\u2019 second baseman, check-swung twice and barreled up what became two groundouts.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou just saw some really bad swings and bad counts [for everyone],\u201d Eaton said.\n\nWainwright had allowed four hits and one run in seven innings when he faced Eaton again in the eighth. Matt Adams and Turner had singled, so Eaton had two on and one out. It seemed possible that, with traffic and Wainwright nearing 100 pitches, Manager Mike Shildt might go to left-hander Andrew Miller. But Shildt stayed in the dugout.\n\nAD\n\nEaton wasn\u2019t contemplating whether he would face Miller or Wainwright. He believes considering what a manager might do distracts from the focus of getting a hit against the man on the mound. He needed to concentrate because Wainwright and catcher Yadier Molina had confused him all day, keeping him \u201creally, really off balance.\u201d\n\nThe sun had gone down, meaning he was seeing the ball all the way to the plate for the first time. Eaton did what he has done best for this team all season and wore down the pitcher. He laid off \u00adcurveballs that just missed up and away and coaxed Wainwright back inside. He fouled off a fastball that would\u2019ve been strike three and got the count to 3-2.\n\nAD\n\nEaton thought whatever Wainwright threw, he needed to throw it for a strike. He decided it should be a fastball, but then he stopped himself. He thought of George Costanza, the sitcom character from \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d The short, stocky, \u00adfollicly challenged man decided, at one point in the show, to disregard his instincts and do the opposite. Eaton channeled his inner Costanza: He forgot the fastball and geared up for the curve. He felt an unmatched conviction \u201cmore so than any other pitch \u2014 or any other at-bat that I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cGeorge was right.\u201d\n\nEaton poked the curveball just fair inside first base and sprinted to second base as Adams and Turner scored. Shildt marched out of the dugout to replace Wainwright. In the end, Adam knocked in Adams (and Turner) as he knocked an Adam out.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "Outfielder goes against his instincts, channels his inner George Constanza to produce two-run double to give Nats some breathing room to take 2-0 lead in NLCS.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/o73I-MJgPvIEB8UpKcXGSY61K98=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4JWJH4XNMAI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
