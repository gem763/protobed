I\u2019d been coming off a few years of difficulty, and I was not feeling very strong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In fact, I was feeling pretty broken. It took me a moment to feel the strength of [Maleficent] again.\u2019\n\nIt was recently reported that Angelina and Brad, 55, are struggling to reach a financial settlement in their divorce and have asked a judge to give them more time.\n\nAnge and Brad split in 2016 (Picture: WireImage)\n\nAccording to The Blast, Brad filed legal documents asking for the appointment of a privately compensated temporary judge in order to continue their discussion.\n\nThe request was approved by Angelina and later the LA County Court.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Tomb Raider actress has spoken of the aftermath of her split from Brad.\n\nShe recently said: \u2018I don\u2019t know what my fate holds but what I am convinced of is that I am in a period of transition, like a return to my roots, a return to myself. Because, I had lost myself a bit.\u2019\n\nAngelina tried to involve her children in the Maleficent experience this time round but, sadly, none of them were interested in getting camera time.\n\n\u2018I tried. Viv still can\u2019t believe I made her a princess. None of my kids want to be actors. [They\u2019re into] business, humanitarian affairs, things like that. Nobody was interested!\u2019 Ange told the publication.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
