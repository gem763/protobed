The teams combined for 12 runs on 11 hits, including three home runs, in the ninth inning. Javy Guerra (3-1) got the win by getting the final out in the top of the inning.\n\nWashington has won five of its last six and 10 of 12, winning on the biggest comeback in the bottom of the ninth inning in franchise history.
