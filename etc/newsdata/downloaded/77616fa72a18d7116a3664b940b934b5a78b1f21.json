But he ruled out any direct contacts with Damascus \"at this point\".\n\n\"We have no dealings with the regime at this point. We do this through the Russians,\" he said. The deal with the US and an agreement to be made with Russia would help the political process, he added.\n\n\"That is all in the interest of reducing violence.\"\n\nThe prospect of thousands of Islamic State group jihadists escaping in the chaos after Turkey launched its military action on October 9 has caused widespread alarm in the West.\n\nKalin accused Kurdish forces of using IS prisoners as a \"bargaining chip in this dirty war\" by deliberately freeing them. It was a \"blackmail basically to garner support from the West\", he said.\n\nTurkish forces and their proxies had captured 196 IS prisoners in Syria on Friday, and they were being locked in a \"safe place\" in Syria.\n\n\"They are under arrest, they are in a safe place. They are locked up. As our president has said before we will not let these people loose.\"", "description": "Turkey on Saturday urged the United States to use its \"leverage\" over Syrian Kurdish forces to ensure an orderly pullout under an agreement reached with Washington, a presidential spokesman told AFP.
