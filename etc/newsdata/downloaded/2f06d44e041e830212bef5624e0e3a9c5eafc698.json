In those days, most of the jokes he pitched were deemed too dark for the sunny host.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really want my sensibility,\u201d Jeselnik says on this week\u2019s episode of The Last Laugh podcast. He ended up staying for a year and leaving of his own volition. He was long gone by the time Fallon ruffled Donald Trump\u2019s hair on The Tonight Show and subsequently got blamed for \u201cnormalizing\u201d the candidate just a few weeks before the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI felt a little bad for Jimmy in that situation,\u201d Jeselnik admits. But he doesn\u2019t blame Fallon.\n\n\u201cTrump and Lorne Michaels are friends. And Lorne Michaels produced that show,\u201d Jeselnik says of The Tonight Show. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure\u2014and I don\u2019t want to put words in his mouth, and I haven\u2019t talked to Jimmy in years\u2014but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s one of his biggest regrets.\u201d\n\nIn an interview last year, Fallon said that he never intended to \u201cnormalize\u201d Trump and felt \u201cdepressed\u201d amidst all of the backlash. \u201c I made a mistake,\u201d he added. \u201cI'm sorry if I made anyone mad. And, looking back, I would do it differently.\u201d\n\nFallon likely did not think Trump would go on to win the election when he had him on his show. And Jeselnik felt the same way in the fall of 2016. He was even pitching a show at the time based on the premise that with Hillary Clinton as president he could portray a villainous Trump-esque pundit in opposition to her, similar to the role Stephen Colbert ended up playing on The Colbert Report under President Obama.\n\n\u201cIt seemed insane that he could win. I just didn\u2019t believe that Americans would vote for him,\u201d Jeselnik says. \u201cBut then you look back and you\u2019re like, it wasn\u2019t that surprising.\u201d When he hears that \u201conly\u201d 40 percent of people approve of Trump, he imagines that another 20 percent say they don\u2019t like the president but then will go out and vote for him anyway.\n\n\u201cBut Jimmy\u2019s not a political guy and I think he took a beating that he shouldn\u2019t have taken,\u201d he says. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t win the election because Jimmy ruffled his hair. It may not have been a great look for Jimmy, but it didn\u2019t turn anything.\u201d\n\nHe does not feel the same way about the man who produces both Fallon\u2019s show and Saturday Night Live.\n\n\u201cI think Lorne Michaels helped get Trump elected,\u201d Jeselnik declares, unequivocally. \u201cI think putting him on SNL was way worse than the hair-ruffling thing.\u201d\n\nIn November of 2015, months after he announced his candidacy by calling Mexican immigrants \u201crapists,\u201d Donald Trump landed the coveted show business gig of hosting SNL\u2014for the second time. At the time, and even more so in retrospect, it was an embarrassing night for the iconic show and only helped elevate Trump\u2019s celebrity status.\n\n\u201cI was disgusted by it,\u201d Jeselnik says. \u201cIt was two rich guys helping each other out. I don\u2019t know how I would have dealt with it if I was on the show. I found it to be, quite frankly, revolting.\u201d\n\nJeselnik came close to being behind the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d desk that night. Before the show\u2019s 40th season started the previous fall, Michaels held auditions to replace Cecily Strong, who had been co-anchoring \u201cUpdate\u201d with Colin Jost. As Jeselnik explains it, they tried out about 10 different comics paired with Jost but he actually auditioned by himself.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be me and Jost together,\u201d Jeselnik says, positing that the show \u201cdidn\u2019t want two white guys sitting there next to each other.\u201d Plus, he adds, \u201cI work better by myself.\u201d His friend and fellow stand-up comic Michael Che ended up getting the position and still has it to this day.\n\n\u201cThat was the one job I\u2019ve ever wanted in my life,\u201d Jeselnik says of the SNL gig that has often gone to accomplished stand-ups. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly moved past it now. And even at the time I thought my chance to do it was over.\u201d\n\nHe says his best chance was probably when Seth Meyers left in the spring of 2014, but at that time he was hosting another show for Comedy Central and wasn\u2019t available. When he did get the call that fall, he thought, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get this but it\u2019s fun to have the audition and I\u2019m not going to mess it up. If I don\u2019t get this, it\u2019s not going to be my fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you go in, you\u2019re in a suit, you\u2019re on the set, you\u2019re sitting behind the desk,\u201d he says, \u201cand the camera comes down and you hear the announcer say, \u2018Welcome to Weekend Update with Anthony Jeselnik\u2019 and I just started laughing.\u201d Instead of a cheering crowd, there are a handful of producers sitting silently in the audience. He explains that it\u2019s \u201cset up for you to not do well\u201d but he \u201ckilled it\u201d anyway.\n\nDespite the infamous stories from cast members who say that Lorne Michaels never actually told them directly that they were hired or fired, Jeselnik got a personal call from the producer. \u201cLorne actually called me himself to say, you did a great job but we\u2019re going in this direction,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t argue with him. It\u2019s his show. Looking back on it now, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t get it.\u201d He says that former SNL writer John Mulaney told him, \u201cYou think you wanted that job,\u201d but that he \u201cwould have hated\u201d Michaels telling him what jokes he could and couldn\u2019t tell.\n\nEven more offensive to Jeselnik are reports from former cast members like Taran Killam that Michaels instructed writers not to \u201cvilify\u201d Trump in sketches when he was the host, telling them, \u201c you have to find a way in that makes him likable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if would have shown up for work that day,\u201d Jeselnik says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Former SNL cast member and host of Hiking with Kevin, Kevin Nealon.", "description": "The stand-up comic says he found it \u201crevolting\u201d when Trump hosted SNL: \u201cIt was two rich guys helping each other out.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567574067/190903-wilstein-Anthony-Jeselnik-tease_r8qbkg"}
